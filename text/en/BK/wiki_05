<text>The Leclerc is a third-generation French main battle tank developed and manufactured by KNDS France. It was named in honour of Marshal Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, a commander of the Free French Forces, who led the 2nd Armoured Division in World War II.

The Leclerc is in service with the French Army, Jordanian Army and the United Arab Emirates Army. In production since 1991, the Leclerc entered French service in 1992, replacing the AMX-30 as the country&#x27;s main armoured platform. With production now complete, the French operate 222 Leclercs (with 184 more in storage, for a total of 406), while the United Arab Emirates (UAE) possesses 388.

Of the units in French service, 200 will be upgraded to the Leclerc XLR standard with deliveries expected to begin in 2022. During the Eurosatory 2024 presented Leclerc Evolution and EMBT ADT140, prototypes of the enhanced fourth-generation main battle tank.

==History==
In 1964, studies were initiated about a possible replacement vehicle for the AMX-30 main battle tank: the &quot;Engin Principal Prospectif&quot;. In 1971, in view of the inferiority of the AMX-30 in comparison to the new generation of Soviet tanks about to be introduced, the &quot;Direction des Armements Terrestres&quot; ordered the beginning of the &quot;Char Futur&quot; project. In 1975, a working committee was created, and in 1977 it agreed on a list of specifications. In February 1980 however, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with West Germany involving the joint development of a MBT, called the &quot;Napoléon I&quot; in France and &quot;Kampfpanzer III&quot; in Germany. Fundamental disagreements about its desired configuration led to a failure of this cooperation in December 1982. It was announced that a purely French battle tank would be developed, called &quot;EPC&quot; (&quot;Engin Principal de Combat&quot;). The importation of foreign equipment, like the M1 Abrams, the Leopard 2, or the Merkava, had been studied and rejected.

In contrast to most Western programmes of the time, more emphasis was placed on active than passive protection to limit overall vehicle mass. Mobility for evading enemy fire and fire control systems were given particular attention. Nevertheless, it was a stated design goal to achieve at least double the protection against KE-penetrators in comparison to the level attained in then-current MBTs of the fifty-ton weight class, the latter indicated at about 400 mm RHA equivalency. The higher level of protection would also protect against shaped charges.

Partnership with a foreign state was sought to limit unit cost, and found when the UAE ordered 436 vehicles, adding to the 426 units already planned for the French Army.

In 1986, the project was started under the name &quot;Leclerc&quot;, and six prototypes were swiftly built. Mass production started in 1990 with the four-unit Batch 1, used mainly for comparative tests in foreign countries. The 17 units of Batch 2 shipped with turret and hull armour improvements, but were diagnosed with engine and suspension problems and quickly retired. Batch 3 followed with further improvements and used to define the doctrine of use as well as instruction. Batches 4 and 5 were better built, eliminating recurring powerplant problems, and are still in service after having been refitted in the late 1990s.

The second series started with Batch 6, with an added climate control system in the right rear of the turret. Batch 7 introduced a transmission system to the command vehicle, and a data system giving instantaneous vision of the state of all battle tanks and acquired targets. It also incorporated minor improvements in the visor. Batch 8 units had a modernised electronic system, and Batch 9 replaced the ATHOS thermal imaging with a SAGEM Iris providing better resolution.

In 2003, the Greek army sought to acquire a new tank and tested the T-80U, T-84, Leclerc, M1A2 Abrams, Challenger 2E and Leopard 2A5. The Leclerc received a perfect score at the firing range, with 20 rounds fired from 1500 and at 2000 m away. Its hunter-kill test performance was weaker, with the Leclerc scoring 13 out of 20, compared with 17 for the Leopard. Both the Leclerc and Leopard sustained a nine-round-per-minute firing rate, higher than those of the other tanks. The Leclerc achieved a 500 km range, higher than the others. But price tags seemed to be a determining factor and the Greek Army selected the Leopard.

All previous Leclerc batches were to be modernised to Batch 9 standards as of 2005. In 2004, Batch 10 was presented, incorporating a new armour package and information systems that could share the location of enemy and friendly units with all vehicles on the battlefield. This was the beginning of the 96-unit third series. By 2007, 355 tanks were to have been operational, 320 of them incorporated in four regiments, each with 80 Leclercs.

, after a French defence review, each of the four regiments operated 60 Leclerc tanks for a total of 240 in operational units; with a further 100 in combat ready reserve. Due to financial cuts, only 254 tanks were fully operational in 2011.

=== Main Ground Combat System ===
In 2015, Nexter Systems merged with German Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW), maker of the Leopard 2 tank, to form KMW+Nexter Defense Systems (KNDS), and the German Ministry of Defence announced plans to develop a new tank jointly with France as a successor to both the Leopard 2 and Leclerc tanks, named Main Ground Combat System (MGCS). At the 2018 Eurosatory, KNDS presented a technology demonstrator tank combining the hull of a Leopard 2A7 with the lighter, two-man turret of a Leclerc.

System architecture definition and technology demonstration phase was to be completed by 2024, with production and testing to start in 2028.

===UAE bribery allegation===
In September 2018, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; reported that an intermediary in the $3 billion-plus UAE tank sale was paid a commission of nearly US$200 million, and that part of the sum may have been used to bribe government officials.

==Design==
===Armament===
====Primary====

The Leclerc is armed with a 120 mm version F1 smoothbore gun designed by the arsenal of Bourges (EFAB) under the designation of CN120-26. Its barrel is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibre common on most main battle tanks of its generation, giving the projectile a higher muzzle velocity.

The Modèle F1 is compatible with 120x570mm NATO ammunition. This gun features a magnesium alloy thermal sleeve and an automatic loading mechanism. Elevation (+20°), depression (-8°), and turret traverse (360°) are electrically powered. The Leclerc EMAT used by the French Army relies on compartment overpressure for barrel fume extraction while the UAE tropicalized Leclerc uses a compressed-air fume extraction system.

====Autoloader====
Located inside the turret bustle, the autoloader is designated CHA (, &quot;automatic loading&quot;) and was designed by Creusot-Loire Industrie. The autoloader itself weighs 500 kg (empty) and has a total volume of 1.68 m (1.40 × 2.40 × 0.50 m). In case of ammunition cooking off, the deflagration is vented by two blow-out panels.

The autoloader allows the reloading of the gun while firing on the move, providing it a sufficient rate of fire to deal with six targets in one minute. The nominal firing sequence is below 8 seconds and the repetition rate (loading two ammunition of the same type one after another) is below 6 seconds. The autoloader is managed by a TM Motorola 68021 microprocessor.

The autoloader consists of a continuous link carrier magazine made of 22 cells and a rammer assembly. It can accommodate all types of ammunition that are to the NATO standard. Up to six different types of ammunition can be selected.
The cell positions the selected round for loading. At the same time, the main gun is decoupled from the stabilization system, indexed to 1.8° elevation and locked in alignment with the loading gutter. Then, a telescopic rammer pushes the round from the cell into the gun breech via a fiberglass gutter. After loading, the weapon is automatically driven back to the specified angle in accordance with the fire control system.
In case of a power outage, the conveyor can be put into motion by using a hand-cranked electric generator.

The ammunition is normally inserted in the autoloader through a port in the rear wall of the turret bustle. A control panel allows the autoloader cells to be rotated to present a new empty cell. Two barcode readers identify the introduced ammunition in order to manage its position in the conveyor at any time. If the ammunition does not have a barcode, its type is entered through the control keyboard. It is possible to replenish the autoloader under armour, through a port in the inner bulkhead by using the 18 rounds cylinder located to the right of the driver&#x27;s position.

====Secondary====
The Leclerc is also equipped with a 12.7 mm coaxial M2 heavy machine gun and a turret-mounted 7.62 mm machine gun, whereas most other NATO tanks use 7.62 mm weapons for both their coaxial and top machine gun mounts; the major exception is the American M1 Abrams, which has a 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun and two top-mounted machine guns, one 7.62 mm and one 12.7 mm.

===Fire control and observation===
The last 96 MBT XL Leclerc tanks have the &quot;ICONE TIS&quot; battle management system with digital communication system which integrates data from other tanks and upper levels of command. Since 2009, all the Leclerc tanks in service (S2 and SXXI) have ICONE BMS.
The digital fire control system can be operated independently by the gunner or the commander, and it offers real time integrated imaging from all of the tank&#x27;s sensors and sights, including the gunner&#x27;s SAVAN 20 stabilised sight, developed by SAGEM.
The Leclerc tank features the HL 60 gunner&#x27;s primary sight from SAGEM. The sight has two day channels; a direct one with ×3.3 and ×10 magnification (×14 in case of the UAE version) and a video channel with ×10 magnification. The thermal channel offers ×3 and ×10 magnifications.
The &quot;Athos&quot; thermal imager has a detection range of 5000 m, can recognize targets at 2500 m and identify them at 2000 m. The laser range finder is of the Nd:YAG type. No emergency or auxiliary sights are mounted.

The tank commander can observe the surroundings through 7 episcopes and the SFIM HL 70 stabilized panoramic sight. The HL 70 is equipped with a day channel at ×2.5 and ×10 magnification and a night channel with ×2.5 magnification.
The UAE tropicalized Leclerc uses the improved HL 80 panoramic sight which features an electronic zoom ×2 and a laser range finder of the type. The image intensifier is replaced by an &quot;Alis&quot; thermal imager.
The Leclerc SXXI uses the HL 120 panoramic sight that incorporates an &quot;Iris&quot; thermal imager.
Both sights are also equipped with a semi-auto tracker for target acquisition. The combination of the gunner&#x27;s primary sight and commander&#x27;s panoramic sight allows the Leclerc to operate in a hunter-killer mode.

===Protection===
==== Thermal signature ====
A feature of the Hyperbar system used by the V8X1500 engine is that it does not emit visible smoke during acceleration, allowing to reduce the infrared signature of the tank.
The exhaust temperature of the TM-307B gas turbine never exceeds 370°, whatever the engine speed.

==== Ballistic ====
The AMX-APX armament institution was responsible for the studies related to the configuration and the integration of the new ballistic protection concepts.

Original protection requirements were sent by the EPC project manager to AMX-APX on February 8, 1980. The protection of the future French main battle tank must guarantee a certain degree of invulnerability against 125 mm APFSDS and 130 mm shaped-charges warheads over its frontal arc. The whole fighting compartment must be protected against RPG-7 warheads and all-around protection should be provided against threats such as 30 mm autocannons.

Stéphane Ferrard (1947-2015), a military historian and French journalist, stated in his book, &quot;The Leclerc System&quot;, that:

The turret and the hull are made of welded steel plates with a thickness ranging from 30 mm to 50 mm on which removable composite armour modules are mounted. Twelve modules surround the turret (six per side); they are numbered 1 to 6, starting from the front end. The modules are covered by an anti-slip coating made of fiberglass.
The turret bustle that contains the autoloader is protected on both sides against 30 mm armour-piercing rounds and shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon such as the RPG-7.
The composite storage boxes around and on the turret play a triple role: carrying the tool set, reducing radar cross-section and acting as spaced armour.

Structural self-sealing fuel tanks are located to the right forward part of the hull, in front and above the ammunition drum. Six heavy ballistic side skirts protect the front third of the hull sides; each is made of a composite panel covered by a steel outer shell.

===== SXXI =====

At the end of 1990s, a study was initiated to protect the Leclerc tank against the latest threats. These included ATGMs with tandem shaped-charge warheads capable of penetrating more than 1000 mm of RHA steel, as well as long-rod APFSDS with a length-to-diameter ratio of 30:1 with penetration performance exceeding 700 mm of RHA.

The technical approach consisted of replacing the passive composite modules protecting both sides of the turret bustle with lighter, reactive modules, incorporating semi-reactive layers. This weight-saving measure allowed the use of titanium in the ballistic protection of the turret frontal arc. It also shifted the center of gravity towards the front of the turret, closer to the traverse axis, facilitating the dynamic laying of the turret drives.

Block 10 and 11 (T10 and T11) Leclerc SXXI tanks are recognizable by their add-on ceramic armour plates bolted on the top of the reactive modules, protecting both sides of the autoloader compartment.

==== Passive counter-measures ====
Fourteen 80 mm dispensers of the Lacroix GALIX self-defence system are mounted onto the rear part of the turret. The French Army uses four types of ammunition:
* Galix 3: three smoke grenades creating an opaque screen in the visual range for 50 seconds
* Galix 4: two fragmentation grenades
* Galix 6: one infrared decoy with a burn time of 10 seconds
* Galix 13: three smoke grenades creating an opaque screen in the visual and infrared ranges for 30 seconds

===Propulsion===

The Leclerc has an eight-cylinder SACM (now Wärtsilä) V8X-1500 1,500 hp Hyperbar diesel engine and a SESM (now Renk AG) automatic transmission, with five forward and two reverse gears. The official maximum speed by road is 71 km/h and 55 km/h cross country (speeds in excess of 80 km/h were reported on road). The maximum range is given as 550 km, and can be extended to 650 km with removable external tanks. The &quot;hyperbar&quot; system integrates a small Turbomeca TM 307B gas turbine in the engine, acting both as a turbocharger and an APU giving auxiliary power to all systems when the main engine is shut down. The Hyperbar name comes from the unusually high boost pressure of 7.5 bar and the resulting mean effective pressure of 32.1 bar. For comparison, the turbocharged diesel engine in a typical passenger car has a mean effective pressure of about 20 bar. In addition, with boost available even when idling, this arrangement also works as an antilag system.

With a combat weight of 56 tons, the Leclerc is one of the lighter main battle tanks in the world, though still considerably heavier than Soviet and later Russian designs; this gives it one of the best power-to-weight ratios among Western tanks (27 hp per ton) and makes it one of the fastest MBTs of its generation (0 to 32 km/h in 5 seconds).

The engine exhaust, exiting at the rear left, is cooled to reduce the thermal signature of the Leclerc. Transmission is hydromechanical, with five forward and two reverse gears. Fuel tanks carry 1,300 litres and act as extra protection for the tank; two 200-litre external tanks can be fitted on the rear of the hull, though they have to be jettisoned before entering combat because they limit turret rotation.

The gearbox is equipped with a hydrokinetic retarder, which can slow the Leclerc down at a deceleration rate of 7 m/s (0.7 g) which is automatically used over 30 km/h.

==Operational history==
The four regiments which operate the Leclerc are:
* 1e régiment de chasseurs stationed near Verdun, part of the 7th Armoured Brigade
* 4e régiment de dragons stationed in Carnoux-en-Provence, part of the 7th Armoured Brigade
* 12e régiment de cuirassiers stationed in Olivet, part of the 2nd Armoured Brigade
* 501e régiment de chars de combat stationed in Mourmelon-le-Grand, 2nd Armoured Brigade

In service since 1992 (after the Persian Gulf War), the Leclerc has mostly seen deployment in low-intensity conflicts, including 15 &quot;Leclerc &quot;stationed in Kosovo (KFOR) and 13 others deployed in south Lebanon until 2010 for the UNIFIL peacekeeping operations, during which their performance was judged satisfactory by French officials.

As of August 2015, Leclerc tanks of the UAE were deployed in combat operations in Yemen (near Aden) as part of the Saudi-led coalition. It is estimated that 70 Leclerc MBTs were deployed by the UAE in Yemen, 15 of them equipped with the AZUR package. During one month, three tanks were damaged, two by antitank mines and one by an RPG, which damaged the grid without piercing the hull. One of the episcopes was hit by a ATGM, possibly of Konkurs or Konkurs-M type, killing the driver and injuring the commander&#x27;s legs. None of these tanks were completely destroyed.

During the Iron Spear exercise, October 2019, Leclerc tanks crewed by the Lynx 6 Tactical Inter-Service Sub-Group (S-GTIA) participated in an inter-alliance exercise and surpassed the American M1A2 Abrams, German, Spanish and Norwegian Leopard 2s, Italian C1 Ariete and Polish PT-91.&lt;br&gt;

As part of Mission Aigle, Leclerc tanks of the 1st Chasseur Regiment, 7th Armoured Brigade were deployed to Romania in November 2022. Currently, there are 13 tanks deployed with the Battle Group Forward Presence.

Leclerc T4: Prototype with an elongated turret built in 1996. It was armed with a 140 mm smoothbore gun designed by the arsenal of Bourges (EFAB). In order to avoid being scrapped, the prototype turret was restored in the 2010s and mounted on a former Leclerc hull which was used in its last years as a towing vehicle. Following its restoration, the tank was nicknamed &quot;Terminateur&quot; (Terminator) by the director of the technical section of the French Army (&quot;Section Technique de l&#x27;Armée de Terre&quot; or STAT), who did everything to preserve this technological demonstrator.
In 2017, the Terminateur was presented with the experimental Scorpion camouflage.

*Leclerc PTG (&quot;Poseur de Travure du Génie)&quot;: proposed bridgelayer variant developed in 1996, no prototypes were built.
*Leclerc &#x27;Flakpanzer&#x27; SPAAG: Early 1990s proposal of a Leclerc fitted with a turret derived from that of the German Flakpanzer Gepard. It was imagined as armed with twin 35 mm Oerlikon KDA autocannons and two twin pack Mistral SAM launchers (total of four ready missiles). It was not adopted for service due to post-Cold War defence cutbacks.
*Leclerc Crotale: A proposal from the same time period to fit the Crotale NG SAM system to a Leclerc chassis. Intended primarily to protect armoured formations on the move against aerial attack. Again not proceeded with due to cutbacks. No prototype known to have been built.

<text>Police Sergeant Major Merire BEM from Gomema village, Waria, Morobe Patrol Post, Lae was a member of the Royal Papuan and New Guinea Constabulary who joined the police force in 1936. On the occasion of the Japanese landings at Madang in 1942, he was able to move all the residents with their supplies into the forest to avoid capture. His subsequent observations as far along the coast as Finschhafen served to guide U.S. bombing raids on Japanese positions.

Merire was captured on several occasions, but still always managed to escape with new information. When Australian troops initiated a recapture of the island, his service as a guide was invaluable. For his efforts he was awarded the British Empire Medal, and in 1952 was featured on a stamp of Papua New Guinea.

<text>Marion Michael Rounds (born October 24, 1954) is an American businessman and politician serving as the junior United States senator from South Dakota since 2015. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 31st governor of South Dakota from 2003 to 2011.

Rounds was raised in Pierre, South Dakota. He attended South Dakota State University, where he earned his Bachelor of Science degree. He was elected to the South Dakota Senate in 1990, representing the 24th district until 2001. Rounds ran for governor of South Dakota in 2002, and after an upset victory in the Republican primary, defeated Democratic nominee Jim Abbott. He was reelected in 2006, but was term limited from running for a third consecutive term in 2010.

In 2014, Rounds was elected to the United States Senate, succeeding retiring Democrat Tim Johnson. He was reelected in 2020 over Democratic nominee Dan Ahlers.

==Early life, education, and business career==
The eldest of 11 children, Rounds was born in Huron, South Dakota, the son of Joyce (née Reinartz) and Don Rounds. He has German, Belgian, Swedish and English ancestry. Rounds has lived in the state capital of Pierre since he was three years old. He was named for an uncle, Marion Rounds, who was killed in the Pacific theater during World War II. Several members of the Rounds family have been involved in state government. His father worked at various times as state director of highway safety, a staffer for the Rural Electrification Administration, and executive director of the South Dakota Petroleum Council. His brother Tim Rounds was a member of the South Dakota House of Representatives, representing District 24, which includes Pierre, from 2003 to 2011 and from 2013 to 2021.

Rounds attended South Dakota State University in Brookings, where he earned his Bachelor of Science in political science.

Rounds is a former partner in Fischer Rounds &amp; Associates, an insurance and real estate firm with offices in Pierre, Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown and Sioux Falls.

==South Dakota Senate==

===Elections===
Rounds represented District 24, which was based in Pierre. In 1990, he defeated incumbent state Senator Jacqueline Kelley, 53%–47%. He was reelected in 1992 (60%), 1994 (77%), 1996 (66%), and 1998 (75%). Rounds had to leave the Senate in 2001 because of legislative term limits South Dakota voters had passed in 1992.

===Tenure===
Rounds represented Hughes, Lyman, Stanley, and Sully counties. In 1993, he became Senate Minority Whip. In 1995, his peers selected him to be Senate Majority Leader.

==Governor of South Dakota==
===Elections===

==== 2002 ====

As the 2002 race for governor took shape, media and political observers largely dismissed Rounds as an extreme long shot. Until late 2001, then-Congressman John Thune was the front-runner for the nomination. When Thune passed on the race to challenge Senator Tim Johnson, state Attorney General Mark Barnett and former Lieutenant Governor Steve T. Kirby became candidates.

Rounds benefited from the heated competition between Kirby and Barnett, much of which centered on ethical concerns about Kirby&#x27;s personal business investments and damaged both candidates&#x27; reputations, with Barnett&#x27;s campaign advertisements involving claims &quot;so outlandish that people thought for sure that they were exaggerated or completely fabricated&quot;. By staying above the fray, Rounds won the primary by 15 points.

After winning the Republican nomination, Rounds chose State Senator Dennis Daugaard of Dell Rapids as his running mate. Their Democratic opponents were University of South Dakota President Jim Abbott of Vermillion and his running mate, former State Representative Mike Wilson of Rapid City.

Rounds was elected governor on November 5, 2002. The results were as follows:
*Republicans: Rounds and Daugaard, 56.8%
*Democrats: Abbott and Wilson, 41.9%
*Independent: Jim Carlson and Ron Bosch, 0.7%
*Libertarians: Nathan Barton and Eric Risty, 0.6%

==== 2006 ====

Two Democratic candidates emerged to challenge Rounds: Jack Billion, a retired surgeon and former state legislator from Sioux Falls, and Dennis Wiese, the former president of the South Dakota Farmers Union. Billion easily won the nomination and selected Rapid City school board member Eric Abrahamson as his running mate.

The Rounds/Daugaard ticket was reelected on November 7, 2006. The results were as follows:
*Republicans: Rounds and Daugaard, 61.7%
*Democrats: Billion and Abrahamson, 36.1%
*Constitution: Steven J. Willis and Larry Johnsen, 1.2%
*Libertarians: Tom Gerber and Betty Rose Ryan, 1.0%

===Tenure===
Rounds served as a member of the Governors&#x27; Council at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He was the 2008 Chair of the Midwestern Governors Association.

===Issues===

====Research centers====
Rounds&#x27;s 2010 Initiative established ten research centers at state-supported universities. In the program&#x27;s first four years, the state&#x27;s first five research centers generated an estimated $59 million in federal and private funding, with an estimated $110 million economic impact.

====Abortion====

On February 22, 2006, the state legislature of South Dakota passed an act banning all medical abortions except those necessary to save the mother&#x27;s life. Rounds signed the act on March 6 and the ban was to have taken effect on July 1, 2006, but did not, because of a court challenge. A referendum on repealing H.B. 1215 was placed on the ballot for the November 2006 statewide election due to a petition. On May 30, over 38,000 signatures were filed, more than twice the 17,000 required to qualify. Voters repealed the law on November 7, 2006, the day of Rounds&#x27;s reelection.

====EB-5 Visa inquiry====
During Rounds&#x27;s administration, South Dakota offered green cards to foreign investors in exchange for investments in a new South Dakota beef packing plant and other economic investments through the EB-5 visa program the federal government established in 1990. After the beef packing plant went bankrupt, questions emerged about the nature of the investments and the foreign investors. Some investors received neither their EB-5 visas nor the money back from their failed investments, with no indication as to where their money went.

State officials misused funds to pay for their salaries, did not disclose that they owned companies which they gave contracts to, directed money to companies that went bankrupt and arranged for loans from unknown sources from shell companies located in tax havens. In October 2014, Rounds admitted that he had approved a $1 million state loan to beef packing plant Northern Beef shortly after learning that Secretary of Tourism and State Development Richard Benda had agreed to join the company, with Benda then getting another $600,000 in state loans that was ultimately used to pay his own salary. Benda committed suicide in October 2013, days before a possible indictment over embezzlement and grand theft charges.

====3D-printed weapons====
Of 3D-printed weapons, Rounds has said, &quot;This is a new technology which you&#x27;re not going to put back into the bottle. It is there.&quot; He has suggested creating and using new technologies, such as metal detectors that can also recognize plastic, in schools, airports and other public places.

==U.S. Senate==

===Election===

==== 2014 ====

Speculation persisted that in 2014 Rounds would seek the United States Senate seat held by Tim Johnson, a Democrat who had served since 1997. Johnson opted not to run for reelection.

On November 29, 2012, Rounds launched a campaign for the seat being vacated by Johnson&#x27;s retirement. He won the June 2014 Republican primary, defeating four other candidates. Early polls showed Rounds leading by a 2–1 margin against Democratic opponent Rick Weiland. October 2014 polls showed a closer three-way race between Rounds, Weiland, and independent former Senator Larry Pressler. Independent conservative former state legislator Gordon Howie was also in the race.

In November Rounds was elected with a majority of the vote. The results were:

*Republican: Rounds, 50.37%
*Democrat: Weiland, 29.51%
*Independent: Pressler, 17.09%
*Independent: Howie, 3.03%

====2020====

In the 2020 election, Scyller Borglum, a first-term member of the South Dakota House of Representatives, challenged Rounds in the Republican primary. Borglum positioned herself as an ally of Donald Trump. Rounds defeated Borglum, 75% to 25%. He won the general election against Democratic nominee Dan Ahlers with nearly 66% of the vote.

===Tenure===
====Artificial Intelligence====
Rounds co-chairs the Senate AI Caucus and was one of the four members of the Bipartisan Senate AI Working Group led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. On May 15, 2024, the group released a report recommending actions for the federal government to take to regulate and support AI development. The report recommended $32 billion of annual funding for development of non-defense AI. Rounds has introduced several bills on AI, including one establishing a national biomedical database and provide for additional regulation of AI in financial services.

====Education====
In February 2019, Rounds was one of 20 senators to sponsor the Employer Participation in Repayment Act, enabling employers to contribute up to $5,250 to their employees&#x27; student loans as a means of granting them relief and incentivizing people to apply for jobs with employers who implement the policy. In November 2024, he introduced a bill in the Senate that proposes the abolishment of the Department of Education.

====Environment====
In 2017, Rounds was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Rounds has received over $200,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012. Rounds supported embattled Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, who had come under scrutiny because of extraordinary expenditures for personal security and luxury travel, and the appearances of ethical conflicts, defending him on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Calling the criticism &quot;nitpicking&quot;, he said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how much of it is overblown and how much of it is accurate, to be honest.&quot;

====Criminal justice====
Rounds opposed the FIRST STEP Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill that Trump signed into law. The bill passed 87–12 on December 18, 2018.

====Israel Anti-Boycott Act====
In March 2018, Rounds co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (s. 720), which would make it a federal crime for Americans to encourage or participate in boycotts against Israel and Israeli settlements in the West Bank if protesting actions by the Israeli government.

====Health care====
Rounds opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), and has voted to repeal it. In 2019, he said he supported lawsuits seeking to overturn it.

====2020 presidential election====
On January 9, 2022, Rounds said that the 2020 presidential election was not stolen from Donald Trump: &quot;[We] looked at over 60 different accusations made in multiple states. While there were some irregularities, there were none of the irregularities which would have risen to the point where they would have changed the vote outcome in a single state&quot;. Rounds said the election was fair, and added that Republicans should stop making arguments to the contrary: &quot;If we simply look back and tell our people, &#x27;Don&#x27;t vote because there&#x27;s cheating going on,&#x27; then we&#x27;re going to put ourselves in a huge disadvantage. So, moving forward, let&#x27;s focus on what it takes to win those elections. We can do that.&quot; Trump responded by calling Rounds a &quot;jerk&quot;, &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; and accused him of being &quot;woke&quot; for acknowledging the election results.

====2021 United States Capitol attack====
On May 28, 2021, Rounds abstained from voting on the creation of the January 6 commission.

====2024 presidential election====
Rounds endorsed Senator Tim Scott for the Republican nomination in the 2024 United States presidential election. In an interview on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Rounds refused to commit to supporting the eventual Republican nominee if Scott was not nominated. Scott suspended his campaign on November 12, 2023, and not long after, Rounds endorsed Trump.

<doc id="375375" wikidata="Q311782" url="?curid=375375" title="Bill Richardson">
<text>William Blaine Richardson III (November 15, 1947 – September 1, 2023) was an American politician, author, and diplomat who served as the 30th governor of New Mexico from 2003 to 2011. He was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the Clinton administration, a U.S. congressman, chair of the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and chair of the Democratic Governors Association (DGA).

In December 2008, Richardson was nominated for the cabinet-level position of Secretary of Commerce in the first Obama administration but withdrew a month later, as he was being investigated for possible improper business dealings. Although the investigation was later dropped, it damaged Richardson&#x27;s popularity and diminished his influence as his second and final term as New Mexico governor concluded.

Richardson occasionally provided advice on diplomatic issues pertaining to North Korea and visited the nation on several occasions, including efforts to release American detainees. He completed a number of private humanitarian missions, one of which secured the release of U.S. journalist Danny Fenster from a Myanmar prison in November 2021.

==Early life and education==
William Blaine Richardson III was born in Pasadena, California, on November 15, 1947. He grew up in the borough of Coyoacán in Mexico City. His father, William Blaine Richardson Jr. (1891–1972), who was of Anglo-American and Mexican descent, was an American bank executive from Boston who worked in Mexico for what is now Citibank. Richardson&#x27;s father was born on a ship heading towards Nicaragua.

His mother, María Luisa López-Collada Márquez (1914–2011), had been his father&#x27;s secretary—she was the Mexican-born daughter of a Mexican mother and a Spanish father from Villaviciosa, Asturias. Just before Bill Richardson was born, his father sent his mother to California to give birth because, as Richardson explained, &quot;My father had a complex about not having been born in the United States.&quot;

Richardson, a United States citizen by birth, spent his childhood in a lavish hacienda in Coyoacán&#x27;s barrio of San Francisco where he was raised as a Roman Catholic. When Richardson was 13, his parents sent him to the U.S. to attend Middlesex School, a preparatory school in Concord, Massachusetts, where he played baseball as a pitcher. He entered Tufts University in 1966, where he continued to play baseball.

In 1967, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League, pitching for the Cotuit Kettleers; he returned to the league in 1968 with the Harwich Mariners. A Kettleers program included the words &quot;Drafted by K.C.&quot; Richardson said:

 Richardson&#x27;s original biographies stated he had been drafted by the Kansas City Athletics and the Chicago Cubs to play professional baseball, but a 2005 &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; investigation discovered he never was on any official draft. Richardson acknowledged the error, which he maintained was unintentional, saying he had been scouted by several teams and told that he &quot;would or could&quot; be drafted, but he was mistaken in saying that he actually had been drafted.

Richardson earned a Bachelor&#x27;s degree at Tufts University in 1970, majoring in French and political science, and was a member and president of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in international affairs from the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in 1971. He had met his future wife Barbara (née Flavin) when they were in high school in Concord, Massachusetts, and they married in 1972 following her graduation from Wheaton College.

Richardson was a descendant of William Brewster, a passenger on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

==Early political career==
After college, Richardson worked for Republican Congressman F. Bradford Morse from Massachusetts from 1971 to 1973. In 1974, he left to work on congressional relations for the Kissinger State Department during the Nixon administration. Between 1976 and 1978 he was a staff member for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

==U.S. Representative (1983–1997)==
In 1978, Richardson moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1980 he ran for the House of Representatives in the state&#x27;s 1st congressional district, but lost narrowly to longtime Republican incumbent and future United States Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan. Two years later, Richardson was elected to New Mexico&#x27;s newly created third district, which took in most of the northern part of the state. Richardson spent 14 years in Congress, representing the country&#x27;s most diverse district and holding 2,000 town meetings.

Richardson served as Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in the 98th Congress (1984–1985) and as Chair of the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Native American Affairs in the 103rd Congress (1993–1994). Richardson sponsored a number of bills, including the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994, the Indian Dams Safety Act, the Tribal Self-Governance Act, and the Jicarilla Apache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act.

He became a member of the Democratic leadership as a deputy majority whip, where he became friends with Bill Clinton after they worked closely on several issues, including when he served as the ranking House Democrat in favor of NAFTA&#x27;s passage in 1993. For his work as a back channel to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mexico&#x27;s president at the time of the negotiations, he was awarded the Aztec Eagle Award, Mexico&#x27;s highest award for a foreigner. Clinton in turn sent Richardson on various foreign policy missions, including a trip in 1995 in which Richardson traveled to Baghdad with Peter Bourne and engaged in lengthy one-on-one negotiations with Saddam Hussein to secure the release of two American aerospace workers who had been captured by the Iraqis after wandering over the Kuwaiti border. Richardson also visited Nicaragua, Guatemala, Cuba, Peru, India, North Korea, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Sudan to represent U.S. interests and met with Slobodan Milošević.

In 1996, he played a major role in securing the release of American Evan Hunziker from North Korean custody and for securing a pardon for Eliadah McCord, an American convicted and imprisoned in Bangladesh. Due to these missions, Richardson was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times.

==Ambassador to the United Nations (1997–1998)==
Richardson served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from February 1997 to August 1998. 
In 1997, working alongside Nelson Mandela, he helped negotiate the transfer of power between Mobutu Sese Seko and Laurent-Désiré Kabila at the conclusion of the First Congo War. In 1998 he flew to Afghanistan to meet with the Taliban and Abdul Rachid Dostum, an Uzbek warlord. The ceasefire he believed he had negotiated with the help of Bruce Riedel of the National Security Council failed to hold; neither was he successful in convincing the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden.

==U.S. Secretary of Energy (1998–2001)==

The Senate confirmed Richardson to be Clinton&#x27;s Secretary of Energy on July 31, 1998. His tenure at the Department of Energy was marred by the Wen Ho Lee nuclear controversy. As told by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in a special report, a scientist later named as Lee at the Los Alamos National Laboratory was reported as a suspect who might have given nuclear secrets to the People&#x27;s Republic of China government. The article mentioned Richardson several times, although he denied in sworn testimony that he was the source or that he made improper disclosures. After being fired and spending nine months in solitary confinement as an alleged security risk, Lee was later cleared of espionage charges and released with an apology from the judge. Eventually, Lee won a $1.6 million settlement against the federal government and several news outlets, including the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, for the accusation. Richardson was also criticized by the United States Senate for his handling of the espionage inquiry, which involved missing computer hard drives containing sensitive data, and for not testifying in front of Congress sooner. Richardson justified his response by saying that he was waiting to uncover more information before speaking to Congress. Republican Senators called for Richardson&#x27;s resignation, while both parties criticized his role in the incident, and the scandal ended Richardson&#x27;s hope of being named as Al Gore&#x27;s running mate for the 2000 presidential election.

Richardson tightened security following the scandal, leading to the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA, not to be confused with the NSA and the NSC). This foreshadowed the creation of the Department of Homeland Security in reaction to the 9/11 attacks. He created the Director for Native American Affairs position in the department in 1998, and in January 2000, oversaw the largest return of federal lands, 84,000 acres (340 km2), to a Native American Tribe (the Northern Ute Tribe of Utah) in more than 100 years. Richardson also directed the overhaul of the department&#x27;s consultation policy with Native American tribes and established the Tribal Energy Program.

==Post–cabinet career (2001–2003)==

With the end of the Clinton administration in January 2001, Richardson took on a number of different positions. He was an adjunct professor at Harvard Kennedy School and a lecturer at the United World College of the American West (UWC-USA), and also taught at the University of New Mexico, and New Mexico State University. In 2000, Richardson was awarded a United States Institute of Peace Senior Fellowship. He spent the next year researching and writing on the negotiations with North Korea and the energy dimensions of U.S. relations. In 2011, Richardson was named a senior fellow at the Baker Institute of Rice University.

Richardson joined Kissinger McLarty Associates, a &quot;strategic advisory firm&quot; headed by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Clinton White House chief of staff Mack McLarty, as Senior Managing Director.

From February 2001 to June 2002, he served on the board of directors of Peregrine Systems. He also served on the corporate boards of several energy companies, including Valero Energy Corporation and Diamond Offshore Drilling. He withdrew from these boards after being nominated by the Democratic Party for governor of New Mexico, but retained considerable stock holdings in Valero and Diamond Offshore. He would later sell these stocks during his campaign for president in 2007, saying he was &quot;getting questions&quot; about the propriety of these holdings, especially given his past as energy secretary, and that it had become a distraction.

Richardson was on the board of directors of the National Institute for Civil Discourse (NICD), which was created after the 2011 Tucson shooting of Congresswoman Gabby Giffords.

==Governor of New Mexico (2003–2011)==

===First term===

Richardson was elected governor of New Mexico in November 2002, having defeated the Republican nominee, John Sanchez, 56–39%. During the campaign, he set a Guinness World Record for most handshakes in eight hours by a politician, breaking Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s record. He succeeded a two-term Republican governor, Gary Johnson. He took office in January 2003 as the only Hispanic Governor in the United States. In his first year, Richardson proposed &quot;tax cuts to promote growth and investment&quot; and passed a broad personal income tax cut and won a statewide special election to transfer money from the state&#x27;s Permanent Fund to meet current expenses and projects. In early 2005, Richardson helped make New Mexico the first state in the nation to provide $400,000 in life insurance coverage for New Mexico National Guard members who serve on active duty. Thirty-five states have since followed suit.

Working with the legislature, he formed Richardson&#x27;s Investment Partnership (GRIP) in 2003. The partnership has been used to fund large-scale public infrastructure projects throughout New Mexico, including the use of highway funds to construct a brand new commuter rail line (the Rail Runner) that runs between Belen, Albuquerque, and Bernalillo. He supported a variety of LGBT rights in his career as governor; he added sexual orientation and gender identity to New Mexico&#x27;s list of civil rights categories. However, he was opposed to same-sex marriage, and he faced criticism for his use of the anti-gay slur &quot;maricón&quot; on Don Imus&#x27;s morning radio show in March 2006.

During the summer of 2003, he met with a delegation from North Korea at its request to discuss concerns over that country&#x27;s nuclear weapons. At the request of the White House, he also flew to North Korea in 2005 and met with another North Korean delegation in 2006. On December 7, 2006, Secretary General of the Organization of American States José Miguel Insulza named Richardson his Special Envoy for Hemispheric Affairs with the mandate to &quot;promote dialogue on issues of importance to the region, such as immigration and free trade&quot;.

In 2003, Richardson backed and signed legislation creating a permit system for New Mexicans to carry concealed handguns. He applied for and received a concealed weapons permit, though by his own admission he seldom carries a gun.

As Richardson discussed frequently during his 2008 run for president, he supported a controversial New Mexico law allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver&#x27;s licenses for reasons of public safety. He said that because of the program, traffic fatalities had gone down, and the percentage of uninsured drivers decreased from 33% to 11%.

Richardson was named Chair of the Democratic Governors Association in 2004 and announced a desire to increase the role of Democratic governors in deciding the party&#x27;s future.

In December 2005, Richardson announced the intention of New Mexico to collaborate with billionaire Richard Branson to bring space tourism to the proposed Spaceport America located near Las Cruces. In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; credited Richardson&#x27;s reforms in naming Albuquerque the best city in the United States for business and careers. The Cato Institute, meanwhile, consistently rated Richardson as one of the most fiscally responsible Democratic governors in the nation.

In March 2006, Richardson vetoed legislation that would ban the use of eminent domain to transfer property to private developers, as allowed by the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2005 decision in &quot;Kelo v. City of New London&quot;. He promised to work with the legislature to draft new legislation addressing the issue in the 2007 legislative session.

On September 7, 2006, Richardson flew to Sudan to meet President Omar Al-Bashir and successfully negotiated the release of imprisoned journalist Paul Salopek. The Sudanese had charged Salopek with espionage on August 26, 2006, while on a &quot;National Geographic&quot; assignment. In January 2007, at the request of the Save Darfur Coalition, he brokered a 60-day cease-fire between al-Bashir and leaders of several rebel factions in the western Sudanese region of Darfur. The cease-fire never became effective, however, with allegations of breaches on all sides.

===Second term===

Richardson won his second term as Governor of New Mexico on November 7, 2006, 68–32% against former New Mexico Republican Party Chairman John Dendahl. Richardson received the highest percentage of votes in any gubernatorial election in the state&#x27;s history.

In December 2006, Richardson announced that he would support a ban on cockfighting in New Mexico which became law on March 12, 2007. Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands are now the only parts of the United States where cockfighting is legal.

During New Mexico&#x27;s 2007 legislative session, Richardson signed a bill into law that made New Mexico the 12th state to legalize cannabis for medical reasons. When asked if this would hurt him in a presidential election, he stated that it did not matter, as it was &quot;the right thing to do&quot;.

During 2008 and 2009, Richardson faced &quot;possible legal issues&quot; while a federal grand jury investigated pay-to-play allegations in the awarding of a lucrative state contract to a company that gave campaign contributions to Richardson&#x27;s political action committee, Moving America Forward. The company in question, CDR, was alleged to have funneled more than $100,000 in donations to Richardson&#x27;s PAC in exchange for state construction projects. Richardson said when he withdrew his Commerce Secretary nomination that he was innocent; his popularity then slipped below 50% in his home state. In August 2009, federal prosecutors dropped the pending investigation against the governor, and there was speculation in the media about Richardson&#x27;s career after his second term as New Mexico governor concluded.

On March 18, 2009, he signed a bill repealing the death penalty, making New Mexico the second U.S. state, after New Jersey, to repeal the death penalty by legislative means since the 1960s. Richardson was subsequently honored with the 2009 Human Rights Award by Death Penalty Focus.

In its April 2010 report, ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington named Richardson one of the 11 worst governors in the United States because of various ethics issues throughout Richardson&#x27;s term as governor. The group accused Richardson of allowing political allies to benefit from firms connected to state investments, rewarding close associates with state positions or benefits (including providing a longtime friend and political supporter with a costly state contract), and allowing pay-to-play activity in his administration. They also opined that he fell short on efforts to make state government more transparent.

In December 2010, while still serving as governor, Richardson returned to North Korea in an unofficial capacity at the invitation of the North&#x27;s chief nuclear negotiator Kim Kye-gwan. Upon arriving in Pyongyang on December 16, Richardson told reporters that his &quot;objective is to see if we can reduce the tension on the Korean peninsula, that is my objective. I am going to have a whole series of talks with North Korean officials here and I look forward to my discussions&quot;, he said. On December 19, Richardson said his talks with North Korean officials made &quot;some progress&quot; in trying to resolve what he calls a &quot;very tense&quot; situation. Speaking from Pyongyang, Richardson told U.S. television network CNN that a North Korean general he met was receptive to his proposal for setting up a hotline between North and South Korean forces, and also was open to his idea for a military commission to monitor disputes in and around the Yellow Sea.

After his return from North Korea, Richardson dealt with the issue of a pardon for William H. Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, for killing Sheriff William J. Brady of Lincoln County, New Mexico, some 130 years before. Following up on the promise of a pardon at the time by then-territorial governor Lew Wallace, Richardson said he could not pardon Bonney posthumously because he did not want to second-guess his predecessor&#x27;s decision. &quot;It was a very close call&quot;, Richardson said. &quot;The romanticism appealed to me to issue a pardon, but the facts and the evidence did not support it.&quot;

Richardson&#x27;s second term in office ended in 2011 and he was term-limited from further terms as governor.

==2008 presidential campaign==

Richardson was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2008 presidential election but dropped out on January 10, 2008, after lackluster showings in the first primary and caucus contests. Despite his long history and friendship with the Clinton family, Richardson endorsed Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination on March 21, 2008, over Hillary Clinton. Commentator and Clinton ally James Carville compared Richardson to Judas Iscariot for the move. Richardson responded in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, feeling &quot;compelled to defend [himself] against character assassination and baseless allegations.&quot;

Richardson was a rumored vice presidential candidate for Democratic presumptive nominee Barack Obama, and was fully vetted by the Obama campaign, before Obama chose Joe Biden on August 23, 2008.

==Secretary of Commerce nomination==

Following Barack Obama&#x27;s victory in the 2008 presidential election, Richardson&#x27;s name was frequently mentioned as a possible Cabinet appointment in the incoming Obama administration. Most of this speculation surrounded the position of Secretary of State, given Richardson&#x27;s background as a diplomat. Richardson did not publicly comment on the speculation. Ultimately, Hillary Clinton was Obama&#x27;s nominee for Secretary of State.

Richardson was also considered for the position of Commerce Secretary. On December 3, 2008, Obama tapped Richardson for the post. On January 4, 2009, Richardson withdrew his name as Commerce Secretary nominee because of the federal grand jury investigation into pay-to-play allegations. &quot;The New York Times&quot; had reported in late December that the grand jury investigation issue would be raised at Richardson&#x27;s confirmation hearings. Later, in August 2009, Justice Department officials decided not to seek indictments.

==Allegations of corruption==
According to his autobiography, while serving as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson was asked by the White House in 1997 to interview Monica Lewinsky for a job on his staff. Richardson did so, and later offered her a position which she declined. 
&quot;The American Spectator&quot; alleged that Richardson knew more about the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal than he declared to the grand jury.

In 2011, Richardson was under investigation for his role in alleged campaign finance violations. A former member of Richardson&#x27;s campaign claimed that during Richardson&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign, Richardson and members of his campaign paid an unknown woman $250,000 to keep her from exposing an alleged affair they had in 2004.

During the 2012 trial &quot;United States of America v. Carollo, Goldberg and Grimm&quot;, the former CDR employee Doug Goldberg testified that he was involved in giving Bill Richardson campaign contributions amounting to $100,000 in exchange for his company CDR being hired to handle a $400 million swap deal for the New Mexico state government. During his testimony, Doug Goldberg stated that he had been given an envelope containing a check for $25,000 payable to Moving America Forward, Bill Richardson&#x27;s political action committee, by his boss Stewart Wolmark and told to deliver it to Bill Richardson at a fund raiser. When Goldberg handed the envelope to Richardson, he allegedly told Goldberg to &quot;Tell the big guy [Stewart Wolmark] I&#x27;m going to hire you guys&quot;. Goldberg went on to testify that CDR was hired but that he later learned that another firm was hired by Richardson to perform the actual work required and that Stewart Wolmark had given Richardson a further $75,000 in contributions.

In 2019 it was revealed that Richardson was among those named in court documents from a civil suit between Virginia Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The documents were unsealed on August 9, 2019, a day before Epstein&#x27;s death. Giuffre alleges that she was sexually trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell to several high-profile individuals, including Richardson, while she was underage in the early 2000s. Court documents from 2015 that were unsealed in 2019 alleged Richardson&#x27;s possible involvement with the Jeffrey Epstein child trafficking ring, which allegations he denied. A spokesperson for Richardson also denied the claims, stating that he did not know Giuffre and had never seen Epstein in the presence of young or underage girls. Richardson released a statement in August 2019, saying he had offered his assistance in the investigation of Epstein to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Richardson&#x27;s attorney, Jeff Brown of Dechert LLP, later said that he was informed by the assistant US attorney that Richardson is neither a target, subject, nor witness in the case and that there is no allegation against Richardson that the government is actively investigating.

==Private diplomacy==
Richardson visited North Korea several times and was involved in negotiations with the leadership there since the early 1990s. In 1996, he accompanied U.S. State Department officials and successfully negotiated the release of Evan Hunziker, the first American civilian to be arrested by North Korea on espionage charges since the end of the Korean War.

In 2011, he was again appointed as special envoy of the Organization of American States. Richardson formed a foundation, the Richardson Center, to help negotiate the release of political prisoners globally.

In January 2013, he led a delegation to North Korea of business leaders, including Google chair Eric Schmidt shortly after the state launched an orbital rocket. Richardson called the trip a &quot;private, humanitarian&quot; mission by U.S. citizens. He tried unsuccessfully to speak to North Korean officials about the detention of Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen accused of committing &quot;hostile&quot; acts against the state and sought to visit him but was only able to deliver to authorities a letter from Bae&#x27;s son. (Bae was released in November 2014.)

In March 2016, at the request of Ohio Governor John Kasich, Richardson unsuccessfully negotiated for the release of Cincinnati college student Otto Warmbier, who had been detained on a visit to North Korea. Warmbier was eventually released in a vegetative state in June 2017 and died in Cincinnati later that same month.

In November 2021, Richardson undertook a mission to Myanmar, where he negotiated with military junta head Min Aung Hlaing and secured the release of U.S. journalist Danny Fenster from an 11-year prison sentence.

Shortly before his death, Richardson was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize by four Democratic senators for his role in hostage diplomacy seeking the release of 15 political prisoners, including professional basketball player Brittney Griner and former U.S. Marine Trevor Reed.

== Post–gubernatorial career ==
In 2011, Richardson joined the boards of APCO Worldwide company Global Political Strategies as chairman, the World Resources Institute, the National Council for Science and the Environment, and Abengoa (international advisory board).

In 2012, Richardson joined the advisory board of Grow Energy and Refugees International. He was a member of Washington, D.C.–based Western Hemisphere think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.

In December 2012, Richardson became chairman of the Board of Directors of Car Charging Group, the largest independent owner and operator of public electric vehicle charging stations in the United States. In 2013 Richardson joined the Board of Advisors for the Fuel Freedom Foundation.

== Death ==
Richardson died at his summer house in Chatham, Massachusetts, on September 1, 2023, at age 75.

<text>Robert Renfroe Riley (born October 3, 1944) is an American retired politician and businessman who served as the 52nd governor of Alabama from 2003 to 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he was the U.S. representative for Alabama&#x27;s 3rd congressional district from 1997 to 2003.

==Early life, education and early career==
Riley was born in Ashland, Alabama, a small town in Clay County where his family ranched and farmed for six generations. Riley attended the University of Alabama, where he was a brother of Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity and graduated with a degree in business administration. Prior to being elected to the U.S. House in 1996, Riley had led a number of businesses. He owned a car dealership and trucking company, and had also been a cattleman and commercial and residential realtor.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Riley was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996, defeating his Democratic opponent, State Senator T.D. &quot;Ted&quot; Little (Auburn) and Libertarian John Sophocleus. It was his first run for elected office. He won by just over 6,000 votes to become only the second Republican to represent Alabama&#x27;s 3rd district since Reconstruction. The first was Glenn Andrews, who held it from 1965 to 1967, when it was numbered as the 4th District.

Riley was reelected in 1998 with somewhat less difficulty, taking 58% of the vote over Democrat Joe Turnham. In 2000, he only faced a Libertarian candidate.

==Governor of Alabama==

===2002 election===
Riley did not run for re-election to the House in November 2002 (as a supporter of term limits, he imposed a three-term limit on himself), instead running for governor of Alabama and defeating the Democratic incumbent Don Siegelman by approximately 3,000 votes - the narrowest margin in the state&#x27;s history for a gubernatorial race. The result was controversial, as the initial election night count showed a 2,000-plus vote victory for Siegelman.



===First term===
====Approval ratings====
On May 10, 2005, Riley&#x27;s approval ratings were 36% approving and 52% disapproving of his job as governor. By September 20, 2005, Riley&#x27;s approval ratings had increased substantially to 58% approving and 38% disapproving. Analysis of this increase seems to indicate that it may be attributed to the public&#x27;s perception of Riley&#x27;s response to Hurricane Katrina. By February 14, 2006, Riley&#x27;s approval ratings had slightly decreased, with 52% approving and 43% disapproving of his job as governor. By August 2006, his approval rating was at 62% with a disapproval rating of 35%.

====Supreme Court====
In 2003, Alabama state politics gained national attention when the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Roy Moore, refused to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the rotunda of the court building. Riley reportedly supported Moore, but ultimately did not play a large role in the dispute. Riley stated there was nothing he could do to prevent Moore from being removed from office by a judicial ethics panel. Moore challenged Riley in the June 6, 2006, GOP primary.

====Property taxes====
Property tax appraisals became a major campaign issue with Riley&#x27;s opponents claiming that Riley, acting through his revenue commissioner, ordered that property tax appraisals be made annually, rather than the quadrennial reappraisals that were established practice. Because property values tend to increase over time, making appraisals more frequent has the indirect effect of increasing the taxes paid by property owners. Riley&#x27;s opponents claimed that by doing so, he raised taxes without a vote of either the Legislature or the people. Riley claims he is merely following the language of the law, and the advice of his attorneys.

====Amendment One====
In the first year of his administration, Riley proposed &quot;Amendment One&quot;, which would have made swift changes to the state&#x27;s tax system. The plan essentially consisted of income tax breaks for lower brackets, offset by various tax hikes on consumption, property and income from higher brackets. Part of the problem that this plan sought to address was the strong dependence the Alabama tax system placed upon sales tax, which makes the state budget dependent upon the economy in the state. The plan was estimated to yield an overall state revenue increase of $1.2 billion per year. The plan also included accountability reforms, including changes to teacher tenure policies, accountability for school systems, and bans on pass-through pork. This plan also included provisions for a scholarship program for Alabama students to attend college and funding of other education initiatives.

Both support and opposition to this plan came from traditionally opposing forces in Alabama, crossing party lines. This included support from pro-business organizations, including the Business Council of Alabama and many Chambers of Commerce, as well as prominent education organizations, including the Alabama Education Association. Other progressively-minded non-profit groups supported this plan, including many organizations that had sought changes in the Alabama tax system for many years. These organizations saw this as an opportunity for Alabama to invest in the future of the state through investments in education and governmental reforms. Riley also presented this plan using Christian terms, building upon language already present in the state to argue that the Alabama tax system placed the heaviest burden upon the poorest citizens of the state. Opponents to the plan included the Alabama chapter of the Christian Coalition (splitting with the national Christian Coalition who endorsed the plan), and the Alabama Farmers Federation (ALFA). A number of those who opposed this plan, including both organizations mentioned, had strongly supported Riley for governor in 2002. These opponents based a campaign upon a criticism of the state legislature and used the complexity of the plans to claim that taxes would go up on people in the state. While proponents had pointed to studies of the plan showing the majority of Alabamians seeing a lower overall tax burden, polls indicated that most citizens - likely influenced by the proposed property tax increase - believed their personal taxes would be higher under the plan.

Amendment One was rejected by voters on September 9, 2003, with 68% opposed. While Riley&#x27;s Amendment One was soundly rejected by Alabama voters, it did gain him national recognition. For his leadership in addressing the state&#x27;s fiscal crisis, Governor Riley was named the &quot;Public Official of the Year&quot; by &quot;Governing&quot; magazine in 2003, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine hailed him for being one of the nation&#x27;s &quot;most courageous politicians&quot;.

The overwhelming rejection of this plan forced Riley to mend fences within his own base and seek to do some reforms without the broad tax increases that Amendment One sought. Some parts of the proposal have been enacted, such as efforts to raise the minimum tax threshold in Alabama.

====Industrial development====
Riley has claimed credit for helping to spur economic development in Alabama. Riley points to the opening of an aeronautics engineering facility in Mobile by EADS, the parent company of Airbus, which may ripen into an aircraft assembly plant if EADS secures future contracts. Riley&#x27;s critics have pointed out that Riley has failed to emulate the success of predecessors, such as Siegelmanduring whose administration the Hyundai plant was successfully recruitedand Jim Folsom, Jr., in securing automotive manufacturing plants. Specifically, when Kia announced in March 2006 it would build a maunfucturing plant in Georgia, Riley was criticized by Siegelman, for Alabama&#x27;s failure to mount a serious bid for the plant.

Under Riley&#x27;s administration, unemployment in Alabama fell from 5.3% in January 2003 when Riley took office to 3.3% in March 2006. This rate was the lowest ever recorded since statistics began being tracked in 1976 and was among the nations lowest.

====Hurricanes====
In 2005, Governor Riley was criticized by some Mobile County residents after issuing that area of the state a &quot;mandatory&quot; evacuation order in advance of Hurricane Dennis&#x27; landfall. Residents felt the issue was better addressed during Hurricane Katrina using a layered approach with sections of the county evacuated instead of the entire county.

On August 28, 2005, Governor Riley declared a state of emergency for the approaching Hurricane Katrina. On the same day, he requested president George W. Bush to declare &quot;expedited major disaster declaration&quot; for six counties of south Alabama, which was approved by the evening of August 29. 350 national guardsmen were called on duty as of August 30.

;Aruba local government
On November 9, 2005, Riley called for a citizens&#x27; boycott of Aruba, alleging that the local government was engaged in a cover-up of the disappearance of Alabama native Natalee Holloway.

====Abramoff scandal====
In November 2005, Riley was linked to the Jack Abramoff scandal when his former Congressional press secretary, Michael Scanlon, pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the matter. It further emerged that, as a Congressman, Riley signed a letter on behalf of the U.S. Family Network, opposing expansion of casino gambling in Alabama. The U.S. Family Network was revealed to be an Abramoff front, funded by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, which operated competing casinos. Riley has denied knowing the source of this funding.

===2006 election===

Riley defeated Democratic Lieutenant Governor Lucy Baxley easily as his approval ratings made a comeback.


===Second term===
====Economy====

In April 2007, the unemployment rate once again reached 3.3%. However, recent labor statistics provided by the Alabama Department of Industrial Relations indicate that under Governor Riley, Alabama&#x27;s unemployment nearly tripled to a seasonally adjusted rate of 8.4% in February 2009. The rates for seasonally adjusted and unadjusted range from 7.8–8.9% for January and February 2009.

Under Governor Riley, Alabama&#x27;s unemployment has continued to climb, and Alabama Department of Industrial Relations Director Tom Surtees issued a press release dated June 19, 2009, which indicated that Alabama&#x27;s unemployment rate for May rose to 9.8%, an increase from April&#x27;s rate of 9.0%, and is Alabama&#x27;s highest unemployment rate in 25 years.

Critics have claimed that recent developments are a consequence of national economic recovery and pointed to the loss of thousands of Alabama&#x27;s historic textile jobs under Riley. Nevertheless, the state under Riley&#x27;s administration was recognized as &quot;State of the Year&quot; by &quot;Southern Business and Development&quot; magazine four years in a row and received other awards for competitiveness, job creation and economic development.

Among other honors, &quot;Worldwide Interactive Network&quot; named the Alabama Office of Workforce Development the No. 1 U.S. employee development agency and &quot;Expansion Management&quot; magazine has ranked Alabama Industrial Development Training No. 1 among workforce training programs. Riley&#x27;s Alabama Bureau of Tourism &amp; Travel received the National Council of State Tourism Directors&#x27; annual Mercury Award recognizing its &quot;Year of Alabama Food&quot; as the nation&#x27;s top tourism campaign.

In May 2007, Riley announced that ThyssenKrupp would build a $4.2 billion state-of-the-art steel mill north of Mobile, Alabama, the largest economic announcement in Alabama&#x27;s history, and largest corporate project in U.S. history. The mill, now in operation, employs 2,700 workers

====Transparency====
As part of his plan to provide open government, Riley has posted on the Governor&#x27;s website the monthly expenditures from the Governor&#x27;s Contingency Fund and the quarterly flight logs from all state airplanes.

====Death penalty====
As governor, Riley oversaw 25 executions in Alabama, more than any of his predecessors since 1983 (see Capital punishment in Alabama).

==== Apology for slavery ====
In 2007, Riley signed a resolution passed by the legislature apologizing for slavery in the state.

== 2012 presidential speculation ==
An editorial by &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and separate piece in the paper on August 13, 2009, in what was deemed to be an open endorsement of Bob Riley as a potential 2012 presidential candidate instantly threw the governor&#x27;s name into the political field of possible nominees as state and national media jumped on the story. Governor Riley during an interview the same day denied he was considering a future presidential run. On February 2, 2011, both the &quot;Birmingham News&quot; and the &quot;Decatur Daily&quot; also ran stories speculating that Riley was considering running for president. In the end, Riley did not run.

==Personal life==
Riley is married to the former Patsy Adams, also from Clay County. The Rileys have four children, Rob, Jenice, Minda and Krisalyn. Jenice, the Rileys&#x27; first daughter and the campaign&#x27;s fundraiser, died in August 2001. The Rileys have three granddaughters and three grandsons. He is an alumni brother of Phi Kappa Sigma.

On June 26, 2011, Riley was on a cross-country trip on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle when he crashed on the Dalton Highway in Alaska and sustained serious injuries.

<doc id="375380" wikidata="Q1194916" url="?curid=375380" title="Mereology">
<text>Mereology (; from Greek μέρος &#x27;part&#x27; (root: μερε-, &quot;mere-&quot;) and the suffix &quot;-logy&quot;, &#x27;study, discussion, science&#x27;) is the philosophical study of part-whole relationships, also called &quot;parthood relationships&quot;. As a branch of metaphysics, mereology examines the connections between parts and their wholes, exploring how components interact within a system. This theory has roots in ancient philosophy, with significant contributions from Plato, Aristotle, and later, medieval and Renaissance thinkers like Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus. Mereology was formally axiomatized in the 20th century by Polish logician Stanisław Leśniewski, who introduced it as part of a comprehensive framework for logic and mathematics, and coined the word &quot;mereology&quot;.

Mereological ideas were influential in early , and formal mereology has continued to be used by a minority in works on the . Different axiomatizations of mereology have been applied in , used in to analyze &quot;mass terms&quot;, used in the cognitive sciences, and developed in . Mereology has been combined with topology, for more on which see the article on mereotopology. Mereology is also used in the foundation of Whitehead&#x27;s point-free geometry, on which see Tarski 1956 and Gerla 1995. Mereology is used in discussions of entities as varied as musical groups, geographical regions, and abstract concepts, demonstrating its applicability to a wide range of philosophical and scientific discourses.

In metaphysics, mereology is used to formulate the thesis of &quot;composition as identity&quot;, the theory that individuals or objects are identical to &quot;mereological sums&quot; (also called &quot;fusions&quot;) of their parts. A metaphysical thesis called &quot;mereological monism&quot; suggests that the version of mereology developed by Stanisław Leśniewski and Nelson Goodman (commonly called &quot;Classical Extensional Mereology&quot;, or CEM) serves as the general and exhaustive theory of parthood and composition, at least for a large and significant domain of things. This thesis is controversial, since parthood may not seem to be a transitive relation (as claimed by CEM) in some cases, such as the parthood between organisms and their organs. Nevertheless, CEM&#x27;s assumptions are very common in mereological frameworks, due largely to Leśniewski influence as the one to first coin the word and formalize the theory: mereological theories commonly assume that everything is a part of itself (reflexivity), that a part of a part of a whole is itself a part of that whole (transitivity), and that two distinct entities cannot each be a part of the other (antisymmetry), so that the parthood relation is a partial order. An alternative is to assume instead that parthood is irreflexive (nothing is ever a part of itself) but still transitive, in which case antisymmetry follows automatically.

==History==
Informal part-whole reasoning was consciously invoked in metaphysics and ontology from Plato (in particular, in the second half of the &quot;Parmenides&quot;) and Aristotle onwards, and more or less unwittingly in 19th-century mathematics until the triumph of set theory around 1910. Metaphysical ideas of this era that discuss the concepts of parts and wholes include divine simplicity and the classical conception of beauty.

Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2001) sheds much light on part-whole reasoning during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and reviews how Cantor and Peano devised set theory. It appears that the first to reason consciously and at length about parts and wholes was Edmund Husserl, in 1901, in the second volume of &quot;Logical Investigations&quot; – Third Investigation: &quot;On the Theory of Wholes and Parts&quot; (Husserl 1970 is the English translation). However, the word &quot;mereology&quot; is absent from his writings, and he employed no symbolism even though his doctorate was in mathematics.

Stanisław Leśniewski coined &quot;mereology&quot; in 1927, from the Greek word μέρος (&quot;méros&quot;, &quot;part&quot;), to refer to a formal theory of part-whole he devised in a series of highly technical papers published between 1916 and 1931, and translated in Leśniewski (1992). Leśniewski&#x27;s student Alfred Tarski, in his Appendix E to Woodger (1937) and the paper translated as Tarski (1984), greatly simplified Leśniewski&#x27;s formalism. Other students (and students of students) of Leśniewski elaborated this &quot;Polish mereology&quot; over the course of the 20th century. For a good selection of the literature on Polish mereology, see Srzednicki and Rickey (1984). For a survey of Polish mereology, see Simons (1987). Since 1980 or so, however, research on Polish mereology has been almost entirely historical in nature.

A. N. Whitehead planned a fourth volume of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, on geometry, but never wrote it. His 1914 correspondence with Bertrand Russell reveals that his intended approach to geometry can be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, as mereological in essence. This work culminated in Whitehead (1916) and the mereological systems of Whitehead (1919, 1920).

In 1930, Henry S. Leonard completed a Harvard PhD dissertation in philosophy, setting out a formal theory of the part-whole relation. This evolved into the &quot;calculus of individuals&quot; of Goodman and Leonard (1940). Goodman revised and elaborated this calculus in the three editions of Goodman (1951). The calculus of individuals is the starting point for the post-1970 revival of mereology among logicians, ontologists, and computer scientists, a revival well-surveyed in Simons (1987), Casati and Varzi (1999), and Cotnoir and Varzi (2021).

==Axioms and primitive notions==

A basic choice in defining a mereological system, is whether to allow things to be considered parts of themselves (reflexivity of parthood). In naive set theory a similar question arises: whether a set is to be considered a &quot;member&quot; of itself. In both cases, &quot;yes&quot; gives rise to paradoxes analogous to Russell&#x27;s paradox: Let there be an object O such that every object that is not a proper part of itself is a proper part of O. Is O a proper part of itself? No, because no object is a proper part of itself; and yes, because it meets the specified requirement for inclusion as a proper part of O. In set theory, a set is often termed an &quot;improper&quot; subset of itself. Given such paradoxes, mereology requires an axiomatic formulation.

A mereological &quot;system&quot; is a first-order theory (with identity) whose universe of discourse consists of wholes and their respective parts, collectively called &quot;objects&quot;. Mereology is a collection of nested and non-nested axiomatic systems, not unlike the case with modal logic.

The treatment, terminology, and hierarchical organization below follow Casati and Varzi (1999: Ch. 3) closely. For a more recent treatment, correcting certain misconceptions, see Hovda (2008). Lower-case letters denote variables ranging over objects. Following each symbolic axiom or definition is the number of the corresponding formula in Casati and Varzi, written in bold.

A mereological system requires at least one primitive binary relation (dyadic predicate). The most conventional choice for such a relation is parthood (also called &quot;inclusion&quot;), &quot;&quot;x&quot; is a &quot;part&quot; of &quot;y&quot;&quot;, written &quot;Pxy&quot;. Nearly all systems require that parthood partially order the universe. The following defined relations, required for the axioms below, follow immediately from parthood alone:
*An immediate defined predicate is &quot;x is a proper part of &quot;y&quot;&quot;, written &quot;PPxy&quot;, which holds (i.e., is satisfied, comes out true) if &quot;Pxy&quot; is true and &quot;Pyx&quot; is false. Compared to parthood (which is a partial order), ProperPart is a strict partial order.
:formula_1 3.3
:An object lacking proper parts is an &quot;atom&quot;. The mereological universe consists of all objects we wish to think about, and all of their proper parts:
*Overlap: &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; overlap, written &quot;Oxy&quot;, if there exists an object &quot;z&quot; such that &quot;Pzx&quot; and &quot;Pzy&quot; both hold.
:formula_2 3.1
:The parts of &quot;z&quot;, the &quot;overlap&quot; or &quot;product&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, are precisely those objects that are parts of both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.
*Underlap: &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; underlap, written &quot;Uxy&quot;, if there exists an object &quot;z&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are both parts of &quot;z&quot;.
:formula_3 3.2
Overlap and Underlap are reflexive, symmetric, and intransitive.

Systems vary in what relations they take as primitive and as defined. For example, in extensional mereologies (defined below), &quot;parthood&quot; can be defined from Overlap as follows:
:formula_4 3.31

The axioms are:
*Parthood partially orders the universe:
:M1, Reflexive: An object is a part of itself.
:formula_5 P.1
:M2, Antisymmetric: If &quot;Pxy&quot; and &quot;Pyx&quot; both hold, then &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are the same object.
:formula_6 P.2
:M3, Transitive: If &quot;Pxy&quot; and &quot;Pyz&quot;, then &quot;Pxz&quot;.
:formula_7 P.3
*M4, Weak Supplementation: If &quot;PPxy&quot; holds, there exists a &quot;z&quot; such that &quot;Pzy&quot; holds but &quot;Ozx&quot; does not.
:formula_8 P.4

*M5, Strong Supplementation: If &quot;Pyx&quot; does not hold, there exists a &quot;z&quot; such that &quot;Pzy&quot; holds but &quot;Ozx&quot; does not.
:formula_9 P.5

*M5&#x27;, Atomistic Supplementation: If &quot;Pxy&quot; does not hold, then there exists an atom &quot;z&quot; such that &quot;Pzx&quot; holds but &quot;Ozy&quot; does not.
:formula_10 P.5&#x27; 

*Top: There exists a &quot;universal object&quot;, designated &quot;W&quot;, such that &quot;PxW&quot; holds for any &quot;x&quot;.
:formula_11 3.20
:Top is a theorem if M8 holds.

*Bottom: There exists an atomic &quot;null object&quot;, designated &quot;N&quot;, such that &quot;PNx&quot; holds for any &quot;x&quot;.
:formula_12 3.22

*M6, Sum: If &quot;Uxy&quot; holds, there exists a &quot;z&quot;, called the &quot;sum&quot; or &quot;fusion&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, such that the objects overlapping of &quot;z&quot; are just those objects that overlap either &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot;.
:formula_13 P.6
*M7, Product: If &quot;Oxy&quot; holds, there exists a &quot;z&quot;, called the &quot;product&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, such that the parts of &quot;z&quot; are just those objects that are parts of both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.
:formula_14 P.7
:If &quot;Oxy&quot; does not hold, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; have no parts in common, and the product of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is undefined.
*M8, Unrestricted Fusion: Let φ(&quot;x&quot;) be a first-order formula in which &quot;x&quot; is a free variable. Then the fusion of all objects satisfying φ exists.
:formula_15 P.8
:M8 is also called &quot;General Sum Principle&quot;, &quot;Unrestricted Mereological Composition&quot;, or &quot;Universalism&quot;. M8 corresponds to the principle of unrestricted comprehension of naive set theory, which gives rise to Russell&#x27;s paradox. There is no mereological counterpart to this paradox simply because &quot;parthood&quot;, unlike set membership, is reflexive.

*M8&#x27;, Unique Fusion: The fusions whose existence M8 asserts are also unique. P.8&#x27; 
*M9, Atomicity: All objects are either atoms or fusions of atoms.
:formula_16 P.10

==Various systems==
Simons (1987), Casati and Varzi (1999) and Hovda (2008) describe many mereological systems whose axioms are taken from the above list. We adopt the boldface nomenclature of Casati and Varzi. The best-known such system is the one called &quot;classical extensional mereology&quot;, hereinafter abbreviated CEM (other abbreviations are explained below). In CEM, P.1 through P.8&#x27; hold as axioms or are theorems. M9, &quot;Top&quot;, and &quot;Bottom&quot; are optional.

The systems in the table below are partially ordered by inclusion, in the sense that, if all the theorems of system A are also theorems of system B, but the converse is not necessarily true, then B &quot;includes&quot; A. The resulting Hasse diagram is similar to Fig. 3.2 in Casati and Varzi (1999: 48).

There are two equivalent ways of asserting that the universe is partially ordered: Assume either M1-M3, or that Proper Parthood is transitive and asymmetric, hence a strict partial order. Either axiomatization results in the system M. M2 rules out closed loops formed using Parthood, so that the part relation is well-founded. Sets are well-founded if the axiom of regularity is assumed. The literature contains occasional philosophical and common-sense objections to the transitivity of Parthood.

M4 and M5 are two ways of asserting supplementation, the mereological analog of set complementation, with M5 being stronger because M4 is derivable from M5. M and M4 yield &quot;minimal&quot; mereology, MM. Reformulated in terms of Proper Part, MM is Simons&#x27;s (1987) preferred minimal system.

In any system in which M5 or M5&#x27; are assumed or can be derived, then it can be proved that two objects having the same proper parts are identical. This property is known as &quot;Extensionality&quot;, a term borrowed from set theory, for which extensionality is the defining axiom. Mereological systems in which Extensionality holds are termed &quot;extensional&quot;, a fact denoted by including the letter E in their symbolic names.

M6 asserts that any two underlapping objects have a unique sum; M7 asserts that any two overlapping objects have a unique product. If the universe is finite or if &quot;Top&quot; is assumed, then the universe is closed under &quot;Sum&quot;. Universal closure of &quot;Product&quot; and of supplementation relative to &quot;W&quot; requires &quot;Bottom&quot;. &quot;W&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are, evidently, the mereological analog of the universal and empty sets, and &quot;Sum&quot; and &quot;Product&quot; are, likewise, the analogs of set-theoretical union and intersection. If M6 and M7 are either assumed or derivable, the result is a mereology with closure.

Because &quot;Sum&quot; and &quot;Product&quot; are binary operations, M6 and M7 admit the sum and product of only a finite number of objects. The &quot;Unrestricted Fusion&quot; axiom, M8, enables taking the sum of infinitely many objects. The same holds for &quot;Product&quot;, when defined. At this point, mereology often invokes set theory, but any recourse to set theory is eliminable by replacing a formula with a quantified variable ranging over a universe of sets by a schematic formula with one free variable. The formula comes out true (is satisfied) whenever the name of an object that would be a member of the set (if it existed) replaces the free variable. Hence any axiom with sets can be replaced by an axiom schema with monadic atomic subformulae. M8 and M8&#x27; are schemas of just this sort. The syntax of a first-order theory can describe only a denumerable number of sets; hence, only denumerably many sets may be eliminated in this fashion, but this limitation is not binding for the sort of mathematics contemplated here.

If M8 holds, then &quot;W&quot; exists for infinite universes. Hence, &quot;Top&quot; need be assumed only if the universe is infinite and M8 does not hold. &quot;Top&quot; (postulating &quot;W&quot;) is not controversial, but &quot;Bottom&quot; (postulating &quot;N&quot;) is. Leśniewski rejected &quot;Bottom&quot;, and most mereological systems follow his example (an exception is the work of Richard Milton Martin). Hence, while the universe is closed under sum, the product of objects that do not overlap is typically undefined. A system with &quot;W&quot; but not &quot;N&quot; is isomorphic to:
* a Boolean algebra lacking a 0;
* a join semilattice bounded from above by 1. Binary fusion and &quot;W&quot; interpret join and 1, respectively.
Postulating &quot;N&quot; renders all possible products definable, but also transforms classical extensional mereology into a set-free model of Boolean algebra.

If sets are admitted, M8 asserts the existence of the fusion of all members of any nonempty set. Any mereological system in which M8 holds is called &quot;general&quot;, and its name includes G. In any general mereology, M6 and M7 are provable. Adding M8 to an extensional mereology results in &quot;general extensional mereology&quot;, abbreviated GEM; moreover, the extensionality renders the fusion unique. On the converse, however, if the fusion asserted by M8 is assumed unique, so that M8&#x27; replaces M8, then—as Tarski (1929) had shown—M3 and M8&#x27; suffice to axiomatize GEM, a remarkably economical result. Simons (1987: 38–41) lists a number of GEM theorems.

M2 and a finite universe necessarily imply &quot;Atomicity&quot;, namely that everything either is an atom or includes atoms among its proper parts. If the universe is infinite, &quot;Atomicity&quot; requires M9. Adding M9 to any mereological system, X results in the atomistic variant thereof, denoted AX. &quot;Atomicity&quot; permits economies, for instance, assuming that M5&#x27; implies &quot;Atomicity&quot; and extensionality, and yields an alternative axiomatization of AGEM.

==Set theory==
From the beginnings of set theory, there has been a dispute between conceiving of sets &quot;mereologically&quot;, where a set is the mereological sum of its elements, and conceiving of sets &quot;collectively&quot;, where a set is something &quot;over and above&quot; its elements. The latter conception is now dominant, but some of the earliest set theorists adhered to the mereological conception: Richard Dedekind, in &quot;Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?&quot; (1888), avoided the empty set and used the same symbol for set membership and set inclusion, which are two signs that he conceived of sets mereologically. Similarly, Ernst Schröder, in &quot;Vorlesungen über die Algebra der Logik&quot; (1890), also used the mereological conception. It was Gottlob Frege, in a 1895 review of Schröder&#x27;s work, who first laid out the difference between collections and mereological sums. The fact that Ernst Zermelo adopted the collective conception when he wrote his influential 1908 axiomatization of set theory is certainly significant for, though it does not fully explain, its current popularity.

In set theory, singletons are &quot;atoms&quot; that have no (non-empty) proper parts; set theory where sets cannot be built up from unit sets is a nonstandard type of set theory, called non-well-founded set theory. The calculus of individuals was thought to require that an object either have no proper parts, in which case it is an &quot;atom&quot;, or be the mereological sum of atoms. Eberle (1970), however, showed how to construct a calculus of individuals lacking &quot;atoms&quot;, i.e., one where every object has a &quot;&quot;, so that the universe is infinite.

A detailed comparison between mereology, set theory, and a semantic &quot;ensemble theory&quot; is presented in chapter 13 of Bunt (1985); when David Lewis wrote his famous &quot;&quot;, he found that &quot;its main thesis had been anticipated in&quot; Bunt&#x27;s ensemble theory.

=== &quot;Parts of Classes&quot; ===
Philosopher David Lewis, in his 1991 work &quot;Parts of Classes&quot;, axiomatized Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZFC) set theory using only classical mereology, plural quantification, and a primitive singleton-forming operator, governed by axioms that resemble the axioms for &quot;successor&quot; in Peano arithmetic. This contrasts with more usual axiomatizations of ZFC, which use only the primitive notion of membership. Lewis&#x27;s work is named after his thesis that a class&#x27;s subclasses are mereological parts of the class (in Lewis&#x27;s usage, this means that a set&#x27;s subsets, not counting the empty set, are parts of the set); this thesis has been disputed.

Michael Potter, a creator of Scott–Potter set theory, has criticized Lewis&#x27;s work for failing to make set theory any more easily comprehensible, since Lewis says of his primitive singleton operator that, given the necessity (perceived by Lewis) of avoiding philosophically motivated mathematical revisionism, &quot;I have to say, gritting my teeth, that somehow, I know not how, we do understand what it means to speak of singletons.&quot; Potter says Lewis &quot;could just as easily have said, gritting his teeth, that somehow, he knows not how, we do understand what it means to speak of membership, in which case there would have been no need for the rest of the book.&quot;

Forrest (2002) revised Lewis&#x27;s analysis by first formulating a generalization of CEM, called &quot;Heyting mereology&quot;, whose sole nonlogical primitive is &quot;Proper Part&quot;, assumed transitive and antireflexive. According to this theory, there exists a &quot;fictitious&quot; null individual that is a proper part of every individual; two schemas assert that every lattice join exists (lattices are complete) and that meet distributes over join. On this Heyting mereology, Forrest erects a theory of &quot;pseudosets&quot;, adequate for all purposes to which sets have been put.

== Foundations of mathematics ==
Mereology was influential in early conceptions of set theory (see ), which is currently thought of as a foundation for all mathematical theories. Even after the currently-dominant &quot;collective&quot; conception of sets became prevalent, mereology has sometimes been developed as an alternative foundation, especially by authors who were nominalists and therefore rejected abstract objects such as sets. The advantage of mereology for nominalists is that mereological sums, unlike collective sets, are thought to be nothing &quot;over and above&quot; their (possibly concrete) parts.

Mereology may still be valuable to non-nominalists: Eberle (1970) defended the &quot;ontological innocence&quot; of mereology, which is the idea that one can employ mereology regardless of one&#x27;s ontological stance regarding sets. This innocence results from mereology being formalizable in either of two equivalent ways: quantified variables ranging over a universe of sets, or schematic predicates with a single free variable.

Still, Stanisław Leśniewski and Nelson Goodman, who developed Classical Extensional Mereology, were nominalists, and consciously developed mereology as an alternative to set theory as a foundation of mathematics. Goodman defended the &quot;Principle of Nominalism&quot;, which states that whenever two entities have the same basic constituents, they are identical. Most mathematicians and philosophers have accepted set theory as a legitimate and valuable foundation for mathematics, effectively rejecting the Principle of Nominalism in favor of some other theory, such as mathematical platonism. David Lewis, whose &quot;&quot; attempted to reconstruct set theory using mereology, was also a nominalist.

Richard Milton Martin, who was also a nominalist, employed a version of the calculus of individuals throughout his career, starting in 1941. Goodman and Quine (1947) tried to develop the natural and real numbers using the calculus of individuals, but were mostly unsuccessful; Quine did not reprint that article in his &quot;Selected Logic Papers&quot;. In a series of chapters in the books he published in the last decade of his life, Richard Milton Martin set out to do what Goodman and Quine had abandoned 30 years prior. A recurring problem with attempts to ground mathematics in mereology is how to build up the theory of relations while abstaining from set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair. Martin argued that Eberle&#x27;s (1970) theory of relational individuals solved this problem.

Burgess and Rosen (1997) provide a survey of attempts to found mathematics without using set theory, such as using mereology.

==General systems theory==
In general systems theory, mereology refers to formal work on system decomposition and parts, wholes and boundaries (by, e.g., Mihajlo D. Mesarovic (1970), Gabriel Kron (1963), or Maurice Jessel (see Bowden (1989, 1998)). A hierarchical version of Gabriel Kron&#x27;s Network Tearing was published by Keith Bowden (1991), reflecting David Lewis&#x27;s ideas on gunk. Such ideas appear in theoretical computer science and physics, often in combination with sheaf theory, topos, or category theory. See also the work of Steve Vickers on (parts of) specifications in computer science, Joseph Goguen on physical systems, and Tom Etter (1996, 1998) on link theory and quantum mechanics.

==Linguistic semantics==
Bunt (1985), a study of the semantics of natural language, shows how mereology can help understand such phenomena as the mass–count distinction and verb aspect. But Nicolas (2008) argues that a different logical framework, called plural logic, should be used for that purpose.
Also, natural language often employs &quot;part of&quot; in ambiguous ways (Simons 1987 discusses this at length). Hence, it is unclear how, if at all, one can translate certain natural language expressions into mereological predicates. Steering clear of such difficulties may require limiting the interpretation of mereology to mathematics and natural science. Casati and Varzi (1999), for example, limit the scope of mereology to physical objects.

== Metaphysics ==
In metaphysics there are many troubling questions pertaining to parts and wholes. One question addresses constitution and persistence, another asks about composition.

=== Mereological constitution ===
In metaphysics, there are several puzzles concerning cases of mereological constitution, that is, what makes up a whole. There is still a concern with parts and wholes, but instead of looking at what parts make up a whole, the emphasis is on what a thing is made of, such as its materials, e.g., the bronze in a bronze statue. Below are two of the main puzzles that philosophers use to discuss constitution.

&quot;Ship of Theseus:&quot; Briefly, the puzzle goes something like this. There is a ship called the Ship of Theseus. Over time, the boards start to rot, so we remove the boards and place them in a pile. First question, is the ship made of the new boards the same as the ship that had all the old boards? Second, if we reconstruct a ship using all of the old planks, etc. from the Ship of Theseus, and we also have a ship that was built out of new boards (each added one-by-one over time to replace old decaying boards), which ship is the real Ship of Theseus?

&quot;Statue and Lump of Clay:&quot; Roughly, a sculptor decides to mold a statue out of a lump of clay. At time t1 the sculptor has a lump of clay. After many manipulations at time t2 there is a statue. The question asked is, is the lump of clay and the statue (numerically) identical? If so, how and why?

Constitution typically has implications for views on persistence: how does an object persist over time if any of its parts (materials) change or are removed, as is the case with humans who lose cells, change height, hair color, memories, and yet we are said to be the same person today as we were when we were first born. For example, Ted Sider is the same today as he was when he was born—he just changed. But how can this be if many parts of Ted today did not exist when Ted was just born? Is it possible for things, such as organisms to persist? And if so, how? There are several views that attempt to answer this question. Some of the views are as follows (note, there are several other views):

(a) Constitution view. This view accepts cohabitation. That is, two objects share exactly the same matter. Here, it follows, that there are no temporal parts.

(b) Mereological essentialism, which states that the only objects that exist are quantities of matter, which are things defined by their parts. The object persists if matter is removed (or the form changes); but the object ceases to exist if any matter is destroyed.

(c) Dominant Sorts. This is the view that tracing is determined by which sort is dominant; they reject cohabitation. For example, lump does not equal statue because they&#x27;re different &quot;sorts&quot;.

(d) Nihilism—which makes the claim that no objects exist, except simples, so there is no persistence problem.

(e) 4-dimensionalism or temporal parts (may also go by the names perdurantism or exdurantism), which roughly states that aggregates of temporal parts are intimately related. For example, two roads merging, momentarily and spatially, are still one road, because they share a part.

(f) 3-dimensionalism (may also go by the name endurantism), where the object is wholly present. That is, the persisting object retains numerical identity.

=== Mereological composition ===
One question that is addressed by philosophers is which is more fundamental: parts, wholes, or neither? Another pressing question is called the special composition question (SCQ): For any Xs, when is it the case that there is a Y such that the Xs compose Y? This question has caused philosophers to run in three different directions: nihilism, universal composition (UC), or a moderate view (restricted composition). The first two views are considered extreme since the first denies composition, and the second allows any and all non-spatially overlapping objects to compose another object. The moderate view encompasses several theories that try to make sense of SCQ without saying &#x27;no&#x27; to composition or &#x27;yes&#x27; to unrestricted composition.

==== Fundamentality ====
There are philosophers who are concerned with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Schaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Schaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Schaffer argues that the whole &quot;cosmos&quot; is more fundamental and everything else is a part of the cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes &quot;are just&quot; (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts—they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.

==== Special composition question ====
Philosophers want to know when some Xs compose something Y. There are several kinds of response:

*One response is &quot;nihilism&quot;. According to nihilism, there are no mereological complex objects (composite objects), only simples. Nihilists do not entirely reject composition because they think simples compose themselves, but this is a different point. More formally, nihilists would say: Necessarily, for any non-overlapping Xs, there is an object composed of the Xs if and only if there is only one of the Xs. This theory, though well explored, has its own problems: it seems to contradict experience and common sense, to be incompatible with atomless gunk, and to be unsupported by space-time physics.
*Another prominent response is &quot;universal composition&quot; (UC). According to UC, as long as Xs do not spatially overlap, they can compose a complex object. Universal compositionalists also support unrestricted composition. More formally: Necessarily, for any non-overlapping Xs, there is a Y such that Y is composed of the Xs. For example, someone&#x27;s left thumb, the top half of another person&#x27;s right shoe, and a quark in the center of their galaxy can compose a complex object. This theory also has some drawbacks, most notably that it allows for far too many objects.
*A third response (perhaps less explored than the other two) includes a range of &quot;restricted composition views&quot;. There are several views, but they all share an idea: that there is a restriction on what counts as a complex object: some (but not all) Xs come together to compose a complex Y. Some of these theories include:

(a) Contact—Xs compose a complex Y if and only if the Xs are in contact;

(b) Fastenation—Xs compose a complex Y if and only if the Xs are fastened;

(c) Cohesion—Xs compose a complex Y if and only if the Xs cohere (cannot be pulled apart or moved in relation to each other without breaking);

(d) Fusion—Xs compose a complex Y if and only if the Xs are fused (joined together such that there is no boundary);

(e) Organicism—Xs compose a complex Y if and only if either the activities of the Xs constitute a life or there is only one of the Xs; and

(f) Brutal Composition—&quot;It&#x27;s just the way things are.&quot; There is no true, nontrivial, and finitely long answer.

Many more hypotheses continue to be explored. A common problem with these theories is that they are vague. It remains unclear what &quot;fastened&quot; or &quot;life&quot; mean, for example. And there are other problems with the restricted composition responses, many of them which depend on which theory is being discussed.

* A fourth response is &quot;deflationism&quot;. According to deflationism, the way the term &quot;exist&quot; is used varies, and thus all the above answers to the SCQ can be correct when indexed to the appropriate meaning of &quot;exist&quot;. Further, there is no privileged way in which the term &quot;exist&quot; must be used. There is therefore no privileged answer to the SCQ, since there are no privileged conditions for when Xs compose Y. Instead, the debate is reduced to a mere verbal dispute rather than a genuine ontological debate. In this way, the SCQ is part of a larger debate in general ontological realism and anti-realism. While deflationism successfully avoids the SCQ, it comes at the cost of ontological anti-realism, such that nature has no objective reality, for, if there is no privileged way to objectively affirm the existence of objects, nature itself must have no objectivity.

<text>Donald Arthur Glaser (September 21, 1926 – February 28, 2013) was an American physicist, neurobiologist, and the winner of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the bubble chamber used in subatomic particle physics.

==Education==
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Glaser completed his Bachelor of Science degree in physics and mathematics from Case School of Applied Science in 1946. He completed his PhD in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1949. Glaser accepted a position as an instructor at the University of Michigan in 1949, and was promoted to professor in 1957. He joined the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley, in 1959, as a professor of physics. During this time his research concerned short-lived elementary particles. The bubble chamber enabled him to observe the paths and lifetimes of the particles.

Starting in 1962, Glaser changed his field of research to molecular biology, starting with a project on ultraviolet-induced cancer. In 1964, he was given the additional title of professor of molecular biology. Glaser&#x27;s position (since 1989) was professor of physics and neurobiology in the graduate school.

==Personal life==
Donald Glaser was born on September 21, 1926, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Russian Jewish immigrants, Lena and William J. Glaser, a businessman. He enjoyed music and played the piano, violin, and viola. He went to Cleveland Heights High School, where he became interested in physics as a means to understand the physical world. He died in his sleep at the age of 86 on February 28, 2013, in Berkeley, California.

==Education and early career==
Glaser attended Case School of Applied Science (now Case Western Reserve University), where he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics and mathematics in 1946. During the course of his education there, he became especially interested in particle physics. He played viola in the Cleveland Philharmonic while at Case, and taught mathematics classes at the college after graduation. He continued on to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he pursued his PhD in physics. His interest in particle physics led him to work with Nobel laureate Carl David Anderson, studying cosmic rays with cloud chambers. He preferred the accessibility of cosmic ray research over that of nuclear physics. While at Caltech he learned to design and build the equipment he needed for his experiments, and this skill would prove to be useful throughout his career. He also attended molecular genetics seminars led by Nobel laureate Max Delbrück; he would return to this field later. 
Glaser completed his doctoral thesis, &quot;The Momentum Distribution of Charged Cosmic Ray Particles Near Sea Level&quot;, after starting as an instructor at the University of Michigan in 1949. He received his PhD from Caltech in 1950, and he was promoted to professor at Michigan in 1957.

==Bubble chamber==
While teaching at Michigan, Glaser began to work on experiments that led to the creation of the bubble chamber. His experience with cloud chambers at Caltech had shown him that they were inadequate for studying elementary particles. In a cloud chamber, particles pass through gas and collide with metal plates that obscure the scientists&#x27; view of the event. The cloud chamber also needs time to reset between recording events and cannot keep up with accelerators&#x27; rate of particle production.

He experimented with using superheated liquid in a glass chamber. Charged particles would leave a track of bubbles as they passed through the liquid, and their tracks could be photographed. He created the first bubble chamber with ether. He experimented with hydrogen while visiting the University of Chicago, showing that hydrogen would also work in the chamber.

It has often been claimed that Glaser was inspired to his invention by the bubbles in a glass of beer; however, in a 2006 talk, he refuted this story, saying that although beer was not the &quot;inspiration&quot; for the bubble chamber, he did experiments using beer to fill early prototypes.

His new invention was ideal for use with high-energy accelerators, so Glaser traveled to Brookhaven National Laboratory with some students to study elementary particles using the accelerator there. The images that he created with his bubble chamber brought recognition of the importance of his device, and he was able to get funding to continue experimenting with larger chambers. Glaser was then recruited by Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez, who was working on a hydrogen bubble chamber at the University of California at Berkeley. Glaser accepted an offer to become a professor of physics there in 1959.

==Nobel Prize==
Glaser was awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize for Physics for the invention of the bubble chamber. His invention allowed scientists to observe what happens to high-energy beams from an accelerator, thus paving the way for many important discoveries.

==Other awards and honors==
* Elliott Cresson Medal (1961)
*Elected to the National Academy of Sciences (1962)
* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1989)
*Elected to the American Philosophical Society (1997)
*Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2003)

==Transition to molecular biology==
After winning the Nobel Prize, Glaser began to think about switching from physics into a new field. He wanted to concentrate on science, and found that as the experiments and equipment grew larger in scale and cost, he was doing more administrative work. He also anticipated that the ever-more-complex equipment would cause consolidation into fewer sites and would require more travel for physicists working in high-energy physics.
Recalling his interest in molecular genetics that began at Caltech, Glaser began to study biology. He spent a semester at MIT as a visiting professor and attended biology seminars there, and also spent a semester at Copenhagen with Ole Maaloe, the prominent Danish molecular biologist.

Glazer told his business colleagues at Cetus that after winning the Nobel prize he decided he had spent the first part of his life studying the physical world and that he now wanted to study the basis of life itself so he changed to studying biology and genetics. He made the comment “As a physicist and highly trained engineer my immediate thought upon entering my first biology lab was that Louis Pasteur would be comfortable working there.” He then went on to develop equipment to automate various biological processes. In fact, Cetus was originally formed to utilize his inventions and expertise with its first projects focused on producing higher yielding antibiotic strains as the company then evolved, pioneering the field of biotechnology.

He worked in UC Berkeley&#x27;s Virus Lab (now the Biochemistry and Virus Laboratory), doing experiments with bacterial phages, bacteria, and mammalian cells. He studied the development of cancer cells, in particular the skin cancer &quot;xeroderma pigmentosum&quot;. As with the bubble chamber, he used his experience designing equipment to improve the experimental process. He automated the process of pouring out agar, spreading culture, and counting colonies of cells using a machine he called the dumbwaiter. It took photographs, administered chemicals, and had a mechanical hand to pick up colonies.

==Commercial ventures==
While continuing to work at UC Berkeley, Glaser started Berkeley Scientific Laboratory with Bill Wattenberg in 1968. The short-lived partnership worked on automating diagnostic procedures.

In 1971 he founded Cetus Corporation with Moshe Alafi, Ron Cape, and Peter Farley. Glaser&#x27;s position was chairman of the science advisory board. The founders felt that the knowledge scientists had gained about DNA had not yet been applied to solve real problems. The company did microbial strain improvement, and then genetic engineering, becoming the first biotechnology company. Cetus was purchased by Chiron Corporation in 1991.

==Transition to neurobiology==
As molecular biology became more dependent on biochemistry, Glaser again considered a career change. His experience automating visual tasks in physics and molecular biology led him to an interest in human vision and how the brain processes what is seen. He began to work on computational modeling of the visual system and visual psychophysics, and spent a sabbatical at the Rowland Institute for Science.

<doc id="375393" wikidata="Q1116359" url="?curid=375393" title="Wong Tai Sin Temple (Hong Kong)">
<text>Wong Tai Sin Temple (Chinese: 黃大仙祠) is a well known shrine and tourist attraction in Hong Kong. It is dedicated to Wong Tai Sin, or the Great Immortal Wong. The Taoist temple is famed for the many prayers answered: &quot;What you request is what you get&quot; () via a practice called &quot;kau chim&quot;. The temple is located on the southern side of Lion Rock in the north of Kowloon.

==History==

In the early 20th century, Leung Yan-am () from Namgong village (稔岡) near Mount Sai Chiu in Namhoi, Guangdong Province spread the influence of Wong Tai Sin to Wan Chai in Hong Kong. Wong Tai Sin was obscure and largely unknown before Leung took it to Hong Kong.

Leung arrived in Hong Kong in 1915. He rented an apartment in Wan Chai, and set up an altar to Wong Tai Sin in his apartment. For the image of Wong Tai Sin, he used a picture of Wong Tai Sin which he brought from Namgong village. By March 1916, he opened an herbal medicine shop nearby and moved the altar to the back of the shop. Customers coming to his shop could pray at Wong Tai Sin&#x27;s altar and seek advice for their ailments. Leung would then fill their prescriptions. The popularity of Wong Tai Sin then began to grow.

However, in 1918, Leung&#x27;s shop was destroyed by fire. Then, Leung moved back to Namgong as he was now 57 or 58 years old and only could live for three years.

In 1921, Leung said that he received a message from Wong Tai Sin instructing him to construct a new shrine through &quot;Fu Ji&quot; (), a divination technique that uses a suspended sieve or tray to guide a stick which writes Chinese characters in sand or incense ashes. Leung Yan-am and his Taoist fellow were advised to start walking to the site which was 3600 paces from a pier They found the spot which was about the right distance form Kowloon City Pier. When they arrived at Chuk Yuen Village (), they put a piece of bamboo into the ground as a mark. Then they consulted Wong Tai Sin via the process of &quot;Fu Ji&quot;. They were told that it was a good site. Wong Tai Sin also taught them to determine the would-be centre of the Temple by 3 Chinese feet (approximately ) on the right and 3 Chinese feet backwards of the mark and the would-be temple was named as &quot;Chik Chung Sin Shrine&quot; (). The Taoist priests were also asked to start the construction of the shrine on 24th of the sixth lunar month by one of the Taoist Gods, Wen Chang Di () via the process of &quot;Fu Ji&quot;. Eventually the shrine was completed and was officiated on the 20th of the seventh lunar month. In the same year, on the 23rd of the eighth lunar month, during the celebration of the birthday of Wong Tai Sin, the altar was named as &quot;Pu Yi Tan&quot; () by the most supreme Taoist God, Yu Di () via the process of &quot;Fu Ji&quot;. Later on, the other Taoist God, Wen Chang Di gave the name of the premises as &quot;Sik Sik Yuen&quot; () via the process of &quot;Fu Ji&quot;. Meanwhile, the managing body, Sik Sik Yuen was established. In 1925, the shrine was renamed as &quot;Chik Chung Wong Sin Hall&quot; () by Taoist Immortal, Lü Dongbin () through the process of &quot;Fu Ji&quot;. Since then, the name &quot;Chik Chung Wong Sin Hall&quot; has replaced the original name.

The funds of building the temple were mainly by four rich businessmen. It is likely that these men had been clients of Leung&#x27;s medical prescription shrine in Wan Chai, and had become believers as a result of the benefits they believed could be obtained from these prescriptions.

During and after the World War Two, many Chinese escaped to Hong Kong from China and they only could settle in the Kowloon site which near the temple. These immigrants became refugees in Hong Kong. The Wong Tai Sin Temple, overlooking large stretches of these squatter settlements in the 1950s., filled a need for a major local shrine among this rapidly growing population eager for upward mobility. These people needed a god whose attention was not already occupied by the locals, luckily, Wong Tai Sin Temple was ready to receive any and all new worshippers, like these immigrants. The popularity of Wong Tai Sin Temple had rapidly been grown since that time.

According to the then regulations, Sik Sik Yuen used to be a private shrine and only Taoists or their family members were allowed. It was not until 1934, Sik Sik Yuen formally applied to the government for opening the Temple to the public during the 1st lunar month of every Chinese New Year. Finally, Sik Sik Yuen was allowed to open completely to the public in 1956.

In 1956, the government proposed to reclaim the temple for public housing development. Chairman Wong Wan Tin&#x27;s pushed for the temple to remain open. Charging a 10-cent admission fee at the main entrance, fees were donated to the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals. To facilitate administration and management, the temple was registered as a limited company of charitable nature in 1965, and was granted the immunity of not having to add the word &quot;Limited&quot; to the organisation&#x27;s name.

Because of its historic significance, the Temple is graded as a Grade I historic building. The temple also is the first Taoist temple allowed by the government to organise Taoist weddings and issue marriage certificates.

==Facilities==

The temple consists of traditional Chinese architecture with red pillars, a gold roof with blue friezes, yellow latticework and multi-coloured carvings.

There is a Nine-Dragon Wall modelled after one in Beijing. Some of the halls include the Great Hall () and the Three-Saint Hall (). The Three-Saint Hall is dedicated to Lü Dongbin, Guan Yin, and Lord Guan. Containing a portrait of Confucius, the Taoist temple has a collection of Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist literature.

There are also three memorial archways in the temple, with the first carved with the name of the temple at the entrance. The second memorial is along past the fortune-telling stalls, and the third one further ahead.

==Traditions==
Annually, from 1 to 15 January, the temple receives numerous visitors, such as those whose prayers were answered returning to thank the immortal. Wong Tai Sin&#x27;s birthday on the 23rd day of the 8th lunar month, and the Chinese New Year holidays are the busiest times for the temple.

On the Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve, thousands of worshippers wait outside the temple before midnight and rush in to the main altar to offer Wong Tai Sin their glowing incense sticks when the year comes. As the tradition goes, the earlier they offer the incense, the better luck they will have that year.

Most of the visitors come to the temple in search for a spiritual answer via a practice called &quot;kau chim&quot;. They light incense sticks, kneel before the main altar, make a wish, and shake a bamboo cylinder containing fortune sticks until a stick falls out. This stick is exchanged for a piece of paper bearing the same number, and then the soothsayer will interpret the fortune on the paper for the worshiper. Often the same piece of fortune is taken to multiple booths for verification purposes. Some booths offer palm reading service.

Recently, Taoist weddings have been performed here.

==Operation==
The temple is open from 7:00am to 5:00pm throughout the year, and runs overnight in the Lunar New Year Eve. It is currently administered by Sik Sik Yuen (嗇色園) a Taoist organisation in Hong Kong.

<text>William Charles Macready (3 March 179327 April 1873) was an English stage actor. The son of Irish actor-manager William Macready the Elder he emerged as a leading West End performer during the Regency era.

==Career==

He was born in London the son of William Macready the Elder, and actress Christina Ann Birch. Educated at Rugby School where he became headboy, and where now the theatre is named after him, it was his initial intention to go to University of Oxford, but, in 1809, financial problems experienced by his father, the lessee of several provincial theatres, called him to share the responsibilities of theatrical management. On 7 June 1810, he made a successful first appearance as Romeo at Birmingham. Other Shakespearian parts followed, but a serious rupture between father and son resulted in the young man&#x27;s departure for Bath in 1814. Here he remained for two years, with occasional professional visits to other provincial towns.

On 16 September 1816, Macready made his first London appearance at Covent Garden as Orestes in &quot;The Distressed Mother&quot;, a translation of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Andromaque&quot; by Ambrose Philips. Macready&#x27;s choice of characters was at first confined chiefly to the romantic drama. In 1818, he won a permanent success in Isaac Pocock&#x27;s (1782–1835) adaptation of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Rob Roy&quot;. He showed his capacity for the highest tragedy when he played &quot;Richard III&quot; at Covent Garden on 25 October 1819.

In 1820, he played the title role in the tragedy &quot;Virginius&quot; by James Sheridan Knowles. Transferring his services to Drury Lane, he gradually rose in public favour, his most conspicuous success being in the title role of Sheridan Knowles&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; (11 May 1825). In 1826, he completed a successful engagement in the United States, and, in 1828, his performances met with a very flattering reception in Paris. In 1829, he appeared as Othello in Warwick.

On 15 December 1830 he appeared at Drury Lane as Werner, one of his most powerful impersonations. In 1833, he played in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, in Byron&#x27;s &quot;Sardanapalus&quot;, and in &quot;King Lear&quot;. He was responsible, in 1834, and more fully in 1838, for returning the text of &quot;King Lear&quot; to Shakespeare&#x27;s text (although in a shortened version), after it had been replaced for more than a hundred and fifty years by Nahum Tate&#x27;s happy-ending adaptation, &quot;The History of King Lear&quot;. He performed at the Georgian Wisbech theatre (now Angles Theatre) and other theatres of the Lincoln theatre circuit run by Fanny Robertson.

Already, Macready had done something to encourage the creation of a modern English drama, and after entering on the management of Covent Garden in 1837 he introduced Robert Browning&#x27;s &quot;Strafford&quot;, and in the following year Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of Lyons&quot; and &quot;Richelieu&quot;, the principal characters in which were among his most effective parts. On 10 June 1838, he gave a memorable performance of &quot;Henry V&quot;, for which Stanfield prepared sketches, and the mounting was superintended by Bulwer-Lytton, Dickens, Forster, Maclise, W. J. Fox and other friends.

Dickens wrote to him in 1847: &quot;The multitude of tokens by which I know you for a great man, the swelling within me of my love for you, the pride I have in you, the majestic reflection I see in you of the passions and affections that make up our mystery, throw me into a strange kind of transport that has no expression but in a mute sense of an attachment which in truth and fervency is worthy of its subject.&quot;

The first production of Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot; took place under the artistic direction of Count d&#x27;Orsay on 8 December 1840, Macready winning unmistakable success in the character of Alfred Evelyn. Both in his management of Covent Garden, which he resigned in 1839, and of Drury Lane, which he held from 1841 to 1843, he found his designs for the elevation of the stage frustrated by the absence of adequate public support.

In 1843, he staged &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. In 1843–44, he made a successful tour in the United States, but his last visit to that country, in 1849, was marred by the Astor Place Riot, in which between 22 and 31 rioters were dead, and more than 120 people injured.
Judge Charles Patrick Daly later presided at the trial. Both Forrest and Macready were playing Macbeth in concurrent, competing productions at the time of the riot, a fact which added to the ominous reputation of that play. Playwright Richard Nelson dramatized the events surrounding the riot in his 1990 play, &quot;Two Shakespearean Actors&quot;.

Macready took leave of the stage in a farewell performance of Macbeth at Drury Lane on 26 February 1851. The remainder of his life was spent in happy retirement, and he died at Cheltenham on 27 April 1873.

==Personal life==
He married twice, firstly in 1823 to Catherine Frances Atkins (died 1852). Of a numerous family of children only one son and one daughter survived. In 1860, aged 67, he married the 23 year old Cecile Louise Frederica Spencer (1827–1908), by whom he had a son, Cecil Frederick Nevil Macready, known as &quot;Nevil&quot;, who would become a General in the British Army, and a baronet. Macready&#x27;s son from his second marriage was General Sir Nevil Macready, a distinguished British Army officer as was his brother, Major Edward Nevil Macready, who commanded the Light Company of the 30th Regiment of Foot in the closing stages of the Battle of Waterloo.

His daughter, Catherine Frances Macready, was a minor Victorian poet. Her book, &quot;Leaves From the Olive Mount&quot;, published by Chapman &amp; Hall in 1860, began with a one-page dedication poem, &#x27;To My Father&#x27;. Writer Rowena Farre (Daphne Lois Macready) was a great-granddaughter of William Macready. 

Upon his death, William Macready&#x27;s remains were deposited in the catacomb below the Anglican Chapel at Kensal Green Cemetery.

==Evaluation and legacy==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition:
When Macready retired, Alfred Tennyson dedicated the following verse to him:
In 1927, the Cheltenham Local Tablets Committee placed a bronze tablet at No. 6 Wellington Square recording Macready&#x27;s residence there from 1860 to 1873.

The London County Council affixed a blue plaque to Macready&#x27;s birthplace, 45 Stanhope Street, Regent&#x27;s Park on 25 June 1928. The house was subsequently demolished, the plaque being donated to the Theatre Museum c1965, the object passing to the V&amp;A in 2007.

Actor Frank Barrie wrote and performed the one-man play &quot;Macready!&quot;, which was first performed in 1979 and eventually staged in 65 countries. A television adaptation of the play was broadcast on Channel 4 in 1983 as a one-hour special, again starring Frank Barrie.

<text>The English Springer Spaniel is a breed of gun dog in the Spaniel group traditionally used for flushing and retrieving game. They are descended from the Norfolk or Shropshire Spaniels of the mid-19th century; the breed has diverged into separate show and working lines. It is closely related to the Welsh Springer Spaniel and very closely to the English Cocker Spaniel; less than a century ago, springers and cockers would come from the same litter. The smaller &quot;cockers&quot; were used in woodcock hunting while their larger littermates were used to flush, or &quot;spring&quot;, other game birds, hence the name. In 1902, The Kennel Club recognized the English Springer Spaniel as a distinct breed. They are used as sniffer dogs on a widespread basis.

== Description ==

The English Springer Spaniel is a medium-sized compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on the legs and tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds but are registered together. The gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog would not have the speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.

The English Springer Spaniel field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than show-bred dogs. The ears are less pendulous. Field-bred dogs are wiry and have more of a feral look than those bred for showing. The tail of the field-bred dog may be docked a few inches in comparison to the show dog. Field-bred dogs are selected for their sense of smell, hunting ability, and response to training rather than appearance.

Show dogs have longer fur and more pendant ears, dewlaps and dangling flews. The tail is docked to a short stub in those countries that permit docking. They are generally more thickly boned and heavier than field-bred springers.

The English Springer Spaniel is similar to the English Cocker Spaniel and at first glance, the only major difference is the latter&#x27;s smaller size. However English Springers also tend to have shorter, and higher-set ears than English Cockers. Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle; their eyes are not as prominent, and the coat is less abundant.

=== Coat and colors ===
Field-bred dogs tend to have shorter, coarser coats than the longer furred show-bred dogs. They normally only shed in summer and spring months but shed occasionally in the autumn. The coat may come in black or liver (dark brown) with white markings or predominantly white with black or liver markings; blue or liver roan; or tricolour consisting of black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually found on eyebrows, cheeks, inside of ears and under the tail. Any white portion of the coat may be flecked with ticking.

=== Sizes ===
Males in the show dog line are typically approximately at the withers and weigh . According to the UK Breed Standard, the English Springer Spaniel should be at the withers. The females should be and usually . Working types can be lighter in weight and finer in bone.

== Health ==
A 2022 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.92 years for the breed, above the average of 11.23 years. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.5 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2005 Swedish study found 29% of Springer Spaniels died by the age of 10, less than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.

Skin conditions the breed is predisposed to include: acral mutilation syndrome, intertrigo, lichenoid psoriasis–form dermatitis, Malassezia dermatitis, otitis externa, and primary seborrhoea.

An American study reviewing over a million cases presented to 27 veterinary teaching hospitals in North America found the English Springer Spaniel to be prediposed to canine hip dysplasia, with 4.39% of dogs having the condition compared to 3.52% overall. A survey of UK breed club members found cancer to be the most common cause of death at 26.7% of deaths.

English Springer Spaniels have a predisposition to chronic hepatitis. The form of chronic hepatitis in the breed is more severe, affects younger dogs, and is more likely to affect bitches. One study found the English Springer Spaniel to be 6.3 times more likely to acquire the disease. Another study found an odds ratio of 5.3.

== History ==
The English physician John Caius described the spaniel in his book the &quot;Treatise of Englishe Dogs&quot; published in 1576. His book was the first work to describe the various British breeds by function. By 1801, Sydenham Edwards explained in the &quot;Cynographia Britannica&quot; that the land spaniel should be split into two kinds, the Springing, Hawking Spaniel, or Starter; and the Cocking or Cocker Spaniel.

At this point, both cocker spaniels and springer spaniels were born in the same litters. The purpose of the breed was to serve as a hunting dog. The smaller cockers were used to hunt woodcock, while their larger littermates, the springer spaniels, would &quot;spring&quot;—or flush—the gamebird into the air where a trained falcon or hawk would bring it to the handler.

Many spaniel breeds were developed during the 19th century, and often named after the counties in which they were developed, or after their owners, who were usually nobility. Two strains of larger land spaniel were predominant and were said to have been of &quot;true springer type.&quot; These were the Norfolk and the Shropshire spaniels, and by the 1850s, these were shown under the breed name of Norfolk spaniel.

In January 1899, the Spaniel Club of England and the Sporting Spaniel Society held their trials together for the first time. Three years later, in 1902, a combination of the physical standard from the Spaniel Club of England and the ability standard from the Sporting Spaniel Society led to the English Springer Spaniel breed being officially recognized by the English Kennel Club. The American Kennel Club followed in 1910. In 1914, the first English Field Champion was crowned, FTC Rivington Sam, whose dam was a registered cocker spaniel, Rivington Riband. Sam is considered one of the foundation sires for modern field lines.

==Detection dog==
The Springer Spaniel is used as a sniffer dog. Notable search dogs have included Buster, a Dickin Medal recipient, Royal Army Veterinary Corps arms and explosives search dog serving with the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment in Iraq, for finding an extremist group&#x27;s hidden arsenal of weapons and explosives. Another example is Jake, aka Hubble Keck People&#x27;s Dispensary for Sick Animals Gold Medal and Blue Cross Animal Hospital Medal recipient, a London Metropolitan Police explosives search dog. He was deployed at Tavistock Square, Russell Square and King&#x27;s Cross following the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

The Springer is not limited to detecting explosives. Other varied uses for the Springer can include sniffing out bumblebee nests, illegal immigrants, blood and the superbug C. difficile. Springers are used for drug detection in the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Isle of Man, Ireland, Canada CBSA and Qatar.

The Springer Spaniel is also used as a search and rescue dog by mountain rescue and Lowland Rescue teams, where their willingness to work and cover rough terrain makes them an excellent choice.

<text>The Miniature Schnauzer is a breed of small dog of the Schnauzer type that originated in Germany in the mid-to-late 19th century. Miniature Schnauzers may have been developed from the smallest specimens of the Standard Schnauzer, or crosses between the standard and one or more smaller breeds such as the Affenpinscher, Miniature Pinscher, and Poodles, as farmers bred a small dog that was an efficient ratting dog. They are described as &quot;spunky&quot; but aloof dogs, with good guarding tendencies without some guard dogs&#x27; predisposition to bite. Miniature Schnauzers are recognized in four colors internationally: solid black, black and silver, salt and pepper, and white.

It is the most popular Schnauzer breed, and remains one of the most popular worldwide, primarily for its temperament and relatively small size. As of 2022 it is the 17th most popular breed in the U.S.

==History==
The earliest records surrounding the development of the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. They were originally bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it, according to cynologist theorization, with one or more small breeds such as the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle, Miniature Pinscher, or Pomeranian, or by chance from smallest specimens of the Standard Schnauzer. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, black female named Findel, and the Pinscher-Schnauzer Klub (formed in 1895) in its first volume of the club&#x27;s stud book mentioned Wirehaired Miniature Pinscher. The first exhibition was held in 1899.

The American Kennel Club accepted registration of the new breed in 1926, two years after Miniature Schnauzers were introduced to the United States. The American Miniature Schnauzer Club was formed in 1933, from the older parent club Wire-Haired Pinscher Club of America which also included Standard Schnauzer, and initially both competed in the Working Group until 1927. International Kennel Club classifications vary; by the VDH and FCI it is placed in &quot;Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers&quot;, with &quot;Nr. 183&quot; in &quot;Section 1.2&quot; dedicated to the Miniature Schnauzer breed, the KC, ANKC and NZKC include it in the Utility Group, while by the AKC, UKC and CKC the Miniature Schnauzer is classed in the Terrier Group.

The start of the modern Miniature Schnauzer in the United States is considered to have a beginning in 1924 when four dogs were imported from Germany. It is argued that almost all American-bred Miniatures partly descend from them, and between 1926 and 1936, 108 more dogs were imported. One of the most notable champions was Ch. Dorem Display, born in 1945 and lived to be nearly fourteen. It is claimed that many champion Miniature Schnauzers in America can trace their lineage back to Dorem Display.

Miniature Schnauzers were the 11th most popular breed in the U.S. in 2008, falling to 17th most popular in 2016.

==Appearance==

Miniature Schnauzers have a very square-shaped build, measuring tall and weighing for females and for males. They have a double coat, with wiry exterior fur and a soft undercoat. In show trim, the coat is kept short on the body, but the fur on the ears, legs, belly, and face is retained. Recognized coat colors are black, pepper and salt, black and silver, and pure white; pepper and salt coloration is where coat hairs have banded shades of black, gray and silver, fading to a gray or silver at the eyebrows, whiskers, underbody and legs.

Schnauzers are characterized by a rectangular head with bushy beard, mustache, and eyebrows; teeth that meet in a &quot;scissor bite&quot;; oval and dark colored eyes; and v-shaped, natural forward-folding ears (when cropped, the ears point straight upward and come to a sharp point). Their tails are naturally thin and short, and may be docked (where permitted). They will also have very straight, rigid front legs, and feet that are short and round (so-called &quot;cat feet&quot;) with thick, black pads.

Docking of tails and cropping of ears has become a controversial practice, especially for non-working dogs, and is now illegal or restricted in a number of countries worldwide, including the UK and Australia.

===Grooming===
Schnauzers have a specific groom cut that is standard among the schnauzer breeds. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping, or by clipping. Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. When kept as pets, Miniature Schnauzers are often groomed differently (usually via clipping) from show dogs (often using stripping). Regular grooming of a Miniature Schnauzer is recommended approximately every six weeks. Clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.


===North American white coat controversy===

White is one of four color varieties of the Miniature Schnauzer currently recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. However, they are not accepted for conformation showing by the American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club. The controversy rests on the disputed origins of the white variation, namely whether it was contained within the genes of the originally recognized breed, or whether it was the result of subsequent modifications. Since the other two schnauzer types have never been available in a white variation, and the original German standard never included white as an acceptable color, the American Miniature Schnauzer Club chooses not to recognize white.

==Temperament==

The American Kennel Club breed standard describes temperament as &quot;alert and spirited, yet obedient to command ... friendly, intelligent and willing to please... never overaggressive or timid&quot;. Usually easy to train, they tend to be excellent watchdogs with a good territorial instinct, but more inclined toward barking than biting. They are often aloof with strangers until the owners of the home welcome the guest, upon which they are typically very friendly to them. While the Miniature Schnauzer is included in the Terrier Group in North America (due to rat-catching background), it does not have common ancestry with Terriers from Great Britain, and compared to them has a different personality, being more laid back, obedient, friendly, and less aggressive to other dogs.

Miniature Schnauzers can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking. Schnauzers have a high prey drive, which means they may chase other small animals and hence should not be off leash when not in a fenced area. Stanley Coren ranked the Miniature Schnauzer 12th out of 140 breeds in his book &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot; (2006). Coren grouped the breed amongst &quot;excellent working dogs&quot;. Additionally, experts contacted by Coren ranked the Miniature as fifth among top 15 breeds at watchdog barking ability.

==Health==
A UK study found a life expectancy of 13.3 years for the breed, higher than the 12 year average for crossbreeds. A study in Japan for pet cemetery data found a life expectancy of 13.4 years, below the overall average of 13.7 years and the 15.3 year average for crossbreeds below 10 kg.

A Japanese study found a significant predisposition to gall bladder mucoceles for the Miniature Schnauzer with a 5.23 odds ratio.

A North American study found the breed to be predisposed to congenital portosystemic shunts, with 1% of Miniature Schnauzers having the condition compared to 0.05% for mixed-breed dogs.

Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.

The breed is predisposed to atopic dermatitis.

Schnauzer comedo syndrome is a type of follicular keratinisation defect found exclusively in the Miniature Schnauzer that is similar to nevus comedonicus in humans. The condition is characterised by small comedones developing on the dorsal spine (back) of the dog. The condition is believed to be caused by an inherited developmental defect in hair follicles, causing abnormal keratinisation and subsequently comedo formation, follicular plugging, and secondary bacterial folliculitis which leads to alopecia and crusting.

<text>Computer simulation is the running of a mathematical model on a computer, the model being designed to represent the behaviour of, or the outcome of, a real-world or physical system. The reliability of some mathematical models can be determined by comparing their results to the real-world outcomes they aim to predict. Computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics (computational physics), astrophysics, climatology, chemistry, biology and manufacturing, as well as human systems in economics, psychology, social science, health care and engineering. Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system&#x27;s model. It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions.

Computer simulations are realized by running computer programs that can be either small, running almost instantly on small devices, or large-scale programs that run for hours or days on network-based groups of computers. The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible (or perhaps even imaginable) using traditional paper-and-pencil mathematical modeling. In 1997, a desert-battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66,239 tanks, trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait, using multiple supercomputers in the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program.
Other examples include a 1-billion-atom model of material deformation; a 2.64-million-atom model of the complex protein-producing organelle of all living organisms, the ribosome, in 2005;
a complete simulation of the life cycle of &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; in 2012; and the Blue Brain project at EPFL (Switzerland), begun in May 2005 to create the first computer simulation of the entire human brain, right down to the molecular level.

Because of the computational cost of simulation, computer experiments are used to perform inference such as uncertainty quantification.

== Simulation versus model ==
A model consists of the equations used to capture the behavior of a system. By contrast, computer simulation is the actual running of the program that perform algorithms which solve those equations, often in an approximate manner. Simulation, therefore, is the process of running a model. Thus one would not &quot;build a simulation&quot;; instead, one would &quot;build a model (or a simulator)&quot;, and then either &quot;run the model&quot; or equivalently &quot;run a simulation&quot;.

== History ==
Computer simulation developed hand-in-hand with the rapid growth of the computer, following its first large-scale deployment during the Manhattan Project in World War II to model the process of nuclear detonation. It was a simulation of 12 hard spheres using a Monte Carlo algorithm. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitute for, modeling systems for which simple closed form analytic solutions are not possible. There are many types of computer simulations; their common feature is the attempt to generate a sample of representative scenarios for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states of the model would be prohibitive or impossible.

== Data preparation ==
The external data requirements of simulations and models vary widely. For some, the input might be just a few numbers (for example, simulation of a waveform of AC electricity on a wire), while others might require terabytes of information (such as weather and climate models).

Input sources also vary widely:
* Sensors and other physical devices connected to the model;
* Control surfaces used to direct the progress of the simulation in some way;
* Current or historical data entered by hand;
* Values extracted as a by-product from other processes;
* Values output for the purpose by other simulations, models, or processes.

Lastly, the time at which data is available varies:
* &quot;invariant&quot; data is often built into the model code, either because the value is truly invariant (e.g., the value of π) or because the designers consider the value to be invariant for all cases of interest;
* data can be entered into the simulation when it starts up, for example by reading one or more files, or by reading data from a preprocessor;
* data can be provided during the simulation run, for example by a sensor network.

Because of this variety, and because diverse simulation systems have many common elements, there are a large number of specialized simulation languages. The best-known may be Simula. There are now many others.

Systems that accept data from external sources must be very careful in knowing what they are receiving. While it is easy for computers to read in values from text or binary files, what is much harder is knowing what the accuracy (compared to measurement resolution and precision) of the values are. Often they are expressed as &quot;error bars&quot;, a minimum and maximum deviation from the value range within which the true value (is expected to) lie. Because digital computer mathematics is not perfect, rounding and truncation errors multiply this error, so it is useful to perform an &quot;error analysis&quot; to confirm that values output by the simulation will still be usefully accurate.

== Types ==
Models used for computer simulations can be classified according to several independent pairs of attributes, including:
* Stochastic or deterministic (and as a special case of deterministic, chaotic) – see external links below for examples of stochastic vs. deterministic simulations
* Steady-state or dynamic
* Continuous or discrete (and as an important special case of discrete, discrete event or DE models)
* Dynamic system simulation, e.g. electric systems, hydraulic systems or multi-body mechanical systems (described primarily by DAE:s) or dynamics simulation of field problems, e.g. CFD of FEM simulations (described by PDE:s).
* Local or distributed.

Another way of categorizing models is to look at the underlying data structures. For time-stepped simulations, there are two main classes:
* Simulations which store their data in regular grids and require only next-neighbor access are called stencil codes. Many CFD applications belong to this category.
* If the underlying graph is not a regular grid, the model may belong to the meshfree method class.

For steady-state simulations, equations define the relationships between elements of the modeled system and attempt to find a state in which the system is in equilibrium. Such models are often used in simulating physical systems, as a simpler modeling case before dynamic simulation is attempted.
* Dynamic simulations attempt to capture changes in a system in response to (usually changing) input signals.
* &quot;Stochastic&quot; models use &quot;random number generators&quot; to model chance or random events;
* A &quot;discrete event simulation&quot; (DES) manages events in time. Most computer, logic-test and fault-tree simulations are of this type. In this type of simulation, the simulator maintains a queue of events sorted by the simulated time they should occur. The simulator reads the queue and triggers new events as each event is processed. It is not important to execute the simulation in real time. It is often more important to be able to access the data produced by the simulation and to discover logic defects in the design or the sequence of events.
* A &quot;continuous dynamic simulation&quot; performs numerical solution of differential-algebraic equations or differential equations (either partial or ordinary). Periodically, the simulation program solves all the equations and uses the numbers to change the state and output of the simulation. Applications include flight simulators, construction and management simulation games, chemical process modeling, and simulations of electrical circuits. Originally, these kinds of simulations were actually implemented on analog computers, where the differential equations could be represented directly by various electrical components such as op-amps. By the late 1980s, however, most &quot;analog&quot; simulations were run on conventional digital computers that emulate the behavior of an analog computer.
* A special type of discrete simulation that does not rely on a model with an underlying equation, but can nonetheless be represented formally, is agent-based simulation. In agent-based simulation, the individual entities (such as molecules, cells, trees or consumers) in the model are represented directly (rather than by their density or concentration) and possess an internal state and set of behaviors or rules that determine how the agent&#x27;s state is updated from one time-step to the next.
* Distributed models run on a network of interconnected computers, possibly through the Internet. Simulations dispersed across multiple host computers like this are often referred to as &quot;distributed simulations&quot;. There are several standards for distributed simulation, including Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol (ALSP), Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS), the High Level Architecture (simulation) (HLA) and the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).

== Visualization ==
Formerly, the output data from a computer simulation was sometimes presented in a table or a matrix showing how data were affected by numerous changes in the simulation parameters. The use of the matrix format was related to traditional use of the matrix concept in mathematical models. However, psychologists and others noted that humans could quickly perceive trends by looking at graphs or even moving-images or motion-pictures generated from the data, as displayed by computer-generated-imagery (CGI) animation. Although observers could not necessarily read out numbers or quote math formulas, from observing a moving weather chart they might be able to predict events (and &quot;see that rain was headed their way&quot;) much faster than by scanning tables of rain-cloud coordinates. Such intense graphical displays, which transcended the world of numbers and formulae, sometimes also led to output that lacked a coordinate grid or omitted timestamps, as if straying too far from numeric data displays. Today, weather forecasting models tend to balance the view of moving rain/snow clouds against a map that uses numeric coordinates and numeric timestamps of events.

Similarly, CGI computer simulations of CAT scans can simulate how a tumor might shrink or change during an extended period of medical treatment, presenting the passage of time as a spinning view of the visible human head, as the tumor changes.

Other applications of CGI computer simulations are being developed to graphically display large amounts of data, in motion, as changes occur during a simulation run.

== In science ==
Generic examples of types of computer simulations in science, which are derived from an underlying mathematical description:
* a numerical simulation of differential equations that cannot be solved analytically, theories that involve continuous systems such as phenomena in physical cosmology, fluid dynamics (e.g., climate models, roadway noise models, roadway air dispersion models), continuum mechanics and chemical kinetics fall into this category.
* a stochastic simulation, typically used for discrete systems where events occur probabilistically and which cannot be described directly with differential equations (this is a &quot;discrete&quot; simulation in the above sense). Phenomena in this category include genetic drift, biochemical or gene regulatory networks with small numbers of molecules. (see also: Monte Carlo method).
* multiparticle simulation of the response of nanomaterials at multiple scales to an applied force for the purpose of modeling their thermoelastic and thermodynamic properties. Techniques used for such simulations are Molecular dynamics, Molecular mechanics, Monte Carlo method, and Multiscale Green&#x27;s function.

Specific examples of computer simulations include:
* statistical simulations based upon an agglomeration of a large number of input profiles, such as the forecasting of equilibrium temperature of receiving waters, allowing the gamut of meteorological data to be input for a specific locale. This technique was developed for thermal pollution forecasting.
* agent based simulation has been used effectively in ecology, where it is often called &quot;individual based modeling&quot; and is used in situations for which individual variability in the agents cannot be neglected, such as population dynamics of salmon and trout (most purely mathematical models assume all trout behave identically).
* time stepped dynamic model. In hydrology there are several such hydrology transport models such as the SWMM and DSSAM Models developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for river water quality forecasting.
* computer simulations have also been used to formally model theories of human cognition and performance, e.g., ACT-R.
* computer simulation using molecular modeling for drug discovery.
* computer simulation to model viral infection in mammalian cells.
* computer simulation for studying the selective sensitivity of bonds by mechanochemistry during grinding of organic molecules.
* Computational fluid dynamics simulations are used to simulate the behaviour of flowing air, water and other fluids. One-, two- and three-dimensional models are used. A one-dimensional model might simulate the effects of water hammer in a pipe. A two-dimensional model might be used to simulate the drag forces on the cross-section of an aeroplane wing. A three-dimensional simulation might estimate the heating and cooling requirements of a large building.
* An understanding of statistical thermodynamic molecular theory is fundamental to the appreciation of molecular solutions. Development of the Potential Distribution Theorem (PDT) allows this complex subject to be simplified to down-to-earth presentations of molecular theory.

Notable, and sometimes controversial, computer simulations used in science include: Donella Meadows&#x27; World3 used in the &quot;Limits to Growth&quot;, James Lovelock&#x27;s Daisyworld and Thomas Ray&#x27;s Tierra.

In social sciences, computer simulation is an integral component of the five angles of analysis fostered by the data percolation methodology, which also includes qualitative and quantitative methods, reviews of the literature (including scholarly), and interviews with experts, and which forms an extension of data triangulation. Of course, similar to any other scientific method, replication is an important part of computational modeling 

== In practical contexts ==

Computer simulations are used in a wide variety of practical contexts, such as:
* analysis of air pollutant dispersion using atmospheric dispersion modeling
* As a possible humane alternative to live animal testing in respect to animal rights.
* design of complex systems such as aircraft and also logistics systems.
* design of noise barriers to effect roadway noise mitigation
* modeling of application performance
* flight simulators to train pilots
* weather forecasting
* forecasting of risk
* simulation of electrical circuits
* Power system simulation
* simulation of other computers is emulation.
* forecasting of prices on financial markets (for example Adaptive Modeler)
* behavior of structures (such as buildings and industrial parts) under stress and other conditions
* design of industrial processes, such as chemical processing plants
* strategic management and organizational studies
* reservoir simulation for the petroleum engineering to model the subsurface reservoir
* process engineering simulation tools.
* robot simulators for the design of robots and robot control algorithms
* urban simulation models that simulate dynamic patterns of urban development and responses to urban land use and transportation policies.
* traffic engineering to plan or redesign parts of the street network from single junctions over cities to a national highway network to transportation system planning, design and operations. See a more detailed article on Simulation in Transportation.
* modeling car crashes to test safety mechanisms in new vehicle models.
* crop-soil systems in agriculture, via dedicated software frameworks (e.g. BioMA, OMS3, APSIM)

The reliability and the trust people put in computer simulations depends on the validity of the simulation model, therefore verification and validation are of crucial importance in the development of computer simulations. Another important aspect of computer simulations is that of reproducibility of the results, meaning that a simulation model should not provide a different answer for each execution. Although this might seem obvious, this is a special point of attention in stochastic simulations, where random numbers should actually be semi-random numbers. An exception to reproducibility are human-in-the-loop simulations such as flight simulations and computer games. Here a human is part of the simulation and thus influences the outcome in a way that is hard, if not impossible, to reproduce exactly.

Vehicle manufacturers make use of computer simulation to test safety features in new designs. By building a copy of the car in a physics simulation environment, they can save the hundreds of thousands of dollars that would otherwise be required to build and test a unique prototype. Engineers can step through the simulation milliseconds at a time to determine the exact stresses being put upon each section of the prototype.

Computer graphics can be used to display the results of a computer simulation. Animations can be used to experience a simulation in real-time, e.g., in training simulations. In some cases animations may also be useful in faster than real-time or even slower than real-time modes. For example, faster than real-time animations can be useful in visualizing the buildup of queues in the simulation of humans evacuating a building. Furthermore, simulation results are often aggregated into static images using various ways of scientific visualization.

In debugging, simulating a program execution under test (rather than executing natively) can detect far more errors than the hardware itself can detect and, at the same time, log useful debugging information such as instruction trace, memory alterations and instruction counts. This technique can also detect buffer overflow and similar &quot;hard to detect&quot; errors as well as produce performance information and tuning data.

== Pitfalls ==
Although sometimes ignored in computer simulations, it is very important to perform a sensitivity analysis to ensure that the accuracy of the results is properly understood. For example, the probabilistic risk analysis of factors determining the success of an oilfield exploration program involves combining samples from a variety of statistical distributions using the Monte Carlo method. If, for instance, one of the key parameters (e.g., the net ratio of oil-bearing strata) is known to only one significant figure, then the result of the simulation might not be more precise than one significant figure, although it might (misleadingly) be presented as having four significant figures.

<text>Ambrose Philips (167418 June 1749) was an English poet and politician. He feuded with other poets of his time, resulting in Henry Carey bestowing the nickname &quot;Namby-Pamby&quot; upon him, which came to mean affected, weak, and maudlin speech or verse.

Philips was born in Shropshire of a Leicestershire family. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow in 1699. He seems to have lived chiefly at Cambridge until he resigned his fellowship in 1708, and his pastorals were probably written in this period. He worked for Jacob Tonson the bookseller, and his &quot;Pastorals&quot; opened the sixth volume of Tonson&#x27;s &quot;Miscellanies&quot; (1709), which also contained the pastorals of Alexander Pope.

Philips was a staunch Whig, and a friend of Richard Steele and Joseph Addison. In Nos. 22, 23, 30 and 32 (1713) of &quot;The Guardian&quot; he was rashly praised as the only worthy successor to Edmund Spenser. The writer, probably Thomas Tickell, pointedly ignored Pope&#x27;s pastorals. In &quot;The Spectator&quot; Addison applauded Philips for his simplicity, and for having written English eclogues unencumbered by the machinery of classical mythology. Pope&#x27;s jealousy resulted in an anonymous contribution to the &quot;Guardian&quot; (No. 40), in which he drew an ironic comparison between his own and Philips&#x27;s pastorals, censuring himself and praising Philips&#x27;s worst passages. Philips is said to have threatened to hit Pope with a rod he kept hung up at Button&#x27;s Coffee House for the purpose.

At Pope&#x27;s request, John Gay burlesqued Philips&#x27;s pastorals in his &quot;Shepherd&#x27;s Week&quot;, but the parody was admired for the very quality of simplicity which it was intended to ridicule. Samuel Johnson describes the relations between Pope and Philips as a perpetual reciprocation of malevolence. Pope lost no opportunity of mocking Philips, who figured in the &quot;Bathos&quot; and the &quot;Dunciad&quot;, as Macer in the &quot;Characters&quot;; and in the instructions to a porter how to find Edmund Curll&#x27;s authors, Philips is a Pindaric writer in red stockings. Others who ridiculed him included Henry Carey, who coined the nickname &quot;Namby-Pamby&quot; in the 1725 poem of that name:

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:5px;&quot;&gt;
All ye poets of the age,
All ye witlings of the stage …
Namby-Pamby is your guide,
Albion&#x27;s joy, Hibernia&#x27;s pride.
Namby-Pamby, pilly-piss,
Rhimy-pim&#x27;d on Missy Miss
Tartaretta Tartaree
From the navel to the knee;
That her father&#x27;s gracy grace
Might give him a placy place.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Pope&#x27;s poem &quot;The Dunciad&quot; (1728) follows: &quot;Beneath his reign, shall ... Namby Pamby be prefer&#x27;d for Wit!&quot; Gay and Swift also picked up the nickname, which became a general term for affected, weak, and maudlin speech or verse.

In 1718, Philips started a Whig paper, &quot;The Free-Thinker&quot;, in conjunction with Hugh Boulter, then vicar of St Olave&#x27;s, Southwark. Philips had been made justice of the peace for Westminster, and in 1717 a commissioner for the lottery, and when Boulter was made Archbishop of Armagh, Philips accompanied him as secretary. Between 1727 and 1749, he sat in the Irish House of Commons for Armagh Borough, was secretary to the lord chancellor in 1726, and in 1733 became a judge of the prerogative court. His patron died in 1742, and six years later Philips returned to London, where he died on 18 June 1749.

==Works==
His contemporary reputation rested on his pastorals and epistles, particularly the description of winter addressed by him from Copenhagen (1709) to the Earl of Dorset. In T. H. Ward&#x27;s &quot;English Poets&quot;, however, he is represented by two of the simple and charming pieces addressed to the infant children of John Carteret, 2nd Lord Carteret, and of Daniel Pulteney. These were scoffed at by Jonathan Swift, and earned for Philips the nickname of &quot;Namby-Pamby&quot; as described above.

Philips&#x27;s works include an abridgment of Bishop John Hacket&#x27;s &quot;Life of John Williams&quot; (1700); &quot;The Thousand and One Days: Persian Tales&quot; (1722), from the French of F Pétis de la Croix; three plays: &quot;The Distrest Mother&quot; (1712), an adaptation of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Andromaque&quot;; &quot;The Briton&quot; (1722); &quot;Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester&quot; (1723). Many of his poems, which included some translations from Sappho, Anacreon and Pindar, were published separately, and a collected edition appeared in 1748.

<text>François Pétis de la Croix (1653–1713) was a French orientalist.

De la Croix was born in Paris, the son of the Arabic interpreter of the French court and author, also named François Pétis de la Croix (1622–1695) and inherited this office at his father&#x27;s death, afterwards transmitting it to his own son, Alexandre Louis Marie, who also became a notable orientalist. At an early age, de la Croix was sent by Jean-Baptiste Colbert to the Middle East; during the ten years he spent in Syria, Persia and Turkey he learned Arabic, Persian and Turkish and collected materials which he would use in future writings.

==Travel in the Middle East==
In 1670 Pétis de la Croix, age seventeen, travelled to the Middle East on an extended language course as part of a program devised by Colbert to create a pool of capable foreign officials – . After a study period in Aleppo, he arrived in 1674 in Isfahan where he stayed until June 1676. From a short description of his stay we learn of his deep interest in the manners of the &quot;dervish&quot;:

In the same description, Pétis de la Croix tells of a prank played on him by his Agha who during a visit to a Bektashi convent caused him to pose as a shaykh: 
I said them the fatha (first sura of the Qur&#x27;an) over the meat with the usual movements; after the meal I read extensively from the Qur&#x27;an and I chose the chapters dealing with morals and not with Mahomet which I explained according to the commentaries I had read. I also clarified some difficulties they had (...) of course my Agha could not help making a mockery of this; he almost choked laughing and told everyone I had come all the way from France to teach the Asian Muslims the Qur&#x27;an.

Despite the flourishing of Orientalism in France in the 17th century, and despite the fact that Antoine Galland, Barthélemy d&#x27;Herbelot de Molainville and François Pétis de la Croix at one time frequented the Wednesday afternoon discussions – – of Gilles Ménage together, little has remained of the explicit and detailed references to the Masnavi or Sufism in general one could have expected from Pétis de la Croix – or François Bernier for that matter.

One should however keep in mind the real risk run by deviating opinion. It was not until 1682 following the Versailles edict that only the intention to kill with poison and sacrilege coupled with that intention could be withheld as grounds for capital punishment over witchcraft. The proceedings against the Quietists thus only narrowly escaped the greater dangers of the lingering witch craze.

In 1685 concerted Catholic censorship became a matter of State after the edict of Fontainebleau; the opinion had by then developed that there was much resemblance between the Quietism of East and West (see: &quot;Lettre sur le quiétisme des Indes&quot; by François Bernier in &quot;Histoire des Ouvrages des Savans&quot;, Henri Basnage de Beauval (ed.), September 1688).

== Later life ==
He served briefly as secretary to the French ambassador in Morocco, and was interpreter to the French forces sent against Algiers, contributing to the satisfactory settlement of the treaty of peace, which was drawn up by him in Turkish and ratified in 1684. He conducted the negotiations with Tunis and Tripoli in 1685, and those with Morocco in 1687; and in 1692 he was ultimately rewarded with an appointment to the Arabic chair in the Collège de France, which he held until his death in 1713.

== Works ==
He published &quot;Contes Turcs&quot; (Paris, 1707), an &quot;Armenian Dictionary,&quot; and an &quot;Account of Ethiopia&quot;.

He also wrote &quot;The Thousand and One Days&quot; (), a collection of fairy tales based on the model of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. It was published in five volumes between 1710 and 1712. He supposedly translated it from a Persian compilation titled &quot;Hazar u yek ruz&quot; (, ) which he acquired from one &#x27;Dervish Mocles&#x27; or &#x27;Moklas&#x27; in Isfahan in 1675. In fact, it was a very free adaptation of the Turkish &quot;Ferec baʿd eş-şidde&quot; (). The book&#x27;s publisher Barbin asked Alain-René Lesage to rework de la Croix&#x27;s translations into marketable French. Barbin also included two of the stories at the end of the eighth volume of Antoine Galland&#x27;s &quot;Les mille et une nuits&quot; (1709), outraging Galland, who switched publishers for subsequent volumes. Stories from &quot;The Thousand and One Days&quot; inspired other works including Carlo Gozzi&#x27;s &quot;Il re cervo&quot; (&quot;The King Stag&quot;) and &quot;Turandot&quot;.

He edited and published in 1710 his father&#x27;s authoritative biography of Genghis Khan, &quot;History of Genghizcan the Great, First Emperor of the Ancient Moguls and Tartars&quot;, translated into English by Penelope Aubin and published in 1722. This work was popularized in the American colonies by Benjamin Franklin and may have influenced Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom.

His best-known work is his French translation of Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi&#x27;s &quot;Zafarnama&quot;, which was published after Pétis de la Croix&#x27;s death (4 vols., Paris, 1722; Eng. trans. by J Darby, London, 1723). Although the translation is generally well-regarded, Pétis de la Croix erroneously identified Timur himself as the biography&#x27;s sponsor, when in fact the book was commissioned by Timur&#x27;s grandson Ibrahim Sultan.

<text>Robert Stevenson, FRSE, FGS, FRAS, FSA Scot, MWS (8 June 1772 – 12 July 1850) was a Scottish civil engineer, and designer and builder of lighthouses. His works include the Bell Rock Lighthouse.

==Early life==
Robert Stevenson was born in Glasgow. His father was Alan Stevenson, a partner in a West Indies sugar trading house in the city. Alan died of an epidemic fever on the island of St. Christopher in the West Indies on 26 May 1774, a few days before Robert&#x27;s second birthday. Robert&#x27;s uncle died of the same disease around the same time. Since this left Alan&#x27;s widow, Jean Lillie Stevenson, in much-reduced financial circumstances, Robert was educated, as a young child, at a charity school.

Robert&#x27;s mother intended him to join the ministry, so when he was a bit older she enrolled him in the school of a locally famous Glasgow linguist, a Mr Macintyre. But when Robert was 15, she remarried and the family moved to 1 Blair Street, off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Robert&#x27;s new stepfather was Thomas Smith, a tinsmith, lamp maker, ingenious mechanic, and civil engineer, who had been appointed to the newly formed Northern Lighthouse Board in 1786.

In 1798 or 1799, when Robert was about 26, the family moved to a newly built home, 2 Baxters Place, at the head of Leith Walk.

In 1815, Robert&#x27;s stepfather died, and Robert inherited the house, where he continued to live until about 1820.

==Professional career==

Stevenson served as an apprentice civil engineer to his stepfather, Thomas Smith. He was so successful at it that, at age 19, he was given responsibility for supervising the erection of a lighthouse on Little Cumbrae island in the River Clyde. His next project was overseeing the building of lighthouses on Orkney. While working on these projects, he continued his civil engineering studies: He diligently practised surveying and architectural drawing, and attended maths and physics lectures at the Andersonian Institute in Glasgow. 

In the winter, when it was too chilly for construction work, he attended lectures at the University of Edinburgh in philosophy, mathematics, chemistry, natural history, moral philosophy, logic, and agriculture. He was not granted a degree because he did not have the proficiency in Latin or Greek that was a requirement for a degree in those days.

In 1797, he was appointed engineer to the Lighthouse Board, succeeding to his stepfather&#x27;s place there. In 1799, he married Smith&#x27;s eldest daughter Jean, who was also his stepsister, and, in 1800, Smith made him his business partner.

The most important work of Stevenson&#x27;s life was the Bell Rock Lighthouse, built between 1807 and 1810 when he was in his mid-30s. The lighthouse still stands today. Its construction was a scheme long in the gestation, and then long (and extremely hazardous) in the construction. Its structure was based upon the design of the Eddystone Lighthouse, which had been built by John Smeaton — but Stevenson made several improvements to that design. John Rennie was a consulting engineer on the project. After the project was complete, there was some contention as to who should get more credit—Rennie or Stevenson. That contention grew particularly strong as between the two men&#x27;s sons when they were older - Robert&#x27;s son Alan Stevenson and John Rennie&#x27;s son, Sir John Rennie. Samuel Smiles, a popular engineering author of the time, published an account taken from Rennie, which gave prominence to Rennie&#x27;s claim. However, the Northern Lighthouse Board gave full credit to Stevenson, as have historians since then.

Stevenson&#x27;s work on the Bell Rock and elsewhere provided a fund of anecdotes about the dangers he tended to place himself in and his lucky narrow escapes. For example, in 1794, he was aboard the sloop &quot;Elizabeth of Stromness&quot;, returning from the Orkney Islands, when it became becalmed off Kinnaird Head. Unlike others aboard the ship, he had the good fortune to be taken off it and rowed ashore. After he left it, a gale arose and drove the ship back to Orkney, where it foundered: All aboard were drowned. Another time, he was with a crew of men on the Bell Rock, which was only above the surface of the water at the lowest tide, when one of the crew boats drifted away. The remaining boats did not have enough room to carry everyone back to the mainland. Once the tide rose, the rock would have been submerged, and anyone not in a boat would have been stranded in the water. Luckily, before the tide rose, the Bell Rock pilot boat happened to arrive on an errand to deliver some mail to Stevenson, and thus saved the situation.

Stevenson served as the engineer to the Northern Lighthouse Board until 1842 - nearly fifty years. During that time he designed numerous lighthouses and oversaw their construction and the addition of later improvements to them. His many innovations included his choice of light sources and mountings, his reflector design, his use of Fresnel lenses, and his use of rotation and shuttering systems that provided lighthouses with individual signatures (characteristics) — allowing them to be identified by seafarers. For this latter innovation, he was awarded a gold medal by King William I of the Netherlands.

Engineering skills were in high demand after the Battle of Waterloo, which marked the end of the continental wars, as the focus turned toward improving the country&#x27;s infrastructure. So Stevenson was kept busy. In addition to his work for the Northern Lighthouse Board, he served as a consulting engineer on many projects, collaborating with other engineers such as John Rennie, Alexander Nimmo, Thomas Telford, William Walker, Archibald Elliot, and William Cubitt. These projects included the construction of roads, bridges, harbours, canals, railways, and aids to river navigation. He designed and oversaw the construction in Glasgow of the Hutcheson Bridge, and in Edinburgh of the Regent Bridge and approaches to it from the east. He also produced a number of designs for canals and railways which were not built, and new and improved designs for bridges, some of which were later implemented by his successors. He invented the movable jib and the balance crane as necessary aids to lighthouse construction, and, as George Stephenson noted, he led the trend toward using malleable rather than cast-iron rails in the construction of railways.

In 1815, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Barclay, John Playfair and David Brewster.

In 1824, he published a paper about the condition of the eastern coastline of the United Kingdom, entitled &quot;Account of the Bell Rock Lighthouse&quot;. In it, he presented convincing evidence that the North Sea was eroding that coastline, and in particular that the great sandbanks were disappearing — the spoils taken by the sea. He hypothesized that freshwater and saltwater areas at river mouths exist as separate and distinct streams, and carried out tests of this hypothesis. He contributed articles to the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Edinburgh Encyclopædia, and published papers in a number of scientific journals.

He was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Family life==

In 1799, Robert married his stepsister, Jean Smith, who was his stepfather Thomas Smith&#x27;s eldest daughter by his first wife. A number of their children died young, including three who died of childhood diseases early in 1808, during the construction of Bell Rock.
Three of Stevenson&#x27;s sons became engineers: Alan, David and Thomas. Robert&#x27;s other surviving child was Jane (1801–1864). Jane became her father&#x27;s secretary and helped him write and illustrate his account of the Bell Rock Lighthouse construction. He had two grandchildren who became well-known: His son Alan was the father of the author and journalist Katharine de Mattos, and his son Thomas was the father of the author Robert Louis Stevenson.

Stevenson lived in Baxter&#x27;s Place at the head of Leith Walk for most of his later years, moving from No. 2 to the far larger No. 1 around 1820. In 1985, the building was named &quot;Robert Stevenson House&quot; in his honour. It was used as an office from 1985 to 2015. The building was converted into a Marriott Hotel in 2017, at which point the name was removed.

Stevenson died on 12 July 1850, at 1 Baxters Place in Edinburgh. He is buried in the Stevenson family plot in the New Calton Burial Ground.

==Memorials to Stevenson==
Stevenson College, Edinburgh, named after Robert Stevenson, was founded in 1970. For a good portion of his life, Stevenson lived at 1 Baxter&#x27;s Place, Edinburgh. In 1985, the building was named “Robert Stevenson House” in his memory. (The name was removed in 2015 because Marriott bought the building to convert it to a hotel.) 

Robert and his father, Alan, are memorialized on the gravestone of his grandfather, a Glasgow merchant — also named Robert Stevenson - who died in 1764 and was buried in the churchyard of Glasgow Cathedral.

<text>George Mitchell (27 February 1917 – 27 August 2002) was a Scottish musician, best known for having devised the long-running &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot;.

== Biography ==
He was born in Falkirk, Scotland. Mitchell&#x27;s grandfather was well-known Scottish choir master John Laing, and both of his parents were amateur singers. He was educated at Southgate County School in North London. Mitchell was an accountant before his World War II military service. During the war, he served with the Royal Army Pay Corps at Finsbury Circus. This posting enabled him to organise choirs within the armed forces and put on shows at the Cripplegate Theatre, among others. This led to appearances on many BBC Radio shows.

The choir continued after the war, and soon no radio programme was complete without its quota of Mitchell Singers, often performing under different names. Given their own radio show in 1950, the George Mitchell Glee Club, George and his singers continued to perform in hundreds of radio and stage shows and appeared in several films. They also had several hit records. In 1957, the George Mitchell Minstrels first appeared at the annual Earl&#x27;s Court Radio Show, a programme which was televised. From 1958, the Minstrels, in red make-up which looked black on camera, became an enormous hit, with a peak viewing audience of 16.5 million viewers in 1964. It won the Golden Rose of Montreux for Best TV Show in the World in 1961.

The show appeared in a prime-time television slot for twenty years, as well as spawning two touring stage shows, one in the UK and one in Australia, and a permanent one in London which ran from 1962 until 1972 at the Victoria Palace Theatre, with a further year at the New Victoria. During the 1970s, the television show&#x27;s popularity declined, partly because of the style of music becoming dated, and partly because of an increase in racial awareness. It was axed by the BBC after several unsuccessful attempts to change the format. The final episode was broadcast in 1978.

Mitchell was awarded the OBE in 1975.

<text>John Hacket (Born Halket) (1 September 1592 – 28 October 1670) was an English churchman, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry from 1661 until his death.

==Life==

He was born in London and educated at Westminster and Trinity College, Cambridge. On taking his degree he was elected a fellow of his college, and soon afterwards wrote the comedy, &quot;Loiola&quot; (London, 1648), which was twice performed before King James I. He was ordained in 1618, and through the influence of John Williams became rector in 1621 of Stoke Hammond, Buckinghamshire, and Kirkby Underwood, Lincolnshire.

In 1623 he was chaplain to James, and in 1624 Williams gave him the livings of St Andrew&#x27;s, Holborn in London, and Cheam, Surrey. He was Archdeacon of Bedford from 1631 to 1661.

When the so-called Root and Branch Bill was before Parliament in 1641, Hacket was selected to plead in the House of Commons for the continuance of cathedral establishments. In 1645 his living of St Andrew&#x27;s was sequestered, but he was allowed to retain the other, ceding it for practical reasons in 1662.

On the accession of Charles II, his fortunes improved; he frequently preached before the king, and was elected Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry after the bishopric was rejected by the Presbyterian leader Edmund Calamy the elder. Hacket was elected to the See on 6 December, confirmed on 20 December, and consecrated a bishop on 22 December 1661. His time at the Cathedral coming immediately after the English Civil War meant that Hacket had the unenviable task of overseeing the restoration of Lichfield Cathedral.

He has a near life-size effigy at rest over marble plaques in Lichfield Cathedral.

==Works==

His best-known book is the biography of his patron, Archbishop Williams, entitled &quot;Scrinia reserata: a Memorial offered to the great Deservings of John Williams, D.D.&quot; (London, 1693).

<text>Wong Tai Sin or Huang Daxian () is a Chinese Taoist deity popular in Jinhua, Zhejiang, and Hong Kong with the power of healing. The name, meaning the &quot;Great Immortal Wong (Huang)&quot;, is the divine form of Huang Chuping or Wong Cho Ping (; c. 328 – c. 386), a Taoist hermit from Jinhua during the Eastern Jin dynasty.

==Legend==

According to the text &quot;Self-Description of Chisongzi&quot; (; &quot;Master Red Pine&quot;), Wong Tai Sin was born Huang Chuping (Wong Cho Ping in Cantonese) in 328 in Lanxi, Jinhua, Zhejiang province. Western sources have him listed at c. 284 to 364 CE.

Wong Cho Ping is said to have experienced poverty and hunger, becoming a shepherd when he was eight years old. He began practising Taoism at the age of fifteen after meeting an immortal or saintly person on Red Pine Mountain in his hometown. Legend has it that he was able to transform stones into sheep forty years later. Wong Tai Sin later became known as the Red Pine Immortal (), after the mountain where he had his hermitage, and his birthday is celebrated on the 23rd of the eighth lunar month.

==Influence in Hong Kong==

Today, Sik Sik Yuen is an educational and charitable foundation that, true to Leung&#x27;s origins as a healer, runs a free clinic and a number of schools and colleges. In Hong Kong, the Wong Tai Sin area and Wong Tai Sin district are named after the deity. There is also one MTR station that is named as Wong Tai Sin station. Many worshippers and tourists from all over the world visit Wong Tai Sin Temple everyday.

==In popular culture==
*Adam Cheng has the role of the TVB&#x27;s tv series, The Legend of Wong Tai Sin in the eighties.
*Lam Ching Ying is another role for the movie of TVB&#x27;s same title in 1992, depicting the life story of Wong Tai Sin.

<text>Pub tokens or tavern tokens (as they are known in Great Britain and Ireland) or bar tokens or [[Voucher|chit]]s (United States usage) are a form of exonumia used in drinking establishments.

==Usage==
In Great Britain, Ireland and the US, during the 17th to 20th centuries, public houses sometimes issued tokens which could be used in payment for future drinks. These tokens were sometimes used in small, family bars where patrons knew each other. They were also used in saloons and hotel bars. When buying a round of drinks for friends, the bartender would give a token to those patrons already having a drink, and collect the full sum from the round-buyer. The owner would collect immediately, and the drinkers would have a token for later use. As the token cost less to produce than the value of the drink, there was a significant profit to the bar owner. Sometimes, drinkers would take the token home, and forget to bring them back. This has been cited as the reason bar owners loved tokens, and they were found in virtually every drinking establishment.

Tokens were also used as change, where the price of the drink was odd. For example, in America for many years, drinks were two for 25 cents, or one bit (12.5 cents) each. Thus tokens exist with one-bit denominations.

The early tokens were usually made of brass or aluminum and would have the name or initials of the pub on them, so that they could not be used anywhere else. Often, they had the landlord&#x27;s name on them as well. This ensured that, when the pub changed hands, the new landlord would not have to honor old tokens. Many small, family bars still use tokens today, but modern tokens are generally made of plastic (brass and aluminum tokens are still made, but as they are more expensive, are less used). Many tokens only had names or initials, and are known as mavericks, as their location is often unknown. Token researchers spend many hours attempting to identify maverick tokens to a specific location, as attributed tokens are therefore desired by collectors of that town. Unidentified maverick tokens are worth minimal sums, where some identified tokens can be worth up to hundreds of dollars.

Books on pub or bar tokens are generally by country or state. Not all states have been researched, and some state catalogs are out of print.

<doc id="375445" wikidata="Q7551489" url="?curid=375445" title="Socialism in New Zealand">
<text>Socialism in New Zealand had little traction in early colonial New Zealand but developed as a political movement around the beginning of the 20th century. Much of socialism&#x27;s early growth was found in the labour movement.

The extent to which socialism plays a part in modern New Zealand politics depends on which definitions of socialist are used, but few mainstream politicians would describe themselves using the word &quot;socialist&quot;. The term &quot;social-democrat&quot; is more common, but the general &quot;left-wing&quot; or &quot;centre-left&quot; are used far more frequently. New Zealand has a complicated assortment of socialist causes and organisations. Some of these play a considerable role in public activism, such as the anti-war movement; other groups are strongly committed to socialist revolution.

Several prominent political parties in New Zealand, such as the New Zealand Labour Party, have historical links to socialism but are not generally considered socialist today due to their acceptance of a capitalist economy. More likely to receive this label are the small Marxist organisations that exist outside the political mainstream, such as Organise Aotearoa, the International Socialist Organisation, Socialist Aotearoa.

==History of New Zealand socialism==

Academic Josephine F. Milburn argues that socialist theories were introduced by immigrant workers with experience in the British labour movement. Their ideas were not widely accepted, however. The Liberal Government of New Zealand that was dominant 1891–1912 rejected socialism but it supported unions, and the government built the foundations of the country&#x27;s welfare state in the 1890s and fought the large landholders. Milburn argues that governmental activism cannot be attributed to the influence of the small socialist movement.

===Unions and workers&#x27; parties===

Ideological socialism, when it arrived, mostly stemmed from Britain or other British colonies. Much of socialism&#x27;s early growth was found in the labour movement, and often coincided with the growth of trade unions. During the 1870s, James McPherson and his Canterbury Working Men&#x27;s Mutual Protection Society had written to Karl Marx, requesting affiliation with the First International. The New Zealand Federation of Labour (also known as the &quot;Red Federation&quot;) was influenced by socialist theories, as were many other labour organizations. The Red Federation was formed in 1909 when a federation of the mining unions invited other unions to join a New Zealand Federation of Labour. The Red Federation&#x27;s official organ was the &quot;Maoriland Worker&quot;, which advocated militant unionism and socialism. Key Red Federation leaders included the Australian–born Hickey and Paddy Webb, and fellow Australian Bob Semple. In opposition to the Red Federation, mainstream trade and labour councils formed a rival Federation of Labour.

The arrival of 200 British socialists called the &quot;Clarion Settlers&quot; led to the formation of the New Zealand Socialist Party in 1901, which promoted the works of Marx and Friedrich Engels. Strongly influenced by the British Independent Labour Party, the Socialist Party advocated promoting socialism through education and agitation rather than elections. The group met with little tangible success, but it nevertheless had considerable impact on the development of New Zealand socialism, forging close ties with the &quot;Red Federation.&quot; In particular, Edward Hunter (sometimes known under the pen name &quot;Billy Banjo&quot;, and a member of both the Socialist Party and the Red Federation), was a major figure in the spread of socialist ideas to the unions.

In the years leading up to the First World War, several New Zealand and Australian socialists including Harry Holland, Michael Joseph Savage, Peter Fraser, Harry Scott Bennett, Tom Barker, Tom Bloodworth, and Bob Semple advocated the creation of a &quot;Cooperative Commonwealth&quot; in which all land and means of wealth production, distribution, and management would be owned and managed collectively by the people. Besides Marx and Engels, these antipodean socialists were influenced by various radical European and American writers including Henry George, Edward Bellamy, Georges Sorel, August Bebel, Eugene Debs, Bill Haywood, and Irving Fisher. In 1912, a Petone Marxian Club was formed and met every Monday. This was one of the forerunners to the New Zealand Marxian Association.

The growth of unionism eventually led to the establishment of a number of socialist-influenced parties. Originally, the working class vote was concentrated mainly with the Liberal Party, where a number of prominent left-wing politicians (such as Frederick Pirani) emerged. Later, however, there were increasing calls for an independent workers&#x27; party, particularly as the Liberals began to lose their reformist drive.

The second organised party to gain a seat in Parliament (after the Liberal Party) was the small Independent Political Labour League, which won an urban electorate in Wellington in the 1908 election. Later, in 1910, the IPLL was reformed as the Labour Party (not to be confused with the modern party).

===Emergence of the Labour Party===

The growing drive for unity among left-wing groups resulted in a &quot;Unity Conference&quot; being called in 1912. This conference aimed to merge the various left-wing parties in New Zealand, including both the moderate Labour Party and the hardline Socialist Party. The Socialist Party, however, refused to attend the conference, and the new United Labour Party consisted only of the Labour Party and a number of independent campaigners.

Premier William Massey&#x27;s &quot;heavy-handed&quot; suppression of the Waihi miners&#x27; strike prompted another attempt at unity in 1913. This time, the Socialists were willing to attend. A new group, the Social Democratic Party, was formed, merging the United Labour Party and the Socialist Party. A faction of the United Labour Party refused to accept the decision, however, and continued on under the same name. Later, a decision by the Social Democrats to support a strike of dockworkers and coal miners resulted in a number of Social Democratic leaders being arrested, leaving the party in disarray in the 1914 election, the remnants of the United Labour Party actually won more seats than the &quot;united&quot; Social Democrats.

Finally, in 1916, it was agreed that the Social Democrats and the United Labour Party remnants would all be amalgamated into a single group, the New Zealand Labour Party. The new Labour Party was explicitly socialist, and was based around goals of redistribution of wealth, nationalization of industry, and elimination of conscription. Eventual Labour Party leader, Harry Holland, was strongly socialist in his beliefs, having been associated with the Socialist Party and with the striking miners in Waihi. Holland believed that the militancy at Waihi was a sign of further impending class conflict. While the Labour Party gained some electoral success, it continued to trail the Liberal Party and the Reform Party until the replacement of Holland with Michael Joseph Savage. Savage, although also involved in the earlier Socialist Party, was more moderate than Holland, and Labour gained considerable support. Assisted by the Great Depression, Labour won a decisive victory in the 1935 election.

===Labour&#x27;s social democracy===
Despite its socialist roots, the Labour Party shifted towards a more social democratic orientation once in power. The First Labour Government led by Savage and Peter Fraser implemented a range of socialist policies such as nationalising industry, broadcasting, transportation, and a Keynesian welfare state. However, the party did not seek to abolish capitalism, instead opting for a mixed economy. Labour&#x27;s welfare state and mixed economy were not challenged until the 1980s.
Two years after the Labour Party lost the 1949 election, the goal of implementing &quot;the socialisation of the means of production, distribution, and exchange&quot; was removed from the party&#x27;s policy platform. This is sometimes seen as the end of any real claim to full socialism by the Labour Party. However, the shift away from socialism had not come about without dispute. Labour Party politician John A. Lee was harshly critical of the changes, and had eventually left to establish the Democratic Labour Party in 1940. The party was considerably more socialist than Labour, but performed poorly. Many members eventually left the party, mostly due to Lee&#x27;s perceived autocratic style.

During the 1980s, the Fourth Labour Government under Prime Minister David Lange and Finance Minister Roger Douglas implemented several neoliberal economic reforms known as Rogernomics which transitioned New Zealand&#x27;s Keynesian economy towards a more free market model. Labour&#x27;s abandonment of its traditional values fractured the party, leading disaffected members to join Jim Anderton&#x27;s NewLabour Party, Greens, New Zealand Democratic Party for Social Credit, and the Mana Motuhake parties under the Alliance. Successive Labour governments have promoted centre-left social and economic policies while preserving a free market economy. The former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern identifies as a social democrat and formerly served as President of the International Union of Socialist Youth.
===Rise of the Communist Party===

Even before Holland&#x27;s replacement, and especially after Labour&#x27;s 1949 policy change, many people had come to the conclusion that the Labour Party had moved too far away from its socialist roots. Only two years after Labour&#x27;s foundation, the New Zealand Marxian Association was established. The Marxian Association was inspired by the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB) and focused on political action. It would later clash acrimoniously with Holland. The Marxian Association itself would fall prey to internal division in 1921. That year, a number of members who supported the Russian Revolution departed to form the Communist Party of New Zealand (CPNZ). They were joined by two other revolutionary strands within the New Zealand Socialist Party: the De Lonites who espoused revolutionary politics and industrial unionism; and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)-syndicalist tradition who advocated direct action and spurned political activity.

In 1930, however, former members of the Marxian Association (backed by members of the Socialist Party of Australia (WSM)) established the Socialist Party of New Zealand (distinct from the earlier New Zealand Socialist Party). This group denied that the Labour Party (or even any of the parties before it, except for the Marxian Association) represented genuine socialism. The new Socialist Party still exists today, although has slightly modified its name, becoming the World Socialist Party).

Meanwhile, the CPNZ built its support from miners in the South Island&#x27;s West Coast and Huntly in the North Island&#x27;s Waikato district, and from seamen and waterside workers. The party faithfully followed the official position of the Soviet Union, modelling its aims, beliefs, manifesto and organisational structure and processes on those of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). The Soviets also sought to guide international Communist parties through the Third International or Comintern. In addition, the CPNZ also maintained close ties with the Communist Party of Australia (CPA) and supported Maori rights and the Mau movement in Western Samoa.

During the 1920s, the CPNZ and the Communist front organisation NZ-USSR Society attempted to influence the New Zealand trade union movement, workers, intellectuals and the New Zealand Labour Party to promote support for the Soviet Union and socialist policies. These attempts were largely unsuccessful and the Labour Party adopted a policy excluding all members of the CPNZ and Communist front organisations. This set the stage for enmity and rivalry between communists and social democratic parties over control of the trade unions and unemployed workers&#x27; movements during the Great Depression. Both communists and social democrats however did work together during the 1930s to combat fascism.

===Communist offshoots===
When the Sino-Soviet split occurred in the 1960s, the CPNZ was sharply divided between supporters of the Soviet Union (led by the &quot;revisionist&quot; Nikita Khrushchev) and supporters of China (led by the radical Mao Zedong). Eventually, the Maoists led by Vic Wilcox triumphed, and supporters of Khrushchev were expelled. Under Wilcox&#x27;s leadership, the CPNZ was the only Western Communist party to side with China against the Soviets. The CPNZ&#x27;s official mouthpiece was the &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot;.

The expelled members led by Ken Douglas and George Harold (Bill) Andersen eventually established the Socialist Unity Party (SUP). The SUP supported the CPSU and Soviet Union until the collapse of the USSR in 1991, defending the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, the suppression of the 1982 Solidarity demonstrations in Poland, and the Soviet–Afghan War. In return, Moscow funded frequent trips by SUP members to Russia, and Soviet ideologues and advisers regularly visited their SUP counterparts in New Zealand. The SUP&#x27;s newspaper was called &quot;NZ Tribune&quot;. The Socialist Unity party eventually suffered its own split, with some members departing to found the modern Socialist Party of Aotearoa.

In 1969, a group called the Socialist Action League (now the Communist League) was established. The League emerged from student protests against the Vietnam War and was influenced by the theories of Leon Trotsky, Fidel Castro, and Che Guevera. The League took an interest in Communist movements in Cuba, Nicaragua, and the Philippines. Its newspaper was called &quot;Socialist Action&quot;. The League has proven to be one of the more durable parties and contested the 2017 Mount Albert by-election. Green Member of Parliament Keith Locke was once involved in the Socialist Action League.

After Mao&#x27;s death, the CPNZ under the leadership of Richard Wolf and Harold Crook rejected the reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping. Instead, they followed Albania, which was led by Enver Hoxha&#x27;s Party of Labour of Albania. The leadership of the party believed that Hoxha was the only communist leader to keep &quot;real&quot; communism, but the group&#x27;s determination to follow the narrowest path available alienated many of its supporters. The party gradually declined. Those CPNZ members who remained loyal to Beijing formed the Workers&#x27; Communist League, whose newspaper was called &quot;Unity&quot;.

During the Cold War, the CPNZ, SUP, Workers Communist League and the Socialist Action League tried to influence the Labour Party, trade unions, and a range of popular issues like the anti-Springbok tour protests, the Māori biculturalism, and the anti-nuclear movement.

Following the collapse of Albanian communism, the CPNZ adopted the Trotskyism it had once harshly condemned, and merged with a newer group known as the International Socialist Organization. The resultant party was called the Socialist Workers Organization. Later, however, many supporters of the International Socialist Organization withdrew from the new party, reestablishing their old group. As such, some see the Socialist Workers Organization (SWO) as a continuation of the old Communist Party. The SWO, known then as Socialist Worker, voted to dissolve itself in January 2012.

Other groups continue to promote socialism as well. In the 2002 election, four candidates were put forward an umbrella group (known as the Anti-Capitalist Alliance) consisting of the Workers Party of New Zealand, the Revolution group, and other left-wing activists. The International Socialist Organization is also active at some universities.

===New Left variations===

The New Left in New Zealand emerged during the 1950s and 1960s in response to the perceived &quot;authoritarian, bureaucratic, and repressive norms&quot; of New Zealand society and the so-called conservatism of the Communist Party, Labour, and National parties. Eschewing the hierarchical structures of the &quot;Old Left&quot; political parties, the New Left developed informal groups that were non-sectarian, anti-bureaucratic, and decentralised. While the &quot;Old Left&quot; viewed the working class as the agent of revolutionary change, the New Left also saw revolutionary potential in Third World peasants, students, ethnic minorities and other marginalised groups. As with their New Left counterparts in Europe and North America, the New Left in New Zealand was largely young, white, male, middle-class, student-dominated, and incorporated a wide range of beliefs including the counter-culture movement, Christian pacifism, anarchism, neo-Leninism, and libertarian forms of Marxism. According to Boraman, the New Zealand New Left combined both the socialist orientation of the European New Left and the liberal orientation of its American counterpart.

New Left groups championed several causes included opposition to racism, the nuclear arms race, and the Vietnam War. Key New Left organisations in New Zealand were the anti-apartheid Halt All Racist Tours (HART), the Progressive Youth Movement (PYM), Socialist Forum, and the Resistance bookshops; which were organised locally. Unlike the Australian and American New Left groups, the Socialist Forum, PYM groups, and the Resistance bookshops were not university-based organisations but largely drew their support from working-class youth. The Wellington PYM consisted of a mixture of working-class youth and university students. Like the American New Left, the various PYM groups opposed the Vietnam War, racism, and Apartheid. While the New Zealand Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) was not a New Left organisation, several New Leftists including Graham Butterworth, Jim Delahunty, and Helmut Eionhorn of Wellington Socialist Forum also participated in the CND.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the New Left reached its heyday. HART, the PYM, and Resistance bookshops were joined by other groups including the Auckland University Society for the Active Prevention of Cruelty to Politically Apathetic Humans (AUSAPOCHPAH), the Auckland-based Friends of Brutus, the New Left Club at Massey University, the Victoria University Socialist Club, the Anarchist Congress in Wellington, the Radical Student&#x27;s Alliance at the University of Canterbury, the Christchurch-based Anarchist Commune, the University of Otago&#x27;s Progressive Left Club, and the Dunedin Anarchist Army. The activist, scholar, and Green Party Member of Parliament Sue Bradford was involved in the Auckland PYM and the Auckland Resistance bookshop.

Following the election of the Third Labour Government in 1972, the new government delivered many of the New Left&#x27;s demands including withdrawing New Zealand troops from Vietnam in 1972; ending compulsory military training that same year; and terminating sporting contact with South Africa. As a result, the New Left lost much of its prominence due to the winding down of the protest movement. While New Leftists were still active in radical politics such as the Resistance bookshops, the more liberal wing of the protest movement had largely been appeased by the Third Labour Government&#x27;s policies.

During the early to mid 1970s, some New Left elements like the Christchurch PYM became influenced by the Maoist Communist Party. One New Left group that emerged in 1974 was Murray Horton and Owen Wilkes&#x27; Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa, which campaigned against foreign military bases and economic activity in New Zealand. According to Boraman, several New Leftists including former PYM members were also instrumental in founding several social movement organisations during the 1960s and 1970s including Tama Poata&#x27;s Māori Organisation on Human Rights (MOOHR), the Black Panthers–inspired Polynesian Panthers, Therese O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s Wellington Women&#x27;s Liberation Front, the Auckland Women&#x27;s Liberation Front, and the Auckland–based Women for Equality. Boraman has characterized opposition to American imperialism and uncritical praise for Communist states and figures like Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh, and Che Guevara as two key defining features of the later New Left activists and groups.

===Left-wing alternative media===

During the early 20th century, the emergence of working-class consciousness led to the formation of several left-wing newspapers including &quot;The Maoriland Worker&quot; (1910–1924), &quot;The Weekly Herald&quot;, &quot;The Transport Worker&quot;, and &quot;The New Zealand Watersider&quot;. During the 1930s, they were joined by activist theatre companies, politically-engaged literary magazines, the Left Book Club, the Co-Operative Book Movement, and the Progressive Publishing Company. During the Great Depression, liberal-left perspectives penetrated mainstream New Zealand society through churches, women&#x27;s groups, populist radio programmes, and the Labour Party.

The &quot;Maoriland Worker&quot; later revamped itself as the &quot;New Zealand Worker&quot; (1924–1935) and as the Labour Party&#x27;s affiliated newspaper &quot;The Standard&quot; (1935–1959). While it was sympathetic to the Labour Party, the &quot;Maoriland Worker&quot; was a largely radical socialist publication that was independent of the Labour Party. The various Communist parties also published their own newspapers. The CPNZ&#x27;s official organ was the &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot; (1939–1991), which reached a peak of 14,000 copies in 1945. The Socialist Unity Party&#x27;s newspapers were the &quot;Tribune&quot; (1966–1995), &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; (1994–2005), &quot;The Spark&quot; (1991–2013), and &quot;Socialist Review&quot; (1997–present), and &quot;The Spark&quot; successor &quot;Fightback&quot; (2013–present). The Socialist Action League&#x27;s newspaper was &quot;Socialist Action&quot; (1969–1998), which reached a peak of 8,400 copies during the 1978 general election. The Workers&#x27; Communist League&#x27;s newspaper was called &quot;Unity&quot; (1978–1990).

Several notable independent socialist magazines and newspapers in New Zealand have included the &quot;New Zealand Monthly Review&quot; (&quot;NZMR&quot;, 1960–1996), &quot;The Republican&quot; (1974–1996), &quot;Race Gender Class&quot; (1985–1992), left-wing journalist Chris Trotter&#x27;s social democratic &quot;New Zealand Political Review&quot; (&quot;NZPR&quot;, 1992–2005), the feminist &quot;Broadsheet&quot; (1972–1997), the Peace Movement Aotearoa&#x27;s &quot;Peacelink&quot;, the queer feminist &quot;Bitches, Witches and Dykes&quot;, the anti-apartheid &quot;HART News&quot;, &quot;CARP Newsletter&quot;, &quot;Foreign Control Watchdog&quot;, and &quot;Peace Researcher&quot;. Other independent left-wing publications have included the Marxist Publishing Group&#x27;s &quot;Red Papers&quot; (1976–1979), &quot;The Paper&quot; (1973–1975), and the Victoria University Socialist Club&#x27;s &quot;Red Spark&quot; (1969–1970).

==Contemporary socialist parties, groups, and media in New Zealand==
There are around twenty political parties or organizations in New Zealand which follow socialist or communist policies. It is often difficult to gain a clear picture of socialist parties in New Zealand - mergers, splits, and re-namings leave the situation confused. In 2019 only Organise Aotearoa, the International Socialist Organisation, Socialist Aotearoa, the Canterbury Socialist Society, and the Communist Party of Aotearoa hold regular public meetings and maintain regularly updated websites.

===Modern parties and organizations===
*New Zealand Federation of Socialist Societies - a Non Sectarian Socialist organization focused on the educational advancement of Socialism and political engagement in the long term.
* Communist League - a Trotskyist group established in 1969 as the &quot;Socialist Action League&quot;. It has links to the Socialist Workers Party of the US. The Communist League had two candidates in the 2002 election, but neither won their respective races. The League also stood candidates in the 2010 Auckland council election.
*Communist Party of Aotearoa (2019) - a democratic socialist group based in Wellington with smaller branches around the country. Operates the Workers&#x27; Star newspaper and website. The main outlets of party work are the Hospo Workers Union and the Aotearoa Community Union. Originally known as the New Communist Party of Aotearoa.
*Communist Workers&#x27; Group - a Trotskyist group. It was established in 1995 as a splinter group from the Workers&#x27; Power organization. It is associated with the global Liaison Committee of Militants for a Revolutionary Communist International alliance, which itself was a split from the global alliance that Workers&#x27; Power belonged to. Their website is redrave.blogspot.co.nz.
* Fightback - formerly the Workers Party, which was previously the Anti-Capitalist Alliance. Branches in Wellington and Auckland and a monthly publication. Some members have worked as organisers for Unite Union. Fightback publishes a monthly magazine by the same name.
*International Socialist Organization - a revolutionary Trotskyist group that is particularly active in universities. It briefly attempted to merge with the remnants of the Communist Party of New Zealand, forming the Socialist Workers Organization. However, the majority of the group eventually rejected this decision and reestablished their own party but were now outside of the International Socialist Tendency. The ISO has fraternal relations with Socialist Alternative, in Australia, and the International Socialist Organisation, US. Branches in Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin. Bi-monthly magazine called Socialist Review. 
*Organise Aotearoa – a revolutionary socialist group formed in 2016 and widely publicised in October 2018. Shortly after its public announcement, the organisation engaged in a series of direct action campaigns, including joining the blockade of New Zealand Defence Industry Association forums, occupying the Brazilian embassy after the inauguration of Jair Bolsonaro, occupying the United States consulate in Auckland during the 2019 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état attempt, and joining the occupation of Ihumātao. The group has also organised broader mobilisations such as the 2018 protests agitating for abortion reform. As of June 2019, the organisation claims a membership of 272 active members. Branches in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, and Dunedin.
*Permanent Revolution Group - a Trotskyist group established as a breakaway from the Spartacist League (which later became the Workers&#x27; Power organization). It is associated with the International Bolshevik Tendency.
*Socialist Aotearoa - an Auckland-based group formed in May 2008 which split from Socialist Worker (Aotearoa) over disagreement with the organization&#x27;s participation in the Residents Action Movement electoral coalition. The group has an eclectic mix of Trotskyists, anarchists, ecosocialists and various other ideologies in its ranks. Members are active in Unite Union, with one member, Joe Carolan, a senior organiser in that union.
* Socialist Voice - a Trotskyist group established in 2002. It is associated with the Committee for a Workers&#x27; International, and is therefore linked to the Socialist Party of England and Wales.
*Socialist Party of Aotearoa - a Marxist-Leninist group. It was founded in 1990 as a split from the Socialist Unity Party, which was itself a split from the Communist Party of New Zealand.
*Communist Party of Aotearoa - A Marxist-Leninist party founded in 2018 in Auckland. The party seeks to establish Socialism and create a sustainable environment.

===Defunct parties and organizations===

*New Zealand Socialist Party (1901–1913) - an organization established in 1901. Not to be confused with the Socialist Party of New Zealand, a completely separate organization which is now known as the World Socialist Party.
* Communist Party of New Zealand (1921–1994) - an old communist group that initially gained a modest measure of success, but which later declined. The party became attached to Stalinism, and when the Sino-Soviet split occurred, the party adopted Maoism. Later, after Mao&#x27;s death, it followed Enver Hoxha, leader of Albania (which they considered to be the last bastion of true communism). After the fall of Albania, the party renounced all these ideologies and adopted Trotskyism. The party then attempted a merger with the International Socialist Organization, creating the Socialist Workers Organization. Most of the International Socialists eventually withdrew from this coalition, leaving the new Socialist Workers Organization dominated by the former Communist Party.
* World Socialist Party (1930–??) - a group based primarily around opposition to Leninism. It was originally established in 1930 simply as the &quot;Socialist Party of New Zealand&quot;, but later added &quot;world&quot; to its name. It is affiliated with the World Socialist Movement.
*Socialist Unity Party (1966–1990) - a pro-Soviet party established by expelled members of the Communist Party. The Communist Party had been split between supporters of the Soviet Union and supporters of Mao Zedong&#x27;s China, and the pro-Soviet faction eventually lost. The Socialist Unity party survived until relatively recently, and maintained a relatively high level of influence in the trade union movement.
* Socialist Worker (Aotearoa) (?–2012). A revolutionary socialist group aligned with the International Socialist Tendency. Formerly known as the Socialist Workers Organisation, the final conference of SW voted to dissolve itself at its conference in January 2012.
* Workers Party of New Zealand (2002–2013) - The party was founded in 2002. It was originally formed by an electoral alliance of the original Workers&#x27; Party (pro-Mao, Marxist-Leninist) and the pro-Trotsky Revolution group. it is the first, and so far only, registered hard left political party under mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation.
* Black Cat BlackCat Anarchist Collective - an anarcho-communist group based in the city of Auckland.
* Communist Party of Aotearoa - a Maoist group that split from the Communist Party of New Zealand in 1993, condemning that organisation&#x27;s abandonment of Maoism and adoption of Trotskyism.
* Revolutionary Communist League of New Zealand founded in 1984 by students and lecturers at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. It was a revolutionary Marxist group affiliated with the United Secretariat of the Fourth International. After a few conferences, intending to rally opposition to Rogernomics, RCLNZ organized a larger nationwide grouping called Socialist Alliance which stood a candidate in the 1987 general election. The RCLNZ was transformed into the Socialist Workers&#x27; Project in 1990, based in the ChCh Centre for Socialist Education.
*New Zealand Marxian Association - a group established in 1918. It was founded to give endorsement and support to &quot;Marxian Revolutionist&quot; candidates in general elections.
* Organisation for Marxist Unity - a Maoist group.
* Revolutionary Workers League - a merger of the pro-Mao, Marxist-Leninist Workers&#x27; Party of New Zealand and the Revolution group. A tendency within the modern Workers&#x27; Party of New Zealand.
*Socialist Workers Organization - a revolutionary Trotskyist party. It was established by the Communist Party of New Zealand and the International Socialist Organization, although the majority of the latter group eventually withdrew from the merger. It was linked to the International Socialist Tendency. It evolved into the present-day Socialist Worker (Aotearoa) group.
*Workers&#x27; Party of New Zealand (pro-Mao, Marxist-Leninist) - A pro-Mao, Marxist-Leninist party founded by Ray Nunes, formerly a prominent member of the Communist Party of New Zealand. The party joined the Anti-Capitalist Alliance (ACA), a radical-left electoral alliance, in 2002. The Workers&#x27; Party merged with Revolution to become the Revolutionary Workers&#x27; League in 2004.
* Workers&#x27; Power - a Trotskyist group formed in 1981 with links to the global Workers&#x27; Power entity. It later absorbed a group called the &quot;Communist Left&quot;. It is linked to the League for a Fifth International.

===Contemporary left-wing media===
With the advent of the Internet during the 1990s and early 21st century, left-wing print media gave way to online alternative media, which were cheaper to produce. Notable left-wing New Zealand blogs have included the independent Marxist collective &quot;Redline&quot;, &quot;Against the Current&quot;, Martyn &quot;Bomber&quot; Bradbury&#x27;s current affairs–oriented &quot;The Daily Blog&quot; (2012–present), and &quot;The Standard&quot;. Besides blogs, left wing alternative media have also utilised email newsletters, publishing software, and major social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

<doc id="375446" wikidata="Q124753" url="?curid=375446" title="2007 Rugby World Cup">
<text>The 2007 Rugby World Cup () was the sixth Rugby World Cup, a quadrennial international rugby union competition organised by the International Rugby Board. Twenty nations competed for the Webb Ellis Cup in the tournament, which was hosted by France from 7 September to 20 October. France won the hosting rights in 2003, beating a bid from England. The competition consisted of 48 matches over 44 days; 42 matches were played in 10 cities throughout France, as well as four in Cardiff, Wales, and two in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The eight quarter-finalists from 2003 were granted automatic qualification, while 12 other nations gained entry through the regional qualifying competitions that began in 2004 – of them, Portugal was the only World Cup debutant. The top three nations from each pool at the end of the pool stage qualified automatically for the 2011 World Cup.

The competition opened with a match between hosts France and Argentina on 7 September at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, outside Paris. The stadium was also the venue of the final, played between England and South Africa on 20 October, which South Africa won 15–6 to win their second World Cup title.

==Bids==
Both England and France bid to host the tournament. The tender document for the 2007 bidding process was due out on 31 October 2001. Both England and France were invited to re-submit their plans. The International Rugby Board (IRB) stated that both countries must comply with tender document terms in one bid, but in their second option, could propose alternative ideas. The IRB said &quot;England&#x27;s original proposal contained three plans for hosting the tournament with a traditional, new and hybrid format all on offer... The French bid, while complying with the tender document in all other respects, fell outside one of the &#x27;windows&#x27; in which the IRB wanted to stage an event&quot;. England&#x27;s bids included a two-tier tournament and altering the structure of the qualifying tournament and France had a bid in September/October.

It was announced in April 2003 that France had won the right to host the tournament. The tournament was moved to the proposed September–October dates with the tournament structure remaining as it was. It was also announced that ten French cities would be hosting games, with the final at the Stade de France. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said that &quot;this decision illustrates the qualities of our country and its capacity to host major sporting events...This World Cup will be the opportunity to showcase the regions of France where the wonderful sport of rugby is deeply rooted&quot;. French Sports Minister Jean-François Lamour said that &quot;The organisation of this World Cup will shine over all of France because ten French towns have the privilege of organising matches and to be in the world&#x27;s spotlight.&quot; French cities to host games were Bordeaux, Lens, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier, Nantes, St. Etienne, Toulouse and Paris, and it was also announced that the final would be at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis.

==Qualifying==
The eight quarter-finalists from the 2003 World Cup all received automatic entry, with the other 12 nations coming from qualifying series around the world. Ten of the 20 positions available in the tournament were filled by regional qualifiers, with an additional two being filled by repechage qualification. The qualifying tournament was divided into five regional groups; Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. Qualifying matches began in 2004 and were completed in early 2007. Including the automatic qualifiers, over 90 nations were in qualifying contention for the final tournament.

In July 2005, both Samoa and Fiji were confirmed as the qualifiers from Oceania, as Oceania 1 and 2 respectively. In July of the following year, Argentina qualified as Americas 1 by defeating Uruguay 26–0 in Buenos Aires. Americas 2 was filled in August when Canada defeated the United States 56–7 in Newfoundland. The United States went on to qualify as Americas 3 after beating Uruguay in a two-legged tie in early October. That month also saw Italy qualify as Europe 1 after defeating Russia 67–7 in Moscow, reaching the first place in its qualifying group; Romania defeated Spain 43–20 in Madrid, and also qualified for the World Cup as Europe 2.

Namibia qualified for their third consecutive World Cup after they earned their spot in France by defeating Morocco over two legs in November. In late 2006, it was announced that the IRB had withdrawn Colombo as the venue of the final Asian qualifying tournament due to security problems. Japan won the only Asian allocation after the tournament was moved to Hong Kong. Georgia was 14 points the better of Portugal over two legs to claim the last European place. Tonga qualified through repechage after defeating Korea. The final spot went to Portugal, joining Pool C after beating Uruguay 24–23 on aggregate. Portugal&#x27;s qualification was the only change in the 20-team roster from the 2003 World Cup, replacing Uruguay, becoming the only wholly amateur team to qualify.

==Venues==
France won the right to host the 2007 World Cup in 2003, Then it was announced that 6 games would be held abroad, at the request of their neighbouring countries. Four matches would be held in Wales, at Cardiff&#x27;s 74,500-seat Millennium Stadium: two Pool B games involving Wales, the match between Fiji and Canada and a quarter-final. Ireland was to have hosted matches at Lansdowne Road, Dublin, but opted out because the stadium was being redeveloped.

Two of Scotland&#x27;s Pool C matches were played at Murrayfield Stadium in Scotland. The Scottish Rugby Union was reportedly having doubts in early 2006 about hosting these games and whether Scotland would generate enough market demand, but confirmed in April 2006 that the games would be played at Murrayfield. In the end, the Scotland v. New Zealand match failed to sell out, and the stadium was less than half-full for the Scotland v. Romania match.

There was a substantial increase in the overall capacity of stadiums compared to the 2003 Rugby World Cup – the smallest venue at the 2007 tournament could seat 33,900 people. The French venues were the same as those used for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Around 6,000 volunteers helped to organise the competition.

Although the 2007 tournament was the first to be hosted primarily by France, a number of matches during the 1991 and 1999 tournaments were played in France. In 1991, matches in Pool D (which included France) were played in Béziers, Bayonne, Grenoble, Toulouse, Brive and Agen, while Parc des Princes and Stadium Lille-Metropole each hosted a quarter-final. Similarly, in 1999, fixtures in Pool C (which included France) were played in Béziers, Bordeaux and Toulouse, Stade Félix-Bollaert was the venue for one of the quarter-final play-offs, and the Stade de France hosted a quarter-final.

==Tickets and sponsorship==

Ticket sales for the Rugby World Cup were broken up into three phases. The first phase was released in November 2005, when members of the European rugby community, such as officials, players and so on were given the opportunity for various packages. Upon the release of the second phase ticketing scheme, more than 100,000 tickets were sold in the first ten hours of release. The remaining tickets – individual tickets and tickets to the semi-finals – were released in phase three in November 2006. In June 2007, it was announced that 2 million of the 2.4 million tickets had been sold in advance of the tournament.

The Worldwide partners for the tournament were Société Générale, GMF, Électricité de France, Peugeot, Visa and SNCF, and official sponsors include Heineken, Vediorbis, Capgemini, Orange, Toshiba and Emirates. Gilbert provided the tournament balls, with the Gilbert Synergie match ball used throughout the tournament. This continued Gilbert&#x27;s involvement with the World Cup, the company having provided the Barbarian (1995), Revolution (1999) and Xact (2003) balls in the past. Along with Gilbert, the official suppliers were Adidas, Coca-Cola, Clifford Chance, Goodyear and McDonald&#x27;s. The host broadcaster for the event was TF1.

==Squads==

Each country was allowed a squad of 30 players for the tournament. These squads were to be submitted to the International Rugby Board by a deadline of 14 August 2007. Once the squad was submitted a player could be replaced if injured, but would not be allowed to return to the squad.

==Match officials==
The 2007 Rugby World Cup officials were appointed in late-April 2007, with 12 referees and 13 touch judges being chosen to officiate during the pool stage. In the knockout stage the 12 referees also acted as touch judges, with referee appointments being based on performance from previous matches and selection for neutrality. Referees came from seven different nationalities and three of them made their Rugby World Cup debut. The touch judges came from 10 countries. Tony Spreadbury of England officiated the opening game between France and Argentina at the Stade de France and Irishman Alain Rolland refereed the final.


==Pool format==
The competition was contested over 44 days between 20 different nations, over 48 fixtures. The tournament began on 7 September at the Stade de France with a match between the host nation, France, and Argentina. The tournament culminated at the same venue on 20 October for the final between England and South Africa.

===Pool stage===
Classification within each pool was based on the following scoring system:
*four match points for a win;
*two for a draw;
*zero for a loss.
Bonus points, contributing to a team&#x27;s cumulative match-point score, were awarded in each of the following instances (one match point for each event):
*a team scores four or more tries (regardless of the match result);
*a team loses by seven points (a converted try) or fewer.

At the end of the pool stage, teams were ranked from first to fifth based on cumulative match points, with the top two nations proceeding to the quarter-finals.

;Tie-breaking criteria
If at the completion of the pool phase two or more Teams were level on Match points, then the following criteria would have been used in the following order until one of the Teams could be determined as the higher ranked:

:i. The winner of the Match in which the two tied Teams have played each other shall be the higher ranked;
:ii. The Team which has the best difference between points scored for and points scored against in all its pool Matches shall be the higher ranked;
:iii. The Team which has the best difference between tries scored for and tries scored against in all its pool Matches shall be the higher ranked;
:iv. The Team which has scored most points in all its pool Matches shall be the higher ranked;
:v. The Team which has scored most tries in all its pool Matches shall be the higher ranked;
:vi. Should the tie be unresolved at the conclusion of steps (i) through (v), the Team that is higher ranked in the updated Official IRB World Rankings on 1 October 2007.

By elevating head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), a notable difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams with the same number of match points (table points). These rules allowed the winners of Pools A, B and C to be determined by the results of the third pool matches on the weekend of 22 and 23 September. Although other teams could theoretically draw level on table points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences at the end of the pool stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare. This also illustrates the fact that the pool tables do not tell the whole story.

===Knockout stage===
From this stage onwards, the tournament adopted a knockout format comprising eight fixtures: four quarter-finals, two semi-finals, a bronze medal match, and the final. The winner and runner-up from each of the four pools advanced to the quarter-finals. Pool winners were drawn against opposite pool runners-up in the quarter-finals, e.g. the winner of Pool A faced the runner up of Pool B, and the winner of Pool B faced the runner-up of Pool A.

In the knockout stage, if a match resulted in a draw after 80 minutes of normal play, further periods would be played to determine an outright winner. Initially, there would be two periods of extra time, 10 minutes each way; if there was no winner after this, then play would proceed to a single 10-minute period of &quot;sudden death&quot;. If the contest was unresolved after a total 110 minutes of open play, the winner would be determined by a placekicking competition.

===Effect on 2011 qualification===
In a change from the format of the previous tournament, the top three teams in each pool would qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand; previously, only the eight quarter-finalists gained an automatic place in the following tournament.

==Pool stage==

<text>Thomas Tickell (17 December 1685 – 23 April 1740) was a minor English poet and man of letters.

==Life==
The son of a clergyman, he was born at Bridekirk near Cockermouth, Cumberland. He was educated at St Bees School 1695–1701, and in 1701 entered The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, taking his M.A. degree in 1709. He became a fellow of his college in the next year, and in 1711 University Reader or Professor of Poetry. He did not take orders, but by a dispensation from the Crown was allowed to retain his fellowship until his marriage to Clotilda Eustace in 1726 in Dublin. Tickell acquired the name ‘Whigissimus’, because of his close association with the Whig parliamentary party.

In 1717 he was appointed Under Secretary to Joseph Addison, Secretary of State. In 1724 Tickell was appointed secretary to the Lords Justices of Ireland, a post which he retained until his death in 1740, at Bath, aged 54.

Tickell owned a house and small estate in Glasnevin on the banks of the River Tolka, which later became the site of the Botanic Gardens. A double line of yew trees (known as Addison&#x27;s Walk) from Tickell&#x27;s garden is incorporated into the Gardens.

He married in 1726 Clotilda Eustace, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Maurice Eustace of Harristown, County Kildare, and his second wife Clotilda Parsons. Maurice was in turn the nephew and heir of the immensely wealthy judge and landowner Sir Maurice Eustace, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Clotilde, who outlived her husband by more than fifty years, was described by her family as &quot;a most clever and excellent lady&quot;. They had four surviving children, including John, father of Richard. We have it on the authority of Samuel Johnson that Tickell was a devoted family man and temperate in his habits.

His grandson Richard Tickell became a playwright and married Mary Linley, of the Linley musical dynasty.

==Writing==
Tickell&#x27;s success in literature, as in life, was largely due to the friendship of Joseph Addison, who procured for him (1717) an under-secretaryship of state, to the chagrin of Richard Steele, who from then on bore a grudge against Tickell. During the peace negotiations with France, Tickell published in 1713 the &quot;Prospect of Peace&quot;.

In 1715 he brought out a translation of the first book of the &quot;Iliad&quot; contemporaneously with Alexander Pope&#x27;s version. Addison&#x27;s reported description of Tickell&#x27;s version as the best that ever was in any language roused the anger of Pope, who assumed that Addison was the author. Addison instructed Tickell to collect his works, which were printed in 1721 under Tickell&#x27;s editorship.

&quot;Kensington Garden&quot; (1722), Tickell&#x27;s longest poem, is sometimes viewed as inflated and pedantic. It has been said that Tickell&#x27;s poetic powers were awakened by his admiration for the person and genius of Addison, and undoubtedly his best work is the sincere and dignified elegy addressed to Addison&#x27;s stepson Edward Rich, 7th Earl of Warwick on Addison&#x27;s death: 
His ballad of &quot;Cohn and Mary&quot; was for a long time the most popular of his poems. Tickell contributed to &quot;The Spectator&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. *His &quot;Works&quot; were printed in 1749 and are included in Chalmers&#x27;s and other editions of the &quot;English Poets&quot;.

<text>Bromley, commonly known as 
Bromley-by-[[Bow, London|Bow]], is a district in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in East London, located on the western banks of the River Lea, in the Lower Lea Valley in East London. It is an inner-city suburb located 4.7 miles (7.5 km) east of Charing Cross.

The area is distinct from Bow, which lies immediately north of the formal boundary between the two, which runs along Bow Road, or near the Lea, slightly to the south of the Road. The area has historically been known as both Bromley and Bromley-by-Bow.
 In 1967, the latter name was chosen as the new name for Bromley tube station, a change designed to prevent confusion with Bromley railway station in the London Borough of Bromley.

The formal boundaries of the area were set when the area became a parish in 1537 when it split from Stepney. The boundaries of the new parish were based on those of much older pre-existing estates.

Bromley has a rich history, but many of its most historic buildings have been lost. It is connected to the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway.

==Toponymy==
In early records the name first appears as &quot;Brambele&quot;, &quot;Brambelegh&quot;, or &quot;Brembeley&quot; and is likely to be derived from the Saxon words &quot;Brembel&quot; – a bramble, and lege – a field. The name Bromley-by-Bow has historic pedigree, appearing in the correspondence of Oliver Cromwell. In 1967, the name was chosen as the new name for Bromley tube station to prevent confusion with Bromley railway station in the London Borough of Bromley.

Bow itself (also part of Stepney until the 18th century) was originally known as &quot;Stratforde&quot;, becoming &quot;Stratford-at-Bow&quot; when a medieval bridge was built, in the arched shape of a bow, to distinguish it from Stratford Langthorne on the other side of the River Lea.

==History==
===Pre-conquest to the creation of the Parish===
The oldest surviving written reference to the area, as &quot;Braembeleg&quot;, was from about the year 1000 when it was referred to as one of the manors belonging to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Bromley was home to St Leonard&#x27;s Priory a Benedictine nunnery founded in the time of William the Conqueror and mentioned in the General Prologue to Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. It was destroyed at the time of the Dissolution in 1536, and the manor and lands passed to Sir Ralph Sadleir, who lived at Sutton House in Homerton and was privy councillor to Henry VIII. The exception was the priory chapel which was retained.
The small Tudor period Bromley Hall was built in the late 15th century as the manor house of Lower Bromley. The house was radically remodeled soon after 1700 and over the following centuries served as a calico printing works, gentleman&#x27;s seat, gunpowder factory, charity home and a carpet warehouse. It is thought to be the oldest brick house in London.

===From the creation of the parish (1537) to 1850===
The priory chapel was turned into the parish church for a new parish, Bromley St Leonard, which split from the parish of Stepney and covered the area of two much older units, the Manor of Bromley and the estate of the Nunnery of St Leonard.

The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets).

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Bromley became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.

In 1606 a palace was built for James I facing the line of St Leonard&#x27;s Street by John Thorpe. This was principally used as a hunting lodge but was a grand residence of 24 rooms, including a Stateroom, built along the lines of Hardwick Hall and Montacute House. Some of the stonework was quarried from the remains of the (now disused) priory. It remained in Royal use and was refurbished in the reigns of Charles II and James II and stables were added. During the 18th century, the frontage of the building was renewed and the palace was converted into two merchant houses. It went through a variety of uses, including a boarding school and a colour works.

The house was demolished at the end of the 19th century by the London School Board for construction of a new board school. Many of the original fittings remained in place and were said to be in fine condition. The house was sold piecemeal for £250 with the Stateroom, panelling and an oak doorway going to the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Bromley was also known as Bromley-St Leonards, after St Leonard&#x27;s Priory a Benedictine nunnery founded in the time of William the Conqueror and mentioned in the General Prologue to Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. It was destroyed at the time of the Dissolution in 1536, and the manor and lands passed to Sir Ralph Sadleir, who lived at Sutton House in Homerton and was privy councillor to Henry VIII. The priory chapel was retained and turned into the parish church for a new parish, Bromley St Leonard, split from the parish of Stepney.


===1850–present===

In 1868, the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum was opened on a site next to the present day Bromley-by-Bow tube station. It was renamed St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital in 1921. It closed in 2006. A new housing development, William Guy Gardens, now occupies the site. Henry Grattan Guinness founded the East London Missionary Training Institute (also called Harley College) at Harley House in Bromley-by-Bow in 1873, with Dr. Thomas Barnardo as co-director. The school outgrew the premises and relocated in 1883, eventually becoming Cliff College.

The Revd Richard Enraght, religious controversialist, was the Curate of St Michael and All Angels Church in St Leonards Road from 1884 to 1888 and Rector of St Gabriel Church (now demolished), Chrisp Street (Poplar), from 1888 to 1895. Between 1899 and 1965 the parish of Bromley St Leonard formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, within the County of London.

On the other side of the River Lea, seven Victorian gasholders are is Grade II listed and have been named by the Victorian Society as a heritage building at risk of disrepair.

===Gandhi===
In 1931, Gandhi was in London for talks with the British Imperial government on the future of India-then a part of the British Empire, the only time he left India between 1914 and his death in 1948. He declined the government&#x27;s offer of accommodation in a West End hotel, preferring to stay in the East End, to live among working-class people, as he did in India. 
He based himself at Kingsley Hall in Powis Road, Bromley-by-Bow, for the three-month duration of his stay and was enthusiastically received by East Enders.

===WWII and Post-war===
The area suffered heavily in the Blitz and St Leonards Church was destroyed by enemy action in 1941. The area around Aberfeldy Street was heavily bombed and subsequently redeveloped into the Aberfeldy Estate in 1947.

The ruins and much of the churchyard were swept away when the Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road was built through the area in the 1960s.

==Governance==
The area loosely approximates to three wards in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The councillors elected in May 2018 were:
* Bromley North - Zenith Rahman (Labour) and Dan Tomlinson (Labour)
* Bromley South - Danny Hassell (Labour) and Helal Uddin (Labour).
* Lansbury - Rajib Ahmed, Kahar Chowdhury and Bex White (Labour)

==Geography==
===Extent===

Bromley-by-Bow is a part of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and takes in parts of the E3 (in the north) and E14 (in the south) postal districts.

To the north is Bow, with the historic boundary running along Bow Road, or near the River Lea, slightly to the south of the Road – with Bow&#x27;s parish church just south of the road, close to the Lea, a part of Bow. Stratford, West Ham and Canning Town are eastward, across the Lea, which is the boundary between the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham. The historic Three Mills and the Bromley-by-Bow gasholders lies just over the border in Newham.

Mile End is located to the west of a historic boundary which runs through Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park and along parts of Bow Common Lane, though the small former open space which was known as Bow Common, on either side of part of that road, lay just on the other side of that boundary, wholly within Mile End. 
Poplar lies to the south, though the line of the historic boundary from Upper North Street heading south-east to the Lea, by the Leamouth Roundabout, has been blurred by patterns of urbanisation which did not follow the historic estate, parish and (for a time) ward boundaries that defined these areas.

The area is bisected north to south by the Blackwall Tunnel Approach Road (A12). The land between that road and the Lea is undergoing extensive redevelopment.

===Demographics===
In 2001, according to the UK national census data, there were 11,581 people living in the ward in 2188 households, giving an average of 2.8 people per household. Of these 51% were female, 30% were under the age of 16 and 40% were of Bangladeshi origin.

Tenure in Bromley-by-Bow ward was predominantly rented with only 15% of households being owner-occupiers. Census data indicates that the proportion of households in rented tenure was higher than the average for the borough. 60% of males were economically active with total unemployment being around 16% compared to 11% for the borough as a whole.

South Bromley railway station on the North London Railway between Bow and Poplar (East India Dock Road) stations opened in 1884, the station lay just to the north of the current Langdon Park DLR station which opened in 2009.

London Buses routes 108, 309, 323, 488 and D8 operate within the area. Route 108 uses the Blackwall Tunnel, a source of severe delays which leads to the route often being cited as amongst the least reliable in London.

<doc id="375451" wikidata="Q1373915" url="?curid=375451" title="Empress Xiaozhuangwen">
<text>Bumbutai (; ; ; 28 March 1613 – 27 January 1688), of the Khorchin Mongol Borjigit clan, was the consort of Hong Taiji. She was 21 years his junior. She was honoured as Empress Dowager Zhaosheng during the reign of her son, Fulin, the Shunzhi Emperor, and as Grand Empress Dowager Zhaosheng during the reign of her grandson, Xuanye, the Kangxi Emperor. 

As empress dowager and grand empress dowager, she had significant influence in the Qing imperial court and was highly respected for her political wisdom and insight. After her death, she was posthumously honoured with the title Empress Xiaozhuangwen, although she never held the rank of empress consort during her lifetime.

==Life==
===Family background===
* Father: Zhaisang (), held the title of a first rank prince ()
** Paternal grandfather: Manggusi (), held the title of a first rank prince ()
** Paternal aunt: Empress Xiaoduanwen (1599–1649)
* Mother: Boli (; d. 1654)
* Four elder brothers
* One elder sister
** Primary consort Minhui (1609–1641)

===Wanli era===
Bumbutai was born on the eighth day of the intercalary second lunar month in the 41st year of the reign of the Wanli Emperor, which translates to 28 March 1613 in the Gregorian calendar.

===Tianming era===
In March or April 1625, Bumbutai married Hong Taiji and became one of his multiple wives. Prior to this, the Khorchin Mongols had sent Hong Taiji another woman, Jerjer, the future Empress Xiaoduanwen, on 28 May 1614, to strengthen the relationship between the Qing dynasty and the Khorchin. Bumbutai&#x27;s elder sister, Harjol, the future primary consort Minhui, would marry Hong Taiji on 6 December 1634.

===Chongde era===
Bumbutai gave birth on 31 January 1629 to Hong Taiji&#x27;s fourth daughter, Princess Yongmu of the First Rank, on 2 March 1632 to his fifth daughter, Princess Shuhui of the First Rank, and on 16 December 1633 to his seventh daughter, Princess Shuzhe of the First Rank.

When Hong Taiji conferred titles on his five primary spouses in August 1636, Bumbutai was named &quot;Consort Zhuang&quot; of Yongfu Palace (永福宮).

On 15 March 1638, Consort Zhuang gave birth to Hong Taiji&#x27;s ninth son, Fulin.

===Shunzhi era===
Hong Taiji died on 21 September 1643 and was succeeded by Fulin, who was enthroned as the Shunzhi Emperor. Bumbutai, as the mother of the reigning emperor, was honoured with the title &quot;Holy Mother, Empress Dowager&quot; with honorary name &quot;Zhaosheng&quot;. Her aunt Jerjer, as the empress consort of the previous emperor, was similarly honored as &quot;Mother Empress, Empress Dowager&quot;. Hong Taiji&#x27;s younger half-brother, Dorgon, was appointed as prince regent to rule on behalf of the Shunzhi Emperor until the emperor reached adulthood. After Dorgon died on 31 December 1650, the Shunzhi Emperor posthumously stripped him of his princely title and had his dead body exhumed and mutilated. It is believed – though not supported by historical evidence – that Empress Dowager Zhaosheng secretly married Dorgon after Hong Taiji&#x27;s death, since levirate marriage was common among Mongols.

===Kangxi era===
Empress Dowager Zhaosheng kept a low profile during the reign of her son and had little interference in politics. The Shunzhi Emperor died on 5 February 1661 and was succeeded by his third son Xuanye, who was enthroned as the Kangxi Emperor. As the grandmother of the reigning emperor, she was honored as &quot;Grand Empress Dowager Zhaosheng&quot;. Since the emperor was underage at the time, the Four Regents of the Kangxi Emperor, appointed by the Shunzhi Emperor, ruled on his behalf until he reached adulthood. During this time, Grand Empress Dowager Zhaosheng advised her grandson to learn from the regents and took charge of his upbringing after the emperor&#x27;s mother died.

When the Kangxi Emperor grew up and began his personal rule in 1667, he felt threatened by the strong influence of Oboi, one of the four regents. Two years later, Grand Empress Dowager Zhaosheng assisted her grandson in his plans to get rid of Oboi. Oboi was lured into a trap (forced to sit on a broken chair), placed under arrest, and removed from power. Throughout her life, Bumbutai disliked living in the Forbidden City, despite the luxurious conditions it offered. She also refused to hold any birthday celebrations as she felt that it would be costly.

When Grand Empress Dowager Zhaosheng fell sick in the autumn of 1687, the Kangxi Emperor personally took care of his grandmother. She died on 27 January 1688.

<doc id="375454" wikidata="Q835109" url="?curid=375454" title="Social Democratic Party (Japan)">
<text>The is a political party in Japan that was established in 1996. Since its reformation and name change in 1996, it has advocated pacifism and defined itself as a social-democratic party. It was previously known as the .

The party was re-founded in January 1996 by the majority of legislators of the former Japan Socialist Party, which was the largest opposition party in the 1955 System. However, most of those legislators joined the Democratic Party of Japan after that. Five leftist legislators who did not join the SDP formed the New Socialist Party, which lost all its seats in the following election. The SDP enjoyed a short period of government participation from 1993 to 1994 as part of the Hosokawa Cabinet and later formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democratic Party under 81st Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of the JSP from 1994 to January 1996. The SDP was part of ruling coalitions between January and November 1996 (First Hashimoto Cabinet) and from 2009 to 2010 (Hatoyama Cabinet).

In the 2019 Japanese House of Councillors election, the party won four representatives in the National Diet, two in the lower house and two in the upper house. In November 2020, the party entered into a merger agreement with the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) with the SDP&#x27;s members in the Diet caucusing with the CDP. The party president Mizuho Fukushima held her seat and, in the 2022 House of Councillors elections, the party cleared the minimum two percent voter share to maintain its legal political party status.

== History ==
=== Before 2000 ===

In 1995, the former Japan Socialist Party (JSP) was in a deep crisis, facing criticism for entering a coalition with its long-time rival, the LDP and for core policy changes. Aiming at saving the party, the leadership of JSP decided to dissolve the party and to establish a new social democratic party. In January 1996, a new party, the Social Democratic Party, was established, along with the dissolution of JSP. &quot;De jure&quot;, JSP changed its name to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) as an interim party for forming a new party, and a movement for transforming the SDP into a new social-democratic and liberal party was unsuccessful.

Under Murayama&#x27;s successor Ryūtarō Hashimoto (LDP), the SDP remained part of the ruling coalition. Long before its disappointing result in the 1996 Japanese general election, the party lost the majority of its members of the House of Representatives, mainly to predecessors of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) that was formed in 1996, but also some to the NFP and other opposition parties. After its electoral defeat in the 1996 general election, when it lost another 15 of its remaining 30 seats in the lower house, the SDP left the ruling coalition, which it had entered as the second-largest force in Japanese politics, as a minor party.

=== 2000s–2010s ===
The SDP won six seats in the 2003 Japanese general election, compared with 18 seats in the previous 2000 Japanese general election. The party&#x27;s opposition to the Self-Defense Forces reverted to the abolition of the forces in the long term, the policy it had in the 1950s. Doi had been the leader since 1996, but she resigned in 2003, taking responsibility for the election losses. Mizuho Fukushima was elected as the new party leader in November 2003. In the 2004 Japanese House of Councillors election, the SDP won only two seats, having five seats in the House of Councillors and six seats in the House of Representatives. In 2006, the party unexpectedly gained the governorship of the Shiga Prefecture. In the 2009 Japanese general election, the DPJ made large gains and the SDP maintained its base of 7 seats in the, becoming a junior partner in a new government coalition; however, disagreements over the issue of the Futenma base led to the sacking of Fukushima from the cabinet on 28 May and the SDP subsequently voted to leave the ruling coalition.

As of October 2010, the SDP had six members in the House of Representatives and four members in the House of Councillors. Following the 2012 Japanese general election, the party retained only six seats in the whole of the Diet, two in the House of Representatives and four in the House of Councillors. The count lowered to five seats in 2013. In 2013, the party&#x27;s headquarters in Nagatacho, where the party&#x27;s predecessor the JSP had moved in 1964, were demolished. The headquarters moved to a smaller office in Nagatacho.

During the nomination period of the 2016 Japanese House of Councillors election, the party signed an agreement with the Democratic, Communist and People&#x27;s Life parties to field a jointly-endorsed candidate in each of the 32 districts in which only one seat is contested, thereby uniting in an attempt to take control of the House from the LDP/Komeito coalition. The party had two Councillors up for re-election and fielded a total of 11 candidates in the election, 4 in single and multi-member districts and 7 in the 48-seat national proportional representation block.

In the 2017 Japanese general election, the party managed to hold to its two seats it had prior to the election. Tadatomo Yoshida declined to run for re-election when his term expired in January 2018. Seiji Mataichi was elected unopposed in the ensuing leadership election and took office on 25 February 2018.

=== Since 2020 ===
On 14 November 2020, the party voted to agree to a merger arrangement with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), allowing members to leave the SDP and join the latter party. The majority of the party supported the agreement and joined the CDP; however, party leader Fukushima herself was opposed to the merger agreement and remains a member of the Social Democratic Party.

In the 2021 Japanese general election, the party lost one of their two seats.

<text>Yunreng (6 June 1674 – 27 January 1725), born Yinreng, was a Manchu prince of the Qing dynasty. He was the second among the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s sons to survive into adulthood and was designated as Crown Prince for two terms between 1675 and 1712 before being deposed. He was posthumously honoured as Prince Limi of the First Rank.

==Biography==
Yunreng was born of the Manchu Aisin Gioro clan as the seventh son of the Kangxi Emperor, but was the second among the emperor&#x27;s sons to survive into adulthood. He was given the infant name &quot;Baocheng&quot; (保成), and was renamed &quot;Yinreng&quot; when he became older. His mother was the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s first empress, Empress Xiaochengren from the Hešeri clan, who was also a granddaughter of Sonin (one of the four regents in the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s early reign). She died not long after giving birth to Yinreng, and was greatly lamented by the Kangxi Emperor.

The Kangxi Emperor personally taught Yinreng to read and he proclaimed Yinreng as his Crown Prince when Yinreng was only a year old. Under the tutelage of several scholar-officials, Yinreng became well-versed in the Chinese and Manchu languages. Between 1696 and 1697, when the Kangxi Emperor was away twice on military campaigns against Galdan Khan of the Zunghar Khanate, Yinreng was appointed as regent to supervise affairs in the imperial capital, Beijing. Despite scandals and accusations of immorality, Yinreng remained in his father&#x27;s favour and was given the Western Gardens (西花園) of Beijing as his residence.

In 1703, Yinreng&#x27;s granduncle Songgotu was found guilty of attempting to murder the Kangxi Emperor, along with a series of corruption charges, and was imprisoned and died shortly afterwards. Yinreng gradually fell out of his father&#x27;s favour as a result. In 1708, during a hunting expedition in Rehe, the Kangxi Emperor accused Yinreng of immorality, sexual impropriety, usurping power, and treason. Yinreng was stripped of his position as Crown Prince and imprisoned. When it was later discovered that the First Prince Yinzhi had employed lamas to cast evil spells on Yinreng, the Kangxi Emperor pardoned Yinreng in 1709 and restored him as Crown Prince. In the following three years, Yinreng&#x27;s condition deteriorated and the Kangxi Emperor became convinced that Yinreng was insane. Consequently, in 1712, Yinreng was deposed again and placed in perpetual confinement.

In 1722, the Kangxi Emperor died and was succeeded by his fourth son Yinzhen, who became historically known as the Yongzheng Emperor. Yinreng changed his name to Yunreng to avoid naming taboo because the Chinese character for &quot;Yin&quot; (胤) in &quot;Yinreng&quot; is the same as the one in the Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s personal name &quot;Yinzhen&quot; (胤禛). Yunreng died three years later in 1725 while still being incarcerated. He was granted the posthumous title of &quot;Prince Limi of the First Rank&quot; (和碩理密親王).

The bitter factionalism between the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s sons and the dispute over the succession prompted the Yongzheng Emperor to establish a practice of writing a secret imperial edict on who would succeed to the throne, and sealing the edict in a box behind a tablet in the Palace of Heavenly Purity in the Forbidden City. The edict would only be publicly revealed upon the death of the reigning emperor.

<text>Daniel Maclise (25 January 180625 April 1870) was an Irish history painter, literary and portrait painter, and illustrator, who worked for most of his life in London, England.

==Early life==
Maclise was born in Cork, Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), the son of Alexander McLish (also known as McLeish, McLish, McClisse or McLise), a tanner or shoemaker, but formerly a Scottish Highlander soldier. His education was of the plainest kind, but he was eager for culture, fond of reading, and anxious to become an artist. His father, however, placed him in employment, in 1820, in Newenham&#x27;s Bank, where he remained for two years, before leaving to study at the Cork School of Art. In 1825 it happened that Sir Walter Scott was travelling in Ireland, and young Maclise, having seen him in a bookseller&#x27;s shop, made a surreptitious sketch of the great man, which he afterwards lithographed. It became very popular, and led to many commissions for portraits, which he executed, in pencil.

Various influential friends recognised Maclise&#x27;s genius and promise, and were anxious to furnish him with the means of studying in London; but refusing all financial assistance, he saved the money himself and arrived in the capital on 18 July 1827. There he made a sketch of Charles John Kean, the actor, which, like his portrait of Scott, was lithographed and published, making the artist a considerable sum. He entered the Royal Academy schools in 1828, eventually being awarded the highest prizes open to students.

==Career==
Maclise exhibited for the first time at the Royal Academy in 1829.
Gradually he began to confine himself more exclusively to subject and historical pictures, varied occasionally by portraits – such as those of Lord Campbell, novelist Letitia Landon, Dickens, and other of his literary friends.
In 1833, he exhibited two pictures which greatly increased his reputation, and in 1835 the &quot;Chivalric Vow of the Ladies&quot; and the &quot;Peacock&quot; procured his election as associate of the Academy, of which he became full member in 1840. 
The years that followed were occupied with a long series of figure pictures, deriving their subjects from history and tradition and from the works of Shakespeare, Goldsmith and Le Sage.

He also designed illustrations for several of Dickens&#x27;s Christmas books and other works. Between the years 1830 and 1836 he contributed to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, under the pseudonym of Alfred Croquis, a remarkable series of portraits of the literary and other celebrities of the time – character studies, etched or lithographed in outline, and touched more or less with the emphasis of the caricaturist, which were afterwards published as the &quot;Maclise Portrait Gallery&quot; (1871). During the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament in London in 1834–1850 by Charles Barry, Maclise was commissioned in 1846 to paint murals in the House of Lords on such subjects as &quot;Justice&quot; and &quot;Chivalry&quot;.

In 1858, Maclise commenced one of the two great monumental works of his life, &quot;The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher after the Battle of Waterloo&quot;, on the walls of Westminster Palace. It was begun in fresco, a process which proved unmanageable. The artist wished to resign the task, but, encouraged by Prince Albert, he studied in Berlin the new method of water-glass painting, and carried out the subject and its companion, &quot;The Death of Nelson&quot;, in that medium, completing the latter painting in 1864.

Maclise&#x27;s vast painting of &quot;The Marriage of Strongbow and Aoife&quot; (1854) hangs in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin. It portrays the marriage of the main Norman conqueror of Ireland &quot;Strongbow&quot; to the daughter of his Gaelic ally. The painting is said to relate Maclise&#x27;s nationalist feelings and his knowledge of ancient, Irish, civilization. 

By the grand staircase of Halifax Town Hall, which was completed in 1863, there is a wall painting by Maclise.

The intense application which he gave to these great historic works, and various circumstances connected with the commission, had a serious effect on the artist&#x27;s health. He began to shun the company in which he formerly delighted, his old buoyancy of spirits was gone, and when, in 1865, the presidency of the Royal Academy was offered to him he declined the honour. He died of acute pneumonia on 25 April 1870 at his home 4 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea.

His works are distinguished by powerful intellectual and imaginative qualities, but, in the opinion of Monkhouse, a late Victorian critic, somewhat marred by harsh and dull colouring, by metallic hardness of surface and texture, and by frequent touches of the theatrical in the action and attitudes of the figures. His fame rests most securely on his two greatest works at Westminster.

A memoir of Maclise, by his friend William Justin O&#x27;Driscoll, was published in 1871.

==Posthumous exhibitions==
===National Portrait Gallery, 1972===
The works of Maclise in portraiture were celebrated in 1972 at an exhibition in the National Portrait Gallery.

===Crawford Art Gallery, 2008===
The Crawford Art Gallery in Cork, Ireland, Maclise&#x27;s native city, held a major exhibition of his works, &quot;Daniel Maclise: Romancing the Past&quot; (28 October 2008 - 14 February 2009), opened by David Puttnam.

===Royal Academy, 2015===
The preliminary sketch for &quot;The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher&quot; was displayed at the Royal Academy of Arts from 2 September 2015 to 3 January 2016, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. It had been displayed previously from 23 May until 23 August at the Royal Armouries in Leeds as part of the &quot;Waterloo 1815: The Art of Battle&quot; exhibition.

<text>Letitia Elizabeth Landon (14 August 1802 – 15 October 1838) was an English poet and novelist, better known by her initials L.E.L.

Landon&#x27;s writings are emblematic of the transition from Romanticism to Victorian literature. Her first major breakthrough came with &quot;The Improvisatrice&quot; and thence she developed the metrical romance towards the Victorian ideal of the Victorian monologue, influencing fellow English writers such as Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Alfred Tennyson and Christina Rossetti. Her influence can also be found in the United States, where she was very popular. Edgar Allan Poe regarded her genius as self-evident.

In spite of these wide influences, due to the perceived immorality of Landon&#x27;s lifestyle, her works were largely ignored or misrepresented after her death.

== Early life ==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon was born on 14 August 1802 in Chelsea, London to John Landon and Catherine Jane, &quot;née&quot; Bishop. 
A precocious child, Landon learned to read as a toddler; a disabled neighbour would scatter letter tiles on the floor and reward young Letitia for reading, and, according to her father, &quot;she used to bring home many rewards&quot;.

At the age of five, Landon began attending Frances Arabella Rowden&#x27;s school at 22 Hans Place, Knightsbridge. Rowden was an engaging teacher, a poet, and had a particular enthusiasm for the theatre. According to Mary Russell Mitford, &quot;she had a knack of making poetesses of her pupils&quot;. Other pupils of Rowden include Caroline Ponsonby, later Lady Caroline Lamb; Emma Roberts, the travel writer; Anna Maria Fielding, who published as Mrs S. C. Hall; and Rosina Doyle Wheeler, who married Edward Bulwer-Lytton and published her many novels as Rosina Bulwer Lytton. At Rowden&#x27;s school, Landon became fluent in French from an early age.

The Landons moved to the countryside in 1809, so that John Landon could carry out a model farm project. Letitia Landon was educated at home by her older cousin Elizabeth from that point on. Elizabeth found her knowledge and abilities outstripped by those of her pupil: &quot;When I asked Letitia any question relating either to history, geography, grammar – Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;, or to any book we had been reading, I was pretty certain her answers would be perfectly correct; still, not exactly recollecting, and unwilling she should find out just then that I was less learned than herself, I used thus to question her: &#x27;Are you quite certain?&#x27; ... I never knew her to be wrong.&quot;

When young, Landon was close to her younger brother, Whittington Henry, born 1804. Paying for university education for him, at Worcester College, Oxford, was one of the reasons that brought Landon to publish. She also supported his preferment and later (in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1838) dedicated her poetical illustration &quot;Captain Cook&quot; to him, in recollection of their domestic childhood adventures together. Whittington went on to become a minister and published a book of sermons in 1835. Rather than showing appreciation for his sister&#x27;s assistance, he spread false rumours about her marriage and death. Landon also had a younger sister, Elizabeth Jane (born 1806), who was a frail child and died in 1819 at the age of 13. Little is known of Elizabeth, but her death likely left a lasting impression on Letitia, and it could be Elizabeth who is referred to in the poem &quot;The Forgotten One&quot; (&quot;I have no early flowers to fling&quot;).
== Literary career ==

=== Early Career: 1820-1834 ===
An agricultural depression caused the Landon family to move back to London in 1815. There, John Landon met William Jerdan, editor of &quot;The Literary Gazette&quot;. According to Mrs A. T. Thomson, Jerdan took notice of the young Letitia Landon when he saw her coming down the street, &quot;trundling a hoop with one hand, and holding in the other a book of poems, of which she was catching a glimpse between the agitating course of her evolutions&quot;. Jerdan later described her ideas as &quot;original and extraordinary&quot;. He encouraged Landon&#x27;s poetic endeavours, and her first poem was published under the single initial &quot;L&quot; in the &quot;Gazette&quot; in 1820, when Landon was 18. The following year, with financial support from her grandmother, Landon published a book of poetry, &quot;The Fate of Adelaide&quot;, under her full name. The book met with little critical notice, but sold well; Landon, however, received no profits, since the publisher shortly went out of business. The same month that &quot;The Fate of Adelaide&quot; appeared, Landon published two poems under the initials &quot;L.E.L.&quot; in the &quot;Gazette;&quot; these poems, and the initials under which they were published, attracted much discussion and speculation. As contemporary critic Laman Blanchard put it, the initials L.E.L. &quot;speedily became a signature of magical interest and curiosity&quot;. Bulwer Lytton wrote that, as a young college student, he and his classmates would

rush every Saturday afternoon for the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot;, [with] an impatient anxiety to hasten at once to that corner of the sheet which contained the three magical letters L.E.L. And all of us praised the verse, and all of us guessed at the author. We soon learned it was a female, and our admiration was doubled, and our conjectures tripled.

Landon served as the &quot;Gazette&quot;″s chief reviewer as she continued to write poetry and she soon began to display an interest in art, which she projected into her poetic productions. She began, in innovative fashion, with a series on &quot;Medallion Wafers&quot;, which were commercially produced highly decorative letter seals. This was closely followed in the Literary Gazette by a &quot;Poetical Catalogue of Pictures&quot;, which was to be &#x27;continued occasionally&#x27; and which in fact continued unremarked into 1824, the year her landmark volume, &quot;The Improvisatrice; and Other Poems&quot; was published. A further group of these poems was published in 1825 in her next volume, &quot;The Troubadour&quot;, as &quot;Poetical Sketches of Modern Pictures&quot;. In The Troubadour she included a lament for her late father, who died in 1824, thus forcing her to write to support her family; Some contemporaries saw this profit-motive as detrimental to the quality of Landon&#x27;s work: a woman was not supposed to be a professional writer. Also, by 1826, Landon&#x27;s reputation began to suffer as rumours circulated that she had had affairs or secretly borne children. However, her further volumes of poetry continued to be favourably reviewed, these being &quot;The Golden Violet with its Tales of Romance and Chivalry and Other Poems&quot; (1827) and &quot;The Venetian Bracelet, The Lost Pleiad, A History of the Lyre, and Other Poems&quot; (1829). During these years she became known as the &#x27;female Byron&#x27;.

The new trend of annual gift books provided her with new opportunities for continuing her engagement with art through combinations of an engraved artwork and what she came to call ‘a poetical illustration’. In the 1830s she became a highly valued artist in this field, included amongst her work, most of the poetry for Fisher’s Drawing Room Scrap Books from 1832 through to 1839. Sarah Sheppard describes this work thus: &#x27;How did pictures ever seem to speak to her soul! how would she seize on some interesting characteristic in the painting or engraving before her, and inspire it with new life, till that pictured scene spread before you in bright association with some touching history or spirit-stirring poem! L.E.L.&#x27;s appreciation of painting, like that of music, was intellectual rather than mechanical,—belonging to the combinations rather than to the details; she loved the poetical effects and suggestive influences of the Arts, although caring not for their mere technicalities.&#x27; In the words of Glenn T. Hines, &#x27;What L.E.L.&#x27;s readers appreciated in her creations was that &quot;new life&quot; that she brought to her subject. Her imaginative re-castings produced intellectual pleasure for her audience. The wonderful characteristic of L.E.L.&#x27;s writings, which her readers recognized, was the author&#x27;s special creative capacity to bring new meanings to her audience.&#x27; 

Landon continued to publish poetry, and published her first work of prose in 1831 with her first novel, &quot;Romance and Reality&quot;. The following year, she produced her only volume of religious poetry, &quot;The Easter Gift&quot;, again as illustrations to engravings of artwork. Next she was responsible for the whole of &quot;Heath&#x27;s Book of Beauty, 1833&quot;, her most self-consciously Byronic volume, which opens with &quot;The Enchantress&quot; in which she creates a &#x27;Promethean, distinctly Luciferan, model of poetic identity and self-creation&#x27;. She returned to the long poem with &quot;The Zenana&quot; in the Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834 and gave the 1835 Scrap Book a sting in the tale with &quot;The Fairy of the Fountains&quot;, Landon&#x27;s version of the Melusine legend displaying &#x27;the aesthetic dilemma of the woman poet who is exiled not once like the male poet, but twice&#x27;. 1834 also saw the publication of her second novel, &quot;Francesca Carrara&quot;, of which one reviewer commented &#x27;A sterner goddess never presided over the destinies of a novel&#x27;.

In July that year Landon visited Paris with a friend, Miss Turin, who was unfortunately taken ill, restricting Landon&#x27;s activities. However, amongst those she met were Heinrich Heine, Prosper Mérimée, Chateaubriand and Madame Tastu.

=== Engagement John Forster: 1835-1836 ===
In 1835, Landon became engaged to John Forster. Forster became aware of rumours regarding Landon&#x27;s sexual activity, and asked her to refute them. Landon responded that Forster should &quot;make every inquiry in [his] power&quot;, which Forster did; after he pronounced himself satisfied, however, Landon broke off their engagement. To him, she wrote:

The more I think, the more I feel I ought not – I can not – allow you to unite yourself with one accused of – I can not write it. The mere suspicion is dreadful as death. Were it stated as a fact, that might be disproved. Were it a difficulty of any other kind, I might say, Look back at every action of my life, ask every friend I have. But what answer can I give ...? I feel that to give up all idea of a near and dear connection is as much my duty to myself as to you...

Privately, Landon stated that she would never marry a man who had mistrusted her. In a letter to Bulwer Lytton, she wrote that &quot;if his future protection is to harass and humiliate me as much as his present – God keep me from it ... I cannot get over the entire want of delicacy to me which could repeat such slander to myself.&quot;

A further volume of poetry, &quot;The Vow of the Peacock&quot;, was published in 1835 and, in 1836, a volume of stories and poetry for children, &quot;Traits and Trials of Early Life&quot;. &quot;The History of a Child&quot; from this volume may draw on the surroundings of her childhood but the circumstances of the story are so unlike the known facts of her early life that it can scarcely be considered as autobiographical.

=== Later career ===

During the 1830s, Landon’s poetry became more thoughtful and mature. Some of her best poems appeared in &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; culminating in the series, &quot;Subjects for Pictures&quot;, with their elaborate rhyming patterns. These are in a sense a reversal of her earlier poetical illustrations of existing pictures. Also in that magazine is the set, &quot;Three Extracts from the Diary of a Week&quot; and here, she expresses her aim in opening lines, which, in Sypher’s words &#x27;could stand as a preface to much of her poetry&#x27;.
&lt;poem&gt;A record of the inward world, whose facts 
Are thoughts—and feelings—fears, and hopes, and dreams. 
There are some days that might outmeasure years— 
Days that obliterate the past, and make 
The future of the colour which they cast. 
A day may be a destiny; for life 
Lives in but little—but that little teems 
With some one chance, the balance of all time: 
A look—a word—and we are wholly changed. 
We marvel at ourselves—we would deny 
That which is working in the hidden soul; 
But the heart knows and trembles at the truth: 
On such these records linger.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1837, Landon published another novel, &quot;Ethel Churchill&quot;, and began to explore new forms in which to express her literary talent. One of these was her dramatic tragedy, &quot;Castruccio Castracani&quot;, which represents a culmination of her development of the metrical romance, both in its form and content. Already, she had experimented with verses for &quot;Schloss&#x27;s Bijou Almanacks&quot;, which measured 3/4 by 1/2 inch and were to be read with a magnifier. She also negotiated with Heath for the publication in the future of a series of &quot;Female Portraits&quot; of characters from literature. Her final endeavour was &quot;Lady Anne Granard (or Keeping up Appearances)&quot;, a lighter novel, but her work on this at Cape Coast was cut short.

==Later life==

Landon began to &quot;[talk] of marrying any one, and of wishing to get away, from England, and from those who had thus misunderstood her&quot;. In October 1836, Landon met George Maclean, governor of the Gold Coast (now Ghana), at a dinner party given by Matthew Forster, and the two began a relationship. Maclean moved to Scotland early the following year, to the surprise and distress of Landon and her friends. After much prodding, Maclean returned to England and he and Landon were married shortly thereafter, on 7 June 1838. The marriage was held privately, and Landon spent the first month of it living with friends. Her schoolfriend Emma Roberts wrote of Maclean:

No one could better appreciate than L.E.L. the high and sterling qualities of her lover&#x27;s character, his philanthropic and unceasing endeavours to improve the condition of the natives of Africa; the noble manner in which he interfered to prevent the horrid waste of human life by the barbarian princes in his neighbourhood; and the chivalric energy with which he strove to put an end to the slave-trade. L.E.L. esteemed Mr Maclean the more, in consequence of his not approaching her with the adulation with which her ear had been accustomed, to satiety; she was gratified by the manly nature of his attachment. Possessing, in her estimation, merits of the highest order, the influence which he gained over her promised, in the opinion of those who were best acquainted with the docility of her temper, and her ready acquiescence with the wishes of those she loved, to ensure lasting happiness.In early July, the couple sailed for Cape Coast, where they arrived on 16 August 1838. During the short time she had in Africa, Landon continued her work on &quot;The Female Portrait Gallery&quot;, covering Walter Scott&#x27;s principal heroines, and completed the first volume of a new novel, &quot;Lady Anne Granard, or Keeping Up Appearances&quot;.

In his 1883 memoir &quot;Retrospect of a Long Life&quot;, Samuel Carter Hall writes of Landon&#x27;s marriage and husband in very negative terms. &quot;Her marriage wrecked her life; but before that fatal mistake was made, slander had been busy with her fair fame&quot; (Retrospect, p. 395). Landon had taken &quot;refuge from [slander] . . . in union with a man utterly incapable of appreciating her or making her happy, and [she] went out with him to his government at the Gold Coast -- to die&quot; (ibid.). Her death was &quot;not even -- tragical as such an ending would have been . . . to wither before the pestilential influences that steam up from that wilderness of swamp and jungle&quot; but rather &quot;to die a violent death -- a fearful one&quot; (ibid.). Here Hall asserts his belief that Landon was murdered by her husband&#x27;s common-law wife: &quot;unhappy &#x27;L.E.L.&#x27; was murdered I have had a doubt. . . . She landed at Cape Coast Castle in July, 1838, and on the 15th of October she was dead . . . from having accidentally taken a dose of prussic acid. But where was she to have procured that poison? . . . .It was not among the contents of the medicine-chest she took out from England&quot; (ibid., pp. 395–396). Rather, claims Hall, after arriving in Africa, &quot;Maclean left her on board while he went to arrange matters on shore. A negro woman was there, with four or five children -- his children; she had to be sent into the interior to make room for her legitimate successor. It is understood the negress was the daughter of a king . . . [and] from the moment &#x27;L.E.L.&#x27; landed her life was at the mercy of her rival; that by her hand she was done to death I am all but certain&quot; (ibid., p. 396).

In fact, Maclean&#x27;s local mistress had left for Accra long before their arrival, as was confirmed by later interviews with her. His going ashore was most likely to ensure that the accommodation arranged for his new wife was in a healthy condition. The date on her prescription for dilute prussic acid was 1836, probably given when she was first diagnosed as having a critical heart condition. Letitia told her husband that her life depended on it.

Most of Hall&#x27;s accounts are based on the fantastic stories invented by the press following Mrs Maclean&#x27;s death and have little or no basis in fact.

==Death==
Two months later, on 15 October 1838, Landon was found dead, a bottle of dilute prussic acid in her hand. This was a prescription labelled &#x27;Acid Hydrocianicum Delatum, Pharm. London 1836. Medium Dose Five Minims, being about one third the strength of that in former use, prepared by Scheele&#x27;s proof&#x27;. There is evidence that she showed symptoms of Stokes–Adams syndrome (for one, Mrs Elwood writes that she was subject to spasms, hysterical affections, and deep and instantaneous fainting fits) for which the dilute acid was the standard remedy and, as she told her husband it was so necessary for the preservation of her life, it would appear she had been told that her life was in danger. William Cobbald, the surgeon who attended, reported that &#x27;she was insensible with the pupils of both eyes much dilated&#x27;, an almost certain indication that a seizure had occurred. No autopsy was carried out (there being no qualified pathologist available) but from the eye-witness accounts it has been argued that Landon suffered a fatal convulsion. Hall notes in &quot;Retrospect&quot; that Maclean refused Hall&#x27;s attempts to erect a statue in honour of Landon, and that her funeral services were shrouded in secrecy: &quot;on the evening of her death she was buried in the courtyard of Cape Coast Castle. The grave was dug by torchlight amid a pitiless torrent of rain&quot; (&quot;Retrospect&quot;, pp. 397–398). Mrs. Hall and I strove to raise money to place a monument there; but objection was made, and the project was abandoned. Lady Blessington directed a slab to be placed at her expense on the wall. That, also, was objected to. But her husband, for very shame, at last permitted it to be done, and a mural table records that in that African courtyard rests all that is mortal of Letitia Elizabeth Maclean. (&quot;Retrospect&quot;, p. 398)

This is another example of the disinformation being circulated at the time, see above, and in fact the immediate burial was due to the climate and all the European residents attended with William Topp reading the funeral service. The sudden tropical rainstorm came subsequently during the preparation of the grave. Blanchard states that It was the immediate wish of Mr. Maclean to place above this grave a suitable memorial, and his desire was expressed in the earliest letter which he sent to England; but we believe that some delay took place in the execution of the order he issued, from the necessity of referring back to the Coast for information as to the intended site of the monument, in order that it might be prepared accordingly. &quot;A handsome marble tablet&quot; is now, it appears, on its way to Cape Coast, to be erected in the castle. Neither Hall nor Lady Blessington had any part in it, although Lady Blessington was hoping to erect a memorial in Brompton.

== Character sketches ==
Landon&#x27;s appearance and personality were described by a number of her friends and contemporaries:

Emma Roberts, from her introduction to &quot;The Zenana and other works&quot;:

L.E.L. could not be, strictly speaking, called handsome; her eyes being the only good feature in a countenance, which was, however, so animated, and lighted up with such intellectual expression, as to be exceedingly attractive. Gay and piquant, her clear complexion, dark hair, and eyes, rendered her, when in health and spirits, a sparkling brunette. The prettiness of L.E.L., though generally acknowledged, was not talked about; and many persons, on their first introduction, were as pleasingly surprised as the Ettrick Shepherd, who, gazing upon her with great admiration, exclaimed &quot;I did na think ye had been sae bonny.&quot; Her figure was slight, and beautifully proportioned, with little hands and feet; and these personal advantages, added to her kind and endearing manners, rendered her exceedingly fascinating.

William Jerdan, from his autobiography:

In truth, she was the most unselfish of human creatures; and it was quite extraordinary to witness her ceaseless consideration for the feelings of others, even in minute trifles, whilst her own mind was probably troubled and oppressed; a sweet disposition, so perfectly amiable, from Nature&#x27;s fount, and so unalterable in its manifestations throughout her entire life, that every one who enjoyed her society loved her, and servants, companions, intimates, friends, all united in esteem and affection for the gentle and self-sacrificing being who never exhibited a single trait of egotism, presumption, or unkindliness!

Anna Maria Hall, from &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;:

Perhaps the greatest magic she exercised was, that, after the first rush of remembrance of all that wonderful young woman had written had subsided, she rendered you completely oblivious of what she had done by the irresistible charm of what she was. You forgot all about her books, – you only felt the intense delight of life with her; she was penetrating and sympathetic, and entered into your feelings so entirely that you wondered how &quot;the little witch&quot; could read you so readily and so rightly, – and if, now and then, you were startled, perhaps dismayed, by her wit, it was but the prick of a diamond arrow. Words and thoughts that she flung hither and thither, without design or intent beyond the amusement of the moment, come to me still with a mingled thrill of pleasure and pain that I cannot describe, and that my most friendly readers, not having known her, could not understand.

Anne Elwood, from her &quot;Memoirs of Literary Ladies&quot;:

It was her invariable habit to write in her bed-room, – &quot;a homely-looking, almost uncomfortable room, fronting the street, and barely furnished – with a simple white bed, at the foot of which was a small, old, oblong-shaped sort of dressing-table, quite covered with a common worn writing-desk, heaped with papers, while some strewed the ground, the table being too small for aught besides the desk. A little high-backed cane chair, which gave you any idea but that of comfort, and a few books scattered about, completed the author&#x27;s paraphernalia.&quot;

Emma Roberts again:

She not only read, but thoroughly understood, and entered into the merits of every book that came out; while it is merely necessary to refer to her printed works, to calculate the amount of information which she had gathered from preceding authors. The history and literature of all ages and all countries were familiar to her; nor did she acquire any portion of her knowledge in a superficial manner; the extent of her learning, and the depth of her research, manifesting themselves in publications which do not bear her name; her claim to them being only known to friends, who, like myself, had access to her desk, and with whom she knew the secret might be safely trusted.

Her depth of reading is confirmed by Laman Blanchard in his Life, who states:

To those who, looking at the quantity of her published prose and poetry, might wonder how she found time for all these private and unproductive exercises of her pen, it may be desirable to explain, not merely that she wrote, but that she read, with remarkable rapidity. Books, indeed, of the highest character, she would dwell upon with &quot;amorous delay;&quot; but those of ordinary interest, or the nine-day wonders of literature, she would run through in a much shorter space of time than would seem consistent with that thorough understanding of their contents at which she always arrived, or with that accurate observation of the less striking features which she would generally prove to have been bestowed, by reference almost to the very page in which they might be noted. Of some work which she scarcely seemed to have glanced through, she would give an elaborate and succinct account, pointing out the gaps in the plot, or the discrepancies in the characters, and supporting her judgment by all but verbatim quotations.

Other contemporaries also praised Landon&#x27;s exceptionally high level of intelligence. Fredric Rowton, in &quot;The Female Poets of Great Britain&quot;, put it thus:

Of Mrs Maclean&#x27;s genius there can be but one opinion. It is distinguished by very great intellectual power, a highly sensitive and ardent imagination, an intense fervour of passionate emotion, and almost unequalled eloquence and fluency. Of mere art she displays but little. Her style is irregular and careless, and her painting sketchy and rough but there is genius in every line she has written.

(Like many others, Rowton is deceived by the artistry of Landon&#x27;s projection of herself as the improvisatrice, L. E. L. As Glennis Stevenson writes, few poets have been as artificial as Landon in her &quot;gushing stream of Song&quot;. She cites the usage of repetition, mirroring and the embedding of texts amongst the techniques that account for the characteristic intensity of Landon&#x27;s poetry.)

== Reputation ==
Among the poets of her own time to recognise and admire Landon were Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who wrote &quot;L.E.L.&#x27;s Last Question&quot; in homage; and Christina Rossetti, who published a tribute poem entitled &quot;L.E.L&quot; in her 1866 volume &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Progress and Other Poems&quot;.

Landon&#x27;s reputation, while high in the 19th century, fell during most of the 20th as literary fashions changed: her poetry was perceived as overly simple and sentimental. However, such criticism had already been addressed by Sarah Sheppard in her &quot;Characteristics of the Genius and Writings of L E L&quot; of 1841. Her opening paragraph runs:

Because they whose decision it is, are subjects of the superficial spirit of the age, which leaves them unacquainted with all of which it appoints them judges. Because, either from a dislike of trouble, or inability to pursue the inquiry, these judges never deviate from their own beaten right line to observe how genius acts and is acted upon,—how it is influenced, and what effects it produces on society. Hence the mistaken opinions concerning literary characters one is often compelled to hear from those who, it is to be feared, know little of what they affirm; and of literary works from those who, it is also to be feared, are not competent to decide on their merits. It is indeed strange with what decision people set their seal of condemnation on volumes beyond whose title-pages they have scarcely looked.

In recent years, scholars and critics have increasingly studied her work, beginning with Germaine Greer in the 1970s. Critics such as Isobel Armstrong argue that the supposed simplicity of poetry such as Landon&#x27;s is deceptive, and that women poets of the 19th century often employed a method of writing which allows for multiple, concurrent levels of meaning. McMullen argues that Landon, although she wrote about what would sell—romance, sensuality, vicariousness, etc, and plays the role of the imitator, actually uses genealogical subversion underneath her words to canonize herself. In mistranslation and retranslation of already quickly canonized Romantic male poets, Landon establishes herself among and even beyond their accomplishments.

Her ideas and the diversity of her poetry engendered a &quot;Landon School&quot;, in England and the United States. As for style, William Howitt comments: &quot;This is one singular peculiarity of the poetry of L. E. L.; and her poetry must be confessed to be peculiar. It is entirely her own. It had one prominent and fixed character, and that character belonged solely to itself. The rhythm, the feeling, the style and phraseology of L. E. L.&#x27;s poetry, were such, that you could immediately recognize it, though the writer&#x27;s name was not mentioned.&quot;

A tribute in &quot;The Literary Gazette&quot;, following Landon&#x27;s death, ran:

To express what we feel on her loss is impossible – and private sorrows of so deep a kind are not for public display: her name will descend to the most distant times, as one of the brightest in the annals of English literature; and whether after ages look at the glowing purity and nature of her first poems, or the more sustained thoughtfulness and vigour of her later works, in prose or in verse, they will cherish her memory as that of one of the most beloved of female authors, the pride and glory of our country while she lived, and the undying delight of succeeding generations. Then, as in our day, young hearts will beat responsive to the thrilling touch of her music; her song of love will find a sacred home in many a fair and ingenuous bosom; her numbers, which breathed of the finest humanities, her playfulness of spirit, and her wonderful delineation of character and society – all – all will be admired, but not lamented as now. She is gone; and, oh, what a light of mind is extinguished: what an amount of friendship and of love has gone down into the grave

== Bibliography ==

In addition to the works listed below, Landon was responsible for numerous anonymous reviews, and other articles whose authorship is unlikely now to be established (compare Emma Roberts above). She also assumed the occasional pseudonym: for one, she adopted the name Iole for a period from 1825 to 1827. Two of her Iole poems, &quot;The Wreck&quot; and &quot;The Frozen Ship&quot;, were later included in the collection, &quot;The Vow of the Peacock&quot;. Mary Mitford said that the novels of Catherine Stepney were honed and polished by Landon, including &quot;The Heir Presumptive&quot; (1835). In the case of &quot;Duty and Inclination&quot;, she is declared as editor but no originator has been named and the extent of Landon&#x27;s involvement is unclear.

On her death, Landon left a list of projected works. Besides the novel &quot;Lady Anne Granard&quot; (first volume completed) and her &quot;tragedy&quot; (&quot;Castruccio Catrucani&quot;), there were: a critical work in 3 volumes to be called &quot;Female Portrait Gallery in Modern Literature&quot; for which she says she has collected a vast amount of material (only some portraits based on Walter Scott were produced); a romance called &quot;Charlotte Corday&quot; for which a plan was sketched plus a &quot;chapter or two&quot;; and a projected 2 volume work on &quot;travels in the country I am about to visit, including the history of the slave trade of which I shall [have] the opportunity of collecting so many curious facts&quot;.

In 2000, scholar Cynthia Lawford published birth records implying that Landon had in fact borne children in the 1820s from a secret affair with William Jerdan. Details of Letitia&#x27;s children by Jerdan (Ella, Fred and Laura) and their descendants can be found in Susan Matoff.

Unity Cable Network was commissioned in March 2010.

In January 2010, Singtel announced it had signed an agreement to join a consortium to build and operate the new SJC (cable system) system (SJC). The construction of the SJC cable system started in April 2011 and became operational in June 2013.

== Incidents ==

=== Bukit Panjang Exchange fire ===

On 9 October 2013, a fire broke out at one of Singtel&#x27;s major Internet exchanges at Bukit Panjang. The fire started at around 2 p.m. Firemen from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) responded to the emergency call placed at 2.16pm and extinguished the fires in 20 minutes. After SCDF had cleared the building for access at 6pm, Singtel started repairing the damaged cable infrastructure. The repairs was initially assessed to be done by 10 October 2013, 7am with 33 cables of fibre strands requiring repairs. However, the repairs was slower than expected as it was difficult to identify the affected cables as visual indicators such as colour coding on the cables were rendered unusable and 116 other fibre cables required repairs as well. Connectivity to affected customers was progressively restored as the repairs stretched into the evening.

The damage incurred extensive connectivity issues in the North Western areas of Singapore, particularly in Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang, Bukit Timah, Choa Chu Kang, Kranji, Marsiling, Teck Whye and Woodlands. Singtel reported 100 mobile base stations were affected, disconnecting its mobile service subscribers in the area. It also reported that around 60,000 fixed broadband lines, 46,000 mioTV subscribers, and 30,000 voice lines were also affected. OpenNet also reported that 81 of its fibre cables were damaged, affecting 46,000 fibre connections downstream. Business such as StarHub, M1, DBS, OpenNet and Singapore Pools saw varying levels of disruptions to their services and operations islandwide.

The cables were reconnected on 11 October 2013. However, there were still some subscribers whose connectivity services were still disrupted as of 16 October 2013. StarHub indicated that some of the repaired OpenNet cables, which it relied on to carry its fibre internet services, were not connected properly. Likewise, Singtel reported that several cables required further rectification works. Both offered alternate connectivity solutions to the affected subscribers as a temporary measure while further work took place, with StarHub sending cable modems to its affected subscribers to connect to its then existing coaxial cable network (which could carry Internet services, and was put to an end in June 2019), and Singtel sending mobile broadband dongles. Singtel also announced compensation packages to its affected subscribers of its various services.

Singtel had set up a Board Committee of Inquiry (BCOI) to investigate the fire. Additionally, the BCOI would also benchmark current network design and contingency processes against international best practices and standards, and recommend appropriate improvements to prevent future occurrences and strengthen network resilience. Separately, IDA had launched an investigation into the fire as well. Questions were raised in the public on the infrastructure design of the telecommunications network. The fire exposed the fact that Bukit Panjang exchange was a single point of failure as connectivity services of 3 major ISPs were affected due to it, with the affected OpenNet fibre cables affecting a wide area across the nation.

Preliminary findings realised by Singtel on 6 November 2013 indicated that the fire broke out during a maintenance work at one of the lead-in pipes located in the cable chamber. The fire was caused by an employee not following the maintenance procedures as well as the use of an unauthorised blowtorch. Maintenance protocols had since strengthened, limiting maintenance work which required heat to be applied and reinforcing training on safety requirements and operations. The BCOI report, dated 9 December 2013, was released on 17 December 2013. The report covered three main areas: fire prevention in exchanges, network reliability and resiliency, as well as public relations and communications. Singtel&#x27;s board has accepted the BCOI&#x27;s findings and would implement its recommendations. In Singtel&#x27;s 2015 annual report, it was reported that the BCOI was satisfied that all the recommendations of the BCOI had been followed up and adequately addressed.

Singtel was later fined $6 million Singapore dollars for the fire incident, it is the largest fine for a telco company in Singapore history. National fibre broadband network builder OpenNet and CityNet - the trustee manager of a Singtel unit that owns OpenNet - have also been fined $200,000 and $300,000, respectively, for failing to comply with safety procedures and restore services promptly.

=== Gushcloud marketing scandal ===
On 14 March 2015, Xiaxue, a Singapore-based blogger, revealed on her blog instructions from Gushcloud to its network of bloggers to post complaints about the mobile services of Singtel&#x27;s rivalling mobile service providers, StarHub and M1, on social media, in a marketing effort to drive subscriptions of a new mobile service plan targeted at youths by Singtel. Along with her revelation, there were many samples of Gushcloud&#x27;s bloggers taking up the offer and posting complaints up on social media services. Upon the release of the complaints, both Starhub and M1 called on IDA to investigate the matter.

Initially denying that it had issued the brief, Singtel issued an apology, of which Starhub and M1 had accepted. Singtel also terminated its employee who had worked with Gushcloud on the campaign as the employee did not adhere to Singtel&#x27;s professional standards and values. At the same time, Singtel ended its relationship with Gushcloud. Vincent Ha, Gushcloud&#x27;s chief executive, released an apology through the firm on the firm&#x27;s use of negative messaging and yet criticising Xiaxue&#x27;s expose for &quot;doing more harm than good to our industry&quot;. Xiaxue refuted the statement, saying he was trying to divert blame and calling Gushcloud&#x27;s actions as &quot;not ethical&quot;. Several bloggers involved issued apologies on their platforms as well.

=== Data breach incident ===
On 12 February 2020, Singtel was fined $9,000 Singapore dollars for a data breach incident involving the My Singtel mobile app, a smartphone application owned by Singtel. The incident began from Singtel encountering a technical issue during its migration to a new billing system in early 2018, resulting in the personal data of 750 mobile subscribers being exposed. Of these, 39 subscribers&#x27; personal data were in fact accessed by other subscribers over a period of about 11 hours.

=== Assistant manager leaking client data and thieving ===
Pleo Sherwin Cubos was an assistant manager at Singtel earning around $5000 Singapore dollar income, he borrowed $500 Singapore dollars in January 2020 from an unlicensed moneylender after seeing an advertisement for illegal loans on Facebook ads. Cubos later obtained more loans when he couldn&#x27;t resolve his debt problems, his debt also continued to increase and he was unable to pay the debt, Cubos begin to receive loan shark harassment.

Cubos&#x27; debtor, Alan, later offered Cubos to stop loan shark harassment on him if he could access Singtel&#x27;s internal data system (CRM) and using the given information to find and sharing the borrower&#x27;s data with Alan. Alan gave Cubos a list of identity card numbers and phone numbers of his borrower for Cubos to find the client&#x27;s data in the CRM. Between 20 February 2020 to 25 April 2020, Cubos unauthorized screenshotted 27 client&#x27;s data on the CRM and sent 6 client&#x27;s data to Alan.

In March and April 2020, Cubos sold a total of 3 iPads that belong to Singtel for at least $250 Singapore dollars and spent the money on his personal expenses.

Cubos&#x27; supervisor later discovered his offences and filed a police report on 2 May 2020. Cubos was then charged and pleaded guilty to one count each of assisting a loan shark and criminal breach of trust charge on 30 December 2020. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 months 3 weeks and fined $30,000 Singapore dollars.

=== Retail consultant selling client data ===
Kelvin Foo Cheek Ann was a retail consultant at the Singtel outlet in Parkway Parade. Between 2014 and July 2017, he obtained Singtel&#x27;s client data from Singtel&#x27;s system without authorization and sold the data to his acquaintance, Lee Cheng Yan, as requested. Lee offered him $20 Singapore dollars for each mobile number checked on the system. All clients whose data sold were later received harassment calls, messages, and strangers appearing at their homes and demanding money.

Foo took a total of $180 Singapore dollars of bribes from Lee. Foo pleaded guilty to 1 charge of corruption, 5 charges of unauthorized access to Singtel&#x27;s system, and 10 charges were taken into consideration during sentencing.

=== Zero-day attack ===
On 11 February 2021, Singtel issued a statement admitting the company had been attacked by hackers in Zero-day attack which resulted in a data breach. Singtel CEO Yuen Kuan Moon issued a public apology regarding the incident, which was caused by a vulnerability in an Accellion file-sharing system used by Singtel. Accellion issued its first alert of the exploits in December 2020, Singtel then applied a series of patches provided by Accellion to resolve the vulnerability. On 23 January 2021, Accellion stated that a new vulnerability had emerged and patches previously applied in December 2020 are ineffective. Singtel immediately took its system offline since. Singtel&#x27;s attempt to patch the new vulnerability in the FTA system on 30 January 2021 triggered an anomaly alert, and Accellion later informed that the system might have been breached. Singtel&#x27;s investigations later confirmed the system was breached and identified 20 January 2021 as the occurrence day.
=== Amobee executives plead guilty to hijacking IP addresses in order to send illegal spam ===
On 10 June 2022, three employees of the affiliate marketing platform Amobee pleaded guilty in federal court to hijacking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to send unsolicited commercial email messages, commonly known as “spam.”

<doc id="375472" wikidata="Q228622" url="?curid=375472" title="38M Toldi">
<text>The Toldi was a Hungarian light tank of World War II, developed on the basis of the Swedish Landsverk L-60. It was named after the 14th century Hungarian knight Miklós Toldi. The Toldi was made in several different variants including some armed with a 20 mm gun, some armed with a 40 mm gun, some fitted with &quot;schürzen&quot; plates, and even a prototype tank destroyer variant armed with a 75 mm gun. At least one was even fitted with heavy anti-tank rocket launchers.

== Development and production ==
The Hungarian general staff wanted a modern light tank as soon as possible, after the domestically developed V-4 turned out to be too expensive by 1936 and work on it progressed slower than expected.

Meanwhile, the Swedish AB Landsverk finished its recent development, the Landsverk L-60 in October, and was looking for a customer to cover the costs. After a series of trials in 1937 with the V-4 and the Panzer I, the MÁVAG heavy industries decided to purchase the license of the L-60, with a prototype for further development.

The turret of the vehicle was then modified, making space for the radio and other devices, with a cupola being placed on top (since the L-60 was still unfinished and lacked in many necessary features). The original main armament, the 20 mm Madsen was also replaced initially by a 25 mm Bofors autocannon, and then by the 20 mm Solothurn anti-tank rifle, as it was already in service in the Hungarian army. The hull would then be changed on the front, upper sides, and rear, to riveted plates instead of welded for faster and easier production, with the original Scania-Vabis 1664 engine being replaced by the German Büssing L8V.

At first, 80 vehicles were ordered from MÁVAG, then an order for 110 more vehicles were placed in 1940. In total, 202 units were produced.

== Variants ==
* 38M Toldi I (A20) - first variant armed with a 20 mm Solothurn anti-tank rifle, 80 made. The very first few Toldis received the older versions of 20mm AT rifles with their sizeable magazines, so a small bump was formed on the turret roof to make it easier to insert the magazines. With the introduction of the new magazines, this became unnecessary and the other Toldis no longer had such &quot;bump&quot;. At the beginning of the production (similarly to the Soviet and Italian armored vehicles of the time) there were many errors due to inexperience, so broken welds, armor cracks and casting errors in the track links were common. 
* 42M Toldi II (B20) - 110 made. This version was equipped with more reliable engines manufactured under license by Ganz instead of the imported NAGs. Furthermore, the suspensions have been improved with stronger torsion springs. These vehicles were extremely reliable (compared to the Russian and German tanks of the time) and were able to achieve a service life of 7-8000 kms with one planned factory repair. These vehicles were fitted with a slightly increased turret, which provided better placement of the radio and slightly better comfort. With the help of the large emergency exit hatches, the crew could quickly leave the damaged tanks.
* 42M Toldi IIA (B40) - modification developed in 1942, armed with the 37/42M 40 mm gun and a larger turret. In 1943, 80 Toldis in the best condition were equipped with the gun and the additional armor plates, increasing the frontal protection to 35mm (280 BHN!).
* 43M Toldi III (C40) - improved variant with thicker armor, 42M gun, upgraded drivetrain and perforated &quot;schürzen&quot; plates. According to recollections, 12 were made, but there is no written evidence of this, so it is possible that they were ordered and the production process has started, but never completed because of the bombing raids.
* 43M Toldi Páncélvadász (&#x27;Toldi tank hunter&#x27;) - Toldi hull with a German 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank gun in an open casemate. Only 1 prototype made since the Germans did not deliver the guns ordered and paid for due to the war situation.
* Toldi II armed with heavy anti-tank rocket launchers - modified Toldi II with its gun removed and a twin mount for 44M Buzogányvető heavy anti-tank rocket launchers mounted on the rear of its turret. One photograph is known to exist of this variant, so at least 1 made.

== Combat ==

The Toldi tanks first saw action with the Hungarian Army in the 1941 Invasion of Yugoslavia. These tanks were then mostly used against the USSR between 1941 and 1944. Because of their light armour, armament and good communications equipment, they were mostly used for reconnaissance. The design was effective against Soviet light tanks widespread during the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, such as the obsolete T-26 and BT-5. However it was totally inadequate against the Soviet T-34 medium tanks encountered during the later stages of the war on the Eastern Front. From 1940 to the end of 1942, Toldi tanks served in 22-vehicle-strong companies and there were also 7 tanks in the HQ sections.

After 1942, it was clear that the light tanks in service around the world at that time were no longer suitable for offensive operations. However, Toldi tanks were suitable for reconnaissance and flanking tasks. Furthermore, in order to save fuel and spare medium tanks, they were ideal for the basic training tank crews.

In light of this, from 1943 in the &quot;Szabolcs&quot; order of battle, the Toldi companies were disbanded and 5-5 Toldis were placed in the medium tank companies. In addition to training tasks, they performed the scouting and flanking missions for the unit. They were suitable for this thanks to better mobility, outstanding optics and good radios compared to T-60 and T-70 tanks. In addition, 9 Toldi were converted into medical evacuation vehicles. Thus, each medium tank company had 11-17 Turans (due to the lack of vehicles, not every company was replenished as required) and 5 Toldis.In addition, each battalion and regiment HQ had 5 Toldis and 1 Medevac variant. Usually 50-50% were B20s and B40s in these units. The exception to this was the 1st Cavalry Division, which had no Toldis in its Turán companies. Two dozen A20 Toldis were used as command vehicles of the Nimród SPAA squadrons and Zrínyi assault gun companies. The rest were used for training purposes after 1943. 

== Service history ==
The Toldi entered Hungarian service in 1940. They were used extensively in the Invasion of Yugoslavia and on the Eastern Front. From 1942, the Toldis were reassigned to reconnaissance, command and ambulance roles.

The Toldis fought throughout the war, but due to the siege of Budapest, the supply of spare parts ceased in late 1944, so the tanks began to suffer losses due to wear and tear too (by this time, all the Toldis and Nimróds had already accumulated more than 5,000 kms!). Although it was ineffective against the T-34 and IS tanks, the Toldi B40 had a chance against almost 40% of the Soviet armoured vehicles in 1944 (T-70, SU-76, BA-64, etc.) and it was able to evade heavier tanks due to its excellent maneuverability and small size.

Several Toldi tanks were captured by the USSR late in the war, two of them were transported to Kubinka for testing and are still preserved there.

A few Toldis were captured by the Romanians after Romania switched sides following the 1944 coup d&#x27;état. Their fate is unknown.

== Survivors ==

Two Toldi tanks (one Toldi I and one Toldi IIA) are preserved on display at the Kubinka Tank Museum in Moscow, Russia. It can be seen that on the surviving 38M Toldi I the gun mantlet, guns, lights and rails have been modified or removed, and the right fender is damaged.

<text>John Forster (2 April 1812 – 2 February 1876) was a Victorian English biographer and literary critic.

==Life==

Forster was born at &quot;a little yellow house&quot; in Fenkle Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, second of four children of Unitarian cattle-dealer Robert Forster (died 1836) and Mary (c. 1780-1852), daughter of a Gallowgate dairy farm keeper. Forster&#x27;s great-grandfather had been &quot;a man of some considerable substance&quot;, a landowner at Corsenside in Northumberland; his grandfather Christopher (the third son) inherited nothing, so this branch became butchers and cattle-dealers in Newcastle. Forster&#x27;s father &quot;married beneath himself&quot; despite his wife being &quot;a gem of a woman&quot;; she was remembered by a nephew as &quot;kind and affectionate&quot;, giving her impoverished sister&#x27;s children cast-off clothing. The Forsters subsequently lived on Low Friar Street and at 5, Green Court, all &quot;in the centre of old Newcastle... a jumble of houses, works and potteries&quot;. John Forster was educated in classics and in mathematics at The Royal Grammar School. Forster in 1828 matriculated at the University of Cambridge, but after only a month&#x27;s residence there he moved to London, where he attended classes at University College London, and entered the Inner Temple.

In London, Forster successfully contributed to &quot;The True Sun&quot;, &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Examiner&quot;, for which he was literary and dramatic critic. An extract of his &quot;Lives of the Statesmen of the Commonwealth&quot; (1836–1839) was published in Lardner&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet Cyclopaedia&quot;. Forster subsequently published the entire work separately in 1840, with his &quot;Treatise on the Popular Progress in English History&quot;, both of which were publicly commended, and as a consequence of which Forster became reputable amongst London literary society. He therein became a friend of Leigh Hunt, Charles Lamb, W. S. Landor, Charles Dickens (every work by whom he read in manuscript), and Edward Bulwer-Lytton (whom he monetarily patronised during the latter&#x27;s childhood ). Forster was engaged to Letitia Landon, but after their relationship was broken off he instead married Eliza, the widow of Henry Colburn.

Forster in 1843 was called to the bar, but he did not ever practise as a lawyer.

Forster in 1855 was appointed secretary to the Lunacy Commission and, from 1861 to 1872, held the office of a Commissioner in Lunacy. His valuable collection of manuscripts, including original copies of Charles Dickens&#x27;s novels, together with his books and pictures, was bequeathed to the South Kensington Museum.

==Works==

For some years he edited the &quot;Foreign Quarterly Review&quot;; in 1846, on the retirement of Charles Dickens, he took over &quot;The Daily News&quot;; and, from 1847 to 1856 he edited the &quot;Examiner&quot;. From 1836 onwards, he contributed to the &quot;Edinburgh Quarterly Review&quot; and to the &quot;Foreign Quarterly Review&quot; a variety of articles, some of which were republished in two volumes of &quot;Biographical and Historical Essays&quot; (1858).

In 1848 appeared his admirable &quot;Life and Times of Oliver Goldsmith&quot; (revised 1854). Continuing his researches into English history under the early Stuarts, he published in 1860 the &quot;Arrest of the Five Members by Charles I: a Chapter of English History rewritten&quot;, and &quot;The Debates on the Grand Remonstrance, with an Introductory Essay on English Freedom&quot;. These were followed by his &quot;Sir John Eliot: a Biography&quot; (1864), elaborated from one of his earlier studies for the &quot;Lives of Eminent British Statesmen&quot;.

In 1868 appeared his &quot;Life of Landor&quot;. On the death of his friend Alexander Dyce, Forster undertook the publication of his third edition of Shakespeare. For several years he had been collecting materials for a life of Jonathan Swift, but he interrupted his studies in this direction to write his standard &quot;Life of Charles Dickens&quot;. He had long been intimate with the novelist, and it is by this work that John Forster is now chiefly remembered. The first volume appeared in 1872, and the biography was completed in 1874. It was clearly an important work for the late nineteenth century English novelist George Gissing, who wrote, in his diary in January 1888, that, it was &quot;a book I constantly take up for impulse, when work at a standstill&quot;. A decade or so later, Gissing was asked to revise Forster&#x27;s work, and this was published, by Chapman and Hall, in October 1902.

Towards the close of 1875 the first volume of his &quot;Life of Swift&quot; was published; and he had made some progress in the preparation of the second at the time of his death.

==In fiction==
Forster has been fictionalised in several recent neo-Victorian novels which centre on Charles Dickens. This includes &quot;The Last Dickens&quot; by Matthew Pearl (2009), &quot;Wanting&quot; by Richard Flanagan (2008), &quot;Girl in a Blue Dress&quot; by Gaynor Arnold (2008, renamed Michael O&#x27;Rourke), &quot;Drood&quot; by Dan Simmons (2009) and the forensic examination of the genesis of &quot;Pickwick Papers&quot;, &quot;Death and Mr Pickwick&quot; by Stephen Jarvis (2014) in which Forster is cast as the major villain of the piece. He was portrayed by Justin Edwards in the 2017 film &quot;The Man Who Invented Christmas&quot;. The film portrays Forster as Dickens&#x27; unofficial business manager and engaged to a Miss Charlotte Wigmore, a fictional character. It also implies that Forster was Dickens&#x27; inspiration for the Ghost of Christmas Present.

<doc id="375474" wikidata="Q313572" url="?curid=375474" title="Abel Gance">
<text>Abel Gance (; born Abel Eugène Alexandre Péréthon; 25 October 188910 November 1981) was a French film director, producer, writer and actor. A pioneer in the theory and practice of montage, he is best known for three major silent films: &quot;J&#x27;accuse&quot; (1919), &quot;La Roue&quot; (1923), and &quot;Napoléon&quot; (1927).

==Early life==

Born in Paris in 1889, Abel Gance was the illegitimate son of a prosperous doctor, Abel Flamant, and a working-class mother, Françoise Péréthon (or Perthon). Initially taking his mother&#x27;s name, he was brought up until the age of eight by his maternal grandparents in the coal-mining town of Commentry in central France. He then returned to Paris to rejoin his mother, who had by then married Adolphe Gance, a chauffeur and mechanic, whose name Abel then adopted.

Although he later fabricated the history of a brilliant school career and middle-class background, Gance left school at the age of 14, and the love of literature and art which sustained him throughout his life was in part the result of self-education. He started working as a clerk in a solicitor&#x27;s office, but after a couple of years he turned to acting in the theatre. When he was 18, he was given a season&#x27;s contract at the Théâtre Royal du Parc in Brussels, where he developed friendships with the actor Victor Francen and the writer Blaise Cendrars.

== Silent films ==

While in Brussels, Gance wrote his first film scenarios, which he sold to Léonce Perret. Back in Paris in 1909, he acted in his first film, Perret&#x27;s &quot;Molière&quot;. At that stage, he regarded the cinema as &quot;infantile and stupid&quot; and was only drawn into film jobs by his poverty, but he nevertheless continued to write scenarios, and often sold them to Gaumont. During this period he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, often fatal at that time, but after a period of retreat in Vittel he recovered. With some friends, he established a production company, Le Film Français, and began directing his own films in 1911 with &quot;La Digue (ou Pour sauver la Hollande)&quot;, a historical film which featured the first screen appearance of Pierre Renoir.
Gance tried to maintain a connection with the theatre and he finished writing a monumental tragedy entitled &quot;Victoire de Samothrace&quot;, in which he hoped that Sarah Bernhardt would star. Its five-hour length, and Gance&#x27;s refusal to cut it, proved to be a stumbling block.
With the outbreak of World War I, Gance was rejected by the army on medical grounds, and in 1915 he started writing and directing for a new film company, . He soon caused controversy with &quot;La Folie du docteur Tube&quot;, a comic fantasy in which he and his cameraman Léonce-Henri Burel created some arresting visual effects with distorting mirrors. The producers were outraged and refused to show the film. Gance nevertheless continued working for Film d&#x27;Art until 1918, making over a dozen commercially successful films. His experiments included tracking shots, extreme close-ups, low-angle shots, and split-screen images. His subjects moved steadily away from simple action films towards psychological melodramas, such as &quot;Mater dolorosa&quot; (1917) starring Emmy Lynn as a neglected wife who has an affair with her husband&#x27;s brother. The film was a great commercial success, and it was followed by &quot;La Dixième Symphonie&quot;, another marital drama featuring Emmy Lynn. Here Gance&#x27;s mastery of lighting, composition and editing was accompanied by a range of literary and artistic references which some critics found pretentious and alienating.

In 1917, Gance was finally drafted into the army, in its Service Cinématographique, an episode which proved futile and short-lived, but it deepened his preoccupation with the impact of the war and the depression which was caused by the deaths of many of his friends. When he parted company with Film d&#x27;Art over a shortage of funds, Charles Pathé stepped in to underwrite his next film, &quot;J&#x27;accuse&quot; (1919), in which Gance confronted the waste and suffering which the war had brought. He re-enlisted in the Service Cinématographique in order to be able to film some scenes on a real battlefield at the front. The film made a powerful impact and went on to have international distribution.

In 1920, Gance developed his next project, &quot;La Roue&quot;, while recuperating in Nice from Spanish flu, and its progress was deeply affected by the knowledge that his companion Ida Danis was dying of tuberculosis; furthermore, his leading man and friend Séverin-Mars was also seriously ill (and died soon after completion of the film). Nevertheless, Gance brought an unprecedented level of energy and imagination to the technical realisation of his story, set firstly against the dark and grimy background of locomotives and railway yards, and then among the snow-covered landscapes of the Alps. He employed elaborate editing techniques and innovative use of rapid cutting which made the film highly influential among other contemporary directors. The finished film was originally in 32 reels and ran for nearly nine hours, but it was subsequently edited down for distribution. A modern reconstruction from five different versions, available on DVD, is nearly four and a half hours long, and an almost seven hours long restored version was shown at the 2019 Lumière Film Festival.

In 1921, Gance visited America to promote &quot;J&#x27;accuse&quot;. During his five-month stay he met D. W. Griffith, whom he had long admired. He was also offered a contract with MGM to work in Hollywood, but he turned it down.

After a brief change of pace for &quot;Au Secours!&quot; (1924), a comic film with Max Linder, Gance embarked on his greatest project, a six-part life of &quot;Napoléon&quot;. Only the first part was completed, tracing Bonaparte&#x27;s early life, through the Revolution, and up to the invasion of Italy, but even this occupied a vast canvas with meticulously recreated historical scenes and scores of characters. The film was full of experimental techniques, combining rapid cutting, hand-held cameras, superimposition of images, and, in wide-screen sequences, shot using a system he called Polyvision needing triple cameras (and projectors), achieved a spectacular panoramic effect, including a finale in which the outer two film panels were tinted blue and red, creating a widescreen image of a French flag. The original version of the film ran for around 6 hours. A shortened version received a triumphant première at the Paris Opéra in April 1927 before a distinguished audience that included the future General de Gaulle. The length was reduced still further for French and European distribution, and it became even shorter when it was shown in America. This was not the end of the film&#x27;s career however. Gance re-used material from it in later films, and the restoration of the silent film at the beginning of the 1980s confirmed it as his best known work.

==Sound films==
Gance embraced the arrival of sound with enthusiasm, and his first production was &quot;La Fin du monde&quot; (1931), an expensive science-fiction film (first planned in 1913/14) about the imminent collision of a comet with the Earth. Gance himself played the leading role. The film was a critical and commercial disaster, and thereafter the creative independence which Gance had enjoyed in the previous decade was seriously curtailed.

Gance continued to be a busy film-maker throughout the 1930s, but he characterised most of the films made during this period as ones that he did &quot;not in order to live, but in order not to die&quot;. In 1932 he tried to demonstrate his credentials as a reliable and efficient director by filming a remake of &quot;Mater dolorosa&quot; which he completed within 18 days and within budget. Among the other &#x27;commercial&#x27; works that followed were &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot; (1935), with Edwige Feuillère, and &quot;Un Grand Amour de Beethoven&quot; (1937), with Harry Baur. One of the more personal projects that he was able to undertake was a new version of &quot;J&#x27;accuse!&quot; (1938), not so much a remake of his 1919 film as a continuation of it, and conceived as a warning against the new war that he saw impending. His next film &quot;Paradis perdu&quot;, a melodrama about the First World War, proved successful when it was released after the Fall of France in 1940.

Gance then filmed a popular melodrama called &quot;Vénus aveugle&quot;, which he saw as an allegory of the current state of France and a message of hope directed to the ordinary French people in their time of misfortune. That year, Gance was denounced as a Jew, and was trying to get his name removed from the list of non-aryens forbidden to practice their profession. At the feat of pursuing his work, Gance complied with the Vichy government and was among those who saw Philippe Pétain as the means of the country&#x27;s salvation. In September 1941 &quot;Vénus aveugle&quot; had its first screening in Vichy, preceded by a speech in which Gance paid tribute to Pétain. After completing one more film, &quot;Le Capitaine Fracasse&quot;, Gance eventually fled to Spain in August 1943, citing growing hostility from the German authorities in France, and he remained there until October 1945.

After the war, his difficulties in getting support for his projects increased, and thus he made few films. The historical melodrama &quot;La Tour de Nesle&quot; (1954) was his first film in colour, and it provoked some revival of interest in his work, with critics such as François Truffaut making the case for Gance as a neglected &quot;auteur&quot; of genius.

Gance returned to Napoleonic spectacle with &quot;Austerlitz&quot; (1960), and made a further historical pageant in &quot;Cyrano et d&#x27;Artagnan&quot; (1963), before moving into television for his final works, also on historical subjects.

Throughout his life Gance kept returning to &quot;Napoléon&quot;, often editing his own footage into shorter versions, adding a soundtrack, sometimes filming new material, and as a result the original 1927 film was lost from view for decades. After various attempts at reconstruction, the dedicated work of the film historian Kevin Brownlow produced a five-hour version of the film, still incomplete but fuller than anyone had seen since the 1920s. This version was presented at the Telluride Film Festival in August 1979, with the frail 89-year-old director in attendance. The occasion brought a belated triumph to Gance&#x27;s career, and subsequent performances and further restoration made his name known to a worldwide audience.

Abel Gance married three times: in 1912 to Mathilde Thizeau; in 1922 to Marguerite Danis (sister of Ida); and in 1933 to Marie-Odette Vérité (Sylvie Grenade), who died in 1978. Gance died of tuberculosis in Paris in 1981 at the age of 92. Abel Gance was interred in the Cimetière d&#x27;Auteuil in Paris.

==Reputation==
Gance wanted himself to be seen as &quot;the Victor Hugo of the screen&quot;, and many assessments have recognised the ambition, the ingenuity and the sweeping romanticism of his films. Some, such as Léon Moussinac in the 1920s, have pointed to the contradictions in his work between creativity and cliché, the &quot;abundance of original treasures and of banal mediocrity and of poor taste&quot;.

One thing that has always been acknowledged is Gance&#x27;s innovations in the techniques of the cinema. As well as his multiscreen ventures with Polyvision, he explored the use of superimposition of images, extreme close-ups, and fast rhythmic editing, and he made the camera mobile in unorthodox ways – hand-held, mounted on wires or a pendulum, or even strapped to a horse. He also made early experiments with the addition of sound to film, and with filming in colour and in 3-D. There were few aspects of film technique that he did not seek to incorporate in his work, and his influence was acknowledged by contemporaries such as Jean Epstein and later by the French New Wave film-makers. In the assessment of Kevin Brownlow, &quot;...with his silent productions, &quot;J&#x27;accuse&quot;, &quot;La Roue&quot;, and &quot;Napoléon&quot;, [Abel Gance] made a fuller use of the medium than anyone before or since&quot;.

Another aspect of Gance&#x27;s work which has drawn comment from critics is the political stance and implication of his life and films, particularly his identification with strong military leaders. Whereas &quot;J&#x27;accuse&quot; in 1919 suggested Gance&#x27;s pacifist and anti-establishment attitude, the reactions to &quot;Napoléon&quot; in 1927 saw greater ambivalence, and some commentators even judged it to be an apologia for dictatorship. This strand of criticism of Gance&#x27;s reactionary politics has continued through later assessments of him; it has also noted his ardent support for Pétain in the early years of World War II, and subsequently for Charles de Gaulle in the 1960s. Others have regarded these political interpretations as secondary to Gance&#x27;s mastery of exuberant spectacle, which frequently had a nationalistic focus. As one obituary concluded, &quot;Abel Gance was perhaps the greatest Romantic of the screen&quot;.

== Jury ==

<text>China Mobile is the trade name of both China Mobile Limited and its ultimate controlling shareholder, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd., a Chinese state-owned telecommunications company. It provides mobile voice and multimedia services through its nationwide mobile telecommunications network across mainland China and Hong Kong. China Mobile is the largest wireless carrier in China, with 945.50 million subscribers as of June 2021. China Mobile was ranked #25 in Forbes&#x27; Global 2000 in 2023.

China Mobile Limited is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It is the world&#x27;s largest mobile network operator by total number of subscribers, and the world&#x27;s largest telecommunications company by revenue.

, China Mobile Limited&#x27;s total market value stood at HK$965 billion, which is the largest red chip company.

==History==
Incorporated in 1997 as China Telecom (Hong Kong) Limited, China Mobile was born from the 1999 break-up of China Telecommunications Corporation. This company continues to provide mobile services, however.

In May 2008, the company took over China Tietong, a fixed-line telecom and the then third-largest broadband ISP in China adding Internet services to its core business of mobile services.

In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a $970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.

China Mobile is among the state entities which contribute to the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, which was established in an effort to decrease China&#x27;s reliance on foreign semiconductor companies. The fund was established in 2014.

In December 2021, China Mobile announced that its international arm would cease operations in Canada due to national security concerns by the Canadian government.

=== U.S. sanctions ===
In November 2020, President Donald Trump issued an executive order prohibiting any American company or individual from owning shares in companies that the United States Department of Defense has listed as having links to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which included China Mobile. On 31 December 2020, the New York Stock Exchange announced that it would suspend trading in China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom from 7 to 11 January 2021 and start the delisting process, causing stock values to drop. On 4 January the decision to delist was suddenly reversed; two days later, the NYSE said that the delistings would proceed. In the aftermath of the delisting, the company announced its decision to raise up to US$8.8 billion ahead of the Shanghai stock exchange listing, according to an official Weibo post by the company.

In March 2022, the Federal Communications Commission designated China Mobile&#x27;s U.S. subsidiary, China Mobile International USA, a national security threat.

=== Operations in Russia amid sanctions ===
China Mobile has faced criticism for continuing its operations in Russia despite the international sanctions imposed on the country following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The company&#x27;s decision aligns with the broader trend of major Chinese firms maintaining business as usual in Russia, as noted by monitoring projects such as Yale’s CELI list and the KSE Institute’s &quot;Leave Russia&quot; project. Critics argue that this approach undermines global efforts to isolate Russia economically and politically for its actions in Ukraine. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding China Mobile’s connections to state-owned entities and its role in facilitating cooperation between China and Russia in the telecommunications and media sectors. Such collaborations have been implicated in supporting disinformation campaigns and propaganda, further complicating China Mobile&#x27;s controversial position in the international arena. International authorities and digital security experts have raised concerns about the widespread use of Hikvision and Dahua (of which China Mobile is a significant shareholder) surveillance cameras. According to Ukraine’s State Security Service (SBU), hacked cameras have been used to gather intelligence on critical infrastructure and military movements, posing risks during the ongoing conflict with Russia. For instance, in a missile attack on Kyiv on January 2, 2024, two compromised outdoor cameras were allegedly used to guide the strikes.

==Ownership and control==
A state-owned enterprise directly controlled by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and also a public company which is listed on the NYSE and the Hong Kong stock exchanges, China Mobile has dominated Chinese mobile services since its inception for civilian and military purposes. According to the United States Department of Defense, the company has links to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army. , China Mobile controls the vast majority of its domestic mobile services market with a 70% market share. China Unicom and China Telecom have 20% and 10% shares, respectively.

The company likely enjoys substantial protectionist benefits from China&#x27;s government but also experiences frequent government intervention in its business affairs. Government control is maintained through a presumably government-owned holding company, China Mobile Communications Group Co., Ltd. (formerly: China Mobile Communications Corporation; CMCC), that owns 100 percent ownership of China Mobile (HK) Group Limited, which in turn holds over seventy percent ownership of China Mobile–the remainder being controlled by public investors. Established in 2000, CMCC is China Mobile Ltd&#x27;s current parent company .

China Mobile is one of the &quot;core&quot; central SOEs overseen by State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC).

==Services==
===Rural services===

China Mobile was one of six state-owned companies that implemented the Connecting Every Village Project, which the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began in 2004 to promote universal access to telecommunication and internet services in rural China. The MIIT required that China Mobile and the other state-owned companies build the communications infrastructure and assist in financing the project. 135 million rural households had used broadband internet. The program successfully extended internet infrastructure throughout rural China and promoted development of the internet.

China Mobile has historically held a greater share of the rural market than competitors. By 2006, its network had expanded to provide reception to 97% of the Chinese population, and the company has since seen a sustained stream of new, rural mobile customers.

It also offers services targeted at the rural market including an agricultural information service, which facilitates a variety of activities such as the sale and purchase of agricultural products, access to market prices for produce and crops, wire transfers, bank withdrawals, and payments, etc.

===Overseas activities===
The company branched out in 2007 with the purchase of Paktel in Pakistan launching the Zong brand there a year later.

In 2013, China Mobile eyed expansion into Myanmar expressing interest in bidding for one of two licences on offer in a partnership with Vodafone although this plan ultimately fell through.

===Digital barrier removal===
In 2023, China Mobile&#x27;s digital wallet users were able to make payments by scanning WeChat QR codes as part of a program to remove barriers between the ecosystems of technology companies in China.

==Brands==
===Mainland China===
Mobile services are available in Mainland China under several brands as of 2007. , the below brands are scheduled to be slowly phased out and replaced by an all-encompassing new brand name—And—whose logo combines an exclamation point, the Chinese character for &quot;peace&quot; (), as well as the English word &quot;and&quot;.

;M-zone:
( Rough translation: &quot;Dynamic Area&quot;): a premium prepaid service popular with youths
;Easyown:

( Rough translation: &quot;Travel across China&quot; (lit. &quot;travel the holy states&quot;)): a basic prepaid mobile phone service more heavily marketed in rural areas
;G3:
A 3G service brand using TD-SCDMA (likely introduced post-2007)
;and!和:
A 4G/LTE service brand using TD-LTE

===Hong Kong===
CMHK is a wholly owned subsidiary of China Mobile. It offers GSM, GPRS, EDGE, HSPA+ (MVNO), FD-LTE and TD-LTE technologies to customers in this the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

===Pakistan===
Zong is China Mobile&#x27;s brand in Pakistan and is operated by China Mobile Pakistan (CMPak), a subsidiary.

===United Kingdom===
In December 2017, China Mobile launched a MVNO service in the UK called CMLink. CMLink is aimed at the Chinese population living in the UK and Chinese visitors and students. Plans include free calls to China Mobile phones in China.

=== Singapore ===
In June 2020, China Mobile launched a MVNO service called CMLink. It uses Singtel networks, which is one of Singapore&#x27;s largest mobile network operator.

CMLink is aimed at the Chinese population living in the Singapore and Chinese visitors and students. Plans include free calls to China Mobile phones in China.

==Network==
China Mobile operates a GSM network, which encompasses all 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and directly administered municipalities in mainland China and includes Hong Kong, too. GPRS is utilized for data transmission.

;3G:
Marketed as &quot;G3&quot;, the company controls 70% of the Chinese mobile market but a far smaller percentage of the 3G market. , its nearly 60 million 3G subscribers account for roughly 9% of its total subscriber base, which is an increase from 3% in 2010.

Its 3G network, still under construction in 2010, utilizes the TD-SCDMA standard, which China Mobile helped develop. 3G service is available in all of the 4 direct-controlled municipalities and most of the 283 prefecture-level cities in China .

;4G:
Marketed as &quot;and和&quot;, as of 2010, China Mobile has debuted small-scale 4G demonstration networks using a variant of 3GPP&#x27;s Long Term Evolution, TD-LTE, and has plans for larger, citywide demonstration networks in the future. , such networks are in operation.

While prior iPhone models could not use the China Mobile network due to the chipset relying on WCDMA-based networks, talks to carry the then unreleased 4G iPhone (iPhone 5) began in mid-2012. The iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s were sold through China Mobile starting in January 2014.

;5G:
China Mobile is developing a 5G service. As part of this development, Huawei has been awarded 52 percent of 5G contracts in 2023 (estimated at 45,426 base stations).

;Everest:
In 2003 and again in 2007, China Mobile provided mobile services on Mount Everest.

;Spratly Isles coverage
In May 2011, China Mobile announced its network now includes the controversial Spratly Islands.

<text>The Oka Crisis (), also known as the Kanehsatà:ke Resistance (), or Mohawk Crisis, was a land dispute between a group of Mohawk people and the town of Oka, Quebec, Canada, over plans to build a golf course on land known as &quot;The Pines&quot; which included an indigenous burial ground. The crisis began on July 11, 1990, and lasted 78 days until September 26, with two fatalities. The dispute was the first well-publicized violent conflict between First Nations and provincial governments in the late 20th century.

==Historical background==
===Early settlement===

Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) people, mainly members of the Mohawk nation (Kanien’kehà:ka), first established themselves in the Montreal area before moving north to their homeland in the Hudson River valley. The several hundred people who migrated at the time went on to develop three distinct Mohawk communities in the region: Kahnawá:ke, Kanehsatà:ke and Ahkwesáhsne.

Around 1658, the Mohawk had displaced from the area the Wyandot people (or Hurons), with whom the Haudenosaunee (of which the Mohawk were a tribe) had long been in conflict. In the fall of 1666, hundreds of French soldiers, as well as Algonquin and Huron allies, attacked southward from Lake Champlain and devastated four Mohawk villages near Albany, then negotiated a peace between the Haudenosaunee and the French and their allies which lasted for the next 20 years. In 1673, the Jesuit mission at Saint-François-Xavier brought about forty Mohawks from the village of Kaghnuwage, on the Mohawk River, in present-day New York state. In 1680, the Jesuits were granted the seigneurie Sault-Saint-Louis, now named the village of Kahnawá:ke, with a current area of over 4000 hectares. Starting in the 1680s, there was a military conflict between the English allied to the Mohawks and the French allied with other indigenous tribes. In the early 1690s, the Mohawks were weakened through a prolonged and severe military effort by the French.

In 1676, the Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice (Sulpician Fathers), a Roman Catholic order, then based in Paris, France, founded Montreal Island&#x27;s first mission at the foot of Mount Royal to minister to the Iroquois / Mohawk, Algonquin and Huron neophytes and to distance them from French settlers in Ville Marie. In 1696, the Sulpicians moved 
the mission to one on the edge of the , near the rapids, in north end Montreal Island. In 1717, the was granted a concession (3.5 of frontage, 3 deep) named .

In 1721, the Sulpicians moved the mission to two villages on territory with the Algonquins and Nipissings being assigned the village to the east and the Mohawks being assigned the village to the west including territory known since the late 1880s as &quot;The Pines&quot; (formerly &quot;sand dunes behind the village ... part of the Common Lands on which the Mohawks pastured their cattle&quot;) and the adjacent indigenous cemetery. This meant the Indigenous inhabitants were forced to move once again. To cushion the blow, they were promised ownership of the land they would inhabit. The was expanded through two grants, one in 1733, consisting of small pie-shaped segment with 2 of frontage to the east of initial concession land, and, in 1735, a larger segment representing about 40% of the seigneurie&#x27;s total area. In all three grants the land was provided under the guarantee it would be used for the benefit of Indigenous residents.

===Land dispute===

Following the conquest of New France in 1760, the Act of Capitulation of Montreal guaranteed that all the &quot;Indians&quot; who had been allied to the French would be free to remain on the land they inhabited unless those lands were formally ceded to the Crown. This was restated by the Treaty of Paris and again in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. Hence, the Mohawk began advocating for the recognition of their land rights to British officials. Similar claims in Kahnawá:ke and Ahkwesáhsne were recognized, but the Kanehsatà:ke requests to be released from the rule of the Sulpicians and reporting of seminary officials to white settlers were ignored. When the Sulpicians aided the British in crushing the Patriot&#x27;s War of 1837–38, the seminary&#x27;s land title was confirmed. The Mohawk continued pursuing their right to the land, petitioning, and failing, to obtain the recognition of Lord Elgin&#x27;s recognition of their claims in 1851. Eight years later, the Province of Canada extended the official title of the disputed land to the Sulpicians.

In 1868, one year after Confederation, the chief of the Oka Mohawk people, Joseph Onasakenrat, wrote a letter to the seminary claiming that its grant had included about reserved for Mohawk use in trust of the seminary, and that the seminary had neglected this trust by granting themselves (the seminary) sole ownership rights. In 1869, Onasakenrat attacked the seminary with a small armed force after having given the missionaries eight days to hand over the land. Local authorities ended this stand-off with force. In 1936, the seminary sold the territory under protest by the local Mohawk community. At the time they still kept cattle on the common land. By 1956, the Mohawk were left to six remaining square kilometres from their original 165.

In 1959, the town approved the development of a private nine-hole golf course, the , on a portion of the disputed land. The project area bordered The Pines, as well as a Mohawk burial ground in use, at that time, for nearly a century. The Mohawk suit filed against the development did not succeed. Construction also began on a parking lot and golf greens adjacent to the Mohawk cemetery.

In 1977, the Kanehsatà:ke band filed an official land claim with the federal Office of Native Claims regarding the land. The claim was accepted for filing and funds were provided for additional research of the claim. In 1986 the claim was rejected on the basis that it failed to meet key legal criteria.

In March 1989, the announced plans to expand the golf course by an additional nine holes. As the Office of Native Claims had rejected the Mohawk claim on the land three years earlier, his office did not consult the Mohawk on the plans. No environmental or historic preservation review was undertaken. Protests by Mohawks and others, as well as concern from the Quebec Minister of the Environment, led to negotiations and a postponement of the project by the municipality in August pending a court ruling on the development&#x27;s legality.

===Lead-up to the crisis===

On June 30, 1990, the court found in favour of the developers, and the mayor of Oka, Jean Ouellette, announced that the remainder of the Pines would be cleared to expand the golf course to eighteen holes and to construct 60 condominiums. Not all residents of Oka approved of the plans, but opponents found the mayor&#x27;s office unwilling to discuss them.

On March 11, as a protest against the court decision to allow the golf course expansion to proceed, some members of the Mohawk community erected a barricade blocking access to the dirt side-road between Route 344 and &quot;The Pines&quot;. Protesters ignored a court injunction in late April ordering the dismantling of the barricade, as well as a second order issued on June 29. Mayor Ouellette demanded compliance with the court order, but the land defenders refused.

On July 5, the Quebec minister of Public Security, Sam Elkas, said, regarding the land defenders at the Pines, that &quot;they have until the 9th [of July], after that date it&#x27;s going down.&quot; The next day, the Quebec Human Rights Commission alerted John Ciaccia and Tom Siddon, respectively the provincial and federal native affairs ministers, of the rapidly increasing threat of conflict near Oka and the need to establish an independent committee to review the historical Mohawk land claim. Ciaccia wrote a letter of support for the Mohawk, saying that &quot;these people have seen their lands disappear without having been consulted or compensated, and that, in my opinion, is unfair and unjust, especially over a golf course.&quot; This did not sway the mayor.

==Crisis==
===Police raid===

On July 11, at 5:15 a.m., police officers arrived to the Mohawk barricade that was blocking the Pines&#x27; southern gate. Police cars, vans, and rented trucks were parked in front of the roadblock. Police personnel took up tactical positions in the trees or crouched in ditches. Others proceeded to the barricade. At the same time, another police unit known as &quot;Sector Five&quot; approached the northern roadblock. A total of around a hundred officers surrounded the Mohawk warriors and their allies, including a tactical intervention squad and riot police.

The previous day the mayor of Oka, Jean Ouellette, had asked the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) to intervene with the Mohawk protest, citing alleged criminal activity at the barricade. While the protesters had expected town officials or municipal workers, they had been promised by an SQ officer that the police would not intervene in this civil injunction. While they were reportedly willing to be arrested in the defence of their land, they had hoped to avoid violence.

The Mohawk women present at the southern barricade purportedly took charge of the interactions with authorities as they recognized the protection of the land as their own duty. A dozen of them, arms stretched out to signify their being unarmed and having no violent intent, walked towards the police. Authorities said they would speak only to a designated leader, while the group of women said that they were all representing the interests of the group and no single leader existed. Tensions escalated as the authorities would not discuss matters with the Mohawk women. Eventually, the group compromised and asked a male protester to come forward and talk with the officers; which was in vain. The SQ deployed their Emergency Response Team (ERT), a police tactical unit, threw tear gas canisters and concussion grenades at the protesters in an attempt to force them to disperse.

The Kahnawá:ke Warrior Society was called in for reinforcements, and by 6:20 a.m. they were seizing Mercier Bridge and the highways which fed into it. They gained control of the two lanes of Highway 138, and then pushed back the thousands of cars to Châteauguay. Over the next three hours they created a no-man&#x27;s land between two barricades while other contingents blocked Highways 132 and 207 as well as Old Châteauguay Road.

Around 7:30 a.m. a front-end loader (sometimes cited as a bulldozer) and helicopter arrived, and the police moved closer to the barricade. Trees were sawed down by the Mohawk and added to the barricade while additional police cars arrived. Members of the surrounding Mohawk communities joined those already present at the Pines as tear gas canisters were thrown at the southern barrier. Around 8:30 the front-end loader rammed the barricade. Then armed police officers moved into the Pines, and gunshots were fired from both sides. Then the police retreated, abandoning six cruisers and the front-end loader. Although an initial account reported that 31-year-old SQ Corporal Marcel Lemay had been shot in the face during the firefight, a later inquest determined that the bullet which killed him struck his &quot;left side below the armpit, an area not covered by [his] bullet-proof vest&quot;. Despite a 1985 SQ directive mandating that all officer communications be recorded, no record of the events was provided to the court, which the coroner decried as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and &quot;even comical&quot;.

===Siege===

Upon their return, SQ officers established a perimeter around the protesters both at Kahnawáːke and Kanehsatàːke, blocking all access routes with rows of police cars and sandbags, preventing supplies like food and medication to be delivered and blocking ambulances from intervening. Representatives from the Quebec Human Rights Commission were also prevented from entering. In turn, protesters fortified their barricades and erected new ones, but police forced their way in to arrest, search and interrogate. On July 12, at the request of the Quebec minister of Public Security, the Canadian Armed Forces began sending plain clothes military officers, C7 rifles, night-vision equipment, bulletproof vests and armoured vehicles.

Before the raid, there were approximately 30 armed Mohawk in and around the barricade; following the gun battle, this number grew to 60–70 and later grew to 600. The Mohawks seized six vehicles, including four police cars, and commandeered the front-end loader to crush the vehicles and use them to form a new barricade across Route 344.


The Mohawk established a network for communications among the Mohawk villages/reserves of Ahkwesáhsne, Kanehsatàːke and Kahnawáːke, using hand-held radios, cellular phones, air raid sirens and fire hall bells, as well as local radio stations, and patrols. The local Mohawk were joined by Indigenous people from across Canada and the United States. People from Micmac communities, as well as a Buddhist monk and Filipina acupuncturist, joined the protesters in the early weeks of the fight. Fifteen activist-students were sent from all over Canada by the Canadian Federation of Students to write a policy paper, but most of the students decided to stay on in aid to the Mohawk cause instead. Additionally, over a hundred Oneida people from New York, Wisconsin, and southern Ontario, as well as a Quebec Algonquin man, and several women from western Canada and Mexico all came to help. The Mohawk Warriors and protesters also received support from Indigenous populations across the country.

The Mercier Bridge was blockaded at the point where it passed through Mohawk territory, thereby sealing off a major access between the Island of Montreal and Montreal&#x27;s densely populated South Shore suburbs. This frustrated commuters, which resulted in violent confrontations. At the peak of the crisis, the Mercier Bridge and routes 132, 138 and 207 were all blocked, creating substantial disruption to traffic.

Corporal Marcel Lemay&#x27;s funeral was held on July 16, and was attended by around 2000 people, including police officers from across Canada and the SQ director. The Warrior flag was lowered to half-mast in the Pines. On July 17, the Red Cross was granted entrance by police to provide food relief, but this access was rescinded quickly, forcing residents to smuggle provisions in. The Mohawk coalition, speaking on behalf of the resistance, agreed on preconditions for negotiations: free access to food and advisors and the presence of independent international observers, which both the provincial and federal governments firmly opposed.

Anger grew among residents as the crisis dragged on. A group of Châteauguay residents started building an unauthorized, unplanned roadway circumventing the Kahnawáːke reserve. Long after the crisis, this unfinished roadway was eventually incorporated into Quebec Autoroute 30. Residents of Châteauguay assaulted a Mohawk woman trying to buy groceries and tried to prevent her from leaving the store, from which she had to be escorted by police, and threw tomatoes at her and her children. They also burned multiple effigies of Mohawk warriors while chanting &quot;&quot; (savages).

By August 12, the crowd at Mercier Bridge had become a riot several thousand strong, destroying police vehicles and wounding officers. The SQ lost control of the situation, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) were deployed. This resulted in 35 people, including ten constables, being hospitalized for their injuries. The heated context of the &quot;failed&quot; Meech Lake Accord earlier that summer, as well as the tensions between French and English speakers in the province complicated public sentiment vis-a-vis the Kanehsatàːke resistance. Radio host Gilles Proulx raised tensions with comments such as the Mohawks &quot;couldn&#x27;t even speak French&quot;, while Simon Bédard of CJPR called for &quot;cleaning everything up&quot; by killing &quot;fifty, one hundred, one hundred and twenty-five&quot; people, burying them and forgetting about it. These remarks inflamed tempers that had been running especially high from comments preceding this crisis, including those by Ricardo Lopez, the federal Member of Parliament for Châteauguay, who denigrated the Mohawk.

===Intervention by the armed forces===

Nightly gatherings at the blockaded Mercier Bridge grew in size and violence, adding to the pressure put on SQ forces, leading the Quebec premier Robert Bourassa to announce that in accord with Section 275 of the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, he was requisitioning military support from the Canadian Armed Forces on August 27. The same day Mulroney appointed Quebec Chief Justice Alan B. Gold as special mediator to negotiate an agreement with the land defenders. On August 28, press conferences were held by military leadership to announce the upcoming intervention and by Mulroney to denounce the actions of the protesters. Lieutenant-General Kent Foster announced the upcoming use of three Leopard tanks and that Brigadier-General Armand Roy was given full autonomy to attack at will with the objective of obtaining &quot;unconditional surrender&quot; from the Warriors.

In response, families with children and elderly members attempt to flee Kahnawáːke, and were met at the barricades by a crowd throwing stones. Though the SQ had guaranteed safety for the evacuees, they did not attempt to stop the crowd from breaking windshields and windows. Several people were wounded. The car in which Mohawk elder Joe Armstrong, 71, was riding was hit with a projectile that shattered the windshield; the next day, Armstrong suffered a fatal heart attack that doctors attributed to stress. The following morning, Canadian Armed Forces replaced SQ officers surrounding Kahnawáːke and Kanehsatàːke.

General John de Chastelain, Chief of the Defence Staff, placed Quebec-based troops in support of the provincial authorities; 2,500 regular and reserve troops were put on notice. On August 20, a company of the Royal 22e Régiment, known colloquially in English as the &quot;Van Doos&quot;, led by Major Alain Tremblay, took over three barricades and arrived at the final blockade leading to the disputed area. There, they reduced the stretch of no man&#x27;s land, originally implemented by the SQ before the barricade at the Pines, from 1.5 kilometres to 5 metres. Additional troops and mechanized equipment mobilized at staging areas around Montreal, while reconnaissance aircraft flew air photo missions over Mohawk territory to gather intelligence. On August 29, the Mohawks at the Mercier Bridge negotiated an end to their protest blockade with Lieutenant-Colonel Robin Gagnon, the &quot;Van Doos&quot; commander who had been responsible for the south shore of the St. Lawrence River during the crisis.

While the Warriors at Kahnawáːke had reached an agreement with government officials and had begun dismantling their barricades, Kanehsatàːke was now more vulnerable and isolated. Though the land dispute which had led to the crisis was resolved in principle, since the federal government had secured the purchase of the land from the developers and the town of Oka, it had yet to transfer the land title into Mohawk hands. Furthermore, the protesters at Kanehsatàːke were still waiting on safety guarantees for themselves and their allies before risking giving up their last bargaining chips. Nonetheless, Bourassa announced that negotiations were over and demanded that international observers leave. They reluctantly submitted to his request, and were replaced by local church and human rights observers. Multiple parallel and sometimes secret talks were held, unbeknownst to many of the parties involved. With the bridge no longer occupied and Kahnawáːke essentially neutralized, the armed forces entered Kanehsatàːke on September 1. They dismantled the last barricade on Highway 344 on September 2. The next day, only 24 Warriors were left defending a territory of only a few hundred meters and were surrounded by ravines, the lake, over 400 soldiers with machine guns, armoured vehicles and helicopters. They were sheltered in a treatment centre, at the top of a hill, with dormitories, a kitchen, food reserves, and communication equipment. What followed was the last leg of a prolonged siege.

By September 6, the Mercier Bridge was functional again. Journalists were forbidden from approaching the Warrior stronghold and the armed forces cut all cellphone service to the treatment centre. Anyone who left the compound was arrested, including legal counsel Stanley Cohen.

==Resolution and aftermath==
September 25, 1990 witnessed the final engagement of the crisis: a Mohawk warrior walked around the perimeter of the blockade area with a long stick, setting off flares that had been originally installed by the Canadian Forces to alert them to individuals fleeing the area. The soldiers turned a water hose on this man, but it lacked enough pressure to disperse the crowd surrounding him. This crowd taunted the soldiers and began throwing water balloons at them, but the incident did not escalate further.

Finally, after 78 days of fighting and 26 days of siege without supplies being let through, the land defenders decided to end the struggle. The remaining protesters began walking home, but all were arrested either while leaving Kanehsatà:ke or while entering Oka. As the military began arresting land defenders and some began to flee, 14-year-old Waneek Horn-Miller, who was carrying her 4-year-old half sister Kaniehtiio Horn, was stabbed near the heart by a Canadian soldier with a bayonet, and nearly died. The journalists who had managed to stay with the Mohawk people in the treatment center were now held and interrogated. The Kanehsatà:ke Resistance was over.

Among those charged and convicted for their participation was Ronaldo Casalpro (who used the alias Ronald &quot;Lasagna&quot; Cross during the conflict). Casalpro was beaten by Sûreté du Québec officers after his arrest, and while three were suspended without pay, the case took so long to process that they had already left the force. Two SQ officers were suspended and investigated for allegedly beating Casalpro while in captivity, but were not subsequently charged. Cross served a six-year sentence for assault and weapons charges related to his role in the crisis and died of a heart attack in November 1999. Casalpro&#x27;s brother, Tracy Cross, later served as the best man at the wedding of slain SQ Corporal Lemay&#x27;s sister, Francine, who had reconciled with the community after reading &quot;At the Woods&#x27; Edge&quot;, a history of Kanehsatà:ke.

The golf course expansion that had originally triggered the crisis was cancelled and the land under dispute was purchased from the developers by the Government of Canada for million. The municipality initially refused to sell the land until Mohawk barricades were dismantled, but acquiesced when the government threatened to expropriate the land without compensation. The Government of Canada did not transfer this land to Kanehsatà:ke ownership nor establish it as a land reserve.

The Oka Crisis motivated the development of a national First Nations Policing Policy to try to prevent future incidents, and brought Indigenous issues into the forefront in Canada. In 1991, Ouellette was re-elected mayor of Oka by acclamation. He later said of the crisis that his responsibilities as mayor required him to act as he did.

==In media==
The Oka Crisis was extensively documented and inspired numerous books and films.

Canadian filmmaker Alanis Obomsawin has made documentaries about the Oka Crisis, including &quot;&quot; (1993) and &quot;Rocks at Whiskey Trench&quot; (2000). These and two additional documentaries on the crisis were all produced by the National Film Board of Canada: Christine Welsh directed &quot;Keepers of the Fire&quot; (1994), which documents the role of Mohawk women during the crisis, and Alec MacLeod created &quot;Acts of Defiance&quot; (1993).

&quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; journalist Albert Nerenberg switched careers after smuggling a video camera behind the barricades and making his first documentary, called &quot;Okanada&quot;.

Taiaiake Alfred, a Kahnawá:ke Mohawk who was part of the band council during the crisis, and who later became a professor of political science, wrote &quot;Heeding the Voices of Our Ancestors: Kahnawake Mohawk Politics and the Rise of Native Nationalism&quot; (1995). This was based on his PhD dissertation of the same name, which examined the issues.

Robin Philpot wrote a book about Canadian English language media&#x27;s use of the crisis as a political tool following the failed Meech Lake Accord: .

The 2020 film &quot;Beans&quot;, which won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Motion Picture, portrays the incident through the eyes of a young Mohawk girl. Tracey Deer, who lived through the crisis when she was twelve years old, directed and co-wrote the film.

==In art==

Joseph Tehawehron David, a Mohawk artist who became known for his role as a warrior during the Oka Crisis in 1990, developed a body of artistic work that was deeply influenced by his experience &quot;behind the wire&quot; in 1990.

<doc id="375493" wikidata="Q17015812" url="?curid=375493" title="Worshipful Company of Gardeners">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Gardeners is one of the livery companies of the City of London. A fraternity of Gardeners existed in the middle of the fourteenth century; it received a royal charter in 1605. The company no longer exists as a regulatory authority for the sale of produce in London; instead serving as a charitable institution. The company also performs a ceremonial role; it formally presents bouquets to the Queen and to princesses upon their wedding, anniversary, or other similar occasion.

The Gardeners&#x27; Company ranks sixty-sixth in the order of precedence of City livery companies. Its motto is &quot;In The Sweat Of Thy Brows Shalt Thow Eate Thy Bread&quot;.

The Master Gardener (Nicholas Woolf for 2023/24) is assisted by the Upper Warden and Renter Warden. Other Gardeners&#x27; Company officers include the Clerk and Spadebearer.

==Origins==
First mentioned in Corporation of London records in 1345, the Gardeners&#x27; Company hails from its predecessor medieval guild.

In 1605, after existing for centuries as a &quot;mystery&quot; or &quot;fellowship&quot;, the Gardeners of London were incorporated by royal charter. This charter sets out the operations controlled by the Company: &quot;The trade, crafte or misterie of gardening, planting, grafting, setting, sowing, cutting, arboring, rocking, mounting, covering, fencing and removing of plants, herbes, seedes, fruites, trees, stocks, setts, and of contryving the conveyances to the same belonging ... &quot;.

===Objectives===
In the 21st century statutory control over the craft of gardening is neither feasible nor desirable. Instead, the Company pursues three main objectives, to:

# promote the art and practice of good gardening throughout the country and especially in the London area. Further, to encourage and support educational establishments which are centres of horticultural excellence;
# support charitable activities connected with horticulture or with the City of London. The Company does not benefit from large endowments and has never owned property. The Charitable Fund is therefore limited and largely dependent upon the generosity of its Liverymen and Freemen (i.e. members of the Company) who are expected to contribute to the Fund as a condition of membership;
# promote the fellowship of gardening by introducing new members to the Company and to beautify the City of London and elsewhere by encouraging the display of flowers and foliage wherever and whenever possible. There is a wide knowledge of gardening and horticulture within the Company which can be drawn upon as practical support for new projects.

==Organisation and structure==

Membership of the Company, as prescribed by the Court of Aldermen of the City of London, shall not exceed 330 Liverymen. The number of Freemen is unlimited.

The Company is administered by the Court of Assistants, comprising the Master, who acts as Chairman supported by the Upper Warden and Renter Warden, and 24 Assistants. Of these, not more than 6 are Past Masters and 18 are &quot;below the Chair&quot;. The Master holds office for one year and is normally succeeded by the Upper Warden. The Clerk to the Company is the Chief Executive and has responsibility for day-to-day administration of the Company and acts as secretary to the Court.

Six committees, comprising Assistants and Liverymen, address specific matters relating to the Company&#x27;s activities and make recommendations to the Court. The opportunity of participating in the running of the Company is thereby provided to Liverymen.

==The livery and freedom==

The Company numbers among its members both professionals and amateurs who are actively involved in the craft. All are united by the common bond of gardens and gardening.

King Charles III is a Royal Liveryman as is the Duke of Edinburgh, who served as Master for 2013/14 when Earl of Wessex. The King and Queen of the Belgians are Royal Freemen of the Company, reflecting the British gardening&#x27;s strong links with Belgium.

As a City Livery Company, there are close links with the Corporation of London and members of the Company are strongly represented on the Court of Common Council. Since 1891, the year in which the Company was granted livery status, 11 Lord Mayors of London have been Gardeners, of which, eight have served as Master.

Admission to the Company is usually by one of four routes: Patrimony, Servitude, Redemption or Presentation. Candidates for admission to the Freedom and advancement to the Livery are subject to interview and recommendation by a committee appointed by the Court. A fifth category of membership is that of Honorary Freedom (Freedom Honoris Causa) which the Court has the power to award to persons who have distinguished themselves by public service or individual merit.

==The Company&#x27;s year==

Installation Court, at which the Master and Wardens are installed, takes place on the first Thursday in July. It marks the beginning of the Company&#x27;s year and is followed by a livery dinner. Court meetings followed by dinner take place in November (Autumn Court) and April (Spring Court), with a Harvest Court preceding the Harvest Thanksgiving service in October. Guests are invited to all livery dinners and guild services.

The Fairchild Lecture, delivered in accordance with the will of Thomas Fairchild, Citizen and Gardener, takes place on the first Tuesday in Pentecost at St. Giles, Cripplegate. Churches for the Guild services are decorated by the Flower Arrangers group within the Company, who also arrange flowers in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and on other Company occasions.

Its annual Livery and Ladies&#x27; Banquet is held at the Mansion House, in the presence of the Lord Mayor, at which the Master presents a donation for the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Charity.

Visits, led by the Master, take place throughout the year to gardens and horticultural establishments at home and abroad and the Company pursues a busy programme of events.

The Gardeners&#x27; Company produces a magazine called &quot;The Spade&quot;, giving details of recent events and visits. 

==Charitable activities==

The Company makes donations through its independent Charity Board to registered charities only. The charities must be linked to horticulture and gardening. Individuals and groups in the horticultural industry who have fallen on hard times should consider applying to Perennial. The Company provides funds and advice for charitable garden projects and awards prizes to students of horticulture at Capel Manor College, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, RHS Wisley, Writtle College and the City and Guilds of London Institute. The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Trophy is presented annually to the student adjudged to have contributed most to the field of organic gardening. Trophies are also awarded to other deserving organisations and causes.

The Company organises the &quot;Flowers in The City&quot; Campaign in close co-operation with the Corporation of London. The aim is to encourage the planting of gardens, courtyards, atria, window boxes, troughs, tubs and hanging baskets to beautify the City. The award, by the Lord Mayor, of trophies and plaques for meritorious displays (Summer) takes place annually at Mansion House. The award for winter displays takes place annually at Cutlers&#x27; Hall.

The Master, whilst in office, represents the Company on a variety of charitable committees. Other members of the Company sit on those committees in their own right and also contribute their time and expertise to numerous other organisations for the furtherance of the craft and in pursuit of the Company&#x27;s objectives.
The Company is privileged to present a gift of produce each year to the Lord Mayor.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Tin Plate Workers &quot;alias&quot; Wire Workers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. Tin craftsmen were originally part of the Ironmongers&#x27; Company, while the wire workers, who made wire objects such as cages, animal traps and fishhooks, were part of the Girdlers&#x27; Company. The two groups combined, and were incorporated by a Royal Charter in 1670. Now, the use of tin plate and steel wire does not remain work done by craftsmen, instead being performed by machines. Thus, the Company is no longer a trade association for craftsmen. Instead, it supports the industry through grants, as it does charities.

The Tin Plate Workers&#x27; Company ranks sixty-seventh in the order of precedence for Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Amore Sitis Uniti&quot;, Latin for &quot;Be United in Love&quot;.

<text>The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) is the provincial police service of Ontario, Canada. The OPP patrols provincial highways and waterways; protects provincial government buildings and officials, with the exception of the legislative precinct; patrols unincorporated areas in northern Ontario; provides training, operational support, and funding to some Indigenous police forces; and investigates complex or multi-jurisdictional crimes across the province. The OPP also has a number of local mandates through contracts with municipal governments and First Nations, where it acts as the local police force and provides front-line services.

With an annual budget of nearly $1.4 billion, the OPP employed more than 6,100 uniformed officers, 500 auxiliary officers, and 2,800 civilian employees in 2023, making it the largest police service in Ontario and the second-largest in Canada (after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police). The OPP&#x27;s operations are directed by its commissioner (Thomas Carrique) and it is a division of the Ministry of the Solicitor General.

== History ==
At the First Parliament of Upper Canada in Niagara-on-the-Lake on 17 September 1792, a provision was made for the formation of a &quot;police system&quot;. Initially, policing jurisdictions were limited to districts, townships, and parishes. In 1845, a mounted police service was created to keep the peace in areas surrounding the construction of public works. It became the Ontario Mounted Police Force after Canadian Confederation.

In 1877, the &quot;Constables Act&quot; extended jurisdiction and gave designated police members authorization to act throughout the province. The first salaried provincial constable appointed to act as detective for the government of Ontario was John Wilson Murray, hired on a temporary appointment in 1875 and made permanent upon passage of the 1877 act. Murray was joined by two additional detectives in 1897, marking the beginnings of the Criminal Investigation Branch. However, for the most part, policing outside of Ontario&#x27;s cities was non-existent.
With the discovery of silver in Cobalt and gold in Timmins, lawlessness was increasingly becoming a problem in northern Ontario. Police constables were gradually introduced in various areas, until an Order in Council decreed the establishment of a permanent organization of salaried constables designated as the Ontario Provincial Police Force on 13 October 1909. It consisted of 45 men under the direction of Superintendent Joseph E. Rogers. The starting salary for constables was $400 per annum, increased to $900 in 1912. There were many detachments simultaneously founded including Bala, Muskoka, and Niagara Falls.

In the 1920s, restructuring was undertaken with the passing of the &quot;Provincial Police Force Act, 1921&quot;. The title of the commanding officer was changed to &quot;commissioner&quot; and given responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot; and other liquor regulations. Major-General Harry Macintyre Cawthra-Elliot was appointed as the first commissioner.

The OPP&#x27;s first death in the line of duty occurred in 1923, when escaped convict Leo Rogers shot and killed Sergeant John Urquhart near North Bay. Rogers, who was later killed in a shootout with OPP officers, had already mortally wounded North Bay City constable, Fred Lefebvre.

The first OPP motorcycle patrol was introduced in 1928, phased out in 1942, and then reintroduced in 1949. The first marked OPP patrol car was introduced in 1941.

During World War II, the Veterans Guard was formed. This was a body of volunteers (primarily World War I veterans) whose duty was to protect vulnerable hydroelectric plants and the Welland Ship Canal under the supervision of regular police members.

In the late 1940s, policing functions were reorganized in Ontario, with the OPP given responsibility for all law enforcement in the province outside areas covered by municipal police forces, together with overall authority for law enforcement on the King&#x27;s Highways, enforcement of the provincial liquor laws, aiding the local police, and maintaining a criminal investigation branch. In March 1969, a meeting took place at the Ontario Securities Commission to incorporate a separate but included group of the Ontario Provincial Police Association. Women joined the uniformed ranks in 1974. Between 1983 and 1993, the OPP officer Al Robinson served as the police hander for the informer Marvin Elkind in what has been described as the most successful undercover operation ever ran by the OPP.
In 1994, as part of a tripartite agreement between the government of Canada, the province of Ontario, and the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, the OPP began the process of relinquishing a majority of northern policing duties to the newly created Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service (NAPS). The transition was complete on 1 April 1999, when the OPP&#x27;s Northwest Patrol was transferred to NAPS. The OPP still administers First Nations policing for Big Trout Lake, Weagamow, Muskrat Dam, and Pikangikum.

==Organization and operations==

The OPP provides police services to the provincial government - patrolling provincial highways and waterways, investigating multijurisdictional crimes, and protecting high-profile government officials - under provincial mandate, and to municipalities and First Nations under contract.

The force operates out of its General Headquarters, located in the Lincoln M. Alexander Building in Orillia, Ontario. The relocation of general headquarters to Orillia was part of a government move to decentralize ministries and operations to other parts of Ontario. Previously, from 1973 to 1995, the headquarters were located in Toronto at 90 Harbour Street, the site of the former Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Board building.

The force is organized into five commands, each answering to a deputy commissioner. The commands are further divided into bureaus. The Culture and Strategy Services Command is responsible for corporate communications, strategic development, and the force&#x27;s internal misconduct investigations unit; the Traffic Safety and Operational Support Command is responsible for highway policing, Indigenous policing, support services like the Tactics and Rescue Unit, and security at provincial government buildings excepting the Ontario Legislative Building; the Field Operations Command is responsible for frontline policing in communities that do not maintain independent police forces; the Investigations and Organized Crime Command is responsible for investigating complex, major, or multi-jurisdictional crimes or organized criminal networks across the province and administering firearms licenses; and the Corporate Services Command administers various business, contract, and career management bureaus.

=== Local and provincial programs and services ===
Source: 
=== Detachments ===
Previously, the OPP was divided into seventeen different regions. In 1995, OPP operations were amalgamated into six regions, with five providing general policing services, and one providing traffic policing services on provincial highways in the Greater Toronto Area (local police services in the GTA are provided by municipal and regional police forces) following recommendations by the Ipperwash Inquiry. OPP police stations are known as &quot;detachments&quot;.

=== Rank structure ===

Police constables in the OPP are uniquely known as &quot;provincial constables&quot;.

Detective ranks fall laterally with the uniform ranks and are not a promotion above. The rank of sergeant major is reserved for members of the Professional Standards Bureau, where the rank has a unique investigative function within the force&#x27;s chain-of-command.

==== Sworn rank insignia ====
==== Civilian rank insignia ====
=== Commissioner&#x27;s Own Pipes and Drums ===
The Commissioner&#x27;s Own Pipes and Drums serves as the OPP&#x27;s officially recognised pipe band. Formed as the Ontario Provincial Pipes and Drums in 1968 by two constables, the band saw active service to wide acclaim in the 1970s and 80s before being disbanded in 1991 due to department financial constraints. The band was shortly re-formed three years after, and is now composed of volunteer officers, auxiliary officers, and civilian volunteers.

===Uniformed officers===

The majority of policing services are provided by uniformed front-line police constables. In addition to the basic training provided to all police officers in Ontario, the OPP mandates additional training at the Provincial Police Academy before and after attendance at the Ontario Police College, resulting in the longest training period among Ontario police services. After this, probationary police constables are assigned to a detachment within the OPP&#x27;s six regions with a coach officer for a year of field training. At the end of probation, a decision is made regarding retention. First Nations constables employed by OPP-supported police services undergo the same training as OPP officers, spending time at the Provincial Police Academy as well as at the Ontario Police College before returning to their home communities.

===Auxiliary program===
Auxiliary members have no police authority. They must rely on the same arrest provisions as regular citizens. There are some instances when an auxiliary member may have the authority of a police officer. This can occur in an emergency situation, or where the OPP requires additional strength to assist with a special event. Auxiliary officers are unpaid, however are compensated for travel and meals. They are required to attend routine training administered by the OPP, and must contribute a certain number of hours monthly. The auxiliary is made up of people from diverse backgrounds.

Auxiliary members are trained at the Provincial Police Academy and qualified with all use of force options.

The auxiliary uniform is distinct from the uniform of a regular OPP officer. Auxiliary officers wear light blue shirts, checkered hat bands, and have their own cap badges. They wear slip-ons with the word &quot;auxiliary&quot; embroidered on them, and their jackets and dress uniforms have tabs sewn on that indicates that they are auxiliary officers.

==== History ====
Following the disbanding of World War II auxiliary forces, growing Cold War tension and fear of a nuclear attack led to the belief that police services should &quot;recruit and train volunteers to augment their strength in times of emergency&quot;. As a result, in 1954, the Provincial Civil Defence Auxiliary was created, but the need to more closely associate the auxiliary with the OPP soon became apparent.

On 14 January 1960, the Provincial Civil Defence Organization was dissolved. A new oversight body known as the Emergency Measures Organization—Ontario (EMO) came into being. Each department of the government became responsible for its own operational planning. The organization of auxiliary police forces became the responsibility of all interested municipal police forces, as well as the OPP.

In April 1960, a new organization more closely affiliated with the OPP came into being. The Ontario Auxiliary Police were organized in 12 of the 17 OPP districts and by the end of the year, 376 volunteers had signed up to be equipped and trained by experienced OPP personnel. Two OPP inspectors were assigned to work with Emergency Measures Ontario as liaison officers for the volunteers. This close connection continues today with the OPP auxiliary playing a critical role in emergency and disaster planning and occurrences. By 1961 there were 466 auxiliary volunteers who accompanied regular provincials on traffic and law enforcement patrols and during the year logged more than twenty-six thousand hours of volunteer duty.

== Equipment ==
=== Uniforms ===
Uniformed officers below the rank of staff sergeant wear navy blue uniforms with gold lettering and shoulder flashes. Sworn managers at or above the rank of staff sergeant wear slightly smaller, black shoulder flashes and white shirts, and wear navy trousers with black piping. Officers below the rank of staff sergeant use trousers with light blue trouser piping, and forage caps for all ranks are banded with the same light blue colour. As of 2021, officers may also choose to wear a baseball cap instead of the traditional forage cap. Officers wear duty belts, which, at a minimum, carry an officer&#x27;s issued use of force equipment, and also wear an external Pacific Safety Products vest with MOLLE webbing to store additional items and large placards that read &quot;police&quot; in gold text on their chest and back.

During the 2022-23 fiscal year, the OPP engaged in a proof-of-concept program in East Region which included the use of body worn cameras (BWC), along with its accompanying mobile applications.

Officers serving with specialty tactical units are also issued cargo pants without piping, utility tops, and subdued placards for their external tactical vests. Officers serving with the Tactics and Rescue Unit are issued olive green uniforms.

Since 1985, wide, light blue stripes down the side of issued trousers have been standard. Prior to this, officers wore pants with thin, red trouser piping. From 1997 to 2008, the official headdress of the OPP was the stetson, though commissioned ranks were still issued the forage cap. Starting in 2008, the OPP returned to the peaked cap for all officers.

=== Fleet ===

* 5,269 road vehicles (patrol, investigative, multi-use, motorcycle, trailers and specialty)
* 1,054 seasonal vehicles (Marine vessels, motorized snow (MSV) and off-road vehicles (ORV))

====Ground====

The OPP has approximately 5,200 cruisers in service across the province according to the 2023 Annual Report. Officers mainly patrol using all-wheel drive versions of the Ford Taurus Police Interceptor, Ford Explorer Police Utility, Ford F-150 Police Responder, Dodge Charger Pursuit, Dodge Durango Special Service Package, Chevrolet Silverado, Chevrolet Tahoe, and Dodge Ram 2500 Power Wagon for frontline patrol. For specialized roles, a variety of vehicles are used, such as the Chevrolet Suburban, Ford F250 Super Duty, and the Cambli International Thunder 1 armoured rescue vehicles used by the Tactics and Rescue Unit, as well as an International-based truck used by the Highway Safety Division and Mobile Support Units. Previously, models of the Ford Crown Victoria and Chevrolet Impala were used.

During the 2022-23 fiscal year, the OPP engaged in a proof-of-concept program in East Region which included the deployment and implementation of In-Car Camera Systems which includes an integrated Automatic Licence Plate Recognition (ALPR) technology. In March 2023, the OPP completed a provincial implementation of In-Car Camera systems with integrated ALPR into over 1,300 frontline vehicles across all regions of the province.

Historically, from 1941 to 1989, the OPP livery was black and white. In 1989, in response to manufacturers no longer offering dual tone vehicles, the OPP switched to an all-white livery with blue and gold striping. Vehicles of this era were equipped with Federal Signal&#x27;s Vector light bars with integrated traffic advisers. In 2007, the OPP announced that it would return to a black and white colour scheme. The colour scheme is accomplished with the use of vinyl wraps during in-house vehicle outfitting. The change was implemented starting in March 2007 and was completed in 2009. Vehicles of this era had detachment markings on the rear quarter panel and used Federal Signal Arjent S2 light bars. Current vehicles have eschewed the detachment markings and are equipped with Whelen Legacy light bars. Unmarked vehicles are generally white, black, grey or dark blue. All marked cruisers are equipped with pushbars, also generally have black steel rims, and spotlights mounted on the driver side. Licence plates on the cruisers are generally the standard Ontario licence plates with a special validation sticker denoting permanent registration.

====Aviation====
As of February 2023, the OPP has the following aircraft listed with Transport Canada as the Province Of Ontario, Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services, and operate as Nav Canada airline designator GD, and telephony GUARDIAN.
* 2 Eurocopter EC135 P2+
* 2 Pilatus PC12NG - personnel and prisoner transport, First Nations policing support

* 1 DJI Mavic 2 Pro
* 6 DJI Mavic Air
* 4 DJI M30T
* 3 DJI M300
* 4 DJI Mavic 3T
* 4 Autel Evo II Pro

====Marine====
* Kanter Marine &quot;Chris D. Lewis&quot; 38-foot police boat
* Boston Whaler 24-foot police boat
=== Weapons ===
Ontario Provincial Police officers carry a variety of use of force equipment in the performance of their duties. The current sidearm of the OPP is the Glock 17M pistol in 9x19mm. Previously, officers were issued either the Sig Sauer P229 DAO, or the P229R DAK in .40S&amp;W. Patrol vehicles are also equipped with the Colt Canada C8 patrol rifle in 5.56x45mm NATO, with the option of the Remington 870 in 12 gauge. All uniformed officers carry TASER X2 conducted energy weapons 

The Tactics and Rescue Unit have more specialized weapons at their disposal including:

* Accuracy International AW
* Armalite AR10
* Colt Canada C8 patrol CQB carbine
* Knights Armament SR25
* Heckler &amp; Koch MP5
==Controversies==
===Caledonia land dispute===

The Caledonia land dispute began in 2006 when members of the Six Nations of the Grand River began an occupation of land that they believed belonged to them, to bring light to their land claims, and to the plight of aboriginal land claims across Canada. The land at the centre of the dispute was owned by a corporation planning to build a subdivision known as the Douglas Creek Estates. The Ontario Provincial Police were called in to keep the peace. Tensions led to violence and over the span of several years, the Ontario Provincial Police were criticized for perceived inaction against the native protesters by local residents. In 2011, a class-action lawsuit against the government of Ontario was settled.

===Ipperwash Crisis===
The Ipperwash Provincial Park is a former provincial park in Lambton County, Ontario. On 4 September 1995, first nations people occupied the park to bring attention to decades-old land claims that had not been recognized, resulting in the Ipperwash Crisis. The park had been expropriated from the Stoney Point Ojibway during World War II. The protest increased in tensions, resulting in the shooting and subsequent death of a protester, Anthony O&#x27;Brien &quot;Dudley&quot; George, by Acting Sergeant Ken Deane of the Tactics and Rescue Unit. Deane was subsequently convicted of criminal negligence causing death. In 2003, an inquiry called the Ipperwash Inquiry, into the events at Ipperwash was convened, and concluded in 2007. The OPP now uses a variety of different methods in resolving conflicts at major events, most notably by the use of the Provincial Liaison Teams (PLT), formerly known as the Major Event Liaison Team (MELT)

===John Doe v. Ontario (Information and Privacy Commissioner)===

In 1993 an Ontario Divisional Court case, &quot;John Doe v. Ontario&quot; (Information and Privacy Commissioner), Judge Matlow of the Ontario Divisional Court, suspected that four officers of the Toronto Police Service engaged in a fabrication of evidence and harassment of an accused party. Judge Matlow under the Ontario &quot;Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act&quot; (FIPPA), sought access to the report of the Ontario Provincial Police exonerating the officers, but was denied access to it by the OPP. Access was later granted by the FIPPA commissioner, but a judicial review of the FIPPA commissioner&#x27;s order to release the report resulted in publication of the OPP report being banned.

===Ontario Provincial Police Association===

The OPPA was established in 1954 to represent sworn and civilian members of the OPP, as well as OPP retirees. In March 2015, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced they were investigating fraud allegations against three top executives of the OPPA.

===Appointment of Ron Taverner===
In 2018, Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, was nominated to replace outgoing Commissioner Vince Hawkes. The appointment of Taverner brought about controversy given the personal relationship between him and Premier Doug Ford, potential nepotism, and the OPP&#x27;s role in investigating political corruption. It was also discovered that the requirements of the position were changed to allow someone in rank equivalent to Taverner to apply. Ultimately, Taverner rescinded his interest in the position, resulting in the appointment York Regional Police Deputy Chief Thomas Carrique as the OPP&#x27;s new commissioner.

== In popular culture ==
The Beatles&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; contains cover art with Paul McCartney wearing an OPP patch on his fictional uniform (more easily seen in the gatefold picture). In January 2016 the origins of the patch was confirmed as a gift from an OPP corporal on 28 September 1964, at Malton Airport as the Beatles were on their way to Montreal.

On the online social networking website Habbo Hotel Canada, OPP officers and spokespersons visit the online application to talk to teens on board the web site&#x27;s &quot;Infobus&quot;. During the weekly sessions, users of the Habbo service are able to ask the officers and spokespersons questions, primarily regarding online safety.

===Film and television===
In the television series &quot;Cardinal&quot;, the OPP is fictionalized as the Ontario Police Department (OPD), with a shoulder patch similar to that of the actual OPP except that the top element is replaced by three stylized maple leaves on a branch. OPP cruisers in the series are marked similar to actual cruisers, however the Queen&#x27;s crown is replaced with a stylized beaver, and the vehicles are marked &quot;O.P.D.&quot; instead of &quot;O.P.P.&quot; In 2016, the Discovery Channel aired the reality TV series &quot;Heavy Rescue: 401&quot;, following members of the OPP and local heavy tow operators, profiling their efforts during events and routine operations on Highway 401, a highway that crosses southern Ontario.

In the Canadian horror film &quot;Pontypool&quot;, the OPP is called into the eponymous town to control a zombie outbreak, ultimately resulting in a massacre. The film&#x27;s lead character, Grant Mazzy, vocally denounces the OPP&#x27;s actions on the radio.

<doc id="375500" wikidata="Q2915034" url="?curid=375500" title="Sûreté du Québec">
<text>The  (SQ; , ) is the provincial police service for the Canadian province of Quebec. The agency&#x27;s name is sometimes translated to Quebec Provincial Police (QPP) and Quebec Police Force (QPF) in English-language sources. The headquarters of the are located on Parthenais Street in Montreal&#x27;s Sainte-Marie neighbourhood, and the service employs over 5,700 officers. The SQ is the second-largest provincial police service (behind the Ontario Provincial Police) and the third-largest police service in Canada (behind the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Ontario Provincial Police).

==Function==
The primary function of the Sûreté du Québec (SQ) is to enforce provincial laws, some municipal bylaws, the federal &quot;Criminal Code&quot; and many other laws throughout Quebec, and to assist municipal police services when needed.

At the local level, the SQ is responsible for providing local police services to municipalities that chose not to have their own police department (mostly localities with populations under 50,000), in exchange for payment relative to their size. In other cities, the Sûreté du Québec can also take over criminal investigations from municipal police services when required by the &quot;Police Act&quot; of the province, according to the severity of the crime and the size of the population (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the SQ will take in charge any homicide with no imminent arrests in a city of less than 250,000, even if it has its own police department). The SQ is usually present in smaller, rural or suburban communities, and it is not usually visible on the streets of large urban centres like Montreal and Quebec City, whose own police departments must provide a wide range of services and operations by law. In those cities, however, the SQ still has large offices where various investigations are conducted.

At the provincial level, the SQ is responsible for actions such as patrolling the highways of Quebec, preserving the integrity of governmental institutions, coordinating large-scale investigations (such as during the biker war in the 1990s), and maintaining and sharing the criminal intelligence database of Quebec with other services. In addition, the SQ can provide technical assistance to Quebec&#x27;s independent investigation unit (BEI) in any incident involving possible wrongdoing by another police department, such as deaths and serious injuries. Should the SQ be involved in such an incident, assistance (if needed) will be provided either by the police service of Montreal or of Quebec City.

==History==
On February 1, 1870, the Quebec provincial government created the &quot;Police provinciale du Québec&quot; under the direction of its first commissioner, Judge Pierre-Antoine Doucet. This new service took over the headquarters of the Quebec City municipal police, which were then disbanded, although the city relaunched a municipal service in 1877.

In 1900, two distinct provincial police services were created: the Office of Provincial Detectives of Montreal, in response to a crime wave in that city, and the Revenue Police, whose mission was to collect taxes. In 1902, the government decided that the provincial police should no longer be directed by a judge but by an officer of the police themselves. Augustin McCarthy was chosen as the first chief drawn from the ranks of the police.

In 1922, two headquarters were established, one in Quebec City, headed by McCarthy, and one in Montreal, headed by Dieudonné Daniel Lorrain. The Office of Provincial Detectives of Montreal became part of the general provincial police in that year. The Quebec division included 35 police officers and two detectives.
In 1925, police officers started patrolling on motorcycles. In 1929 and 1930, the structure of the service was reformed and the agency adopted a new name as &quot; Sûreté provinciale du Québec&quot; which was later shortened to its present name.

===Oka Crisis===

A significant local, provincial, national and First Nations crisis erupted in 1990 after SQ officers attempted to enforce a court order on the Mohawks of Oka, Quebec. SQ Corporal Marcel Lemay was killed by gunfire in the initial raid (likely by friendly fire ), and a 77-day standoff ensued.

===Montebello incident===

The Sûreté du Québec admitted in August 2007 that they had used undercover police posing as protestors at the 2007 Montebello Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America meetings. This admission was made after a video captured by protestors was widely circulated in the Canadian media and made available on YouTube. The video appeared to show one of the officers carrying a rock, suggesting that the police may have been acting as inciting agents by inciting violence.

==Rank badges==
Rank insignia of the Sûreté du Québec are contained on slip-on sleeves, worn on the epaulettes of uniform jacket or shirt shoulders.

Constables (Agent) do not have any insignia on their uniform. The SQ formerly had the rank of Corporal above Constable rank. Team leaders have an epaulette with the words &quot;Chef d&#x27;équipe&quot;.

==Uniforms==
Early uniforms were British in origin, including the use of the custodian helmet, with the kepi later added as well. The service adopted a uniform with a more distinct green tone, as well as a peaked cap, in the 1960s.

The emblem of the service changed in the 1970s, when the old provincial coat of arms gave way to the fleur-de-lis.

In late 2016, Martin Prud&#x27;Homme, Director General of the SQ, announced the uniforms would be changed. Shirts and coats will be of a darker shade of olive green; patches, caps, and bulletproof vests will become black, and pants blue-black. One of the justifications for the changes was that the old green uniform was too similar to that of a soldier&#x27;s.

==Fleet==
Beginning progressively in 2017, marked patrol cars are set to become black with white doors, on which the word &quot;POLICE&quot; will be more evident.

==Equipment==

The standard-issue weapon of the SQ is the Glock pistol, loaded in 9×19mm Parabellum caliber. Various models have been adopted, such as the standard Glock 17 Gen 3, compact Glock 19, and sub-compact Glock 26. Tactical officers used the C8CQB Close Quarter Battle combat rifle, a variant of the Colt Canada C8 rifle.

Prior to the Glock pistols, officers carried .357 Magnum revolvers, which were replaced with the Glock 17 in 2001.

===Licence Plate Recognition System===

The SQ has been using the LPRS systems since 2009. The objective of the LPRS is to make the streets and highways safer by removing vehicles not authorized to be on the road. The hotlist plate database can consist of the following types:
* unregistered plate (not paid at DMV/SAAQ)
* stolen vehicles
* AMBER Alert
* wanted vehicles

The LPRS are installed on 10 Sûreté du Québec vehicles. The LPRS integrator is Gtechna. Gtechna is primarily a citations issuance and management software developer which integrates mission critical technologies such as Licence Plate Recognition (LPR) to streamline the enforcement of moving and parking violations.

==In popular culture==
The Sûreté du Québec has become well known internationally through the fictional Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and his colleagues, created by Canadian author Louise Penny, who lives in Quebec. Penny&#x27;s works have been recognized in Quebec by her being made a Member of the Order of Quebec.

The Three Pines series on Amazon Prime Video, inspired by the books, also includes characters who are police officers with the Sûreté du Québec, including Gamache.

<text>George Robert Lazenby (; born 5 September 1939) is an Australian retired actor. Lazenby began his professional career as a model and had only acted in commercials when he was cast to replace the original Bond actor, Sean Connery, playing the character in &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1969). Since he appeared in only one film, Lazenby&#x27;s tenure as Bond is the shortest among the actors in the series. He declined to return for subsequent Bond films and instead pursued other roles in &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; (1971), &quot;Who Saw Her Die?&quot; (1972), &quot;The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss&quot; (1974), and &quot;The Man from Hong Kong&quot; (1975).

Lazenby&#x27;s single portrayal of Bond and lack of standing as a favourite in the series, has resulted in his name being used as a metaphor for forgettable, non-iconic acting efforts in other entertainment franchises, and for entities that are largely ignored.

In 2024, Lazenby retired from acting citing his age and wanting to spend more time with his family.

== Early life ==
George Robert Lazenby was born on 5 September 1939 in Goulburn, New South Wales, at Ovada Private Hospital, to railway worker George Edward Lazenby and Fosseys retail worker Sheila Joan Lazenby (née Bodel). He attended Goulburn Public School in his primary years and Goulburn High School until 1954. His sister Barbara was an accomplished dancer. When he was young, he spent 18 months in hospital after he underwent an operation that left him with only half a kidney.

When Lazenby was about 14, he moved with his family from Goulburn to Queanbeyan, where his father ran a store. He served in the Australian Army, then afterwards worked as a car salesman and mechanic.

=== Early jobs and modelling ===
Lazenby moved to London in 1963 to pursue a woman with whom he had fallen in love. He became a car salesman in Finchley, where he was spotted by a talent scout who persuaded him to become a model. He was soon earning £25,000 a year. He was widely known for appearing in an advertisement for Fry&#x27;s chocolate bars. In 1966, he was voted Top Model of the Year.

==James Bond==

In 1968, after Sean Connery had left the role of James Bond, producer Albert R. Broccoli met Lazenby for the first time while they were getting their hair cut at the same barbershop. Broccoli later saw him in the Big Fry commercial and felt he could possibly portray Bond, on which basis he invited him to do a screen test.

Lazenby dressed for the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements, such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Anthony Sinclair tailored suit (Sean Connery’s tailor as James Bond) which had been ordered, but not collected, by Connery.

Broccoli offered him an audition. During the audition, Lazenby accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Director Peter R. Hunt felt that just because Lazenby starred in the movie, it did not make him an actor.

In July 1969, after making &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, Lazenby returned home to Queanbeyan to see his parents. He said he had 18 films to consider, but most of them were bad, adding that he had to &quot;wait and see&quot;. He also told the press, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ready for anything like Hamlet yet but I&#x27;d love to play Ned Kelly.&quot;

Lazenby was offered the chance to portray Bond on film again, in &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;. However, prior to the release of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, Lazenby decided to leave the role of Bond after his agent, Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly, convinced him that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s. Lazenby also felt that he had received poor treatment on the film set. Several of his co-stars felt that Lazenby had made a mistake, including Diana Rigg and Desmond Llewelyn. Lazenby acknowledged the worry but insisted that he had made the correct decision. 

At the time of the release of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, Lazenby&#x27;s performance received mixed reviews. Critics felt that while he was physically convincing, he delivered his lines poorly. In the years since the film was released, public perception has become more positive. Broccoli publicly defended Lazenby&#x27;s performance, saying that while he was not the best actor, he was still great for the role of Bond. He did admit that he found Lazenby&#x27;s post-movie attitude annoying, feeling that he did not respect the character and was arrogant.
Lazenby was considered to reprise the role of James Bond in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;. However, Sean Connery was chosen for the role instead.

Lazenby has appeared as James Bond in various parodies and unofficial 007 roles, including the 1983 television film &quot;The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, where his character is identified only by the initials J. B., and the 1996 video game &quot;Fox Hunt&quot;, parts of which were reedited into a feature film. Additionally, he appeared in an episode of &quot;The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; called &quot;Diamonds Aren&#x27;t Forever.&quot; In 2012, Lazenby made a guest appearance on the Canadian sketch comedy series &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;, spoofing the 007 series in a skit called &quot;Help, I&#x27;ve Skyfallen and I Can&#x27;t Get Up&quot;.

== Post-Bond career ==
Lazenby made another film a year after &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; – &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; (1971), which he helped write. He said the movie was &quot;anti-guns and anti-Bond&quot;. Due to his reported poor treatment on the set of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service,&quot; he sought out a director whom he would work with better and found Cy Endfield. Lazenby helped to fund the film. Lazenby admitted that after he left the role of Bond, he was unhireable. He landed few roles, to the point that his agent described him as &quot;difficult&quot;.

Lazenby next appeared in the 1972 Italian giallo film &quot;Who Saw Her Die?&quot; opposite Anita Strindberg, a performance for which he lost 35 pounds and received positive reviews. He spent the next 15 months sailing around the world with Chrissie Townson; the trip ended when she became pregnant with their first child, prompting Lazenby to settle down and try to reactivate his career as an actor.

In February 1973, he revealed that he had spent all of the money he had earned from playing Bond, had experienced two nervous breakdowns, and had become an alcoholic. He felt that if he had continued in the role, he would have gone crazy due to the mental stress that the role brings. He later said, &quot;I burnt some bridges behind me, and it was fun, really. I&#x27;m sort of glad I did it and I know I won&#x27;t have to do it again. I can look back and laugh because I didn&#x27;t hurt anyone — except myself.&quot;

Lazenby played a role in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; series in 1973, starring in Roger Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Operation&quot;. He was meant to follow it with an Anglo-Italian western made in Turkey, followed by a film about rioting students in pre-Castro Cuba, but neither was made.

===Hong Kong===
In 1973, Lazenby said he was &quot;flat broke&quot; when he went to Hong Kong to meet Bruce Lee and producer Raymond Chow. They ended up offering him $10,000 ($ today) to appear in a film with Lee, which was going to be the Golden Harvest film &quot;Game of Death&quot;. However, the plan collapsed after Lee&#x27;s sudden death. Lazenby was meant to meet Lee for dinner on the day Lee died.

In the end, Lazenby shot three films for Golden Harvest: &quot;The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss&quot;, &quot;The Man from Hong Kong&quot; (1975) (also known as &quot;The Dragon Flies&quot;), and &quot;A Queen&#x27;s Ransom&quot; (1976).

===Australia===
In the mid-1970s, Lazenby appeared in a number of television movies shot in his native Australia, and an episode of the local police drama series &quot;Matlock Police&quot;. He also returned to modelling, appearing in a number of advertisements for Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes. In a 1977 interview with the &quot;Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly,&quot; he stated that he did not really feel like an actor as he had very few acting credits, but hoped that he could find more work.

===Hollywood===

In the late 1970s, Lazenby moved to Hollywood, California, where he started taking acting lessons and set about trying to obtain more acting work.

In 1978, Broccoli described casting Lazenby as his biggest mistake, claiming that the actor couldn&#x27;t deal with fame and labelling him as &quot;very arrogant&quot;. He felt that Lazenby did not understand how a film set worked and did not mesh well with the rest of the cast and crew. Sean Connery came to Lazenby&#x27;s defence, saying that in the time that he knew Lazenby, he had not acted arrogant, instead applying that label to Broccoli.

Lazenby went on to add:
It hasn&#x27;t been easy, trying to climb back... I admit I acted stupidly. It went to my head, everything that was happening to me. But remember, it was my first film... Now what I&#x27;ve got to do is live down my past; convince people I&#x27;m not the same person who made a fool of himself all those years ago. I know I can do it. All I need is the chance.

In 1978, he took out an advertisement in &quot;Variety&quot;, offering himself for acting work in any role for very little money. He told a journalist for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. &quot;People ask me if the Bond movie wasn&#x27;t worth it if it got me into acting. It&#x27;s true that it got me in, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the ten years it cost me.&quot; The following year, he had a substantial supporting role in &quot;Saint Jack&quot; (1979), directed by Peter Bogdanovich. The Australian magazine &quot;Filmink&quot; called it &quot;one of the best things – if not the best thing – Lazenby ever did outside of Bond.&quot;

Lazenby was particularly keen to obtain a role in &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot;, but the project would not be produced until years later, and without him. He did manage to secure roles in &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; and &quot;Evening in Byzantium&quot;. The latter was seen by Harry Saltzman, who offered him a leading role in a proposed science fiction film, &quot;The Micronauts&quot;. Lazenby made a guest appearance as Jor-El on the television series &quot;Superboy&quot;, in a two-part episode during the series&#x27; second season in 1990. He appeared with Sylvia Kristel in several new &quot;Emmanuelle&quot; films in 1993, many of which appeared on cable television. In 1993, Lazenby had a part in the film &quot;Gettysburg&quot; as Confederate General Johnston Pettigrew.

On 5 November 2013, comedian Jim Jefferies stated in an interview that Lazenby would be playing Jefferies&#x27;s father in the then upcoming second season of his FX network sitcom &quot;Legit&quot;. He appeared as himself in the 2017 docudrama &quot;Becoming Bond&quot;. In 2019, Lazenby starred as Dr. Jason Love in an audiobook version of James Leasor&#x27;s spy novel &quot;Passport to Oblivion&quot;.

In 2024, Lazenby announced his retirement from acting and public appearances. He cited his concerns over his age and a desire to spend more time with his family.

==Influence on popular culture==

Lazenby&#x27;s single portrayal of the iconic Bond character, and his lack of standing as a favourite in the series, has resulted in his name being used as a metaphor for forgettable, non-iconic acting efforts in other entertainment franchises, and for entities that are largely ignored.

In his review of &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, widely regarded as the weakest and least successful film in the &quot;Batman&quot; film franchise, Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said that George Clooney &quot;should go down in history as the George Lazenby of the series&quot;. Actor Paul McGann has described himself as &quot;the George Lazenby of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&quot;. McGann&#x27;s only starring television role as the Eighth Doctor was in the 1996 television movie.

In 2009, Sondre Lerche released a song called &quot;Like Lazenby&quot; on his album &quot;Heartbeat Radio&quot;, in which he laments squandered opportunities and wishes for a &quot;second try&quot;. Lerche had received a videotape of the film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; as a child; he sent away for a free copy of the movie, only to find he had joined a James Bond film club. He got into trouble when his mother was contacted to pay for the membership. Years later, watching the movie again on DVD, he found it to be &quot;a perfect metaphor for life&#x27;s disappointments&quot;.

The title of Matthew Bauer&#x27;s 2022 documentary &quot;The Other Fellow&quot;, about the lives of real men named James Bond, is inspired by Lazenby&#x27;s line in the beginning of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, &quot;This never happened to the other fellow&quot;, a reference to Sean Connery. Bauer told &quot;Filmink&quot; that he chose the title because &quot;these are the situations that our characters face – continuously being in the shadow of this movie icon.&quot;

==Personal life==

While working as a car salesman at the age of 21, Lazenby fathered a daughter, Jennifer, with Maureen Powell, who was then an Australian army sergeant and a physical education and fitness instructor at Royal Military College, Duntroon.

In 1973, Lazenby married his girlfriend of three years, Christina Ross &quot;Chrissie&quot; Townson (later Matser), an heiress of the Gannett family. They subsequently had two children, daughter Melanie Andrea Lazenby, born on 13 September 1973, and son Zachary &quot;Zack&quot; Lazenby, born on 9 November 1974, at Woden Valley Hospital (now Canberra Hospital) in Garran, Canberra, ACT. Zachary was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour when he was 11 and died at age 19 in 1994. The two divorced shortly after, in 1995. Melanie is a real estate broker in New York, working for Douglas Elliman. 

In 2002, Lazenby married former tennis player Pam Shriver and they had three children, including son George Junior Lazenby, born on 12 July 2004. The family lived in Brentwood, California. In August 2008, it was reported that Shriver had filed for divorce from Lazenby, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. Their divorce was finalised in May 2011.

In late 2023, Lazenby was injured in a fall and he was briefly hospitalised. On 18 December, he returned home.

<text>In mathematics, a frieze or frieze pattern is a two-dimensional design that repeats in one direction. The term is derived from architecture and decorative arts, where such repeating patterns are often used. (See frieze.) Frieze patterns can be classified into seven types according to their symmetries. The set of symmetries of a frieze pattern is called a frieze group.

Frieze groups are two-dimensional line groups, having repetition in only one direction. They are related to the more complex wallpaper groups, which classify patterns that are repetitive in two directions, and crystallographic groups, which classify patterns that are repetitive in three directions.

==General==

Formally, a frieze group is a class of infinite discrete symmetry groups of patterns on a strip (infinitely wide rectangle), hence a class of groups of isometries of the plane, or of a strip. A symmetry group of a frieze group necessarily contains translations and may contain glide reflections, reflections along the long axis of the strip, reflections along the narrow axis of the strip, and 180° rotations. There are seven frieze groups, listed in the summary table. Many authors present the frieze groups in a different order.

The actual symmetry groups within a frieze group are characterized by the smallest translation distance, and, for the frieze groups with vertical line reflection or 180° rotation (groups 2, 5, 6, and 7), by a shift parameter locating the reflection axis or point of rotation. In the case of symmetry groups in the plane, additional parameters are the direction of the translation vector, and, for the frieze groups with horizontal line reflection, glide reflection, or 180° rotation (groups 3–7), the position of the reflection axis or rotation point in the direction perpendicular to the translation vector. Thus there are two degrees of freedom for group 1, three for groups 2, 3, and 4, and four for groups 5, 6, and 7.

For two of the seven frieze groups (groups 1 and 4) the symmetry groups are singly generated, for four (groups 2, 3, 5, and 6) they have a pair of generators, and for group 7 the symmetry groups require three generators. A symmetry group in frieze group 1, 2, 3, or 5 is a subgroup of a symmetry group in the last frieze group with the same translational distance. A symmetry group in frieze group 4 or 6 is a subgroup of a symmetry group in the last frieze group with &quot;half&quot; the translational distance. This last frieze group contains the symmetry groups of the simplest periodic patterns in the strip (or the plane), a row of dots. Any transformation of the plane leaving this pattern invariant can be decomposed into a translation, , optionally followed by a reflection in either the horizontal axis, , or the vertical axis, , provided that this axis is chosen through or midway between two dots, or a rotation by 180°, (ditto). Therefore, in a way, this frieze group contains the &quot;largest&quot; symmetry groups, which consist of all such transformations.

The inclusion of the &quot;discrete&quot; condition is to exclude the group containing all translations, and groups containing arbitrarily small translations (e.g. the group of horizontal translations by rational distances). Even apart from scaling and shifting, there are infinitely many cases, e.g. by considering rational numbers of which the denominators are powers of a given prime number.

The inclusion of the &quot;infinite&quot; condition is to exclude groups that have no translations:
*the group with the identity only (isomorphic to C1, the trivial group of order 1).
*the group consisting of the identity and reflection in the horizontal axis (isomorphic to C2, the cyclic group of order 2).
*the groups each consisting of the identity and reflection in a vertical axis (ditto)
*the groups each consisting of the identity and 180° rotation about a point on the horizontal axis (ditto)
*the groups each consisting of the identity, reflection in a vertical axis, reflection in the horizontal axis, and 180° rotation about the point of intersection (isomorphic to the Klein four-group)

==Descriptions of the seven frieze groups==
There are seven distinct subgroups (up to scaling and shifting of patterns) in the discrete frieze group generated by a translation, reflection (along the same axis) and a 180° rotation. Each of these subgroups is the symmetry group of a frieze pattern, and sample patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The seven different groups correspond to the 7 infinite series of axial point groups in three dimensions, with &quot;n&quot; = ∞.

They are identified in the table below using Hermann–Mauguin notation, Coxeter notation, Schönflies notation, orbifold notation, nicknames created by mathematician John H. Conway, and finally a description in terms of translation, reflections and rotations.

Of the seven frieze groups, there are only four up to isomorphism. Two are singly generated and isomorphic to formula_1; four of them are doubly generated, among which one is abelian and three are nonabelian and isomorphic to formula_2, the infinite dihedral group; and one of them has three generators.

=== Lattice types: Oblique and rectangular===
The groups can be classified by their type of two-dimensional grid or lattice. The lattice being oblique means that the second direction &quot;need not be orthogonal&quot; to the direction of repeat.

* Kali, a free and open source software application for wallpaper, frieze and other patterns.
* Kali , free downloadable Kali for Windows and Mac Classic.
* Tess, a nagware tessellation program for multiple platforms, supports all wallpaper, frieze, and rosette groups, as well as Heesch tilings.
* FriezingWorkz, a freeware Hypercard stack for the Classic Mac platform that supports all frieze groups.

<text>Coin grading is the process of determining the grade or condition of a coin, one of the key factors in determining its collectible value. A coin&#x27;s grade is generally determined by six criteria: strike, preservation, luster, color, attractiveness, and occasionally the country/state in which it was minted. Several grading systems have been developed. Certification services professionally grade coins for tiered fees.

==Overview==
A &quot;grade&quot; measures a coin&#x27;s appearance. There are generally five main components which determine a coin&#x27;s grade: strike, surface preservation, luster, coloration and eye appeal. Grading is subjective and even experts can disagree about the grade of a given coin.

===History===

U.S. coin grading has evolved over the years to a system of finer and finer grade distinctions. Originally, there were only two grades, new and used. This changed to the letter grading system beginning with the lowest grade – &quot;Basal State&quot; (also &quot;Poor&quot; (PO)), then continuing &quot;Fair&quot; (Fr), &quot;About&quot; or &quot;Almost Good&quot; (AG), &quot;Good&quot; (G), &quot;Very Good&quot; (VG), &quot;Fine&quot; (F), &quot;Very Fine&quot; (VF), &quot;Extremely Fine&quot; (EF), &quot;Almost&quot; or &quot;About Uncirculated&quot; (AU), &quot;Uncirculated&quot; (Unc) and up to &quot;Brilliant Uncirculated&quot; (BU). &quot;Gem Uncirculated&quot; was roughly equivalent in usage to BU at that time. Numerical grades from 1 to 70 now accompany the verbal grades.

== Systems ==

=== Early grading systems ===
The quality of all coins is not equal and collectors felt the necessity of defining the quality of the coins in order to assess their value. Rim damage, nicks, polishing, cleaning, scratches and other forms of wear are considered factors in grading a coin. Whether or not a coin shows evidence of having been mounted in jewelry also affects its grade.

In the early years of coin collecting, three general terms were used to grade coins:

* good - when circulation had worn the surface of the coin, but major details were still visible.
* fine - when features were less worn and a bit of mint luster showed on the surface. Most major and minor detail visible
* uncirculated - when the features of the coin were sharp and the luster approaching the state of a new coin at the mint.

=== Sheldon grading system ===

As the collector market for coins grew rapidly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it became apparent that a more precise grading standard was needed. Some coins were simply more fine than others, and some uncirculated coins showed more luster and far fewer marks than others. Terms like &quot;gem uncirculated&quot; and &quot;very fine&quot; began to see use, as more precise grading descriptions allowed for more precise pricing for the booming collector market.

In 1948, well-known numismatist William Herbert Sheldon attempted to standardize coin grading by proposing what is now known as the Sheldon Scale, as is detailed below. , included in his book &quot;Penny Whimsy&quot;, was originally devised for U.S. large cents but it is now applied to all series.

=== European grading system ===

European countries use various, roughly equivalent, grading systems. The main features of their systems are presented in the following table:

== American Numismatic Association scale==

As the hobby of numismatics evolved, the need arose for a more concrete grading system. In 1978, the American Numismatic Association published the &quot;Official A.N.A. Grading System for United States Coins&quot;. It established grading tiers of, in descending order of preservation, &quot;Mint State&quot;, &quot;About Uncirculated&quot;, &quot;Extremely Fine&quot;, &quot;Very Fine&quot;, &quot;Fine&quot;, &quot;Very Good&quot;, &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;About Good&quot;. Most numismatists, as well as third-party grading services, also use two other descriptors for the lowest grades, &quot;Fair&quot; and &quot;Poor&quot;. The higher tiers on this scale each encompass two or more &quot;sub-grades&quot; denoted by the appending of the corresponding Sheldon scale number, such as &quot;Very Fine-20&quot; or &quot;Very Fine-30&quot;. This allows for the recognition of coins which exceed the standard for a given tier, but do not meet the criteria for the next. Grades are commonly abbreviated, and not all numismatists use the numerical grades, so a grade of &quot;Fine-12&quot; may be rendered as &quot;Fine&quot;, &quot;F-12&quot;, &quot;12&quot; or simply &quot;F&quot;.

==Factors affecting a coin grade==

The following factors affect a coin&#x27;s numerical grade:

# &quot;eye appeal&quot; or the aesthetic interest of the coin;
# dents on the rim;
# unsightly scratches or other blemishes on the surface of the coin;
# luster;
# toning;
# level of detail retained, where a coin with full details obviously is valued higher than one with worn details. 
# If the coin is judged favorably in all of these criteria, it will generally be awarded a higher grade.

==Certification services==
Coin certification services emerged in the 1980s as a response to the need for buyers and sellers to agree on grading. For tiered fees, certification services grade, authenticate, attribute, and encapsulate coins in clear, plastic holders. Professional Coin Grading service (PCGS), Numismatic Guaranty Corporation (NGC), Independent Coin Graders (ICG), and American Numismatic Association Certification Service (ANACS) are the most popular services. These are the only services whose coins have a special section on eBay, the largest rare coin marketplace. All four firms guarantee the grades and authenticity of their certified coins. Together they have certified over 80 million coins.

At each of the four main grading companies, a similar process is used. Each coin is graded (on a verbal and 1 to 70 numerical scale) and authenticated by two or more graders, and then assigned a final grade by a finalizer, based in part upon the recommendations of the prior graders. Depending on the company, various descriptors may be added, such as Full Bands for Mercury dimes, Full Bell Lines (FBL) for Franklin Half Dollars, or Deep Mirror Prooflike (DMPL) for Morgan dollars, and the coin&#x27;s die variety may be noted. The coin is then slabbed and returned to the customer. In 2010, PCGS and NGC introduced &quot;Plus&quot; grading for high-end coins graded XF45 to MS68. A plus symbol (+) is added after the grade.

In 2007, the Professional Numismatists Guild (PNG), a US association of rare coin dealers, released the results of a survey of major coin dealers who gave their professional opinions about 11 certification services. PCGS and NGC were rated &quot;Superior&quot; overall, with ANACS and ICG deemed &quot;Good&quot;. PCI and SEGS were listed as &quot;Poor&quot;, while called &quot;Unacceptable&quot; were Accugrade (ACG), Numistrust Corporation (NTC), Hallmark Coin Grading Service (HCGS), American Coin Club Grading Service (ACCGS), and Star Grading Services (SGS).

Counterfeit NGC and PCGS holders have been reported, but significant measures have been taken by both services to remedy the problem, such as NGC&#x27;s use of photographic verification for every coin certified and both services&#x27; employment of serial number verification and anti-counterfeiting features in their holders.

<text>Ælfsige (or Aelfsige, Ælfsin or Aelfsin; died 959) was Bishop of Winchester before he became Archbishop of Canterbury in 959.

==Life==
Ælfsige became Bishop of Winchester in 951. In 958, with the death of the previous Archbishop Oda, he was translated from the see of Winchester to become archbishop of Canterbury. He is said by Arthur Hussey to have trampled contemptuously on Oda&#x27;s grave, &quot;with reproaches for having so long kept himself out of that dignity&quot;.

Ælfsige died of cold in the Alps as he journeyed to Rome to be given his pallium by Pope John XII. In his place King Eadwig nominated Byrhthelm. Ælfsige&#x27;s will survives and shows that he was married, with a son, Godwine of Worthy, who died in 1001 fighting against the Vikings.

<text>Austin-Healey was a British sports car maker established in 1952 through a joint venture between the Austin division of the British Motor Corporation (BMC) and the Donald Healey Motor Company (Healey), a renowned automotive engineering and design firm. Leonard Lord represented BMC and Donald Healey his firm.

BMC merged with Jaguar Cars in 1966 to form British Motor Holdings (BMH). Donald Healey left BMH in 1968 when it merged into British Leyland. Healey then joined Jensen Motors, which had been making bodies for the &quot;big Healeys&quot; since their inception in 1952, and became their chairman in 1972. Austin-Healey cars were produced until 1972 when the 20-year agreement between Healey and Austin came to an end.

==Racing==
The Austin Healey was extensively raced by the Donald Healey Motor Company in Europe at Le Mans and at Sebring in the U.S., in classic rallies by the BMC competitions department, and was recognised from the very beginning by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA). Healey models raced in club racing in D, E, F, G, an H production classes, winning National Championships in all five classes. The last Big Healey to win an SCCA National Championship was the class E Production Austin-Healey 100-6 driven by Alan Barker at the Daytona ARRC in 1965. 

In 1953, a special streamlined Austin-Healey set several land speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA.

==Attempts at revival==
The rights to the Austin name later passed to British Aerospace and later BMW when each bought the Rover Group. In 2001, BMW revealed the “Project Warwick” concept, a retro-styled, modern interpretation of the Austin Healey built around the aluminium chassis from the BMW Z8. It is believed that Project Warwick advanced sufficiently enough to necessitate talks with the Healey family, although these talks ultimately broke down and the project was cancelled due to a lack of marque ownership rights. BMW later sold the Rover group to the Phoenix Consortium for a nominal £10, creating the MG Rover Group.

During the sale of the MG Rover group following its bankruptcy, Professor Krish Bhaskar, a bidder for the company, revealed the Austin Healey 3000 inspired “Project Tempest” in 2005. Bhaskar stated that the car would use running gear from the MG XPower SV covered with a lightweight aluminium body. Bhaskar’s bid failed however, and the project never came to fruition.

The Austin name was subsequently owned by China&#x27;s Nanjing Automobile Group, which bought the assets of MG Rover Group out of bankruptcy in 2005. Nanjing signed a collaborative agreement with GB Sports Car, a company founded by former Rover officials, aiming to bring back production at the Longbridge plant under the MG, Rover and Austin-Healey marques, with the MG XPower SV being rebadged as an Austin-Healey. The idea to produce Austin-Healey branded cars was later dropped and the deal subsequently stalled.

After Donald Healey sold his original Donald Healey Motor Company, the Healey brand was registered to a new firm, Healey Automobile Consultants; the Healey family sold this successor company to British-American consortium HFI Automotive in 2005. In February 2006, HFI Automotive announced plans for a sports car “with the DNA of a Healey 3000” in coupe and convertible versions, as well as a cheaper car likened to an Austin Healey Sprite. HFI announced that deposits of £1000 were being taken, and prototypes were to be shown later that year. No prototypes were shown, but it was reported that HFI developed and tested a running prototype.

In June 2007, Nanjing and Healey Automobile Consultants / HFI Automotive signed a collaborative agreement aiming to recreate the Austin Healey and Healey marques alongside NAC&#x27;s MG. No timeline was given for the Healey and Austin-Healey brands to return, although production of the MG TF restarted in August that year, and the first all-new MG-branded model in 16 years, the MG6, was launched 4 years later in 2011.

The Nanjing Automobile Group later merged with the much larger SAIC Motor, transferring many former British assets including the Austin marque to SAIC.

In 2015, British company Healy Designs revealed the &#x27;Enigma&#x27;, a Mazda MX-5 based modern interpretation of a Big Healey. The kit car features a retro style fibreglass body atop an MX-5 chassis, with either a 2.0 litre Mazda engine or a larger V8 from a Lexus or Corvette.

<text>Donald Healey Motor Company Limited was a British car manufacturer.

==History==
The business was founded in 1945 by Donald Healey, a successful car designer and rally driver. Healey discussed sports car design with Achille Sampietro, a chassis specialist for high performance cars and Ben Bowden, a body engineer, when all three worked at Humber during World War II.

==Healey motorcars==
Healey&#x27;s new enterprise focused on producing high-quality, high-performance cars which were inevitably expensive. It was initially based in the premises of Benford Ltd (who made cement mixers and dumpers) at The Cape in Warwick, but soon moved into an old aircraft components factory on the adjacent Millers Road Industrial Estate. There Healey was joined by Roger Menadue from Armstrong Whitworth to run the experimental workshop and subsequently by his son Geoffrey, who had qualified as an engineer. On 3 July 1963 (not 1961 as is often stated) they moved again into the former Warwick Cinema at Coten End. Both these premises have now been demolished: a block of flats has been built on the cinema site, called – much to Geoff&#x27;s disgust – &#x27;Healey Court&#x27;. 
The cars mainly used a tuned version of the proven Riley twin-cam 2.4-litre four-cylinder engine in a light steel box-section chassis of Healey design using independent front suspension by coil springs and alloy trailing arms with Girling dampers. The rear suspension used a Riley live axle with coil springs. The suspension design allowed soft springing to be combined with excellent road holding. Lockheed hydraulic brakes were used.

When it was introduced in 1948, the Elliott saloon was claimed to be the fastest production closed car in the world, timed at 104.7 mph over a mile. The aerodynamic body design was the work of Benjamin Bowden and unusually for the time it was tested in a wind tunnel to refine its efficiency. This was the start of Healey&#x27;s aerodynamic styling for reduced drag, that culminated in Bowden&#x27;s last UK offering, the Zethrin Rennsport. In 1949 the most sporting of all the Healeys, the Silverstone, was announced. It had a shorter chassis and stiffer springing and was capable of 107 mph. It is now a highly sought after car, and many of the other remaining Healeys have been converted into Silverstone replicas. These cars had numerous competition successes including class wins in the 1947 and 1948 Alpine rallies and the 1949 Mille Miglia.

===Nash-Healey===
Government planning and controls in this time period required any substantial expansion of production to be for the export market alone. So in 1950 Healey entered the North American market with the Nash-Healey, using a Nash Ambassador engine with SU carburettors and Nash gearbox. Initially the Ambassador&#x27;s 3848 cc engine was used, but when in 1952 body construction was transferred from Healey to Pininfarina the larger 4138 cc engine was fitted.

===Production numbers===
The final Healey car of this era was the G-Type, using an Alvis TB21 engine and gearbox. This was more luxurious (and heavier) than the Riley engined models, and performance suffered.



==Austin-Healey==

Healey judged a cheaper sports car marketable in large numbers was needed to save the business, one that would fit between the MG and Jaguar cars then selling so well in USA. Working with his eldest son Geoffrey in the attic of the family home, Healey designed a two-seat roadster employing numerous low-cost Austin components, the Healey Hundred. Austin chief Sir Leonard Lord was so impressed when he saw it on the Healey stand at the 1952 Earls Court Motor Show he offered to make it in his own factories under the name Austin-Healey 100.

The result was a 1953 a joint venture which created the Austin-Healey marque with the British Motor Corporation manufacturing the cars and the Healey company doing the designs and running racing operations. The 100 evolved into the highly regarded and collector coveted 3-litre Austin-Healey 3000, and the diminutive 950cc Austin-Healey Sprite, known affectionately as the &quot;frog-eye&quot; or &quot;Bugeye&quot; was also manufactured.

Commenting on the 3000 after Donald Healey&#x27;s death &quot;The Times&quot; observed: &quot;The big Healey&#x27;s brutally firm ride, heavy steering and engine so close it would roast a driver&#x27;s feet never detracted from the superb, timeless styling and classic proportions.&quot;

==Jensen-Healey==
Donald Healey became a director of Jensen Motors in the late 1960s and a result of this was the Lotus-engined Jensen-Healey which appeared in 1972.

==Sale==
Donald Healey Motor Company was finally sold to the Hamblin Group, although Healey Automobile Consultants and the engineering parts of the company remained in the hands of Geoffrey and Donald Healey.

<text>Hunter Doherty &quot;Patch&quot; Adams (born May 28, 1945) is an American physician, comedian, social activist, clown, and author. He founded the Gesundheit! Institute as a not-for-profit in 1989. Each year he also organizes volunteers from around the world to travel to various countries where they dress as clowns to bring humor to orphans, patients, and other people.

Adams is currently based in Urbana, Illinois. In collaboration with the institute, he promotes an alternative health care model not funded by insurance policies.

==Early life and education==
Adams was born on May 28, 1945, in Washington, D.C., the son of Anna Campbell Stewart (née Hunter) and Robert Loughridge Adams. His maternal grandfather, Thomas Lomax Hunter, was a Poet Laureate of Virginia. His father, a United States Army officer who fought in Korea, died while stationed in West Germany when Adams was only 16. After his father&#x27;s death, Adams returned to the United States with his mother and brother. Adams has stated that upon his return he encountered racism and segregation amongst his peers against which he stood up, and this made him a target for bullies at school. As a result, Adams was unhappy and became actively suicidal. After a third hospitalization in one year he decided &quot;you don&#x27;t kill yourself, stupid; you make revolution.&quot;

He attended Wakefield High School, where he graduated in 1963, and then completed pre-med coursework at George Washington University. He began medical school without an undergraduate degree, and earned his Doctor of Medicine degree at the Medical College of Virginia in the Virginia Commonwealth University in 1971. In the late 1960s, one of his closest friends (a man, not a woman as depicted in the film) was murdered by a deranged patient. Convinced of the powerful connection between environment and wellness, he believes the health of an individual cannot be separated from the health of the family, community, and the world.

===Gesundheit! Institute===
Soon after graduation, Patch, his wife Linda, and friends started to develop the ideas that eventually led to The Gesundheit! Institute. Originally as the Zanies, they ran as a communal &quot;home&quot; from 1971 to 1984. In 1989 Gesundheit! Institute was founded as a not-for-profit, and has continued to develop to this day. Based in Adams&#x27; rural West Virginia property, the institute has since been devoted to fundraising. The latest plan is for a 44-bed community hospital building that will offer free holistic care to &quot;anyone who wants it&quot;, along with a teaching facility that can accommodate &quot;120 staff, all living together in the communal ecovillage&quot;.

Fees from the 1998 movie &quot;made it possible to build three beautiful buildings... in preparation for the big buildings we want for the hospital&quot;. These are a farmhouse, workshop and dacha that accommodate the workshops and courses offered by the institute. The educational philosophy is contained in their &quot;School for Designing a Society (SDaS) – for people who want to change society by means of desire, design, and composition...&quot; and includes courses on caring and workshops on clowning.

Adams was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award on January 29, 1997.

In 2008, Adams agreed to become honorary chair of the &quot;International Association for the Advancement of Creative Maladjustment&quot; or IAACM. MindFreedom International, a nonprofit coalition that Gesundheit! belongs to as a sponsor group, launched the IAACM to support &quot;creative maladjustment&quot; and social change.

Since the 1990s Adams has supported the Ithaca Health Alliance (IHA) in Ithaca, New York, founded as the Ithaca Health Fund (IHF) by Paul Glover. In January 2006, IHA launched the Ithaca Free Clinic, bringing to life key aspects of Adams&#x27;s vision. Adams has also given strong praise to &quot;Health Democracy&quot;, Glover&#x27;s book written and published the same year.

As of 2016, Adams claims to &quot;lecture 300 days out of the year, and have done so for over 30 years in 81 countries, spreading seeds of a love revolution of enlivening community and a call to end capitalism&quot;.

==In media==

The 1998 film &quot;Patch Adams&quot; was based on Adams&#x27;s life and his views on medicine. Adams has heavily criticized the film, saying it eschewed an accurate representation of his beliefs in favor of commercial viability. He said that out of all aspects of his life and activism, the film portrayed him merely as a funny doctor. Patch Adams also said of Robin Williams in an interview, &quot;He made $21 million for four months of pretending to be me, in a very simplistic version, and did not give $10 to my free hospital. Patch Adams, the person, would have, if I had Robin&#x27;s money, given &quot;all&quot; $21 million to a free hospital in a country where 80 million cannot get care.&quot;

In another interview, Adams clarified that he did not dislike Williams, saying, &quot;I think Robin himself is compassionate, generous and funny. I like to think that that&#x27;s who I am, and so I think he was the only actor I wanted to play me, and I think he did a fabulous job.&quot; Williams also had actively supported St. Jude Children&#x27;s Research Hospital for several years.

Upon hearing of Williams&#x27; suicide, Adams released a statement that praised Williams&#x27; comedic and improvisational skills on set; noted his compassionate and caring nature; remarked upon his introverted demeanour in private, and his desire for solitude; and thanked him for &quot;his wonderful performance&quot;.

As a speaker, Adams travels around the globe lecturing about his medicine methods.

==Personal life==
While working in an adolescent clinic at VCU School of Medicine, in his final year of med school, he met Linda Edquist, a fellow VCU student who volunteered in the clinic. Adams and Edquist married in 1975, and had two sons, Atomic Zagnut &quot;Zag&quot; Adams and Lars Zig Edquist Adams; they divorced in 1998.

In March 2021, Adams announced that his left foot had been amputated in a below-the-knee amputation due to persistent problems from an MRSA infection.

<text>A value chain is a progression of activities that a business or firm performs in order to deliver goods and services of value to an end customer. The concept comes from the field of business management and was first described by Michael Porter in his 1985 best-seller, &quot;Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance&quot;.
According to the OECD Secretary-General , the emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises .

==Role of the business unit==
According to Porter, the appropriate level for constructing a value chain is the business unit within a business, not a business division or the company as a whole. Porter is concerned that analysis at the higher company levels may hide certain sources of competitive advantage only visible at the business unit level.

Products pass through a chain of activities in order, and at each activity the product gains some value. The chain of activities gives the products more added value than the sum of added values of all activities.
===Primary activities===
All five primary activities are essential in adding value and creating a competitive advantage and they are:

*Inbound logistics: arranging the inbound movement of materials, parts, and/or finished inventory from suppliers to manufacturing or assembly plants, warehouses, or retail stores
*Operations: concerned with managing the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services).
*Outbound logistics: is the process related to the storage and movement of the final product and the related information flows from the end of the production line to the end user
*Marketing and sales: selling products and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.
*Service: includes all the activities required to keep the product working effectively for the buyer after it is sold and delivered.

Companies can harness a competitive advantage at any one of the five activities in the value chain. For example, by creating outbound logistics that are highly efficient or by reducing a company&#x27;s shipping costs, it allows to either realize more profits or pass the savings to the consumer by way of lower prices.

===Support activities===
Using support activities helps make primary activities more effective. Increasing any of the four support activities helps at least one primary activity to work more efficiently.
*Infrastructure: consists of activities such as accounting, legal, finance, control, public relations, quality assurance and general (strategic) management.
*Technological development: pertains to the equipment, hardware, software, procedures and technical knowledge brought to bear in the firm&#x27;s transformation of inputs(Raw materials) into outputs (finished goods).
*Human resources management: consists of all activities involved in recruiting, hiring, training, developing, compensating and (if necessary) dismissing or laying off personnel.
*Procurement: the acquisition of goods, services or works from an outside external source. In this field company also makes decisions of purchases.

===Virtual value chain===
The virtual value chain, created by John Sviokla and Jeffrey Rayport, is a business model describing the dissemination of value-generating information services throughout an Extended Enterprise. This value chain begins with the content supplied by the provider, which is then distributed and supported by the information infrastructure; thereupon the context provider supplies actual customer interaction. It supports the &quot;physical value chain&quot; of procurement, manufacturing, distribution and sales of traditional companies.

==Industry-level==

An industry value-chain is a physical representation of the various processes involved in producing goods (and services), starting with raw materials and ending with the delivered product (also known as the supply chain). It is based on the notion of value-added at the link (read: stage of production) level. The sum total of link-level value-added yields total value. The French Physiocrats&#x27; &quot;Tableau économique&quot; is one of the earliest examples of a value chain. Wassily Leontief&#x27;s input-output tables, published in the 1950s, provide estimates of the relative importance of each individual link in industry-level value-chains for the U.S. economy.

== Global value chains ==
=== Cross border / cross region value chains ===
Often multinational enterprises (MNEs) developed global value chains, investing abroad and establishing affiliates that provided critical support to remaining activities at home. To enhance efficiency and to optimize profits, multinational enterprises locate &quot;research, development, design, assembly, production of parts, marketing and branding&quot; activities in different countries around the globe. MNEs offshore labour-intensive activities to China and Mexico, for example, where the cost of labor is the lowest . The emergence of global value chains (GVCs) in the late 1990s provided a catalyst for accelerated change in the landscape of international investment and trade, with major, far-reaching consequences on governments as well as enterprises.

=== Global value chains in development===
Through global value chains, there has been a growth in interconnectedness as MNEs play an increasingly larger role in the internationalisation of business. In response, governments have cut corporate income tax rates or introduced new incentives for research and development to compete in this changing geopolitical landscape .

In an (industrial) development context, the concepts of global value chain analysis were first introduced in the 1990s (Gereffi et al.) and have gradually been integrated into development policy by the World Bank, Unctad, the OECD and others.

Value chain analysis has also been employed in the development sector as a means of identifying poverty reduction strategies by upgrading along the value chain. Although commonly associated with export-oriented trade, development practitioners have begun to highlight the importance of developing national and intra-regional chains in addition to international ones.

For example, the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has investigated strengthening the value chain for sweet sorghum as a biofuel crop in India. Its aim in doing so was to provide a sustainable means of making ethanol that would increase the incomes of the rural poor, without sacrificing food and fodder security, while protecting the environment.

==Significance==
The value chain framework quickly made its way to the forefront of management thought as a powerful analysis tool for strategic planning. The simpler concept of value stream mapping, a cross-functional process which was developed over the next decade, had some success in the early 1990s.

The value-chain concept has been extended beyond individual firms. It can apply to whole supply chains and distribution networks. The delivery of a mix of products (goods and services) to the end customer will mobilize different economic factors, each managing its own value chain. The industry wide synchronized interactions of those local value chains create an extended value chain, sometimes global in extent. Porter terms this larger interconnected system of value chains the &quot;value system&quot;. A value system includes the value chains of a firm&#x27;s supplier (and their suppliers all the way back), the firm itself, the firm distribution channels, and the firm&#x27;s buyers (and presumably extended to the buyers of their products, and so on).

Capturing the value generated along the chain is the new approach taken by many management strategists. For example, a manufacturer might require its parts suppliers to be located nearby its assembly plant to minimize the cost of transportation. By exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain, the firms may try to bypass the intermediaries creating new business models, or in other ways create improvements in its value system.

==SCOR==
The Supply-Chain Council, a global trade consortium in operation with over 700 member companies, governmental, academic, and consulting groups participating in the last 10 years, manages the Supply-Chain Operations Reference (SCOR), the &quot;de facto&quot; universal reference model for Supply Chain including Planning, Procurement, Manufacturing, Order Management, Logistics, Returns, and Retail; Product and Service Design including Design Planning, Research, Prototyping, Integration, Launch and Revision, and Sales including CRM, Service Support, Sales, and Contract Management which are congruent to the Porter framework. The &quot;SCOR&quot; framework has been adopted by hundreds of companies as well as national entities as a standard for business excellence, and the U.S. Department of Defense has adopted the newly launched Design-Chain Operations Reference (DCOR) framework for product design as a standard to use for managing their development processes. In addition to process elements, these reference frameworks also maintain a vast database of standard process metrics aligned to the Porter model, as well as a large and constantly researched database of prescriptive universal best practices for process execution.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, England.

An organisation of Wheelwrights and Coachmakers petitioned for incorporation in 1630. The petition was granted forty years later, in 1670, when a royal charter was granted to the Wheelwrights. (The Coachmakers were separately incorporated in 1677.) The Wheelwrights&#x27; Company was granted the status of a Livery Company in 1763. Over the years, wheel making has largely changed from being hand-made by craftsmen to being made by machines. Whilst there are a number of working wheelwrights still practising the ancient craft, which the company actively supports through its apprenticeship scheme, the company is no longer a trade association for wheelwrights. Instead, it functions largely as a charitable body focusing on mobility.

The Wheelwrights&#x27; Company ranks sixty-eighth in the order of precedence for Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;God Grant Unity&quot;.

<doc id="375540" wikidata="Q1506365" url="?curid=375540" title="Great Migration (African American)">
<text>The Great Migration, sometimes known as the Great Northward Migration or the Black Migration, was the movement of six million African Americans out of the rural Southern United States to the urban Northeast, Midwest, and West between 1910 and 1970. It was substantially caused by poor economic and social conditions due to prevalent racial segregation and discrimination in the Southern states where Jim Crow laws were upheld. In particular, continued lynchings motivated a portion of the migrants, as African Americans searched for social reprieve. The historic change brought by the migration was amplified because the migrants, for the most part, moved to the then-largest cities in the United States (New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Washington, D.C.) at a time when those cities had a central cultural, social, political, and economic influence over the United States; there, African Americans established culturally influential communities of their own. According to Isabel Wilkerson, despite the losses they felt leaving their homes in the South, and despite the barriers which the migrants faced in their new homes, the migration was an act of individual and collective agency, which changed the course of American history, a &quot;declaration of independence&quot; which was written by their actions.

From the earliest U.S. population statistics in 1780 until 1910, more than 90% of the African-American population lived in the American South, making up the majority of the population in three Southern states, namely Louisiana (until about 1890), South Carolina (until the 1920s), and Mississippi (until the 1930s). But by the end of the Great Migration, just over half of the African-American population lived in the South, while a little less than half lived in the North and West. Moreover, the African-American population had become highly urbanized. In 1900, only one-fifth of African Americans in the South were living in urban areas. By 1960, half of the African Americans in the South lived in urban areas, and by 1970, more than 80% of African Americans nationwide lived in cities. In 1991, Nicholas Lemann wrote:

Some historians analyse the Great Migration in two parts, a first Great Migration (1910–40), during which about 1.6 million people moved from mostly rural areas in the South to northern industrial cities, and a Second Great Migration (1940–70), which began after the Great Depression and during it, at least five million people—including townspeople with urban skills—moved to the North and West.

Since the Civil Rights Movement, the trend has reversed, with more African Americans moving to the South, albeit far more slowly. Dubbed the New Great Migration, these moves were generally spurred by the economic difficulties of cities in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States, growth of jobs in the &quot;New South&quot; and its lower cost of living, family and kinship ties, and lessening discrimination.

== Causes ==
The primary factors for migration among southern African Americans were segregation, indentured servitude, convict leasing, an increase in the spread of racist ideology, widespread lynching (nearly 3,500 African Americans were lynched between 1882 and 1968), and lack of social and economic opportunities in the South. Some factors pulled migrants to the north, such as labor shortages in northern factories brought about by World War I, resulting in thousands of jobs in steel mills, railroads, meatpacking plants, and the automobile industry. The pull of jobs in the north was strengthened by the efforts of labor agents sent by northern businessmen to recruit southern workers. Northern companies offered special incentives to encourage Black workers to relocate, including free transportation and low-cost housing.

During World War I, there was a decline in European immigrants, which slowed the supply of workers for Northern factories. Around 1.2 million European immigrants arrived during 1914 while only 300,000 arrived the next year. The enlistment of workers into the military had also affected the labor supply. This created a wartime opportunity in the North for African Americans, as the Northern industry sought a new labor supply from the South.

There were many advantages for Northern jobs compared to Southern jobs including wages that could be double or more. The southern sharecropping system, an agricultural depression, the widespread infestation of the cotton boll weevil, and flooding also provided motivation for African Americans to move into the Northern Cities. The South&#x27;s pervasive exclusion of African Americans from political power, their lack of representation, and a dearth of social opportunities - in a culture regulated by Jim Crow laws - also motivated African Americans to migrate Northward.

== First Great Migration (1910–1940) ==
When the Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863, less than 8% of the African-American population lived in the Northeastern or Midwestern United States. This began to change over the next decade to such an extent that a U.S. Senate committee ordered an investigation into the causes of the mass migration from the South during the preceding decade, especially to Kansas, where many sought refuge. In 1900, about 90% of Black Americans still lived in Southern states.

Between 1910 and 1930, the African-American population increased by about 40% in Northern states as a result of the migration, mostly in the major cities. The cities of Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Baltimore, and New York City had some of the biggest increases in the early part of the twentieth century. Tens of thousands of Black workers were recruited for industrial jobs, such as positions related to the expansion of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Because changes were concentrated in cities, which had also attracted millions of new or recent European immigrants, tensions rose as the people competed for jobs and scarce housing. Tensions were often most severe between ethnic Irish, defending their recently gained positions and territory, and recent immigrants and Black people.

=== Tensions and violence ===
With the migration of African Americans northward and the mixing of White and Black workers in factories, the tension was building, largely driven by White workers. The AFL, the American Federation of Labor, advocated the separation between European Americans and African Americans in the workplace. There were non-violent protests such as walk-outs in protest of having Blacks and Whites working together. As tension was building due to advocating for segregation in the workplace, violence soon erupted.

In 1917, the East St. Louis riot, known for one of the bloodiest workplace riots, had between 40 and 200 killed and more than 6000 African Americans displaced from their homes. The NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, responded to the violence with a march known as the Silent March. More than 10,000 African-American men and women demonstrated in Harlem, New York. Conflicts continued post World War I, as African Americans continued to face conflicts and tension while the African-American labor activism continued.

In the late summer and autumn of 1919, racial tensions became violent and came to be known as the Red Summer. This period of time was defined by violence and prolonged rioting between Black and White Americans in major United States cities. The reasons for this violence vary. Cities that were affected by the violence included Washington D.C., Chicago, Omaha, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Elaine, Arkansas, a small rural town southwest of Memphis.

The race riots peaked in Chicago, with the most violence and death occurring there during the riots. The authors of &quot;The Negro in Chicago; a study of race relations and a race riot&quot;, an official report from 1922 on race relations in Chicago, came to the conclusion that there were many factors that led to the violent outbursts in Chicago. Principally, many Black workers had assumed the jobs of white men who went to go fight in World War I. As the war ended in 1918, many men returned home to find out their jobs had been taken by Black men who were willing to work for far less.

By the time the rioting and violence had subsided in Chicago, 38 people had lost their lives, with 500 more injured. Additionally, $250,000 worth of property was destroyed, and more than a thousand persons were left homeless. In other cities across the nation many more had been affected by the violence of the Red Summer. The Red Summer enlightened many to the growing racial tension in America. The violence in these major cities prefaced the soon to follow Harlem Renaissance, an African-American cultural revolution, in the 1920s. Racial violence appeared again in Chicago in the 1940s and in Detroit as well as other cities in the Northeast as racial tensions over housing and employment discrimination grew.

=== Continued migration ===

James Gregory calculates decade-by-decade migration volumes in his book &quot;The Southern Diaspora.&quot; Black migration picked up from the start of the new century, with 204,000 leaving in the first decade. The pace accelerated with the outbreak of World War I and continued through the 1920s. By 1930, there were 1.3 million former southerners living in other regions.

The Great Depression wiped out job opportunities in the northern industrial belt, especially for African Americans, and caused a sharp reduction in migration. In the 1930s and 1940s, increasing mechanization of agriculture virtually brought the institution of sharecropping that had existed since the Civil War to an end in the United States causing many landless Black farmers to be forced off of the land.

As a result, approximately 1.4 million Black southerners moved north or west in the 1940s, followed by 1.1 million in the 1950s, and another 2.4 million people in the 1960s and early 1970s. By the late 1970s, as deindustrialization and the Rust Belt crisis took hold, the Great Migration came to an end. But, in a reflection of changing economics, as well as the end of Jim Crow laws in the 1960s and improving race relations in the South, in the 1980s and early 1990s, more Black Americans were heading South than leaving that region.

African Americans moved from the 14 states of the South, especially Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Georgia.

== Second Great Migration (mid 1940s–1970) ==

The Great Depression of the 1930s resulted in reduced migration because of decreased opportunities. With the defense buildup for World War II and with the post-war economic prosperity, migration was revived, with larger numbers of Black Americans leaving the South through the 1960s. This wave of migration often resulted in overcrowding of urban areas due to exclusionary housing policies meant to keep African-American families out of developing suburbs. For example, in the New York and northern New Jersey suburbs 67,000 mortgages were insured by the G.I. Bill, but fewer than 100 were taken out by non-whites.

==Migration patterns==

Big cities were the principal destinations of southerners throughout the two phases of the Great Migration. In the first phase, eight major cities attracted two-thirds of the migrants: New York and Chicago, followed in order by Philadelphia, St. Louis, Detroit, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, and Indianapolis. The Second great Black migration increased the populations of these cities while adding others as destinations, including the Western states. Western cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, Phoenix, Denver, Seattle, and Portland also attracted African Americans in large numbers.

There were clear migratory patterns that linked particular states and cities in the South to corresponding destinations in the North and West. Almost half of those who migrated from Mississippi during the first Great Migration, for example, ended up in Chicago, while those from Virginia tended to move to Philadelphia. For the most part, these patterns were related to geography (i.e. longitude), with the closest cities attracting the most migrants (such as Los Angeles and San Francisco receiving a disproportionate number of migrants from Texas and Louisiana). When multiple destinations were equidistant, chain migration played a larger role, with migrants following the path set by those before them.

African Americans from the South also migrated to industrialized Southern cities, in addition to northward and westward to war-boom cities. There was an increase in Louisville&#x27;s defense industries, making it a vital part of America&#x27;s effort into World War II and Louisville&#x27;s economy. Industries ranged from producing synthetic rubber, smokeless powders, artillery shells, and vehicle parts. Many industries also converted to creating products for the war effort, such as Ford Motor Company converting its plant to produce military jeeps. The company Hillerich &amp; Bradsby initially made baseball bats and then converted their production into making gunstocks.

During the war, there was a shortage of workers in the defense industry. African Americans took the opportunity to fill in the industries&#x27; missing jobs during the war, around 4.3 million intrastate migration and 2.1 million interstate migration in the Southern states. The defense industry in Louisville reached a peak of roughly over 80,000 employment. At first, job availability was not open for African Americans, but the growing need for jobs in the defense industry and the Fair Employment Practices Committee sign by Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Southern industries began to accept African Americans into the workplace.

Migration patterns reflected network ties. Black Americans tended to go to locations in the North where other Black Americans had previously migrated. Per a 2021 study, &quot;when one randomly chosen African American moved from a Southern birth town to a destination county, then 1.9 additional Black migrants made the same move on average.&quot;

== Cultural changes ==
After moving from the environment of the south to the northern states, African Americans were inspired to be creative in different ways. The Great Migration resulted in the Harlem Renaissance, which was also fueled by immigrants from the Caribbean, and the Chicago Black Renaissance. In her book &quot;The Warmth of Other Suns&quot;, Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson discusses the migration of &quot;six million Black Southerners [moving] out of the terror of Jim Crow to an uncertain existence in the North and Midwest.&quot;

The struggle of African-American migrants to adapt to Northern cities was the subject of Jacob Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Migration Series&quot; of paintings, created when he was a young man in New York. Exhibited in 1941 at the Museum of Modern Art, Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Series&quot; attracted wide attention; he was quickly perceived as one of the most important African-American artists of the time.

The Great Migration had effects on music as well as other cultural subjects. Many blues singers migrated from the Mississippi Delta to Chicago to escape racial discrimination. Muddy Waters, Chester Burnett, and Buddy Guy are among the most well-known blues artists who migrated to Chicago. Great Delta-born pianist Eddie Boyd told &quot;Living Blues&quot; magazine, &quot;I thought of coming to Chicago where I could get away from some of that racism and where I would have an opportunity to, well, do something with my talent... It wasn&#x27;t peaches and cream [in Chicago], man, but it was a hell of a lot better than down there where I was born.&quot;

== Effects ==

=== Demographic changes ===
The Great Migration drained off much of the rural Black population of the South, and for a time, froze or reduced African-American population growth in parts of the region. The migration changed the demographics in a number of states; there were decades of Black population decline, especially across the Deep South &quot;black belt&quot; where cotton had been the main cash crop but had been devastated by the arrival of the boll weevil. In 1910, African Americans constituted the majority of the population of South Carolina and Mississippi, and more than 40% in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas; by 1970, only in Mississippi did the African-American population constitute more than 30% of the state&#x27;s total. &quot;The disappearance of the &#x27;black belt&#x27; was one of the striking effects&quot; of the Great Migration, James Gregory wrote.

In Mississippi, the Black American population decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by 1970, remaining the majority only in some Delta counties. In Georgia, Black Americans decreased from about 45% of the population in 1910 to about 26% by 1970. In South Carolina, the Black population decreased from about 55% of the population in 1910 to about 30% by 1970.

The growing Black presence outside the South changed the dynamics and demographics of numerous cities in the Northeast, Midwest, and West. In 1900, only 740,000 African Americans lived outside the South, just 8% of the nation&#x27;s total Black population. By 1970, more than 10.6 million African Americans lived outside the South, 47% of the nation&#x27;s total.

Because the migrants concentrated in the big cities of the north and west, their influence was magnified in those places. Cities that had been virtually all white at the start of the century became centers of Black culture and politics by mid-century. Residential segregation and redlining led to concentrations of Black people in certain areas. The northern &quot;Black metropolises&quot; developed an important infrastructure of newspapers, businesses, jazz clubs, churches, and political organizations that provided the staging ground for new forms of racial politics and new forms of Black culture.

As a result of the Great Migration, the first large urban Black communities developed in northern cities beyond New York, Boston, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, which had Black communities even before the Civil War, and attracted migrants after the war. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 African Americans left the South in 1916 through 1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage in industrial cities during the First World War.

In 1910, the African-American population of Detroit was 6,000. The Great Migration, along with immigrants from southern and eastern Europe as well as their descendants, rapidly turned the city into the country&#x27;s fourth-largest. By the start of the Great Depression in 1929, the city&#x27;s African-American population had increased to 120,000.

In 1900–01, Chicago had a total population of 1,754,473. By 1920, the city had added more than 1 million residents. During the second wave of the Great Migration (1940–60), the African-American population in the city grew from 278,000 to 813,000.
The flow of African Americans to Ohio, particularly to Cleveland, changed the demographics of the state and its primary industrial city. Before the Great Migration, an estimated 1.1% to 1.6% of Cleveland&#x27;s population was African American. By 1920, 4.3% of Cleveland&#x27;s population was African American. The number of African Americans in Cleveland continued to rise over the next 20 years of the Great Migration.

Other northeastern and midwestern industrial cities, such as Philadelphia, New York City, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Omaha, also had dramatic increases in their African-American populations. By the 1920s, New York&#x27;s Harlem became a center of Black cultural life, influenced by the American migrants as well as new immigrants from the Caribbean area.

Second-tier industrial cities that were destinations for numerous Black migrants were Buffalo, Rochester, Boston, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Columbus, Cincinnati, Grand Rapids and Indianapolis, and smaller industrial cities such as Chester, Gary, Dayton, Erie, Toledo, Youngstown, Peoria, Muskegon, Newark, Flint, Saginaw, New Haven, and Albany. People tended to take the cheapest rail ticket possible and go to areas where they had relatives and friends.

For example, many people from Mississippi moved directly north by train to Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Louis, from Alabama to Cleveland and Detroit, from Georgia and South Carolina to New York City, Baltimore, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia, and in the second migration, from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to Oakland, Los Angeles, Portland, Phoenix, Denver, and Seattle.

=== Discrimination and working conditions ===
Educated African Americans were better able to obtain jobs after the Great Migration, eventually gaining a measure of class mobility, but the migrants encountered significant forms of discrimination. Because so many people migrated in a short period of time, the African-American migrants were often resented by the urban European-American working class (many of whom were recent immigrants themselves); fearing their ability to negotiate rates of pay or secure employment, the ethnic whites felt threatened by the influx of new labor competition. Sometimes those who were most fearful or resentful were the last immigrants of the 19th and new immigrants of the 20th century.

African Americans made substantial gains in industrial employment, particularly in the steel, automobile, shipbuilding, and meatpacking industries. Between 1910 and 1920, the number of Black workers employed in industry nearly doubled from 500,000 to 901,000. After the Great Depression, more advances took place after workers in the steel and meatpacking industries organized into labor unions in the 1930s and 1940s, under the interracial Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The unions ended the segregation of many jobs, and African Americans began to advance into more skilled jobs and supervisory positions previously informally reserved for whites.

Between 1940 and 1960, the number of Black people in managerial and administrative occupations doubled, along with the number of Black people in white-collar occupations, while the number of Black agricultural workers in 1960 fell to one-fourth of what it was in 1940. Also, between 1936 and 1959, Black income relative to white income more than doubled in various skilled trades. Despite employment discrimination, Black people had higher labor force participation rates than whites in every U.S. Census from 1890 to 1950. As a result of these advancements, the percentage of Black families living below the poverty line declined from 87% in 1940 to 47% by 1960 and to 30% by 1970.

Populations increased so rapidly among both African-American migrants and new European immigrants that there were housing shortages in most major cities. With fewer resources, the newer groups were forced to compete for the oldest, most run-down housing. Ethnic groups created territories which they defended against change. Discrimination often restricted African Americans to crowded neighborhoods. The more established populations of cities tended to move to newer housing as it was developing in the outskirts. Mortgage discrimination and redlining in inner city areas limited the newer African-American migrants&#x27; ability to determine their own housing, or obtain a fair price. In the long term, the National Housing Act of 1934 contributed to limiting the availability of loans to urban areas, particularly those areas inhabited by African Americans.

Migrants going to Albany, New York found poor living conditions and employment opportunities, but also higher wages and better schools and social services. Local organizations such as the Albany Inter-Racial Council and churches, helped them, but de facto segregation and discrimination remained well into the late 20th century.

Migrants going to Pittsburgh and surrounding mill towns in western Pennsylvania between 1890 and 1930 faced racial discrimination and limited economic opportunities. The Black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910. Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh&#x27;s Black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the Black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. Historian Joe Trotter explains the decision process:

Although African-Americans often expressed their views of the Great Migration in biblical terms and received encouragement from northern Black newspapers, railroad companies, and industrial labor agents, they also drew upon family and friendship networks to help in the move to Western Pennsylvania. They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process... In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, Black people who lived in the South discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.

=== Integration and segregation ===
In cities such as Newark, New York and Chicago, African Americans became increasingly integrated into society. As they lived and worked more closely with European Americans, the divide became increasingly indefinite. This period marked the transition for many African Americans from lifestyles as rural farmers to urban industrial workers.

This migration gave birth to a cultural boom in cities such as Chicago and New York. In Chicago for instance, the neighborhood of Bronzeville became known as the &quot;Black Metropolis&quot;. From 1924 to 1929, the &quot;Black Metropolis&quot; was at the peak of its golden years. Many of the community&#x27;s entrepreneurs were Black during this period. &quot;The foundation of the first African American YMCA took place in Bronzeville, and worked to help incoming migrants find jobs in the city of Chicago.&quot;

The &quot;Black Belt&quot; geographical and racial isolation of this community, bordered to the north and east by whites, and to the south and west by industrial sites and ethnic immigrant neighborhoods, made it a site for the study of the development of an urban Black community. For urbanized people, eating proper foods in a sanitary, civilized setting such as the home or a restaurant was a social ritual that indicated one&#x27;s level of respectability. The people native to Chicago had pride in the high level of integration in Chicago restaurants, which they attributed to their unassailable manners and refined tastes.

Since African-American migrants retained many Southern cultural and linguistic traits, such cultural differences created a sense of &quot;otherness&quot; in terms of their reception by others who were already living in the cities. Stereotypes ascribed to Black people during this period and ensuing generations often derived from African-American migrants&#x27; rural cultural traditions, which were maintained in stark contrast to the urban environments in which the people resided.

Locals started building Black-owned establishments like bars, hotels, and churches. The Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church was one of these establishments. Soloman and Cordelia Johnson founded the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in the late 1890s. Black locals were able to freely express their religious beliefs in this church, which developed into a cultural center. The Hotel Robinson was another popular institution. It was established by Albert and Margaret Robinson after gaining their freedom from slavery. They built and opened The Hotel Robinson in Julian in 1887. This hotel is still currently active and is now known as the Julian Hotel. It&#x27;s the first Black-owned business in San Diego and the oldest operating hotel in Southern California.

== White southern reaction ==
The beginning of the Great Migration exposed a paradox in race relations in the American South at that time. Although Black people were treated with extreme hostility and subjected to legal discrimination, the southern economy was deeply dependent on them as an abundant supply of cheap labor, and Black workers were seen as the most critical factor in the economic development of the South. One South Carolina politician summed up the dilemma: &quot;Politically speaking, there are far too many negroes, but from an industrial standpoint there is room for many more.&quot;

When the Great Migration started in the 1910s, white southern elites seemed to be unconcerned, and industrialists and cotton planters saw it as a positive, as it was siphoning off surplus industrial and agricultural labor. As the migration picked up, however, southern elites began to panic, fearing that a prolonged Black exodus would bankrupt the South, and newspaper editorials warned of the danger. White employers eventually took notice and began expressing their fears. White southerners soon began trying to stem the flow in order to prevent the hemorrhaging of their labor supply, and some even began attempting to address the poor living standards and racial oppression experienced by Southern Black people in order to induce them to stay.

As a result, southern employers increased their wages to match those on offer in the North, and some individual employers even opposed the worst excesses of Jim Crow laws. When the measures failed to stem the tide, white southerners, in concert with federal officials who feared the rise of Black nationalism, co-operated in attempting to coerce Black people to stay in the South. The Southern Metal Trades Association urged decisive action to stop Black migration, and some employers undertook serious efforts against it.

The largest southern steel manufacturer refused to cash checks sent to finance Black migration, efforts were made to restrict bus and train access for Black Americans, agents were stationed in northern cities to report on wage levels, unionization, and the rise of Black nationalism, and newspapers were pressured to divert more coverage to negative aspects of Black life in the North. A series of local and federal directives were put into place with the goal of restricting Black mobility, including local vagrancy ordinances, &quot;work or fight&quot; laws demanding all males either be employed or serve in the army, and conscription orders. Intimidation and beatings were also used to terrorize Black people into staying. These intimidation tactics were described by Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson as interfering with &quot;the natural right of workers to move from place to place at their own discretion&quot;.

During the wave of migration that took place in the 1940s, white southerners were less concerned, as mechanization of agriculture in the late 1930s had resulted in another labor surplus so southern planters put up less resistance.

Black Americans were not the only group to leave the South for Northern industrial opportunities. Large numbers of poor whites from Appalachia and the Upland South made the journey to the Midwest and Northeast after World War II, a phenomenon known as the Hillbilly Highway.

== In popular culture ==
The Great Migration is a backdrop of the 2013 film &quot;The Butler&quot;, as the Forest Whitaker character Cecil Gaines moves from a plantation in Georgia to become a butler at the White House. The Great Migration also served as part of August Wilson’s inspiration for &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;.

==New Great Migration==

After the political and civil gains of the Civil Rights Movement, in the 1970s, migration began to increase again. It moved in a different direction, as Black people who were searching for economic opportunity traveled to new regions of the South.

The New Great Migration is not evenly distributed throughout the South. As with the earlier Great Migration, the New Great Migration is primarily directed toward cities and large urban areas, such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Dallas, Raleigh, Washington, D.C., Tampa, Virginia Beach, San Antonio, Memphis, Orlando, Nashville, Jacksonville, and so forth. North Carolina&#x27;s Charlotte metro area in particular, is a hot spot for African-American migrants in the US. Between 1975 and 1980, Charlotte saw a net gain of 2,725 African Americans in the area. This number continued to rise as between 1985 and 1990 as the area had a net gain of 7,497 African Americans, and from 1995 to 2000 the net gain was 23,313 African Americans. This rise in net gain points to Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, and Houston being a growing hot spots for the migrants of The New Great Migration. The percentage of Black Americans who live in the South has been increasing since 1990, and the biggest gains have been in the region&#x27;s large urban areas, according to census data. The Black population of metro Atlanta more than doubled between 1990 and 2020, surpassing 2 million in the most recent census. The Black population also more than doubled in metro Charlotte while Greater Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth both saw their Black populations surpass 1 million for the first time. Several smaller metro areas also saw sizable gains, including San Antonio; Raleigh and Greensboro, N.C.; and Orlando. Primary destinations are states that have the most job opportunities, especially Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, Florida and Texas. Other southern states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama and Arkansas, have seen little net growth in the African-American population from return migration.

<doc id="375542" wikidata="Q627719" url="?curid=375542" title="2003 Heritage Classic">
<text>The Heritage Classic was an outdoor ice hockey game played on November 22, 2003, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, between the Edmonton Oilers and the Montreal Canadiens. It was the first National Hockey League (NHL) game to be played outdoors as a part of regular season play. The Heritage Classic concept was modelled after the success of the &quot;Cold War&quot; game between the University of Michigan and Michigan State University in 2001.

The event took place in Edmonton&#x27;s Commonwealth Stadium in front of a crowd of 57,167, despite temperatures of close to −30 °C (−22 °F) with wind chill. It was held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Edmonton Oilers joining the NHL in 1979 and the 20th anniversary of their first Stanley Cup win in 1984. The CBC television broadcast drew 2.747 million viewers in Canada, the second-highest audience for a regular-season NHL game. This was the first NHL game broadcast in HD on CBC.

==Preliminary events==
First, the &quot;MegaStars&quot; game was played between some of the best former players from both clubs. The Oilers were represented by the best players from their 1980s dynasty, led by Wayne Gretzky. The Canadiens were represented by players from their 1970s dynasty, led by Guy Lafleur, and a few members of the 1986 and 1993 championship squads. Both teams were composed of players who had won Stanley Cups with the Oilers or Canadiens, except for the Oilers&#x27; first NHL captain, Ron Chipperfield, and the Canadiens&#x27; Russ Courtnall, who Rejean Houle said was selected for his speed. Cam Connor and Mark Napier were the only players that played for both the Oilers and the Canadiens during their NHL careers; both played for the Canadiens during the game. Mark Messier, the only active player at the time, received special permission from the New York Rangers front office to compete for Edmonton in the game. The &quot;MegaStars&quot; game consisted of two 15-minute halves rather than three 20-minute periods, and was won by the Oilers by a score of 2–0. After the game, Messier jokingly called the low-scoring contest &quot;a typical Oilers win,&quot; a reference to the numerous high-scoring games of the Oilers&#x27; heyday in the 1980s.

==Regular season game==
The second game was an official NHL regular season contest between the Edmonton Oilers and the Montreal Canadiens. Montreal won the game 4–3. Richard Zednik of the Canadiens scored the first goal of the game, and also scored the game-winner. Goaltender Jose Theodore wore a Canadiens tuque over the top of his goalie mask.

The game was released to DVD by the CBC, and included special features such as player interviews.

==Inspiration for ongoing outdoor games==
The first NHL game to be played outdoors was a pre-season exhibition game on September 27, 1991, when the Los Angeles Kings played the New York Rangers outside Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

Following the success of the 2003 Heritage Classic, the league moved forward with the periodic NHL Heritage Classic series, whichas of the 2023 Heritage Classic (in Edmonton, to mark the 20th anniversary of the original)have each been hosted by a Canadian NHL team, at a venue in or near the host team&#x27;s city.

In 2008, the league began the NHL Winter Classic series, an outdoor regular season game played annually on New Year&#x27;s Day, which to date have all been hosted by an American NHL team, at a venue in or near the host team&#x27;s city.

In 2014, the league instigated the semi-regular NHL Stadium Series, an outdoor regular season game, which to date have all been hosted by an American NHL team, at a venue in or near the host team&#x27;s city.

== Game summary ==
:&quot;Number in parentheses represents the player&#x27;s total in goals or assists to that point of the season&quot;

==Entertainment==
During the pre-game ceremony, Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s daughter Paulina Gretzky performed &quot;I Will Remember You&quot; by Sarah McLachlan while Oilers anthem singer Paul Lorieau performed &quot;O Canada&quot; in English and French.

== Team rosters ==

<text>The Worshipful Company of Distillers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. The Distillers&#x27; Company was incorporated under a Royal Charter in 1638 as proposed by Thomas Cademan and Theodore de Mayerne, physicians to Queen Henrietta Maria. It was empowered to regulate and supervise the production of spirits and liquors. Nowadays, the Company no longer exercises such powers but focuses on charitable distributions, including educational scholarships and bursaries.

The Distillers&#x27; Company ranks sixty-ninth in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies and its membership, comprising executives from the drinks industry and those whose families were involved in the distilling business, enjoys an active social life.

A short history of the Company by Michael Berlin was published in 1996, and its heraldic motto is Drop as Rain, Distil as Dew.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Pattenmakers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. The Pattenmakers, who were incorporated by royal charter in 1670 and granted livery status in 1717, were makers of wooden-soled overshoes. Pattens in previous times were helpful to pedestrians negotiating the muddy streets of London. However, with the advent of paved streets and rubber galoshes, pattens became obsolete by the end of the 19th century. Thus, the company&#x27;s main function is now as a charitable body rather than a guild or trade association for pattenmakers.

The Pattenmakers&#x27; Company ranks seventieth in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Recipiunt Fœminæ Sustentacula Nobis&quot;, Latin for &quot;Women Receive Support From Us&quot;.

Since the 15th century, the Pattenmakers have been affiliated with St Margaret Pattens, a Wren church located in Eastcheap.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers (Glass Sellers&#x27; Company) is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The company received its royal charter from King Charles II in 1664. Its role was to regulate the glass selling and pot-making industries within the City of London, and to ensure quality and fair trade. Aspiring traders in glass were apprenticed to a master who was a member of the Glass Sellers Company. He in turn was accountable to the court and officers of the livery and ultimately to the master of the company.

Today the role of the company is to stimulate interest in the many and varied aspects of glass and carry out charitable works, with special emphasis on education.

Representatives of almost all the sectors of the modern glass industry are members of the livery. These include the manufacture and sale of container glass, medical glass, art glass and the telecommunications, media and technology sector.

== History ==

The Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers of London ranks 71st in precedence among the City of London&#x27;s livery companies and received its incorporated royal charter in 1664. This, together with an earlier charter dated 1635 which was not incorporated by the Court of Aldermen, for reasons which are now obscure, are both still held by the company. The 1630s were troubled times and problems in the glass trade periodically collided with a background of political unrest.
Within the City of London there already were livery companies controlling the manufacture and quality of glazing for windows and spectacle manufacture; and the new Glass Sellers Company was therefore established to cover all other parts of the glass trade. It was to be responsible not only for the production of drinking vessels and tableware, but also for the manufacture of looking-glasses and glass vials – such as those then used in the making of hour glasses.
The main task of the new company, all of whose members were previously members of other London companies, was dominated by retailers – often those working with china, which was then imported from China in large-scale lots for sale to retailers at auction.

== Charitable activities ==

The Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers Charity Fund supports the wider glass industry through its awards, provides scholarships and bursaries for education, and supports the City and its specific appeals and the less privileged in and around the City of London.

=== The Glass Sellers&#x27; Art &amp; Craft Award ===

Working under the patronage of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers, George Ravenscroft made his famous discovery of lead crystal. Its manufacture subsequently began in 1674 at his workshop which is on the site now occupied by the Savoy Hotel in the Strand. Since then the Glass Sellers Company has continued, in various ways to support the art of glassmaking, consolidating this in the main, in two awards for glass art. The Glass Sellers Prize used to be an annual award but since 2008, it has been linked to the British Glass Biennale and is awarded biennially.
