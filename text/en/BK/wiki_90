<text>A torsion bar suspension, also known as a torsion spring suspension, is any vehicle suspension that uses a torsion bar as its main weight-bearing spring. One end of a long metal bar is attached firmly to the vehicle chassis; the opposite end terminates in a lever, the torsion key, mounted perpendicular to the bar, that is attached to a suspension arm, a spindle, or the axle. Vertical motion of the wheel causes the bar to twist around its axis and is resisted by the bar&#x27;s torsion resistance. The effective spring rate of the bar is determined by its length, cross section, shape, material, and manufacturing process.

==Usage==
Torsion bar suspensions are used on combat vehicles and tanks like the T-72, Leopard 1, Leopard 2, M26 Pershing, M18 Hellcat, M48 Patton, M60 Patton and the M1 Abrams (many tanks from World War II used this suspension), and on modern trucks and SUVs from Ford, Chrysler, GM, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan, Isuzu, LuAZ, and Toyota. Class 8 truck manufacturer Kenworth also offered a torsion bar suspension for its K100C and W900A models, up to about 1981.

Manufacturers change the torsion bar or key to adjust the ride height, usually to compensate for engine weight.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The main advantages of a torsion bar suspension are soft ride due to elasticity of the bar, durability, easy adjustability of ride height, and small profile along the width of the vehicle. It takes up less of the vehicle&#x27;s interior volume than coil springs.

Torsion bars reached the height of their popularity on mass-production road cars in the middle of the 20th century at the same time that unitary construction was being adopted. At a time when the mechanics of stress and metal fatigue in unitary body frames was poorly understood, torsion bars were very attractive to vehicle designers as the bars could be mounted to reinforced parts of the central structure, typically the bulkhead. Using MacPherson struts to achieve independent front suspension with coil springs meant providing strong turrets in the frontal structure of the car.

A disadvantage is that torsion bars, unlike coil springs, usually cannot provide a progressive spring rate. In most torsion bar systems, ride height (and therefore many handling features) may be changed by simply adjusting bolts that connect the torsion bars to the frame cross member. In most cars with this type of suspension, swapping torsion bars for a different spring rate is usually an easy task. Longitudinal torsion bars extend under the passenger compartment, cutting into interior space by raising the floor, while in transverse systems, torsion bar length is limited by vehicle width.

==Leveling==
Some vehicles use torsion bars to provide automatic leveling, using a motor to pre-stress the bars to provide greater resistance to load and, in some cases (depending on the speed with which the motors can act), to respond to changes in road conditions. Height adjustable suspension has been used to implement a wheel-change mode where the vehicle is raised on three wheels so that the remaining wheel is lifted off the ground without the aid of a jack. This example is of a vehicle that uses oleopneumatic suspension where a high pressure pump primes a pressure reservoir that feeds terminating spheres with hydraulic oil (LHM) to achieve suspension. The ride height is maintained by cross-linking front and rear suspension spheres using hydraulic connecting pipes. (The two previous sentences refer to two different oleo-pneumatic suspension systems and are best ignored in the context of torsion bars. The principle of wheel change by suspension height adjustments has already been explained earlier in the paragraph).

==History==
The first vehicle to use torsion bars was Leyland Eight designed by J. G. Parry-Thomas and produced from 1920 to 1923, however its rear suspension, patented in 1919, was retrospectively named &quot;torsion bar assisted&quot; by Leyland in a 1966 publication because the bars only complemented the leaf springs. Less than two dozen cars (including racing variants) were produced, and the suspension was only ever used again on Marlborough-Thomas racing cars few years later.

In 1923 Parry-Thomas patented an updated design featuring a true torsion bar design with no leaf springs, however the inventor&#x27;s death in a car crash in 1927 prevented its further development. Therefore the invention is often credited to the Porsche GmbH, which patented it in 1931 and later used in a lot of designs.

The front wheel drive Citroën Traction Avant from 1934 was the first to implement the idea in a serially produced car, featuring independent front torsion bar suspension and a flexible trailing dead axle, also sprung by torsion bars. The flexibility of the axle beam provided wheel location features like a twist beam axle. Also in the 1930s, Porsche&#x27;s prototypes of the first Volkswagen Beetle incorporated torsion bars—especially their transverse mounting style. Czechoslovakian Tatra&#x27;s 1948 T600 Tatraplan employed rear torsion bar suspension, the only Tatra to do so.

The system first saw military use in the Swedish Stridsvagn L-60 tank of 1934. Its suspension was developed by German engineers, including Porsche employee Karl Rabe who also held patents on torsion bar suspensions personally.

It was used extensively in European cars like Renault, Citroën and Porsche/Volkswagen, by less known producers like Mathis and Röhr in the 1930s, as well as by American Packard in the 1950s. The Packard used torsion bars at both front and rear, and interconnected the front and rear systems to improve ride quality. Morris Minor and Oxford from the late 1940s onwards used a front torsion bar system very similar to the Citroën, as did the Riley RM models. The revolutionary Jaguar E-Type introduced in 1961 had a torsion bar front suspension very similar to the Citroën and Morris Minor, and an independent coil spring rear suspension using four shock absorbers with concentric springs (coilover).

An early application of a torsion bar in an American car was by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit who had introduced the innovative front axle flex suspension in 1934 Hudson and Terraplane cars and realized for 1935 that a transverse torsion bar linked to the rear axle was needed as an anti-roll bar to stabilize the cars. The single torsion bar was mounted through the frame sides behind the rear axle and then attached by arms and links to the front side of the spring U-bolt plates. Axle flex was discontinued for the 1936 model year.

Gladeon M. Barnes and Warren E. Preston filed a US patent application for a torsion bar suspension in 1934, which was approved two years later. The original feature of the patent was what is now called tube-over-bar (TOB) design which only saw limited use in the 1960s (for example, on LVTP-7). Even though Barnes was employed by the US Army Ordnance Department, torsion bars were not used in American armor designs until the T70 GMC in 1943, which suspension was derived from Pz. III by GM engineer Robert Schilling.

Post-war the use of torsion bar front suspension was a defining feature of British Morris cars, starting with the Morris Minor of 1948, its larger Morris Oxford MO counterpart and the upmarket Morris Six MS, plus the Wolseley-badged upmarket variants of the latter two models. The designer of these cars, Alec Issigonis, was inspired by the Traction Avant&#x27;s suspension, although the Morris cars were rear-wheel drive and used conventional leaf springs for their rear axles. The Minor used lever arm dampers with its torsion bars while the Oxford and the Six used innovative telescopic dampers. The Minor remained in production largely unchanged until 1972 and was replaced by the Morris Marina which also used the torsion bar-lever arm damper system for its front suspension—one of the last new cars worldwide to be introduced with the system and which remained in production until 1984. The Oxford/Six platform was developed through several revised series which used Issigonis&#x27; torsion bar system until 1959 when the new Farina Oxford was introduced using front suspension with coil springs, lower wishbones and lever arm dampers.

The most famous American passenger car application of the torsion bar, was the Chrysler system used beginning with all Chrysler products starting with the 1957 model year in cars such as the Imperial Crown series, Chrysler Windsor, DeSoto Firedome, Dodge Coronet and Plymouth Belevedere although Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;Torsion-Air&quot; suspension was only for the front axle; the same basic system (longitudinal mounting) was maintained until the 1981 introduction of the K-car. A reengineered torsion bar suspension, introduced with the 1976 Dodge Aspen, introduced transverse-mounted torsion bars (possibly based on the Volkswagen Type 3 passenger car) until production ended in 1989 (with Chrysler&#x27;s M platform). Some generations of the Dodge Dakota and Durango used torsion bars on the front suspension.

General Motors first used torsion bars on their light-duty pickup trucks in 1960 until it was phased out in 1963 where traditional coil springs are used up front for their 2WD trucks. Its first use in a passenger car was in 1966, starting with the E-platform vehicles (Oldsmobile Toronado, Cadillac Eldorado), 4WD S-10 pickups and Astro vans with optional AWD, and since 1988, full size trucks and SUVs with 4WD (GMT400, GMT800, and GMT900 series).

Porsche used four-wheel torsion bar suspension for their 356 and 911 series from 1948 until 1989 with the introduction of the 964. They are also used in the front suspension of the 914 as well as the rear suspension of the 924, 944, and 968. Honda also used front torsion bars on the third generation Civic and other variants built on the same platform including the Ballade and first generation CRX.

==Variations==
The German World War II Panther tank had double torsion bars. Needing bars longer than the width of the tank to get the required spring rate and maximum elastic bend angle from available steel alloys, designer Ernst Lehr created a suspension that effectively folded the bars in half. For each wheel, one rod was attached to the suspension arm, while another was mounted to a nearby point on the frame. On the opposite side of the tank, the two rods were attached to each other and fitted into a pivot. Deflection of the suspension arm caused both halves of the double torsion bar to twist. A disadvantage of the torsion bar suspension used in Tiger and Panther tanks (and many other WWII-era tanks and other AFVs) was the inability to incorporate an escape hatch through the bottom of the hull, a common feature of WWII-era tanks, as the torsion bar arrangement would have blocked crew access to such a hatch; however, the absence of leaf, coil or volute springs often left a large expanse of the side of the hull clear to include a side-escape hatch, and it was rare for a tank to be flipped over in such a way that all top-side hatches were unable to open, which is the purpose of ventral hatches.

Many contemporary main battle tanks use torsion bar suspension, including the American M1 Abrams, German Leopard 2, and Chinese MBT-3000, though the newest generation of tanks such as the Russian T-14 Armata utilize an adjustable hydraulic suspension. Due to their small size, tremendous load capacity, and relative ease of service, torsion bar suspension has been ideal for tanks, though it is not without disadvantage. The large travel and high elasticity of the torsion bars results in a &quot;rocking&quot; motion when the tank is moving or coming to a sudden stop. A gun stabilizer must be used to compensate for the rocking motion. Due to the massive weight of a main battle tank, compared to an automobile, there is a much greater risk of breaking a torsion bar on sudden bumps or maneuvers, and if it is not replaced in short order the reduced suspension can affect the maneuverability of the vehicle, and in extreme cases risk immobilizing the vehicle as the reduced capacity of the suspension causes additional torsion bars to break.

==Other uses==
Torsion bars were sometimes used instead of conventional coil valve springs in some older motorcycles, such as the Honda CB450, and also on the Panhard Dyna X and Panhard Dyna Z cars of the 1950s. They were also used in the door mechanism of the DMC DeLorean automobile and trunk lids of some Toyota Corolla (E30) models.

<doc id="391267" wikidata="Q1357356" url="?curid=391267" title="Positron emission">
<text>Positron emission, beta plus decay, or β+ decay is a subtype of radioactive decay called beta decay, in which a proton inside a radionuclide nucleus is converted into a neutron while releasing a positron and an electron neutrino (). Positron emission is mediated by the weak force. The positron is a type of beta particle (β+), the other beta particle being the electron (β−) emitted from the β− decay of a nucleus.

An example of positron emission (β+ decay) is shown with magnesium-23 decaying into sodium-23:

Because positron emission decreases proton number relative to neutron number, positron decay happens typically in large &quot;proton-rich&quot; radionuclides. Positron decay results in nuclear transmutation, changing an atom of one chemical element into an atom of an element with an atomic number that is less by one unit.

Positron emission occurs extremely rarely in nature on Earth. Known instances include cosmic ray interactions and the decay of certain isotopes, such as potassium-40. This rare form of potassium makes up only 0.012% of the element on Earth and has a 1 in 100,000 chance of decaying via positron emission.

Positron emission should not be confused with electron emission or beta minus decay (β− decay), which occurs when a neutron turns into a proton and the nucleus emits an electron and an antineutrino.

Positron emission is different from proton decay, the hypothetical decay of protons, not necessarily those bound with neutrons, not necessarily through the emission of a positron, and not as part of nuclear physics, but rather of particle physics.

==Discovery of positron emission==
In 1934 Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie bombarded aluminium with alpha particles (emitted by polonium) to effect the nuclear reaction  +  →  + , and observed that the product isotope emits a positron identical to those found in cosmic rays by Carl David Anderson in 1932. This was the first example of  decay (positron emission). The Curies termed the phenomenon &quot;artificial radioactivity&quot;, because is a short-lived nuclide which does not exist in nature. The discovery of artificial radioactivity would be cited when the husband-and-wife team won the Nobel Prize.

==Positron-emitting isotopes==
Isotopes which undergo this decay and thereby emit positrons include, but are not limited to: carbon-11, nitrogen-13, oxygen-15, fluorine-18, copper-64, gallium-68, bromine-78, rubidium-82, yttrium-86, zirconium-89, sodium-22, aluminium-26, potassium-40, strontium-83, and iodine-124. As an example, the following equation describes the beta plus decay of carbon-11 to boron-11, emitting a positron and a neutrino:

==Emission mechanism==
Inside protons and neutrons, there are fundamental particles called quarks. The two most common types of quarks are &quot;up quarks&quot;, which have a charge of +, and &quot;down quarks&quot;, with a − charge. Quarks arrange themselves in sets of three such that they make protons and neutrons. In a proton, whose charge is +1, there are two &quot;up&quot; quarks and one &quot;down&quot; quark ( + − = 1). Neutrons, with no charge, have one &quot;up&quot; quark and two &quot;down&quot; quarks ( − − = 0). Via the weak interaction, quarks can change flavor from &quot;down&quot; to &quot;up&quot;, resulting in electron emission. Positron emission happens when an &quot;up&quot; quark changes into a &quot;down&quot; quark, effectively converting a proton to a neutron.

Nuclei which decay by positron emission may also decay by electron capture. For low-energy decays, electron capture is energetically favored by 2&quot;m&quot;e&quot;c&quot;2 = , since the final state has an electron removed rather than a positron added. As the energy of the decay goes up, so does the branching fraction of positron emission. However, if the energy difference is less than 2&quot;m&quot;e&quot;c&quot;2, the positron emission cannot occur and electron capture is the sole decay mode. Certain otherwise electron-capturing isotopes (for instance, ) are stable in galactic cosmic rays, because the electrons are stripped away and the decay energy is too small for positron emission.

==Energy conservation==
A positron is ejected from the parent nucleus, but the daughter (Z−1) atom still has Z atomic electrons from the parent, i.e. the daughter is a negative ion (at least immediately after the positron emission). Since tables of masses are for &quot;atomic&quot; masses, 
formula_1
, and, since the mass of the positron is identical to that of the electron, the overall result is that the mass-energy of &quot;two&quot; electrons is required, and the β+ decay is energetically possible if and only if the mass of the parent atom exceeds the mass of the daughter atom by at least two electron masses (2&quot;m&quot;e c2 = 1.022 MeV).

Isotopes which increase in mass under the conversion of a proton to a neutron, or which decrease in mass by less than 2&quot;m&quot;e, cannot spontaneously decay by positron emission.

==Application==
These isotopes are used in positron emission tomography, a technique used for medical imaging. The energy emitted depends on the isotope that is decaying; the figure of applies only to the decay of carbon-11.

The short-lived positron emitting isotopes 11C (T = ), 13N (T = ), 15O (T = ), and 18F (T = ) used for positron emission tomography are typically produced by proton or deuteron irradiation of natural or enriched targets.

<text>The Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism is located in Pulitzer Hall on the university&#x27;s Morningside Heights campus in New York City. Founded in 1912 by Joseph Pulitzer, Columbia Journalism School is one of the oldest journalism schools in the world and the only journalism school in the Ivy League. It offers four graduate degree programs.

The school shares facilities with the Pulitzer Prizes. It directly administers several other prizes, including the Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award, honoring excellence in broadcast and digital journalism in the public service. It co-sponsors the National Magazine Awards, also known as the Ellie Awards, and publishes the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;.

In addition to offering professional development programs, fellowships and workshops, the school is home to the Tow Center for Digital Journalism, the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, and the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma.

Admission to the school is highly selective and has traditionally drawn an international student body. A Board of Visitors meets periodically to advise the dean&#x27;s office and support the school&#x27;s initiatives.

==History==
===Pulitzer School of Journalism===

In 1892, Joseph Pulitzer, a Hungarian-born newspaper magnate, offered Columbia University President Seth Low funding to establish the world&#x27;s first school of journalism. He sought to elevate a profession viewed more often as a common trade learned through an apprenticeship. His idea was for a center of enlightened journalism in pursuit of knowledge as well as skills in the service of democracy. &quot;It will impart knowledge—not for its own sake, but to be used for the public service,&quot; Pulitzer wrote in a now landmark, lead essay of the May 1904 issue of the &quot;North American Review&quot;. The university was resistant to the idea. But Low&#x27;s successor, Nicholas Murray Butler, was more receptive to the plan.

Pulitzer was set on creating his vision at Columbia and offered it a $2 million gift, one-quarter of which was to be used to establish prizes in journalism and the arts. It took years of negotiations and Pulitzer&#x27;s death in October 1911 to finalize plans. On September 30, 1912, classes began with 79 undergraduate and postgraduate students, including a dozen women. Veteran journalist Talcott Williams was installed as the school&#x27;s director. When not attending classes and lectures, students scoured the city for news. Their more advanced classmates were assigned to cover a visit by U.S. President William Howard Taft, a sensational police murder trial and a women&#x27;s suffrage march. A student from China went undercover to report on a downtown cocaine den. A journalism building was constructed the following year at 2950 Broadway and 116th Street on the western end of the campus. A statue of Thomas Jefferson was installed in June 1914 as a symbol of &quot;free inquiry&quot; exemplified by the debates between him and fellow American founder and Columbia alumnus, Alexander Hamilton, a statute of whom was unveiled directly across campus in front of Hamilton Hall six years earlier.

=== First journalism graduate school ===
In 1935, Dean Carl Ackerman, a 1913 alumnus, led the school&#x27;s transition to become the first graduate school of journalism in the United States. As the school&#x27;s reach and reputation spread (due in part to an adjunct faculty of working New York journalists and a tenured full-time faculty that included Pulitzer winners Douglas Southall Freeman and Henry F. Pringle and &quot;Life Begins at Forty&quot; author Walter B. Pitkin), it began offering coursework in television news and documentary filmmaking in addition to its focus on newspapers and radio. The Maria Moors Cabot Prizes, the oldest international awards in journalism, were founded in 1938, honoring reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean. The Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism moved to the school in 1968. In 1958, the Columbia Journalism Award, the school&#x27;s highest honor, was established to recognize a person of overarching accomplishment and distinguished service to journalism. Three years later, the school began publishing the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;.
After joining the tenured faculty in 1950, veteran United Nations correspondent John Hohenberg became the inaugural administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes in 1954, a secondary appointment that he would hold until 1976. Ackerman was succeeded as dean in 1954 by former Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs Edward W. Barrett, who served until 1968. In 1966, the school began awarding the National Magazine Awards in association with the American Society of Magazine Editors. Former CBS News president Fred W. Friendly was appointed the same year to the tenured faculty and enhanced the broadcast journalism program alongside former NBC News correspondent Elie Abel, who served as dean from 1970 to 1979. Abel was succeeded by former &quot;Newsweek&quot; editor and prominent New York socialite Osborn Elliott (1979–1986), who in turn was succeeded by longtime Bill Moyers collaborator Joan Konner (1988–1996), the school&#x27;s only female dean to date. By the 1970s, the Reporting and Writing 1 (RW1) course had become the cornerstone of the school&#x27;s basic curriculum. The Knight‐Bagehot Fellowship was created in 1975 to enrich economics and business journalism. In 1985, the Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism was founded. While serving as Pulitzer administrator, former &quot;The New York Times&quot; managing editor Seymour Topping joined the tenured faculty in 1994.

A doctoral program was established in 1998 by communications theorist James W. Carey, who emerged as an &quot;editor of and contributor to many scholarly publications at a time when Columbia was urging journalism professors to do more academic research.&quot; In 2005, Nicholas Lemann, two years into his tenure as dean, created a second more specialized master&#x27;s program leading to a master of arts degree, prompting the hiring of political journalist Thomas B. Edsall and music critic David Hajdu. As a result of industry changes forced by digital media, the school in 2013 erased distinctions between types of media, such as newspaper, broadcast, magazine and new media, as specializations in its master of science curriculum. The Toni Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism, dedicated to training select students interested in pursuing careers in investigative journalism, opened in 2006. A year later, the Spencer Fellowship was created to focus on long-form reporting. The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma relocated to Columbia in 2009 to focus on media coverage of trauma, conflict and tragedy. In 2010, the Tow Center for Digital Journalism was created. The Brown Institute for Media Innovation was launched under the aegis of former Bell Labs statistician and data scientist Mark Henry Hansen in 2012.

==Academic programs==

The school&#x27;s ten-month Master of Science (M.S.) program offers aspiring and experienced journalists the opportunity to study the skills, art and ethics of journalism by reporting and writing stories that range from short news pieces to complex narrative features. Some students interested in investigative reporting are selected to study at the Stabile Center for Investigative Journalism, a specialization of the M.S. program. Documentary and data journalism specialization programs are offered as well. The M.S. program is also offered on a part-time basis.

A year-long M.S. program in data journalism teaches the skills for finding, collecting and analyzing data for storytelling, presentation and investigative reporting.

The school offers several dual-degree programs in collaboration with other schools at Columbia: journalism and computer science, journalism and international affairs, journalism and law, journalism and business, and journalism and religion. The school also offers international dual-degree programs with Sciences Po in Paris, France and the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa.

The smaller and more specialized, nine-month Master of Arts (M.A.) program is for experienced journalists interested in focusing on a particular subject area: politics, science, business and economics or arts and culture. M.A. students work closely with journalism professors and take courses in other academic departments and schools at the university. The program is full-time.

The doctoral program draws upon the resources of Columbia in a multidisciplinary approach to the study of communications. Ph.D. students craft individual courses of study to acquire deep knowledge in an area of concentration through research and coursework in disciplines ranging from history, sociology or religion to business or international affairs.

A six-week graduate-level course on book, magazine, and digital publishing, known as the Columbia Publishing Course, has been offered since 2000, when the program transferred from Radcliffe College.

==&quot;The Bronx Beat&quot;==
&quot;The Bronx Beat&quot;, established in 1981 and published Mondays, is the weekly student publication of Columbia Journalism School. 

==&quot;Uptown Radio&quot;==
&quot;Uptown Radio&quot; is a weekly news magazine and podcast modeled after NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. It is produced by the students of the Radio Workshop, an advanced audio course at Columbia Journalism School. Uptown Radio is the school&#x27;s longest-running continuous webcast, broadcasting each Thursday at 4 pm, from February through May, since 1996. Uptown Radio contains original feature reports as well as interviews and newscasts in service of the listeners in New York City and the world beyond. 

==Journalism awards==
The Columbia Journalism School directly administers the Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award, the Maria Moors Cabot Prizes, the John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism, the Lukas Prizes, the Oakes Prizes, the Meyer Berger Award, the Paul Tobenkin Memorial Award and the Dart Awards for Excellence in Coverage of Trauma. It also co-sponsors the National Magazine Awards with the American Society of Magazine Editors, which administers the program.

==Accreditation==
Columbia Journalism School is accredited by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

<text>Proton emission (also known as proton radioactivity) is a rare type of radioactive decay in which a proton is ejected from a nucleus. Proton emission can occur from high-lying excited states in a nucleus following a beta decay, in which case the process is known as beta-delayed proton emission, or can occur from the ground state (or a low-lying isomer) of very proton-rich nuclei, in which case the process is very similar to alpha decay. For a proton to escape a nucleus, the proton separation energy must be negative (Sp &lt; 0)—the proton is therefore unbound, and tunnels out of the nucleus in a finite time. The rate of proton emission is governed by the nuclear, Coulomb, and centrifugal potentials of the nucleus, where centrifugal potential affects a large part of the rate of proton emission. The half-life of a nucleus with respect to proton emission is affected by the proton energy and its orbital angular momentum. Proton emission is not seen in naturally occurring isotopes; proton emitters can be produced via nuclear reactions, usually using linear particle accelerators.

Although prompt (i.e. not beta-delayed) proton emission was observed from an isomer in cobalt-53 as early as 1969, no other proton-emitting states were found until 1981, when the proton radioactive ground states of lutetium-151 and thulium-147 were observed at experiments at the GSI in West Germany. Research in the field flourished after this breakthrough, and to date more than 25 isotopes have been found to exhibit proton emission. The study of proton emission has aided the understanding of nuclear deformation, masses, and structure, and it is a pure example of quantum tunneling.

In 2002, the simultaneous emission of two protons was observed from the nucleus iron-45 in experiments at GSI and GANIL (Grand Accélérateur National d&#x27;Ions Lourds at Caen). In 2005 it was experimentally determined (at the same facility) that zinc-54 can also undergo double proton decay.

<doc id="391282" wikidata="Q1966921" url="?curid=391282" title="National American Woman Suffrage Association">
<text>The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was an organization formed on February 18, 1890, to advocate in favor of women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States. It was created by the merger of two existing organizations, the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). Its membership, which was about seven thousand at the time it was formed, eventually increased to two million, making it the largest voluntary organization in the nation. It played a pivotal role in the passing of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which in 1920 guaranteed women&#x27;s right to vote.

Susan B. Anthony, a long-time leader in the suffrage movement, was the dominant figure in the newly formed NAWSA. Carrie Chapman Catt, who became president after Anthony retired in 1900, implemented a strategy of recruiting wealthy members of the rapidly growing women&#x27;s club movement, whose time, money and experience could help build the suffrage movement. Anna Howard Shaw&#x27;s term in office, which began in 1904, saw strong growth in the organization&#x27;s membership and public approval.

After the Senate decisively rejected the proposed women&#x27;s suffrage amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1887, the suffrage movement had concentrated most of its efforts on state suffrage campaigns. In 1910 Alice Paul joined the NAWSA and played a major role in reviving interest in the national amendment. After continuing conflicts with the NAWSA leadership over tactics, Paul created a rival organization, the National Woman&#x27;s Party.

When Catt again became president in 1915, the NAWSA adopted her plan to centralize the organization, and work toward the suffrage amendment as its primary goal. This was done despite opposition from Southern members who believed that a federal amendment would erode states&#x27; rights. With its large membership and the increasing number of women voters in states where suffrage had already been achieved, the NAWSA began to operate more as a political pressure group than an educational group. It won additional sympathy for the suffrage cause by actively cooperating with the war effort during World War I. On February 14, 1920, several months prior to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, the NAWSA transformed itself into the League of Women Voters, which is still active.

==Background==

The demand for women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States was controversial even among women&#x27;s rights activists in the early days of the movement. In 1848, a resolution in favor of women&#x27;s right to vote was approved only after vigorous debate at the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women&#x27;s rights convention. By the time of the National Women&#x27;s Rights Conventions in the 1850s, the situation had changed, and women&#x27;s suffrage had become a preeminent goal of the movement.
Three leaders of the women&#x27;s movement during this period, Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony, played prominent roles in the creation of the NAWSA many years later.

In 1866, just after the American Civil War, the Eleventh National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention transformed itself into the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), which worked for equal rights for both African Americans and white women, especially suffrage.
The AERA essentially collapsed in 1869, partly because of disagreement over the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which would enfranchise African American men. Leaders of the women&#x27;s movement were dismayed that it would not also enfranchise women. Stanton and Anthony opposed its ratification unless it was accompanied by another amendment that would enfranchise women.
Stone supported the amendment. She believed that its ratification would spur politicians to support a similar amendment for women. She said that even though the right to vote was more important for women than for black men, &quot;I will be thankful in my soul if &quot;any&quot; body can get out of the terrible pit.&quot;

In May 1869, two days after the acrimonious debates at what turned out to be the final AERA annual meeting, Anthony, Stanton and their allies formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). In November 1869, the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) was formed by Lucy Stone, her husband Henry Blackwell, Julia Ward Howe and their allies, many of whom had helped to create the New England Woman Suffrage Association a year earlier as part of the developing split.
The bitter rivalry between the two organizations created a partisan atmosphere that endured for decades.

Even after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified in 1870, differences between the two organizations remained. The AWSA worked almost exclusively for women&#x27;s suffrage while the NWSA initially worked on a wide range of issues, including divorce reform and equal pay for women. The AWSA included both men and women among its leadership while the NWSA was led by women.
The AWSA worked for suffrage mostly at the state level while the NWSA worked more at the national level.
The AWSA cultivated an image of respectability while the NWSA sometimes used confrontational tactics. Anthony, for example, interrupted the official ceremonies at the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence to present NWSA&#x27;s Declaration of Rights for Women.
Anthony was arrested in 1872 for voting, which was still illegal for women, and was found guilty in a highly publicized trial.

Progress toward women&#x27;s suffrage was slow in the period after the split, but advancement in other areas strengthened the underpinnings of the movement. By 1890, tens of thousands of women were attending colleges and universities, up from zero a few decades earlier.
There was a decline in public support for the idea of &quot;woman&#x27;s sphere&quot;, the belief that a woman&#x27;s place was in the home and that she should not be involved in politics. Laws that had allowed husbands to control their wives&#x27; activities had been significantly revised. There was a dramatic growth in all-female social reform organizations, such as the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), the largest women&#x27;s organization in the country. In a major boost for the suffrage movement, the WCTU endorsed women&#x27;s suffrage in the late 1870s on the grounds that women needed the vote to protect their families from alcohol and other vices.

Anthony increasingly began to emphasize suffrage over other women&#x27;s rights issues. Her aim was to unite the growing number of women&#x27;s organizations in the demand for suffrage even if they did not support other women&#x27;s rights issues. She and the NWSA also began placing less emphasis on confrontational actions and more on respectability. The NWSA was no longer seen as an organization that challenged traditional family arrangements by supporting, for example, what its opponents called &quot;easy divorce&quot;. All this had the effect of moving it into closer alignment with the AWSA.
The Senate&#x27;s rejection in 1887 of the proposed women&#x27;s suffrage amendment to the U.S. Constitution also brought the two organizations closer together. The NWSA had worked for years to convince Congress to bring the proposed amendment to a vote. After it was voted on and decisively rejected, the NWSA began to put less energy into campaigning at the federal level and more at the state level, as the AWSA was already doing.

Stanton continued to promote all aspects of women&#x27;s rights. She advocated a coalition of radical social reform groups, including Populists and Socialists, who would support women&#x27;s suffrage as part of a joint list of demands.
In a letter to a friend, Stanton said the NWSA &quot;has been growing politic and conservative for some time. Lucy [Stone] and Susan [Anthony] alike see suffrage only. They do not see woman&#x27;s religious and social bondage, neither do the young women in either association, hence they may as well combine&quot;.
Stanton, however, had largely withdrawn from the day-to-day activity of the suffrage movement.
She spent much of her time with her daughter in England during this period. Despite their different approaches, Stanton and Anthony remained friends and co-workers, continuing a collaboration that had begun in the early 1850s.

Stone devoted most of her life after the split to the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a weekly newspaper she launched in 1870 to serve as voice of the AWSA. By the 1880s, the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; had broadened its coverage and was seen by many as the newspaper of the entire movement.

The suffrage movement was attracting younger members who were impatient with the continuing division, seeing the obstacle more as a matter of personalities than principles. Alice Stone Blackwell, daughter of Lucy Stone, said, &quot;When I began to work for a union, the elders were not keen for it, on either side, but the younger women on both sides were. Nothing really stood in the way except the unpleasant feelings engendered during the long separation&quot;.

==Merger of rival organizations==
Several attempts had been made to bring the two sides together, but without success.
The situation changed in 1887 when Stone, who was approaching her 70th birthday and in declining health, began to seek ways of overcoming the split. In a letter to suffragist Antoinette Brown Blackwell, she suggested the creation of an umbrella organization of which the AWSA and the NWSA would become auxiliaries, but that idea did not gain supporters.
In November 1887, the AWSA annual meeting passed a resolution authorizing Stone to confer with Anthony about the possibility of a merger. The resolution said the differences between the two associations had &quot;been largely removed by the adoption of common principles and methods.&quot;
Stone forwarded the resolution to Anthony along with an invitation to meet with her.

Anthony and Rachel Foster, a young leader of the NWSA, traveled to Boston in December 1887, to meet with Stone. Accompanying Stone at this meeting was her daughter Alice Stone Blackwell, who also was an officer of the AWSA. Stanton, who was in England at the time, did not attend. The meeting explored several aspects of a possible merger, including the name of the new organization and its structure. Stone had second thoughts soon afterwards, telling a friend she wished they had never offered to unite, but the merger process slowly continued.

An early public sign of improving relations between the two organizations occurred three months later at the founding congress of the International Council of Women, which the NWSA organized and hosted in Washington in conjunction with the fortieth anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention. It received favorable publicity, and its delegates, who came from fifty-three women&#x27;s organizations in nine countries, were invited to a reception at the White House. Representatives from the AWSA were invited to sit on the platform during the meetings along with representatives from the NWSA, signaling a new atmosphere of cooperation.

The proposed merger did not generate significant controversy within the AWSA. The call to its annual meeting in 1887, the one that authorized Stone to explore the possibility of merger, did not even mention that this issue would be on the agenda. This proposal was treated in a routine manner during the meeting and was approved unanimously without debate.

The situation was different within the NWSA, where there was strong opposition from Matilda Joslyn Gage, Olympia Brown and others.
Ida Husted Harper, Anthony&#x27;s co-worker and biographer, said the NWSA meetings that dealt with this issue &quot;were the most stormy in the history of the association.&quot;
Charging that Anthony had used underhanded tactics to thwart opposition to the merger, Gage formed a competing organization in 1890 called the Woman&#x27;s National Liberal Union, but it did not develop a significant following.

The AWSA and NWSA committees that negotiated the terms of merger signed a basis for agreement in January, 1889. In February, Stone, Stanton, Anthony and other leaders of both organizations issued an &quot;Open Letter to the Women of America&quot; declaring their intention to work together. When Anthony and Stone first discussed the possibility of merger in 1887, Stone had proposed that she, Stanton and Anthony should all decline the presidency of the united organization. Anthony initially agreed, but other NWSA members objected strongly. The basis for agreement did not include that stipulation.

The AWSA initially was the larger of the two organizations,
but it had declined in strength during the 1880s.
The NWSA was perceived as the main representative of the suffrage movement, partly because of Anthony&#x27;s ability to find dramatic ways of bringing suffrage to the nation&#x27;s attention.
Anthony and Stanton had also published their massive History of Woman Suffrage, which placed them at the center of the movement&#x27;s history and marginalized the role of Stone and the AWSA.
Stone&#x27;s public visibility had declined significantly, contrasting sharply with the attention she had attracted in her younger days as a speaker on the national lecture circuit.

Anthony was increasingly recognized as a person of political importance. In 1890, prominent members of the House and Senate were among the two hundred people who attended her seventieth birthday celebration, a national event that took place in Washington three days before the convention that united the two suffrage organizations. Anthony and Stanton pointedly reaffirmed their friendship at this event, frustrating opponents of merger who had hoped to set them against one another.

==Founding convention==
The National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) was created on February 18, 1890, in Washington by a convention that merged the NWSA and the AWSA. The question of who would lead the new organization had been left to the convention delegates. Stone, from the AWSA, was too ill to attend this convention and was not a candidate.
Anthony and Stanton, both from the NWSA, each had supporters.

The AWSA and NWSA executive committees met separately beforehand to discuss their choices for president of the united organization. At the AWSA meeting, Henry Blackwell, Stone&#x27;s husband, said the NWSA had agreed to avoid mixing in side issues (the approach associated with Stanton) and to focus exclusively on suffrage (the approach of the AWSA and increasingly of Anthony). The executive committee recommended that AWSA delegates vote for Anthony. At the NWSA meeting, Anthony strongly urged its members not to vote for her but for Stanton, saying that a defeat of Stanton would be viewed as a repudiation of her role in the movement.

Elections were held at the convention&#x27;s opening. Stanton received 131 votes for president, Anthony received 90, and 2 votes were cast for other candidates. Anthony was elected vice president at large with 213 votes, with 9 votes for other candidates. Stone was unanimously elected chair of the executive committee.

As president, Stanton delivered the convention&#x27;s opening address. She urged the new organization to concern itself with a broad range of reforms, saying, &quot;When any principle or question is up for discussion, let us seize on it and show its connection, whether nearly or remotely, with woman&#x27;s disfranchisement.&quot;
She introduced controversial resolutions, including one that called for women to be included at all levels of leadership within religious organizations and one that described liberal divorce laws as a married woman&#x27;s &quot;door of escape from bondage.&quot;
Her speech had little lasting impact on the organization, however, because most of the younger suffragists did not agree with her approach.

==Stanton and Anthony presidencies==

Stanton&#x27;s election as president was largely symbolic. Before the convention was over, she left for another extended stay with her daughter in England, leaving Anthony in charge.
Stanton retired from the presidency in 1892, after which Anthony was elected to the position that she had in practice been occupying all along.
Stone, who died in 1893, did not play a major role in the NAWSA.

The movement&#x27;s vigor declined in the years immediately after the merger.
The new organization was small, having only about 7000 dues-paying members in 1893.
It also suffered from organizational problems, not having a clear idea of, for example, how many local suffrage clubs there were or who their officers were.

In 1893, NAWSA members May Wright Sewall, former chair of NWSA&#x27;s executive committee, and Rachel Foster Avery, NAWSA&#x27;s corresponding secretary, played key roles in the World&#x27;s Congress of Representative Women at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, which was also known as the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. Sewall served as chair and Avery as secretary of the organizing committee for the women&#x27;s congress.

In 1893, the NAWSA voted over Anthony&#x27;s objection to alternate the site of its annual conventions between Washington and other parts of the country. Anthony&#x27;s pre-merger NWSA had always held its conventions in Washington to help maintain focus on a national suffrage amendment. Anthony said she feared, accurately as it turned out, that the NAWSA would engage in suffrage work at the state level at the expense of national work.
The NAWSA routinely allocated no funding at all for congressional work, which at this stage consisted only of one day of testimony before Congress each year.

===&quot;Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;===
Stanton&#x27;s radicalism did not sit well with the new organization. In 1895 she published &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;, a controversial best-seller that attacked the use of the Bible to relegate women to an inferior status. Her opponents within the NAWSA reacted strongly. They felt that the book would harm the drive for women&#x27;s suffrage. Rachel Foster Avery, the organization&#x27;s corresponding secretary, sharply denounced Stanton&#x27;s book in her annual report to the 1896 convention. The NAWSA voted to disavow any connection with the book despite Anthony&#x27;s strong objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful.

The negative reaction to the book contributed to a sharp decline in Stanton&#x27;s influence in the suffrage movement and to her increasing alienation from it. She sent letters to each NAWSA convention, however, and Anthony insisted that they be read even when their topics were controversial.
Stanton died in 1902.

===Southern strategy===
The South had traditionally shown little interest in women&#x27;s suffrage. When the proposed suffrage amendment to the Constitution was rejected by the Senate in 1887, it received no votes at all from southern senators.
This indicated a problem for the future because it was almost impossible for any amendment to be ratified by the required number of states without at least some support from the South.

In 1867, Henry Blackwell proposed a solution: convince southern political leaders that they could ensure white supremacy in their region by enfranchising educated women, who would predominantly be white. Blackwell presented his plan to politicians from Mississippi, who gave it serious consideration, a development that drew the interest of many suffragists. Blackwell&#x27;s ally in this effort was Laura Clay, who convinced the NAWSA to launch a campaign in the South based on Blackwell&#x27;s strategy. Clay was one of several southern NAWSA members who objected to the proposed national women&#x27;s suffrage amendment on the grounds that it would impinge on states&#x27; rights.

Susan B. Anthony and Carrie Chapman Catt traveled through the South en route to the NAWSA convention in Atlanta. Anthony asked her old friend Frederick Douglass, a former slave, not to attend the NAWSA convention in Atlanta in 1895, the first to be held in a southern city. Black NAWSA members were excluded from 1903 convention in the southern city of New Orleans. The NAWSA executive board issued a statement during the convention that said, &quot;The doctrine of State&#x27;s rights is recognized in the national body, and each auxiliary State association arranges its own affairs in accordance with its own ideas and in harmony with the customs of its own section.&quot; As NAWSA turned its attention to a Constitutional Amendment, many Southern suffragists remained opposed because a federal amendment would enfranchise Black women. In response, in 1914, Kate Gordon founded the Southern States Woman Suffrage Conference, which opposed the Nineteenth Amendment.

=== First Catt presidency ===
Carrie Chapman Catt joined the suffrage movement in Iowa in the mid-1880s. and soon became part of the leadership of the state suffrage association. Married to a wealthy engineer who encouraged her suffrage work, she was able to devote much of her energy to the movement. She led some smaller NAWSA committees, for example serving as Chairman of the Literature Committee in 1893 with the help of Mary Hutcheson Page, another active NAWSA member. In 1895, she was placed in charge of NAWSA&#x27;s Organizational Committee, where she raised money to put a team of fourteen organizers in the field. By 1899, suffrage organizations had been established in every state. When Anthony retired as NAWSA president in 1900, she chose Catt to succeed her.
Anthony remained an influential figure in the organization, however, until she died in 1906.

One of Catt&#x27;s first actions as president was to implement the &quot;society plan,&quot; a campaign to recruit wealthy members of the rapidly growing women&#x27;s club movement, whose time, money and experience could help build the suffrage movement. 
Primarily composed of middle-class women, the targeted clubs often engaged in civic improvement projects. They generally avoided controversial issues, but women&#x27;s suffrage increasingly found acceptance among their membership. 
In 1914, suffrage was endorsed by the General Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs, the national body for the club movement.

To make the suffrage movement more attractive to middle- and upper-class women, the NAWSA began to popularize a version of the movement&#x27;s history that downplayed the earlier involvement of many of its members with such controversial issues as racial equality, divorce reform, working women&#x27;s rights and critiques of organized religion. Stanton&#x27;s role in the movement was obscured by this process, as were the roles of black and working women.
Anthony, who in her younger days was often treated as a dangerous fanatic, was given a grandmotherly image and honored as a &quot;suffrage saint.&quot;

The reform energy of the Progressive Era strengthened the suffrage movement during this period. Beginning around 1900, this broad movement began at the grassroots level with such goals as combating corruption in government, eliminating child labor, and protecting workers and consumers. Many of its participants saw women&#x27;s suffrage as yet another progressive goal, and they believed that the addition of women to the electorate would help the movement achieve its other goals.

Catt resigned her position after four years, partly because of her husband&#x27;s declining health and partly to help organize the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, which was created in Berlin in 1904 in coordination with the NAWSA and with Catt as president.

==Shaw presidency==
In 1904, Anna Howard Shaw, another Anthony protégé, was elected president of the NAWSA, serving more years in that office than any other person. Shaw was an energetic worker and a talented orator. Her administrative and interpersonal skills did not match those that Catt would display during her second term in office, but the organization made striking gains under Shaw&#x27;s leadership.

In 1906, southern NAWSA members formed the Southern Woman Suffrage Conference with Blackwell&#x27;s encouragement. Although it had a frankly racist program, it asked for NAWSA&#x27;s endorsement. Shaw refused, setting a limit on how far the organization was willing to go to accommodate southerners with overtly racist views. Shaw said the organization would not adopt policies that &quot;advocated the exclusion of any race or class from the right of suffrage.&quot;

In 1907, partly in reaction to NAWSA&#x27;s &quot;society plan&quot;, which was designed to appeal to upper-class women, Harriet Stanton Blatch, daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, formed a competing organization called the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women.
Later known as the Women&#x27;s Political Union, its membership was based on working women, both professional and industrial. Blatch had recently returned to the United States after several years in England, where she had worked with suffrage groups in the early phases of employing militant tactics as part of their campaign. The Equality League gained a following by engaging in activities that many members of the NAWSA initially considered too daring, such as suffrage parades and open air rallies.
Blatch said that when she joined the suffrage movement in the U.S., &quot;The only method suggested for furthering the cause was the slow process of education. We were told to organize, organize, organize, to the end of educating, educating, educating public opinion.&quot;

In 1908, the National College Equal Suffrage League was formed as an affiliate of the NAWSA. It had its origins in the College Equal Suffrage League, which was formed in Boston in 1900 at a time when there were relatively few college students in the NAWSA. It was established by Maud Wood Park, who later helped create similar groups in 30 states. Park later became a prominent leader of the NAWSA.

By 1908, Catt was once again at the forefront of activity. She and her co-workers developed a detailed plan to unite the various suffrage associations in New York City (and later in the entire state) in an organization modeled on political machines like Tammany Hall. In 1909, they founded the Woman Suffrage Party (WSP) at a convention attended by over a thousand delegates and alternates. By 1910, the WSP had 20,000 members and a four-room headquarters. Shaw was not entirely comfortable with the independent initiatives of the WSP, but Catt and other of its leaders remained loyal to the NAWSA, its parent organization.

In 1909, Frances Squires Potter, a NAWSA member from Chicago, proposed the creation of suffrage community centers called &quot;political settlements.&quot; Reminiscent of the social settlement houses, such as Hull House in Chicago, their purpose was to educate the public about suffrage and the practical details of political activity at the local level. The political settlements established by the WSP included suffrage schools that provided training in public speaking to suffrage organizers.

Public sentiment toward the suffrage movement improved dramatically during this period. Working for suffrage came to be seen as a respectable activity for middle-class women. By 1910, NAWSA membership had jumped to 117,000.
The NAWSA established its first permanent headquarters that year in New York City, previously having operated mainly out of the homes of its officers.
Maud Wood Park, who had been away in Europe for two years, received a letter that year from one of her co-workers in the College Equal Suffrage League who described the new atmosphere by saying, &quot;the movement which when we got into it had about as much energy as a dying kitten, is now a big, virile, threatening thing&quot; and is &quot;actually fashionable now.&quot;

The change in public sentiment was reflected in efforts to win suffrage at the state level. In 1896, only four states, all of them in the West, allowed women to vote. From 1896 to 1910, there were six state campaigns for suffrage, and they all failed. The tide began to turn in 1910 when suffrage was won in the state of Washington, followed by California in 1911, Oregon, Kansas and Arizona in 1912, and others afterwards.

In 1912, W. E. B. Du Bois, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), publicly challenged NAWSA&#x27;s reluctance to accept black women. The NAWSA responded in a cordial way, inviting him to speak at its next convention and publishing his speech as a pamphlet.
Nonetheless the NAWSA continued to minimize the role of black suffragists. It accepted some black women as members and some black societies as auxiliaries, but its general practice was to turn such requests politely away.
This was partly because attitudes of racial superiority were the norm among white Americans of that era, and partly because the NAWSA believed it had little hope of achieving a national amendment without at least some support from southern states that practiced racial segregation.

NAWSA&#x27;s strategy at that point was to gain suffrage for women on a state-by-state basis until it achieved a critical mass of voters that could push through a suffrage amendment at the national level.
In 1913, the Southern States Woman Suffrage Committee was formed in an attempt to stop that process from moving past the state level. It was led by Kate Gordon, who had been the NAWSA&#x27;s corresponding secretary from 1901 to 1909.
Gordon, who was from the southern state of Louisiana, supported women&#x27;s suffrage, but opposed the idea of a federal suffrage amendment, charging that it would violate states&#x27; rights. She said that empowering federal authorities to enforce a constitutional right for women to vote in the South could lead to similar enforcement of the constitutional right of African Americans to vote there, a right that was being evaded, and, in her opinion, rightly so. Her committee was too small to seriously affect the NAWSA&#x27;s direction, but her public condemnation of the proposed amendment, expressed in terms of vehement racism, deepened fissures within the organization.

Despite the rapid growth in NAWSA membership, discontent with Shaw grew. Her tendency to overreact to those who differed with her had the effect of increasing organizational friction.
Several members resigned from executive board in 1910, and the board saw significant changes in its composition every year after that through 1915.

In 1914, Senator John Shafroth introduced a federal amendment that would require state legislatures to put women&#x27;s suffrage on the state ballot if eight percent of the voters signed a petition to that effect. The NAWSA endorsed the proposed amendment, whereupon the CU accused it of abandoning the drive for a national suffrage amendment. Amid confusion among the membership, delegates at the 1914 convention directed their dissatisfaction at Shaw.
Shaw had considered declining the presidency in 1914, but decided to run again. In 1915, she announced that she would not be running for reelection.

== Relocation to Warren, Ohio ==
For several years, Harriet Taylor Upton led the woman suffragist movement in Trumbull County, Ohio. In 1880, Upton&#x27;s father was elected as a member of the United States Congress as a Republican from Ohio. This connection provided Upton the opportunity to meet Susan B. Anthony, who brought Upton into the suffragist movement.

In 1894, Upton was elected as the NAWSA&#x27;s treasurer. In addition, Upton served as president of the Ohio association of the national association, from 1899-1908 and 1911–1920. Upton helped relocate the national headquarters for the NAWSA to her home in Warren, Ohio, in 1903. According to the Tribune Chronicle, &quot;it was only supposed to be a temporary move, but it lasted six years. Susan B. Anthony, noted leader of the women&#x27;s movement, visited Warren many times, including a 1904 trip to attend a national women&#x27;s rights meeting here.&quot;

During this period, the nation&#x27;s attention regarding women&#x27;s rights was focused on Warren. The association&#x27;s offices were located on the ground level of the Trumbull Court House, a building currently occupied by the Probate Court. While the headquarters left the Upton House around 1910, Warren remained active in the suffrage movement. The people of Warren were active in various programs of the national movement for years, until the 19th Amendment was ratified by a sufficient number of states, and authorized by President Wilson in 1920.

In 1993, the Upton House joined the list of historic landmarks.

==Split in the movement==
A serious challenge to the NAWSA leadership began to develop after a young activist named Alice Paul returned to the U.S. from England in 1910, where she had been part of the militant wing of the suffrage movement. She had been jailed there and had endured forced feedings after going on a hunger strike.
Joining the NAWSA, she became the person most responsible for reviving interest within the suffrage movement for a national amendment, which for years had been overshadowed by campaigns for suffrage at the state level.

From Shaw&#x27;s point of view, the time was right for a renewed emphasis on a suffrage amendment. Gordon and Clay, the most persistent adversaries of a federal suffrage amendment within NAWSA, had been out-maneuvered by their opponents and no longer held national posts.
In 1912, Alice Paul was appointed chair of NAWSA&#x27;s Congressional Committee and charged with reviving the drive for a women&#x27;s suffrage amendment. In 1913, she and her coworker Lucy Burns organized the Woman Suffrage Procession, a suffrage parade in Washington on the day before Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s inauguration as president. Onlookers who opposed the march turned the event into a near riot, which ended only when a cavalry unit of the army was brought in to restore order. Public outrage over the incident, which cost the chief of police his job, brought publicity to the movement and gave it fresh momentum.

Paul troubled NAWSA leaders by arguing that because Democrats would not act to enfranchise women even though they controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress, the suffrage movement should work for the defeat of all Democrats regardless of an individual candidate&#x27;s position on suffrage. NAWSA&#x27;s policy was to follow the opposite approach, supporting any candidate who endorsed suffrage, regardless of political party.
In 1913, Paul and Burns formed the Congressional Union (CU) to work solely for a national amendment and sent organizers into states that already had NAWSA organizations. The relationship between the CU and the NAWSA became unclear and troubled over time.

At the NAWSA convention in 1913, Paul and her allies demanded that the organization focus its efforts on a federal suffrage amendment. The convention instead empowered the executive board to limit the CU&#x27;s ability to contravene NAWSA policies. After negotiations failed to resolve their differences, the NAWSA removed Paul as head of its Congressional Committee. By February, 1914, the NAWSA and the CU had effectively separated into two independent organizations.

Blatch merged her Women&#x27;s Political Union into the CU.
That organization in turn became the basis for the National Woman&#x27;s Party (NWP), which Paul formed in 1916.
Once again there were two competing national women&#x27;s suffrage organizations, but the result this time was something like a division of labor. The NAWSA burnished its image of respectability and engaged in highly organized lobbying at both the national and state levels. The smaller NWP also engaged in lobbying but became increasingly known for activities that were dramatic and confrontational, most often in the national capital.

==Second Catt presidency, 1915-1920==
Carrie Chapman Catt, the NAWSA&#x27;s previous president, was the obvious choice to replace Anna Howard Shaw, but Catt was leading the New York State Woman Suffrage Party, which was in the early stages of a crucial suffrage campaign in that state.
The prevailing belief in the NAWSA was that success in a large eastern state would be the tipping point for the national campaign.
New York was the largest state in the union, and victory there was a real possibility. Catt agreed to turn the New York work over to others and to accept the NAWSA presidency in December, 1915 on the condition that she could name her own executive board, which previously had always been elected by the annual convention. She appointed to the board women of independent means who could work for the movement full-time.

Backed by an increased level of commitment and unity in the national office, Catt sent its officers into the field to assess the state of the organization and start the process of reorganizing it into a more centralized and efficient operation. Catt described the NAWSA as a camel with a hundred humps, each with a blind driver trying to lead the way. She provided a new sense of direction by sending out a stream of communications to state and local affiliates with policy directives, organizational initiatives and detailed plans of work.

The NAWSA previously had devoted much of its effort to educating the public about suffrage, and it had made a significant impact. Women&#x27;s suffrage had become a major national issue, and the NAWSA was in the process of becoming the nation&#x27;s largest voluntary organization, with two million members.
Catt built on that foundation to convert the NAWSA into an organization that operated primarily as a political pressure group.

===1916===
At an executive board meeting in March, 1916, Catt described the organization&#x27;s dilemma by saying, &quot;The Congressional Union is drawing off from the National Association those women who feel it is possible to work for suffrage by the Federal route only. Certain workers in the south are being antagonized because the National is continuing to work for the Federal Amendment. The combination has produced a great muddle&quot;.
Catt believed that NAWSA&#x27;s policy of working primarily on state-by-state campaigns was nearing its limits. Some states appeared unlikely ever to approve women&#x27;s suffrage, in some cases because state laws made constitutional revision extremely difficult, and in others, especially in the Deep South, because opposition was simply too strong.
Catt refocused the organization on a national suffrage amendment while continuing to conduct state campaigns where success was a realistic possibility.

When the conventions of the Democratic and Republican parties met in June, 1916, suffragists applied pressure to both. Catt was invited to express her views in a speech to the Republican convention in Chicago. An anti-suffragist spoke after Catt, and as she was telling the convention that women did not want to vote, a crowd of suffragists burst into the hall and filled the aisles. They were soaking wet, having marched in heavy rain for several blocks in a parade led by two elephants. When the flustered anti-suffragist concluded her remarks, the suffragists led a cheer for their cause. At the Democratic convention a week later in St. Louis, suffragists packed the galleries and made their views known during the debate on suffrage.

Both party conventions endorsed women&#x27;s suffrage but only at the state level, which meant that different states might implement it in different ways and in some cases not at all. Having expected more, Catt called an Emergency Convention, moving the date of the 1916 convention from December to September to begin organizing a renewed push for the federal amendment.
The convention initiated a strategic shift by adopting Catt&#x27;s &quot;Winning Plan&quot;. This plan mandated work toward the national suffrage amendment as the priority for the entire organization and authorized the creation of a professional lobbying team to support this goal in Washington. It authorized the executive board to specify a plan of work toward this goal for each state and to take over that work if the state organization refused to comply. It agreed to fund state suffrage campaigns only if they met strict requirements that were designed to eliminate efforts with little chance of succeeding.
Catt&#x27;s plan included milestones for achieving a women&#x27;s suffrage amendment by 1922.
Gordon, whose states&#x27; rights approach had been decisively defeated, exclaimed to a friend, &quot;A well-oiled steam roller has ironed this convention flat!&quot;

President Wilson, whose attitude toward women&#x27;s suffrage was evolving, spoke at the 1916 NAWSA convention. He had been considered an opponent of suffrage when he was governor of New Jersey, but in 1915 he announced that he was traveling from the White House back to his home state to vote in favor of it in New Jersey&#x27;s state referendum. He spoke favorably of suffrage at the NAWSA convention but stopped short of supporting the suffrage amendment.
Charles Evans Hughes, his opponent in the presidential election that year, declined to speak at the convention, but he went farther than Wilson by endorsing the suffrage amendment.

NAWSA&#x27;s Congressional Committee had been in disarray ever since Alice Paul was removed from it in 1913. Catt reorganized the committee and appointed Maud Wood Park as its head in December, 1916. Park and her lieutenant Helen Hamilton Gardener created what became known as the &quot;Front Door Lobby&quot;, so named by a journalist because it operated openly, avoiding the traditional lobbying methods of &quot;backstairs&quot; dealing. A headquarters for the lobbying effort was established in a dilapidated mansion known as Suffrage House. NAWSA lobbyists lodged there and coordinated their activities with daily conferences in its meeting rooms.

In 1916 the NAWSA purchased the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot; from Alice Stone Blackwell. The newspaper had been established in 1870 by Blackwell&#x27;s mother, Lucy Stone, and had served as the primary voice of the suffrage movement most of the time since then. It had significant limitations, however. It was a small operation, with Blackwell herself doing most of the work, and with much of its reporting centered on the eastern part of the country at a time when a national newspaper was needed.
After the transfer, it was renamed &quot;Woman Citizen&quot; and merged with &quot;The Woman Voter&quot;, the journal of the Woman Suffrage Party of New York City, and with &quot;National Suffrage News&quot;, the former journal of the NAWSA. 
The newspaper&#x27;s masthead declared itself to be the NAWSA&#x27;s official organ.

===1917===
In 1917 Catt received a bequest of $900,000 from Mrs. Frank (Miriam) Leslie to be used as she thought best for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Catt allocated most of the funds to the NAWSA, with $400,000 applied toward upgrading the &quot;Woman Citizen&quot;.

In January 1917, Alice Paul&#x27;s NWP began picketing the White House with banners that demanded women&#x27;s suffrage. The police eventually arrested over 200 of the Silent Sentinels, many of whom went on hunger strike after being imprisoned. The prison authorities force fed them, creating an uproar that fueled public debate on women&#x27;s suffrage.

When the U.S. entered World War I in April 1917, the NAWSA cooperated with the war effort. Shaw was appointed as head of the Women&#x27;s Committee for the Council of National Defense, which was established by the federal government to coordinate resources for the war and to promote public morale. Catt and two other NAWSA members were appointed to its executive committee.
The NWP, by contrast, took no part in the war effort and charged that the NAWSA did so at the expense of suffrage work.

In April 1917, Jeannette Rankin of Montana took her seat as the first woman in Congress, having previously served as lobbyist and field secretary for the NAWSA. Rankin voted against the declaration of war.

In November 1917, the suffrage movement achieved a major victory when a referendum to enfranchise women passed by a large margin in New York, the most populous state in the country.
The powerful Tammany Hall political machine, which had previously opposed suffrage, took a neutral stance on this referendum, partly because the wives of several Tammany Hall leaders played prominent roles in the suffrage campaign.

===1918–19===

The House passed the suffrage amendment for the first time in January, 1918, but the Senate delayed its debate on the measure until September. President Wilson took the unusual step of appearing before the Senate to speak on the issue, asking for passage of the amendment as a war measure. The Senate, however, defeated the measure by two votes.
The NAWSA launched a campaign to unseat four senators who had voted against the amendment, assembling a coalition of forces that included labor unions and prohibitionists. Two of those four senators were defeated in the federal elections in November.

NAWSA held its Golden Jubilee Convention at the Statler Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri in March 1919. President Catt gave the opening address, in which she urged the delegates to create a league of women voters. A resolution was passed to form this league as a separate unit of NAWSA, with membership coming from states who allowed women to vote. The league was charged with achieving full suffrage and consideration of legislation that affected women in states where they were able to vote. On the last day of the convention, the Missouri senate passed legislation giving women the right to vote in presidential elections in Missouri and a resolution to submit a constitutional amendment for full suffrage. In June of that year, the Nineteenth Amendment was passed.

===Passage of the Nineteenth Amendment===
After the elections, Wilson called a special session of Congress, which passed the suffrage amendment on June 4, 1919.
The struggle now passed to the state legislatures, three-fourths of which would need to ratify the amendment before it would become law.

Catt and the NAWSA executive board had been planning their work in support of the ratification effort since April 1918, over a year before Congress passed the amendment. Ratification committees had already been established in state capitals, each with its own budget and plan of work. Immediately after Congress passed the amendment, Suffrage House and the federal lobbying operation were shut down and resources were diverted to the ratification drive.
Catt had a sense of urgency, expecting a slowdown in reform energy after the war, which had ended seven months earlier. Many local suffrage societies had disbanded in states where women could already vote, making it more difficult to organize a quick ratification.

By the end of 1919, women effectively could vote for president in states that had a majority of electoral votes.
Political leaders who were convinced that women&#x27;s suffrage was inevitable began to pressure local and national legislators to support it so their party could claim credit for it in future elections. The conventions of both the Democratic and Republican Parties endorsed the amendment in June, 1920.

Former NAWSA members Kate Gordon and Laura Clay organized opposition to the amendment&#x27;s ratification in the South. They had resigned from the NAWSA in the fall of 1918 at the executive board&#x27;s request because of their public statements in opposition to a federal amendment.
Only three Southern or border states, Arkansas, Texas, and Tennessee, ratified the 19th Amendment, with Tennessee being the crucial 36th state to ratify.

The Nineteenth Amendment, the women&#x27;s suffrage amendment, became the law of the land on August 26, 1920, when it was certified by the United States Secretary of State.

===Transition into the League of Women Voters===
Six months before the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified, the NAWSA held its last convention. That convention created the League of Women Voters as the NAWSA&#x27;s successor on February 14, 1920, with Maud Wood Park, former head of the NAWSA&#x27;s Congressional Committee, as its president. The League of Women Voters was formed to help women play a larger part in public affairs as they won the right to vote. It was meant to help women exercise their right to vote. Before 1973 only women could join the league.

<doc id="391283" wikidata="Q898923" url="?curid=391283" title="Neutron emission">
<text>Neutron emission is a mode of radioactive decay in which one or more neutrons are ejected from a nucleus. It occurs in the most neutron-rich/proton-deficient nuclides, and also from excited states of other nuclides as in photoneutron emission and beta-delayed neutron emission. As only a neutron is lost by this process the number of protons remains unchanged, and an atom does not become an atom of a different element, but a different isotope of the same element.

Neutrons are also produced in the spontaneous and induced fission of certain heavy nuclides.

==Spontaneous neutron emission==
As a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, nuclei with an excess of protons or neutrons have a higher average energy per nucleon. Nuclei with a sufficient excess of neutrons have a greater energy than the combination of a free neutron and a nucleus with one less neutron, and therefore can decay by neutron emission. Nuclei which can decay by this process are described as lying beyond the neutron drip line.

Two examples of isotopes that emit neutrons are beryllium-13 (decaying to beryllium-12 with a mean life ) and helium-5 (helium-4, ).

In tables of nuclear decay modes, neutron emission is commonly denoted by the abbreviation &quot;n&quot;.


=== Double neutron emission ===
Some neutron-rich isotopes decay by the emission of two or more neutrons. For example, hydrogen-5 and helium-10 decay by the emission of two neutrons, hydrogen-6 by the emission of 3 or 4 neutrons, and hydrogen-7 by emission of 4 neutrons.

==Photoneutron emission==

Some nuclides can be induced to eject a neutron by gamma radiation. One such nuclide is 9Be; its photodisintegration is significant in nuclear astrophysics, pertaining to the abundance of beryllium and the consequences of the instability of 8Be. This also makes this isotope useful as a neutron source in nuclear reactors. Another nuclide, 181Ta, is also known to be readily capable of photodisintegration; this process is thought to be responsible for the creation of 180mTa, the only primordial nuclear isomer and the rarest primordial nuclide.

== Beta-delayed neutron emission ==

Neutron emission usually happens from nuclei that are in an excited state, such as the excited 17O* produced from the beta decay of 17N. The neutron emission process itself is controlled by the nuclear force and therefore is extremely fast, sometimes referred to as &quot;nearly instantaneous&quot;. This process allows unstable atoms to become more stable. The ejection of the neutron may be as a product of the movement of many nucleons, but it is ultimately mediated by the repulsive action of the nuclear force that exists at extremely short-range distances between nucleons.

=== Delayed neutrons in reactor control ===
Most neutron emission outside prompt neutron production associated with fission (either induced or spontaneous), is from neutron-heavy isotopes produced as fission products. These neutrons are sometimes emitted with a delay, giving them the term delayed neutrons, but the actual delay in their production is a delay waiting for the beta decay of fission products to produce the excited-state nuclear precursors that immediately undergo prompt neutron emission. Thus, the delay in neutron emission is not from the neutron-production process, but rather its precursor beta decay, which is controlled by the weak force, and thus requires a far longer time. The beta decay half lives for the precursors to delayed neutron-emitter radioisotopes, are typically fractions of a second to tens of seconds.

Nevertheless, the delayed neutrons emitted by neutron-rich fission products aid control of nuclear reactors by making reactivity change far more slowly than it would if it were controlled by prompt neutrons alone. About 0.65% of neutrons are released in a nuclear chain reaction in a delayed way due to the mechanism of neutron emission, and it is this fraction of neutrons that allows a nuclear reactor to be controlled on human reaction time-scales, without proceeding to a prompt critical state, and runaway melt down.

== Neutron emission in fission ==
===Induced fission===
A synonym for such neutron emission is &quot;prompt neutron&quot; production, of the type that is best known to occur simultaneously with induced nuclear fission. Induced fission happens only when a nucleus is bombarded with neutrons, gamma rays, or other carriers of energy. Many heavy isotopes, most notably californium-252, also emit prompt neutrons among the products of a similar spontaneous radioactive decay process, spontaneous fission.

===Spontaneous fission===
Spontaneous fission happens when a nucleus splits into two (occasionally three) smaller nuclei and generally one or more neutrons.

<text>Danny Lee Burton (born June 21, 1938) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for , and previously the , serving from 1983 until 2013. He is a member of the Republican Party and was part of the Tea Party Caucus.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Burton was born in Indianapolis, the son of Bonnie L. (née Hardesty) and Charles W. Burton. His father, a former policeman, was abusive to his mother, and never held a job for very long. The family moved constantly, living in trailer parks, cabins, and motels. In June 1950, some years after the couple divorced, his mother went to the police and got a restraining order against his father. He responded by kidnapping Burton&#x27;s mother. Burton and his younger brother and sister were briefly sent to the Marion County Children&#x27;s Guardian Home. After his mother escaped, Burton&#x27;s father went to jail for two years. Burton&#x27;s mother remarried, and Burton and his younger brother and sister had happier teenage years.

Burton worked as a caddy at a local country club in order to make ends meet, where he learned the golf skills that led to his winning a statewide golf championship in high school. He graduated from Shortridge High School in 1957, and attended Indiana University (1958–59) and the Cincinnati Bible Seminary (now known as Cincinnati Christian University) (1959–60). He served in the United States Army from 1956 to 1957, before leaving active duty to return to college but remained in the Army Reserves from 1957 to 1962. After school, Burton became a real estate broker and he founded the Dan Burton Insurance Agency in 1968.

==Indiana legislature==
Burton was a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1967 to 1968 and again from 1977 to 1980 and the Indiana State Senate from 1969 to 1970 and again from 1981 to 1982.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

Burton first ran for Congress in 1970, losing to Democratic incumbent Andy Jacobs in Indiana&#x27;s 11th congressional district. Burton ran again in 1972, losing in the Republican primary to William Hudnut.

After the 1980 census, the Republican-controlled state legislature reconfigured the 6th District into a heavily Republican district focused on the suburbs north of Indianapolis. The district&#x27;s four-term Democratic incumbent, David W. Evans, opted to challenge Jacobs in the Democratic primary (which he lost) rather than face certain defeat. Burton jumped into the Republican primary halfway into his second stint in the state senate, and won a five-way Republican primary with 37% of the vote. He then defeated Democrat George Grabianowski in the general election 65%–35%. He would be reelected 14 times, never dropping below 62% in a general election. His district was renumbered as the 5th District after the 2000 census.

;2008
In 2008, Burton faced a reasonably well-funded challenger in the Republican primary for the first time since his initial run for the seat in former Marion County Coroner John McGoff. Burton defeated McGoff 52% to 45% in the closest Republican primary election of his career.

;2010

In 2010, he faced six challengers in the Republican primary. He won the primary with a plurality of 30%. He defeated State Representative Luke Messer (28%), McGoff (19%), State Representative Mike Murphy (9%), Brose McVey (8%), Andy Lyons (4%), and Ann Adcock (3%). Burton only carried a majority in one county (55%): Huntington.

;2012

In 2012, Burton was due to face a number of challengers in the Republican primary including McGoff, former U.S. Attorney Susan Brooks, former U.S. Congressman David McIntosh, and attorney Jack Lugar. On the Democratic side, State Representative Scott Reske and labor activist Tony Long entered the race. While the reconfigured 5th is still a Republican stronghold, it is said to be slightly more Democratic than its predecessor. On January 31, 2012, Burton abruptly announced his retirement, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get into it, it&#x27;s about personal problems with family health.&quot; Brooks won the election.

===Tenure===
;Helms–Burton bill
In 1995, Burton authored legislation targeting foreign companies that did business with Cuba. The bill allowed foreign companies to be sued in American courts if, in dealings with the government of Fidel Castro, they acquired assets formerly owned by Americans. In February 1996, Cuba shot down two small Brothers to the Rescue planes piloted by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans. As part of the White House response to crack down on Cuba, President Clinton signed the Helms–Burton Act into law.

;Conservative voting record
Burton was a consistently conservative vote in the US House. In the 109th Congress, he had a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee. He also has an A rating with the Gun Owners of America.

Burton has received a number of awards from conservative groups, including a Friend of the Farm Bureau Award in 2004 from the American Farm Bureau Federation, a True Blue Award in 2006 the Family Research Council, eight Guardian of Small Business Awards from the National Federation of Independent Business and twenty-two Spirit of Enterprise Awards from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

;Government Performance and Results Act
Burton was the primary sponsor for a 1998 effort, opposed by the Clinton administration, to require federal government agencies to do more strategic planning, establish more accountability measurements, and do more reporting on their performance. H.R. 2883, the &quot;Government Performance and Results Act Amendments&quot;, was not enacted into law.

;Exposing the Winter Hill Gang/FBI Corruption
In his role as chairman of the House Government Oversight Committee, Burton helped expose FBI corruption that led to the wrongful conviction of Joseph Salvati, Peter Limone, Henry Tameleo and Louis Greco for the murder of Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Deegan. The three-year investigation that Burton spearheaded helped exonerate the four, who were eventually awarded $102 million by Judge Nancy Gertner of the District of Massachusetts.

;Republican Study Committee

Burton served as chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans, during the 101st Congress. After Newt Gingrich yanked funding for the group in 1995, Burton joined fellow congressmen John Doolittle of California, Ernest Istook of Oklahoma and Sam Johnson of Texas in refounding it as the Conservative Action Team. The three men shared the chairmanship from 1994 to 1999. In 2001, the CAT regained its original name, the RSC.

;Pro-Pakistan and Anti-India
Congressman Burton is a founding member and co-chair of Pakistan Caucus in House of Congress. His consistent support for Pakistan and his voting record has prompted the Indian media to describe him as &quot;anti-India&quot; in the past.

Burton has received at least $10,000 in campaign donations from Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, who runs the Kashmir Center, a pro-Pakistan advocacy group. Burton was the chief supporter in Congress of the Kashmiri American Council, until it was revealed to be a front of Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate engaging in illegal lobbying activities on US soil.

;Support for Bahrain&#x27;s monarchy
Burton has been noted for his vocal support of Bahrain&#x27;s monarchy and criticism of protesters during the Bahraini uprising. In April 2012, Burton and his wife took a paid trip to Bahrain to meet with the country&#x27;s rulers. The $20,966 trip was paid for by the pro-monarchy Bahrain American Council, a non-profit group established by and closely linked to Policy Impact Communications, a lobbying firm founded by William Nixon.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Foreign Affairs
**Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific
**Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia (Chairman)
*Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
**Subcommittee on Health Care, District of Columbia, Census and the National Archives
**Subcommittee on National Security, Homeland Defense and Foreign Operations

==Post-Congressional career==
On February 13, 2013, the Azerbaijan America Alliance announced his appointment as Chairman of the group. Burton is listed as chairman on the organization&#x27;s web site as well.

In October 2015, it was reported that Burton registered as a lobbyist on behalf of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), an organization established by the Church of Scientology. CCHR advocates against psychiatry and psychiatric medicine, and is critical of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has been described by critics as a Scientology front group. While not a member of the Church, Burton attended the opening of the Church&#x27;s national office in 2012 and has praised CCHR&#x27;s work in the past.

==Controversies==
===Tainted funds from Pakistan===
In July 2011, Burton was revealed by an FBI investigation to have received tainted election funds ultimately traced to the military intelligence services of Pakistan, apparently as a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for &quot;supporting to Pakistan&#x27;s position on Kashmir&quot;. These funds were routed via the so-called Kashmiri American Council, run by Syed Ghulam Nabi Fai, later revealed to be a front for the Pakistani Military. Subsequently, Burton&#x27;s office donated the funds to charity.

===Vince Foster murder claims===
Burton led the House inquiry into the 1993 death of Vince Foster, the deputy White House counsel to President Bill Clinton who committed suicide, but who Burton believed was murdered. He urged extensive investigation into the possible involvement of the Clintons and gained attention for re-enacting the alleged crime in his backyard with his own pistol and a cantaloupe standing in for Foster&#x27;s head. In 1998, Burton said of Clinton, &quot;If I could prove 10 percent of what I believe happened [regarding the death of Foster], he&#x27;d be gone. This guy&#x27;s a scumbag. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m after him.&quot;

After hearings into Democratic fundraising (see section below) began, a Democratic National Committee staffer appeared in a pumpkin suit with a button that read, &quot;Don&#x27;t shoot&quot;. Burton&#x27;s information during the Whitewater controversy was based on research conducted by Floyd Brown, who founded Citizens United in 1988. Due to problems with the quality of Brown&#x27;s research and testimony, the investigation was closed.

===Golfing===
In 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that in 1989, Burton had been a &quot;celebrity player&quot; at the Bob Hope Classic in Palm Springs, California, the Kemper Open in Potomac, Maryland, the Larry Bird Golf Classic in Indianapolis, the Danny Thompson Memorial Tournament in Sun Valley, Idaho, the Sugarloaf Invitational tournament in Maine and the Arte Johnson Tournament in Chicago. Such players received free airline flights, free meals, and free lodging from tournament sponsors and, often, free merchandise.

In November 1995, the House voted to prohibit members and their staffs from receiving gifts, including free meals and free travel to charity sports events. Burton, who led the effort to exempt charity trips, said that he played in two golf tournaments each year, and, &quot;We get more of these lobbyists in our office than we do on the golf course.&quot;

In January 1997, Burton played in the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, at the invitation of AT&amp;T Corporation, the tournament sponsor. The day before the tournament, he played a practice round with Robert E. Allen, AT&amp;T&#x27;s chairman and chief executive, at a nearby country club. AT&amp;T also hosted a campaign fund-raising dinner for Burton at a local restaurant. Three weeks earlier, Burton had become the chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, which had jurisdiction over the legislative agency scheduled to soon award at least $5 billion in long-distance and local telephone and telecommunications contracts with the federal government. Burton defended his participation in the tournament, saying it would not affect his objectivity when dealing with telecommunications issues. He said that he had partially paid for the trip, with his re-election campaign funds paying as well because he attended three fund-raising events while in California.

In December 2004, Burton and two aides flew to the island of Guam. The trip was paid for by the Guam government and tourism industry. In addition to some official events, including touring a military facility, Burton played in a charity golf tournament. After he returned, he tried to help Guam&#x27;s tourism industry get a sought-after change in visa rules.

In January 2007, the House passed a measure by a vote 430–1 that banned members from accepting gifts and free trips from lobbyists and discounted trips on private planes. Burton cast the sole nay vote.

In February 2007, a review by &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; of votes in the House of Representatives for the past decade showed that Burton had missed all votes during the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic golf tournament for five years between 2001 and 2007. The tournament, the third event each season on the PGA Tour, pairs celebrities with golf professionals for four of the five days of play. Since 2004, Burton has played in a guest spot of the Eisenhower Medical Center, the primary charitable beneficiary of the event. The slot carries with it a commitment to donate $10,000 to the event; Burton has made arrangements with the hospital to do this over a period of time. Burton&#x27;s campaign committee reported donating $1,500 to the medical center in December 2004 and $6,353 in January 2006.

&quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; review also found that in 2006, Burton ranked last in voting among members of Congress from Indiana, missing 11 percent of the 541 recorded votes. In 2007, &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; rated his voting record as &quot;one of the strongest in the House, with an attendance record consistently above 95%.&quot;

===&quot;... off the coast of Bolivia&quot;===
On March 29, 1995, during congressional hearings on the US War on Drugs, Burton proclaimed that the US military &quot;should place an aircraft carrier off the coast of Bolivia and crop dust the coca fields.&quot; It was later pointed out to him that (a) Bolivia is landlocked and has no coast (Burton was chairman of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee); (b) the Bolivian coca fields (in the yungas and Amazon lowlands) are beyond the reach of any carrier-borne crop-duster, being separated from the nearest coastline (the Pacific coast of Peru and Chile) by the 20,000+ feet high peaks of the Andes; and (c) F-18s cannot crop-dust. While criticism of this misstatement was muted in Washington, it sparked a major anti-American backlash in Bolivia, derailing the same War on Drugs that Burton purported to be speaking for.

===Investigation of Democratic Party fund-raising===

In 1997, Burton headed an investigation into possible Democratic Party campaign finance abuse, focusing on the 1996 presidential election. The committee investigation ran for several years and issued over 1,000 subpoenas of Clinton administration officials and cost over $7 million. The committee, and Burton&#x27;s leadership, were labeled a &quot;farce&quot;, a &quot;travesty&quot;, a &quot;parody&quot;, and &quot;its own cartoon, a joke, and a deserved embarrassment&quot;.

In March 1997, as the investigation began, Burton was accused of demanding a $5,000 contribution from a Pakistani lobbyist. The lobbyist said that when he was unable to raise the funds, Burton complained to the Pakistani ambassador and threatened to make sure &quot;none of his friends or colleagues&quot; would meet with the lobbyist or his associates.

In May 1998, Burton apologized for releasing edited transcripts of prison audiotapes of Webster Hubbell, a former associate of President Bill Clinton. The edited transcripts omitted substantial information and differed significantly from the original recordings. Burton was harshly criticized by members of his own party, including Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who called the investigation a &quot;circus&quot; and chided Burton for initially refusing to admit any error.

David Bossie, the staff member who arranged the editing and release of the tapes, resigned on Burton&#x27;s request. Noting that Burton had personally released the tapes and had supported Bossie&#x27;s plans over the objections of other committee staffers and attorneys, Democrats urged Burton to step down as well. Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt said, &quot;A committee staff member should not be made the scapegoat for Chairman Burton&#x27;s mistakes, missteps, and misdeeds.&quot; Burton said, &quot;I take responsibility for those mistakes&quot;, but never resigned nor faced any consequences for his actions.

In President Clinton&#x27;s final year in office, Burton was mentioned in a short film for the White House Correspondent&#x27;s Dinner. &quot;President Clinton: Final Days&quot;, which depicted Clinton as a lonely man closing down a nearly-deserted White House. Clinton is shown hitting golf balls from the South Lawn, and gets excited when he hits a car parked in a spot near the U.S. Capitol that says &quot;Reserved for Chairman Burton&quot;.

===Autism===

Burton has been an outspoken critic of what he terms the failure of government to determine the cause of an alleged autism epidemic. When his grandson began to show the signs of autism shortly after receiving vaccinations, Burton inferred the relationship to be causal: &quot;My only grandson became autistic right before my eyes – shortly after receiving his federally recommended and state-mandated vaccines.&quot;

Burton was instrumental in pressuring the National Institutes of Health to launch a five-year, $30 million study of chelation therapy for cardiovascular disease.

In an October 25, 2000, letter to the Department of Health and Human Services, acting in his role as chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform, Burton asked the agency&#x27;s director to get the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to recall all vaccines containing the preservative Thimerosal. &quot;We all know and accept that mercury is a neurotoxin, and yet the FDA has failed to recall the 50 vaccines that contain Thimerosal&quot;, Burton wrote, adding &quot;Every day that mercury-containing vaccines remain on the market is another day HHS is putting 8,000 children at risk.&quot;

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not agree that vaccines containing mercury caused autism, and the US FDA refused to ban the vaccines. Most manufacturers removed the preservatives from their vaccines anyway, with no resulting decrease in autism rates.

Burton maintained a page on his Congressional website called House.gov &quot;Autism&quot; which includes his speeches, transcripts from hearings, and newspaper articles on the relationship of autism and vaccines.

In a June 2017 episode of &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; a C-SPAN 2 clip from 2002 of Dan Burton was used to highlight Burton&#x27;s position on vaccines in relation to autism. In the clip Burton says, &quot;I have yet to find any scientist who will say that there is no doubt, no doubt, that the mercury in vaccines does not contribute to autism. Now they&#x27;ll say there&#x27;s no scientific evidence, there&#x27;s no studies or anything that proves that yet. But turn that around. There are no studies that disprove it either.&quot; John Oliver correctly highlights this as Burton&#x27;s demand for &quot;proving a negative&quot; which he calls &quot;an impossible standard&quot;.

===Constituent mailings===
An Arizona newspaper study ranked Burton as the fifth-biggest user of free congressional mail, sending constituents more than $190,000 worth of mail in 2007.

===Daughter===
In June 2007, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported that during the 2001–2006 period, Burton&#x27;s campaign fund had paid $143,900 to his daughter Danielle Sarkine, who manages his campaign office. It is not illegal for federal candidates to pay family members for political work, as long as they are paid fair market value, the Federal Election Commission has ruled.

===Sibel Edmonds testimony===
On January 6, 2008, FBI whistleblower Sibel Edmonds included Dan Burton&#x27;s photograph among others featured in the &quot;State Secrets Privilege Gallery&quot; posted on her website, composing images of figures considered to be relevant to her case. Later, on August 8, 2009, she gave sworn testimony about Burton and others during a witness deposition before the Ohio Elections Commission in the &quot;Schmidt v. Krikorian&quot; case, in which she stated that he had engaged in &quot;[E]xtremely illegal activities against the United States citizens ... and against the United States&#x27; interests&quot; that involved covert operations by foreign governments and entities, but did not further elaborate on these activities, ostensibly due to the limitations applied by the State Secrets Privilege.

===ADA===
On October 2, 1989, Representative Dan Burton took to the floor of the house to argue against the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). He stated &quot;The ADA is a last ditch attempt of the remorseless sodomy lobby to achieve its national agenda before the impending decimation of AIDS destroys its political clout. Their Bill simply must be stopped. There will be no second chance for normal America if the ADA is passed.&quot;

==Personal life==
Burton&#x27;s first wife, Barbara (Logan) Burton, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1993 at the age of 56. She died in 2002 from breast and colon cancer. They had three children together: Kelly, Danielle and Danny. In August 2006, Burton married Dr. Samia Tawil in Park City, Utah. She was the internist who cared for Burton&#x27;s wife during her cancer treatment. Tawil and her first husband had divorced in 2005.

In 1995 speaking of the then recent affairs of Republican Robert Packwood and the unfolding story of Paula Jones and Bill Clinton, Burton stated &quot;No one, regardless of what party they serve, no one, regardless of what branch of government they serve, should be allowed to get away with these alleged sexual improprieties&quot;. A vocal critic of Clinton, he went on to say, &quot;Above all, Dan Burton believes the people have a right to principled leadership and that character does matter&quot;. Three years later in 1998, the magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was to print an article detailing an affair which Burton himself had in 1983 which had produced a child. Before publication, Burton was forced to admit to fathering a son with a former state employee out of wedlock in 1983.

Burton&#x27;s brother, Woody Burton, is a former Republican member of the Indiana House of Representatives, representing District 58.

Burton is a member of the board of advisors of the Institute on Religion and Public Policy. Burton is a 33° Scottish Rite Freemason, and a member of Evergreen-Oriental Lodge No. 500 in Indianapolis, Indiana.

He established Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders (BIRDEM), the diabetes health-care and research institute complex in 1980. The Government of Bangladesh awarded him National Professor and the Independence Day Award in 1978.

==Education==
Ibrahim earned MBBS degree from Calcutta Medical College in 1938. He became MRCP in 1949. He was made a Fellow of College of Chest Physicians (FCCP) in 1950.

== Career ==
Ibrahim established Diabetic Association of Pakistan (later Diabetic Association of Bangladesh) on 28 February 1956. He also founded Diabetic Association in Karachi and Lahore, West Pakistan, in 1964.

Ibrahim established the diabetes health-care and research institute complex, BIRDEM at Dhaka in 1980 where the out-patients centre of the Bangladesh Diabetic Association was shifted to. The institute is housed in two buildings, named the Ibrahim Memorial Diabetes Centre after his death in 1989. In recognition of its innovative, extensive and high quality service it was designated in 1982 as a &quot;WHO-Collaborating Centre for Developing Community-oriented Programs for Prevention and Control of Diabetes.&quot; It is the first such centre in Asia. He established the Bangladesh Institute of Research and Training for Applied Nutrition (BIRTAN) and Rehabilitation and Vocational Training Centre (RVTC) in Dhaka to develop low-cost nutrition, and to give vocational training to poor and unemployed diabetics.

<doc id="391304" wikidata="Q829331" url="?curid=391304" title="Berzerk (video game)">
<text>Berzerk is a video game designed by Alan McNeil and released for arcades in 1980 by Stern Electronics of Chicago. The game involves a Humanoid Intruder who has to escape maze-like rooms that are littered with robots that slowly move towards and shoot at the Humanoid. The player can shoot at the robots to try and escape the room. Along with the robots, a smiley face known as Evil Otto appears to hunt down the player within each room.

Following a task to fix some technical problems on boards, Stern allowed McNeil to develop his own game. He slowly developed a game initially with robots, later adding the walls and the Evil Otto character to expand on the gameplay. After the company was visited by a salesperson promoting a &quot;speech chip&quot;, McNeil took the offer and incorporated digitized voices in the game that taunt the player during game play and attract mode. Along with games like &quot;Stratovox&quot; (1980), it was one of the earliest games to feature speech synthesis in arcade games.

Stern premiered the game at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) exposition in Chicago in late 1980. Upon release, the arcade game shifted 15,000 units. The game went on to receive ports for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200 and the Vectrex home consoles. The ports of the game were generally received well by the video game press, with the Atari 2600 port of the game winning a Certificate of Merit award for &quot;Best Solitaire Videogame&quot; from &quot;Electronic Games&quot;.

McNeil developed a sequel titled &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1982). &quot;Berzerk&quot; was influential on later games such as &quot;&quot; (1982). The game appeared on various &quot;best of&quot; lists and articles from publications like &quot;Flux&quot; in 1995, GameSpy in 2002, and &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; in 2008.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Berzerk&quot; is a one or two-player game. Darran Jones of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; retrospectively described its genre as both a maze and shooter. The object of &quot;Bezerk&quot; is to have the Humanoid Intruder shoot as many robots as possible and escape a maze-like room. At the beginning of each room, the humanoid appears at the middle of one of the four edges and can escape through the exits on another side of the area.

The rooms are littered with robots that move slowly and periodically shoot at the player. The robots can fire in eight directions. The player shoots in the direction of the joystick in one of the eight directions the joystick is placed in. The joystick also controls the Humanoid intruder&#x27;s movement. The player cannot move while firing. Bonus points are awarded when each room full of robots is destroyed. A smiley face known as &quot;Evil Otto&quot; will enter from where the Humanoid entered a room eventually and cannot be destroyed. Evil Otto can move through walls and follows the Humanoid Intruder trying to defeat it. Being shot by the robots, touching a maze wall, or having the Intruder touch either Evil Otto or a robot will result in the player losing a life.

DIP switches are available in the arcade machine for the operator to adjust some gameplay elements. This allows options to allow the player to get an extra life at 5,000 points, 10,000 points or not at all.
By 1981, two models of &quot;Berzerk&quot; existed. The first featured three different coloured robots, with the yellow robots who do not shoot bullets, red robots that fire one shot at a time, and white robots that shoot two shots at a time. The next model featured all the previous robots, as well as purple robots that could shoot three or five shots at a time, yellow robots that shoot four shots at a time, and a white robot that can shoot one very fast shot.

==Development==
Alan McNeil developed &quot;Berzerk&quot; for Stern Electronics. McNeil enjoyed games like Stratego and Mille Bornes when younger; he became interested in network-based video games through the PLATO computer system. After college, he made some games on his Sol-20 computer, such as an adaptation of &quot;Chase&quot;, a game that originated on the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System that later appeared as a type-in listing in &quot;Creative Computing&quot;, &quot;Kilobaud Microcomputing&quot;, &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; and David Ahl&#x27;s book &quot;More BASIC Computer Games&quot;. How McNeil encountered &quot;Chase&quot; is unclear: while he remembered seeing the game in &quot;Byte&quot;, it never appeared as a type-in listing in that publication. McNeil found work at Dave Nutting Associates, where he programmed the coin-op sequels &quot;Boot Hill&quot; and &quot;Sea Wolf II&quot; and ported &quot;Gun Fight&quot; to the Bally Professional Arcade. Tired of working on ports and sequels, McNeil requested permission to create an original video game, but management refused to let him, citing his lack of game design experience. Therefore, he began looking for work elsewhere.

McNeil found new work at Stern Electronics in 1979 with the promise that, after he could fix a problem on a Bally controller board, he could develop a video game. Stern was starting to get involved in video games, which led to McNeil doing the artwork, graphics design, programming and debugging of the game himself.
 He quickly developed a prototype of the game on his Tektronix development system. The first prototype of the game was influenced by &quot;Chase&quot;, such as the theme of robots attempting to kill the player and the robots vanishing if they crashed into each other. He used Fred Saberhagen&#x27;s series &quot;Berserker&quot; for the title of the game, as the novels are about robot war machines that are out to kill all biological life forms. He said in an interview that developing the concept for the game was simple, but described actually making the game as &quot;drudge work&quot;, and that it took no fewer than 33 separate programs to make &quot;Berzerk&quot; work.

McNeil wanted the average game to last about three minutes for a novice player. In his initial version, McNeil said, he&#x27;d made the robots move too quickly, which made the game become &quot;too hard, even with just six robots; the game favored the robots too much - they would crash into each other occasionally, but the average game time on one life was about six seconds - not good.&quot; He tweaked the robots&#x27; speeds and adjusted the number of bullets they could shoot as a player entered a new room. Also, initially, the walls in the rooms in the game were not entirely random, which McNeil felt was not immersive. He altered the game so that rooms had a seed generator based on certain x and y co-ordinates within the code.

To incentivize a player to leave a room once the robots were defeated, McNeil created the &quot;Evil Otto&quot; character, a bouncing happy face. McNeil stated that he despised the happy-face icon and believed its associated phrase, &quot;Have a nice day&quot;, was used by &quot;people who didn&#x27;t want you to have a nice day, but instead wanted to cover themselves in fake righteousness. So I showed it like it was: &#x27;have a nice day while I beat you to death!&#x27;&quot;. He named the character after Nutting Associates office manager Dave Otto, who enacted several office policies that annoyed the engineers. 

During the game, the enemy robots speak audible threats, warnings, and insults whether a player fights or flees the room. McNeil said that the game originally had what he described as &quot;pinball-type sounds&quot;, but this was changed when a salesman visited during the development of the game. The salesman was selling a &quot;speech chip&quot;; the chip was intended to assist people with visual impairments, but the company was trying to expand into toys and games, and, on finding that the voice sounded very robotic, McNeil used it for &quot;Berzerk&quot;.
The speech chip used custom hardware to make hisses and tones that could be assembled into words. McNeil kept the phrases short and applied them to the game to taunt players. He also included phrases for attract mode.

The last major addition was in the final month of production: making the game in color instead of black and white. As a black and white game, Berzerk was originally designed with translucent ink applied to the monitor screen to make it appear to be in color. To make the game truly colored, company engineers created a four-bit color overlay video layer.

==Release==

Stern premiered the game at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) exposition in Chicago which ran between October 31 to November 2, 1980. The show had a total attendance of 7,400 visitors. &quot;Cashbox&quot; reported that the show visitors would daily crowd into &quot;Berzerk&quot;″s booth for a chance to play it. Early test models for &quot;Berzerk&quot; had large joysticks, which had to be replaced by standard one-inch-high models created by the Wico Corporation. McNeil said that they changed the joysticks as players were pulling down so hard on them, that the cabinet would tip onto them.

&quot;Berzerk&quot; began shipping in November 1980, and Stern manufactured 15,000 units. McNeil commented that &quot;some games would be played out in a month because kids would get easily bored with them, but they always came back to &quot;Berzerk&quot;. &quot;Pac-Man&quot; eventually spelled the end of &quot;Berzerk&quot;″s dominance, but even then it was earning well for operators.&quot;

The success of &quot;Berzerk&quot; in arcades led to versions made for Atari consoles and the Vectrex. &quot;Berzerk&quot; was released for the Atari 2600 in August 1982, the Vectrex in October 1982, and the Atari 5200 in February 1984. The port for the Atari 2600 was developed by Dan Hitchens. McNeil disliked the ports, finding that the games looked cruder than the arcade original, and responded that &quot;Stern Electronics had sold the rights to make the home game to Atari for 4 million dollars - intellectual property capitalism at its finest.&quot;

==Reception==

Tony Licata, David Pierson, and Dick Welu covered the arcade games presented at AMOA in &quot;Play Meter&quot; magazine.
Pierson found &quot;Berzerk&quot; interesting and commented that the major hindrance on the game was the controls involving the player having to use joystick for both aiming and movement. Welu wrote that the Stern&#x27;s game did not look attractive, it was still his vote for the best of the show. He complimented the inclusion of Evil Otto and concluded that &quot;people won&#x27;t be able to quit playing [&quot;Berzerk&quot;].&quot; Licata listed Atari&#x27;s &quot;Battlezone&quot; (1980) as his pick for the best in the show, while stating that &quot;Berzerk&quot; was another game that really stood out. He described the synthesized voices in the game and its attract mode as highlights while and praising the graphics, writing that they fit perfectly for the game without detracting from it.

An anonymous reviewer in &quot;Electronic Games&quot; wrote that following Atari&#x27;s announcement to release a version of &quot;Berzerk&quot; for the Atari 2600, &quot;skepticism ran rampant&quot; that the arcade game would be hard to produce for the system, particularly concerning the poor critical reception for the Atari home console version of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1982). Reviews in the magazines &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot;, &quot;The Video Game Update&quot;, &quot;JoyStik&quot; and &quot;Video Review&quot; all found the game strong port of the arcade game, with &quot;Electronic Games&quot; saying that it was &quot;one of the best arcade-to-home translations any company has produced thus far.&quot;
&quot;Electronic Fun with Computers &amp; Games&quot;, &quot;Electronic Games&quot; and &quot;JoyStik&quot; all complimented the variety in the mazes in the games which added variety to the game. &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; also complimented the sounds and visuals, specifically when the Humanoid is electrified by robot fire or by walking into walls. While the Atari 2600 version was described as &quot;generally well regarded&quot; by Grannell, McNeil was not keen on the conversions, finding they lacked many of the original game&#x27;s refinements.

In the magazine &quot;TV Gamer&quot;, the publication did not include &quot;Berzerk&quot; as one of the best games for the Vectrex system while concluding that &quot;Berzerk&quot; translated &quot;surprisingly well&quot; as a Rasterscan despite Evil Otto not looking right, being mostly made up of straight lines. Video game critic Michael Blanchet found the visuals on the Atari 5200 version of the game as simple which he said he would normally criticize, but found them approrpriate for &quot;Berzerk&quot;. He found the main drawback was the Atari 5200 controller, which was not as responsive as it could be.

At the 1983 Arcade Awards from &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, along with &quot;Infiltrate&quot; (1982), the Atari VCS version of &quot;Berzerk&quot; won the Certificate of Merit award for &quot;Best Solitaire Videogame&quot;, being beaten by the ColecoVision release of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; (1981).

===Retrospective===

Brett Weiss of AllGame praised the original arcade game for its humor, long-term replayability and its difficulty. Weiss also gave a positive review of the 5200 port reiterating his points, while finding that the humanoid controlled a bit too slow. A review in &quot;Eurogamer&quot; for the arcade version said that the game lives up to its name, and that its &quot;quintessential surrealism makes it almost impossible not to love the game, and any entertainment medium that makes its audience regularly laugh out loud is worth a place in the top 50.&quot;
&quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; found that the game did not have a lot of variety, but was fun nonetheless. Matt Fox in his book &quot;The Video Games Guide&quot; (2012) gave the game three stars finding the graphics &quot;simple but effective&quot; and that it was satisfying to have the robots chase you blindly only to destroy themselves against the walls of the maze.

In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the arcade version of &quot;Berzerk&quot; at 55th place on their list of the top 100 video games of all time. In their &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; article on the game, William Cassidy of GameSpy highlighted that the digitized speech as innovative and complimented the game&#x27;s personality. He found the game tapped into a science fiction and horror archetype which was only presented better in &quot;&quot; (1982) and declared that Evil Otto was one of the greatest video game villains of all time. &quot;IGN&quot; echoed this, stating that while the character was generally unknown to a younger generation of gamers, Evil Otto was one of the most well-known video game villains during the &quot;Atari days&quot;.

In their list of the top 25 Atari 2600 games in 2008, Stuart Hunt and Darran Jones of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; included &quot;Berzerk&quot; on their list. The reviewers commented that it was the best &quot;run-&#x27;n&#x27;-gun&#x27;&quot; game on the Atari 2600 and complimented the animation in the game, specifically the rotating eyes of the cycloptic robots as &quot;menacing and really instilled a feeling that they&#x27;re scanning the room for a fleshy to kill.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Player death===
On April 3, 1982, an 18-year-old male named Peter Burkowski of South Holland, Illinois, entered Friar Tuck&#x27;s Game Room in nearby Calumet City, Illinois. After playing and beating the high score in &quot;Berzerk&quot;, he collapsed and was pronounced dead the same day. Reports in newspapers suggested that officials were investigating if the player&#x27;s heart attack was due to the stress endured while playing the game. Mark Allen, the deputy coroner said that the autopsy found was due to a scar tissue in his heart which was at least two weeks old, and said that &quot;it&#x27;s possible that the stress of the games triggered the attack in Peter&#x27;s weakened heart.&quot; The owner of the Friar Tuck&#x27;s, Tom Blankly said that the player&#x27;s heart &quot;had a Time Bomb in it that just happened to go off here. I expected it to hurt business, but if anything, business has been up.&quot;

Rumours spread since the death of the player that other players had died since playing &quot;Berzerk&quot;, which McNeil denied. McNeil responded that the owner of Friar Tucks said that the player ran up the stairs to play the game, was out of breath the moment he arrived and collapsed before even finishing his game.

===Influence and follow-ups===
Along with &quot;Stratovox&quot; (1980) and &quot;Taskete&quot; (1980), &quot;Berzerk&quot; was one of the earliest examples of speech synthesis in arcade games. Video game critic Michael Blanchet said &quot;Berzerk&quot; was one of the first games to combine shoot &#x27;em up with maze game mechanics and the first to be a &quot;not-so-cute maze game, and it is still the best.&quot; &quot;Berzerk&quot; had influenced various video games following its release such as Eugene Jarvis&#x27; &quot;Robotron: 2084&quot;. Jarvis described &quot;Berzerk&quot; as being &quot;amazing&quot; and on discovering that if you held down the shooting button, the player would not move, but could still change the direction they fired their weapon. This led him to design the game &quot;Robotron: 2084&quot; with a second joystick to control the firing direction. McNeil said &quot;I talked to [the developers of the Robotron: 2084] Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar when I was considering working for Williams. They are both great guys. I remember Eugene saying that Berzerk irritated them and they wanted to modify it to include some tougher situations. That was the itch they scratched for Robotron. I&#x27;m the same way. Something will irritate me and I&#x27;ll want to improve it or redesign it.&quot; &quot;Berzerk&quot; was also described by authors of &quot;Vintage Games&quot; (2009) as the unstated inspiration for &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; (1981). McNeil&#x27;s game also had various clone games, such as &quot;Thief&quot; (1981).

Mike Mika developed an Atari 2600 homebrew version of &quot;Berzerk&quot; which included the digitized voice that was initially made available in 2002. Mika stated that the original game was of his favorite games for the system and when teaching himself how to program for the Atari 2600, he began adjusting palette colors in the games and began testing audio and to apply to it. Other members of the Atari homebrew community such as Dennis Debro dissembled the original game and found code for the robots to shoot diagonally like in the arcade game, which was later added to &quot;Berzerk: Enhanced&quot;. &quot;Berzerk: Enhanced&quot; was released as a physical Atari 2600 cartridge by Atari in 2023.

McNeil said he left Stern following a stressful period where he was in charge of eight programmers, was interviewed during a period where items were being stolen from the company, and that on asking for a raise from his boss, received a response that &quot;the designer of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) had merely &#x27;got a watch and liked it&#x27; and said [McNeil] should do the same.&quot; Before quitting, he was offered one last project to make a sequel to &quot;Berzerk&quot;. As he had leftover ideas that did not make it into the original game, McNeil accepted and developed the game &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1982). Following &quot;Berzerk&quot;, McNeil made a handful of other games before focusing on work in animation programming. He died in 2017 of a heart attack.

In 2023, Atari, Inc. announced that they have acquired the rights to Stern&#x27;s arcade games, including &quot;Berzerk&quot;. Sneakybox developed a new &quot;Berzerk&quot; game titled &quot;Berzerk: Recharged&quot; (2023) that was published by Atari as part of their Atari Recharged series. &quot;Berzerk&quot; was re-released as downloadable content for the &quot;Atari 50&quot; (2022) compilation, which included the arcade version, the 5200 version, and both the original and voice-enhanced versions for the Atari 2600.

<text>Mark Edward Souder (July 18, 1950 – September 26, 2022) was an American politician and businessman from Indiana. A Republican, he was a U.S. Representative from 1995 to 2010.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, he worked as a congressional aide and committee staff director to Dan Coats. He was elected to his congressional seat in 1994, and remained in office until he resigned in May 2010, after admitting to an affair with a female staff member.

==Early life and career==
Souder was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, the son of Irma (née Fahling) and Edward G. Souder, on July 18, 1950. He grew up in Grabill, Indiana, and was educated at Leo Junior/Senior High School, Indiana University–Purdue University Fort Wayne and the University of Notre Dame. While in college, he was a member of the Young Americans for Freedom. After graduating from college, Souder worked as a marketing manager and small business owner. He was a member of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ.

From 1974 to 1976, Souder served as marketing manager for Gabbort&#x27;s Furniture. From 1976, he was the owner of Souder&#x27;s General Store, also known as Historic Souder&#x27;s of Grabill. Souder served as an aide for United States Representative Dan Coats from 1983 to 1984; as minority staff director of the House Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families from 1985 to 1988; and again as an aide for Coats from 1988 to 1993, staying with Coats when the latter became a United States Senator in 1989. He was a staff director on the United States House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families.

==Congressional career==

Souder was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican in November 1994, defeating Coats&#x27; successor in Congress, Democrat Jill Long, in that year&#x27;s national Republican landslide. He was re-elected in every election thereafter until his resignation in 2010. It was the only elected office he ever held. He originally ran on a signed pledge with America that he would not serve more than two additional terms. He was regarded as a staunch advocate of abstinence education and family values.

Souder was the Ranking Member on the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Maritime, and Global Counterterrorism. He was also a senior member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee. Along with U.S. Rep. Brian Baird (D-WA), he was co-founder and co-chairman of the Congressional National Parks Caucus. He was also co-founder and co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Drug Policy. Until the start of the 110th Congress, Souder was chairman of the House Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources.

In November 1997, Souder was one of eighteen Republicans in the House to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal would ultimately lead to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Souder voted in favor of legislation that was passed to open an impeachment inquiry. On December 19, 1998, Souder voted in favor of one (and against three) of the four proposed articles of impeachment against Clinton (only two of which received the majority of votes needed to be adopted). The only article of impeachment that Souder voted in favor of adopting was the third article, which charged Clinton with obstruction of justice.

In March 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, which represented the most comprehensive anti-methamphetamine legislation ever passed by Congress. Souder authored much of this law, which targets meth trafficking at local and state, national, and international levels.

In December 2006, Bush signed into law the ONDCP Reauthorization Act, which Souder had authored and introduced. The law reauthorizes the office of &quot;the Drug Czar&quot; for five years.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Homeland Security
**Subcommittee on Border, Maritime and Global Counterterrorism (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment
*Committee on Education and Labor
**Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education
**Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning, and Competitiveness
*Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
**Subcommittee on Domestic Policy (Vice Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Federal Workforce, Post Office, and the District of Columbia
*Co-founder and Co-chairman of the National Parks Caucus

===Resignation===
On May 18, 2010, Souder announced he would resign from Congress effective Friday, May 21, after admitting to an affair with Tracy Meadows Jackson, a married female staffer. He and Jackson had made a television video in which they both extolled the virtues of abstinence. In a written statement released that morning, Souder said:

It is with great regret I announce that I am resigning from the U.S. House of Representatives as well as resigning as the Republican nominee for Congress in this fall&#x27;s election. ... I sinned against God, my wife and my family by having a mutual relationship with a part time member of my staff. I am so shamed to have hurt those I love.

Souder deviated from his written statement when reading it aloud to the Fort Wayne press later in the morning to explain why, unlike many legislators admitting adultery, he did not have his wife of 30 years at his side:

I&#x27;m sick of politicians who drag their spouses up in front of the cameras rather than confronting the problem they caused.

==Political positions and actions==
Souder said that an actual voting record in Congress is more valuable than claimed positions on issues. His 1994 issues profile is available in the project archives. The American Conservative Union gave him a lifetime rating of 90%.

===Influence of religion===
In 2004, Souder said in an interview that &quot;the closer to the clearness of the Bible, the less ability I should have to compromise. So I view, on abortion, there&#x27;s really not much room to compromise.&quot; He said, regarding Israel, &quot;[T]he bottom line is, they&#x27;re God&#x27;s chosen people. He&#x27;s going to stand with them. The question is: Are we going to stand with them?&quot; Souder applied for non-combatant status during the Vietnam War on religious grounds. His draft number was never called.

===Illegal drugs===
Souder supported the War on Drugs. He authored and advocated for the 1998 Aid Elimination Penalty (HEAEP), an amendment to the Higher Education Act. The provision suspends eligibility for federal financial aid to college students convicted of drug-related offenses, regardless of when those drug convictions occurred. By 2006, the law had interfered with the financial aid of more than 9,000 Indiana students (one in every 200 applicants from that state). In almost all cases, the suspensions of eligibility for aid were based on applicants checking a box saying that they had a drug conviction, or failing to check the box saying that they do not, rather than an actual check of criminal records. Following an amendment in 2006, only students who are enrolled in college and receiving financial aid at the time of their conviction could have their aid suspended. Students could resume eligibility after a period of time (for example, after one year if convicted of possession of a controlled substance) or if they complete a drug rehabilitation program approved by the U.S. Department of Education. Before the 2006–2007 academic year, the provision could also apply to high school students, but this changed with the passage of the Deficit Reduction Act in 2001. A 2013 research report by the National Bureau of Economic Research found the law had no impact on drug usage among young people, and that it acts as a strong deterrent to college attendance, severely limiting the ability of people to better their lives through education.

In early 2006, Souder added to a bill about the office of the drug czar, a provision calling for the fungus &quot;Fusarium oxysporum&quot; to be used as a biological control agent against drug crops in foreign countries. Several federal and state agencies have previously rejected such use of the fungus because it is highly prone to mutation.

===Online poker===
Souder advocated a federal prohibition of online poker. In 2006, he cosponsored , the Goodlatte–Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act and , the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.

===Kelty endorsement===
In October 2007, in the Fort Wayne, Indiana mayoral race, Souder endorsed fellow Republican Matt Kelty. Souder, however, withdrew his official support for Kelty in October 2007 because of Kelty&#x27;s campaign finance law problems and a birthday cake frosted with a crude joke which was given to Kelty by several Republicans and garnered controversy. Souder said that the joke cake was &quot;immature&quot;.

==Election history==

In his initial campaign for Congress in 1994, Souder pledged his support for term-limit legislation. He served four terms (1995–2003) representing Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district. In 2002, after redistricting based on the 2000 census, Souder was elected to represent Indiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district.

In 2004, the 3rd district re-elected Souder 69%–31% against Maria Parra. In the 2006 general election, Souder&#x27;s Democratic opponent was Fort Wayne City Councilman and military veteran Tom Hayhurst, an MD. Souder won 54% to 46%, carrying all eight counties in his congressional district.

In 2008, Souder was re-elected to an eighth term in the U.S. House. Souder defeated Democrat Mike Montagano and Libertarian William Larsen.



Souder&#x27;s resignation prompted the 2010 Indiana&#x27;s 3rd congressional district special election, which coincided with that year&#x27;s regular elections. Souder was succeeded by Republican Marlin Stutzman.

==Later life==
After his resignation, Souder and his wife, Diane, returned to their home in rural Allen County, Indiana. He co-wrote a book about the history of local television in Fort Wayne, which was published in 2021. He also wrote columns for the website &quot;Howey Politics Indiana&quot;.

Souder was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January 2022. He died of the disease on September 26, 2022, at age 72.

<text>Eighty Eight is an unincorporated community in Barren County, Kentucky, United States. It is part of the Glasgow Micropolitan Statistical Area and is 10 miles east of Glasgow on State Highway 90. The community held celebrations on August 8, 1988 (08/08/88) and August 8, 2008 (08/08/08).

== Name ==
As reported in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the community was named in 1860 by Dabnie Nunnally, the community&#x27;s first postmaster. He had little faith in the legibility of his handwriting, and thought that using numbers would solve the problem. He then reached into his pocket and came up with 88 cents. Another explanation is that the hamlet is 8.8 miles from Glasgow.

The only store in this small community was opened and run by the Richardson Brothers. It was the main source for feed, grocery, hardware and farm needs. It was closed in the late 1980s. The building was restored in 2005 and reopened as the Eighty Eight General Store. The historic post office (Zip Code 42130) was kept intact and is now open to the public. It is no longer in service however and was discontinued in 1984.

== Culture ==
Eighty Eight is home to a congregation of the Church of Christ. Although sometimes mistakenly called Eighty Eight Church of Christ, the proper name is Refuge Church of Christ.

<text>The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) is an international center for research and education in biological and environmental science. Founded in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, in 1888, the MBL is a private, nonprofit institution that was independent for most of its history, but became officially affiliated with the University of Chicago on July 1, 2013. It also collaborates with numerous other institutions.

As of 2024, 63 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with MBL as students, faculty members or researchers. In addition, since 1960, there have been 137 Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators, early career scientists, international researchers, and professors; 319 members of the National Academy of Sciences; and 260 Members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who have been affiliated with the lab.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The Marine Biological Laboratory grew from the vision of several Bostonians and Spencer Fullerton Baird, the United States&#x27; first Fish Commissioner (a government official concerned with the use of fisheries). Baird had set up a United States Fish Commission research station in Woods Hole in 1882, and had ambitions to expand it into a major laboratory. He invited Alpheus Hyatt to move his marine biology laboratory and school which he had founded at the Norwood-Hyatt House in Annisquam, Massachusetts, to Woods Hole. Inspired by Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz&#x27;s short-lived experimental summer school, the Anderson School of Natural History on Penikese Island, off the coast of Woods Hole, Hyatt accepted the offer. With $10,000 raised by the Woman&#x27;s Education Association of Boston and the Boston Society of Natural History, land was purchased, a building was erected, and the MBL was incorporated with Hyatt as the first president of the board of trustees. The Fish Commission supplied crucial support, including marine organisms and running sea water.
University of Chicago professor, Charles Otis Whitman, an embryologist, was retained to also serve as the first director of the MBL. Whitman believed &quot;other things being equal, the investigator is always the best instructor,&quot; and emphasized the need to combine research and education at the new laboratory. The MBL&#x27;s first summer course provided a six-week introduction to invertebrate zoology; facilities for visiting summer investigators were also offered.

The MBL Library was established in 1889, with scientist and future MBL trustee Cornelia Clapp serving as librarian. In 1899, the MBL began publishing &quot;The Biological Bulletin&quot;, a scientific journal that is still edited at the MBL.

Gertrude Stein, later well known as a novelist and art collector, took part in MBL&#x27;s Embryology course in the summer of 1897, while her brother Leo took part in the Invertebrates course.

=== 20th century ===

Writing in 1972, Lewis Thomas both explained and praised the nature of the MBL as a scientific institution. He wrote about it in his recurring &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; column called &quot;Notes of a Biology-Watcher&quot;, in an installment called &quot;The MBL&quot;; the essay was later collected into the volume titled &quot;The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher&quot;. He said of the MBL of that day, &quot;Today, it stands as the uniquely national center for biology in this country; it is the National Biological Laboratory without being officially designated (or yet funded) as such. Its influence on the growth and development of biologic science has been equivalent to that of many of the country&#x27;s universities combined, for it has had its pick of the world&#x27;s scientific talent for each summer&#x27;s research and teaching. […] Someone has counted thirty Nobel Laureates who have worked at the MBL at one time or another. It is amazing that such an institution, exerting so much influence on academic science, has been able to remain so absolutely autonomous. It has, to be sure, linkages of various kinds, arrangements with outside universities for certain graduate programs, and it adheres delicately, somewhat ambiguously, to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution just up the street. But it has never come under the domination of any outside institution or governmental agency, nor has it ever been told what to do by any outside group. […] There is no way of predicting what the future will be like for an institution such as the MBL. One way or another, it will evolve. It may shift soon into a new phase, with a year-round program for teaching and research and a year-round staff, but it will have to accomplish this without jeopardizing the immense power of its summer programs, or all institutional hell will break loose. It will have to find new ways for relating to the universities, if its graduate programs are to expand as they should. It will have to develop new symbiotic relations with the Oceanographic Institute, since both places have so much at stake. And it will have to find more money, much more — the kind of money that only federal governments possess — without losing any of its own initiative. It will be an interesting place to watch, in the years ahead.&quot;

=== 21st century ===

The MBL became formally affiliated with the University of Chicago on July 1, 2013. In order to further scientific research and education, the affiliation builds on historical ties with the university, as MBL was led by University of Chicago faculty members in its first four decades. The president of the university chairs the MBL trustee&#x27;s board and with their advice appoints its members. The Laboratory is a non-profit Massachusetts corporation, whose sole member is the university.

In September 2018, Nipam Patel became director of the Marine Biological Laboratory, succeeding Huntington F. Willard.

== Research ==

=== Staff ===
The MBL has approximately 250 year-round employees, about half of which are scientists and scientific support staff. They are joined each year by more than 500 visiting scientists, summer staff, and research associates from hundreds of institutions around the world, as well as a large number of faculty and students participating in MBL courses (in 2024, 550 students from 273 institutions and 58 countries).

=== Facilities ===
The MBL&#x27;s resident research centers are the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, the Ecosystems Center, and the Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution]. Visiting scientists are affiliated with the MBL&#x27;s Whitman Center. Whitman Center Scientists comprise more than 100 principal investigators from academic institutions around the world. Other resources include The Marine Resources Center, an advanced facility for maintaining, culturing, and providing aquatic and marine organisms essential to biological, biomedical, and ecological research; and The National Xenopus Resource, which breeds and maintains Xenopus (frog) genetic stocks; and provides training in Xenopus husbandry, cell biology, imaging, genetics, transgenesis, and genomics.

The MBL shares a library, the MBLWHOI Library, with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The MBLWHOI Library holds print and electronic collections in the biological, biomedical, ecological, and oceanographic sciences, and houses a growing archival collection, including photograph and videos from the MBL&#x27;s history. The library also conducts digitization and informatics projects.

=== Research ===
Research at the MBL focuses on four themes:

* fundamental biological research, often using marine organisms as novel model systems, encompassing research in regenerative biology, neuroscience, sensory physiology, and comparative evolution and genomics;
* the study of microbiomes and microbial diversity and ecology in a variety of ocean and terrestrial habitats;
* imaging and computation;
* ecosystems science and climate change, and organismal adaptation to changing environments.

==== Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology ====
Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology have been a central part of the MBL&#x27;s programs since the 1890s. Important discoveries in these fields at the MBL reach back to 1899, when Jacques Loeb demonstrated artificial parthenogenesis in sea urchin eggs; to 1905, when Edwin Grant Conklin first identified egg cytoplasmic regions that are programmed to form certain tissues or organs; to 1916, when Frank Rattray Lillie identified circulating hormones that influence sexual differentiation (Lillie, 1944). In the MBL&#x27;s first two decades, cytologists Edmund Beecher Wilson, Nettie Stevens and others made connections between the chromosomes and Mendelian heredity, while Wilson&#x27;s colleague at both the MBL and Columbia University, Thomas Hunt Morgan, launched the field of experimental genetics (Pauly, 2000:158). Keith R. Porter, considered by many to be a founder of modern cell biology due to his pioneering work on the fine structure of cells, including the discovery of microtubules, carried out research at the MBL starting in 1937 and directed the laboratory from 1975-77 (Barlow et al., 1993: 95-115).

The MBL is also a proving ground for new technologies in microscopy and imaging. MBL Distinguished Scientist Osamu Shimomura, who joined the MBL in 1983, was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the early 1960s, which led to the development of revolutionary techniques for imaging live cells and their components. Resident Distinguished Scientist Shinya Inoué&#x27;s innovations in polarized light microscopy and video imaging since the 1950s have been instrumental in clarifying the cellular events of mitosis, including his discovery of the spindle fibers.

In the early 1980s, Tim Hunt, Joan Ruderman and others at the MBL identified the first of a class of proteins that regulate the cycle of cell division (cyclin). Hunt was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2001 for this work (Hunt, 2004). In 1984, Ron Vale, Michael Sheetz, Joe DeGiorgis, and others discovered kinesin, a motor protein involved in mitosis and other cellular processes, during summer MBL research. Vale, Sheetz, and James Spudich received the 2012 Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their discoveries related to molecular motors. In 1991 Israeli scientist Avram Hershko began coming to the MBL to study the role that the protein ubiquitin plays in cell division. In 2004, Hershko won a Nobel Prize for his work to establish the basic mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

A large portion of the leading developmental biologists in the United States, both historically and today, have participated in the MBL&#x27;s Embryology Course as directors, lecturers or students. One draw is the Woods Hole location and the availability of marine organisms, particularly the sea urchin, that are ideal for embryological analysis because they shed nearly transparent eggs which are fertilized and develop externally. In the first decades after the course was founded in 1893, its faculty pioneered research directions that remain central today, including the study of cytoplasmic localization in eggs; embryonic cell lineage (important in modern stem cell research); and evolutionary developmental biology (today called &#x27;evo devo&#x27;). Some distinguished embryologists who have directed or co-directed the course are:
*Charles Otis Whitman (1893–1895)
*Frank Rattray Lillie (1896–1903)
*Viktor Hamburger (1942–1945)
*James D. Ebert (1962–1966)
*Eric H. Davidson (1972–1974; 1988–1996)
*Rudolf Raff (1980–1982) (see Davidson, 1993)
*Michael Levine (1992–1996)
*Marianne Bronner (1997–2001)
*Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado and Richard Behringer (2012–2016)
*Carole LaBonne (2020–present)

==== Regenerative biology and medicine ====
In 2010, the MBL established the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, where researchers study the ability of marine and other animals to spontaneously regenerate damaged or aging body parts. An understanding of tissue and organ regeneration in lower animals holds promise for translation to treatments for human conditions, including spinal cord injury, diabetes, organ failure, and degenerative neural diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s. A cornerstone of the Bell Center is a national resource for research on the frog, Xenopus, which is a major animal model used in U.S. biomedical research. The National Xenopus Resource at the MBL is funded by the National Institutes of Health (MBL Facts).

==== Neuroscience, neurobiology, and sensory physiology ====
The MBL&#x27;s contributions to neuroscience and sensory physiology are significant, fostered today by more than 65 visiting investigators and resident researchers in these fields, as well as five graduate- and post-graduate level Advanced Research Training courses. The MBL has been a magnet for the discipline since L.W. Williams in 1910 discovered, and John Zachary Young in 1936 rediscovered, the squid giant axon, a nerve fiber that is 20 times larger in diameter than the largest human axon. Young brought this locally abundant, ideal experimental system to the attention of his MBL colleague KS Cole, who in 1938 used it to record the resistance changes underlying the action potential, which provided evidence that ions flowing across the axonal membrane generate this electrical impulse. In 1938, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin came to the MBL to learn about the squid giant axon from Cole. After World War II, Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley, working in Plymouth, England and using the voltage clamp technique developed by Cole, laid the basis for the modern understanding of electrical activity in the nervous system by measuring quantitatively the flow of ions across the axonal membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley received the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their description of the ionic basis of nerve conduction (Barlow et al., 1993: 151-172). Following on Hodgkin and Huxley&#x27;s work, in the 1960s and 1970s Clay Armstrong and other MBL researchers described a number of the properties of the ion channels that allow sodium and potassium ions to carry electric current across the cell membrane and Rodolfo Llinas described the transmission properties at the squid giant synapse (Llinas 1999). The &quot;scientific career&quot; of the &quot;Woods Hole squid&quot;, &quot;Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii&quot;, continues today, with studies on axonal transport, the squid giant synapse, squid genomics, and the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Other marine organisms draw neuroscientists and neurobiologists to the MBL each summer, where a history of research into sensory physiology and behavior has been established. Haldan Keffer Hartline, an MBL summer investigator in the 1920s and early 1930s, uncovered several basic mechanisms of photoreceptor function through his studies on the horseshoe crab. Hartline shared the 1967 Nobel Prize with summer MBL colleague George Wald, who described the molecular basis of photoreception by showing that the light-sensitive rhodopsin consists of retinal, a slightly modified form of vitamin A, coupled to a photoreceptor protein. Another long-term summer investigator, Stephen W. Kuffler, is credited with &quot;founding&quot; the science of neurobiology in the mid-1960s at Harvard Medical School and he also initiated instruction in neurobiology at the MBL (Barlow et al., 1993:175-234; 203-234). Albert Szent-Györgyi (Nobel Laureate in 1937) conducted research at the MBL from 1947 to 1986, most significantly on the biochemical nature of muscular contraction. In the 1950s and 1960s, Frederik Bang and Jack Levin at the MBL discovered that the blood of the horseshoe crab clotted when exposed to bacterial endotoxins even in vanishingly small amounts. From this basic research, a reagent, Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL), was developed that can detect minute amounts of bacterial toxins. The LAL test has resulted in dramatic improvement in the quality of drugs and biological products for intravenous injection.

==== Ecosystems science ====
Ecosystems research became a year-round commitment at the MBL in 1962 with the founding of the Systematics-Ecology program, under the direction of Melbourne R. Carriker. In 1975, the MBL&#x27;s Ecosystems Center was established, with George Woodwell as director. The original research focus was on the global carbon cycle, an emphasis maintained today. The Ecosystems Center has a year-round staff of more than 40 scientists who study a variety of ecosystems and their responses to human activities and environmental changes. The center is located in Woods Hole yet has a global reach, with active research sites in the Arctic tundra; in forest, coastal and marine sites in New England, Sweden and Brazil. The Ecosystems Center is home to two of the 26 U.S. Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites: Toolik Lake, Alaska; and Plum Island, Massachusetts. Scientists in the Ecosystems Center study the effects of forest clearance and land-use change on atmospheric chemistry, watershed processes and coastal ecology, the global-scale anthropogenic enrichment of the nitrogen cycle, and ecosystem responses to global warming. The interim director of the Ecosystems Center is Anne Giblin. Former directors of the Center who are still active on the scientific staff are Jerry Melillo, who studies the biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems, and John Hobbie, a microbial ecologist. The Ecosystems Center is founded on a vision of collaborative, interdisciplinary science; shared lab facilities and instrumentation; and a long-term, large-scale, systems-wide view of ecosystem processes.

==== Comparative genomics, molecular evolution, and microbial ecology ====
The Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution was founded at the MBL in 1997 and is currently directed by David Mark Welch. By comparing diverse genomes, scientists at the center are elucidating the evolutionary relationships of biological systems, and describing genes and genomes of biomedical and environmental significance. Microorganisms found in a wide range of ecosystems, including the human microbiome, are studied. Mitchell Sogin, the Bay Paul Center&#x27;s founder, also founded two courses at the MBL: the Workshop in Molecular Evolution; and Strategies and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures. In 2003-2004, Sogin launched the International Census of Marine Microbes, a global effort to describe the biodiversity of marine micro-organisms. Early results from this census in 2006 revealed some 10 to 100 times more types of marine microbes than expected, and the vast majority are previously unknown, low-abundance microorganisms now called the &quot;rare biosphere&quot;. Other Bay Paul Center projects are focused on microbes that live in extreme environments, from hydrothermal vents to highly acidic ecosystems, which may lead to a better understanding of life that could exist on other planets. Activities at the Bay Paul Center are supported by advanced DNA sequencing and other genomics equipment at the center&#x27;s Keck Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics Facility.

== Education program ==
The MBL offers a range of courses, workshops, conferences, and internships throughout the year. Central to its programs are more than 20 Advanced Research Training Courses, graduate-level courses in topics ranging from physiology, embryology, neurobiology, and microbiology to imaging and computation integrated with biological research.

In addition, the MBL hosts courses for undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Chicago and other colleges and universities, as well as workshops and conferences—accommodating more than 2,600 participants in 2016.

<text>Peter John Visclosky ( ; born August 13, 1949) is an American politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1985 until his retirement in 2021. He is a member of the Democratic Party and was the dean of the Indiana congressional delegation before his retirement in 2021. The District lies in Northwest Indiana, and includes most of the Indiana side of the Chicago metropolitan area. Redistricting passed by the Indiana General Assembly in 2011 changed the district&#x27;s boundaries, effective January 2013, to include all of Lake and Porter counties as well as the western and northwestern townships of LaPorte County, while shifting Benton, Newton, and Jasper counties out of the district.

On November 6, 2019, Visclosky announced that he would not seek re-election in 2020.

==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==
Visclosky was born in Gary, Indiana, the son of John and the late Helen (née Kauzlaric) Visclosky. He is of Croatian-Slovak descent. He was educated at Andrean High School in Merrillville, Indiana. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting at Indiana University Northwest in Gary, Indiana and went on to earn his juris doctor from Notre Dame Law School. At Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., Visclosky earned a Master of Laws in International and Comparative Law. He worked as a lawyer and staff member of United States Representative Adam Benjamin before entering the House.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1984, Visclosky ran for Congress in Indiana&#x27;s 1st congressional district. In the Democratic primary, he defeated incumbent U.S. Congresswoman Katie Hall, Jack Crawford, and Sandra Smith 34%-33%-31%-1%. In the general election, he defeated Republican Joseph Grenchik 71%-29%. He was reelected 17 times from a district that has been in Democratic hands without interruption since 1931.

In 1986, he won the Democratic primary again with 57%, defeating Hall and three other candidates. He won the general election with 73% of the vote. In 1988, he won the Democratic primary 84%-16% against Sandra Smith. He went on to win the general election with 77% of the vote.

In 1990, Hall challenged Visclosky for the third time and was defeated 51%-30%. He won the general election with 66% of the vote. In 1992, he won the Democratic primary with 72% and the general election with 69%. In 1994, he won the Democratic primary with 77% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Republican John Larson 56%-44%.

For the rest of his career, he never won a primary with less than 71% and he only once won a general election with less than 60% of the vote - in 2010, when Republicans re-took control of the House of Representatives.

===Tenure===

Visclosky is pro-union and anti-free trade. Reinstating the steel tariff, fighting against illegal actions known as &quot;Steel Dumping&quot;, in which countries undercut American steel prices by subsidizing steel production, and/or producing steel through nationalized steel companies, which artificially manipulates the market price of steel produced in this manner, a violation of trade agreements, free markets, and certain international laws, and fighting to save American manufacturing jobs have long been priorities of Visclosky. He serves as Chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus when the Democrats have control of the House, and serves as Vice Chair when they don&#x27;t. He is also a former Chair of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee and the current Ranking Member. Congressman Visclosky also opposed actions that would have certain components of advanced U.S. Military weapons and hardware made in foreign countries, most notably in China, which caused the closing of U.S.-based manufacturing centers, such as &quot;Magnequench&quot; in Valparaiso, Indiana, which was covered heavily in the media, most notably in printed media from his district, namely &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Post Tribune&quot;, both servicing Northwest Indiana. In this particular case, the component was a sophisticated, high-tech magnet, made of rare earth metals, that is an integral part of U.S. smart-bombs and guided missile systems, including the &quot;Joint Direct Attack Munition&quot; or &quot;JDAM&quot;.

Visclosky is one of the 126 Democrats who voted against the Iraq War Resolution. He is also a supporter of high tech solutions as a way to revive the American blue collar work force, and as a way to decrease crime.

Visclocsky was a prime proponent of expanding Gary/Chicago International Airport&#x27;s runway, and played a role in the securing of $58 million in federal funding to do so in 2006.

===Indiana&#x27;s Lake Michigan shoreline===
During his tenure, one of Visclosky&#x27;s focuses had been improving Indiana&#x27;s Lake Michigan shoreline.

In 1985, during his first term, Visclosky proposed the &quot;Marquette Plan&quot;, which would have seen 75% of Northwest Indiana&#x27;s industrial shoreline reclaimed for public uses. Two decades later, he revived the proposal in a revised form, as the &quot;Marquette Greenway&quot;, which would have seen bike trails built along the lakefront. While the overall &quot;Marquette Plan&quot; has not been realized, a number of projects have reclaimed some of the industrial lakefront, such as the Portage Lakefront and Riverwalk.

In 2019, Visclosky added a measure making Indiana Dunes a United States National Park to an appropriations bill, which passed into law. Indiana Dunes thereby became the 61st National Park.

===South Shore Line improvements===
A large focus of Visclosky during his tenure was improving the South Shore Line rail service. Visclosky managed to help secure federal funding for a number of improvements to the South Shore Line throughout his tenure, including funding for new overpasses and bridges. In his last term as a congressman, two major projects Visclosky had long advocated for to improve the South Shore Line, double tracking on the existing main branch and the construction of the new West Lake Corridor, received federal funding.

===PMA Group investigation===
The &quot;Washington Times&quot; reported in March 2009 that Visclosky had received, over ten years, $1.36 million in campaign donations from clients of the PMA Group. In 2007 and 2008, the United States House Committee on Appropriations, of which Visclosky is a member, directed $137 million in government purchasing to PMA&#x27;s clients. In May 2009, Visclosky received subpoenas in the grand jury investigation into PMA Group, the first member of Congress to be subpoenaed in the investigation. The Congressman was later cleared of all charges by the House Ethics Committee, who detailed in a 305-page report that &quot;Simply because a member sponsors an earmark for an entity that also happens to be a campaign contributor does not, on these two facts alone, support a claim that a member&#x27;s actions are being influenced by campaign contributions&quot;.

Steven V. Roberts and Cokie Roberts called the Visclosky/PMA/Sierra Nevada Corporation relationship &quot;a bribe by any other name&quot;.

In 2011, the House Ethics Committee ended its investigation, clearing Visclosky and Republican former Representative Todd Tiahrt of Kansas. While &quot;PMA&#x27;s lobbyists pushed or directed company executives to maximize personal or Political Action Committee (PAC) campaign contributions and to attend specific fundraisers while pursuing earmarks,&quot; the report notes, &quot;the evidence did not show that Members or their official staff were included in discussions or correspondence about, coordinated with PMA on, or knew of these strategies.&quot;

<text>Antivenom, also known as antivenin, venom antiserum, and antivenom immunoglobulin, is a specific treatment for envenomation. It is composed of antibodies and used to treat certain venomous bites and stings. Antivenoms are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity. The specific antivenom needed depends on the species involved. It is given by injection.
Side effects may be severe. They include serum sickness, shortness of breath, and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Antivenom is traditionally made by collecting venom from the relevant animal and injecting small amounts of it into a domestic animal. The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal&#x27;s blood and purified.

Versions are available for spider bites, snake bites, fish stings, and scorpion stings. 
Due to the high cost of producing antibody-based antivenoms and their short shelf lives when not refrigerated, alternative methods of production of antivenoms are being actively explored. One such different method of production involves production from bacteria. Another approach is to develop targeted drugs (which, unlike antibodies, are usually synthetic and easier to manufacture at scale).
Antivenom was first developed in the late 19th century and came into common use in the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Antivenom is used to treat certain venomous bites and stings. They are recommended only if there is significant toxicity or a high risk of toxicity. The specific antivenom needed depends on the venomous species involved.

In the US, approved antivenom, including for pit viper (rattlesnake, copperhead and water moccasin) snakebite, is based on a purified product made in sheep known as CroFab. It was approved by the FDA in October 2000. U.S. coral snake antivenom ceased production, and remaining stocks of in-date antivenom for coral snakebite expired in fall 2009, leaving the U.S. without a coral snake antivenom. However, as of July 2021, Pfizer has indicated that antivenom is available. Efforts are being made to obtain approval for a coral snake antivenom produced in Mexico which would work against U.S. coral snakebite, but such approval remains speculative.

As an alternative when conventional antivenom is not available, hospitals sometimes use an intravenous version of the antiparalytic drug neostigmine to delay the effects of neurotoxic envenomation through snakebite. Some promising research results have also been reported for administering the drug nasally as a &quot;universal antivenom&quot; for neurotoxic snakebite treatment.

A monovalent antivenom is specific for one toxin or species, while a polyvalent one is effective against multiple toxins or species.

The majority of antivenoms (including all snake antivenoms) are administered intravenously; however, stonefish and redback spider antivenoms are given intramuscularly. The intramuscular route has been questioned in some situations as not uniformly effective.

==Side effects==
Antivenoms are purified from animal serum by several processes and may contain other serum proteins that can act as immunogens. Some individuals may react to the antivenom with an immediate hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylaxis) or a delayed hypersensitivity (serum sickness) reaction, and antivenom should, therefore, be used with caution. Although rare, severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis to antivenom are possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.4103/0972-5229.164807&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this caution, antivenom is typically the sole effective treatment for a life-threatening condition, and once the precautions for managing these reactions are in place, an anaphylactoid reaction is not grounds to refuse to give antivenom if otherwise indicated. Although it is a popular myth that a person allergic to horses &quot;cannot&quot; be given antivenom, the side effects are manageable, and antivenom should be given rapidly as the side effects can be managed.

==Method of preparation==
Most antivenoms are prepared by freeze drying (also called cryodesiccation or lyophilization). The process involves freezing the antisera, followed by application of high vacuum. This causes frozen water to sublimate. Sera is reduced to powder with no water content. In such an environment, microorganisms and enzymes cannot degrade the antivenom, and it can be stored for up to 5 years [at normal temperatures]. Liquid antivenoms may also be stored for 5 years, but they must be stored at low temperatures (below 8 °C/46 °F).

==Mechanism==
Antivenoms act by binding to and neutralizing venoms. The principle of antivenom is based on that of vaccines, developed by Edward Jenner; however, instead of inducing immunity in the person directly, it is induced in a host animal and the hyperimmunized serum is transfused into the person. The host animals may include horses, donkeys, goats, sheep, rabbits, chickens, llamas, and camels. In addition, opossums are being studied for antivenom production. Antivenoms for medical use are often preserved as freeze-dried ampoules, but some are available only in liquid form and must be kept refrigerated. They are not immediately inactivated by heat, however, so a minor gap in the cold chain is not disastrous.

==History==
The use of serum from immunized animals as a treatment for disease was pioneered in 1890 by Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato, who first demonstrated that the infectious diseases diphtheria and tetanus could be prevented or cured using transfusions from an immune animal to a susceptible one. On February 10, 1894, Albert Calmette at the Pasteur Institute, and independently Césaire Auguste Phisalix and Gabriel Bertrand at the National Museum of National History in France, announced that they had achieved the same result—treatment of a vulnerable animal with serum from an immunized one—this time using snake venom as the source of protection and disease. Calmette went on subsequently to immunize horses using venom from Indian cobras, and the resulting &quot;Serum Antivenimeux&quot; (antivenomous serum) became the first commercially-available antivenom product.

Natural immunity of snakes to their own venom was observed at least as long ago as 1767, by Felice Fontana in his work &quot;Ricerche Fisiche sopra il Veleno della Vipera&quot; (Physical Research on the Venom of the Viper). Surgeon-Major Edward Nicholson wrote in the November 1870 Madras Medical Journal that he had witnessed a Burmese snake-catcher inoculating himself with cobra venom. However, the snake-catcher was unsure whether this was actually effective and therefore continued to treat his snakes with care. Nicholson, along with other Britons, began to consider that venom might provide its own cure. Although Scottish surgeon Patrick Russell had noted in the late 18th century that snakes were not affected by their own venom, it was not until the late 19th century that Joseph Fayrer, Lawrence Waddell, and others began to consider venom-based remedies again. However, they and other naturalists working in India did not have the funding to fully develop their theories. In 1895 Sir Thomas Fraser, Professor of Medicine at the University of Edinburgh, picked up Fayrer and Waddell&#x27;s research to produce a serum to act against cobra venom. His &quot;antivenene&quot; was effective in the laboratory, but failed to make an impact as the public were focused on contemporary Pasteurian discoveries.

In 1901, Vital Brazil, working at the Instituto Butantan in São Paulo, Brazil, developed the first monovalent and polyvalent antivenoms for Central and South American &quot;Crotalus&quot; and &quot;Bothrops&quot; genera, as well as for certain species of venomous spiders, scorpions, and frogs. In Mexico in 1905, Daniel Vergara Lope developed an antivenom against scorpion venom, by immunizing dogs. In Australia, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) began antivenom research in the 1920s. CSL has developed antivenoms for the redback spider, funnel-web spiders and all deadly Australian snakes. In the USA, the H.K. Mulford company began producing &quot;Nearctic Crotalidae antivenin&quot; in 1927, via a consortium called the Antivenin Institute of America.

Over time, a variety of improvements have been made in the specificity, potency, and purity of antivenom products, including &quot;salting out&quot; with ammonium sulphate or caprylic acid, enzymatic reduction of antibodies with papain or with pepsin, affinity purification, and a variety of other measures. Many equine facilities now use plasmapheresis to collect blood plasma instead of blood serum.

==Availability==
There is an overall shortage of antivenom to treat snakebites. Because of this shortage, clinical researchers are considering whether lower doses may be as effective as higher doses in severe neurotoxic snake envenoming.

Antivenom undergoes successive price markups after manufacturing, by licencees, wholesalers and hospitals. When weighed against profitability (especially for sale in poorer regions), the result is that many snake antivenoms, world-wide, are very expensive. Availability, from region to region, also varies.

Internationally, antivenoms must conform to the standards of pharmacopoeia and the World Health Organization (WHO). 

In 2024 researchers have discovered a synthetic antibody that can neutralize a key type of neurotoxin produced by four different deadly snake species from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. This might be a step toward an antivenom that could be used on any of the 200 or so dangerous venomous snakes throughout the world.

Antivenoms have been developed for the venoms associated with the following animals:

===Spiders===
===Acarids===
===Insects===
===Scorpions===
===Marine animals===
===Snakes===

==Terminology==

The name &quot;antivenin&quot; comes from the French word , meaning venom, which in turn was derived from Latin , meaning poison.

Historically, the term &quot;antivenin&quot; was predominant around the world, its first published use being in 1895. In 1981, the World Health Organization decided that the preferred terminology in the English language would be &quot;venom&quot; and &quot;antivenom&quot; rather than &quot;venin&quot; and &quot;antivenin&quot; or &quot;venen&quot; and &quot;antivenene&quot;.

<text>Key/Config-authentication is used to solve the problem of authenticating the keys of a person (say &quot;person A&quot;) that some other person (&quot;person B&quot;) is talking to or trying to talk to. In other words, it is the process of assuring that the key of &quot;person A&quot;, held by &quot;person B&quot;, does in fact belong to &quot;person A&quot; and vice versa.

This is usually done after the keys have been shared among the two sides over some secure channel. However, some algorithms share the keys at the time of authentication. 

The simplest solution for this kind of problem is for the two concerned users to communicate and exchange keys. However, for systems in which there are a large number of users or in which the users do not personally know each other (e.g., Internet shopping), this is not practical. There are various algorithms for both symmetric keys and asymmetric public key cryptography to solve this problem.

==Authentication using Shared Keys==
For key authentication using the traditional symmetric key cryptography, this is the problem of assuring that there is no man-in-the-middle attacker who is trying to read or spoof the communication. There are various algorithms used now-a-days to prevent such attacks. The most common among the algorithms are Diffie–Hellman key exchange, authentication using Key distribution center, kerberos and Needham–Schroeder protocol. Other methods that can be used include Password-authenticated key agreement protocols etc.

==Authentication using Public Key Cryptography==
Crypto systems using asymmetric key algorithms do not evade the problem either. That a public key can be known by all without compromising the security of an encryption algorithm (for some such algorithms, though not for all) is certainly useful, but does not prevent some kinds of attacks. For example, a spoofing attack in which public key &quot;A&quot; is claimed publicly to be that of user Alice, but is in fact a public key belonging to man-in-the-middle attacker Mallet, is easily possible. No public key is inherently bound to any particular user, and any user relying on a defective binding (including Alice herself when she sends herself protected messages) will have trouble.

The most common solution to this problem is the use of public key certificates and certificate authorities (CAs) for them in a public-key infrastructure (PKI) system. The certificate authority (CA) acts as a &#x27;trusted third party&#x27; for the communicating users and, using cryptographic binding methods (e.g., digital signatures) represents to both parties involved that the public keys each holds which allegedly belong to the other, actually do so. A digital notary service, if you will. Such CAs can be private organizations providing such assurances, or government agencies, or some combination of the two. However, in a significant sense, this merely moves the key authentication problem back one level for any CA may make a good faith certification of some key but, through error or malice, be mistaken. Any reliance on a defective key certificate &#x27;authenticating&#x27; a public key will cause problems. As a result, many people find all PKI designs unacceptably insecure.

Accordingly, key authentication methods are being actively researched.

<doc id="391323" wikidata="Q4223" url="?curid=391323" title="Julian McMahon">
<text>Julian Dana William McMahon (born 27 July 1968) is an Australian-American actor. He is the only son of Sir William McMahon, a former Prime Minister of Australia. He is best known for his roles as Ben Lucini in &quot;Home and Away&quot;, Detective John Grant in &quot;Profiler&quot;, Cole Turner in &quot;Charmed&quot;, Christian Troy in &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, Doctor Doom in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; duology, Jonah in &quot;Runaways&quot;, and Jess LaCroix in CBS crime drama &quot;&quot;. For his performance in &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, McMahon was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Television Drama Series.

==Early life==
McMahon was born in Sydney, the son of Sir William McMahon, a prominent Australian politician, and Lady McMahon (née Sonia Hopkins), an heiress, socialite and fashion icon. His father was a Member of the Australian House of Representatives and a high-ranking minister in the 24-year Liberal Government for many years before Julian&#x27;s birth; he became the 20th Prime Minister of Australia in March 1971, when Julian was two years old. His mother left their three children in the care of a nanny to be with her husband in Canberra during his Prime Ministership. He has an older sister, Melinda, and a younger sister, Deborah. He is of Irish descent through his father.

In an interview with the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; in 2018, McMahon discussed his childhood: &quot;My Dad... was born in 1908. That’s a very different time to what it was when he was raising me. He must have gone through a strange misunderstanding of how you were parented in 1908 versus how you parent in 1972; it would have been so conflicting. Also how you be a husband in that period of time would have been different.&quot;

McMahon was educated at the private, boys-only, Sydney Grammar School, which his father had attended. As a child he dreamed of being an army cadet and playing rugby. McMahon briefly studied law at the University of Sydney and economics at the University of Wollongong. McMahon found no interest in his studies, and began a modelling career. He became known as a model in various fashion capitals, such as Milan, London, New York City, Rome, and Paris.

McMahon was working in Europe when his father died, and returned to Australia for the funeral. While home, he filmed some Levi&#x27;s commercials which helped him land a role on the iconic Australian soap opera &quot;Home &amp; Away&quot;.

==Career==
McMahon won recognition for his roles in television dramas, in portrayals of Ben Lucini in the Australian soap opera &quot;Home and Away&quot; (1989–1991), Detective John Grant in the American crime drama &quot;Profiler&quot; (1996–2000), Cole Turner in the American supernatural drama &quot;Charmed&quot; (2000–2003), and Christian Troy in the American medical drama &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; (2003–2010). He also appeared in films with leading and supporting roles, such as &quot;Chasing Sleep&quot; (2000) alongside Jeff Daniels, Doctor Doom in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; franchise (2005 and 2007), &quot;Premonition&quot; (2007) starring alongside Sandra Bullock, &quot;Red&quot; (2010) alongside Bruce Willis, &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot; (2011) alongside Milla Jovovich&quot;,&quot; and &quot;Bait&quot; (2012) alongside Dan Wyllie and Xavier Samuel.

In the early 1990s, McMahon struggled to obtain a work permit for the United States and as a result he missed out on a few roles. McMahon&#x27;s big break Hollywood role was on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; when he was cast as Ian Rain in 1993. The first scene he shot in New York for the show had him emerge from a pool in a speedo at the Cory Mansion. He remembers the experience as &quot;pretty magical&quot;.

McMahon&#x27;s work in television, particularly with &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; and &quot;Charmed&quot; garnered him more success. The former series won an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award. McMahon played the lead role in &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, alongside Dylan Walsh throughout the entire series&#x27; run. He also played Jonah on &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Runaways&quot;.

In 2018, McMahon returned to Australia to film &quot;Swinging Safari&quot; in Queensland, alongside Guy Pearce, Kylie Minogue, Radha Mitchell, Asher Keddie, and Jeremy Sims. The film is set in the 1970s and sees McMahon sport a handlebar moustache. McMahon and his ex-sister-in-law Kylie Minogue share an improvised kiss in a scene where couples partner swap. He stated that he found it difficult speaking with an Australian accent in the film because the majority of his career he has adapted to performing with an American accent.

From 2020 to 2022, McMahon starred as Jess LaCroix in the CBS crime drama &quot;&quot;. He stated that when he received the script for the series from CBS, he had an &quot;aha moment&quot; and knew he had to play the character. He also made guest appearances in parent series &quot;FBI&quot; and in spin-off &quot;&quot;. McMahon departed the series mid-way through the third season; his final episode, &quot;Shattered&quot;, aired 8 March 2022.

Most of McMahon&#x27;s roles have been villains or damaged characters which he says he feels attracted to.

==Personal life==
McMahon jokingly noted in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel that his mother [was] &quot;a very scary lady&quot; because she would visit him on the set of his films and critique his performance when he finished a scene.

In 1994, McMahon married singer Dannii Minogue after meeting on the set of &quot;Home and Away&quot; in 1991. He starred in her music video clip for the single &quot;This Is It&quot;, a song that summed up the couple&#x27;s relationship and hopes for the future. The newlyweds spent a great deal of their marriage apart, due to McMahon pursuing his career in Los Angeles and Minogue in England. They divorced after 18 months with Minogue stating that her negative relationship with McMahon&#x27;s mother, Sonia, Lady McMahon, being an issue from the beginning.

In 1999, McMahon married &quot;Baywatch&quot; star Brooke Burns and had a daughter in June of 2000 before the couple divorced in 2001. McMahon married for the third time in 2014 to Kelly Paniagua.

McMahon has resided in the United States since the 1990s, but says his soul is still Australian: &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m Australian on the inside and American on the outside or something. I would never want to leave it behind either. I love Australians, Australianisms, I love my part of being Australian. I love where I grew up and how I grew up and, you know, I wouldn&#x27;t change it for the world.&quot;

<text>Michael Richard Pence (born June 7, 1959) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the 48th vice president of the United States from 2017 to 2021 under President Donald Trump during his first administration. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as the 50th governor of Indiana from 2013 to 2017, and as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from 2001 to 2013.

Born and raised in Columbus, Indiana, Pence graduated from Hanover College and then from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law before entering private practice. He lost two House bids in 1988 and 1990 and was a conservative radio and television talk show host from 1994 to 1999. After being elected to the House in 2000, Pence represented Indiana&#x27;s from 2001 to 2003 and from 2003 to 2013. He chaired the Republican Study Committee from 2005 to 2007 and House Republican Conference from 2009 to 2011. He was elected governor of Indiana in 2012.

As governor, Pence initiated the largest tax cut in Indiana&#x27;s history and pushed for more funding for private education initiatives. He signed bills intended to restrict abortions, including one that prohibited abortions if the reason for the procedure was the fetus&#x27;s race, gender, or disability, and required funerary services for terminated fetuses, including those resulting from miscarriage; this law was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge and prevented from going into effect. After Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, he encountered resistance from moderate members of his party, the business community, and LGBT advocates. The backlash against the bill led Pence to approve changes to the law to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and other criteria. 

Pence became the running mate of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who won the 2016 presidential election. As vice president, Pence chaired the National Space Council following its reestablishment in 2017 as well as the White House Coronavirus Task Force, which was established in early 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pence and Trump lost their bid for re-election in the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, although Trump refused to concede, made false or unproven allegations of election fraud, and filed numerous unsuccessful lawsuits in multiple states. Despite Trump&#x27;s urging to overturn the election results and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Pence oversaw the certification of Biden and Harris as the winners of the election.
Pence has since distanced himself from Trump, endorsing candidates in primary elections in opposition to those supported by Trump and criticizing Trump&#x27;s conduct on the day of the Capitol attack. In June 2023, he launched a bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, but withdrew by the end of October. He chose not to endorse Trump in the general election. Trump chose JD Vance as his vice-presidential candidate.

==Early life and education==

Pence was born on June 7, 1959, in Columbus, Indiana, one of six children of Ann Jane &quot;Nancy&quot; Cawley and Edward Joseph Pence Jr., who ran a group of gas stations. His father served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War and received the Bronze Star in 1953, which Pence displays in his office along with its commendation letter and a reception photograph. His father was of German and Irish descent, and his mother is of Irish ancestry. His paternal grandfather, Edward Joseph Pence Sr., worked in the Chicago stockyards. He was named after his maternal grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who emigrated from Dooncastle, Ireland, to the United States through Ellis Island and who became a bus driver in Chicago, Illinois. His maternal grandmother&#x27;s parents were from Doonbeg, County Clare, Ireland.

Pence graduated from Columbus North High School in 1977. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from Hanover College in 1981, and a Juris Doctor from the Robert H. McKinney School of Law at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis in 1986. While at Hanover, he joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, becoming the chapter president. After graduating from Hanover, he was an admissions counselor at the college from 1981 to 1983.

In his childhood and early adulthood, Pence was a Roman Catholic and a Democrat, as was the rest of his family. He volunteered for the Bartholomew County Democratic Party in 1976 and voted for Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, and has said he was originally inspired to get involved in politics by people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. While in college, Pence left the Catholic Church and became an evangelical, born-again Christian, to the disappointment of his mother. His political views also started shifting to the right during this time, something which Pence attributes to the &quot;common-sense conservatism of Ronald Reagan&quot; with which he began to identify.

==Early career and congressional campaigns==

After graduating from law school in 1986, Pence was an attorney in private practice. In 1988, he ran for Congress against Democratic incumbent Philip Sharp, but lost. He ran against Sharp again in 1990, quitting his job in order to work full-time in the campaign, but once again was unsuccessful. During the race, Pence used &quot;political donations to pay the mortgage on his house, his personal credit card bill, groceries, golf tournament fees and car payments for his wife&quot;. While the spending was not illegal at the time, it reportedly undermined his campaign.
During the 1990 campaign, Pence ran a television advertisement in which an actor, dressed in a robe and headdress and speaking in a thick Middle Eastern accent, thanked his opponent, Sharp, for doing nothing to wean the United States off imported oil as chairman of a House subcommittee on energy and power. In response to criticism, Pence&#x27;s campaign responded that the advertisement was not about Arabs; rather, it concerned Sharp&#x27;s lack of leadership. In 1991, Pence wrote an essay published in the &quot;Indiana Policy Review&quot; in which he apologized for running negative ads against Sharp. Pence vowed to refrain from using insulting speech or running ads that belittle his adversaries. Also taking place in 1991, he became the president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a self-described free-market think tank and a member of the State Policy Network, a position he held until 1993.

Shortly after his first congressional campaign in 1988, radio station WRCR-FM in Rushville, Indiana, hired Pence to host a weekly half-hour radio show, &quot;Washington Update with Mike Pence&quot;. In 1992, Pence began hosting a daily talk show on WRCR, &quot;The Mike Pence Show&quot;, in addition to a Saturday show on WNDE in Indianapolis. Pence called himself &quot;Rush Limbaugh on decaf&quot; since he considered himself politically conservative while not as bombastic as Limbaugh. Beginning on April 11, 1994, Network Indiana syndicated &quot;The Mike Pence Show&quot; statewide. The program reached as many as 18 radio stations in Indiana, including WIBC in Indianapolis. From 1995, Pence also hosted a weekend public affairs TV show likewise titled &quot;The Mike Pence Show&quot; on Indianapolis TV station WNDY. Pence ended his radio and television shows in 1999 to focus on his 2000 campaign for Congress, which he eventually won.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2001–2013)==

Running for the U.S. House of Representatives again in 2000, he won the seat in after six-year incumbent David M. McIntosh opted to run for governor of Indiana. The 2nd district (renumbered the 6th in 2002) comprised all or portions of 19 counties in eastern Indiana. As a new congressman, Pence adopted the slogan he had used on the radio, describing himself as &quot;a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order&quot;. In 2016, House speaker Paul Ryan described Pence as a &quot;principled conservative&quot;. While in Congress, Pence belonged to the Tea Party Caucus.

In his first year in office, Pence opposed President George W. Bush&#x27;s No Child Left Behind Act in 2001, as well as President Bush&#x27;s Medicare prescription drug expansion in 2003. Pence was re-elected four more times by comfortable margins. In the 2006, 2008, and 2010 House elections, he defeated Democrat Barry Welsh.

Pence began to climb the party leadership structure and from 2005 to 2007 was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative House Republicans. In November 2006, Pence announced his candidacy for leader of the Republican Party (minority leader) in the United States House of Representatives. Pence&#x27;s release announcing his run for minority leader focused on a &quot;return to the values&quot; of the Newt Gingrich-headed 1994 Republican Revolution. However, he lost the bid to Representative John Boehner of Ohio by a vote of 168 for Boehner, 27 for Pence, and one for Representative Joe Barton of Texas. In January 2009, Pence was elected as the Republican Conference chairman, the third-highest-ranking Republican leadership position at the time behind Minority Leader John Boehner and Republican whip Eric Cantor. He ran unopposed and was elected unanimously. He was the first representative from Indiana to hold a House leadership position since 1981. During Pence&#x27;s twelve years in the House, he introduced 90 bills and resolutions; none became law. His committee assignments in the House were the following:
* 107th Congress (2001–2003): Agriculture, Judiciary, Small Business
* 108th Congress (2003–2005): Agriculture, International Relations, Judiciary
* 109th Congress (2005–2007): Agriculture, International Relations, Judiciary
* 110th Congress (2007–2009): Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, Select Committee to Investigate the Voting Irregularities of August 2, 2007 (Ranking Member)
* 111th Congress (2009–2011): Foreign Affairs
* 112th Congress (2011–2013): Foreign Affairs, Judiciary

In 2008, &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine listed Pence as one of the ten best members of Congress, writing that Pence&#x27;s &quot;unalloyed traditional conservatism has repeatedly pitted him against his party elders&quot;. Pence was mentioned as a possible Republican candidate for president in 2008 and 2012. In September 2010, he was the top choice for president in a straw poll conducted by the Values Voter Summit. That same year, he was encouraged to run against incumbent Democratic senator Evan Bayh, but opted not to enter the race, even after Bayh unexpectedly announced that he would retire.

===2012 Indiana gubernatorial election===

In May 2011, Pence announced that he would be seeking the Republican nomination for governor of Indiana in 2012. Incumbent Republican governor Mitch Daniels was term-limited. Pence ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of Daniels. The Democratic nominee was former Indiana speaker of the House John R. Gregg. Despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, Pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote, and less than 3% ahead of Gregg, with Libertarian nominee Rupert Boneham receiving most of the remaining votes. It was the closest race in 50 years.

==Governor of Indiana (2013–2017)==

Pence was sworn in as the 50th governor of Indiana on January 14, 2013.

===Fiscal and economic policy===

Pence &quot;inherited a $2billion budget reserve from his predecessor, Mitch Daniels, and the state... added to that reserve under his watch, though not before requiring state agencies, including public universities, to reduce funding in years in which revenue fell below projections&quot;. The state finished fiscal year 2014 with a reserve of $2billion; budget cuts ordered by Pence for the $14billion annual state budget include $24million cut from colleges and universities; $27million cut from the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA); and $12million cut from the Department of Correction. During Pence&#x27;s term as governor, the unemployment rate reflected the national average. Indiana&#x27;s job growth lagged slightly behind the national trend. In 2014, Indiana&#x27;s economy was among the slowest-growing in the United States, with 0.4 percent GDP growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector. Carrier Corp. and United Technologies Electronic Controls (UTEC) announced in 2016 that they would be closing two facilities in Indiana, sending 2,100 jobs to Mexico; the Trump campaign criticized the moves and Pence expressed &quot;deep disappointment&quot;. Pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received. The Indiana Economic Development Corporation led by Pence had approved $24million in incentives to ten companies who sent jobs abroad. $8.7million had been paid out by August 2016.

In 2013, Pence signed a law blocking local governments in Indiana from requiring businesses to offer higher wages or benefits beyond those required by federal law. In 2015, Pence also signed the repeal of an Indiana law that required construction companies working on publicly funded projects to pay a prevailing wage. Indiana had enacted right-to-work legislation under Pence&#x27;s predecessor, Republican governor Mitch Daniels. Under Pence, the state successfully defended this legislation against a labor challenge. In 2013, Pence also announced the formation of the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, a life sciences research facility supported with $25million in startup funds from the state.

Pence made tax reform, namely a ten percent income-tax rate cut, a priority for 2013. While he did not get the ten percent cut he advocated, Pence did accomplish his goal of cutting state taxes. Legislators cut the income tax by five percent and also killed the inheritance tax. Speaker of the House Brian Bosma said the legislative package was the &quot;largest tax cut in our state&#x27;s history, about $1.1billion dollars&quot;. By signing Senate Bill 1, the state corporate income tax would be dropped from 6.5 percent to 4.9 percent by 2021, which would be the second-lowest corporate income tax in the nation. The law also permitted Indiana counties to eliminate the business personal property tax on new equipment and let them exempt small businesses with less than $20,000 worth of equipment from paying personal property taxes.

On June 12, 2013, the Indiana Legislature overrode Pence&#x27;s veto of a bill to retroactively authorize a local tax. Lawmakers overrode his veto by a 68–23 vote in the House and a 34–12 one in the Senate. Republican legislators overwhelmingly voted against Pence, while most Democrats supported his veto. The Jackson–Pulaski tax fix, one of three bills vetoed by Pence during the session, addressed a 15-year-old county income tax that had been imposed to fund the construction of jail facilities with the stipulation that the tax be lowered by one percent after the first several years. The reduction had not been implemented and thus county residents had been paying an additional one percent tax that they were legally not required to pay. The bill, which was passed by a huge majority of legislators and subsequently vetoed by Pence, allowed money to be kept and not returned to the taxpayers as would have otherwise been necessary.

As governor, Pence pressed for a balanced budget amendment to the state&#x27;s constitution. He initially proposed the initiative in his State of the State address in January 2015. The legislation passed the state Senate. Indiana has had AAA credit ratings with the three major credit-rating agencies since 2010, before Pence took office; these ratings were maintained throughout Pence&#x27;s tenure.

In 2014, Pence supported the Indiana Gateway project, a $71.4million passenger and freight rail improvement initiative paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus package), which Pence had voted against while a congressman. In October 2015, Pence &quot;announced plans to pay off a $250million federal loan&quot; to cover unemployment insurance payments which had spiked during the recession. In March 2016, Pence signed legislation to fund a $230million two-year road-funding package.

===Education policy===

During his tenure as governor, Pence supported significant increases in education funding to pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, but frequently clashed with supporters of traditional public schools. In 2014, a little over one year after taking office, Pence helped establish a $10-million state preschool pilot program in Indiana and testified personally before the state Senate Education Committee in favor of the program to convince fellow Republicans (several of whom opposed the proposal) to approve the plan. Although the plan was initially defeated, Pence successfully managed to revive it, &quot;getting Indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool&quot;. Demand for enrollment in the program &quot;far outstripped&quot; capacity, and Pence at first refused to apply for up to $80million in federal Health and Human Services Preschool Development Grant program funding, arguing that &quot;Indiana must develop our own pre-K program without federal intrusion&quot;. After coming under sustained criticism for this position, Pence reversed course and sought to apply for the funds.

In 2015, Pence secured significant increases in charter-school funding from the legislation, although he did not get everything he had proposed. Legislation signed into law by Pence in 2013 greatly increased the number of students in Indiana who qualify for school vouchers, making it one of the largest voucher programs in the United States. The annual cost of the program was estimated to be $53million for the 2015–2016 school year.

Pence opposed the Common Core State Standards Initiative, calling for the repeal of the standards in his 2014 State of the State address. The Indiana General Assembly then passed a bill to repeal the standards, becoming the first state to do so. In a televised interview appearance with Chris Matthews, Pence advocated for putting creationism on a par with science in public schools, accepting creationist beliefs as factual, and thus teaching the controversy over evolution and natural selection, and regarding the age of the Earth, and letting children decide for themselves what to believe.

Despite successful advocacy for more funding for pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, Pence has frequently clashed with teachers unions and supporters of public schooling. In one of his first acts as governor, Pence removed control of the Educational Employment Relations Board, which was in charge of handling conflicts between unions and school boards, from Glenda Ritz, a Democrat who was the Indiana superintendent of public instruction (a separately elected position in the state). Pence created a new &quot;Center for Education and Career Innovation&quot; (CECI) to coordinate efforts between schools and the private sector; Ritz opposed the center, viewing it as a &quot;power grab&quot; and encroachment on her own duties. Pence eventually disestablished the center in order to help defuse the conflict. In May 2015, Pence signed a bill stripping Ritz of much of her authority over standardized testing and other education issues, and reconstituting the State Board of Education dominated by Pence appointees. The bill also allowed the board to appoint a chairman other than the Superintendent of Public Instruction starting in 2017, and added the State Board of Education (controlled by Pence) as a &quot;state educational authority&quot; along with the Department of Education (controlled by Ritz) for purposes of accessing sensitive student data. Pence and Ritz also clashed over non-binding federal guidelines that advised Indiana public schools must treat transgender students in a way that corresponds to their gender identity, even if their education files indicate a different gender.

===Energy and environment===

During Pence&#x27;s term in office, the Republican-controlled Indiana General Assembly &quot;repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended Indiana&#x27;s energy efficiency efforts&quot;. Pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 State of the State address that &quot;Indiana is a pro-coal state,&quot; expressing support for an &quot;all-of-the-above energy strategy&quot;, and stating: &quot;we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the EPA until we bring their war on coal to an end.&quot; In 2015, Pence sent a letter to President Obama denouncing the EPA&#x27;s Clean Power Plan (which would regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants) and stating that Indiana would refuse to comply with the plan. Indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan. In 2016, Pence said that even if legal challenges failed, Indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions.

===Gun policy===

In 2014, over the opposition of Indiana school organizations, Pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property. In 2015, following a shooting in Chattanooga, Pence recruited the National Rifle Association to train the Indiana National Guard on concealed carry. Some National Guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue. In May 2015, Pence signed into law Senate Bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the City of Gary&#x27;s still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns. The bill was supported by Republicans such as state senator Jim Tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses, but opposed by Gary mayor and former Indiana attorney general Karen Freeman-Wilson, who viewed the measure as &quot;an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government&quot;. In 2016, Pence signed Senate Bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer.

===Public health===

In 2009, parts of East Chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a Superfund site. Governor Pence declined to declare the Superfund site a state emergency; his successor Governor Eric Holcomb issued Executive Order 17–13, declaring a disaster emergency in East Chicago. The site of several former lead smelting plants was first identified as a health concern by the EPA in 1997.

Beginning in December 2014, there was an HIV outbreak in Southern Indiana. In 2011, Planned Parenthood (PP) operated five rural clinics in Indiana. They tested for HIV and offered prevention, intervention and counseling to improve public health outcomes. The PP clinic in Scott County performed no abortions. The Republican-controlled legislature and Pence defunded Planned Parenthood. Scott County has been without an HIV testing center since 2013. Pence had long been a vocal opponent of needle exchange programs, which allow drug users to trade in used syringes for sterile ones in order to stop the spread of diseases, despite solid scientific evidence that such programs prevent the spread of AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV), and Hepatitis C (HCV), and do not increase drug abuse. In March 2015, well after the outbreak began, Pence finally allowed at least five counties to open needle exchanges, but did not move to lift the state ban on funding for needle exchanges. Critics say Pence&#x27;s compromise had been ineffective because counties had no way to pay for needle exchanges themselves. Anesthesiologist Jerome Adams, then the Pence-appointed Indiana state health commissioner and later surgeon general of the United States during the Trump administration, defended Pence, arguing that publicly funded needle exchange programs are controversial in many conservative communities. During his time as Indiana State Health Commissioner, Adams—along with Governor Pence—delayed Indiana&#x27;s efforts to deal with the largest HIV outbreak related to injection drug use in the history of the United States by stalling adoption of a needle exchange program. Adams said, &quot;There are people who have real moral and ethical concerns about passing out needles to people with substance abuse problems. To be honest, I shared that sentiment.&quot; When President Trump appointed Pence in 2020 to head the country&#x27;s response to coronavirus, he touted his ostensible experience with quelling an epidemic of HIV in Indiana, in which Pence deliberately delayed his state government&#x27;s response to the disease despite the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control that needle exchange was an efficacious approach to reining in the spread of diseases. Pence had told lawmakers he would veto any bill they might pass that provided for such exchanges.

In 2015, Pence and the Obama administration agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana, in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. As part of the expansion, called the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, Pence negotiated modifications to the program for Indiana that included co-payments by participants. The co-payments are linked to healthy behaviors on the part of the participants so that, for example, a participant who quit smoking would receive a lower co-payment. Participants can lose benefits for failing to make the payments. The required contribution would be about 2% of income. Critics say those who already struggle to buy food and housing will have even more difficulty paying their 2%. One critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. A service provider said the program &quot;wins the award for bureaucratic complexity and red tape&quot;. In early 2017, Indiana submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to renew Healthy Indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. National Public Radio/Side Effects Public Media said the application used &quot;misleading and inaccurate information&quot;.

===Religion and LGBT rights===


On March 26, 2015, Pence signed Indiana Senate Bill 101, also known as the Indiana &quot;religious objections&quot; bill or Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), into law. The move was praised by religious conservatives, but criticized by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against LGBT persons. Such organizations as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the gamer convention Gen Con, and the Disciples of Christ spoke out against the law. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff condemned the law, with the latter&#x27;s company saying it would halt its plans to expand in the state. Angie&#x27;s List announced that they would cancel a $40million expansion of their Indianapolis-based headquarters over concerns with the law. The expansion would have moved 1,000 jobs into the state. Thousands protested against the policy. Five Republican state representatives voted against the bill, and Greg Ballard, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis, criticized it as sending the &quot;wrong signal&quot; about the state.

Pence defended the law, saying it was not about discrimination. In an appearance on the ABC News program &quot;This Week with George Stephanopoulos&quot;, he said, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to change the law,&quot; while refusing to answer whether examples of discrimination against LGBT people would be legal under the law. Pence denied the law permitted discrimination and wrote in a March 31, 2015 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed, &quot;If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn&#x27;t eat there anymore. As governor of Indiana, if I were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, I would veto it.&quot; In the wake of the backlash against the RFRA, on April 2, 2015, Pence signed legislation revising the law to protect against potential discrimination. Pence received heavy criticism from liberals at the time of signing the religious freedom law, who labeled him as anti-gay. In 2018, emails released to the Associated Press showed that conservatives had similarly opposed his support of the subsequent changes to the law.

===Abortion===

In March 2016, as Indiana governor, Pence signed into law H.B. 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. The bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus&#x27; race or gender or a fetal abnormality. In addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the Guttmacher Institute was not required in any other state. The law was described as &quot;exceptional for its breadth&quot;; if implemented, it would have made Indiana &quot;the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of Down syndrome&quot;. Days after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot;, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with U.S. district judge Tanya Walton Pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the State of Indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial. The abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in April 2018 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.

===Media and the press===

In June 2013, Pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government Facebook page; he apologized.

On January 26, 2015, it was widely reported that Pence had planned to launch a state-run, taxpayer-funded news service for Indiana. The service, called &quot;JustIN&quot;, was to be overseen by a former reporter for &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot;, and would feature breaking news, stories written by press secretaries, and light features. At the time, it was reported that the two employees who would run the news service would be paid a combined $100,000 yearly salary. The target audience was small newspapers which had limited staff, but the site would also serve to communicate directly with the public. The publisher of the &quot;Commercial Review&quot; of Portland, Indiana, said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a ludicrous idea... the notion of elected officials presenting material that will inevitably have a pro-administration point of view is antithetical to the idea of an independent press.&quot; There was speculation that the news service would publish pro-administration stories that would make Pence look good in the event of a presidential run.

According to the Associated Press, the idea &quot;of stories prewritten for the media set off a wave of criticism from journalists around the country, who likened the Indiana endeavor to state-run media in Russia and China. Headlines like &#x27;Pravda in the Plains&#x27; accompanied calls for Pence to scrap the idea.&quot; David A. Graham of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; regarded the announcement of JustIN as evidence of a disturbing changing trend in how the public gets news. After a week or so of controversy about the idea, Pence scrapped the idea saying, &quot;However well-intentioned, after thorough review of the preliminary planning and careful consideration of the concerns expressed, I am writing you to inform you that I have made a decision to terminate development of the JustIN website immediately.&quot;

===Syrian refugee crisis===

As governor, Pence attempted unsuccessfully to prevent Syrian refugees from being resettled in Indiana. In February 2016, a federal judge ruled that Pence&#x27;s order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; Pence unsuccessfully appealed. In December 2015, Pence said that &quot;calls to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. are offensive and unconstitutional&quot;.

===Public-records requests and use of private email===

Pence &quot;repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright&quot;. As governor, Pence routinely used a personal AOL email account to conduct official business, according to public records. In 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from Pence&#x27;s contacts. While Pence&#x27;s use of a private email account for state business is not prohibited by Indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues. In March 2017, after Pence had become vice president, the State of Indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure. Cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by Pence&#x27;s use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given Pence&#x27;s past attacks on Hillary Clinton&#x27;s use of a private email server while U.S. secretary of state. In 2017, Indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for Pence&#x27;s personal AOL account email correspondence.

===Re-election campaign and withdrawal===

Pence ran for a second term as governor and was unopposed in the Republican primary on May 3, 2016. He was to face Democrat John R. Gregg in a rematch of the 2012 race. However, Pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on July 15, 2016, as Trump announced his selection of Pence as his vice presidential running mate. Lieutenant Governor Eric Holcomb was nominated in Pence&#x27;s place, and selected Suzanne Crouch as his running mate. Holcomb went on to defeat Gregg in the general election.

==2016 vice presidential campaign==


Shortly before the 2016 Indiana Republican presidential primary, Pence endorsed Texas U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, who would lose the primary to Trump. Pence then endorsed Trump after the latter became the party&#x27;s presumptive nominee for president of the United States.

Donald Trump considered naming Pence as his vice presidential running mate along with other finalists including New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former House speaker Newt Gingrich. Pence had stronger connections at the time to the politically influential big donors, the Kochs, than Trump did. It was widely reported on July 14 that Pence planned to end his (Indiana gubernatorial) re-election campaign and accept the Republican vice presidential nomination instead. The following day, Trump officially announced on Twitter that Pence would be his running mate.

Immediately after the announcement, Pence said he was &quot;very supportive of Donald Trump&#x27;s call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the United States&quot;. Pence said he was &quot;absolutely&quot; in sync with Trump&#x27;s Mexican wall proposal, saying Mexico was &quot;absolutely&quot; going to pay for it.

According to a FiveThirtyEight rating of candidates&#x27; ideology, Pence was the most conservative vice-presidential candidate in the last 40 years.

Pence called Dick Cheney his role model for vice president.

During Pence&#x27;s preparations for the vice presidential debate in October 2016, Wisconsin governor Scott Walker played the role of Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. In Kaine&#x27;s own debate prep, lawyer Robert Barnett was selected to play Pence. Following the debate, experts concluded Pence won against Kaine, with a CNN poll showing 48 percent of viewers thought Pence won and 42 percent believing Kaine won. Pence&#x27;s &quot;cooler&quot; temperament was seen as an advantage compared to Kaine, who was perceived as more hotheaded.

On October 7, 2016, lewd comments made by Donald Trump in 2005 surfaced and gained heavy media attention. That day, Pence said to reporters, &quot;I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them,&quot; but made clear that he was standing by Trump. In response to the revelation, Paul Ryan &quot;uninvited&quot; Trump from what would have been a joint campaign event. The Trump campaign attempted to substitute Pence for Trump at the event, but according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Pence called Trump on October8 and told him that he (Pence) would not appear at the event, and that Trump would need to handle the next 48 hours on his own, as Pence did not think he would be an effective surrogate for Trump.

According to Bob Woodward&#x27;s 2018 book &quot;&quot;, in the midst of the scandal, then-Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus told Trump he should drop out of the race for the good of the party, and that Pence had agreed to replace Trump on the top of the ticket as the Republican presidential nominee, with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice agreeing to be Pence&#x27;s running mate.

On October 10, 2016, Pence appeared on CNN and said, in response to rumors that he was leaving the ticket, that it was &quot;absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket&quot; and that it is the &quot;greatest honor of my life&quot; to be nominated as Trump&#x27;s running mate.

On November 8, 2016, Pence was elected vice president of the United States as Trump&#x27;s running mate.

==Vice presidency (2017–2021)==


Soon after the election, he was appointed chairman of President-elect Trump&#x27;s transition team. During the transition phase of the Trump administration, Pence was reported as holding a large degree of influence in the administration due to his roles as a mediator between Trump and congressional Republicans, for reassuring conservatives about Trump&#x27;s conservative credentials, and his influence in determining Donald Trump&#x27;s cabinet.

On January 20, 2017, at noon, Pence became the 48th vice president of the United States, sworn into the office by justice Clarence Thomas.

===Tenure===

On the first day in office (January 20), Pence performed various ceremonial duties, including swearing in Jim Mattis as United States secretary of defense and John Kelly as secretary of homeland security. He also administered the oath of office to the White House senior staff on January 22, 2017.

Pence also sat in on calls made by President Trump to foreign heads of government and state such as Russian president Vladimir Putin and Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.

In January, Pence appointed Josh Pitcock as his chief of staff, whom he had known from his gubernatorial and congressional days. The following month, Jarrod Agen was tapped as deputy assistant to the president and director of communications to the vice president; his previous job being chief of staff for governor of Michigan Rick Snyder through the time of the Flint water crisis. In July, Pitcock stepped down as chief of staff, and was succeeded in the position by Nick Ayers, another longtime Pence advisor.

On February 5, 2017, Pence warned Iran &quot;not to test the resolve&quot; of the new Trump administration following their ballistic missile tests.

On February 7, 2017, Pence, in his dual constitutional role as president of the United States Senate made the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member. He cast the deciding vote to break a fifty-fifty tie to confirm Betsy DeVos as the secretary of education. Pence cast his second tie-breaking vote on March 30, voting to advance a bill to defund Planned Parenthood. In 2018, Pence broke a tie to confirm Jonathan A. Kobes for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This was the first-ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a judicial nominee in U.S. history. In total, Pence cast 13 tie-breaking votes, the seventh-most in history and more than the previous four predecessors combined. (By comparison, his successor, Kamala Harris, cast a total of 33 tie-breaking votes, the most by any senate president, and more than the previous six predecessors combined.)

In April, Pence made a tour of the Asia-Pacific region. In South Korea, he met acting president Hwang Kyo-ahn and condemned North Korea&#x27;s latest missile launch. In Japan, Pence met Prime Minister Shinzō Abe and pledged to work with Japan, South Korea, and China &quot;to achieve a peaceable resolution and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,&quot; adding &quot;The era of strategic patience is over and while all options are on the table.&quot; Pence subsequently traveled to Jakarta, Indonesia, where he met with president Joko Widodo, toured the largest mosque in the region (the Istiqlal Mosque), and praised moderate Islam. Pence ended his trip with stops in Sydney, Australia (where, after meeting with Malcolm Turnbull, he said the U.S. &quot;intends to honor&quot; a U.S.–Australia refugee resettlement agreement), Oahu, Hawaii, and American Samoa.

On May 21, 2017, Pence delivered the commencement address at the University of Notre Dame. Traditionally, the president delivers the address at Notre Dame in his inaugural year, but in 2017 Pence was invited instead when Trump decided to speak at Liberty University.
On June 30, 2017, Pence was appointed chair of the National Space Council after Trump signed an executive order reestablishing the council. As chair, Pence held eight meetings from 2017 to 2020.

On October 8, 2017, Pence walked out of a game between the NFL&#x27;s Indianapolis Colts and San Francisco 49ers after members of the 49ers knelt during the national anthem. Shortly afterwards, Pence commented via Twitter, &quot;President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our national anthem,&quot; adding, &quot;While everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask NFL players to respect the flag and our national anthem.&quot; Pence was widely criticized by various people for what was considered a publicity stunt. Democratic representative Adam Schiff (CA-28) questioned how much taxpayer&#x27;s money was used to fund Pence&#x27;s actions, and CNN later estimated that the total cost of his eight hours of travel on Air Force Two to attend the game was about $242,500, not including ground transportation and security. 49ers safety Eric Reid (the second NFL player after Colin Kaepernick to participate in the protests) told reporters it was predictable that Pence would walk out, knowing that most of the team were protesting. Reid also expressed doubt over the regularity Pence is in terms of attending Colts matches, and referenced a photograph of the vice president and his wife in Colts uniform that had been tweeted before the match, although the official photograph (right) proved otherwise. The photograph in question was first published in 2014. Sportswriter Peter King wrote that the furor surrounding Pence had overshadowed Peyton Manning, who was being honored by the Colts, saying, &quot;Pence trumped a day that belonged to the greatest football hero the state of Indiana has ever seen, and he did it for political purposes... he stole Manning&#x27;s last great day as a Colt. [He] will have to live with himself for that.&quot; The following year, Pence reacted positively on Twitter, after NFL owners unanimously decided to approve a new policy requiring all players to stand (or, given the option to stay in the locker room) during the national anthem, despite not consulting the NFL Players Association.
On February 1, 2018, it was announced that Pence would lead the presidential delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics, alongside his wife. Much of Pence&#x27;s time at Pyeongchang was affected by the ongoing North Korean crisis. Prior to the opening ceremony, on February 9, Pence skipped on a dinner held by South Korean president Moon Jae-in, as he would have shared a table with North Korea&#x27;s ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam. Instead, he met with four North Korean defectors in Pyeongtaek, alongside his special guest, Fred Warmbier (the father of Otto Warmbier, who was arrested in North Korea for attempted theft, and sentenced to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment, before returning to the U.S. in a comatose state). At the ceremony, the Pences were seated in front of the North Korean delegates, and when North and South Korean athletes entered during the Parade of Athletes, they chose to stay seated, which prompted critics to accuse Pence of hypocrisy in regard to the NFL protests. Pence was supposed to meet with the North Koreans on February 10, but they pulled out at the last day.
Over the next few months, the North Koreans started communicating more with their neighbors, as Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un secretly met with Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping in March and then Moon Jae-in in an historic inter-Korean summit in April, and around the same time, a meeting between Trump and Kim was also proposed. On May 10, Pence accompanied Trump to Andrews Air Force Base as three American citizens were released by North Korea, and in an early morning interview with ABC&#x27;s Jonathan Karl, he said seeing the men back on American soil &quot;was really one of the greatest joys of my life&quot;. Talks broke down later that month following comments made by Pence and Trump, comparing the situation to events in Libya seven years previous, despite their voluntary disarmament of nuclear weapons in 2003. North Korean vice foreign minister Choe Son-hui called Pence&#x27;s remarks &quot;ignorant and stupid&quot;. On May 24, Trump abruptly called off the summit with Pence in attendance, only for him to change his mind a day later, later announcing that it would still be scheduled to take place on June 12 in Singapore.

In October 2018, Pence gave a speech regarding China at the Hudson Institute, accusing China of predatory economic practices, military aggression and trying to undermine President Trump. He said China &quot;wants a different American president&quot;, and accused the country of meddling in U.S. elections. He said China was building &quot;an unparalleled surveillance state&quot; to suppress minorities, and accused it of engaging in &quot;debt-trap diplomacy&quot;. In regards to Taiwan, he said &quot;while our administration will continue to respect our One China Policy … Taiwan’s embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the speech, with a tone much more hawkish than what U.S. officials previously used regarding China, was similar to a declaration of a new Cold War.

In September 2019, Pence attended official meetings with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin, Ireland but stayed at President Trump&#x27;s resort in Doonbeg, away. Pence&#x27;s schedule included four hours spent in transit in one day, and two flights on Air Force Two before the end of the next day. Costs for the limousine service alone totaled $599,000 according to State Department receipts, compared to President Obama&#x27;s three-day trip to Dublin with the same limousine company totaling $114,000.

In February 2020, Pence defended debt- and deficit-spending as a measure to stimulate economic growth.

====Political action committee====

In May 2017, Pence filed Federal Election Commission paperwork to form &quot;Great America Committee&quot;, a political action committee (PAC) that would be headed by his former campaign staffers Nick Ayers and Marty Obst. Pence is the only vice president to have started his own PAC while still in office. Pence denied a &quot;New York Times&quot; article&#x27;s allegations that he would run for president in 2020, calling them &quot;laughable and absurd&quot;, and said the article was &quot;disgraceful and offensive&quot;.

====Pence and the Trump impeachment inquiry====

Pence was a key player in the Trump–Ukraine scandal and the Trump impeachment inquiry. Pence had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine. Pence met with Zelensky in Poland on September 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in U.S. military aid to Ukraine. Pence later told the press that he did not mention 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden to Zelensky, but raised issues regarding Ukrainian corruption.

After the inquiry was opened, Pence publicly stated his support of Trump&#x27;s call for foreign investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter, saying, &quot;I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position.&quot; On October 3, Pence stated, &quot;My predecessor had a son who was paid $50,000 a month to be on a Ukrainian board at the time that Vice President Biden was leading the Obama administration&#x27;s efforts in Ukraine, I think [that] is worth looking into.&quot;

====Death of Soleimani====

Pence defended Trump&#x27;s decision in January 2020 to assassinate the Iranian major general in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Qasem Soleimani, promoting conspiracy theories that supposedly linked the al-Qaeda attacks on the United States to Iran. In a series of tweets, the vice president termed Soleimani &quot;an evil man who was responsible for killing thousands of Americans&quot;. Pence insisted Soleimani had &quot;assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks&quot;, which critics said was his confusing the number of 9/11 hijackers (actually 19) and insinuating (without evidence) that the general was involved. Many experts responded that Pence&#x27;s claims were unsubstantiated. Pence&#x27;s spokeswoman Katie Waldman said that the dozen terrorists Pence referred to were those who had traveled through Afghanistan, ten of whom &quot;were assisted by Soleimani&quot;.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
On February 26, 2020, President Trump named Pence as the leader of the White House Coronavirus Task Force to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Various public health officials and members of Congress had suggested the selection of a &quot;Coronavirus Czar&quot;, though Trump said that would not be the title&#x27;s name. As the leader of the task force, Pence coordinated efforts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, Department of Homeland Security, and White House Office.

In April 2020, Pence exempted himself from the Mayo Clinic&#x27;s policy of wearing a face mask in the hospital during a visit. Pence defended his action, saying he needed to look staff &quot;in the eye&quot;. The next day, the vice president&#x27;s opponents criticized him for promoting &quot;completely irresponsible public health messaging&quot;. Later, Pence acknowledged he should have worn a mask during the hospital visit, and did so two days later when visiting a ventilator production facility.

In late June 2020, as coronavirus cases were spiking, Pence gave an optimistic press briefing where he made several misleading and false claims about the state of the coronavirus pandemic. He misleadingly argued that surges in cases were the result of increased testing, telling reporters that increases in new cases were &quot;a reflection of a great success in expanding testing across the country&quot;. However, health experts noted that case growth outpaced the number of tests, and that the share of positive tests was increasing. Pence also falsely claimed that coronavirus fatalities were declining all across the country (Statistics here), that the curve had been flattened, and that all 50 states were opening up. In private meetings with Republican senators, Pence urged them to focus on &quot;encouraging signs&quot;. Pence told the senators that cases were increasing in only 3% of counties and 12 states; however, data at the time showed that cases were increasing in at least 5% of counties and in at least 20 states. On December 18, the Pences received the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, in front of a live audience at a televised event to show Americans that the vaccine is safe and effective.

===2020 vice presidential election===

Ahead of his presidential campaign on February 28, 2019, Joe Biden referred to Pence as a &quot;decent guy&quot; in a speech in Omaha, Nebraska, when making an anecdote about an audience falling silent after Pence mentioned Trump&#x27;s name. Biden later faced criticism for his complimentary remarks due to Pence&#x27;s alleged anti-LGBT positions, which Biden would later apologize for and clarify by saying, &quot;I was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a Vice President wouldn&#x27;t be given a silent reaction on the world stage.&quot; Biden had previously referred to Pence as a &quot;decent guy&quot; in 2018, and Pence and Biden exchanged conversations via phone before Pence&#x27;s 2017 transition into the vice presidency.

In June 2019, the Democratic former New York City Council president Andrew Stein opined that Trump could improve his re-election chances by replacing Pence as his running mate with former South Carolina governor and former United States ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley. Despite that, Trump said Pence will be his running mate. He declined to endorse Pence should his running mate seek in 2024 to succeed him, but said he would give it &quot;very strong consideration&quot;.

In remarks about law enforcement during the 2020 Republican convention, Pence said a federal security officer, Dave Underwood, &quot;was shot and killed during the riots in Oakland&quot;, implying he was killed by rioters, when instead a man linked to the far-right Boogaloo movement had exploited the unrest as a cover for murder.

On October 7, 2020, Pence participated in a debate with Kamala Harris that was held by &quot;USA Today&quot; in Salt Lake City, Utah, and moderated by Susan Page, the Washington bureau chief of the newspaper. The debate was held with adaptations designed to avoid contagion of the COVID-19 virus given that the vice president had been in close contact with people who had been infected at a recent event at the White House. Plexiglas partitions separated the candidates and masks were required for all attending except the candidates and moderator. By some estimates, Pence interrupted Harris twice as much as she interrupted him. Media outlets noted that near the end of the debate, a fly landed on Pence&#x27;s head for almost two minutes. A CNN poll found that 59% of registered voters felt that Harris had won the debate, while 38% felt that Pence had.

On November 7, 2020, after several days of vote counting, Biden and Harris were declared by most major news networks to be the winners of the election. On December 14 the Electoral College confirmed the win, giving the Biden-Harris campaign 306 votes compared to 232 for the Trump–Pence campaign; however, Trump refused to concede and insisted that he had actually won. Throughout November and December Trump and his campaign filed more than 50 lawsuits alleging election fraud and other irregularities; all of them were eventually rejected by judges. 
Trump also pressured Republican officials, lawmakers and even the Justice Department to take actions to overturn the election.

In late December 2020, a federal lawsuit was filed against Pence by Republican congressman Louie Gohmert and 11 Arizona Republicans who would have become presidential electors had Trump actually won Arizona. The plaintiffs sought to give the vice president the power to reject state certified presidential electors in favour of &quot;competing slates of electors&quot; so that Biden&#x27;s victory over Trump could be overturned. The United States Department of Justice represented Pence in this case, and argued for its dismissal, stating that the lawsuit was a &quot;walking legal contradiction&quot; because it sought to grant power to the vice president, while suing the vice president. Within a week, the lawsuit was dismissed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, and the appeal was rejected by a United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit panel, both due to the plaintiffs&#x27; lack of standing. Gohmert then appealed to the Supreme Court, which on January7 tersely &quot;denied&quot; his petition.

====Vote counting and storming of the Capitol====

In January 2021, Trump began to pressure Pence to take action to overturn the election. As vice president, Pence presided over the January 6, 2021, congressional joint session to count the electoral votes—normally a non-controversial, ceremonial event. In the days leading up to the session, Trump declared both in public and in private that Pence should use that position to overturn the election results in swing states and declare Trump–Pence the winners of the election. Pence demurred that the United States Constitution did not give him that power, but Trump falsely insisted that &quot;The Vice President and I are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.&quot; 
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, multiple sources claim that Trump called Pence before he departed to certify the results urging him again one last time ultimately telling him, &quot;You can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy.&quot; 
Before the start of the Joint Session, Pence stated in a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letter that the Constitution prevented him from deciding which electoral votes counted and which did not. According to &quot;Politico&quot;, Pence was inspired by Al Gore presiding over his own defeat twenty years earlier during the 2000 presidential election, when Pence was a newly-elected member of Congress.

On January 6, 2021, the day on which a joint session of Congress met to count and certify the results of the Electoral College for the 2020 presidential election, Trump held a rally at which he urged listeners to go to the Capitol and repeatedly expressed the hope that Pence would &quot;do the right thing&quot;. Many listeners then marched to the Capitol and stormed it. 

On January 15, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Pence came &quot;dangerously close&quot; to the rioters during their occupation of the Capitol. Pence was not evacuated from the Senate chambers until 14 minutes after the initial breach of the Capitol was reported. He and his family were eventually ushered from the Senate chambers into a second-floor hideaway. One minute later, the mob rushed onto a stair landing only 100 feet away, from which they could have seen him enter the room if they had arrived a minute earlier. After his evacuation from the Senate chambers, his Secret Service detail wanted to move him away from the Capitol building but he refused to get in the car.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blake_4/26/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pence later approved the deployment of the National Guard, which raised questions as the vice president is not the commander-in-chief. After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session, and officially certified the election results with Pence declaring Biden and Harris the winners. 
During the siege, Trump criticized Pence as lacking &quot;courage&quot;. Earlier L. Lin Wood, a lawyer associated with Trump, had called for Pence to be &quot;executed&quot; by &quot;firing squad&quot;. In spite of the threats against Pence, Trump never reached out to Pence or inquired about his safety during the attack on the Capitol, according to sources close to the vice president. Aides believed that Pence was being set up as a scapegoat for Trump&#x27;s failure to overturn the results of the election. Pence was described as very angry with Trump. The two did not speak for several days, until January 11 when they met at the White House to discuss the prior week&#x27;s Capitol siege and the final days of their administration.

On January 20, Pence attended the inauguration of Joe Biden as president of the United States, unlike Trump. Afterwards, he left the Capitol with his successor, Kamala Harris.

==Post-vice presidency (2021–present)==
Pence did not have a permanent place of residence in Indiana when he left the vice presidency. Official records indicated that Pence had not owned a residence in Indiana since 2013, having lived in the governor&#x27;s mansion and then the vice president&#x27;s residence in Washington. As a result, for several months after leaving office, he and his wife stayed at residences owned by various Indiana Republican politicians. It is believed that he was at one time staying in a cabin owned by his former lieutenant governor, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb. In May 2021, the Pences bought a home in Carmel, Indiana.

In February 2021, it was announced that Pence would join The Heritage Foundation as a distinguished visiting fellow. He also joined the Young America&#x27;s Foundation conservative youth organization, with plans to launch a new podcast with the group in the coming months. At speaking engagements in the months after the end of the Trump administration, Pence spoke with &quot;an almost reverence&quot; of the former president, according to one journalist.
Pence narrated a four-part television series on the career of right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh titled &quot;Age of Rush&quot;, which debuted on Fox Nation in March 2021. Pence had previously cited Limbaugh as an inspiration for his career in talk radio and then in politics. In April 2021, it was reported that Pence signed a deal with publisher Simon &amp; Schuster for two books, including an autobiography.

The day the Supreme Court overturned &quot;Roe&quot; in June 2022, Pence told Breitbart News: &quot;&quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; has been consigned to the ash heap of history...Having been given this second chance for life, we must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land.&quot;

Pence appeared in the July 2022 documentary &quot;Unprecedented&quot;.

In October 2022, Pence condemned &quot;unprincipled populism&quot; and &quot;Putin apologists&quot; in the Republican Party.

Since leaving the vice presidency, Pence has distanced himself from Trump&#x27;s attempts to cast doubt on the 2020 presidential election and made high-profile speeches in early nominating states. Pence has also separated himself from Trump by endorsing candidates in several Republican primary elections in opposition to the candidate endorsed by Trump. In the primary for governor of Georgia, Pence endorsed incumbent governor Brian Kemp over the Trump-backed candidate, former senator David Perdue. This was described as a &quot;proxy battle&quot; between Pence and Trump, with Pence&#x27;s candidate Kemp winning the nomination easily. In the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial election, Pence endorsed Karrin Taylor Robson while Trump endorsed Kari Lake. In the 2022 Wisconsin gubernatorial election Pence endorsed former Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch; Trump supported businessman Tim Michels.

On February 9, 2023, it was reported that Pence had been subpoenaed by special counsel Jack Smith regarding the attack on the Capitol, following months of negotiation between Pence&#x27;s attorneys and the special counsel. After several unsuccessful challenges to the subpoena by Pence&#x27;s lawyers and by Trump himself, Pence testified before the grand jury on April 27, 2023, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll obey the law, we&#x27;ll tell the truth.&quot;

The same day as the subpoena was reported, Pence released a statement expressing support for &quot;parental rights&quot;, especially regarding how teachers treat children who express different gender identities, which he described as left-wing efforts &quot;to indoctrinate our children behind parents&#x27; backs&quot;. The statement was released through Advancing American Freedom, a communications group he founded in 2021 with political donations.

Ahead of the RNC in 2024, Pence released a statement condemning the new GOP stance on abortion, which echoed Trump&#x27;s position that the issue should be determined by individual states. Pence described this shift as a &quot;profound disappointment&quot;, arguing that it strips away &quot;historic pro-life principles that have long been the cornerstone of the platform&quot;.

In October 2024, Pence said he supported the acquisition of U.S. Steel by the Japanese company Nippon Steel, arguing it would prevent the world from becoming more reliant on steel exports from China. President Biden blocked the purchase in January 2025.

===Classified documents investigation===

In January 2023, after classified documents were found at the home of President Joe Biden, Pence asked his lawyer to search his home &quot;out of an abundance of caution&quot;. The attorney found around a dozen documents marked as classified in Pence&#x27;s Indiana home and turned over the documents to the FBI. The discovery came after Pence had repeatedly said that he did not have classified documents. Pence has taken responsibility for the documents and said that he was unaware of his possession of them. The FBI and the Justice Department&#x27;s National Security Division reviewed the incident. Pence indicated he would &quot;fully cooperate&quot;. On February 10, the FBI searched his home. In June, the Department of Justice notified Pence that its investigation had ended and that no charges would be brought forward.

===2024 presidential campaign===
Polls of Republicans in 2021 regarding their preferred presidential candidate in 2024 implied that Pence could begin a campaign as a top-tier candidate if former President Trump were to forgo a run. At the same time, said polling also foretold a precipitous decline in Pence&#x27;s polling numbers if Trump were to seek the presidency again. In light of this, there was a widespread view among both Republican leaders and grassroots Republicans that &quot;Pence is dead in the early waters of 2024.&quot;

In May 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Pence was considering a presidential run regardless of whether Trump decided to run for a second term.

In 2023, Pence criticized former President Donald Trump, especially regarding the events that took place on January 6, 2021. While speaking at a Gridiron Club Dinner, an event attended by politicians and journalists, Pence said that Trump was wrong to suggest that Pence had a right to overturn the election results. Pence went further, saying that Trump&#x27;s words not only endangered him, but his family and everyone at the Capitol.

On June 5, 2023, Pence filed paperwork and officially launched his bid for the presidency. In July, Pence became the first 2024 Republican presidential candidate to visit Ukraine, where he met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

On October 28, 2023, Pence, who had weak fundraising and poll numbers, withdrew from the race. Much of his campaigning had taken place in Iowa.

On March 15, 2024, Pence announced that he would not endorse Trump, nor would he support Biden in the 2024 presidential election. Pence did not attend the 2024 Republican National Convention. On August 9, 2024, Pence reiterated that he would not endorse Trump, nor would he support Kamala Harris after Biden withdrew from the race.

===Post-campaign activity===
In September 2024, Pence began teaching seminar and lecture courses in political science at Grove City College after being named its first Distinguished Fellow for Faith and Public Life. Teaching alongside the college president, Pence may join future classes at the western Pennsylvania college via videoconference, depending on his schedule.

On January 16, 2025, speaking in Taipei, Pence urged President-elect Trump to avert a nuclear arms race by continuing to support an independent Taiwan as a key Asian ally. On January 20, 2025, Pence attended Trump&#x27;s second inauguration as a former vice president.

==Personal life==
Pence and his wife, Karen ( Batten), met while he was in law school at Indiana University. They were married in 1985. Pence&#x27;s father died in 1988, leaving his mother a widow with four grown children and two teenagers. Mike and Karen Pence have three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey. Michael Pence is a pilot in the United States Marine Corps. During Pence&#x27;s service in the House, his family lived in Arlington, Virginia when Congress was in session and in Columbus, Indiana, during recesses. During an interview in 2002, Pence told a reporter that he would not have dinner alone with a woman other than his wife. On May 1, 2004, Pence&#x27;s mother remarried – this time to Basil Coolidge Fritsch. In 2018, Pence&#x27;s oldest brother, Greg, entered and won the political race to represent Indiana&#x27;s 6th congressional district in Congress (the seat previously held by Mike). Greg and Mike are similar enough in appearance that Greg once successfully acted as a decoy to lure the press away from his brother when Mike Pence was being touted as a potential running mate to Donald Trump.

In 2016 he was diagnosed with asymptomatic left bundle branch block. In April 2021, Pence underwent surgery for a pacemaker implant due to a slow heartbeat.

The family&#x27;s pet rabbit, Marlon Bundo, was the subject of a children&#x27;s book authored by Pence&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte.

===Religion===

Pence was raised in a Catholic family, was an altar server, and attended parochial school. He became a born-again Christian in college, while a member of a nondenominational Christian student group, and identified his first year—and specifically &quot;a Christian music festival in Asbury, Kentucky, in the spring of 1978&quot; referring to the Ichthus Music Festival at then Asbury College in Wilmore, Kentucky—as the moment he made a &quot;commitment to Christ&quot;. After that point, Pence continued to attend Mass (where he met his wife) and was a Catholic youth minister. Pence called himself Catholic in a 1994 news piece, although by 1995, he and his family had joined an evangelical megachurch, the Grace Evangelical Church. In 2013, Pence said his family was &quot;kind of looking for a church&quot;. In 2016, Pence and his wife regularly worshiped at College Park Church, a nondenominational church in Indianapolis. He has described himself as &quot;a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order&quot;, and as &quot;a born-again, Evangelical Catholic&quot;. As one commentator put it, &quot;Pence doesn&#x27;t simply wear his faith on his sleeve—he wears the entire Jesus jersey.&quot;

In a 2002 statement on the floor of the House of Representatives (reported in the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;), Pence told his colleagues &quot;...I also believe that someday scientists will come to see that only the theory of intelligent design provides even a remotely rational explanation for the known universe.&quot; When asked by Chris Matthews in 2009 if he believed in evolution, Pence said &quot;I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them. How he did that, I&#x27;ll ask him about some day.&quot;

<text>Saturn-Apollo 4 (SA-4) was the fourth launch of a Saturn I launch vehicle and the last of the initial test phase of the first stage. It was part of the Apollo Program.

==Objectives==
SA-4 was the last flight to test only the S-I first stage of the Saturn I rocket. As with the first three launches this would be a suborbital flight and would test the structural integrity of the rocket.

The major addition to this flight was that, in order to test the rocket&#x27;s ability to deal with an engine failure during the flight, one of the engines would be programmed to shut down about 100 seconds after launch. If all went well the rocket would reroute the fuel for this engine to the other engines and have the rocket burn longer to compensate for the loss of acceleration. This was used successfully on the later Apollo 6 and Apollo 13 flights (both Saturn V rockets).

Also on this flight, the dummy second stage was outfitted with the aerodynamic design of the real second stage. This included vent ducts, fairings and dummy camera pods. The rocket also flew with antennae designed for the Block II version of the rocket.

==Flight==
After the shortest checkout time of any rocket at 54 days, SA-4 went on to experience the longest series of holds of any mission at 120 minutes. The SA-4 launch would be the final single-stage flight.

The rocket operated perfectly through the first 100 seconds of the flight, when the No. 5 engine shut off as planned. The rocket then continued to operate properly, the propellant system rerouting the fuel to the other engines. The No. 5 engine did not disintegrate because of heat caused by the lack of cooling propellant as some had predicted. This was an important test proving an important feature of the clustered engine design.

The rocket reached a maximum height of 129 km and a peak velocity of 5906 km per hour. At this stage it also fired retrorockets that would be used on later missions to separate the rocket stages. On SA-4 the stages were not designed to separate but tested the retrorockets to make sure they would fire.

<text>A mint is an industrial facility which manufactures coins that can be used as currency.

The history of mints correlates closely with the history of coins. In the beginning, hammered coinage or cast coinage were the chief means of coin minting, with resulting production runs numbering as little as the hundreds or thousands. In modern mints, coin dies are manufactured in large numbers and planchets are made into milled coins by the billions.

With the mass production of currency, the production cost is weighed when minting coins. For example, it costs the United States Mint much less than 25 cents to make a quarter (a 25 cent coin), and the difference in production cost and face value (called seigniorage) helps fund the minting body. Conversely, a U.S. penny ($0.01) cost $0.015 to make in 2016.

==History==

===The first minted coins===
The first mint was likely established in Lydia in the 7th century BC, for coining gold, silver and electrum. The first coins known to be minted on European soil come from the island of Aegina. A electron stater bearing the image of a turtle dates back to 7th century BC. A mint existed at the ancient city of Cydonia on Crete at least as early as the fifth century BCE.
At about the same time, coins and mints appeared independently in China and spread to Korea and Japan. The manufacture of coins in the Roman Republic, dating from about the 4th century BCE, significantly influenced the later development of coin minting in Europe.

The origin of the word &quot;mint&quot; is ascribed to the manufacture of silver coin at the temple of Juno Moneta in 269 BCE Rome. This goddess became the personification of money, and her name was applied both to money and to its place of manufacture. Roman mints were spread widely across the Empire, and were sometimes used for propaganda purposes. The populace often learned of a new Roman Emperor when coins appeared with the new Emperor&#x27;s portrait. Some of the emperors who ruled only for a short time made sure that a coin bore their image; Quietus, for example, ruled only part of the Roman Empire from 260 to 261 AD, and yet he issued two coins bearing his image.

===Early minting technology===

Ancient coins were made by casting in moulds or by striking between engraved dies. The Romans cast their larger copper coins in clay moulds carrying distinctive markings, not because they knew nothing of striking, but because it was not suitable for such large masses of metal. Casting is now used only by counterfeiters. The most ancient coins were cast in bulletshaped or conical moulds and marked on one side by means of a die which was struck with a hammer. The &quot;blank&quot; or unmarked piece of metal was placed on a small anvil, and the die was held in position with tongs. The reverse or lower side of the coin received a &quot;rough incuse&quot; by the hammer. Later a rectangular mark, a &quot;square incuse&quot;, was made by the sharp edges of the little anvil, or punch. The rich iconography of the obverse of the early electrum coins contrasts with the dull appearance of their reverse which usually carries only punch marks. The shape and number of these punches varied according to their denomination and weight-standard. Subsequently, the anvil was marked in various ways, and decorated with letters and figures of beasts, and later still the anvil was replaced by a reverse die. The spherical blanks soon gave place to lenticular-shaped ones. The blank was made red-hot and struck between cold dies. One blow was usually insufficient, and the method was similar to that still used in striking medals in high relief, except that the blank is now allowed to cool before being struck. With the substitution of iron for bronze as the material for dies, about 300 AD, the practice of striking the blanks while they were hot was gradually discarded.

In the Middle Ages bars of metal were cast and hammered out on an anvil. Portions of the flattened sheets were then cut out with shears, struck between dies and again trimmed with shears. A similar method had been used in Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemaic Kingdom (c. 300 BC), but had been forgotten. Square pieces of metal were also cut from cast bars, converted into round disks by hammering and then struck between dies. In striking, the lower die was fixed into a block of wood, and the blank piece of metal laid upon it by hand. The upper die was then placed on the blank, and kept in position by means of a holder around which was placed a roll of lead to protect the hand of the operator while heavy blows were struck with a hammer. An early improvement was the introduction of a tool resembling a pair of tongs, the two dies being placed one at the extremity of each leg. This avoided the necessity of readjusting the dies between blows, and ensured greater accuracy in the impression.
===The screw press===

Minting by means of a falling weight (monkey press) intervened between the hand hammers and the screw press in many places. In Birmingham in particular this system became highly developed and was long in use. In 1553, the French engineer Aubin Olivier introduced screw presses for striking coins, together with rolls for reducing the cast bars and machines for punching-out round disks from flattened sheets of metal. 8 to 12 men took over from each other every quarter of an hour to maneuver the arms driving the screw which struck the medals. Later, the rolls were driven by horses, mules or water-power.

Henry II came up against hostility on the part of the coin makers, so the process was largely discarded in 1585 and only used for coins of small value, medals and tokens. The system was reintroduced into France by Jean Varin in 1640 and the practice of hammering was forbidden in 1645. In England the new machinery was tried in London in 1561, but abandoned soon afterwards; it was finally adopted in 1662, although the old pieces continued in circulation until 1696.

===Industrial minting===
Industrial techniques and steam-power were introduced to coin manufacture by industrialist Matthew Boulton in Birmingham in 1788. By 1786, two-thirds of the coins in circulation in Britain were counterfeit, and the Royal Mint responded to this crisis by shutting itself down, worsening the situation. Boulton, business partner of the engineer James Watt in the firm of Boulton &amp; Watt for the manufacture of steam engines, turned his attention to coinage in the mid-1780s as an extension to the small metal products he already manufactured in his factory in Soho. In 1788 he established a Mint as part of his industrial plant. He invented a steam driven screw press in the same year (his original machinery was being used at the Royal Mint until 1881, almost a century later), which worked by atmospheric pressure applied to a piston. The piston was in communication with a vacuum vessel from which the air had been pumped by steam power.
He installed eight of these state-of-the-art steam-driven presses in his factory, each with the capacity to strike between 70 and 84 coins per minute. The firm had little immediate success getting a license to strike British coins, but was soon engaged in striking coins for the British East India Company, Sierra Leone and Russia, while producing high-quality planchets, or blank coins, to be struck by national mints elsewhere. The firm sent over 20 million blanks to Philadelphia, to be struck into cents and half-cents by the United States Mint—Mint Director Elias Boudinot found them to be &quot;perfect and beautifully polished&quot;.

These were the first truly modern coins; the mass-production of coinage with steam driven machinery organised in factories enabled the achievement of standardized dimensions and uniform weight and roundness, something no counterfeiter of the day could hope to achieve. Boulton also pioneered special methods to further frustrate counterfeiters. Designed by Heinrich Küchler, the coins featured a raised rim with incuse or sunken letters and numbers. The high-technology of Soho Mint gained increasing and somewhat unwelcome attention: rivals attempted industrial espionage, while lobbying with the Government for Boulton&#x27;s mint to be shut down.

Boulton was finally awarded a contract by the Royal Mint on 3 March 1797, after a national financial crisis reached its nadir when the Bank of England suspended convertibility of its notes for gold. The twopenny coins measured exactly an inch and a half across; 16 pennies lined up would reach two feet.
Between 1817 and 1830 the German engineer Dietrich &quot;Diedrich&quot; Uhlhorn invented the Presse Monétaire, a level coin press which became known as the Uhlhorn Press. His steam driven knuckle-lever press made him internationally famous, and over 500 units had been sold by 1840. The advanced construction of the Uhlhorn press proved to be highly satisfactory, and the use of the screw press for general coinage was gradually eliminated.

This new technology was used at the Birmingham Mint, the largest private mint in the world for much of the 19th century, and was further improved at the Taylor and Challen who began to supply complete press room equipment to national mints around the world, such as Sydney Mint, Australia.

By the early 20th century, mints were using electrical power to drive rolls, the advantage being that each pair of rolls could be driven independently without the intervention of cumbrous shafting.

<doc id="391339" wikidata="Q595948" url="?curid=391339" title="Baron Hill (politician)">
<text>Baron Paul Hill (born June 23, 1953) is a retired American politician who served as a U.S. Representative for from 1999 to 2005 and from 2007 to 2011.

A native of Seymour, Indiana, Hill is a Democrat, and as a member of Congress belonged to the conservative-leaning Blue Dog Coalition of that party. Hill&#x27;s district is in the southeastern part of the state, stretching from Bloomington to the Indiana side of the Louisville metropolitan area.

== Early life and education==
Hill attended Seymour High School, where he was a first-team all-state player in basketball and an all-American. He set the record for leading scorer in school history, with 1,724 points. He was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000.

Hill graduated from high school in 1971 and accepted an athletic scholarship to Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, where he graduated in 1975. After graduating from college, Hill moved back to Seymour, Indiana and joined his family&#x27;s business.

==Indiana House of Representatives and 1990 U.S. Senate race==
Hill was a member of the Indiana House of Representatives from 1982 to 1990. Hill chaired the state House Democratic Caucus&#x27; Campaign Committee from 1985 to 1989, and in that position helped Democrats win House elections and secure a majority.

In 1990, as a state representative, Hill ran for the U.S. Senate in the 1990 special election to fill the last two years of Dan Quayle&#x27;s term (Quayle had been elected Vice President). Hill attracted much attention (and earned media) during that race for walking the length of the state (from the Ohio River to Lake Michigan) to meet with voters. Hill ultimately lost to Senator Dan Coats (who the governor had appointed to fill the vacancy), 54% to 46%—a smaller margin than expected.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

===Votes and positions===
During five non-consecutive terms in the United States House of Representatives, Hill was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition of moderate and conservative Democrats. Hill served as the Blue Dogs&#x27; co-chair for communications and later as co-chair for policy.

In 2001, Hill voted for the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). In 2008, Hill said that the law needed to be revamped, saying that he did not object to accountability for schools, but that the act infringed too much on local control and unrealistically required special needs children to meet standardized testing requirements. Hill also said that the federal government had failed to provide an increase in federal school funding, as had been promised when NCLB was passed.

Hill voted in 2002 to authorize the use of the military force against Iraq in 2002, but criticized the George W. Bush administration&#x27;s conduct of the reconstruction of Iraq. In October 2003, Hill said that the 2003 invasion had been well-planned but the subsequent reconstruction had not: &quot;The president did not plan well for winning the peace and for rebuilding the nation.&quot; Hill blasted Bush&#x27;s &quot;go-it-alone&quot; strategy and said that Bush had failed to obtain support from the international community, leading to huge U.S. expenditures that sapped away funding that could otherwise go to domestic priorities such as &quot;homeland security, health care, education and debt reduction.&quot;

In 2007, Hill—along with Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska, a Republican—introduced a measure seeking to increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards to between 32 mpg (7.4 L/100 km) and 35 mpg (6.7 L/100 km) by 2022. The Hill-Terry proposal was more limited than a competing proposal introduced by Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Todd Russell Platts, Republican of Pennsylvania, which sought to raise CAFE standards for combined car-truck fleets to 35 mpg by 2018. The Hill-Terry proposal was supported by the United Auto Workers. and by industry groups such as the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and National Association of Manufacturers, while the Markey-Platts proposal was backed by the Sierra Club and other environmentalist groups. The final energy bill was a compromise that mandated a 35 mpg CAFE standard by 2020.

In 2008, ahead of the Indiana presidential primary, Hill endorsed Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton.

Hill voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (&quot;Wall Street bailout&quot;). Hill supported the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 (Waxman-Markey), a cap-and-trade bill which ultimately did not pass. Hill also voted for the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (an economic stimulus package championed by President Obama) and the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, landmark health care reform legislation.

During his last years in the House, Hill earned a 70 percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT rights advocacy group. Hill supported the repeal of don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell, voted for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2010, and opposed a proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Hill did not campaign for same-sex marriage, however, and did not cosponsor legislation brought by 121 Democrats to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriage. As public attitudes changed, Hill&#x27;s position shifted, and in 2015, while running for Senate, Hill said: &quot;Marriage equality is especially close to my own heart. I’m proud of Hoosiers who are fighting to make sure our friends and neighbors are guaranteed equal rights.&quot;

===Campaigns===

====1998 ====
Hill was elected to the House in November 1998. He defeated Republican Jean Leising, 51% to 48% and Libertarian Diane Merriam, 1%, winning the seat vacated by retiring 34-year incumbent Lee H. Hamilton.

====2000====
Hill was reelected in 2000, with 54 percent of the vote.

====2002====

In 2002, Hill defeated Republican Mike Sodrel with 51 percent of the vote. Sodrel, a New Albany trucking company owner, had 46 percent.

====2004====
In November 2004, in a rematch, Hill lost to Sodrel by a razor-thin margin of about 1,500 votes (about a half of a percentage point). There was a recount following reports of voting irregularities, namely malfunctioning voting machines in at least three counties. Hill gained only about two dozen votes in the recount, however, and conceded the election in early December 2004.

====2006====
Hill won the Democratic nomination in the 9th district in 2006. He was included in the &quot;First Wave&quot; of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee&#x27;s &quot;Red-to-Blue&quot; program.

Texas millionaire Bob J. Perry gave more than $5 million to the Economic Freedom Fund, a 527 group, which included Hill as one of its targets. The group paid for automated &quot;push poll&quot; calls attacking Hill. Such calls were stopped after action by the Indiana Attorney General. &quot;Cook Political Report&quot; rated the race as a toss-up.

Hill won the 2006 election with 50% of the vote; Sodrel received 46% and Libertarian Eric Schansberg 4 percent.

As is the custom for returning members of Congress, the Democrats gave Hill back his seniority. He was named to the Energy and Commerce and Science and Technology committees.

====2008====

In 2008 Hill and Sodrel again fought for the 9th district. The race moved between Likely D to Lean D on the Cook Political Report. Fund raising in 2008 had become more one-sided than in 2006, with Hill far ahead in the numbers game, according to reported income.

Hill defeated Sodrel in the election, 58% to 38%.

====2010====

Hill ran unsuccessfully for reelection, losing to Republican nominee Todd Young on November 2, 2010.

==== Electoral results ====
==Post-congressional career==
In 2011, after leaving Congress, Hill was hired by APCO Worldwide, &quot;as a senior vice president in the company&#x27;s government relations practice and a member of the firm&#x27;s international advisory council.&quot;

APCO represents a number of clients listed in Lobbying Disclosure Act filings. In 2014, Hill left APCO to start his own solo lobbying firm, representing Cook Industries, a company located in his former district.

==2016 election for U.S. Senate==

In 2014, Hill announced he was considering running for Governor in 2016.

Following an announcement by Senator Dan Coats that he would not seek reelection, however, Hill announced on May 15, 2015, that he would seek the open Senate seat as the Democratic nominee. Democratic state Representative Christina Hale considered running for the seat as well, but ultimately decided against it.

Former Governor Evan Bayh, who from 1999 to 2011 served in the Senate in the same seat held by Coats, initially opted against joining the race. Hill therefore ran unopposed for the Democratic nomination, setting up a rematch with Todd Young. However, Hill withdrew from the general election on July 11, 2016, in favor of Bayh, who announced he was entering the race. Young won the general election on November 8, 2016.

==Personal life==
Hill is married to Betty Hill (née Schepman), a public-school math teacher. They have three adult daughters.

Hill is a Methodist and a member of the First United Methodist Church in Seymour.

<doc id="391341" wikidata="Q4833333" url="?curid=391341" title="Año Nuevo State Park">
<text>Año Nuevo State Park is a state park of California, United States, encompassing Año Nuevo Island and Año Nuevo Point, which are known for their pinniped rookeries. Located in San Mateo County, the low, rocky, windswept point juts out into the Pacific Ocean about south of San Francisco and the Golden Gate. Año Nuevo State Natural Reserve, formerly a separate unit of the California state park system, was merged into Año Nuevo State Park in October 2008. The coastal geographic center, or coastal-midpoint of California is located at the northern end of this park at , as the absolute geographic center of California falls at .

The reserve contains a diversity of plant communities, including old growth forest, freshwater marsh, red alder riparian forest and knobcone pine forest. Its four perennial streams support steelhead and coho salmon, and its wetlands are habitat to the rare San Francisco garter snake and California red-legged frog. Cultural resources include the remnants of a prehistoric Native American village site and a number of structures from the 19th century Cascade Ranch. In conjunction with adjacent and nearby public lands, the unit permits the protection of important regional ecological corridors.

The point remains undeveloped, much as Sebastián Vizcaíno saw it from his passing ship in 1603.

==History==
The Quiroste Ohlone people were the first known to inhabit the Año Nuevo area. After Mission Santa Cruz was founded in 1791, the Quiroste population plunged due to the various diseases that the Spanish had brought with them.

The Spanish maritime explorer Sebastian Vizcaino sailed by the point on January 3, 1603. His diarist and chaplain of the expedition, Father Antonio de la Ascensión, named it Punta de Año Nuevo (New Year&#x27;s Point) for the day on which they sighted it in 1603. They had recently stopped in Monterey and had passed Año Nuevo while heading north.

The first European land exploration of Alta California was the Spanish Portolà expedition of 1760–1770. Guided by Vizcaino&#x27;s landmarks as it traveled north along the coast in 1769, the explorers recognized Point Año Nuevo. On the return journey to San Diego, the party camped at Año Nuevo Creek on November 19. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary, &quot;We...halted on a steep rock, in sight of the point which we judged to be Año Nuevo, on the bank of an arroyo which empties into the sea.&quot;

After the mid-19th century, developments occurred, including the development of Año Nuevo Island and agriculture in the surrounding region. Once home to a large population of northern elephant seals, hunters greatly reduced the seal population by overhunting the species. Since the mid-20th century, the seal population has had a rebound and multiplied greatly. Northern elephant seals can be seen today on the wildlife reserve.

Save the Redwoods League purchased a parcel known as Cascade Creek in 2020 that links Año Nuevo with Big Basin Redwoods State Park.

==Pinniped colonies==
Northern elephant seals, California sea lions, sea otters, and other marine mammals come ashore to rest, mate, and give birth in the sand dunes or on the beaches and offshore islands. Hundreds of thousands of people come to witness it each year.

Año Nuevo State Park is the site of one of the largest mainland breeding colonies for the northern elephant seal (another is in Piedras Blancas State Marine Reserve and Marine Conservation Area— south near the town of Cambria and the San Simeon approach to Hearst Castle). The seals attract so much interest that early reservations are needed during the winter breeding season. The males battle for mates on the beaches and the females give birth to their pups on the dunes.

From mid-December through late March, daily access to the reserve is available on guided walks only. Most of the adult seals are gone by mid-March, leaving behind the weaned pups who remain through April. The elephant seals return to Año Nuevo&#x27;s beaches during the spring (females) and summer (males) months to molt, and can be observed during this time through a permit system. Reservations for a guided walk during the breeding season are available by phone.

==Facilities==
A Visitor Center features natural history exhibits and a bookstore offering educational items such as books, postcards and posters. Restrooms, drinking water and picnic tables are available near the Visitor Center only. Food and beverages are not sold at the reserve, although drinking water is available.

The parking lot is just west of California Route 1 at .

The former Cascade Ranch unit of the reserve includes steep unmarked hikes in the coastal hills inland of the highway.

==Adjacent attractions==
Año Nuevo State Marine Conservation Area and Greyhound Rock State Marine Conservation Area are two adjoining marine protected areas off the coast of Año Nuevo State Park. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems.

Pigeon Point Light Station State Historic Park, Butano State Park and numerous other parks and beaches are within of Año Nuevo.

<text>A towhee is any one of a number of species of birds in the genus &quot;Pipilo&quot; or &quot;Melozone&quot; within the family Passerellidae (which also includes American sparrows and juncos).

Towhees typically have longer tails than other Passerellidae. Most species tend to avoid humans, so they are not well-known, though the eastern towhee &quot;P. erythrophthalmus&quot; is bolder. This species, and some others, may be seen in urban parks and gardens.

There has been considerable debate over the taxonomy of towhees. Two species complexes have been identified, the rufous-sided complex (involving &quot;Pipilo erythrophthalmus&quot;, &quot;P. maculatus&quot;, &quot;P. socorroensis&quot;, &quot;P. ocai&quot; and &quot;P. chlorurus&quot;), and the brown towhee complex (involving &quot;Melozone crissalis&quot;, &quot;M. fusca&quot;, &quot;M. aberti&quot; and &quot;M. albicollis&quot;). The distinction of species within these is uncertain and opinions have differed over the years. Modern authorities distinguish all four species in the brown towhee complex, though &quot;M. fusca&quot; and &quot;M. crissalis&quot; were formerly treated as a single species. Hybrids are frequent between some of the species, particularly between the Mexican races of &quot;P. maculatus&quot; (&quot;olive-backed towhee&quot;, &quot;P. m. macronyx&quot;) and &quot;P. ocai&quot;.

<doc id="391345" wikidata="Q217017" url="?curid=391345" title="Other Voices (The Doors album)">
<text>Other Voices is the seventh studio album by the Doors, released by Elektra Records in October 1971. It was the first album released by the band following the death of lead singer Jim Morrison in July 1971 with keyboardist Ray Manzarek and guitarist Robby Krieger sharing lead vocals. Tracks for the album had begun before Morrison&#x27;s death and the band hoped that Morrison would return from Paris to finish them.

==Background and recording==
Following the critical and commercial success of &quot;L.A. Woman&quot; and Jim Morrison&#x27;s death in 1971, the surviving members of the Doors continued as a trio to record their seventh album. Reflecting on the album in 2021, Robby Krieger noted the band&#x27;s difficulty to continue working after Morrison&#x27;s death:

==Later releases==

According to Jac Holzman, &quot;Other Voices&quot; sold approximately 300,000 copies on its original release. &quot;Record World&quot; said that the single &quot;Tightrope Ride&quot; is &quot;a knockout rouser that amply demonstrates the band&#x27;s ability to rock on successfully with other voices.&quot; 

The album was not released on CD until October 23, 2006, by the Timeless Holland label, along with the final Doors album, &quot;Full Circle&quot;. For years, the Doors largely disregarded the last two studio albums that were recorded without Morrison, and had no plans of reissuing the albums on CD. At the time, the Doors stated that they were not in possession of the master tapes, but remastered material from both the albums has appeared on various compilations, most notably the 1997 &quot;Box Set&quot; and the 2000 compilation &quot;The Best of the Doors&quot;. 

On September 27, 2011, The Doors finally gave &quot;Other Voices&quot; (along with &quot;Full Circle&quot;) its first official reissue, though made available only via digital download. The original master tapes were confirmed to have been used in these reissues. On May 29, 2015, it was announced that &quot;Other Voices&quot; and &quot;Full Circle&quot; would be re-released together on a 2-CD set and individually on 180-gram vinyl by Rhino Records on September 4 of that year. The CD set features &quot;Treetrunk&quot;—the B-side of the &quot;Get Up and Dance&quot; single—as its only bonus track.

<text>Pipilo is a genus of birds in the American sparrow family Passerellidae. It is one of two genera containing birds with the common name towhee.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pipilo&quot; was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816 with the eastern towhee as the type species. The name &quot;Pipilo&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;bunting&quot; from &quot;pipilare&quot; &quot;to chirp&quot;. Within the New World sparrow family Passerellidae, the genus &quot;Pipilo&quot; is sister to the larger genus &quot;Atlapetes&quot;.

<doc id="391350" wikidata="Q7444875" url="?curid=391350" title="Secure key issuing cryptography">
<text>Secure key issuing is a variant of Identity-based cryptography that reduces the level of trust that needs to be placed in a trusted third party by spreading the trust across multiple third parties. 

In addition to the normally transmitted information the user supplies what is known as &quot;blinding&quot; information
which can be used to blind (hide) data so that only the user can later retrieve it. The third party provides a &quot;blinded&quot; partial private key, which is then passed on to several other third parties in order, each adding another part of the key before blinding it and passing it on. Once the user gets the key, they (and only they) can unblind it and retrieve their full private key. After that, the system becomes the same as identity-based cryptography.

If all third parties cooperate, they can recover the private key, so key escrow problems arise only if all third parties are untrustworthy. In other areas of information security, this is known as a cascade. If every member of the cascade is independent and the cascade is large then the system may be considered trustworthy in actual practice.

The paper below states, &quot;Compared with certificate-based cryptography, ID-based cryptography is advantageous in key management since key distribution and revocation are not required.&quot; However, this poses a problem in long-lived environments where an identity (such as an email address) may shift in ownership over time, and old keys need to be revoked and new keys associated with that identity provided to a new party.

<doc id="391352" wikidata="Q5065067" url="?curid=391352" title="Certificate-based encryption">
<text>Certificate-based encryption is a system in which a certificate authority uses ID-based cryptography to produce a certificate. This system gives the users both implicit and explicit certification, the certificate can be used as a conventional certificate (for signatures, etc.), but also implicitly for the purpose of encryption.

==Example==
A user &quot;Alice&quot; can doubly encrypt a message using another user&#x27;s (&quot;Bob&quot;) public key and his (&quot;Bob&#x27;s&quot;) identity.

This means that the user (&quot;Bob&quot;) cannot decrypt it without a currently valid certificate and also that the certificate authority cannot decrypt the message as they don&#x27;t have the user&#x27;s private key (i.e., there is no implicit escrow as with ID-based cryptography, as the double encryption means they cannot decrypt it solely with the information they have). Certificate is the trust between two parties.

==Key revocation==
Key revocation can be added to the system by requiring a new certificate to be issued as frequently as the level of security requires. Because the certificate is &quot;public information&quot;, it does not need to be transmitted over a secret channel. The downside of this is the requirement for regular communication between users and the certificate authority, which means the certificate authority is more vulnerable to electronic attacks (such as denial-of-service attacks) and also that such attacks could effectively stop the system from working. This risk can be partially but not completely reduced by having a hierarchy of multiple certificate authorities.

==Practical applications==
The best example of practical use of certificate-based encryption is Content Scrambling System (CSS), which is used to encode DVD movies in such a way as to make them playable only in a part of the world where they are sold. However, the fact that the region decryption key is stored on the hardware level in the DVD players substantially weakens this form of protection.

<text>Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve is a state-protected reserve of California, United States, harboring the most consistent blooms of California poppies, the state flower. The reserve is located in the rural west side of Antelope Valley in northern Los Angeles County, west of Lancaster. To the north is Kern County. The reserve is at an elevation ranging from above sea level, in the Mojave Desert climate zone. The reserve is administered by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Other wildflowers within the reserve include the Owl&#x27;s Clover, Lupine, Goldfields, Cream Cups and Coreopsis.

==The Reserve==
The intense blooming season for the California Poppy usually falls within late winter to early spring, during the months of mid-February through mid-May. Blooming seasons are dependent on the amount of rainfall during the winter to early spring seasons. Within the reserve, there are of trails, including a paved section for wheelchair access, which traverse the poppy fields.

In order to keep the fields in a strictly natural state, California State Parks does not water or stimulate the flowers. The park service also excludes sheep and cattle from grazing the hillsides. Until the early 1970s, sheep once grazed the buttes in the western Antelope Valley. Pronghorn grazed long before then, until the railroad arrived in 1876. With the exception of service dogs, pets are prohibited from the reserve. Under California state law, visitors are also prohibited from taking flowers from the reserve.

Since 1994, controlled fires have been used to regulate dead brush, exotic species and litter within the reserve.

The reserve is located east of Arthur B. Ripley Desert Woodland State Park.

<doc id="391354" wikidata="Q5065118" url="?curid=391354" title="Certificateless cryptography">
<text>Certificateless cryptography is a variant of ID-based cryptography intended to prevent the key escrow problem. Ordinarily, keys are generated by a certificate authority or a key generation center (KGC) who is given complete power and is implicitly trusted. To prevent a complete breakdown of the system in the case of a compromised KGC, the key generation process is split between the KGC and the user. The KGC first generates a key pair, where the private key is now the partial private key of the system. The remainder of the key is a random value generated by the user, and is never revealed to anyone, not even the KGC. All cryptographic operations by the user are performed by using a complete private key which involves both the KGC&#x27;s partial key, and the user&#x27;s random secret value.

==History==
The authors, Al-Riyami and Paterson, aimed to address the issue of key custody in the identity-based model, specifically targeting the encryption protocol developed by Boneh and Franklin (2003). Their proposed approach, Certificate-Based Public Key Cryptography (CL-PKC), seeks to enhance two existing models. Compared to traditional Public Key Cryptography (PKC), CL-PKC simplifies the structure by eliminating the need for digital certificates. In contrast to the identity-based model (ID-PKC), it improves security by removing the requirement for key escrow. To develop this hybrid model, which lies between identity-based systems and conventional PKC with digital certificates, Al-Riyami and Paterson drew inspiration from Girault’s self-certified public key model (1991) and Boneh and Franklin’s identity-based scheme (2001).

== Key Distribution ==

One disadvantage of this is that the identity information no longer forms the entire public key. Meaning, the user&#x27;s public key is not discoverable from only the user&#x27;s identity string and the KGC&#x27;s public key. Thus, the user&#x27;s public key must be published or otherwise obtained by other users. One advantage of the system, is that it is possible to verify that any such obtained public key belongs to the stated identity string. (In other words, the method of distributing the user&#x27;s public key does not have to be secure.) The identity string and the KGC&#x27;s public key can be used to verify that the obtained public key belongs to the identity string. (It can be verified that the obtained public key was generated from the identity string, the KGC&#x27;s private key and some unknown value). Note that multiple public / private key pairs can be generated for any identity string, but attackers would not have access to the KGC&#x27;s private key in the creation process.

== Encryption and Decryption == 

To encrypt a message to another user, three pieces of information are needed: 1) the recipient&#x27;s public key and 2) identity string, and also 3) the KGC&#x27;s public information (public key). The identity string and the KGC&#x27;s public key are used to verify that the recipient&#x27;s public key belongs to the recipient (was generated from the identity string and the KGC&#x27;s public key). To decrypt, a user just needs to use their private key.

== Security ==

For tight security, a certificateless system has to prove its security against two types of adversaries:
* Type 1 Adversary- Refers to any third party who can fake the user&#x27;s public keys, corresponding to obtaining the user&#x27;s random secret value.
* Type 2 Adversary- Refers to a compromised or malicious KGC, who has access to the partial public and private keys of all users.

<doc id="391355" wikidata="Q252751" url="?curid=391355" title="An American Prayer">
<text>An American Prayer is the ninth and final studio album by the American rock band the Doors. Following the death of Jim Morrison and the band&#x27;s breakup, the surviving members of the Doors reconvened to set several of Morrison&#x27;s spoken word recordings to music. It was the only album by the Doors to be nominated for a Grammy Award in the &quot;Spoken Word&quot; category.

Keyboardist Ray Manzarek perceived &quot;An American Prayer&quot; as being divided into five parts, with the first covering Morrison&#x27;s childhood, the second covering his high school years, the third concerning &quot;the young poet, stoned on a rooftop with acid dreams&quot;, the fourth covering his musical career and finally the fifth being a &quot;final summation in a way, of the man&#x27;s entire life and his philosophy.&quot;

==Background==

The Doors formed in 1965 and released six studio albums before singer/lyricist Jim Morrison&#x27;s death in July 1971. The surviving band members (keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore) recorded two additional albums as a trio, but broke up in 1973.

Morrison had originally recorded some of his poetry between 1969 and 1970; the first sessions took place in either Elektra&#x27;s recording studios or Sunset Sound Studios in Hollywood, California, while the last recordings were made in Village Recorders, West Los Angeles. These drafts were completed in two stints, first in the spring of 1969, and the other in December 1970. The first session included poems like &quot;Bird of Prey&quot;, &quot;Under Waterfall&quot; and &quot;Orange County&quot;, sung a cappella by Morrison with the latter cut featuring piano played by him. By January 1971, after the completion of these recordings, Morrison had developed some concepts for the album cover art, and was in correspondence with artist T. E. Breitenbach to design this cover in the form of a triptych. Prior to leaving for Paris in March 1971, Morrison had also approached composer Lalo Schifrin as a possible collaborator on the music to accompany the poetry, instead of the other members of the Doors.

In 1978, Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore reunited to record the music for &quot;An American Prayer&quot;. On November 19, 1978, in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Ray Manzarek explained, &quot;We did this album to show the side of Jim which has been underrated all these years.&quot; Morrison&#x27;s friend Frank Lisciandro served as one of the co-producers of the album, while Pamela Courson&#x27;s father &quot;Corky&quot; Courson was also involved in the record. According to the book &quot;Break on Through&quot;, when recording the music, the three Doors members decided to produce a different musical style from Morrison&#x27;s original vision of orchestral music on the project. Other pieces of music and spoken word recorded by the Doors and Morrison were also used in the audio collage, such as dialogue from Morrison&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;, snippets from jam sessions, excerpts from interviews, and featuring sections from &quot;The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)&quot; and &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot;. Densmore devised an early use of synthesized drums for the former.

==Artwork==
After Morrison had done his recordings, he asked American artist T. E. Breitenbach to design the cover for the album. He sent him a letter about his suggestions for the concept:

After Morrison&#x27;s death however, the album&#x27;s producers were unaware of his intention to use the painting, and used for the front and back cover photos taken by Edmund Teske and Joel Brodsky respectively. The existence of this lost painting collaboration came to light actually decades later, when the artist himself posted it on his website.

==Release and reception==

&quot;An American Prayer&quot; was released on November 17, 1978, as &quot;a Jim Morrison Album&quot; with &quot;Music by the Doors&quot;. It initially sold approximately 250,000 copies, making it the best-selling spoken word album at the time. According to John Haeny, it later exceeded the one million copies sold. The album included a composite live version of &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, which received some radio airplay on rock radio stations. The album peaked at number 54 on the US charts. It was also nominated for the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

Despite receiving a RIAA platinum certification in the US, &quot;An American Prayer&quot; received mixed reviews and still divides critics. When the album was originally released, longtime Doors&#x27; producer Paul A. Rothchild castigated it as a &quot;RAPE of Jim Morrison.&quot; Rothchild claimed that he had heard all of the reels of master tapes from both the 1969 and the 1970 poetry sessions, and insisted that the three remaining Doors failed to realize Morrison&#x27;s original intent for an audio presentation of the poetry. In a review published in &quot;Creem&quot; magazine in January 1979, musician Patti Smith felt that the record had some &quot;certain flaws&quot;, but commended the fact that it &quot;documents a fragment of the passion of Jim Morrison&quot;, adding that, &quot;&quot;An American Prayer&quot; has been pieced together delicately with obsessive devotion.&quot; John Haeny (who recorded the original session tapes with Morrison in 1970) has written in an essay on July 23, 2013, &quot;I want people to understand that this album was made by those people who were closest to Jim, both personally and artistically. Everyone had the best intentions&quot; and that, &quot;I believe Jim would be pleased. Jim would have understood our motivation and appreciated our dedication and heartfelt handling of his work.&quot;

In his 1981 review, Robert Christgau rated &quot;An American Prayer&quot; &quot;C&quot; (which is about average on his scale). He praised the music accompaniment by the surviving members, but criticized Morrison as &quot;a bad poet&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the record as &quot;intriguing&quot; but &quot;suitable mainly for Morrison fanatics.&quot; On the occasion of the 1995 reissue release, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; journalist David Browne similarly wrote that &quot;An American Prayer&quot; is &quot;primarily for those who place great weight on Jim Morrison.&quot; More recently, Vik Iyengar of AllMusic found the album &quot;interesting&quot;, but concluded that it&#x27;s &quot;not for everyone, but is a must-own for Doors completists and fans of Jim Morrison&#x27;s poetry.&quot; Fellow AllMusic critic Matthew Greenwald in contrast, lauded it as an &quot;excellent and underrated&quot; album. In 2021, &quot;Far Out Magazine&quot; described it as &quot;astonishing&quot;, and that, &quot;An American Prayer&quot; shows &quot;a side of Morrison that was rarely seen in public, and which is still hugely underrated: his power as a poet.&quot;

== Track listing ==
Poetry, lyrics and stories are written and recited by Jim Morrison; the music is composed by Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore. Details are taken from the original 1978 US Elektra Records release.

<text>The Antelope Valley Indian Museum State Historic Park is a state historic park of California, United States, interpreting Native American cultures of the Great Basin and surrounding regions. The park and its grounds are situated on the Antelope Valley&#x27;s rural east side in northern Los Angeles County, California.

The museum contains the combined collections of H. Arden Edwards and subsequent owner and anthropology student Grace Oliver. The exhibits represent and interpret Native Americans groups, both aboriginal and contemporary, of the Southwest, Great Basin, and Californian cultural regions. A number of the artifacts on display are rare or one-of-a-kind items.
The museum was originally constructed by homesteader/artist H. Arden Edwards in 1928. The chalet-style structure was built over the rock formation of Piute Butte in the Mojave Desert. The unusual folk art structure, originally used as a home, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Demonstrations and special events==
Joshua Cottage features a &quot;touch table&quot; room where visitors can experience food grinding and processing techniques, or learn how earlier Native Americans started fires using sticks or bow drills.

Outside the museum is a self-guided nature trail, a picnic area, and an outdoor ceremonial arena. Occasionally guest Native American groups perform traditional dances and other programs. An annual opening event each fall features a traditional ground blessing ceremony. There are also Native American artists demonstrating and selling their work, Native American food, and special activities for children. The museum also sponsors periodic educational seminars.

<text>The American Radio Relay League (ARRL) is the largest membership association of amateur radio enthusiasts in the United States. ARRL is a non-profit organization and was co-founded on April 6, 1914, by Hiram Percy Maxim and Clarence D. Tuska of Hartford, Connecticut. The ARRL represents the interests of amateur radio operators before federal regulatory bodies, provides technical advice and assistance to amateur radio enthusiasts, supports a number of educational programs and sponsors emergency communications service throughout the country. The ARRL has approximately 161,000 members. In addition to members in the US, the organization claims over 7,000 members in other countries. The ARRL publishes many books and a monthly membership journal called &quot;QST&quot;.

The ARRL is the primary representative organization of amateur radio operators to the US government. It performs this function by lobbying the US Congress and the Federal Communications Commission. The ARRL is also the international secretariat of the International Amateur Radio Union, which performs a similar role internationally, advocating for amateur radio interests before the International Telecommunication Union and the World Administrative Radio Conferences.

The organization is governed by a member-elected, volunteer Board of Directors. Each director serves a three-year term and represents the members within their particular region of the country. The national headquarters facilities are located in Newington, Connecticut. Along with the administrative headquarters, the site is home to amateur radio station W1AW. The ARRL Field Organization carries out local and regional activities across the United States.

== Governance ==

The ARRL is governed by a member-elected, volunteer Board of Directors. The organization divides its membership into 15 Divisions, each representing a portion of the country. One Director and one vice-director are elected by the members of each Division to serve a three-year term. Director elections are staggered so that one-third of the Directors and Vice Directors are up for election each year. The Board of Directors manages policy direction for the organization as a whole. The Board of Directors appoints an executive committee, led by the President and consisting of members of the ARRL Board of Directors, to make policy decisions between full Board meetings. ARRL&#x27;s officers manage day-to-day administrative operation of the organization, led by the Chief Executive Officer. These paid officers hold their positions as long as the Board of Directors approve but have no vote on the Board.

Local and regional operational activities of the American Radio Relay League are carried out through its Field Organization. The organization divides the 15 Divisions into 71 separate geographic regions called Sections. Each Section has a similar team of one elected, volunteer Section Manager and several volunteer positions. Section Managers are elected by the members living within the section for a two-year term. The Section Manager appoints a team of volunteers. A Section Manager may optionally appoint one or more Assistant Section Managers.

An important function of the ARRL Field Organization is organizing emergency communications in the event of civil or natural disaster. The ARRL&#x27;s Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) program is organized through the ARRL Field Organization. Each Section of the Field Organization has an appointed Section Emergency Coordinator. The ARES organization supports training, establishes Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with governmental and relief agencies, and organizes regular practice exercises.

ARES has provided essential supplemental emergency communications innumerable times throughout the league&#x27;s history. In 1989, hundreds of amateurs responded to the Loma Preita earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area putting in over 3000 volunteer hours in the first week. In 2005, ARES, with hundreds of volunteer amateur radio operators, provided key communications assistance to recovery organizations and officials coordinating Hurricane Katrina disaster relief.

Over 2,000 Amateur Radio clubs are members of the ARRL Affiliated Club Program.

== History ==
=== 1914–1920 ===
In 1914, Hiram Percy Maxim of Hartford, Connecticut, was a prominent businessman, engineer, and inventor (notably of the Maxim Silencer). He was also an active radio amateur, with one of the best-equipped stations in the Hartford area. One night in April he attempted to send a message to another ham in Springfield, Massachusetts. He had a one-kilowatt station (call 1WH), and Springfield was only away, well within his normal range. He was unable to make contact, and remembering that he knew another ham in Windsor Locks, about halfway, he asked him to relay the message. At that time, the maximum reliable range of a station was a few hundred miles, and so Maxim realized that a formally organized relay system would be of tremendous use to amateurs.

Maxim was a member of the Radio Club of Hartford, and he presented a plan for the organization of an &quot;American Radio Relay League&quot; at its April 1914 meeting. The club agreed to sponsor the development of such an organization. Maxim and Clarence D. Tuska, the secretary of the Hartford Radio Club, developed application forms and sent them out to every amateur station they could think of. By September 1914 they had over 230 stations on the roster.

In early 1915, disagreements began to surface as to the role of the Hartford Radio Club in the new organization, and in February the ARRL split off from the club and incorporated under Connecticut law. Finances were shaky, and most of the income came from sales of booklets, maps and message blanks. By March 1915, there were 600 stations on the roster, and due to improvements in equipment and operating ability, some of the better stations were claiming communication ranges of up to a thousand miles. It was apparent that the ARRL now needed some kind of bulletin to stay in touch with its members. Maxim and Tuska agreed to personally finance it, and in December 1915 the first, 16-page issue of &quot;QST&quot; was sent free to all members. Further issues would be supplied through subscription at $1 per year.

In 1916, with ARRL membership nearing a thousand, Maxim set up six trunk lines of relay stations, both east–west and north–south, and individual managers were appointed. Messages were now being relayed over longer and longer distances, and in February 1917 a message was sent from New York to Los Angeles and an answer received in one hour and twenty minutes.

In 1917, the ARRL was reorganized to a more formal organization. A constitution was adopted, twelve directors and four officers were elected (including President Maxim and Secretary Tuska), and membership was opened to anyone interested in radio. No sooner had this happened than all amateurs received a letter from the Department of Commerce ordering them off the air and to dismantle all antennas, because the United States had entered World War I.

During the war the ARRL facilitated the recruitment of amateurs into communications positions with the armed services, but had little else to do since all civilian experimentation with radio equipment was prohibited. In November 1918 the Armistice was signed, but Congress introduced bills to put all radio operations in the United States under control of the Navy. The ARRL strongly opposed the bills. Maxim testified before Congressional committees and the League organized an effective grass roots campaign with thousands of individuals contacting their congressmen in opposition. The bills were defeated, and in April 1919 amateurs were permitted to put up antennas again, but only for receiving.

Meanwhile, the League needed reorganization. A financing plan consisting of selling bonds to members was adopted and about $7500 was raised. &quot;QST&quot; was purchased from its owner, Clarence Tuska. ARRL continued to lobby Congress for the resumption of transmitting privileges, and after a number of protests and appeals, amateur radio was fully restored in November 1919.

=== 1920–1964 ===

The 1920s saw tremendous technical growth in radio. Pushed both by wartime demands and by the growing commercialization of radio, equipment rapidly improved. The use of spark gap technology quickly disappeared as the more efficient continuous wave system of generating radio-frequency energy and transmitting Morse Code became standard. In 1923 a two-way contact between Connecticut and France bridged the Atlantic Ocean for the first time.

With government uncertainty as to how to allocate both commercial and amateur frequencies, the ARRL kept discipline in amateur ranks so that spectrum was not unnecessarily occupied. They worked with Washington and the result was that amateurs received the orderly series of harmonic frequency bands that they largely hold today (originally 1.8, 3.5, 7, 14, 28, and 56 MHz; other bands have since been added and the 56 MHz allocation was changed to 50 MHz).

Other activities during this time included transcontinental relays to quickly move messages across the United States, communications assistance in several emergencies, and encouragement for an amateur radio operator on an Arctic expedition of Donald B. MacMillan—perhaps the first beginnings of DXpeditions. The League also began to act in an advisory capacity for the American delegations at international radio conferences. In 1925 the International Amateur Radio Union was formed, and it remains headquartered at Newington. The long-running Frankford Radio Club (W3BKX) was founded around 1927 and affiliated with ARRL in 1930.

In the 1930s the Great Depression took its toll on development. Hiram Percy Maxim died in 1936. His callsign W1AW was licensed to the League and remains in use as the first-ever Memorial Station. In 1937 the DXCC Award, for working 100 countries, was established, and it still is the premier achievement in amateur radio. Operators, often under the ARRL Emergency Corps, helped at numerous disasters. The League&#x27;s &quot;QST&quot; magazine acted as a forum for experimenters in voice, television, and very high frequency work.
During World War II, US amateurs were again told to leave the air. The ARRL developed the government-approved War Emergency Radio Service, a Civil Defense system. Thousands of League members, and many thousands more who received technical training through its publications, served in the conflict. In late 1945 the bands began to reopen. The end of the war brought a tremendous expansion of amateur radio as large amounts of war surplus equipment was available, many recently trained operators became active, and experiments began in such newly developed modes as single sideband and microwaves.

The 1950s saw the continued development of amateur radio and consequent growth of the ARRL. New civil defense systems and procedures were developed by the League, including regular communications between isolated service members and their families. Equipment rapidly improved, although there was some trouble with television interference. The ARRL and many of its members cooperated with scientists during the International Geophysical Year in 1957, measuring the effects of solar activity on propagation in the VHF band.

A controversial idea was originated in 1961 when the League encouraged &quot;incentive licensing&quot;, which sought reversion to the principle that higher levels of license privileges should require higher levels of demonstrated knowledge and CW skill but took away some amateur privileges until licensees requalified at higher levels; &quot;incentives&quot; are still in effect and only holders of the highest class of license (Amateur Extra) maintain all amateur privileges. By 1964 the positive influence of the ARRL was so evident that the United States issued a commemorative postage stamp on its 50th anniversary. As the League prepared for the future a new headquarters building was opened at Newington.

=== 1965–present ===
In May, June, and July 2024, various ARRL online systems (including the Logbook of the World and its educational website) went unavailable. The organization didn&#x27;t admit that the outage was caused by ransomware until it filed legally-mandated notifications of the data breach on July 11, more than two months after the breach started on May 3.

In August 2024, the organization confirmed that it paid a million dollar ransom to resolve the malware attack.

=== Presidential terms ===
Sixteen radio amateurs have led the ARRL as president.
== Regulatory advocacy ==
The ARRL has opposed regulatory support for Broadband over Power Lines, arguing that the power lines will radiate interfering radio energy, impeding amateur radio activities. The League has filed several interference reports with the FCC. The ARRL sued the FCC, claiming that the FCC violated the Administrative Procedure Act in creating its rules pertaining to BPL. On April 25, 2008, a US Court of Appeals agreed with the ARRL that the FCC violated the APA, especially by redacting data from the public that could have shed doubt on the FCC&#x27;s decision. &quot;It is one thing for the Commission to give notice and make available for comment the studies on which it relied in formulating the rule while explaining its non-reliance on certain parts,&quot; D.C. Circuit Judge Judith Rogers wrote. &quot;It is quite another thing to provide notice and an opportunity for comment on only those parts of the studies that the Commission likes best.&quot;

== Services ==

The American Radio Relay League offers several services to members that support their on-air operations. For members with an interest in DXing, the organization operates both incoming and out-going QSL bureaus for the exchange of QSL cards with stations in other countries. Staff at the organization headquarters maintain and operates station W1AW, the Hiram Percy Maxim Memorial Station, as a living memorial to the &quot;Father of Organized Amateur Radio&quot;. The W1AW station is used for regular Morse code training transmissions for those wishing to learn and also broadcasts a variety of bulletins of interest to radio amateurs. The ARRL/VEC (Volunteer Examiner Coordinator) sponsors amateur radio license examinations for the three classes of U.S. amateur license. License classes and examinations are held in various locations throughout the year. Although the FCC currently recognizes 14 different organizations as VECs, the VEC sponsored by the ARRL oversees about two-thirds of all U.S. amateur radio license examinations.

=== Publications ===

The ARRL provides dozens of publications and journals to both members and non-members. &quot;QST&quot; is the organization&#x27;s monthly membership journal, named after a Morse code Q signal that means &quot;calling all stations&quot;. The organization also publishes two bimonthly magazines of special interest: &quot;QEX&quot; for radio electronics experimenters, and the &quot;National Contest Journal&quot; for contesting enthusiasts. The ARRL publishes various technical books and online courses. Members of the organization also have access to a special Members Only section of the ARRL web site that includes technical documents, expanded product reviews of amateur radio equipment, expanded contesting information, and a searchable database of all league publications. A flagship annual publication, The &quot;Radio Amateur&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, has been published since 1926. The ARRL also publishes a series of manuals designed to assist interested persons in obtaining an amateur radio license or upgrading to a higher class of license.

=== Contests ===

The ARRL sponsors numerous amateur radio contests throughout the year with the biggest of these being November Sweepstakes and the International DX Contest. Other contests and sponsored operating events include Straight Key Night, VHF Sweepstakes, UHF Contest, and 10 GHz and Up Contest. The ARRL also participates as a Headquarters station for the IARU HF World Championship. Field Day is an annual event organized by the ARRL that includes both a competitive element as well as an emphasis on emergency communications readiness and the promotion of amateur radio.

== Controversy ==
Criticisms of ARRL have included its support for less strict licensing requirements in the 2000s, which opponents consider a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of amateur radio or making it more like CB radio, moves allegedly made to gain additional membership. Other critics have felt almost the opposite, however, arguing that the ARRL was slow to lobby for the removal or the easing of the Morse code proficiency requirements of the various license classes, a &quot;conservatism&quot; keeping otherwise qualified people out of amateur radio and thus threatening its future.

Other critics have cited ARRL&#x27;s support for segmentation of the HF amateur bands in the U.S. by bandwidth, rather than by mode, which some have claimed gives preference to users of the Winlink system and manufacturer-specific proprietary modes such as Pactor 3, DSTAR, and Wide-coverage Internet Repeater Enhancement System (WIRES). Regulation by bandwidth favors these proprietary technologies at the expense of narrowband and open-standard digital modes (such as JT65, PSK31, RTTY, and CW).

Many Amateur Radio operators who are seeking to develop and experiment with new technology see the ARRL as backing down too quickly on the regulation by bandwidth issue. FCC rulings on the new soundcard mode called ROS point to the need to drop regulations that hinder experimentation and impede the development of narrowband techniques on the bands where they are most needed

An ARRL decision on November 14, 2017 to censure a member of its board of directors drew strong criticism from many Amateur Radio operators. Numerous operators expressed concern that this decision profoundly undermines the principles of representational democracy and of openness and transparency. A December 2017 white paper critical of the ARRL&#x27;s actions was published online by CQ. This censure was rescinded by the ARRL Board of Directors at its next board meeting, in July 2019.

== Elser-Mathes Cup ==
The Elser-Mathes Cup was created in 1928 by U.S. Amateurs Fred Johnson Elser (W6FB/W7OX) and Stanley M. Mathes (7OE/K1CY) to be awarded for the &quot;First Amateur Two-Way Communication Earth &amp; Mars&quot;. The cup is a Philippine Igorot wood carving, a bowl supported by two standing figures.

==Organization==
In the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) and the Radio Amateurs of Canada (RAC), the Section Manager is an elected volunteer who implements and manages programs in the section. The Section Manager is elected by the members of the organization who reside in the section and holds office for a two-year term. There are no term limits.

For each of the section&#x27;s activities, the Section Manager appoints individuals to oversee the activities. These individuals are collectively referred to as &quot;the cabinet&quot;. 
Cabinet positions include:
* Assistant Section Managers 
* Affiliated Club Coordinator
* Bulletin Manager
* Official Observer Coordinator
* Public Information Coordinator
* Section Emergency Coordinator
* Section Traffic Manager
* Section Youth Coordinator
* State Government Liaison
* Technical Coordinator

The Section Manager also appoints volunteers to serve within these program areas. The volunteers in any given Section serve at the pleasure of the Section Manager. The Section Manager also assists members with questions, issues or problems dealing with the organization&#x27;s products and services; maintains liaison with the frequency coordinating body in the jurisdiction; maintains a relationship with the local field office of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)(US only), and maintains communications with members in the section via email bulletins, web pages, and personal visits to Amateur Radio club meetings, hamfests and conventions.

There are currently 71 sections in the ARRL, (United States) and 12 sections in the RAC (Canada).

An Affiliated Club Coordinator is the assistant to the Section Manager for radio club matters. One ACC is appointed in each section by the Section Manager to encourage club affiliation with the national organization on a section-wide basis.

The Section Traffic Manager is appointed by the Section Manager to supervise and coordinate traffic handling efforts within the National Traffic System and the section.

The Section Emergency Coordinator is the assistant to the Section Manager for amateur radio emergency communications preparedness. The SEC is appointed by the Section Manager.

<doc id="391373" wikidata="Q465354" url="?curid=391373" title="Hiram Percy Maxim">
<text>Hiram Percy Maxim (September 2, 1869 – February 17, 1936) was an American radio pioneer and inventor, and co-founder (with Clarence D. Tuska) of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL). Hiram Percy Maxim is credited with inventing and selling the first commercially successful firearm silencer, and also with developing mufflers for internal combustion engines.

==Early years==
He was the son of Sir Hiram Maxim, inventor of the Maxim Machine gun. He was the nephew of Hudson Maxim, an inventor of explosives and ballistic propellants. He had two sisters, Florence Maxim, who married George Albert Cutter, and Adelaide Maxim, who married Eldon Joubert, Ignace Paderewski&#x27;s piano tuner. In 1875, the family moved from Brooklyn, New York, to Fanwood, New Jersey, with his father joining the rest of the family on weekends. At age 17, Hiram was a mechanical engineering graduate, class of 1886, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (then a two-year course). He went to work for various electric utility companies in Boston.

Beginning in 1892, Maxim worked at the American Projectile Company of Lynn, Massachusetts, and tinkered nights on his own internal combustion engine. He admitted his ignorance of engine developments in Germany by Maybach, Daimler, and Benz, and he later explained that he &quot;was staggered at the amount of time required to build one small engine.&quot; Furthermore, he was appalled once he finally achieved combustion. The engine &quot;shook and trembled and rattled and clattered, spat oil, fire, smoke, and smell, and to a person who disliked machinery naturally, and who had been brought up to the fine elegance and perfection of fine horse carriages, it was revolting.&quot;

In early 1895, Maxim visited Colonel Albert Pope in Hartford which led to his being hired for the Motor Vehicle Division of the Pope Manufacturing Company. His vehicle was not ready in time for the Times-Herald race in November, but Maxim was able to get to Chicago and serve as an umpire. He rode with the Morris and Salom entry, the Electrobat II.

In 1899, with Maxim at the controls, the Pope Columbia, a gasoline-powered automobile, won the first closed-circuit automobile race in the U.S. at Branford, Connecticut. Columbia continued to produce gasoline cars until 1913, and was also a major manufacturer of early electric automobiles and trucks.

From 1902 through 1909, Maxim was largely focused on inventing, building, marketing, and selling firearm silencers. He also developed mufflers for internal combustion engines using much the same technology.

==Marriage and family==
He married Josephine Hamilton, the daughter of the former Maryland Governor William T. Hamilton December 21, 1898, in Hagerstown, Maryland. They lived in Hartford, and had a son, Hiram Hamilton Maxim, and a daughter, Percy Hamilton Maxim, who married John Glessner Lee (grandson of John J. Glessner). The John J. Glessner House designed by Henry Hobson Richardson is now a Chicago landmark.

Percy Maxim Lee (1906–2002) was president of the League of Women Voters from 1950–1958 and was appointed by President Kennedy to the Consumer Advisory Council, which she later chaired. She advocated for debates between presidential candidates and testified in the U.S. Senate against Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1955.

==Accomplishments==
===Firearm and auto industries===
Hiram Percy Maxim is usually credited with inventing and selling the first commercially successful firearm silencer around 1902, receiving a patent for it on March 30, 1909. Maxim gave his device the trademarked name &quot;Maxim Silencer&quot;, and they were regularly advertised in sporting goods magazines. The muffler for internal combustion engines was developed in parallel with the firearm silencer by Maxim in the early 20th century, using many of the same techniques to provide quieter-running engines, and in many English-speaking countries automobile mufflers are called silencers.

===Radio===
He created the American Radio Relay League (ARRL) in 1914 as a response to the lack of an organized group of &quot;relay&quot; stations to pass messages via amateur radio. Relaying messages allowed them to be sent farther than any single station&#x27;s reach at the time. He originally had the amateur call signs SNY, 1WH, 1ZM, (after World War I) 1AW, and later W1AW, which is now the ARRL Headquarters club station call sign. His rotary spark-gap transmitter &quot;Old Betsy&quot; has a place of honor at the ARRL Headquarters. The ARRL presents an annual award named for Maxim to a radio amateur and ARRL member under the age of 21.

===Cinema===
Maxim founded the Amateur Cinema League in New York in 1926; he was elected president. The Amateur Cinema League published a monthly journal, &quot;Movie Makers&quot;.

===Literature===
Maxim wrote the book &quot;Life&#x27;s Place in the Cosmos,&quot; published in 1933, an overview of contemporary science that surmised life existed outside of earth; as well as two books published in 1936: &quot;A Genius in the Family: Sir Hiram Stevens Maxim Through a Small Son&#x27;s Eyes&quot; an amusing account of his youth, and &quot;Horseless Carriage Days&quot; wherein he recounted his days as an automobile pioneer. 

==Death==
Hiram Percy Maxim was on a trip by rail in February 1936 from his home in Hartford, Connecticut, to Flagstaff, Arizona, to visit the Lowell Observatory. He fell ill and was taken from the train to a hospital in La Junta, Colorado, where he died the following day, February 17, 1936. Hiram P. Maxim was buried in the Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown, Maryland, in the Hamilton family plot belonging to his wife&#x27;s family.

==In popular culture==
Maxim&#x27;s aforementioned autobiography of his youth, &quot;A Genius in the Family&quot; was adapted in 1946 into a comedy-drama film produced by Universal Pictures titled, &quot;So Goes My Love&quot; while the UK release used the same title as the book. Bobby Driscoll plays Maxim in the film, with Don Ameche and Myrna Loy playing his parents, Hiram Stephens Maxim and Jane Bidden Maxim.

<doc id="391378" wikidata="Q465108" url="?curid=391378" title="Classic of Poetry">
<text>The Classic of Poetry, also Shijing or Shih-ching, translated variously as the Book of Songs, Book of Odes, or simply known as the Odes or Poetry (; &quot;Shī&quot;), is the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry, comprising 305 works dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC. It is one of the &quot;Five Classics&quot; traditionally said to have been compiled by Confucius, and has been studied and memorized by scholars in China and neighboring countries over two millennia. It is also a rich source of &quot;chengyu&quot; (four-character classical idioms) that are still a part of learned discourse and even everyday language in modern Chinese. Since the Qing dynasty, its rhyme patterns have also been analysed in the study of Old Chinese phonology.

== Name ==
Early references refer to the anthology as the &quot;300 Poems&quot; (&quot;shi&quot;). &quot;The Odes&quot; first became known as a &quot;jīng&quot;, or a &quot;classic book&quot;, in the canonical sense, as part of the Han dynasty&#x27;s official adoption of Confucianism as the guiding principle of Chinese society. The same word &quot;shi&quot; later became a generic term for poetry. In English, lacking an exact equivalent for the Chinese, the translation of the word &quot;shi&quot; in this regard is generally as &quot;poem&quot;, &quot;song&quot;, or &quot;ode&quot;. Before its elevation as a canonical classic, the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; (&quot;Shi jing&quot;) was known as the &quot;Three Hundred Songs&quot; or the &quot;Songs&quot;.

== Content ==
The &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; contains the oldest chronologically authenticated Chinese poems. The majority of the &quot;Odes&quot; date to the Western Zhou period (1046–771 BCE), and were drawn from around provinces and cities in the Zhongyuan (Central Plains) area. A final section of 5 &quot;Eulogies of Shang&quot; purports to be ritual songs of the Shang dynasty as handed down by their descendants in the state of Song, but is generally considered quite late in date. According to the Eastern Han scholar Zheng Xuan, the latest material in the &quot;Shijing&quot; was the song &quot;Tree-Stump Grove&quot; () in the &quot;Odes of Chen&quot;, dated to the middle of the Spring and Autumn period ( 700 BCE).

The content of the &quot;Poetry&quot; can be divided into two main sections: the &quot;Airs of the States&quot;, and the &quot;Eulogies&quot; and &quot;Hymns&quot;.

The &quot;Airs of the States&quot; are shorter lyrics in simple language that are generally ancient folk songs which record the voice of the common people. They often speak of love and courtship, longing for an absent lover, soldiers on campaign, farming and housework, and political satire and protest. The first song of the &quot;Airs of the States&quot;, &quot;Fishhawk&quot; ( ), is a well-known example of the category. Confucius commented on it, and it was traditionally given special interpretive weight.

On the other hand, songs in the two &quot;Hymns&quot; sections and the &quot;Eulogies&quot; section tend to be longer ritual or sacrificial songs, usually in the forms of courtly panegyrics and dynastic hymns which praise the founders of the Zhou dynasty. They also include hymns used in sacrificial rites and songs used by the aristocracy in their sacrificial ceremonies or at banquets.

&quot;Court Hymns&quot; contains &quot;Lesser Court Hymns&quot; and &quot;Major Court Hymns&quot;. Most of the poems were used by the aristocrats to pray for good harvests each year, worship gods, and venerate their ancestors. The authors of &quot;Major Court Hymns&quot; are nobles who were dissatisfied with the political reality. Therefore, they wrote poems not only related to the feast, worship, and epic but also to reflect the public feelings.
== Style ==
Whether the various &quot;Shijing&quot; poems were folk songs or not, they &quot;all seem to have passed through the hands of men of letters at the royal Zhou court&quot;. In other words, they show an overall literary polish together with some general stylistic consistency. About 95% of lines in the &quot;Poetry&quot; are written in a four-syllable meter, with a slight caesura between the second and third syllables. Lines tend to occur in syntactically related couplets, with occasional parallelism, and longer poems are generally divided into similarly structured stanzas.

All but six of the &quot;Eulogies&quot; consist of a single stanza, and the &quot;Court Hymns&quot; exhibit wide variation in the number of stanzas and their lengths. Almost all of the &quot;Airs&quot;, however, consist of three stanzas, with four-line stanzas being most common. Although a few rhyming couplets occur, the standard pattern in such four-line stanzas required a rhyme between the second and fourth lines. Often the first or third lines would rhyme with these, or with each other. This style later became known as the &quot;shi&quot; style for much of Chinese history.

One of the characteristics of the poems in the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; is that they tend to possess &quot;elements of repetition and variation&quot;. This results in an &quot;alteration of similarities and differences in the formal structure: in successive stanzas, some lines and phrases are repeated verbatim, while others vary from stanza to stanza&quot;. Characteristically, the parallel or syntactically matched lines within a specific poem share the same, identical words (or characters) to a large degree, as opposed to confining the parallelism between lines to using grammatical category matching of the words in one line with the other word in the same position in the corresponding line; but, not by using the same, identical word(s). Disallowing verbal repetition within a poem would by the time of Tang poetry be one of the rules to distinguish the old style poetry from the new, regulated style.

The works in the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; vary in their lyrical qualities, which relates to the musical accompaniment with which they were in their early days performed. The songs from the &quot;Hymns&quot; and &quot;Eulogies&quot;, which are the oldest material in the &quot;Poetry&quot;, were performed to slow, heavy accompaniment from bells, drums, and stone chimes. However, these and the later actual musical scores or choreography which accompanied the &quot;Shijing&quot; poems have been lost.

Nearly all of the songs in the &quot;Poetry&quot; are rhyming, with end rhyme, as well as frequent internal rhyming. While some of these verses still rhyme in modern varieties of Chinese, others had ceased to rhyme by the Middle Chinese period. For example, the eighth song ( &quot;Fú Yǐ&quot;) has a tightly constrained structure implying rhymes between the penultimate words (here shown in bold) of each pair of lines:

The second and third stanzas still rhyme in modern Standard Chinese, with the rhyme words even having the same tone, but the first stanza does not rhyme in Middle Chinese or any modern variety. Such cases were attributed to lax rhyming practice until the late-Ming dynasty scholar Chen Di argued that the original rhymes had been obscured by sound change.
Since Chen, scholars have analyzed the rhyming patterns of the &quot;Poetry&quot; as crucial evidence for the reconstruction of Old Chinese phonology.

Traditional scholarship of the &quot;Poetry&quot; identified three major literary devices employed in the songs: straightforward narrative (&quot;fù&quot; ), explicit comparisons (&quot;bǐ&quot; ) and implied comparisons (&quot;xìng&quot; ). The poems of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; tend to have certain typical patterns in both rhyme and rhythm, to make much use of imagery, often derived from nature.

== Authorship ==
Although the &quot;Shijing&quot; does not specify the names of authors in association with the contained works, both traditional commentaries and modern scholarship have put forth hypotheses on authorship. The &quot;Golden Coffer&quot; chapter of the &quot;Book of Documents&quot; says that the poem &quot;Owl&quot; () in the &quot;Odes of Bin&quot; was written by the Duke of Zhou. Many of the songs appear to be folk songs and other compositions used in the court ceremonies of the aristocracy. Furthermore, many of the songs, based on internal evidence, appear to be written either by women, or from the perspective of a female persona. The repeated emphasis on female authorship of poetry in the &quot;Shijing&quot; was made much of in the process of attempting to give the poems of the women poets of the Ming-Qing period canonical status. Despite the impersonality of the poetic voice characteristic of the &quot;Songs&quot;, many of the poems are written from the perspective of various generic personalities.

== Textual history ==
According to tradition, the method of collection of the various &quot;Shijing&quot; poems involved the appointment of officials, whose duties included documenting verses current from the various states which constituted the empire. Out of these many collected pieces, also according to tradition, Confucius made a final editorial round of decisions for elimination or inclusion in the received version of the &quot;Poetry&quot;. As with all great literary works of ancient China, the &quot;Poetry&quot; has been annotated and commented on continuously throughout history, as well as in this case providing a model to inspire future poetic works.

Various traditions concern the gathering of the compiled songs and the editorial selection from these make up the classic text of the &quot;Odes&quot;: &quot;Royal Officials&#x27; Collecting Songs&quot; () is recorded in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, and &quot;Master Confucius Deletes Songs&quot; () refers to Confucius and his mention in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, where it says from originally some 3,000 songs and poems in a previously extant &quot;Odes&quot; that Confucius personally selected the &quot;300&quot; which he felt best conformed to traditional ritual propriety, thus producing the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;.

In 2015, the Anhui University purchased a group of looted manuscripts, among which is one of the oldest extant scribal copies of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; (at least part of it). The manuscript has been published in the first volume of this collection of manuscripts, ().

=== Compilation ===
The Confucian school eventually came to consider the verses of the &quot;Airs of the States&quot; to have been collected in the course of activities of officers dispatched by the Zhou dynasty court, whose duties included the field collection of the songs local to the territorial states of Zhou. This territory was roughly the Yellow River Plain, Shandong, southwestern Hebei, eastern Gansu, and the Han River region. Perhaps during the harvest. After the officials returned from their missions, the king was said to have observed them himself in an effort to understand the current condition of the common people. The well-being of the people was of special concern to the Zhou because of their ideological position that the right to rule was based on the benignity of the rulers to the people in accordance with the will of Heaven, and that this Heavenly Mandate would be withdrawn upon the failure of the ruling dynasty to ensure the prosperity of their subjects. The people&#x27;s folksongs were deemed to be the best gauge of their feelings and conditions, and thus indicative of whether the nobility was ruling according to the mandate of Heaven or not. Accordingly, the songs were collected from the various regions, converted from their diverse regional dialects into standard literary language, and presented accompanied with music at the royal courts.

=== Confucius ===
The &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; historically has a major place in the Four Books and Five Classics, the canonical works associated with Confucianism. Some pre-Qin dynasty texts, such as the &quot;Analects&quot; and a recently excavated manuscript from 300 BCE entitled &quot;Confucius&#x27; Discussion of the &quot;Odes&quot;&quot;, mention Confucius&#x27; involvement with the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; but Han dynasty historian Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; was the first work to directly attribute the work to Confucius. Subsequent Confucian tradition held that the &quot;Shijing&quot; collection was edited by Confucius from a larger 3,000-piece collection to its traditional 305-piece form. This claim is believed to reflect an early Chinese tendency to relate all of the Five Classics in some way or another to Confucius, who by the 1st century BCE had become the model of sages and was believed to have maintained a cultural connection to the early Zhou dynasty. This view is now generally discredited, as the &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot; records that the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; already existed in a definitive form when Confucius was just a young child.

In works attributed to him, Confucius comments upon the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; in such a way as to indicate that he holds it in great esteem. A story in the &quot;Analects&quot; recounts that Confucius&#x27; son Kong Li told the story: &quot;The Master once stood by himself, and I hurried to seek teaching from him. He asked me, &#x27;You&#x27;ve studied the Odes?&#x27; I answered, &#x27;Not yet.&#x27; He replied, &#x27;If you have not studied the Odes, then I have nothing to say.&#x27;&quot;

=== Han dynasty ===
According to Han tradition, the &quot;Poetry&quot; and other classics were targets of the burning of books in 213 BCE under Qin Shi Huang, and the songs had to be reconstructed largely from memory in the subsequent Han period. However the discovery of pre-Qin copies showing the same variation as Han texts, as well as evidence of Qin patronage of the &quot;Poetry&quot;, have led modern scholars to doubt this account.

During the Han period there were three different versions of the &quot;Poetry&quot; which each belonged to different hermeneutic traditions. The Lu &quot;Poetry&quot; ( &quot;Lǔ shī&quot;), the Qi &quot;Poetry&quot; ( &quot;Qí shī&quot;) and the Han &quot;Poetry&quot; ( &quot;Hán shī&quot;) were officially recognized with chairs at the Imperial Academy during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (156–87 BCE). Until the later years of the Eastern Han period, the dominant version of the &quot;Poetry&quot; was the Lu &quot;Poetry&quot;, named after the state of Lu, and founded by Shen Pei, a student of a disciple of the Warring States period philosopher Xunzi.

The Mao Tradition of the &quot;Poetry&quot; ( &quot;Máo shī zhuàn&quot;), attributed to an obscure scholar named Máo Hēng () who lived during the 2nd or 3rd centuries BCE, was not officially recognized until the reign of Emperor Ping (1 BCE to 6 CE). However, during the Eastern Han period, the Mao &quot;Poetry&quot; gradually became the primary version. Proponents of the Mao &quot;Poetry&quot; said that its text was descended from the first generation of Confucius&#x27; students, and as such should be the authoritative version. Xu Shen&#x27;s influential dictionary &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, written in the 2nd-century CE, quotes almost exclusively from the Mao &quot;Poetry&quot;. Finally, the renowned Eastern Han scholar Zheng Xuan used the Mao &quot;Poetry&quot; as the basis for his annotated 2nd-century edition of the &quot;Poetry&quot;. Zheng Xuan&#x27;s edition of the Mao text was itself the basis of the &quot;Right Meaning of the Mao &quot;Poetry&quot; ( &quot;) which became the imperially authorized text and commentary on the &quot;Poetry&quot; in 653 CE.

By the 5th-century, the Lu, Qi, and Han traditions had died out, leaving only the Mao &quot;Poetry&quot;, which has become the received text in use today.
Only isolated fragments of the Lu text survive, among the remains of the Xiping Stone Classics.

== Legacy ==

=== Confucian allegory ===
The &quot;Book of Odes&quot; has been a revered Confucian classic since the Han dynasty, and has been studied and memorized by centuries of scholars in China. The individual songs of the &quot;Odes&quot;, though frequently on simple, rustic subjects, have traditionally been saddled with extensive, elaborate allegorical meanings that assigned moral or political meaning to the smallest details of each line. The popular songs were seen as good keys to understanding the troubles of the common people, and were often read as allegories, and complaints against lovers were seen as complaints against faithless rulers. Confucius taught that the &quot;Odes&quot; were a valuable focus for knowledge and self-cultivation, as recorded in an anecdote in the &quot;Analects&quot;:
The extensive allegorical traditions associated with the &quot;Odes&quot; were theorized by Herbert Giles to have begun in the Warring States period as a justification for Confucius&#x27; focus upon such a seemingly simple and ordinary collection of verses. These elaborate, far-fetched interpretations seem to have gone completely unquestioned until the 12th century, when scholar Zheng Qiao (, 1104–1162) first wrote his scepticism of them. European sinologists like Giles and Marcel Granet ignored these traditional interpretations in their analysis of the original meanings of the &quot;Odes&quot;. Granet, in his list of rules for properly reading the &quot;Odes&quot;, wrote that readers should &quot;take no account of the standard interpretation&quot;, &quot;reject in no uncertain terms the distinction drawn between songs evicting a good state of morals and songs attesting to perverted morality&quot;, and &quot;[discard] all symbolic interpretations, and likewise any interpretation that supposes a refined technique on the part of the poets&quot;. These traditional allegories of politics and morality are no longer seriously followed by any modern readers in China or elsewhere.

=== Political influence ===
&quot;The Odes&quot; became an important and controversial force, influencing political, social and educational phenomena. During the struggle between Confucian, Legalist, and other schools of thought, the Confucians used the &quot;Shijing&quot; to bolster their viewpoint. On the Confucian side, the &quot;Shijing&quot; became a foundational text which informed and validated literature, education, and political affairs. The Legalists, on their side, attempted to suppress the &quot;Shijing&quot; by violence, after the Legalist philosophy was endorsed by the Qin dynasty, prior to their final triumph over the neighboring states: the suppression of Confucian and other thought and literature after the Qin victories and the start of Burning of Books and Burying of Scholars era, starting in 213 BCE, extended to attempt to prohibit the &quot;Shijing&quot;.

As the idea of allegorical expression grew, when kingdoms or feudal leaders wished to express or validate their own positions, they would sometimes couch the message within a poem, or by allusion. This practice became common among educated Chinese in their personal correspondences and spread to Japan and Korea as well.

=== Modern scholarship ===
Modern scholarship on the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot; often focuses on doing linguistic reconstruction and research in Old Chinese by analyzing the rhyme schemes in the &quot;Odes&quot;, which show vast differences when read in modern Mandarin Chinese. Although preserving more Old Chinese syllable endings than Mandarin, Modern Cantonese and Min Nan are also quite different from the Old Chinese language represented in the Odes.

C.H. Wang refers to the account of King Wu&#x27;s victory over the Shang dynasty in the &quot;Major Court Hymns&quot; as the &quot;Weniad&quot; (a name that parallels &quot;The Iliad&quot;), seeing it as part of a greater narrative discourse in China that extols the virtues of &quot;wén&quot; ( &quot;literature, culture&quot;) over more military interests.

<doc id="391379" wikidata="Q1358743" url="?curid=391379" title="Technōs Japan">
<text>was a Japanese video game developer, best known for the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; franchises (the latter including &quot;Renegade&quot;, &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot; and &quot;River City Ransom&quot;) as well as &quot;Karate Champ&quot;, &quot;The Combatribes&quot; and &quot;Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer&quot;. As of June 2015, Arc System Works owns the intellectual properties of Technōs Japan.

== History ==

Initially operating from a single-room apartment, Technōs was founded in 1981 by three staff members of Data East. Their first game was &quot;Minky Monkey&quot;, released in 1982. A few months after their foundation, a lawsuit was brought up against the company by Data East under allegations that Technos had stolen data from Data East&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Pro Tennis&quot; with the intent of producing and selling a bootleg of it. The two companies settled in August 1983 and Technos would go on to create two arcade games published by Data East, &quot;Tag Team Wrestling&quot; and &quot;Karate Champ&quot;. Technōs Japan&#x27;s earlier games were published by other companies, as Technōs at the time did not have the economical resource to distribute their own games.

&quot;Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun&quot; (&quot;Hot Blooded Tough Guy Kunio&quot;), a side-scrolling beat-em-up released in 1986 about a high school student who fought thugs and delinquents from other schools, was the company&#x27;s first big hit in Japan. &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; was released in the west as &quot;Renegade&quot; with the game&#x27;s graphics changed to make the game marketable in the overseas market. Technōs would then produce a Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game, which would be Technōs&#x27; first game for the home console market. Technōs Japan&#x27;s subsequent arcade beat-em-up, &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, was a big success worldwide when it was released in 1987, leading to the production of an NES version of the game, as well as licensed versions by other companies for various platforms.

The success of &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; led to the production of numerous spin-offs and sequels starring the same character produced for the 8-bit Family Computer platform in Japan and later for the Game Boy and Super Famicom, resulting in more than twenty games starring Kunio by the mid-1990s, many of which were rule-bending sports games. A few &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; games were localized for the North American market; namely &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;, &quot;River City Ransom&quot; and &quot;Nintendo World Cup&quot;, but none maintain any connection with each other. Technōs would attempt to remedy this by attempting to localize several &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; under the &quot;Crash &#x27;n the Boys&quot; label, but only &quot;Crash &#x27;n the Boys: Street Challenge&quot; was released (the game&#x27;s ending features a teaser for &quot;Ice Challenge&quot;, which was unreleased).

Technōs also released two arcade sequels to &quot;Double Dragon&quot;: &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot; in 1988 and &quot;Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone&quot; in 1990 (the latter was developed by an external development team at East Technology), and produced the respective NES versions of those games, as well as &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot; in 1992, an original installment for the Super NES. An American-produced &quot;Double Dragon&quot; animated series and a live-action film were also made as well.

Outside the &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; games, Technōs produced a few original games for the arcade and home markets such as &quot;U.S. Championship V&#x27;Ball&quot;, &quot;The Combatribes&quot; and &quot;Shadow Force&quot;, as well as two &quot;WWF&quot; arcade games (&quot;WWF Superstars&quot; and &quot;WWF Wrestlefest&quot;), but most of these games (aside from the WWF arcade games) did not achieve the same kind of success that &quot;Kunio-kun&quot; and &quot;Double Dragon&quot; achieved. The company&#x27;s last games were produced for the Neo Geo hardware, which include a &quot;Double Dragon&quot; fighting game based on the movie, their second and last fighting game &quot;Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer&quot;, and a Neo Geo sequel to &quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;. By 1996, Technōs Japan declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. Some of the developers who worked on the Neo Geo titles (including Kengo Asai) briefly worked at Face, a former affiliate of SNK.

===Post-bankruptcy===
Following the closure, a licensing company named Million Co., Ltd was formed to purchase the former intellectual properties of Technōs Japan. Million continued to produce new games such as &quot;Super Dodge Ball Advance&quot;, &quot;Double Dragon Advance&quot; and &quot;River City Ransom EX&quot; for the Game Boy Advance, &quot;Super Dodgeball Brawlers&quot; for the Nintendo DS, as well as reissuing older titles via the Virtual Console and other services. In June 2015, Arc System Works acquired all intellectual properties of Technōs Japan from Million Co., Ltd.

== U.S. subsidiary ==
Technōs Japan had a subsidiary in the U.S. called American Technōs Inc., which was originally located in Beaverton, Oregon until 28th of February 1991 then at Cupertino, California. American Technōs was formed in 1987, shortly after the release of &quot;Double Dragon&quot; at the arcades and published all of Technōs Japan&#x27;s arcade games in North America beginning with &quot;Double Dragon II: The Revenge&quot;. While the majority of Technōs Japan&#x27;s console games were still licensed to other companies such as Tradewest (&quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot;), Acclaim Entertainment (&quot;Double Dragon II&quot; and &quot;III&quot;), CSG Imagesoft (&quot;Super Dodge Ball&quot;) and even Nintendo (&quot;Super Spike V&#x27;Ball&quot; and &quot;Nintendo World Cup&quot;), American Technōs also managed to publish a few console games, namely &quot;River City Ransom&quot; and &quot;Crash &#x27;n the Boys: Street Challenge&quot; for the NES, &quot;Super Double Dragon&quot; (co-published with Tradewest) and &quot;The Combatribes&quot; for the Super NES, and &quot;Geom Cube&quot; for the PlayStation. American Technōs also published &quot;Super Bowling&quot; (developed by Athena) and &quot;Super Pinball: Behind the Mask&quot; (developed by Meldac/KAZe) for the Super NES and the helicopter game &quot;Strike Point&quot; for the PlayStation. American Technōs was still operating after Technōs Japan&#x27;s demise until sometime during the late 1990s. Its former president was Keiichi Iwamoto.

== List of games by platforms ==
All games are listed by original Japanese titles unless otherwise noted. Neo Geo games are listed separately from the other arcade games. This list does not take account licensed versions that were released by other companies (such as the Master System port of &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and the PC Engine ports of the Kunio games published by Naxat Soft) or games that were produced by Million, the subsequent copyrights holder of Technōs Japan&#x27;s former properties.

<doc id="391385" wikidata="Q7373311" url="?curid=391385" title="Roy Rogers Restaurants">
<text>Roy Rogers Franchise Company, LLC is a chain of fast food restaurants primarily located in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. The chain originated as the rebranding of the &quot;RoBee&#x27;s House of Beef&quot; chain of Fort Wayne, Indiana, acquired by the Marriott Corporation in February 1968. However, Marriott first used the Roy Rogers Roast Beef name on conversions of the company&#x27;s Junior Hot Shoppes in the Washington, D.C. area in April 1968, then the existing RoBee&#x27;s stores. An aggressive nationwide franchising campaign was launched. At its peak, the chain included over 600 locations. The chain now has 41 locations in five states, either company owned or franchised.

The Roy Rogers chain was sold in 1990 to Imasco, then the parent company of Hardee&#x27;s, and experienced severe decline as many locations converted to Hardee&#x27;s. In 2002, the trademark was purchased by Plamondon Companies.

Roy Rogers&#x27; menu consists primarily of hamburgers, roast beef sandwiches, fried chicken, nine side items (including french fries), and beverages. Many locations also serve breakfast.

==History==
===1967–1968: RoBee&#x27;s and Marriott===
In 1967, the Azar&#x27;s Big Boy restaurant franchise started RoBee&#x27;s House of Beef restaurants in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. The Marriott Corp., which had acquired Bob&#x27;s Big Boy and the Big Boy trademark in 1967, acquired RoBee&#x27;s in February 1968 with plans to expand nationwide. RoBee&#x27;s franchises would first be offered to Big Boy franchisees to coincide with their existing Big Boy territory. At the time there were 13 RoBee&#x27;s restaurants in six states.

During the acquisition, in January 1968, the competing roast beef chain Arby&#x27;s sued RoBee&#x27;s for trademark infringement and (other similarities that it considered) unfair competition. Because &quot;RoBee&#x27;s&quot; sounded too much like &quot;Arby&#x27;s&quot; the settlement required a new brand name and Marriott wanted something recognizable. Big Boy founder Bob Wian, then sitting on Marriott&#x27;s board of directors, was friends with Roy Rogers&#x27; agent and suggested that the company approach Rogers about the use of his name. Already interested in associating with a chain restaurant, Rogers was in similar discussions with another company when Marriott called. Nonetheless, he accepted Marriott&#x27;s offer: Rogers would receive a licensing fee for use of his name and also be paid for personal appearances at the restaurants. The restaurants would be called &quot;Roy Rogers Roast Beef Sandwich&quot; restaurants, and despite Arby&#x27;s complaints, it retained RoBee&#x27;s building design and covered wagon logo design.

Several major Big Boy franchisees accepted Marriott&#x27;s offer and became Roy Rogers regional franchisees, including Abdow&#x27;s, Frisch&#x27;s, Elias Brothers, Marc&#x27;s, and Shoney&#x27;s which together covered much of the Northeastern, Midwest and Southern US. Pittsburgh franchisee Eat&#x27;n Park rejected the offer and took public offense at paying fees to Rogers. In the Pittsburgh area and elsewhere, other regional franchisees were sought who would also subfranchise to smaller operators, and by January 1969, Marriott claimed regional franchises for every state but Alaska. Roy Rogers&#x27; restaurants also opened in Canada, franchised to that nation&#x27;s Big Boy franchisee, JB&#x27;s of Canada.

Marriott divided the United States into 33 franchise regions and required regional franchisees open a set number of restaurants in a four-year period. Regional franchisees would pay Marriott a 2% royalty, and subfranchisees typically pay the regional franchisee 3%, who would keep the additional 1%. A restaurant required a $35,000 cash investment upfront, including $7,500 paid to Marriott. Additionally, the cost of the building and equipment, with seating for 42 persons, cost about $100,000 in 1968, excluding the cost of land. Marriott offered financing but charged an interest rate of 12% on land and 17% for the building. The prototype restaurant seated 40 to 45 persons with additional outdoor seating on an optional patio in front of the building, but actual restaurants varied, one franchisee&#x27;s dining area accommodating 75 persons.

The first Roy Rogers restaurant opened up on Co- founder and Hot Shoppes manager, Henry L. Wright&#x27;s property in April 1968 in the Bailey&#x27;s Crossroads section of Falls Church, Virginia, on the corner of Leesburg Pike and Carlin Springs Road (5603 Leesburg Pike). Another opened at 5214 River Road, in Bethesda, Maryland. The area was selected because Marriott was headquartered in metropolitan Washington, D.C., with the River Road unit located directly across the street. (Marriott executives and Marriott family members were frequent patrons of this store.) These first locations were conversions of Jr. Hot Shoppes, Marriott&#x27;s existing fast food chain. In May 1968, RoBee&#x27;s units began to open as Roy Rogers. Rogers made a four-state tour of namesake restaurants in the Southern U.S., appearing at each location for an hour, shaking hands and handing out signed photographs. Filming for the first television commercials advertising Roy Rogers Restaurants took place in the Apple Valley, California, area where Rogers lived with his family. In 1968 and 1969, Rogers and friends, Earl Bascom and Mel Marion, were filmed at various locations including the historic Las Flores Ranch in Summit Valley and the Campbell Ranch in Victorville.

===1968–1989: Growth and challenges===

Rapid growth began in 1968 and Marriott made optimistic projections. In October 1968, there were reportedly 38 units open and 65 under construction, and by December, 56 opened with 39 under construction. Marriott projected 700 or more Roy Rogers restaurants in four years. By June 1969, 105 units were open with a new projection of 870 in four years. A February 1970 newspaper article reported that over 160 units were in operation. However, growth halted in 1970, when Marriott suspended Roy Rogers franchising, due to financial losses from closing failing locations. The following year, the Texas–based regional franchise, Ram-Hart Systems, filed for Chapter 11 protection, asking to terminate unprofitable leases, which made the entire chain unprofitable. After franchising resumed, only 172 restaurants were open by September 1972, a quarter of the 700 stores projected four years earlier.

In 1976, a Roy Rogers in Fairfax, Virginia, was robbed, where five employees were herded into the restaurant&#x27;s freezer and shot in the head. Only one survived.

On August 30, 1977, Roy Rogers was struck by a cottage cheese pie thrown by a 17 year old while Rogers and his Sons of the Pioneers singers were performing at a Fairfax restaurant. The youth pleaded guilty a month later and was fined $100.

In 1982, Marriott bought the Gino&#x27;s restaurant chain for $48.6 million. The company converted 180 of the 313 restaurants to Roy Rogers to expand in the Baltimore/Washington area.

Also in 1982, Marriott sued the Riese family, a franchisee, when they discovered the Rieses were planning to relocate a Roy Rogers restaurant with a Häagen Dazs and a Pizza Hut in Times Square. The Riese family won the suit, and the Riese Organization later developed other food courts in New York City.

===1990–1997: Hardee&#x27;s===
In 1990, Marriott sold the chain for $365 million to Imasco, the parent company of Hardee&#x27;s, a Midwestern and Southern chain seeking further expansion into the Mid-Atlantic market. The remaining non-franchised Roy Rogers locations were converted into Hardee&#x27;s restaurants, although many of the converted Hardee&#x27;s continued to offer Roy Rogers&#x27; fried chicken. This conversion caused a customer revolt and the units returned to the Roy Rogers&#x27; brand. The restaurants promoted new flame-broiled hamburgers, but they were not the same as the original Roy Rogers products and later failed.

Hardee&#x27;s finally sold the remaining Roy Rogers locations to McDonald&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, and Boston Market between 1994 and 1996. This left 13 Roy Rogers franchisees, with two dozen free-standing locations, in addition to locations owned by HMSHost in travel plazas along highways in the Northeast.

Prior to the Hardee&#x27;s acquisition, Roy Rogers cooked its fries in a blend of beef tallow and vegetable oil. Hardee&#x27;s, which had already replaced tallow with all vegetable shortening, implemented the same procedure for Roy Rogers.

===1997–present: CKE, Imasco, Plamondon Companies===
In 1997, CKE Restaurants acquired Hardee&#x27;s from Imasco, but Imasco retained the Roy Rogers trademark and franchise system. The Riese family, which owned 18 Roy Rogers restaurants, sued CKE Restaurants and Imasco for $10 million in 1997, claiming the Roy Rogers chain has been destroyed through &quot;a series of marketing errors of epic proportions.&quot;

Imasco sold Roy Rogers to Plamondon Enterprises (now Plamondon Companies) in 2002, after three years of negotiation. Roy Rogers was relaunched as Roy Rogers Franchise Company, LLC. Plamondon had already opened the first new Roy Rogers restaurant in Frederick, Maryland, in 2000. At the time of the sale, there were 63 existing Roy Rogers franchises in nine states.

In 2021, Roy Rogers announced a strategy to build concentrically out of core markets in the Mid-Atlantic, like Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The growth circle would slowly get bigger and include New York, the Eastern Seaboard, and states like Ohio, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia. The next year, the company announced a new partnership with One Holland Corporation restaurant group and planned to open 10 new Roy Rogers locations over the next six years in the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The new locations would be in Hamilton, Butler, and Clermont counties in Southwest Ohio; Boone, Kenton, and Campbell counties in Northern Kentucky; and Dearborn County in Southeast Indiana. Despite these plans, a spokesperson for One Holland Corp. says that none will be opened after the Cleves, Ohio, location, failed their expectations and closed in September 2024 after opening in February of the previous year.

In 2025, Roy Rogers will open a third location in Leesburg, Virginia, where it has already has a strong presence as well as one in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

==Products and services==
Though standard Roy Rogers locations serve food in a typical fast-food fashion, some locations (such as the locations that were formerly Jr. Hot Shoppes) and the franchises located throughout Mid-Atlantic highway rest-stops serve the food in a cafeteria-style. An exception is the Allentown service plaza on the Pennsylvania Turnpike&#x27;s Northeast Extension, which serves its customers in the typical fast-food fashion since it reopened in May 2008 (the entire service plaza had been rebuilt from its original form, which included cafeteria-style serving).

In the cafeteria-style restaurants, customers push their trays on rails past stations stocked with pre-wrapped packages of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and roast-beef sandwiches. A feature of this chain in any of the locations is the Fixin&#x27;s Bar which features numerous condiments. Due to this feature, sandwich items are delivered without any of the customary garnishes. After selecting and paying for these items, patrons can garnish them to their own taste at the Fixin&#x27;s Bar with such items as ketchup, BBQ sauce, mayonnaise, horseradish sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and onions. Numerous locations offer hand-dipped milkshakes made with Edy&#x27;s Ice Cream.

Popular items on the menu are roast beef sandwiches and fried chicken, which was advertised by Roy Rogers under the &quot;Pappy Parker&quot; name beginning in the 1970s using a cartoon prospector (the Pappy Parker name was inherited from Marriott&#x27;s original Hot Shoppes chain). Other signature items at Roy Rogers are the Gold Rush chicken sandwich (a fried chicken breast with bacon, a slice of Monterey Jack cheese, and a honey-based BBQ sauce) and the Double-R Bar Burger (a cheeseburger with ham). The side items featured at Roy Rogers are french fries, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes with gravy, and baked beans. Seasonal items that select Roy Rogers locations occasionally offer include the beer-battered cod sandwich and platter.

<doc id="391388" wikidata="Q626023" url="?curid=391388" title="Northern elephant seal">
<text>The northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) is one of two species of elephant seal (the other is the southern elephant seal). It is a member of the family Phocidae (true seals). Elephant seals derive their name from their great size and from the male&#x27;s large proboscis, which is used in making extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating competition. Sexual dimorphism in size is great. Correspondingly, the mating system is highly polygynous; a successful male is able to impregnate up to 50 females in one season.

==Description==

The huge male northern elephant seal typically weighs and measures , although some males can weigh up to . Females are much smaller and can range from in weight, or roughly a third of the male&#x27;s bulk, and measure from . The bull southern elephant seals are, on average, larger than those in the northern species, but the females in both are around the same size, indicating the even higher level of sexual dimorphism in the southern species. Northern elephant seals typically live for around nine years.

Pups are born with dark, almost black fur that they shed after weaning to turn silvery grey. As they develop, both juveniles and adults go through a molting period in which their initially black fur is replaced with a coat that ranges from silver to deep grey, finally fading to tan. Adult males&#x27; necks and chests are furless and have a speckled pattern of pink, white, and light brown. This the consequence of thicker, calloused skin that builds a protective shield in preparation for fights they participate in during the mating season. 

The eyes are large, round, and black. The width of the eyes and a high concentration of low-light pigments suggest sight plays an important role in the capture of prey. Like all seals, elephant seals have atrophied hind limbs whose underdeveloped ends form the tail and tail fin. Each of the &quot;feet&quot; can deploy five long, webbed fingers. This agile, dual palm is used to propel water. The pectoral fins are used little while swimming.
While their hind limbs are unfit for locomotion on land, elephant seals use their fins as support to propel their bodies. They are able to propel themselves quickly — as fast as — in this way for short-distance travel, to return to water, catch up with a female or chase an intruder.

Like other seals, elephant seals&#x27; bloodstreams are adapted to the cold in which a mixture of small veins surrounds arteries capturing heat from them. This structure is present in extremities such as the hindlimbs.

A unique characteristic of the northern elephant seal is that it has developed the ability to store oxygenated red blood cells within its spleen. In a 2004 study researchers used MRI to observe physiological changes of the spleens of five seal pups during simulated dives. By three minutes, the spleens on average contracted to a fifth of their original size, indicating a dive-related sympathetic contraction of the spleen. Also, a delay was observed between contraction of the spleen and increased hematocrit within the circulating blood, and attributed to the hepatic sinus. This fluid-filled structure is initially expanded due to the rush of RBC from the spleen and slowly releases the red blood cells into the circulatory system via a muscular vena caval sphincter found on the cranial aspect of the diaphragm. This ability to slowly introduce RBC into the blood stream is likely to prevent any harmful effects caused by a rapid increase in hematocrit.

==Range and ecology==
The northern elephant seal lives in the eastern Pacific Ocean. They spend most of their time at sea, and usually only come to land to give birth, breed, and molt. These activities occur at rookeries that are located on offshore islands or remote mainland beaches. The majority of these rookeries are in California and northern Baja California, ranging from Point Reyes National Seashore, California to Isla Natividad, Mexico. Significant breeding colonies exist at Channel Islands, Año Nuevo State Reserve, Piedras Blancas Light, Morro Bay State Park and the Farallon Islands in the US, and Isla Guadalupe, Isla Benito del Este and Isla Cedros in Mexico. In recent decades the breeding range has extended northwards. In 1976 the first pup was found on Point Reyes and a breeding colony established there in 1981. Since the mid-1990s some breeding has been observed at Castle Rock in Northern California and Shell Island off Oregon, and in January 2009 the first elephant seal births were recorded in British Columbia at Race Rocks. The California breeding population is now demographically isolated from the population in Baja California.

Northern elephant seals exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism in their feeding behaviours. When the males leave their rookeries, they migrate northwards to their feeding grounds along the continental shelf from Washington to the western Aleutians in Alaska. The males mostly feed on benthic organisms on the ocean floor. When the females leave their rookeries, they head north or west into open ocean, and forage across a large area in the northeastern Pacific. They have been recorded as far west as Hawaii. Female elephant seals feed mainly on pelagic organisms in the water column.

Vagrant elephant seals possibly appear on tropical regions such as at Mariana Islands. Historical occurrences of elephant seal presence, residential or occasional, in western North Pacific are fairly unknown. There have been two records of vagrants visiting to Japanese coasts; a male on Niijima in 1989 and a young seal on beaches in Hasama, Tateyama in 2001. A female was found on Sanze beach, Tsuruoka, Yamagata in October 2017, making it the first record from Sea of Japan. This individual was severely weakened but showing signs of recovery after receiving medications at Kamo Aquarium, and the aquarium is discussing whether or not to release her.
Some individuals have been observed on the coast of northeast Asia. Certain individuals established haul-out sites at the Commander Islands in the early 2000s; however, due to aggressive interactions with local Steller sea lions, long-term colonization is not expected.

Female elephant seals forage in the open ocean, while male elephant seals forage along the continental shelf. Males usually dive straight down to the ocean floor and stay at the bottom foraging for benthic prey. The females hunt for pelagic prey in the open ocean, and dive deeper — up to , though on average about — and stay down longer than the males. Female elephant seals have been tagged and found to dive almost continuously for 20 hours or more a day, mostly in deep water, where small fish are abundant.

Northern elephant seals eat a variety of prey, including mesopelagic fish such as myctophids, deep-water squid, Pacific hake, pelagic crustaceans, relatively small sharks, rays, and ratfish. &quot;Octopoteuthis deletron&quot; squid are a common prey item, one study found this species in the stomachs of 58% of individuals sampled off the coast of California. A female northern elephant seal was documented in 2013 by a deep sea camera at a depth of , where she consumed a Pacific hagfish, slurping it up from the ocean floor. The event was reported by a Ukrainian boy named Kirill Dudko, who further reported the find to scientists in Canada. Elephant seals do not need to drink, as they get their water from food and metabolism of fats.

While hunting in the dark depths, elephant seals seem to locate their prey at least partly by vision; the bioluminescence of some prey animals can facilitate their capture. Elephant seals do not have a developed a system of echolocation in the manner of cetaceans, but their vibrissae, which are sensitive to vibrations, are assumed to play a role in search of food. Males and females differ in diving behavior. Males tend to hug the continental shelf while making deep dives and forage along the bottom, while females have more jagged routes and forage in the open ocean. Elephant seals are prey for orcas and great white sharks. Both are most likely to hunt pups, and seldom hunt large bull elephant seals, but have taken seals of all ages. The shark, when hunting adults, is most likely to ambush a seal with a damaging bite and wait until it is weakened by blood loss to finish the kill.

==Social behavior and reproduction==
Northern elephant seals return to their terrestrial breeding ground in December and January, with the bulls arriving first. The bulls haul out on isolated or otherwise protected beaches, typically on islands or very remote mainland locations. It is important that these beach areas offer protection from the winter storms and high surf wave action. The bulls engage in fights of supremacy to determine which few bulls will achieve a harem.

After the males have arrived on the beach, the females arrive to give birth. Females fast for five weeks and nurse their single pup for four weeks; in the last few days of lactation, females come into estrus and mate. Mating behavior relates to a social hierarchy, and stronger males are considered higher rank than those smaller and weaker. In this polygynous society, a high-ranking bull can have a harem of 30–100 cows, depending on his size and strength. Males unable to establish harems will wait on the periphery, and will try to mount nearby females. Dominant bulls will disrupt copulations of lower-ranking bulls. They can mount females without interference, but commonly break off to chase off rivals. While fights are not usually to the death, they are brutal and often with significant bloodshed and injury; however, in many cases of mismatched opponents, the younger, less capable males are simply chased away, often to upland dunes. In a lifetime, a successful bull could easily sire over 500 pups. Most copulations in a breeding colony are done by only a small number of males and the rest may never be able to mate with a female. Copulation is most often on land, and takes roughly five minutes. Pups are sometimes crushed during battles between bulls.
After arrival on shore, males fast for three months, and females fast for five weeks during mating and when nursing their pups. The gestation period is about 11 months. One study observed the vast majority of births to take place at night, and in the aforementioned harems. Immediately after birth, a female will turn to her pup and emit a warbling vocalization to attract them, and will continue to throughout the nursing period. Sometimes, a female can become very aggressive after giving birth and will defend her pup from other females. Such aggression is more common in crowded beaches. While most females nurse their own pups and reject nursings from alien pups, some do accept alien pups with their own. An orphaned pup may try to find another female to suckle and some are adopted, at least on Año Nuevo Island. Some pups, known as super weaners, may grow to exceptionally large sizes by nursing from other females in addition to their mothers. Pups nurse about four weeks and are weaned abruptly before being abandoned by their mother, who heads out to sea within a few days. Pups gain weight rapidly during the nursing period, and weigh on average upon being weaned. Left alone, weaned pups will gather into groups and stay on shore for 12 more weeks. The pups learn how to swim in the surf and eventually swim farther to forage. Thus, their first long journey at sea begins.

Elephant seals communicate though various means. Males will threaten each other with the snort, a sound caused by expelling air though their probosces, and the clap-trap, a loud, clapping sound comparable to the sound of a diesel engine. Pups will vocalize when stressed or when prodding their mothers to allow them to suckle. Females make an unpulsed attraction call when responding to their young, and a harsh, pulsed call when threatened by other females, males or alien pups. Elephant seals produce low-frequency sounds, both substrate-borne and air-borne. These sounds help maintain social hierarchy in crowded or noisy environments and reduce energy consumption when fasting.

==History and status==

Beginning in the 18th century, northern elephant seals were hunted extensively, almost to extinction by the end of the 19th century, being prized for oil made from their blubber, and the population may have fallen as low as only 20–40 individuals. In 1874, Charles Melville Scammon recorded in &quot;Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast of America&quot;, that an long bull caught on Santa Barbara Island yielded of oil. They were thought to be extinct in 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, who promptly killed several for their collections. The elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922. Since the early 20th century, they have been protected by law in both Mexico and in the United States. Subsequently, the U.S. protection was strengthened after passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and numbers have now recovered to over 200,000.

Nevertheless, a genetic bottleneck experienced by northern elephant seals during the nineteenth century made them more susceptible to disease, environmental changes and pollution. Such a small initial population of around 20–40 also meant that extensive inbreeding occurred within the species, leading to a whole other onset of issues. Such issues from the bottleneck a sharp loss of genetic diversity and increased homozygosity in the surviving population, and also a decreased number of haplogroups. In addition to this, there was also a substantial increase in the rate of asymmetry within the animals&#x27; skulls.

In California, the population is continuing to grow at around 6% per year, and new colonies are being established; they are now probably limited mostly by the availability of haul-out space. Their breeding was probably restricted to islands, before large carnivores were exterminated or prevented from reaching the side of the ocean. Numbers can be adversely affected by El Niño events and the resultant weather conditions, and the 1997–98 El Niño may have caused the loss of about 80% of that year&#x27;s pups. Presently, the northern elephant seal is protected under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and has a fully protected status under California law (California Fish and Game Code [FGC] § 4700).

While the population is rising in the state of California, some colonies farther south are experiencing declining populations, likely due to rising sea and air temperatures. In Baja California, the two largest colonies, in Guadalupe and San Benito, have seen consistently declining numbers for the past two decades. Seeing as populations farther north are consistently increasing, it has been hypothesized that this discrepancy is due to a change in migration patterns. As sea and air temperatures rise, Northern elephant seals may not be migrating as far south as they have previously. The climate is expected to continue warming, and southern populations are expected to continue falling.

Populations of rookery sites in California have increased during the past century. At Año Nuevo State Park, for example, no individuals were observed whatsoever until 1955; the first pup born there was observed in the early 1960s. Currently, thousands of pups are born every year at Año Nuevo, on both the island and mainland. The growth of the site near San Simeon has proved even more spectacular; no animals were there prior to 1990. Currently, the San Simeon site hosts more breeding animals than Año Nuevo State Park during winter season.

<text>The Benevolence International Foundation (BIF; Benevolence International Fund in Canada), was a purported nonprofit charitable trust based in Saudi Arabia. It was determined to be a front for terrorist group Al-Qaeda and was banned by the United Nations Security Council Committee 1267 and the US Department of the Treasury in November 2002. The BIF&#x27;s chief executive officer Enaam Arnaout began a ten-year sentence in 2003 after pleading guilty for racketeering in a U.S. federal court.

The nonprofit was founded in 1987 by Adel bin Abdul-Jalil Batterjee of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Batterjee was later personally embargoed by the UN from December 2004 until March 2013 and by the US, from December 2004 on. Their website stated that they were a &quot;humanitarian organization helping those afflicted by wars&quot; and providing &quot;short-term relief such as emergency food distribution, long term projects, education and self-sufficiency to the children, widowed, refugees, injured and staff of vital governmental institutions.&quot; The BIF had offices in Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo and Zenica), Canada, China, Croatia, Georgia (Duisi and Tbilisi), the Netherlands, Pakistan (Islamabad, Peshawar), the Palestinian Territories, Russia (Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Moscow), Saudi Arabia (Riyadh and Jeddah), Sudan, Tajikistan, the United Kingdom, the United States and Yemen.

A list of the 20 main financiers of Al-Qaeda, composed by Osama bin Laden in 1988 and dubbed by him the Golden Chain, was found in the Bosnia office of Benevolence International Foundation when it was raided in March 2002.

== History ==
The Islamic Benevolence Committee (&quot;Lajnat al-Birr al-Islamiah&quot;) was founded in 1987 by Adel bin Abdul-Jalil Batterjee () of Jeddah Saudi Arabia and had operations in both Jeddah and Peshawar, Pakistan. The group was a &quot;charity&quot; that openly supported fighters against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, supplying weapons and funds to the Mujaheddin and facilitating the immigration of foreign volunteer jihadists into that conflict zone.

Another organization, the Benevolence International Corporation, is said to have been started in 1988 by Mohammed Jamal Khalifa of Jeddah, the brother in law of Osama Bin Laden. At the time of founding and operation, it was known as an &quot;import-export&quot; company. It is said that this group was a front for the Abu Sayyaf group.

In 1992 the Benevolence International Corporation (BIC) in the Philippines folded public operations, while the Islamic Benevolence Committee was renamed to the Benevolence International Foundation (BIF). The new entity was incorporated as a tax-exempt nonprofit in Illinois on March 30, 1992, with Enaam Arnaout as its director. Arnaout married an American woman and obtained citizenship in the United States. In 1993 the organization&#x27;s headquarters moved to Chicago. Meanwhile, the Filipino BIC group would become a group set up to attack U.S. interests in the Philippines. Khalid Sheik Mohammed is said to have led the rest of the group.

On June 15, 1994, US Ambassador Melissa F. Wells visited the BIF headquarters on an envoy from President Bill Clinton, met with Ma&#x27;moun Muhammad al-Hasan Bilou, and &quot;praised BIF and its efforts to provide humanitarian relief&quot;.

In late 1994, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa travelled to the United States to meet with Mohamed Loay Bayazid, the president of BIC at the time.

== Prosecution ==
Khalifa and Bayazid were arrested in Mountain View, California, in December 1994. The FBI received communications from the Philippines that Khalifa was funding Operation Bojinka, a terrorist plot that was foiled on January 6, 1995. However, Khalifa was deported to Jordan by the INS in May 1995. The Jordanian court acquitted Khalifa and until his death, he lived in Saudi Arabia. Bayazid was also let go.

The U.S. Government alleged that the group sent money and communications to Osama Bin Laden and purchased rockets, mortars, rifles, bayonets, dynamite and other bombs for Al-Qaeda members in Chechnya, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and redirected funds meant for charity purposes to purposes related to terrorism. The U.S. government also alleged that the group was aiding the travel of terrorists, including Khalifa, Bayazid, and al-Qaeda co-founder Mamdouh Salim. In addition, it was also coordinating the escape of BIF members from Bosnian police.

During a sentencing hearing in August 2003, U.S. District Judge Suzanne Conlon told prosecutors they had &quot;failed to connect the dots&quot; and said there was no evidence that Arnaout &quot;identified with or supported&quot; terrorism.

These allegations were withdrawn as part of a February 2003 plea bargain in which Enaam Arnaout pleaded guilty to racketeering charges. The plea bargain allowed for him to provide information to prosecutors as long as charges that are related to Al-Qaeda are dropped. He publicly denies any link to the group.

A 2011 NPR report claimed that some of the people associated with this group were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication Management Unit.

<doc id="391399" wikidata="Q4119678" url="?curid=391399" title="Music of Mauritania">
<text>The music of [[Mauritania]] comes predominantly from the country&#x27;s largest ethnic group: the Moors. In Moorish society musicians occupy the lowest caste, iggawin. Musicians from this caste used song to praise successful warriors as well as their patrons. Iggawin also had the traditional role of messengers, spreading news between villages. In modern Mauritania, professional musicians are paid by anybody to perform; affluent patrons sometimes record the entertainment, rather than the musicians themselves, and are then considered to own the recording.

==Instruments==
Traditional instruments include an hourglass-shaped four-stringed lute called the tidinit and the woman&#x27;s kora-like ardin. Percussion instruments include the tbal (a kettle drum) and daghumma (a rattle).

==Types of Mauritanian music==
There are three &quot;ways&quot; to play music in the Mauritanian tradition:
*Al-bayda - the white way, associated with delicate and refined music, and the Bidan (Moors of North African stock)
*Al-kahla - the black way, associated with roots and masculine music, and the Haratin (Moors of Sub-Saharan stock)
*l&#x27;-gnaydiya - the mixed or &quot;spotted&quot; way

Music progresses through five modes (a system with origins in Arabic music): &quot;karr&quot;, &quot;fagu&quot; (both black), &quot;lakhal&quot;, &quot;labyad&quot; (both white, and corresponding to a period of one&#x27;s life or an emotion) and &quot;lebtyat&quot; (white, a spiritual mode relating to the afterlife). There are further submodes, making for a complicated system, one to which nearly all male musicians conform. Female musicians are rare and are not bound by the same set of rules.

==Musicians==
In spite of the rarity of female musicians in Mauritania, the most famous Moorish musician is a woman, Dimi Mint Abba. Dimi&#x27;s parents were both musicians (her father had been asked to compose the Mauritanian national anthem), and she began playing at an early age. Her professional career began in 1976, when she sang on the radio and then competed, the following year, in the Umm Kulthum Contest in Tunis.

Another popular female musician is Malouma, who is also a respected politician and social activist (&quot;Desert of Eden,&quot; Shanachie Records [U.S.], 1998).

Another esteemed female musician is Noura Mint Seymali.

Mauritania has also rappers in the Hip-hop movement. Professional Hip-hop started in the late 2000s.

<doc id="391415" wikidata="Q181816" url="?curid=391415" title="George Formby">
<text>George Formby, (born George Hoy Booth; 26 May 1904 – 6 March 1961), was an English actor, singer-songwriter and comedian who became known to a worldwide audience through his films of the 1930s and 1940s. On stage, screen and record he sang light, comic songs, usually playing the ukulele or banjolele, and became the UK&#x27;s highest-paid entertainer.

Born in Wigan, Lancashire, he was the son of George Formby Sr, from whom he later took his stage name. After an early career as a stable boy and jockey, Formby took to the music hall stage after the early death of his father in 1921. His early performances were taken exclusively from his father&#x27;s act, including the same songs, jokes and characters. In 1923 he made two career-changing decisions – he purchased a ukulele, and married Beryl Ingham, a fellow performer who became his manager and transformed his act. She insisted that he appear on stage formally dressed, and introduced the ukulele to his performance. He started his recording career in 1926 and, from 1934, he increasingly worked in film to develop into a major star by the late 1930s and 1940s, and became the UK&#x27;s most popular entertainer during those decades. The film historian Brian McFarlane writes that on film, Formby portrayed gormless Lancastrian innocents who would win through against some form of villainy, gaining the affection of an attractive middle-class girl in the process.

During the Second World War Formby worked extensively for the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), and entertained civilians and troops, and by 1946 it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel. After the war his career declined, although he toured the Commonwealth, and continued to appear in variety and pantomime. His last television appearance was in December 1960, two weeks before the death of Beryl. He surprised people by announcing his engagement to a school teacher, Pat Howson, seven weeks after Beryl&#x27;s funeral, but died in Preston three weeks later, at the age of 56; he was buried in Warrington, alongside his father.

Formby&#x27;s biographer, Jeffrey Richards, considers that the actor &quot;had been able to embody simultaneously Lancashire, the working classes, the people, and the nation&quot;. Formby was considered Britain&#x27;s first properly home-grown screen comedian. He was an influence on future comedians—particularly Charlie Drake and Norman Wisdom—and, culturally, on entertainers such as the Beatles, who referred to him in their music. Since his death, Formby has been the subject of numerous biographies, television specials and two works of public sculpture.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1904–1921===

George Formby was born George Hoy Booth in Wigan, Lancashire, on 26 May 1904. He was the eldest of seven surviving children born to James Lawler Booth and his wife Eliza, Hoy, although this marriage was bigamous because Booth was still married to his first wife, Martha Maria Salter, a twenty-year-old music hall performer. Booth was a successful music hall comedian and singer who performed under the name George Formby (he is now known as George Formby Sr). Formby Sr suffered from a chest ailment, identified variously as bronchitis, asthma or tuberculosis, and would use the cough as part of the humour in his act, saying to the audience, &quot;Bronchitis, I&#x27;m a bit tight tonight&quot;, or &quot;coughing better tonight&quot;. One of his main characters was that of John Willie, an &quot;archetypal Lancashire lad&quot;. In 1906 Formby Sr was earning £35 a week at the music halls, which rose to £325 a week by 1920, and Formby grew up in an affluent home. Formby Sr was so popular that Marie Lloyd, the influential music hall singer and actress, would only watch two acts: his and that of Dan Leno.
Formby was born blind owing to an obstructive caul, although his sight was restored during a violent coughing fit or sneeze when he was a few months old. After briefly attending school—at which he did not prosper, and did not learn to read or write—Formby was removed from formal education at the age of seven and sent to become a stable boy, briefly in Wiltshire and then in Middleham, Yorkshire. Formby Sr sent his son away to work as he was worried Formby would watch him on stage; he was against Formby following in his footsteps, saying &quot;one fool in the family is enough&quot;. After a year working at Middleham, he was apprenticed to Thomas Scholfield at Epsom, where he ran his first professional races at the age of 10, when he weighed less than .

In 1915 Formby Sr allowed his son to appear on screen, taking the lead in &quot;By the Shortest of Heads&quot;, a thriller directed by Bert Haldane in which Formby played a stable boy who outwits a gang of villains and wins a £10,000 prize when he comes first in a horse race. The film is now considered lost, with the last-known copy having been destroyed in 1940. Later in 1915, and with the closure of the English racing season because of the First World War, Formby moved to Ireland where he continued as a jockey until November 1918. Later that month he returned to England and raced for Lord Derby at his Newmarket stables. Formby continued as a jockey until 1921, although he never won a race.

===Beginning a stage career: 1921–1934===

On 8 February 1921 Formby Sr succumbed to his bronchial condition and died, at the age of 45; he was buried in the Catholic section of Warrington Cemetery. After his father&#x27;s funeral Eliza took the young Formby to London to help him cope with his grief. While there, they visited the Victoria Palace Theatre—where Formby Sr had previously been so successful—and saw a performance by the Tyneside comedian Tommy Dixon. Dixon was performing a copy of Formby Sr&#x27;s act, using the same songs, jokes, costumes and mannerisms, and billed himself as &quot;The New George Formby&quot;, a name which angered Eliza and Formby even more. The performance prompted Formby to follow in his father&#x27;s profession, a decision which was supported by Eliza. As he had never seen his father perform live, Formby found the imitation difficult and had to learn his father&#x27;s songs from records, and the rest of his act and jokes from his mother.

On 21 March 1921 Formby gave his first professional appearance in a two-week run at the Hippodrome in Earlestown, Lancashire, where he received a fee of £5 a week. In the show he was billed as George Hoy, using his mother&#x27;s maiden name—he explained later that he did not want the Formby name to appear in small print. His father&#x27;s name was used in the posters and advertising, George Hoy being described as &quot;Comedian. (son of George Formby)&quot;. While still appearing in Earlestown Formby was hired to appear at the Moss Empire chain of theatres for £17 10s a week. His first night was unsuccessful and he later said of it, &quot;I was the first turn, three minutes, died the death of a dog&quot;. He toured around venues in Northern England, although he was not well received, and was booed and hissed while performing in Blyth, Northumberland. As a result he experienced frequent periods of unemployment—up to three months at one point. Formby spent two years as a support act touring round the northern halls, and although he was poorly paid, his mother supported him financially.

In 1923 Formby started to play the ukulele, although the exact circumstances of how he came to play the instrument are unknown, and he introduced it into his act during a run at the Alhambra Theatre in Barnsley. When the songs—still his father&#x27;s material—were well received, he changed his stage name to George Formby, and stopped using the John Willie character. Another significant event was his appearance in Castleford, West Yorkshire, where appearing on the same bill was Beryl Ingham, an Accrington-born champion clogdancer and actress who had won the All England Step Dancing title at the age of 11. Beryl, who had formed a dancing act with her sister, May, called &quot;The Two Violets&quot;, had a low opinion of Formby&#x27;s act, and later said that &quot;if I&#x27;d had a bag of rotten tomatoes with me I&#x27;d have thrown them at him&quot;. Formby and Beryl entered into a relationship and married two years later, on 13 September 1924, at a register office in Wigan, with Formby&#x27;s aunt and uncle as witnesses. Upon hearing the news, Eliza insisted on the couple having a church wedding, which followed two months later.
Beryl took over as George&#x27;s manager, and changed aspects of his act, including the songs and jokes. She instructed him on how to use his hands, and how to work his audience. She also persuaded him to change his stage dress to black tie—although he appeared in a range of other costumes too—and to take lessons in how to play the ukulele properly. By June 1926 he was proficient enough to earn a one-off record deal—negotiated by Beryl—to sing six of his father&#x27;s songs for the Edison Bell/Winner label. Formby spent the next few years touring, largely in the north, but also appearing at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, his official London debut. Although he had a further recording session in October 1929, performing two songs for Dominion Records, &quot;Beryl&#x27;s avaricious demands would prevent any serious contract from coming George&#x27;s way&quot;, according to David Bret, Formby&#x27;s biographer. That changed in 1932, when Formby signed a three-year deal with Decca Records. One of the songs he recorded in July was &quot;Chinese Laundry Blues&quot;, telling the story of Mr Wu, which became one of his standard songs, and part of a long-running series of songs about the character. Over the course of his career Formby went on to record over 200 songs, around 90 of which were written by Fred Cliffe and Harry Gifford. In the 1932 winter season Formby appeared in his first pantomime, &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;, in Bolton, after which he toured with the &quot;George Formby Road Show&quot; around the north of England, with Beryl acting as the commère; the show also toured in 1934.

===Burgeoning film career: 1934–1940===
With Formby&#x27;s growing success on stage, Beryl decided it was time for him to move into films. In 1934 she approached the producer Basil Dean, the head of Associated Talking Pictures (ATP). Although he expressed an interest in Formby, he did not like the associated demands from Beryl. She also met the representative of Warner Bros. in the UK, Irving Asher, who was dismissive, saying that Formby was &quot;too stupid to play the bad guy and too ugly to play the hero&quot;. Three weeks later Formby was approached by John E. Blakeley of Blakeley&#x27;s Productions, who offered him a one-film deal.

The film, &quot;Boots! Boots!&quot;, was shot on a budget of £3,000 in a one-room studio in Albany Street, London. Formby played the John Willie character, while Beryl also appeared, and the couple were paid £100 for the two weeks&#x27; work, plus 10 per cent of the profits. The film followed a revue format, and Jo Botting, writing for the British Film Institute, describes it as having a &quot;wafer-thin plot&quot; that is &quot;almost incidental&quot;. Botting also considers the film has &quot;poor sound quality, static scene set-ups and [a] lack of sets&quot;, and while it did not impress the critics, audience figures were high. Formby followed this up with &quot;Off the Dole&quot; in 1935, again for Blakeley, who had re-named his company Mancunian Films. The film cost £3,000 to make, and earned £80,000 at the box office. As with &quot;Boots! Boots!&quot;, the film was in a revue format, and Formby again played John Willie, with Beryl as his co-star. According to Formby&#x27;s biographer, Jeffrey Richards, the two films for Blakeley &quot;are an invaluable record of the pre-cinematic Formby at work&quot;.

The success of the pictures led Dean to offer Formby a seven-year contract with ATP, which resulted in the production of 11 films, although Dean&#x27;s fellow producer, Michael Balcon, considered Formby to be &quot;an odd and not particularly loveable character&quot;. The first film from the deal was released in 1935. &quot;No Limit&quot; features Formby as an entrant in the Isle of Man annual Tourist Trophy (TT) motorcycle race. Monty Banks directed, and Florence Desmond took the female lead. According to Richards, Dean did not try &quot;to play down Formby&#x27;s Lancashire character&quot; for the film, and employed Walter Greenwood, the Salford-born author of the 1933 novel &quot;Love on the Dole&quot;, as the scriptwriter. Filming was troubled, with Beryl being difficult to everyone present. The writer Matthew Sweet describes the set as &quot;a battleground&quot; because of her actions, and Banks unsuccessfully requested that Dean bar Beryl from the studio. &quot;The Observer&quot; thought that parts of &quot;No Limit&quot; were &quot;pretty dull stuff&quot;, but the race footage was &quot;shot and cut to a maximum of excitement&quot;. Regarding the star of the film, the reviewer thought that &quot;our Lancashire George is a grand lad; he can gag and clown, play the banjo and sing with authority ... Still and all, he doesn&#x27;t do too bad.&quot; The film was so popular it was reissued in 1938, 1946 and 1957.

The formula used for &quot;No Limit&quot; was repeated in his following works: Formby played &quot;the urban &#x27;little man&#x27; defeated—but refusing to admit it&quot;. He portrayed a good-natured, but accident-prone and incompetent Lancastrian, who was often in a skilled trade, or the services. The plots were geared to Formby trying to achieve success in a field unfamiliar to him (in horse racing, the TT Races, as a spy or a policeman), and by winning the affections of a middle-class girl in the process. Interspersed throughout each film is a series of songs by Formby, in which he plays the banjo, banjolele or ukulele. The films are, in the words of the film historian Brian McFarlane, &quot;unpretentiously skilful in their balance between broad comedy and action, laced with ... [Formby&#x27;s] shy ordinariness&quot;.

&quot;No Limit&quot; was followed by &quot;Keep Your Seats, Please&quot; in 1936, which was again directed by Banks with Desmond returning as the co-star. Tensions arose in pre-production with Banks and some of the cast requesting to Dean that Beryl be banned from the set. Tempers had also become strained between Formby and Desmond, who were not on speaking terms except to film scenes. The situation became so bad that Dean avoided visiting his studios for the month of filming. The film contained the song &quot;The Window Cleaner&quot; (popularly known as &quot;When I&#x27;m Cleaning Windows&quot;), which was soon banned by the BBC. The corporation&#x27;s director John Reith stated that &quot;if the public wants to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, they&#x27;ll have to be content to hear it in the cinemas, not over the nation&#x27;s airwaves&quot;; Formby and Beryl were furious with the block on the song. In May 1941 Beryl informed the BBC that the song was a favourite of the royal family, particularly Queen Mary, while a statement by Formby pointed out that &quot;I sang it before the King and Queen at the Royal Variety Performance&quot;. The BBC relented and started to broadcast the song.

When production finished on &quot;Keep Your Seats, Please&quot;, Beryl insisted that for the next film there should be &quot;no Eye-Ties and stuck-up little trollops involved&quot;, referring to Banks and Desmond, respectively. Dean had tired of the on-set squabbles, and for the third ATP film, &quot;Feather Your Nest&quot;, he appointed William Beaudine as the director, and Polly Ward, the niece of the music hall star Marie Lloyd, as the female lead. Bret describes the songs in the film as &quot;comparatively bland&quot;, but &quot;with the exception of the one which would become immortal&quot;: &quot;Leaning on a Lamp-post&quot;.

By the time of the next production, &quot;Keep Fit&quot; in 1937, Dean had begun to assemble a special team at Ealing Studios to help develop and produce the Formby films; key among the members were the director Anthony Kimmins, who went on to direct five of Formby&#x27;s films. Kay Walsh was cast as the leading lady and, in the absences of Beryl from the set, Formby and Walsh had an affair, after she fell for his &quot;flirtatious behaviour off-camera&quot;. Although Beryl was furious with Walsh, and tried to have her removed from the film, a showdown with Dean proved fruitless. Dean informed her that Walsh was to remain the lead in both &quot;Keep Fit&quot;, and in Formby&#x27;s next film (&quot;I See Ice&quot;, 1938); to mollify her Dean raised Formby&#x27;s fee for the latter film to £25,000.

When filming concluded on &quot;I See Ice&quot;, Formby spent the 1937 summer season performing in the revue &quot;King Cheer&quot; at the Opera House Theatre, Blackpool, before appearing in a 12-minute slot in the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium that November. The popularity of his performances meant that in 1937 he was the top British male star in box office takings, a position he held every subsequent year until 1943. Additionally, between 1938 and 1942 he was also the highest-paid entertainer in Britain, and by the end of the 1930s was earning £100,000 a year.
In early 1938 Dean informed the Formbys that in the next film, &quot;It&#x27;s in the Air&quot;, Banks would return to direct and Walsh would again be the leading lady. Beryl objected strongly, and Kimmins continued his directorial duties, while Ward was brought in for the female lead. Beryl, as she did with all Formby&#x27;s female co-stars, &quot;read the &#x27;keep-your-hands-off-my-husband&#x27; riot act&quot; to the actress. In May, while filming &quot;It&#x27;s in the Air&quot;, Formby purchased a Rolls-Royce, with the personalised number plate GF 1. Every year afterwards he would purchase either a new Rolls-Royce or Bentley, buying 26 over the course of his life.

In the autumn of 1938 Formby began work on &quot;Trouble Brewing&quot;, released the following year with 19-year-old Googie Withers as the female lead; Kimmins again directed. Withers later recounted that Formby did not speak to her until, during a break in filming when Beryl was not present, he whispered out of the corner of his mouth &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, love, but you know, I&#x27;m not allowed to speak to you&quot;, something she thought was &quot;very sweet&quot;. His second release of 1939—shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War—was &quot;Come On George!&quot;, which cast Pat Kirkwood in the female lead; the pair disliked each other intensely, and neither of the Formbys liked several of the other senior cast members. &quot;Come On George!&quot; was screened for troops serving in France before being released in Britain.

===Second World War: service with ENSA===

At the outbreak of the Second World War Dean left ATP and became the head of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), the organisation that provided entertainment to the British Armed Forces. Over the course of five months Formby requested to sign up for ENSA, but was denied; Dean relented in February 1940, and Formby was signed on a fixed salary of £10 per week, although he still remained under contract to ATP. He undertook his first tour in France in March, where he performed for members of the British Expeditionary Force.

The social research organisation Mass-Observation recorded that Formby&#x27;s first film of 1940, &quot;Let George Do It!&quot;, gave a particularly strong boost to early-war British civilian morale. In a dream sequence after being drugged, Formby&#x27;s character ropes into a Nuremberg Rally and punches Hitler. According to Richards, the scene provided &quot;the visual encapsulation of the people&#x27;s war with the English Everyman flooring the Nazi Superman&quot;. The scene was so striking that the film became Formby&#x27;s first international release, in the US, under the title &quot;To Hell With Hitler&quot;, and in Moscow—where it was released in 1943 under the title &quot;Dinky Doo&quot;—it was shown to packed houses and received record box-office takings for over ten months. The critics also praised the film, and the &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; called it Formby&#x27;s &quot;best performance to date&quot;, and the film, &quot;a box office certainty&quot;.

Formby&#x27;s ENSA commitments were heavy, touring factories, theatres and concert halls around Britain. He also gave free concerts for charities and worthy causes, and raised £10,000 for the Fleetwood Fund on behalf of the families of missing trawlermen. He and Beryl also set up their own charities, such as the OK Club for Kids, whose aim was to provide cigarettes for Yorkshire soldiers, and the Jump Fund, to provide home-knitted balaclavas, scarves and socks to servicemen. Formby also joined the Home Guard as a dispatch rider, where he took his duties seriously, and fitted them around his other work whenever he could.

Formby continued filming with ATP, and his second film of 1940, &quot;Spare a Copper&quot;, was again focused on an aspect of the war, this time combating fifth columnists and saboteurs in a Merseyside dockyard. Cinema-goers had begun to tire of war films, and his next venture, &quot;Turned Out Nice Again&quot; returned to less contentious issues, with Formby&#x27;s character caught in a domestic battle between his new wife and mother. Early in the filming schedule, he took time to perform in an ENSA show that was broadcast on the BBC from Aldwych tube station as &quot;Let the People Sing&quot;; he sang four songs, and told the audience, &quot;Don&#x27;t forget, it&#x27;s wonderful to be British!&quot; Towards the end of 1940 Formby tried to enlist for active military service, despite Beryl informing him that by being a member of ENSA he was already signed up. The examining board rejected him as being unfit, because he had sinusitis and arthritic toes. He spent the winter season in pantomime at the Opera House Theatre, Blackpool, portraying Idle Jack in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot;. When the season came to an end the Formbys moved to London and, in May 1941, performed for the royal family at Windsor Castle. He had commissioned a new set of inoffensive lyrics for &quot;When I&#x27;m Cleaning Windows&quot;, but was informed that he should sing the original, uncensored version, which was enjoyed by the royal party, particularly Queen Mary, who asked for a repeat of the song. King George VI presented Formby with a set of gold cuff links, and advised him to &quot;wear them, not put them away&quot;.

With the ATP contract at an end, Formby decided not to renew or push for an extension. Robert Murphy, in his study of wartime British cinema, points out that Balcon, Formby&#x27;s producer at the time, &quot;seems to have made little effort to persuade him not to transfer his allegiance&quot;, despite the box office success enjoyed by &quot;Let George Do It&quot; and &quot;Spare a Copper&quot;. Numerous offers came in, and Formby selected the American company Columbia Pictures, in a deal worth in excess of £500,000 to make a minimum of six films—seven were eventually made. Formby set up his own company, Hillcrest Productions, to distribute the films, and had the final decision on the choice of director, scriptwriter and theme, while Columbia would have the choice of leading lady. Part of Formby&#x27;s reasoning behind the decision was a desire for parts with more character, something that would not have happened at ATP.

At the end of August 1941 production began on Formby&#x27;s first film for Columbia, &quot;South American George&quot;, which took six weeks to complete. Formby&#x27;s move to an American company was controversial, and although his popular appeal seemed unaffected, his &quot;films were treated with increasing critical hostility&quot;, according to John Mundy in his 2007 examination of British musical film. The reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that the story was &quot;confused&quot; and considered that &quot;there is not sufficient comic invention in the telling&quot; of it. Murphy writes that the criticism &quot;had more to do with the inadequate vehicles which he subsequently appeared in than in any diminution of his personal popularity.&quot;
In early 1942 Formby undertook a three-week, 72-show tour of Northern Ireland, largely playing to troops but also undertaking fund-raising shows for charity—one at the Belfast Hippodrome raised £500. He described his time in Ulster as &quot;the pleasantest tour I&#x27;ve ever undertaken&quot;. He returned to the mainland by way of the Isle of Man, where he entertained the troops guarding the internment camps. After further charity shows—raising £8,000 for a tank fund—Formby was the associate producer for the Vera Lynn film &quot;We&#x27;ll Meet Again&quot; (1943). In March he also filmed &quot;Much Too Shy&quot; which was released in October that year. Although the film was poorly received by the critics, the public still attended in large numbers, and the film was profitable.

In the summer of 1942 Formby was involved in a controversy with the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society, who had filed law suits against the BBC for playing secular music on Sunday. The society began a campaign against the entertainment industry, claiming all theatrical activity on a Sunday was unethical, and cited a 1667 law which made it illegal. With 60 leading entertainers already avoiding Sunday working, Dean informed Formby that his stance would be crucial in avoiding a spread of the problem. Formby issued a statement, &quot;I&#x27;ll hang up my uke on Sundays only when our lads stop fighting and getting killed on Sundays ... as far as the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society are concerned, they can mind their own bloody business. And in any case, what have &quot;they&quot; done for the war effort except get on everyone&#x27;s nerves?&quot; The following day it was announced that the pressure from the society was to be lifted.

At the end of the year Formby started filming &quot;Get Cracking&quot;, a story about the Home Guard, which was completed in under a month, the tight schedule brought about by an impending ENSA tour of the Mediterranean. Between the end of filming &quot;Get Cracking&quot; and the release of the film in May 1943, Formby undertook a tour of Northern Scotland and the Orkney Islands, and had nearly completed shooting on his next film, &quot;Bell-Bottom George&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; opined that &quot;&quot;Get Cracking&quot;, although a distinct improvement on other films in which Mr Formby has appeared, is cut too closely to fit the demands of an individual technique to achieve any real life of its own&quot;.

&quot;Bell-Bottom George&quot; was described 60 years later by the academic Baz Kershaw as being &quot;unashamedly gay and ... peppered with homoerotic scenes&quot;; Bret concurs, and notes that &quot;the majority of the cast and almost every one of the male extras was unashamedly gay&quot;, The film was a hit with what Bret describes as Formby&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly large, closeted gay following&quot;. The reviewer for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; was impressed with the film, and wrote that &quot;there is a new neatness of execution and lightness of touch about this production ... while George himself can no longer be accused of trailing clouds of vaudevillian glory&quot;. The reviewer also considered Formby &quot;our first authentic and strictly indigenous film comedian&quot;. After completing filming, the Formbys undertook a further ENSA tour. Although Dean personally disliked the Formbys, he greatly admired the tireless work they did for the organisation. In August Formby undertook a 53-day tour in a significant portion of the Mediterranean, including Italy, Sicily, Malta, Gibraltar, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine; visiting 750,000 troops in thirteen countries, touring in the process and returning to England in October. The couple travelled around the countryside in a Ford Mercury that Formby had purchased from the racing driver Sir Malcolm Campbell, which had been converted to sleep two in the back.
In January 1944 Formby described his experiences touring for ENSA in Europe and the Middle East in a BBC radio broadcast. He said that the troops &quot;were worrying quite a lot about you folks at home, but we soon put them right about that. We told them that after four and a half years, Britain was still the best country to live in&quot;. Shortly after he began filming &quot;He Snoops to Conquer&quot;—his fifth picture for Columbia—he was visited on set by the Dance Music Policy Committee (DMPC), an organisation responsible for vetting music for broadcast, which had also been given responsibility for checking if music was sympathetic towards the enemy during the war. The DMPC interviewed Formby about three songs that had been included in &quot;Bell-Bottom George&quot;: &quot;Swim Little Fish&quot;, &quot;If I Had a Girl Like You&quot; and &quot;Bell-Bottom George&quot;. Formby was summoned to the BBC&#x27;s offices to perform his three songs in front of the committee, with his song checked against the available sheet music. A week later, on 1 February, the committee met and decided the songs were innocuous, although Formby was told that he would have to get further clearance if the lyrics were changed. Bret opines that he had been the victim of a plot by a member of the Variety Artists&#x27; Federation, following Formby&#x27;s scathing comments on entertainers who were too scared to leave London to entertain the troops. The comments, which appeared in the forces magazine &quot;Union Jack&quot;, were then widely reported in the press in Britain. The Variety Artists&#x27; Federation demanded that Formby release names, and threatened him with action if he did not do so, but he refused to give in to their pressure.

Formby went to Normandy in July 1944 in the vanguard of a wave of ENSA performers. He and Beryl travelled over on a rough crossing to Arromanches giving a series of impromptu concerts to troops in improvised conditions, including on the backs of farm carts and army lorries, or in bomb-cratered fields. In one location the German front line was too close for him to perform, so he crawled into the trenches and told jokes with the troops there. He then boarded HMS &quot;Ambitious&quot; for his first scheduled concert before returning to France to continue his tour. During dinner with General Bernard Montgomery, whom he had met in North Africa, Formby was invited to visit the glider crews of 6th Airborne Division, who had been holding a series of bridges without relief for 56 days. He did so on 17 August in a one-day visit to the front line bridges, where he gave nine shows, all standing beside a sandbag wall, ready to jump into a slit trench in case of problems; much of the time his audience were in foxholes. After the four-week tour of France, Formby returned home to start work on &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Do It&quot; (released in 1945), although he continued to work on ENSA concerts and tours in Britain. Between January and March 1945, shortly after the release of &quot;He Snoops to Conquer&quot;, he left on an ENSA tour that took in Burma, India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The concerts in the Far East were his last for ENSA, and by the end of the war it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel.

===Post-war career: 1946–1952===
In 1946 the song &quot;With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock&quot;, which Formby had recorded in 1937, began to cause problems at the BBC for broadcasts of Formby or his music. The producer of one of Formby&#x27;s live television programmes received a letter from a BBC manager that stated &quot;We have no record that &quot;With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock&quot; is banned. We do however know and so does Formby, that certain lines in the lyric must not be broadcast&quot;. Other sources, including the BBC, state that the song was banned from being broadcast. Between July and October 1946 Formby filmed &quot;George in Civvy Street&quot;, which would be his final film. The story concerns the rivalry between two pubs: the Unicorn, bequeathed to Formby&#x27;s character, and the Lion, owned by his childhood sweetheart—played by Rosalyn Boulter—but run by an unscrupulous manager. Richards considers the film to have &quot;symbolic significance&quot;; at the end, with the marriage between the two pub owners, Formby &quot;bowed out of films unifying the nation mythically, communally and matrimonially&quot;.

The film was less successful at the box office than his previous works, as audience tastes had changed in the post-war world. Fisher opines that because of his tireless war work, Formby had become too synonymous with the war, causing the public to turn away from him, much as they had from the wartime British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Bret believes that post-war audiences wanted intrigue, suspense and romance, through the films of James Mason, Stewart Granger, David Niven and Laurence Olivier. Bret also indicates that Formby&#x27;s cinematic decline was shared by similar performers, including Gracie Fields, Tommy Trinder and Will Hay. Formby&#x27;s biographers, Alan Randall and Ray Seaton, opine that in his late 40s, Formby &quot;was greying and thickening out&quot;, and was too old to play the innocent young Lancashire lad. The slump in his screen popularity hit Formby hard, and he became depressed. In early 1946 Beryl checked him into a psychiatric hospital under her maiden name, Ingham. He came out after five weeks, in time for a tour of Scandinavia in May.

On his return from Scandinavia Formby went into pantomime in Blackpool; while there, he learned of his appointment as Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1946 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours. Although delighted, he was upset that Beryl went without official recognition, and said &quot;if somethin&#x27; was comin&#x27; our way, ah&#x27;d like it to be somethin&#x27; Beryl could have shared&quot;. Later that year the Formbys toured South Africa shortly before formal racial apartheid was introduced. While there they refused to play racially-segregated venues. When Formby was cheered by a black audience after embracing a small black girl who had presented his wife with a box of chocolates, National Party leader Daniel François Malan (who later introduced apartheid) telephoned to complain; Beryl replied &quot;Why don&#x27;t you piss off, you horrible little man?&quot;

Formby returned to Britain at Christmas and appeared in &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; at the Grand Theatre, Leeds for nine weeks, and then, in February 1947, he appeared in variety for two weeks at the London Palladium. Reviewing the show, &quot;The Times&quot; thought Formby was &quot;more than ever the mechanized perfection of naive jollity. His smile, though fixed, is winning, and his songs ... are catchy&quot;. In September that year he went on a 12-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. On his return he was offered more film roles, but turned them down, saying &quot;when I look back on some of the films I&#x27;ve done in the past it makes me want to cringe. I&#x27;m afraid the days of being a clown are gone. From now on I&#x27;m only going to do variety&quot;. He began suffering increasing health problems including a gastric ulcer, and was treated for breathing problems from his heavy smoking. He finished the year in pantomime, appearing as Buttons in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, with Beryl playing Dandini.

In September 1949 Formby went on a 19 city coast-to-coast Canadian tour, from which he returned unwell. While subsequently appearing in &quot;Cinderella&quot; in Leeds, he collapsed in his dressing room. The attending doctor administered morphine, to which Formby briefly became addicted. Further poor health plagued him into 1950, with a bout of dysentery, followed by appendicitis, after which he recuperated in Norfolk, before giving another royal command performance that April. He undertook two further international tours that year: one to Scandinavia, and a second to Canada. His earnings of Ca$200,000 were heavily taxed: Canadian taxes took up $68,000, and UK taxes took 90% of the balance. Formby complained to reporters about the level of taxation, saying &quot;That&#x27;s it. So long as the government keeps bleeding me dry, I shan&#x27;t be in much of a hurry to work again!&quot;; he and Beryl spent the rest of the year resting in Norfolk, in temporary retirement.

Formby was tempted back to work by the theatrical impresario Emile Littler, who offered him the lead role of Percy Piggott in &quot;Zip Goes a Million&quot;, a play based on the 1902 novel &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot; by G. B. McCutcheon; Formby was offered £1,500, plus a share of the box-office takings. The show premiered at the Coventry Hippodrome in September 1951 before opening at the Palace Theatre, London on 20 October. &quot;The Times&quot; commented unfavourably, saying that although the audience were appreciative of the play, they &quot;could not conceivably have detected a spark of wit in either the lyrics or the dialogue&quot;; the paper was equally dismissive of Formby, writing that &quot;he has a deft way with a song or a banjo, but little or no finesse in his handling of a comic situation&quot;.

A month after the play opened in London, Formby was the guest star on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, where one of his choices was his father&#x27;s &quot;Standing on the Corner of the Street&quot;. In early 1952 Formby&#x27;s health began to decline and, on 28 April, he decided to withdraw from &quot;Zip Goes a Million&quot;. On the way to the theatre to inform Littler, Formby suffered a heart attack, although it took the doctors five days to diagnose the coronary and admit him to hospital. He was treated for both the attack, and his morphine addiction. He stayed in hospital for nine weeks before returning home to Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, where he announced his retirement.

===Health problems and intermittent work: 1952–1960===

During his recuperation Formby contracted gastroenteritis and had a suspected blood clot on his lung, after which he underwent an operation to clear a fishbone that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Garrick Theatre, Southport. That September he turned on the Blackpool Illuminations.

From October to December 1953 Formby appeared at the London Palladium in 138 performances of the revue &quot;Fun and the Fair&quot;, with Terry-Thomas and the Billy Cotton band; Formby appeared in the penultimate act of the evening, with Terry-Thomas closing the show. Although Formby&#x27;s act was well-received, the show was not as successful as had been hoped, and Terry-Thomas later wrote that &quot;Formby put the audience in a certain mood which made them non-receptive to whoever followed ... Even though my act was the star spot, I felt on this occasion that my being there was an anti-climax&quot;. He requested that the order be changed to have Formby close the show, but this was turned down. Formby suffered from stage fright during the show&#x27;s run—the first time he had suffered from the condition since his earliest days on stage—and his bouts of depression returned, along with stomach problems.

Formby took a break from work until mid-1954, when he starred in the revue &quot;Turned Out Nice Again&quot;, in Blackpool. Although the show was initially scheduled to run for 13 weeks, it was cut short after six when Formby suffered again from dysentery and depression. He again announced his retirement, but continued to work. After some television appearances on &quot;Ask Pickles&quot; and &quot;Top of the Town&quot;, in late 1954 and early 1955 respectively, Formby travelled to South Africa for a tour, where Beryl negotiated an agreement with the South African premier Johannes Strijdom to play in venues of Formby&#x27;s choice, and then sailed to Canada for a ten-day series of performances. On the return voyage he contracted bronchial pneumonia, but still joined the cast of the non-musical play &quot;Too Young to Marry&quot; on his arrival in Britain.

In August 1955 Beryl felt unwell and went for tests: she was diagnosed with cancer of the uterus and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to the news in different ways, and while Beryl began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began to work harder, and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.

&quot;Too Young to Marry&quot; toured between September 1955 and November 1956, but still allowed Formby time to appear in the Christmas pantomime &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; at the Liverpool Empire Theatre. The touring production was well received everywhere except in Scotland, where Formby&#x27;s attempted Scottish accent is thought to have put people off. For Christmas 1956 he appeared in his first London pantomime, playing Idle Jack in &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot; at the Palace Theatre, although he withdrew from the run in early February after suffering from laryngitis. According to Bret, Formby spent the remainder of 1957 &quot;doing virtually nothing&quot;, although he appeared in two television programmes, &quot;Val Parnell&#x27;s Saturday Spectacular&quot; in July and &quot;Top of the Bill&quot; in October.

From March 1958 Formby appeared in the musical comedy &quot;Beside the Seaside&quot;, a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play may not have been to southern audiences&#x27; tastes—the plot centres on a northern family&#x27;s holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to &quot;Beside the Seaside&quot;, he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in &quot;Val Parnell&#x27;s Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat&quot; in January, and in April hosted his own show, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out With Formby&quot;. During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, Great Yarmouth, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, partly as a result of his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.

Formby&#x27;s final year of work was 1960. That May he recorded his last session of songs, &quot;Happy Go Lucky Me&quot; and &quot;Banjo Boy&quot;, the former of which peaked at number 40 in the UK Singles Chart. He then spent the summer season at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in Blackpool in &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;—a performance which was also broadcast by the BBC. One of the acts in the show was the singer Yana, with whom Formby had an affair, made easier because of Beryl&#x27;s absence from the theatre through illness. His final televised performance, a 35-minute BBC programme, &quot;The Friday Show: George Formby&quot;, was aired on 16 December. Bret considers the programme to be Formby&#x27;s &quot;greatest performance—it was certainly his most sincere&quot;, although reviewing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Mary Crozier thought it &quot;too slow&quot;. She went on to say &quot;George Formby is really a music-hall star, and it needs the warmth and sociability of the theatre to bring out his full appeal&quot;. Beryl&#x27;s illness was worsening. Worn down by the strain, and feeling the need to escape, Formby took the part of Mr Wu in &quot;Aladdin&quot; in Bristol, having turned down a more lucrative part in Blackpool.

===Final months: a new romance, death and family dispute===
Two hours before the premiere of &quot;Aladdin&quot;—on Christmas Eve 1960—Formby received a phone call from Beryl&#x27;s doctor, saying that she was in a coma and was not expected to survive the night; Formby went through with the performance, and was told early the next morning that Beryl had died. Her cremation took place on 27 December, and an hour after the service Formby returned to Bristol to appear in that day&#x27;s matinee performance of &quot;Aladdin&quot;. He continued in the show until 14 January when a cold forced him to rest, on doctors&#x27; advice. He returned to Lytham St Annes and communicated with Pat Howson; she contacted his doctor and Formby was instructed to go to hospital, where he remained for the next two weeks.

On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1961, seven weeks after Beryl&#x27;s death, Formby and Howson announced their engagement. Eight days later he suffered a heart attack which was so severe that he was given the last rites of the Catholic Church on his arrival at hospital in Preston. He was revived and, from his hospital bed, he and Howson planned their wedding, which was due to take place in May. He was still there when, on 6 March, he had a further heart attack and died at the age of 56. The obituarist for &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that &quot;he was the amateur of the old smoking concert platform turned into a music-hall professional of genius&quot;, while Donald Zec, writing in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, called him &quot;as great an entertainer as any of the giants of the music-hall&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered that &quot;with his ukulele, his songs, and his grinning patter, the sum was greater than any of those parts: a Lancashire character&quot;, while in the eyes of the public, Formby&#x27;s &quot;passing was genuinely and widely mourned&quot;.

Formby was buried alongside his father in Warrington Cemetery with over 150,000 mourners lining the route. The undertaker was Bruce Williams who, as Eddie Latta, had written songs for Formby. An hour after the ceremony the family read the will, which had been drawn up two weeks previously. Harry Scott—Formby&#x27;s valet and —was to receive £5,000, while the rest was to go to Howson; at probate Formby&#x27;s estate was valued at £135,000. Formby&#x27;s mother and siblings were angered by the will, and contested it. In the words of Bret &quot;mourning ... [Formby] was marred by a greedy family squabbling over his not inconsiderable fortune&quot;.

Because the will was contested, Formby&#x27;s solicitor insisted that a public auction was held for the contents of Formby&#x27;s house, which took place over three days in June. Howson offered to honour an earlier will by providing £5,000 for Eliza and £2,000 each for Formby&#x27;s sisters, but the offer was rejected, and the matter went to the High Court in London. The case was heard in May 1963 before Mr Justice Ormrod. At the end, Eliza was granted £5,000, and the sisters received £2,000 each. Formby&#x27;s solicitor, John Crowther, acted for Howson, and explained that the bequest to Formby&#x27;s sisters from the older will was made &quot;with reluctance&quot; by Formby, who had described his family as &quot;a set of scroungers&quot;. The family appealed the decision and the matter lasted until September 1965, when it was finally dismissed in Howson&#x27;s favour.

==Screen persona and technique==
Richards considers that Formby &quot;had been able to embody simultaneously Lancashire, the working classes, the people, and the nation&quot;; Geoff King, in his examination of film comedy, also sees Formby as an icon, and writes that &quot;[Gracie] Fields and Formby gained the status of national as well as regional figures, without sacrificing their distinctive regional personality traits&quot;. While the national aspect was important for success outside the north, &quot;the Lancashire accent remained to enhance his homely comic appeal&quot;. McFarlane writes that, on film, Formby portrayed &quot;essentially gormless incompetents, aspiring to various kinds of professional success ... and even more improbably to a middle-class girlfriend, usually in the clutches of some caddish type with a moustache. Invariably he scored on both counts&quot;.

On an edition of ITV&#x27;s &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; in November 1992, Richards commented that Formby &quot;embodied qualities that people admired and found reassuring in the depression ... and you thought that here&#x27;s a man whom whatever is thrown at him, will come through and come out smiling—and people wanted that&quot;. H.J. Igoe, writing in &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot;, thinks that &quot;Formby has a common English touch. We warm to the kindly turnip face, the revolving eyes, the mouth like a slashed coconut, the silly little songs ... the melodiously tinny voice and twanging banjo. The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother&#x27;s boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot hang a picture and underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious&quot;.
Richards identifies in Formby &quot;an innocence that was essentially childlike ... which explains why George was as popular with children as he was with adults&quot;; Igoe agrees, and writes that &quot;we know he loves children, because himself he is a child&quot;. Formby&#x27;s screen and stage persona of innocence and simplicity was not seen as ignorance or stupidity, although Basil Dean disagreed and thought that Formby &quot;didn&#x27;t act gormless as many successful Lancashire comedians have done, he was gormless&quot;. Much of the innocence in Formby&#x27;s performance is connected to sex, and the use of double entendres within his songs. John Caughie and Kevin Rockett, in their examination of British film, and Richards, see a connection between Formby&#x27;s approach to sex and the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill. Richards sees the function of Formby&#x27;s humour as being the same as McGill&#x27;s: &quot;the harmless diffusion of a major source of tension in a deeply repressed and conventional society&quot;. Formby&#x27;s delivery of the sexual content—what McFarlane identifies as being &quot;sung with such a toothy grin and air of innocence&quot;—negated any possible indignation, and this contrasts with the more overtly sexual delivery of other performers of the time, such as Max Miller and Frank Randle.

The ukulele expert Steven Sproat considers that Formby &quot;was incredible ... There hasn&#x27;t really been a uke player since Formby—or even before Formby—who played quite like him&quot;. Much of Formby&#x27;s virtuosity came from his right-hand technique, the split stroke, and he developed his own fast and complicated syncopated musical style with a very fast right-hand strum. Joe Cooper, writing in &quot;New Society&quot;, considered that &quot;Nobody has ever reproduced the casual devastating right hand syncopation, which so delicately synchronised with deft left hand chord fingering&quot;.

==Legacy==

Formby&#x27;s screen persona influenced Norman Wisdom in the 1950s and Charlie Drake in the following decade, although both these performers used pathos, which Formby avoided.

Shortly after Formby&#x27;s death a small group of fans formed the George Formby Society, which had its inaugural meeting at the Imperial Hotel Blackpool. George Harrison was a fan of Formby, a member of the Society and an advocate of the ukulele. The rest of the Beatles were also fans—they improvised with ukuleles during the recording breaks on &quot;Let It Be&quot;—and Formby&#x27;s influence can be heard in the song &quot;Her Majesty&quot;. The Beatles&#x27; penultimate song, &quot;Free as a Bird&quot;, ends with a slight coda including a strummed ukulele by Harrison and the voice of John Lennon played backwards, saying &quot;Turned out nice again&quot;.

As of 2014 there are two public statues of Formby. The first, by the Manx artist Amanda Barton, is in Douglas, Isle of Man, and shows him leaning on a lamp-post and dressed in the motorcycle leathers of a TT racer. Barton was also commissioned to provide a second statue for the Lancashire town of Wigan, which was unveiled in September 2007 in the town&#x27;s Grand Arcade shopping centre.

Formby has been the subject of five biographies as of 2014. In the late 1960s Harry Scott published his reminiscences of Formby, &quot;The Fabulous Formby&quot;, in 14 issues of &quot;The Vellum&quot;, the magazine of the George Formby Society; John Fisher published &quot;George Formby&quot; in 1975 before Alan Randall and Ray Seaton published their book in 1974 and David Bret produced &quot;George Formby: A Troubled Genius&quot; in 1999. The last of the five to be published was by Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard in 2011, &quot;It&#x27;s Turned Out Nice Again!&quot;. There have also been two documentaries on British television, an edition of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; in 1992, and &quot;Frank Skinner on George Formby&quot; in 2011.

In 2004 Formby was inducted into the Ukulele Hall of Fame, a non-profit organisation for the preservation of ukulele history. His citation reads, in part: &quot;He won such love and respect for his charismatic stage presence, technical skill and playful lyrics that he remains popular forty years after his death.&quot; In June 2012 a Blackpool Boat Car tram, number 604, was repainted and returned to service with sponsorship from the George Formby Society. The tram was named &quot;George Formby OBE&quot; and images of him are affixed within the trolley.

<doc id="391421" wikidata="Q5155612" url="?curid=391421" title="Comparametric equation">
<text>A comparametric equation is an equation that describes a parametric relationship between a function and a dilated version of the same function, where the equation does not involve the parameter. For example, &quot;ƒ&quot;(2&quot;t&quot;) = 4&quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a comparametric equation, when we define &quot;g&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;ƒ&quot;(2&quot;t&quot;), so that we have &quot;g&quot; = 4&quot;ƒ&quot; no longer contains the parameter, &quot;t&quot;. The comparametric equation &quot;g&quot; = 4&quot;ƒ&quot; has a family of solutions, one of which is &quot;ƒ&quot; = &quot;t&quot;2.
To see that &quot;ƒ&quot; = &quot;t&quot;2 is a solution, we merely substitute back in: &quot;g&quot; = &quot;ƒ&quot;(2&quot;t&quot;) = (2&quot;t&quot;)2 = 4&quot;t&quot;2 = 4&quot;ƒ&quot;, so that &quot;g&quot; = 4&quot;ƒ&quot;.

Comparametric equations arise naturally in signal processing when we have multiple measurements of the same phenomenon, in which each of the measurements was acquired using a different sensitivity. For example, two or more differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter give rise to a comparametric relationship, the solution of which is the response function of the camera, image sensor, or imaging system. In this sense, comparametric equations are the fundamental mathematical basis for HDR (high dynamic range) imaging, as well as HDR audio.

Comparametric equations have been used in many areas of research, and have many practical applications to the real world. They are used in radar, microphone arrays, and have been used in processing crime scene video in homicide trials in which the only evidence against the accused was video recordings of the murder.

== Solution ==
An existing solution is comparametric camera response function (CCRF) for real-time comparametric analysis. It has applications in the analysis of multiple images.

<doc id="391422" wikidata="Q1397450" url="?curid=391422" title="Jan Terlouw">
<text>Jan Cornelis Terlouw (born 15 November 1931) is a retired Dutch politician, physicist and author. A member of the Democrats 66 (D66) party, he served as Deputy Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1981 to 1982 under Prime Minister Dries van Agt.

Terlouw studied Physics and Mathematics at the Utrecht University simultaneously obtaining Master of Physics and Mathematics degree and worked as a researcher at the FOM before finishing his thesis and graduated as a Doctor of Science in Nuclear physics. Terlouw worked as a nuclear physics researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from February 1960 until April 1962, and for the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) from August 1965 until December 1966. After the 1971 general election Terlouw was elected to the House of Representatives on 11 May 1971 and served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for economic affairs and science. After Party Leader and Parliamentary leader Hans van Mierlo announced he was stepping down, Terlouw was unanimously selected as his successor on 1 September 1973.

For the 1977 and 1981 general elections, Terlouw served as lead candidate, and following a cabinet formation with Christian democratic Leader Dries van Agt and Labour Leader Joop den Uyl formed the second Van Agt cabinet, with Terlouw appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Affairs, taking office on 11 September 1981. The cabinet fell just seven months into its term and was replaced with the caretaker third Van Agt cabinet, with Terlouw continuing his offices. For the 1982 general election, Terlouw again served as lead candidate but shortly thereafter announced he was stepping down as Leader on 8 September 1982.

Terlouw continued to be active in politics and in December 1982 he was nominated as the next Secretary-General of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT - evolved in 2006 into the International Transport Forum, ITF) serving from 30 January 1983 until 15 October 1991. In October 1991 Terlouw was nominated as the next Queen&#x27;s Commissioner of Gelderland serving from 1 November 1991 until 1 December 1996. Terlouw also became active in the public sector, and worked as a professor of Urbanization at the University of Amsterdam from January 1997 until January 2000. After the Senate election of 1999 Terlouw was elected as a Member of the Senate serving from 8 June 1999 until 10 June 2003 and served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for the interior, economic affairs and defence.

Terlouw retired from active politics at 71 but continued to be active in the public sector as a non-profit director and served on several state commissions (nl) and councils on behalf of the government, and worked as a professor of Literature at the Tilburg University from September 2003 until September 2004. Following his retirement Terlouw continues to be active as an advocate and activist for social norms, sustainable development, animal welfare and for more European integration. Terlouw is known for his abilities as a consensus builder and negotiator and continues to comment on political affairs as of 2025.

Terlouw has been active as a prolific author since the 1970s, having written more than dozen young adult fiction books: his 1972 novel &quot;Winter in Wartime&quot; was adapted and released as a feature film in 2008.

== Background ==
===Early life and education===
Terlouw was born in Kamperveen, Overijssel and grew up in the Veluwe. He was the eldest son a family of five, having two younger brothers and two sisters.

After high school, Terlouw studied at Utrecht University, where he obtained an MSc degree in mathematics and physics, and a PhD degree in nuclear physics. 

===Career===
After graduating from Utrecht University, he worked as a physics researcher in the Netherlands, the United States, and Sweden.

After working for thirteen years, he became a politician, joining the Dutch House of Representatives (the lower house of the Dutch legislature) as a member of the Democraten 66 political party in 1970.

<doc id="391431" wikidata="Q1162172" url="?curid=391431" title="Volcanic winter">
<text>A volcanic winter is a reduction in global temperatures caused by droplets of sulfuric acid obscuring the Sun and raising Earth&#x27;s albedo (increasing the reflection of solar radiation) after a large, sulfur-rich, particularly explosive volcanic eruption. Climate effects are primarily dependent upon the amount of injection of SO2 and H2S into the stratosphere where they react with OH and H2O to form H2SO4 on a timescale of a week, and the resulting H2SO4 aerosols produce the dominant radiative effect. Volcanic stratospheric aerosols cool the surface by reflecting solar radiation and warm the stratosphere by absorbing terrestrial radiation for several years. Moreover, the cooling trend can be further extended by atmosphere–ice–ocean feedback mechanisms. These feedbacks can continue to maintain the cool climate long after the volcanic aerosols have dissipated.

== Physical process ==
An explosive volcanic eruption releases magma materials in the form of volcanic ash and gases into the atmosphere. While most volcanic ash settles to the ground within a few weeks after the eruption, impacting only the local area for a short duration, the emitted SO2 can lead to the formation of H2SO4 aerosols in the stratosphere. These aerosols can circle the hemisphere of the eruption source in a matter of weeks and persist with an &quot;e&quot;-folding decay time of about a year. As a result, they have a radiative impact that can last for several years.

The subsequent dispersal of a volcanic cloud in the stratosphere and its impact on climate are strongly influenced by several factors, including the season of the eruption, the latitude of the source volcano, and the injection height. If the SO2 injection height remains confined to the troposphere, the resulting H2SO4 aerosols have a residence time of only a few days due to efficient removal through precipitation. The lifetime of H2SO4 aerosols resulting from extratropical eruptions is shorter compared to those from tropical eruptions, due to a longer transport path from the tropics to removal across the mid- or high-latitude tropopause, but extratropical eruptions strengthens the hemispheric climate impact by confining the aerosol to a single hemisphere. Injections in the winter are also much less radiatively efficient than injections during the summer for high-latitude volcanic eruptions, when the removal of stratospheric aerosols in polar regions is enhanced.
The sulfate aerosol interacts strongly with solar radiation through scattering, giving rise to remarkable atmospheric optical phenomena in the stratosphere. These phenomena include solar dimming, coronae or Bishop&#x27;s rings, peculiar twilight coloration, and dark total lunar eclipses. Historical records that documented these atmospheric events are indications of volcanic winters and date back to periods preceding the Common Era.

Surface temperature observations following historic eruptions show that there is no correlation between eruption size, as represented by the VEI or eruption volume, and the severity of the climate cooling. This is because eruption size does not correlate with the amount of SO2 emitted.

=== Long-term positive feedback ===
It has been proposed that the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions can extend beyond the initial several years, lasting for decades to possibly even millennia. This prolonged impact is hypothesized to be a result of positive feedback mechanisms involving ice and ocean dynamics, even after the H2SO4 aerosols have dissipated.

During the first few years following a volcanic eruption, the presence of H2SO4 aerosols can induce a significant cooling effect. This cooling can lead to a widespread lowering of snowline, enabling the rapid expansion of sea ice, ice caps and continental glacier. As a result, ocean temperatures decrease, and surface albedo increases, further reinforcing the expansion of sea ice, ice caps, and glacier. These processes create a strong positive feedback loop, allowing the cooling trend to persist over centennial-scale or even longer periods of time.

It has been proposed that a cluster of closely spaced, large volcanic eruptions triggered or amplified the Little Ice Age, Late Antique Little Ice Age, stadials, Younger Dryas, Heinrich events, and Dansgaard-Oeschger events through the atmosphere-ice-ocean positive feedbacks.

=== Weathering effects ===

The weathering of a sufficiently large volume of rapidly erupted volcanic materials has been proposed as an important factor in Earth&#x27;s silicate weathering cycle, which operates on a timescale of tens of millions of years. During this process, weathered silicate minerals react with carbon dioxide and water, resulting in the formation of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate. These carbonates are then removed from the atmosphere and sequestrated on the ocean floor. The eruption of a large volume of volcanic materials can enhance weathering processes, thereby lowering atmospheric CO2 levels and contributing to global temperature reduction.

The rapid emplacement of mafic large igneous provinces has the potential to cause a swift decline in atmospheric CO2 content, leading to a multi-million-year-long icehouse climate. A notable example is the Sturtian glaciation, which is considered the most severe and widespread known glacial event in Earth&#x27;s history. This glaciation is believed to have been caused by the weathering of erupted Franklin Large Igneous Province.

==Past volcanic coolings==
Tree-ring-based temperature reconstructions, historical records of dust veils, and ice cores studies have confirmed that some of the coldest years during the last five millennia were directly caused by massive volcanic injections of SO2.

Hemispheric temperature anomalies resulting from volcanic eruptions have primarily been reconstructed based on tree-ring data for the past two millennia. For earlier periods in the Holocene, the identification of frost rings that coincide with large ice core sulfate spikes serves as an indicator of severe volcanic winters. The quantification of volcanic coolings further back in time during the Last Glacial Period is made possible by annually resolved δ18O records.
This is a non-exhaustive compilation of notable and consequential coolings that have been definitively attributed to volcanic aerosols, although the source volcanos of the aerosols are rarely identified.

During the Last Glacial Period, volcanic coolings comparable to the largest volcanic coolings during the Common Era (e.g. Tambora, Samalas) are inferred based on the magnitudes of δ18O anomalies. In particular, in the period 12,000–32,000 years ago, the peak δ18O cooling anomaly of the eruptions exceeds the anomaly after the largest eruptions in the Common Era. One Last Glacial Period eruption that have gained significant attention is the eruption of the Youngest Toba Tuff (YTT), which has sparked vigorous debates regarding its climate effects.

=== Youngest Toba Tuff ===

The eruption of YTT from Toba Caldera, 74,000 years ago, is regarded as the largest known Quaternary eruption and two orders of magnitude greater than the magma volume of the largest historical eruption, Tambora. The exceptional magnitude of this eruption has prompted sustained debate as to its global and regional impact on climate.

Sulfate concentration and isotope measurements from polar ice cores taken around the time of 74,000 years BP have identified four atmospheric aerosol events that could potentially be attributed to YTT. The calculated stratospheric sulfate loadings for these four events range from 219 to 535 million tonnes, which is 1 to 3 times greater than that of the Samalas eruption in 1257 CE. Global climate models simulate peak global mean cooling of 2.3 to 4.1 K for this amount of erupted sulfate aerosols, and complete temperature recovery does not occur within 10 years.

Empirical evidence for cooling induced by YTT, however, is mixed. YTT coincides with the onset of Greenland Stadial 20 (GS-20), which is characterized by a 1,500-year cooling period. GS-20 is considered the most isotopically extreme and coldest stadial, as well as having the weakest Asian monsoon, in the last 100,000 years. This timing has led some to speculate on the relation between YTT and GS-20. The stratigraphic position of YTT in relation to the GS-20 transition suggests that the stadial would have occurred without YTT, as the cooling was already underway. There is the possibility that YTT contributed to the extremity of GS-20. The South China Sea shows a 1 K cooling over 1,000 years following the deposition of YTT, while the Arabian Sea shows no discernible impact. In India and the Bay of Bengal, initial cooling and prolonged desiccation are observed above the YTT ash layer, but it is argued that these environmental changes were already occurring prior to YTT. Lake Malawi sediments do not provide evidence supporting a volcanic winter within a few years after the eruption of YTT, but the resolution of the sediments is questioned due to sediment mixing. Directly above the YTT layer in Lake Malawi, there is evidence of a 2,000-year-long megadrought and cooling period. Greenland ice cores identify a 110-year period of accelerated cooling immediately following what is likely the YTT aerosol event.

=== Sturtian glaciation ===
The enhanced weathering of continental flood basalts, which erupted just prior to the onset of the Sturtian glaciation at 717 million years ago, is recognized as the trigger for the most severe glaciation in Earth&#x27;s history. During this period, Earth&#x27;s surface temperatures dropped below the freezing point of water everywhere, and ice rapidly advanced from low latitudes to the equator, covering a worldwide extent. This glaciation lasted almost 60 million years, from 717 to 659 million years ago.

Geochronology dates the rapid emplacement of Franklin large igneous province just 1 million year before the onset of Sturtian glaciation. Multiple large igneous provinces on the scale of were also emplaced on Rodinia between 850 and 720 million years ago. Weathering of massive amount of fresh mafic materials initiated runaway cooling and ice-albedo feedback after 1 million year. Chemical isotopic compositions show a massive flux of weathered freshly erupted materials entering the ocean, coinciding with the eruptions of large igneous provinces. Simulations demonstrate that the increased weatherability led to drop in atmospheric CO2 of the order of 1,320 ppm and an 8 K cooling of global temperatures, triggering the most extraordinary episode of climate change in the geologic record.

==Effects on life==

Population bottlenecksa sharp decrease in the population of a species populationhave been attributed to volcanic winters by some researchers. Such events may diminish populations to &quot;levels low enough for evolutionary changes, which occur much faster in small populations, to produce rapid population differentiation&quot;. With the Lake Toba bottleneck, many species showed the massive genetic effects of this decrease in the gene pool; Toba may have reduced the human population to between 15,000 and 40,000, or even fewer.

<text>An impact winter is a hypothesized period of prolonged cold weather due to the impact of a large asteroid or comet on the Earth&#x27;s surface. If an asteroid were to strike land or a shallow body of water, it would eject an enormous amount of dust, ash, and other material into the atmosphere, blocking the radiation from the Sun. This would cause the global temperature to decrease drastically. If an asteroid or comet with the diameter of about or more were to hit in a large deep body of water or explode before hitting the surface, there would still be an enormous amount of debris ejected into the atmosphere. It has been proposed that an impact winter could lead to mass extinction, wiping out many of the world&#x27;s existing species. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event probably involved an impact winter, and led to mass extinction of most tetrapods weighing more than 25 kilograms (55 pounds).

==Possibility of impact==
Each year, the Earth is hit by diameter meteoroids that deliver an explosion above the surface with the power equivalent of one kiloton of TNT. The Earth is hit every day by a meteor less than in diameter that disintegrates before reaching the surface. The meteors that do make it to the surface tend to strike unpopulated areas and cause no harm. A human is more likely to die in a fire, flood, or other natural disaster than to die because of an asteroid or comet impact. Another study in 1994 found a 1-in-10,000 chance that the Earth will be hit by a large asteroid or comet with a diameter of about during the next century. This object would be capable of disrupting the ecosphere and would kill a large fraction of the world&#x27;s population. One such object, Asteroid 1950 DA, currently has a 0.038% chance of colliding with Earth in the year 2880, though when first discovered the probability was 0.3%. The probability goes down as orbits are refined with additional measurements.

Over 300 short-period comets pass near larger planets, such as Saturn and Jupiter, which can change the comets&#x27; trajectories and could potentially put them into an Earth-crossing orbit. This could happen for long-period comets also but the chance is highest for short-period comets. The chance of these directly impacting Earth is far lower than a near-Earth object (NEO) impact. Victor Clube and Bill Napier support a controversial theory that a short-period comet in an Earth-crossing orbit does not need to impact to be hazardous, as it could disintegrate and cause a dust veil with possibilities of a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; scenario with long-term global cooling lasting for thousands of years (which they consider to be similar in probability to a 1 km impact).

==Necessary impact factors==
The Earth experiences a never-ending barrage of cosmic debris. Small particles burn up as they enter the atmosphere and are visible as meteors. Many of them go unnoticed by the average person even though not all of them burn up before they hit the Earth&#x27;s surface. Those that strike the surface are known as meteorites. Thus, not every object that hits the Earth will cause an extinction-level event or even cause any real harm. Objects release most of their kinetic energy in the atmosphere and will explode if they experience a column of atmosphere greater than or equal to their mass. Extinction-level impacts on the Earth occur about every 100 million years. Although extinction events happen very rarely, large projectiles can do severe damage. This section will discuss the nature of the hazards posed by projectiles as a function of their size and composition.

===Size===
A large asteroid or comet could collide with the Earth&#x27;s surface with the force of hundreds to thousands of times the force of all the nuclear bombs on the Earth. For example, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event has been proposed to have caused extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Early estimates of this asteroid&#x27;s size put it at about in diameter. This means it hit with nearly a force of 100,000,000 MT (418 ZJ). That is over six billion times larger than the atomic bomb yield (16 kilotons, 67 TJ) that was dropped on Hiroshima during WW2. This impactor excavated the Chicxulub crater that is in diameter. With an object this size, dust and debris would still be ejected into the atmosphere even if it hit the ocean, which is only deep. An asteroid, meteor, or comet would remain intact through the atmosphere by virtue of its sheer mass. However, an object smaller than would have to have a strong iron composition to breach the lower atmosphere - the troposphere or the lower levels of the stratosphere.

===Composition===
There are three different composition types for an asteroid or comet: metallic, stony and icy. The composition of the object determines whether or not it will make it to the Earth&#x27;s surface in one piece, disintegrate before breaching the atmosphere, or break up and explode just before reaching the surface. A metallic object tends to be made up of iron and nickel alloys. These metallic objects are the most likely to impact the surface because they stand up better to the stresses of ram pressure induced flattening and fragmentation during deceleration in the atmosphere. The stony objects, like chondritic meteorites, tend to burn, break up, or explode before leaving the upper atmosphere. Those that do make it to the surface need a minimum energy of about or about diameter to breach the lower atmosphere (this is for a stony object hitting at ). The porous comet-like objects are made up of low-density silicates, organics, ice, volatile and often burn up in the upper atmosphere because of their low bulk density (≤).

==Possible mechanisms==

Although the asteroids and comets that impact the Earth hit with many times the explosive force of a volcano, the mechanisms of an impact winter are similar to those that occur after a mega-volcanic eruption-induced volcanic winter. In this scenario massive amounts of debris injected into the atmosphere would block some of the Sun&#x27;s radiation for an extended period of time and lower the mean global temperature by as much as 20 °C after a year. The two main mechanisms that could lead to an impact winter are mass ejection of regolith and multiple firestorms.

===Mass ejection of regolith===

In a study conducted by Curt Covey et al., it was found that an asteroid about in diameter with the explosive force of about 108 MT could send upward of about 2.5x1015 kg of 1 μm sized aerosol particles into the atmosphere. Anything larger would fall quickly back to the surface. These particles would then be spread throughout the atmosphere and absorb or refract the sunlight before it is able to reach the surface, cooling the planet in a similar fashion as the sulfurous aerosol rising from a megavolcano, producing deep global dimming. This is controversially purported to have occurred following the Toba eruption.

These pulverized rock particles would remain in the atmosphere until dry deposition and due to their size, they would also act as cloud condensation nuclei and would be washed out by wet deposition/precipitation, but even then, about 15% of the sun&#x27;s radiation might not reach the surface. After the first 20 days, the land temperature might drop quickly, by about 13 °C. After about a year, the temperature could rebound by about 6 °C, but by this time about one-third of the Northern Hemisphere might be covered in ice.

However, this effect could be largely mitigated, even reversed, by a release of enormous quantities of water vapor and carbon dioxide caused by the initial global heat pulse after the impact. If the asteroid hit an ocean (which would be the case with the majority of impact events), water vapor would form the majority of any ejected matter, and would likely result in a major greenhouse effect and a net increase in temperature.

If the impact event is sufficiently energetic it might cause mantle plume (volcanism) at the antipodal point (the opposite side of the world). This volcanism could alone therefore create a volcanic winter, irrespective of the other impact effects.

===Multiple firestorms===

In combination with the initial debris ejected into the atmosphere, if the impactor is extremely large ( or more), like at the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event (estimated ), there might be the ignition of multiple fire storms, possibly with a global reach into every dense and therefore firestorm-prone forest. These wood fires might release enough amounts of water vapor, ash, soot, tar and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to perturb the climate on their own and cause the pulverized rock dust cloud blocking the sun to last longer. Alternatively it could cause it to last for a much shorter time, as there would be more water vapor for the rocky aerosol particles to form cloud condensation nuclei. If it causes the dust cloud to last longer, it would prolong the Earth&#x27;s cooling time, possibly causing thicker ice sheets to form.

== Past events==

In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the Chicxulub impact crater to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. This crater is one of the best known impact craters and was the impact responsible for the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.

The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects. They confirmed that the rock comprising the peak ring had been subjected to immense pressures and forces, and had been melted by immense heat and shocked by immense pressure from its usual state into its present form in just minutes. The fact that the peak ring was made of granite was also significant, since granite is not a rock found in sea-floor deposits – it originates much deeper in the earth and had been ejected to the surface by the immense pressures of impact. Gypsum, a sulfate-containing rock that &quot;is&quot; usually present in the shallow seabed of the region, had been almost entirely removed and must therefore have been almost entirely vaporized and entered the atmosphere, and that the event was immediately followed by a huge megatsunami (a massive movement of sea waters) sufficient to lay down the largest known layer of sand separated by grain size directly above the peak ring.

These strongly support the hypothesis that the impactor was large enough to create a 120-mile peak ring, eject molten granite from deep within the earth, create colossal water movements, and eject an immense quantity of vaporized rock and sulfates into the atmosphere, where they would have persisted for a long time. This global dispersion of dust and sulfates would have led to a sudden and catastrophic effect on the climate worldwide by causing large temperature drops, devastating the food chain.

==Impact on humans==

An impact winter would have a devastating effect on humans, as well as the other species on Earth. With the sun&#x27;s radiation being severely diminished, the first species to die would be plants and animals who survive through the process of photosynthesis. This lack of food would ultimately lead to other mass extinctions of other animals that are higher up on the food chain and possibly kill up to 25% of the human population. Depending on location and size of the initial impact, the cost of clean-up efforts could be so high as to cause an economic crisis for the survivors. These factors would make life on Earth, for humans, extremely difficult.

===Agriculture===

With the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere full of dust and other material, radiation from the sun would be refracted and scattered back into space and absorbed by this debris. The first effect on the Earth, after the blast wave and potential multiple fire storms, would be the death of most, if not all, of the photosynthetic life forms on Earth. Those in the ocean that survive would possibly become dormant until the sun came out again. Those on land could possibly be kept alive in underground microclimates, with one such example being the Zbrašov aragonite caves. Greenhouses in underground complexes with fossil or nuclear energy power stations could conceivably keep artificial sunlight growing lamps on until the atmosphere began to clear. Meanwhile, those outside that were not killed by the lack of sunlight would most likely be killed or kept dormant by the extreme cold of the impact winter. This death of plants might lead to a long period of famine if enough people survived the initial blast wave and would result in increased food costs in undeveloped countries only a few months after the first crop failures. Developed countries wouldn&#x27;t encounter famine unless the cooling event was to last longer than a year, due to larger canned food and grain stockpiles in these countries. However, if the impactor was similar in size to the K/T boundary impactor, agricultural losses might not be compensated with imports to the northern hemisphere from the southern hemisphere or vice versa. The only way to keep from starving would be for each country to amass at least a year&#x27;s worth of food for their people. Not many countries have this; the world&#x27;s average cereal stock levels are only about 30% of the yearly production.

===Economics===
The cost to clean up after an asteroid or comet impact would cost billions to trillions of dollars, depending on the location impacted. An impact in New York City (the 16th most populated city in the world) could cost billions of dollars in financial losses and it could take years for the financial sector (i.e. stock market) to recover. However, the probability of such a naturally specifically aimed impact would be exceedingly low.

===Survivability===

, there are 17,841 near-Earth objects known. 8,059 potentially hazardous objects are known; they are larger than and may approach the Earth closer than 20 times the distance to the Moon. 888 NEAs larger than 1 km have been discovered, or 96.5% of an estimated total of about 920.

<doc id="391436" wikidata="Q228710" url="?curid=391436" title="Symphony No. 39 (Haydn)">
<text>Symphony No. 39 is a symphony in G minor (Hoboken 1/39) by Franz Joseph Haydn in 1765, at the age of 33 under the beneficence of Prince Nikolaus Esterházy. It is the earliest of Haydn&#x27;s minor key symphonies associated with his &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; period works (such as the &quot;Symphony No. 45&quot;).

==Movements==
It is written for an orchestra consisting of two oboes, four horns (two in B alto and two in G), and strings (violins divided into two, violas, cellos and double basses). There are four movements:

#Allegro assai, 
#Andante, in E major
#Menuet &amp; Trio, 
#Finale: Allegro di molto, 

The opening movement features a nervously exciting main theme interrupted by frequent pauses. Felix Diergarten has specifically analysed the pauses in the first movement in the symphony, with respect to symphonic form of the time. Both the first and second theme groups begin with the same two bars of melodic material.

In contrast to the Sturm und Drang of the opening movement, A. P. Brown describes the Andante as &quot;one of Haydn&#x27;s most &quot;galant&quot; slow movements, with its small meter signature, sixteenth triplets, slides, weak resolutions, echoes, and generally thin texture&quot;.

The minor mode returns for the Menuet which is contrasted by a bright major-mode Trio which features high notes for the first horn.

The frenetic Sturm und Drang finale brings the symphony to an energetic conclusion.

<doc id="391442" wikidata="Q299468" url="?curid=391442" title="Ashur-uballit I">
<text>Ashur-uballit I &quot;(Aššur-uballiṭ I)&quot;, who reigned between 1363 and 1328 BC, was the first king of the Middle Assyrian Empire. After his father Eriba-Adad I had broken Mitanni influence over Assyria, Ashur-uballit I&#x27;s defeat of the Mitanni king Shuttarna III marks Assyria&#x27;s ascendancy over the Hurri-Mitanni Empire, and the beginning of its emergence as a powerful empire. Later on, due to disorder in Babylonia following the death of the Kassite king Burnaburiash II, Ashur-uballit established Kurigalzu II on the Babylonian throne, in the first of what would become a series of Assyrian interventions in Babylonian affairs.

== Family and personal life ==
Burnaburiash married Muballitat-Sherua of Assyria, the daughter of Ashur-uballit I. Together, they had at least one son, Prince Kara-hardash. They may also have been the parents of Kurigalzu II, or his grandparents.

== Amarna letters ==
From the Amarna letters, a series of diplomatic letters from various Middle Eastern monarchs to Amenhotep III and Akhenaten of Egypt, we find two letters from Ashur-uballit I, the second being a follow-up letter to the first. In the letters, Ashur-uballit refers to his second predecessor Ashur-nadin-ahhe II as his &quot;father&quot; or &quot;ancestor,&quot; rather than his actual father, Eriba-Adad I, which has led some critics of conventional Egyptian chronology, such as David Rohl, to claim that the Ashur-uballit of the Amarna letters was not the same as Ashur-uballit I. This, however, ignores the fact that monarchs in the Amarna letters frequently refer to predecessors as their &quot;father,&quot; even if they were not their biological sons. In this case, Ashur-uballit presumably referred to Ashur-nadin-ahhe because the latter, unlike Eriba-Adad I, had previously corresponded with the Egyptian court.

== Babylonian wars ==

With Assyrian power firmly established, Ashur-uballit started to make contacts with other great nations. His messages to the Egyptians angered his Babylonian neighbour Burnaburiash II, who himself wrote to the Pharaoh: “with regard to my Assyrian vassals, it was not I who sent them to you. Why did they go to your country without proper authority? If you are loyal to me they will not negotiate any business. Send them to me empty-handed!” 
== Legacy ==
Prince Kara-hardash succeeded his father. A revolt soon broke out that showed the unpopularity of the Assyrians. Asshur-uballit would not allow his grandson to be cast aside, and duly invaded Babylon. Because Kara-Hardash was killed in the rebellion, the Assyrians placed on the Babylonian throne Kurigalzu II. But this new puppet king did not remain loyal to his master, and soon invaded Assyria. Ashur-uballit stopped the Babylonian army at Sugagu, not far south from the capital Assur.

Ashur-uballit I then counterattacked, and invaded Babylonia, appropriating hitherto Babylonian territory in central Mesopotamia, and forcing a treaty in Assyria&#x27;s favour upon Kurigalzu.

<text>The Scroll and Key Society is a secret society, founded in 1842 at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut. It is one of the oldest Yale secret societies and reputedly the wealthiest. The society is one of the reputed &quot;Big Three&quot; societies at Yale, along with Skull and Bones and Wolf&#x27;s Head. Each spring the society admits 15 rising seniors to participate in its activities and carry on its traditions.

==History==
Scroll and Key was established by John Addison Porter, with aid from several members of the Class of 1842 (including Leonard Case Jr. and Theodore Runyon) and a member of the Class of 1843 (William L. Kingsley), after disputes over elections to Skull and Bones Society. Kingsley is the namesake of the alumni organization, the Kingsley Trust Association (KTA), incorporated years after its founding.

Lyman Hotchkiss Bagg wrote that &quot;up until as recent a date as 1860, Keys had great difficulty in making up its crowd, rarely being able to secure the full fifteen upon the night of giving out its elections.&quot; However, the society was on the upswing: &quot;the old order of things, however, has recently come to an end, and Keys is now in possession of a hall far superior...not only to Bones hall, but to any college-society hall in America.&quot;

In addition to financing its activities, Scroll and Key has made significant donations to Yale over the years. The John Addison Porter Prize, awarded annually since 1872, and in 1917 the endowment for the founding of the Yale University Press, which has funded the publication of The Yale Shakespeare and sponsored the Yale Younger Poets Series, are gifts from &quot;Keys&quot;.

==Traditions==
* At the close of Thursday and Sunday sessions, members are known to sing the &quot;Troubadour&quot; song on the front steps of the Society&#x27;s hall, a remnant of the tradition of public singing at Yale. The song (written in the 1820s by Thomas Haynes Bayly) was recorded by Tennessee Ernie Ford on his 1956 album, &quot;This Lusty Land&quot;, as &quot;Gaily the Troubador&quot;.
* In keeping with the practice of adopting secret letters or symbols such as Skull and Bones&#x27; &quot;322,&quot; Manuscript&#x27;s &quot;344,&quot; and the Pundits&#x27; &quot;T.B.I.Y.T.B,&quot; Scroll and Key is known to use the letters &quot;C.S.P. and C.C.J.&quot;
* Members of the society sign letters to each other &quot;YiT&quot;, as opposed to Skull and Bones&#x27; &quot;yours in 322&quot;.
* Outside of its tap-related activities, the society has been known to hold two major annual events called &quot;Z Session&quot;.

== Tomb ==

The society&#x27;s building, called a &quot;tomb&quot;, was designed in the Moorish Revival style by Richard Morris Hunt and constructed in 1870. A later expansion was completed in 1901. Architectural historian Patrick Pinnell includes an in-depth discussion of Keys&#x27; building in his 1999 history of Yale&#x27;s campus, relating the then-notable cost overruns associated with the Keys structure and its aesthetic significance within the campus landscape. Pinnell&#x27;s history shares the fact that the land was purchased from another Yale secret society, Berzelius (at that time, a Sheffield Scientific School society).

Regarding the tomb&#x27;s distinctive appearance, Pinnell noted that &quot;19th-century artists&#x27; studios commonly had exotic orientalia lying about to suggest that the painter was sophisticated, well traveled, and in touch with mysterious powers; Hunt&#x27;s Scroll and Key is one instance in which the trope got turned into a building.&quot; Later, undergraduates described the building as a &quot;striped zebra Billiard Hall&quot; in a supplement to a Yale yearbook. More recently, it has been described by an undergraduate publication as being &quot;the nicest building in all of New Haven&quot;.

== Membership ==
Scroll and Key taps annually a delegation of fifteen, composed of men and women of the junior class, to serve the following year. Membership is offered to a diverse group of highly accomplished juniors, specifically those who have &quot;achieved in any field, academic, extra-curricular, or personal&quot;. Delegations frequently include editors of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; and other publications, artists and musicians, social and political activists, athletes of distinction, entrepreneurs, and high-achieving scholars.

Mark Twain was an honorary member, under the auspices of Joseph Twichell, Yale College Class of 1859.

<text>The Sons of the Pioneers are one of the United States&#x27; earliest Western singing groups. Known for their vocal performances, their musicianship, and their songwriting, they produced innovative recordings that have inspired many Western music performers and remained popular through the years. Since 1933, through many changes in membership, the Sons of the Pioneers have remained one of the longest-surviving country music vocal groups.

==Origins==
In the spring of 1931, Ohio-born Leonard Slye, the cowboy singer who would later change his name to Roy Rogers, arrived in California and found work as a truck driver, and later as a fruit picker for the Del Monte company in California&#x27;s Central Valley. He entered an amateur singing contest on a Los Angeles radio show called Midnight Frolics and a few days later got an invitation to join a group called the Rocky Mountaineers.

In September 1931, Canadian-born Bob Nolan answered a classified ad in the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; that read, &quot;Yodeler for old-time act, to travel. Tenor preferred.&quot; The band was The Rocky Mountaineers, by then led by Leonard Slye. After listening to the tall, slender, tanned Nolan sing and yodel, Slye hired Nolan on the spot. Although Nolan stayed with the group only a short time, he stayed in touch with Slye. Nolan was replaced by Tim Spencer, who had been working in a Safeway Stores warehouse.

In the spring of 1932, Slye, Spencer, and another singer, Slumber Nichols, left the Rocky Mountaineers to form a trio, which soon failed. Throughout most of 1932, Slye and Spencer moved through a series of short-lived groups like the International Cowboys and the O-Bar-O Cowboys. Spencer left the O-Bar-O Cowboys and quit music for a while. Slye joined Jack LeFevre and His Texas Outlaws, who were a popular act on a local Los Angeles radio station.

In early 1933, Slye, Nolan, and Spencer formed a group called the Pioneer Trio. The three young singers rehearsed for weeks honing their singing. While Slye continued to work with his radio singing group, Spencer and Nolan began writing songs for the group.

==Early success==
By early 1934, the group consisted of Leonard Slye, Bob Nolan, and Tim Spencer on vocals, with Nolan playing string bass and Slye playing rhythm guitar. During that time, fiddle player Hugh Farr joined the group, adding a bass voice to the group&#x27;s vocal arrangements. He also sang lead on some songs. Later that year, the &quot;Pioneers Trio&quot; became the &quot;Sons of the Pioneers&quot; through a radio station announcer&#x27;s chance remark. Asked why he&#x27;d changed their name, the announcer said they were too young to have been pioneers, but that they could be sons of pioneers. The name was received well and fit the group, who were no longer a trio.

By the summer of 1934, the Sons of the Pioneers&#x27; popularity and fame extended beyond the Los Angeles area and quickly spread across the United States through short syndicated radio segments that were rebroadcast all over the country. They signed a recording contract with the newly founded Decca label, and on August 8, 1934, the Sons of the Pioneers made their first commercial recording. That same day, the immensely popular crooner Bing Crosby also made his first Decca session.

One of the first songs recorded by the Sons of the Pioneers during that first August session was written by Bob Nolan, &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot;, that would soon become a staple in their repertoire. The original title &quot;Tumbling Leaves&quot; was changed to give the song a western character. Over the next two years the group would record 32 songs for Decca. Their output includes a 1937 recording of &quot;The Blue Juniata,&quot; by Marion Dix Sullivan.

==Motion pictures==
Between 1935 and 1984, the Sons of the Pioneers appeared in 87 films, several short films, and a television series. In 1935 they signed with Columbia Pictures to supply the music for the studio&#x27;s Charles Starrett westerns. In 1937, Leonard Slye was offered a contract as an actor with rival Republic Pictures. Part of that deal required him to leave the singing group. Leonard Slye was rechristened Roy Rogers, and went on to achieve major success as a singing cowboy in the movies. Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers remained close throughout the coming years. When the Starrett unit disbanded temporarily at the end of the 1941 season, the Pioneers rejoined Rogers at Republic and were soon appearing as highly popular supporting players in the Rogers westerns.

By this time the group was billed as &quot;Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers.&quot; Nolan was reluctant to be the &quot;leader&quot; of the group, which had been formed as a co-operative outfit with no formal leader, but he bowed to the demands of show business. Agents, music publishers, and recording companies insisted that co-operative bands needed a name to promote them (as in Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra). Because Bob Nolan&#x27;s featured appearances with Starrett had made him the most recognizable of the Pioneers, Nolan reluctantly became the &quot;front&quot; for the group. The group, as &quot;Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers,&quot; made guest appearances in the Warner Bros. all-star revue &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944, singing &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot;) and the RKO Hollywood-themed comedy &quot;Ding Dong Williams&quot; (1945, singing &quot;Cool Water&quot;).

==Radio==
The Sons of the Pioneers always valued radio exposure, and appeared often on radio broadcasts. They had three network shows of their own: &quot;10-2-4 Ranch&quot; (1941–45, for Dr Pepper), &quot;Radio Rodeo&quot; (for the Mutual Broadcasting System, 1941–42), and &quot;The Lucky U Ranch&quot; (1951–53, for Planters Peanuts).

The group also began making transcription records for broadcast in 1934. These were syndicated by Standard Transcriptions (1934–36), Mutual (1939, as &quot;The Sunshine Ranch&quot;), RCA (1940, as &quot;Symphonies of the Sage&quot;), the Armed Forces Radio Service (1942–45, as &quot;Melody Roundup&quot;), and Teleways (1947–49, as &quot;The Sons of the Pioneers Show&quot;).

The Teleways series was intended as a daily 15-minute show but could be programmed anywhere on a station&#x27;s schedule, at the station&#x27;s discretion. The group prepared a demonstration record for radio stations and their potential local sponsors, with announcer Art Gilmore reading promotional copy between songs. The informal, semi-scripted show had Bob Nolan acting as master of ceremonies, bantering with the other singers between numbers. The group was careful to program a variety of choral music, including cowboy songs, barbershop harmony, sentimental ballads, and spirituals, to appeal to the widest possible audience. The personnel were Bob Nolan, Tim Spencer, Lloyd Perryman, Pat Brady, Hugh &quot;Foghorn&quot; Farr, Karl Farr, and Ken Carson. The earliest shows include studio musician Ivan Ditmars accompanying them on piano and organ; Nolan appreciated Ditmars&#x27;s efforts but preferred that the group&#x27;s established sound should be preserved for the radio series, so Ditmars was released. Toward the end of the run, as an economic measure saving both time and money, the later Teleways shows were patched together from previous programs (including some songs with Ditmars), with new spoken dialogue by Nolan and the gang connecting the older performances.

==Changes==
Republic Pictures president Herbert Yates released the Sons of the Pioneers from their movie contract in 1948, replacing them with a less expensive alternative, Foy Willing&#x27;s Riders of the Purple Sage. The hurried nature of the Sons of the Pioneers&#x27; last radio shows reflected Tim Spencer&#x27;s and Bob Nolan&#x27;s anxiousness to move on; both left the group in 1949, after their radio commitments had been fulfilled. Tim Spencer retired from performing with the group, to devote himself to handling the group&#x27;s business interests; his place in the group was taken by singer Ken Curtis. Bob Nolan was replaced by Tommy Doss, who sounded almost exactly like him. Lloyd Perryman took over Nolan&#x27;s emcee duties. Nolan returned to the group in 1955 at the insistence of RCA Victor, which valued the group&#x27;s distinctive sound with Nolan, and refused to record the Sons of the Pioneers unless Nolan was present. Nolan&#x27;s participation was limited to RCA records through 1958; he no longer appeared with the group. Similarly, Tim Spencer still participated in the RCA recording sessions through 1957. Hugh Farr retired from the group in 1959 and his brother, guitarist Karl Farr, died in 1961. The group continued to record new albums for RCA through the 1960s, the last being a collection of Hawaiian songs, &quot;The Sons of the Pioneers Visit the South Seas&quot; (1969).

==End of an era==
In 1971, Bob Nolan and Tim Spencer were both elected to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 1972, most of the surviving members of the Sons of the Pioneers, including the original Pioneer Trio of Roy Rogers, Bob Nolan, and Tim Spencer, gathered at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles for one last performance.

The late 1970s saw the passing of the founding members of the group. Tim Spencer died on April 26, 1976. Lloyd Perryman, who had been with the group since 1936, died on May 31, 1977. Hugh Farr, who had retired from the group in 1958, died on April 17, 1980.

In 1979, Bob Nolan returned to the studio for the final time and recorded a successful solo album of classics and newer compositions titled &quot;Bob Nolan – The Sound of a Pioneer&quot;. Nolan died on June 16, 1980. That same year, the Sons of the Pioneers were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Sons of the Pioneers today==
The Sons of the Pioneers have never stopped performing since their inception in 1934. Following the death of Lloyd Perryman in 1977, Dale Warren, who had joined the group in 1952, took over the leadership of the Sons of the Pioneers, guiding them into the 2000s until his death on August 8, 2008. They continued to perform in concert and recorded as well, with a lineup that featured, among many others, Luther Nallie (guitar, vocals), Rusty Richards (vocals), Billy Armstrong (fiddle), Billy Liebert (accordion), Gary LeMaster (lead guitar), Rome Johnson (vocals), and Roy (&quot;Dusty&quot;) Rogers Jr. (vocals, MC), the founder&#x27;s son, who appeared with the group from 2018 until his retirement in 2023.

The current Sons of the Pioneers are &quot;trail boss&quot; Tommy Nallie (vocals, lead guitar), who joined the group in 1983; Ken Lattimore (vocals, fiddle), John Fullerton (vocals, rhythm guitar), Paul Elliott (fiddle, vocals), and Chuck Ervin (bass, vocals).

==Legacy==
In addition to their appearances and filmed performances, their music was used in numerous other films and television shows. and for John Ford movies &quot;Wagon Master&quot; in 1949 and &quot;Rio Grande&quot; in 1950, and performed the theme song for the John Ford classic &quot;The Searchers&quot; in 1956.

In 1977, the Smithsonian Institution, which designates certain artists and performers who have made a noteworthy contribution to the arts and culture of America, named the Sons of the Pioneers as &quot;National Treasures&quot;.

In 1995, the Sons of the Pioneers were inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

In 2001, a book about the group was published, titled &quot;The Sons of the Pioneers&quot; by Bill O&#x27;Neal and Fred Goodwin. Another book about the group, first published in 1974, is called &quot;Hear My Song, The Story of the Celebrated Sons of the Pioneers&quot; by Ken Griffis, and is available on The Pioneers&#x27; website.

Later notable appearances include:
* An appearance along with Roy Rogers in January 1983 in season 2, episode 11 of the TV show &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, titled &quot;Happy Trails&quot;.
* An appearance on Austin City Limits in season 9, episode 12, titled &quot;Country Legends with Faron Young, Kitty Wells, Sons of the Pioneers, Joe &amp; Rose Maphis, Pee Wee King &amp; Red Stewart, Johnny Wright, &amp; The Collins Sisters&quot;. The episode was taped in Austin, TX on March 7, 1984.
* &quot;Tumbling Tumbleweeds&quot; was used in the Coen Brothers film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; in 1998.

The Sons of the Pioneers were the first Country and Western group to sing at Carnegie Hall, and the first to perform at the lavish nightclubs in Las Vegas. The group has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6845 Hollywood Blvd. for recording.

Pioneertown, California was named for the Sons of the Pioneers who were original investors. It was built in 1946 as an old west movie set.

The Sons of the Pioneers Transcription Disc Collection resides at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill within the Southern Folklife Collection.

<text>Walker, Texas Ranger is an American action crime television series created by Leslie Greif and Paul Haggis. It was inspired by the film &quot;Lone Wolf McQuade&quot;, with both the film and the series starring Chuck Norris as a member of the Texas Ranger Division. The show aired on CBS in the spring of 1993, with the first season consisting of three pilot episodes. Eight full seasons followed with new episodes airing from September 25, 1993, to May 19, 2001, and reruns continuing on CBS until July 28, 2001. It has been broadcast in over 100 countries and spawned a 2005 television film entitled &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;. The film ended on a cliffhanger, which was never resolved. DVD sets of all seasons have been released (with the three pilots packaged with the first regular season). At various times since 1997, reruns of the show have aired, in syndication, on the USA Network and Action in Canada. Reruns are currently seen on CBS Action, WGN America, CMT, INSP, getTV, Pluto TV, Heroes &amp; Icons, Grit, 10 Bold, Peacock TV, Up TV and Hulu.

The series was noted for its moralistic style. The characters refrained from the use of drugs and participated in community service. Martial arts were displayed prominently as the primary tool of law enforcement and occasionally as a tool for Walker and company to reach out to the community.

A reboot entitled &quot;Walker&quot;, starring Jared Padalecki, debuted on The CW in 2021, where it ran for four seasons.

==Premise==
The show was initially developed by executive producer Allison Moore and supervising producer J. Michael Straczynski when the series was still being produced by Cannon Television. While Straczynski had to depart to get his new series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; on the air, executive producer David Moessinger remained to finish developing the series. The show is centered on Sergeant Cordell Walker (Norris), a Dallas–Fort Worth–based member of the Texas Rangers, a state-level bureau of investigation. Walker was raised by his paternal uncle, an American Indian named Ray Firewalker (Floyd Red Crow Westerman, pilot episode, season 1; Apesanahkwat, season 2). The surname is, possibly, a nod to the 1986 Norris film, &quot;Firewalker&quot;. Cordell, prior to joining the Rangers, served in the Marines&#x27; elite Recon unit during the Vietnam War. Both Cordell and Uncle Ray share the values characteristic of Wild West sheriffs.

His partner and best friend is James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Trivette (Clarence Gilyard), a former Dallas Cowboys player, &quot;Go Long Trivette&quot;, who takes a more modern approach. Walker&#x27;s young partner grew up in Baltimore and used football as his ticket to college education. He was dropped from the team after he tore up his shoulder in a major game, which led to his career in the Rangers (often making references to watching the &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; and how C.D. Parker mentored him as a rookie officer). Trivette also works inside the office using computers and cellular phones to collate information of the people who have been taken into custody.

Walker also works closely with (and shares a mutual attraction to) Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Cahill (Sheree J. Wilson), a Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney, who on occasion puts up a frown if Walker does not obtain results in time. He also gets advice on cases from C.D. Parker (Gailard Sartain, pilot season; Noble Willingham, seasons 1–7), a veteran Ranger (later inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame) who worked with Walker (and is the only character on the show to address Walker by his first name Cordell on a regular basis) until retiring to operate a small restaurant and bar called &quot;CD&#x27;s Bar and Grill&quot;, a restaurant widely known in the series for its chili. In season 7, two rookie Texas Rangers, Sydney Cooke (Nia Peeples), and Francis Gage (Judson Mills), are assigned under Walker and Trivette&#x27;s command.

The series was well known during its run for its product placement deal with Chrysler, especially its Dodge division. After Walker used a GMC Sierra during the first season, he switched to the Dodge Ram (which at the start of the second season was completely redesigned for 1994), which would be advertised during commercial breaks. Other members of the cast often used other Chrysler vehicles, while villains would drive vehicles from General Motors or Ford Motor Company. This was not unlike &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, which exclusively used Ford vehicles due to a sponsorship deal with Andy Griffith. Coincidentally, the show ended just as Dodge was getting ready to redesign the Ram again for the 2002 model year. However the 2006 Dodge Ram SRT-10 was used in the movie &quot;Trial by Fire&quot;, driven by Walker.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==


===Main===
* Chuck Norris as Texas Ranger Sergeant Cordell Walker, a former Marine and a modern-day Ranger who believes in the Code of the Old West. He is a decorated Vietnam vet and a martial arts expert. He is the show&#x27;s main protagonist.
* Clarence Gilyard as Texas Ranger Sergeant James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Trivette, Walker&#x27;s partner and best friend. He is former professional football player for the Dallas Cowboys where he was a wide receiver.
* Sheree J. Wilson as Tarrant County Assistant D.A. Alexandra &quot;Alex&quot; Cahill, whom Walker later dates for a few seasons and finally marries.
* Gailard Sartain (pilot) and Noble Willingham (seasons 1–7) as retired Texas Ranger Captain C.D. Parker, Walker&#x27;s buddy and ex-partner who owns a bar-restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, and is the only one to address Walker by his first name Cordell regularly. He regularly assists Walker and Trivette. C.D. was written out midway the seventh season (due to Willingham leaving the show to run for Congress), with it said that he is on a cruise around the world, which leaves him unable to attend Walker and Alex&#x27;s wedding. He later unexpectedly dies off-screen early in the final season while on a fishing trip, presumably of a heart attack, but the series finale ultimately reveals that C.D. was murdered by ricin poisoning by Emile Lavocat, as the start of a revenge plot against the Company B Texas Rangers.
* Floyd Westerman (pilot season–season 1) and Apesanahkwat (guest season 2) as Walker&#x27;s paternal uncle Ray Firewalker, also known as Uncle Ray. He raised Cordell after his parents – John and Elizabeth Firewalker – were murdered. Ray disappears at the end of the second season and is later revealed to have died during the fifth season episode &quot;Lucas&quot;.
* Jimmy Wlcek as Trent Malloy (recurring seasons 4–5; main season 6), son of a pastor and former martial arts student of Walker. He is a black belt in Karate and runs both his own Dojo and Protection Agency. He also often teams up with Walker and Trivette on cases.
* Marco Sanchez as Detective Carlos Sandoval (recurring seasons 4–5; main season 6), a detective for Dallas PD, and the best friend of Trent Malloy. He often teams up with Walker and Trivette on cases.
* Judson Mills as Texas Ranger Francis Gage (seasons 7–8), a rookie Ranger who joins Walker in the series&#x27; seventh season.
* Nia Peeples as Texas Ranger Sydney Cooke (seasons 7–8), another rookie Ranger who joins Walker in the series&#x27; seventh season.

===Supporting===
* Cynthia Dorn as M.E. Mary Williams, a medical examiner in most of the murder cases that occurred on the show.
* James Drury as Texas Ranger Captain Tom Price, Walker&#x27;s and Trivette&#x27;s supervisor. He only appears during the pilot season.
* Vanessa Paul as Josie Martin, who runs a &#x27;H.O.P.E.&#x27; center created by Alex after a near-death experience. One of Alex&#x27;s bridesmaids at Alex and Walker&#x27;s wedding.
* Frank Salsedo as White Eagle, the spiritual leader of the Cherokee reservation Walker grew up on, who debuts during season 3.
* Rod Taylor as Gordon Cahill, the once-estranged father of Alex, who is also an Attorney.
* Eloy Casados as Sheriff Sam Coyote, the sheriff of the Cherokee reservation and a very good friend of Walker.
* Peter Onorati as Sergeant Vincent Rosetti, a New York Police Sergeant with a strong New York accent, and who is a little arrogant.
* Terry Kiser as Charlie Brooks, a clumsy and fast-talking informant for Walker and Trivette.
* Robert Fuller as Ranger Wade Harper, a retired El Paso Texas Ranger who came on board to work for Walker and Trivette. Previously, Robert Fuller appeared another character – Cabe Wallace, a 19th-century Texas Ranger – in one episode.
* Julia Nickson as Dr. Susan Lee, a geneticist who had been kidnapped three times throughout her appearances and the mother of Davey.
* Wayne Pere as Victor LaRue, one of Walker&#x27;s archenemies who repeatedly tried to rape Alex until he was shot dead in his final appearance, &quot;Trial of LaRue&quot;.

===Critical reception===
In October 1993, Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the series a C+.

Critic &quot;Average Joe&quot; Queenan thoroughly roasted the series, particularly over targeting a wider audience than suited for its late-night timeslot. He called the show &quot;...so corny and predictable that it appears to be in slow-motion even when it&#x27;s not...With plotlines that were old when George Burns was young, acting that makes William Shatner seem like Marlon Brando, and dialogue that could stop &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; dead in its tracks...Most episodes of the series are completely unwatchable -- although, to the producers&#x27; credit, many are scripted so that Chuck Norris doesn&#x27;t need to talk much...While Norris indeed has a number of successful and well-received screen projects under his belt, here is the first and only time I recall that he was trusted with performing his own theme music. He is no Roy Orbison...I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re even using a DP on this show; it seems that they just mount a camera on a tripod and tell Chuck to start kicking people&#x27;s faces in for a solid hour, which he seems more than willing to do.&quot;

===Recognition===
On December 2, 2010, Rick Perry the 47th Governor of Texas named the Norris brothers Honorary Texas Ranger Captains for their work on the series. In his speech he said that &quot;together, they helped elevate our Texas Rangers to truly mythical status.&quot;

==Home media==
Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS Home Entertainment have both released all seasons on DVD in Region 1. &quot;The Complete 1st Season&quot; contains the three pilot episodes and the first full season being labeled as just the first season. This has confused some fans, as the episodes are wrongly numbered. Seasons 1–6 have been released in regions 2–4.

On May 12, 2015, CBS DVD released &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger – The Complete Collection&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

As of December 2023, the entire series is available digitally in the US, available on both iTunes and Vudu, either as separate seasons or in a complete series set., as well as Google TV (and by extension YouTube TV) which are only sold as separate seasons. Unlike the DVD releases the seasons in the digital releases are correctly numbered.

==Spin-offs and merchandise==
===Television films===

CBS broadcast the television film &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire&quot;, produced by Paramount Network Television (now CBS Studios), on October 16, 2005. Chuck Norris, Sheree J. Wilson and Judson Mills reprised their roles, and Clarence Gilyard shot a cameo for the film but was not featured due to the filming&#x27;s conflict with a long-planned family vacation. To fill the void, Judson Mills, who was not in the original script, returned to reprise the role of Francis Gage. Nia Peeples, who played the role of Sydney Cooke for seasons 7 and 8, was also not featured in Walker&#x27;s return to prime-time television. The explanation given was that producers decided not to follow much of the original &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; series, as to give the film a fresh look. Even the show&#x27;s original opening credits with the theme &quot;Eyes of a Ranger&quot; performed by Chuck Norris, was absent from the TV movie.

Although the return of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; did not garner the ratings CBS had hoped for, indications were that CBS was green-lighting future &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; &quot;movie of the week&quot; projects. &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; ended with Sheree J. Wilson&#x27;s character the victim of a courthouse shooting, leading many viewers to believe that there would be a follow-up movie. However, when CBS announced their fall 2006 prime-time schedule, they said that they would no longer be producing &quot;Sunday Night Movie of the Week&quot; projects, which severely impaired any hopes of Walker&#x27;s return to television in the foreseeable future. On May 15, 2007, CBS announced its fall line-up, but this did not include the return of the &quot;Sunday Night Movie of the Week&quot;. In June 2018, cast members Clarence Gilyard and Sheree J. Wilson expressed interest in reprising their roles in a potential revival of the series, particularly to address the cliffhanger at the end of the post-series film.

===Spin-off===

Most episodes were based on true stories. A short-lived series, &quot;Sons of Thunder&quot;, featured recurring character Carlos Sandoval, who resigns from his post with the Dallas police and teams up with childhood friend Trent Malloy (a protégé of Walker&#x27;s), to start a private investigation firm.

===Reboot===

In September 2019, it was announced that a reboot of the series titled &quot;Walker&quot; was in development at CBS Television Studios from writer Anna Fricke, with Texas native Jared Padalecki attached to star. Fricke and Padalecki are also set to executive produce the project alongside Dan Lin and Lindsey Libertore from their production company Rideback, as well as Dan Spilo of Industry Entertainment. The CW, home of Padalecki&#x27;s long-running series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, emerged as a leading contender to air the series in addition to CBS, which aired the original series. Like the original, the reboot, in which Walker would get a female partner, will explore morality, family, and rediscovering our lost common ground. The logline reads:
In October, it was announced that &quot;Walker&quot; would air on The CW. On January 14, 2020, it was announced that The CW had issued the reboot with a series order.

In February 2020, it was announced that Lindsey Morgan, Keegan Allen, Mitch Pileggi, Molly Hagan and Coby Bell were cast as Micki, Walker&#x27;s female partner, Liam Walker, Walker&#x27;s younger brother, Bonham Walker, Walker&#x27;s father, Abeline Walker, Walker&#x27;s mother and Captain Larry James, a Texas Ranger Captain. In March 2020, Jeff Pierre, Violet Brinson and Kale Culley were cast as Trey Barnett, an Army medic and Micki&#x27;s boyfriend and Stella and August, Walker&#x27;s teenage kids.

It premiered on January 21, 2021.

A prequel series titled &quot;&quot; premiered on October 6, 2022.

===Novels===
Three &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; books, written by James Reasoner, were published by Berkley Publishing Group in 1999. The books are now out of print.
* &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (1998, )
* &quot;Hell&#x27;s Half Acre&quot; (1999, )
* &quot;Siege on the Belle&quot; (1999, )

===In other media===
The show has garnered a particular cult appreciation among Conan O&#x27;Brien fans, from one of his most popular segments called the &quot;Walker Texas Ranger Lever&quot;. He explained since NBC had recently purchased Universal, he could now show clips from &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; without having to pay any money. The joke was that he would pull a giant red lever, causing a random and comically awkward scene to play. Random scenes included Walker jumping out of a plane and punching a woman in the face, or being shot in the back while proposing, or Haley Joel Osment playing a boy who is first meeting the rest of Walker&#x27;s friends, and suddenly interjects &quot;Walker told me I have AIDS&quot;. Conan would go on to riff at the bizarre nature of the scene out of context. He did this primarily on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, which prompted the show&#x27;s star, Chuck Norris in character as Walker, to make a surprise guest appearance by acting out a skit in parody of the action scenes from &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

==Companies==
The series began with Cannon Television, but after Cannon folded, CBS assumed production responsibilities and is currently the full owner for this series. Other companies as listed below have also been involved with the series production and/or distribution.

<text>Jedburgh ( ; ; or ) is a town and former royal burgh in the Scottish Borders and the traditional county town of the historic county of Roxburghshire.

==History==
Jedburgh began as &quot;Jedworð&quot;, the &quot;worth&quot; or enclosed settlement on the Jed. Later the more familiar word &quot;burgh&quot; was substituted for this, though the original name survives as Jeddart/Jethart.

Bishop Ecgred of Lindisfarne founded a church at Jedburgh in the 9th century, and King David I of Scotland made it a priory between 1118 and 1138, housing Augustinian monks from Beauvais in France. The abbey was founded in 1147, but border wars with England in the 16th century left it a ruin.

The deeply religious Scottish king Malcolm IV died at Jedburgh in 1165, aged 24. His death is thought to have been caused by Paget&#x27;s disease of bone.

David I built a castle at Jedburgh, and in 1174 it was one of five fortresses ceded to England. It was an occasional royal residence for the Scots. It was demolished in 1409. 
In 1258, Jedburgh was a focus of royal attention, with negotiations between Scotland&#x27;s Alexander III and England&#x27;s Henry III over the succession to the Scottish throne, leaving the Comyn faction dominant. Alexander III was married to Yolande in the abbey in 1285.

In 1307, James Douglas, fighting for King Robert Bruce, took Jedburgh from the English with little effort.

Its proximity to England made it subject to raids and skirmishes by both Scottish and English forces but its strategic position also brought the town valuable trade. At various times and at various locations the town supported a horse market, a cattle market, a corn market and a butcher market. Farm workers and servants also attended hiring fairs seeking employment.

Jedburgh was burnt in September 1523 by an English force commanded by William Bulmer and Thomas Tempest. The Earl of Surrey reported the town had more houses than Berwick-upon-Tweed and six good towers. The horses stampeded from the English camp, some into the burning town. Such was the panic, Lord Dacre&#x27;s men said that the Devil was seen amongst them. During the war with England now known as the &quot;Rough Wooing&quot;, the Scots and their French allies made plans to fortify Jedburgh in 1549, with the advice of Camillo Marini, an Italian military engineer.

Mary, Queen of Scots, stayed at a certain house in the town in 1566 and that house is now a museum – Mary Queen of Scots House. Mary fell ill, and on 25 October 1566, the Privy council issued a &quot;Proclamation to keep good rule at Jedburgh&quot; during the time of her recuperation. No one should pursue their private quarrel and arm themselves, on pain of death for treason.

The title &quot;Lord of Jedburgh Forest&quot; was granted to George Douglas, 1st Earl of Angus on his marriage to the Princess Mary, daughter of Robert III in 1397. The titles of Archibald Douglas, 1st Duke of Douglas included &quot;Viscount Jedburgh Forest&quot;, but he died without an heir in 1761.

On 6 November 1745, the Jacobite army led by Prince Charles Edward Stuart passed through the town on its way to England. The Castle Prison opened in 1823.

In 1787, the geologist James Hutton noted what is now known as the Hutton Unconformity at Inchbonny, near Jedburgh. Layers of sedimentary rock which are tilted almost vertically are covered by newer horizontal layers of red sandstone. This was one of the findings that led him to develop his concept of an immensely long geologic time scale with &quot;no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.&quot;

The Scots name for the town is part of the expression &quot;Jeddart justice&quot; or &quot;Jethart Justice&quot;, in which a man was hanged first, and tried afterwards.
Jedburgh became the county town of Roxburghshire after the original county town of Roxburgh was abandoned following the destruction of Roxburgh Castle in 1460 during the Anglo-Scottish Wars. In 1812, County Buildings was built at the junction of Market Place and Castlegate in Jedburgh, serving as both a sheriff court and meeting place for the Commissioners of Supply. Roxburghshire County Council was created in 1890 and continued to meet at the County Buildings until 1930 when it moved its meetings to County Offices at Newtown St Boswells.

The town&#x27;s name was used for Operation Jedburgh, a clandestine operation by allied soldiers in occupied Europe during the Second World War.

== Geography ==

Jedburgh lies on the Jed Water, a tributary of the River Teviot. It is from the border with England, and is dominated by the substantial ruins of Jedburgh Abbey. Other notable buildings in the town include Queen Mary&#x27;s House, Jedburgh Castle Jail, now a museum, and the Jedburgh Library. 

Other places nearby are Ancrum, Bairnkine, Bonjedward, Camptown, Crailing, Edgerston, Ferniehirst Castle, Nisbet and Oxnam.

==Notable people==
Several notable people were born in the town, including Rev Dr Thomas Somerville&#x27;s niece, Mary Somerville, in 1780 (the eminent scientist and writer, after whom Somerville College, Oxford is named, and who appeared on the Royal Bank of Scotland £10 note from 2017).

James Thomson (1700–1748) who wrote &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, was born in Ednam, a village only twelve miles away, but he was educated in Jedburgh. David Brewster, physicist, mathematician, scientist, writer and inventor of the kaleidoscope, was born in Jedburgh in 1781. The popular preacher Rev. Robert Aitken (1800–1873) was born in Crailing near Jedburgh. General Sir Bindon Blood was born nearby in 1842. Alexander Jeffrey (F.S.A. Scot.) was a solicitor in the town and was also the county historian: he lived in Jedburgh until his death in 1874. The author and broadcaster Lavinia Derwent was born in a farmhouse a few miles outside Jedburgh in 1909. The Tinline brothers emigrated from Jedburgh in the late 1830s. George Tinline made a career in banking in Australia. John Tinline went to New Zealand and made his wealth in farming. John returned to Jedburgh later in life and gifted Allerley Well Park to his hometown.

The town&#x27;s well known rugby players are the scrum-halves, Roy Laidlaw, his nephew, Scotland rugby team captain Greig Laidlaw and Gary Armstrong. Douglas Young fought at Heavyweight at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

Emmy Award-winning journalist Nick Watt is from Jedburgh and hosted a short film about the town for the Travel Channel.

==The town today==
The abbey is maintained by Historic Environment Scotland and open to the public (there is an entry fee). Finds from excavations are displayed on site in the visitor centre attached to the Abbey ruins. The shell of the abbey, though much damaged over the years, is still largely complete.

Traditional festivals and performers include the annual Callant&#x27;s Festival, and Jedburgh Pipe Band and Jedforest Instrumental Band. Local delicacies include Jethart Snails (boiled sweets in the shape of a snail, said to originate from a recipe given to a local baker by a French prisoner, during the Napoleonic Wars) and Jethart pears. The fertile soil of Jedburgh makes it good for growing pear trees, and the pear trade was a thriving industry in Jedburgh for centuries.

An annual event is the &quot;Jethart Hand Ba&quot; game. 

The Canongate Brig dates from the 16th century. The nearby Capon Oak Tree is recognised to be of national interest and the 19th century Jedburgh Castle Jail and Newgate, with its spire, are among the town&#x27;s notable buildings.

Schooling currently takes place at Jedburgh Intergenerational Community Campus, which opened in early 2020.

== Transport ==
Although Jedburgh no longer has any rail access, it is well located on the road network. The A68 provides direct access to Edinburgh () and Newcastle-upon-Tyne (). Carlisle is away and Hawick, Kelso, Selkirk and Galashiels are all within .

Jedburgh is known to motorists from the Edinburgh and Newcastle-upon-Tyne areas as Jedburgh is signposted as a primary destination on the A68.

Bus services to Jedburgh are provided by Borders Buses. Until July 2013, they were mostly run by local operator Munro&#x27;s of Jedburgh.

== Sport ==
The town is home to a Rugby Club, Jed-Forest which was founded in 1885. Under-18 &quot;Semi Junior&quot; rugby is played by Jed Thistle at Lothian Park.

Football is represented by Jed Legion FC which currently plays in &#x27;A&#x27; League of the Border Amateur League. Ancrum AFC play in the village of Ancrum just to the north at Bridgend Park and are in the Border Amateur &#x27;B&#x27; League. A 1930s club, punningly named Jed Arts, won the East of Scotland League and the Border Cup in 1936–37.

Jedburgh has a golf club dating from 1892; the course has 18 holes.

<text>A text box also called an input box, text field or text entry box, is a control element of a graphical user interface, that should enable the user to input text information to be used by a program. Human Interface Guidelines recommend a single-line text box when only one line of input is required, and a multi-line text box only if more than one line of input may be required. Non-editable text boxes can serve the purpose of simply displaying text.

A typical text box is a rectangle of any size, possibly with a border that separates the text box from the rest of the interface. Text boxes may contain zero, one, or two scrollbars. Text boxes usually display a text cursor (commonly a blinking vertical line), indicating the current region of text being edited. It is common for the mouse cursor to change its shape when it hovers over a text box.

== Standard functionality ==
Typical implementations allow a user to do the following. (The keys indicated relate to the text box widgets in Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X; similar if not identical keyboard bindings exist under the X Window System and other systems, and typically follow the same scheme as Windows.)

===Enter text===

When keys are pressed on a keyboard, the text appears where the caret is. Some very simple text boxes may not show a caret, which would suggest that new characters typed in will appear at the end of the current text.

===Navigate and manipulate text===

Using a mouse:
* Change the caret position by clicking the desired point with a mouse cursor;
* Select a portion of text by pressing the main mouse button while pointing the cursor at one end of the desired part of the text and dragging the cursor to the other end while holding the button pressed.

Using the keyboard:
* Pressing arrow keys changes caret position by one character or line (in multiline text boxes);
* Pressing / keys (Microsoft&#x27;s Windows OS) or -left arrow / Command-right arrow (Apple&#x27;s Mac OS) moves the caret to the beginning / end of the line;
* Pressing / moves the caret a page (the number of lines that can be displayed in the text box at a time) backward / forward (Windows) or moves the scrollbar thumb a page backward / forward without changing the caret position (Mac OS);
* Holding the key (Windows) while pressing arrow keys or / keys makes the caret move at larger steps, e.g. words, paragraphs or beginning / end of document;
* Holding the (Mac OS) while pressing arrows moves the caret whole words or paragraphs;
* Holding the while pressing up or down arrows (Mac OS) or Holding the key while pressing / (Windows) moves the caret to the beginning or end of the document;
* Holding the while changing the caret position with a mouse or keyboard selects the text between the caret position from when shift was first pressed and its current position.
* Pressing (Windows) selects all text.

===Edit text===
Work in insert or overwrite mode, typically switched using . In insert mode if there is a character to the right of the caret, the new character will be inserted before it, while in overwrite mode typing a new character will replace (overwrite) the character to the right of the caret position.

Typing in a text while some part of the text already entered is selected will replace the selected text.

 / keys remove one character right / left of current caret position, while pressing them together with the or removes one word.

Edit the text using standard clipboard operations.

Edits can be undone and redone with  /  (Windows) or / (Mac OS)

<text>A category mistake (or category error, categorical mistake, or mistake of category) is a semantic or ontological error in which things belonging to a particular category are presented as if they belong to a different category, or, alternatively, a property is ascribed to a thing that could not possibly have that property. An example is a person learning that the game of cricket involves team spirit, and after being given a demonstration of each player&#x27;s role, asking which player performs the &quot;team spirit&quot;.

==History==
Al Martinich claims that the philosopher Thomas Hobbes was the first to discuss a propensity among philosophers mistakenly to combine words taken from different and incompatible categories.

The term &quot;category-mistake&quot; was introduced by Gilbert Ryle in his book &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; (1949) to remove what he argued to be a confusion over the nature of mind born from Cartesian metaphysics. Ryle argues that it is a mistake to treat the mind as an object made of an immaterial substance because predications of substance are not meaningful for a collection of dispositions and capacities.

The phrase is introduced in the first chapter. The first example is of a visitor to Oxford. The visitor, upon viewing the colleges and library, reportedly inquires, &quot;But where is the University?&quot; The visitor&#x27;s mistake is presuming that a University is part of the category &quot;units of physical infrastructure&quot;, rather than that of an &quot;institution&quot;. In his second example, a child witnesses the march-past of a division of soldiers. After having had battalions, batteries, squadrons, etc. pointed out, the child asks when the division is going to appear. He is told that &quot;the march-past was not a parade of battalions, batteries, squadrons &quot;and&quot; a division; it was a parade of the battalions, batteries and squadrons &quot;of&quot; a division&quot; (Ryle&#x27;s italics). His third example is of a foreigner being shown a cricket match. After being pointed out batsmen, bowlers and fielders, the foreigner asks: &quot;who is left to contribute the famous element of team-spirit?&quot; He goes on to argue that the Cartesian dualism of mind and body rests on a category mistake.

==Application==
Massimo Pigliucci, Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New York, argues that the &quot;hard problem of consciousness&quot;, as expressed by David Chalmers and others, rests on a category mistake, in that explaining &quot;experience&quot; is being incorrectly treated as different from explaining the underlying biological processes which generate experience.
