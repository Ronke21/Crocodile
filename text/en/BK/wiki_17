<text>was a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Homma commanded the Japanese 14th Army, which invaded the Philippines and perpetrated the Bataan Death March. After the war, Homma was convicted of war crimes relating to the actions of troops under his direct command and executed by firing squad on April 3, 1946.

==Biography==
Homma was born on Sado Island, in the Sea of Japan off Niigata Prefecture. He graduated in the 14th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1907, and in the 27th class of the Army Staff College in 1915.

Homma had a deep respect for, and some understanding of, the West, having spent eight years as a military attaché in the United Kingdom. In 1917, he was attached to the East Lancashire Regiment, and in 1918, served with the British Expeditionary Force in France, being awarded the Military Cross.

From 1930 to 1932, Homma was again sent as a military attaché to the United Kingdom, where his proficiency in the English language was useful. He was also assigned to be part of the Japanese delegation to the Geneva Disarmament Conference in 1932 and served with the press section of the Army Ministry from 1932 to 1933. He was given a field command again, as commander of the IJA 1st Infantry Regiment from 1933 to 1935, and was promoted to command the IJA 32nd Infantry Brigade from 1935 to 1936.

In 1937, Homma was appointed aide-de-camp to Prince Chichibu, a brother of the Emperor. With him, he made a diplomatic tour in Western Europe, attending the coronation of King George VI. The visit continued to Germany where he attended the Nuremberg rally and met Adolf Hitler, with whom the prince tried to boost relations, following the Anti-Comintern Pact of 1936. He then served as the commander of the Taiwan Army of the Imperial Armed Forces, and composed the lyric of the military song &quot;Taiwan Army&quot;. Yamaguchi Yoshiko (&quot;Lee Shiang Lan&quot; in Chinese) was invited to sing the song to boost Taiwanese morale.

He was promoted to lieutenant general in July 1938.

With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Homma was appointed commander of the IJA 27th Division in China from 1938 to 1940 and directed the blockade of the foreign concessions in Tientsin, where he led the negotiations with the British. After the fall of Nanjing, he declared publicly that &quot;unless peace is achieved immediately it will be disastrous&quot;. Homma was removed from his position at the front lines, and reassigned to become commander in chief of the Taiwan Army District from 1940 to 1941.

==The Philippines==

With the start of the Pacific War, Homma was named commander of the 43,110-man IJA 14th Army and tasked with the invasion of the Philippines. He ordered his troops to treat the Filipinos not as enemies but as friends, and respect their customs and religion. In one instance, on his approach to Manila, Homma stopped his columns and ordered the men to clean up and tighten formations, believing that unkempt soldiers are more likely to loot and rape.

His approach towards Filipino civilians earned him the enmity of his superior, General Count Hisaichi Terauchi, commander of the Southern Army, who sent adverse reports about Homma to Tokyo from his headquarters in Saigon. Also, subversion was growing within Homma&#x27;s command by a small group of insubordinates, under the influence of Colonel Masanobu Tsuji. In Homma&#x27;s name, they sent out secret orders against his policies, including ordering the execution of Filipino Chief Justice José Abad Santos and attempted execution of former Speaker of the House of Representatives Manuel Roxas, which Homma found out about in time to stop.

Homma failed to give credence to the possibility that a retreat into the Bataan Peninsula by Filipino-American forces might succeed in upsetting the Japanese timetable. By the time he recognized his mistake, his best infantry division had been replaced by a poorly trained reserve brigade, greatly weakening his assault force. Rather than waste his men in furious frontal assaults, he tried to outmaneuver the American forces. This brought criticism from superiors, who believed he had been &quot;contaminated&quot; by Western ideas about conserving the lives of his men.

Worried about the stalled offensive in Luzon, Hirohito pressed Army Chief of Staff Hajime Sugiyama twice in January 1942 to increase troop strength and launch a quick knockout on Bataan. Following these orders, Sugiyama put pressure on Homma to renew his attacks. The resulting Battle of Bataan, commencing in January 1942, was one of the most intense in the campaign. Following Japanese victory in April, at least 60,000 Allied prisoners of war were marched 60 miles (100 km) to a prisoner-of-war camp. Due to ill treatment and abuse from Japanese soldiers, at least 5,500 Allied soldiers died during the march. Homma became known as the Beast of Bataan among Allied soldiers.

Despite Japanese victory in the Battle of Bataan, the deteriorating relationship between Homma and Sugiyama led to the removal of Homma from command shortly after the fall of Corregidor, and he was thereafter commander of the 14th Army in name only. The &quot;New York Times&quot; erroneously reported prior to the fall of Bataan that Homma was replaced by General Yamashita, and that Homma had committed suicide.

The Imperial General Headquarters regarded Homma as not aggressive enough in war (resulting in the high cost and long delay in securing the American and Filipino forces&#x27; surrender), and too lenient with the Filipino people in peace, and he was subsequently forced into retirement in August 1943. Homma retired from the military and lived in semiseclusion in Japan until the end of the war.

==War crimes trial and execution==

After the surrender of Japan, in mid-September 1945, the American occupation authorities arrested Homma and extradited him to the Philippines, where he was tried by an American tribunal on 48 counts of violating international rules of war relating to the atrocities committed by troops under his command during the Bataan Death March.

Homma was arraigned on December 19, 1945, and the trial was held at the High Commissioner&#x27;s Residence, Manila, between January 3 and February 11, 1946. A team of six lawyers, none of whom had experience in criminal law, was appointed to defend Homma.

The prosecution called witnesses and filed depositions attesting to the abuse and poor conditions encountered by the Allied soldiers during the march. In particular, James Baldassarre, a survivor of the march, testified to the killings of two Allied officers by the Japanese, and Homma&#x27;s indifference to the illness and suffering of the Allied prisoners of war.

During his defense, Homma claimed that he was so preoccupied with the plans for the Corregidor assault that he had forgotten about the prisoners&#x27; treatment, believing that his officers were properly handling the matter. He claimed that he did not learn of the atrocity until after the war, though his headquarters were only from the route of the march, stating in court, &quot;I came to know for the first time in the court of [the] atrocities, and I am ashamed of myself should these atrocities have happened.&quot; Robert Pelz, a member of Homma&#x27;s defense team, noted in his diary, &quot;I truly believe [Homma] had no idea of the things that occurred.&quot;

While it is unclear, according to historian Kevin C. Murphy, whether Homma ordered the atrocities that occurred during the march, his lack of administrative expertise, and his inability to adequately delegate authority and control his men, helped to enable the atrocities. After American–Filipino forces surrendered the Bataan Peninsula, Homma turned the logistics of handling the estimated 25,000 prisoners to Major General Yoshitake Kawane. Homma publicly stated that the POWs would be treated fairly. A plan was formulated, approved by Homma, to transport and march the prisoners to Camp O&#x27;Donnell. However, the plan was severely flawed, as the American and Filipino POWs were starving, were weak with malaria, and numbered not 25,000 but 76,000 men, far more than any Japanese plan had anticipated.

On February 11, 1946, Homma was convicted of all counts and sentenced &quot;to be shot to death with musketry&quot;, which is considered to be more honorable than a sentence of death by hanging. Homma&#x27;s wife visited Douglas MacArthur to urge a careful review of her husband&#x27;s case. MacArthur affirmed the tribunal&#x27;s sentence, and Homma was executed by firing squad by American forces on April 3, 1946, in Los Baños, Laguna, a few kilometers from the former internment camp at the University of the Philippines Los Baños.

==Trial controversy==
Various claims and charges have been lodged that Homma&#x27;s trial was unfair or biased and that his trial and execution served primarily to avenge Homma&#x27;s defeat of General MacArthur&#x27;s forces. Associate Justice Frank Murphy, in dissent of denial of a hearing by the U.S. Supreme Court on a rule of evidence, stated,

Either we conduct such a trial as this in the noble spirit and atmosphere of our Constitution or we abandon all pretense to justice, let the ages slip away, and descend to the level of revengeful blood purges.

Homma&#x27;s chief defense counsel, John H. Skeen Jr., stated that it was a &quot;highly irregular trial, conducted in an atmosphere that left no doubt as to what the ultimate outcome would be&quot;.

General Arthur Trudeau, a member of the five-member tribunal that condemned Homma, said in a 1971 interview,There&#x27;s no question but that some men who were either weak or wounded were shot or bayoneted on this Death March. The question is how many echelons of command up is a person responsible to the point where you should condemn him for murder or crime, and that is what General Homma was accused of ... We need to cogitate about our wisdom in condemning General Homma to death. I must admit I was not much in favor of it. In fact, I opposed it but I could only oppose it to a point that allowed him to be shot as a soldier and not hanged ... I thought he was an outstanding soldier.General Douglas MacArthur had a differing conclusion and wrote in his review of the case:

If this defendant does not deserve his judicial fate, none in jurisdictional history ever did. There can be no greater, more heinous, or more dangerous crime than the mass destruction, under guise of military authority or military necessity, of helpless men incapable of further contribution to war effort. A failure of law process to punish such acts of criminal enormity would threaten the very fabric of world society.

<doc id="377373" wikidata="Q11696332" url="?curid=377373" title="Egypt in the Middle Ages">
<text>Following the Islamic conquest in 641-642, Lower Egypt was ruled at first by governors acting in the name of the Rashidun Caliphs and then the Umayyad Caliphs in Damascus, but in 750 the Umayyads were overthrown. Throughout Islamic rule, Askar was named the capital and housed the ruling administration. The conquest led to two separate provinces all under one ruler: Upper and Lower Egypt. These two very distinct regions were governed by the military and followed the demands handed down by the governor of Egypt and imposed by the heads of their communities.

Egypt was ruled by many dynasties from the start of Islamic control in 639 until the early 16th century. The Umayyad period lasted from 658 to 750. The Abbasid period which came after was much more focused on taxes and centralizing power. In 868, the Tulunids, ruled by Ahmad ibn Tulun, expanded Egypt&#x27;s territory into the Levant. He would rule until his death in 884. After years of turmoil under Ahmad ibn Tulun&#x27;s successor, many citizens defected back to the Abbasids and in 904 they would reclaim power from the Tulunids. In 969, Egypt came under the control of the Fatimids. This dynasty would begin to fade after the death of their last ruler in 1171.

In 1174, Egypt came under the rule of the Ayyubids, who ruled from Damascus and not from Cairo. This dynasty fought against the Crusader States during the Fifth Crusade. Ayyubid Sultan Najm al-Din recaptured Jerusalem in 1244. He introduced Mamluk forces into his army in order to hold off the crusaders. This decision would be one he regretted. The Ayyubids were overthrown by their bodyguards, known as the Mamluks in 1252 and ruled until 1517, when Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire under the Eyālet-i Mıṣr province.

==Early Islamic period==

===Muslim conquest of Egypt===
In 639 an army of some 4,000 men were sent against Egypt by the second caliph, Umar, under the command of Amr ibn al-As. This army was joined by another 5,000 men in 640 and defeated a Byzantine army at the battle of Heliopolis. Amr next proceeded in the direction of Alexandria, which was surrendered to him by a treaty signed on November 8, 641. Alexandria was regained for the Byzantine Empire in 645 but was retaken by Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by Constans II was repulsed. From that time no serious effort was made by the Byzantines to regain possession of the country.

===Administration of early Islamic Egypt===
Following the first surrender of Alexandria, Amr chose a new site to settle his men, near the location of the Byzantine fortress of Babylon. The new settlement received the name of Fustat, after Amr&#x27;s tent, which had been pitched there when the Arabs besieged the fortress. Fustat quickly became the focal point of Islamic Egypt, and, with the exception of the brief relocation to Helwan during a plague in 689, and the period of 750–763, when the seat of the governor moved to Askar, the capital and residence of the administration. After the conquest, the country was initially divided in two provinces, Upper Egypt (&quot;al-sa&#x27;id&quot;) and Lower Egypt with the Nile Delta (&quot;asfal al-ard&quot;). In 643/4, however, Caliph Uthman appointed a single governor (&quot;wāli&quot;) with jurisdiction over all of Egypt, resident at Fustat. The governor would in turn nominate deputies for Upper and Lower Egypt. Alexandria remained a distinct district, reflecting both its role as the country&#x27;s shield against Byzantine attacks, and as the major naval base. It was considered a frontier fortress (&quot;ribat&quot;) under a military governor and was heavily garrisoned, with a quarter of the province&#x27;s garrison serving there in semi-annual rotation. Next to the &quot;wāli&quot;, there was also the commander of the police (&quot;ṣāḥib al-shurṭa&quot;), responsible for internal security and for commanding the &quot;jund&quot; (army).

The main pillar of the early Muslim rule and control in the country was the military force, or &quot;jund&quot;, staffed by the Arab settlers. These were initially the men who had followed Amr and participated in the conquest. The followers of Amr were mostly drawn from Yamani (south Arabian) tribes, rather than the northern Arab (Qays i) tribes, who were scarcely represented in the province; it was they who dominated the country&#x27;s affairs for the first two centuries of Muslim rule. Initially, they numbered 15,500, but their numbers grew through emigration in the subsequent decades. By the time of Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya I (r. 661–680), the number of men registered in the army list (&quot;diwān al-jund&quot;) and entitled an annual pay (&quot;ʿaṭāʾ&quot;) reached 40,000. Jealous of their privileges and status, which entitled them to a share of the local revenue, the members of the &quot;jund&quot; then virtually closed off the register to new entries. It was only after the losses of the Second Fitna that the registers were updated, and occasionally, governors would add soldiers &quot;en masse&quot; to the lists as a means to garner political support.

In return for a very small tribute of money (0.5% Jizya Tax on some free men) and food for the troops, the Christian inhabitants of Egypt were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs.

Conversions of Copts to Islam were initially rare, and the old system of taxation was maintained for the greater part of the first Islamic century. The old division of the country into districts (&quot;nomoi&quot;) was maintained, and to the inhabitants of these districts demands were directly addressed by the governor of Egypt, while the head of the community—ordinarily a Copt but in some cases a Muslim Egyptian—was responsible for compliance with the demand.

===Umayyad period===
During the First Fitna, Caliph Ali (r. 656–661) appointed Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr as governor of Egypt, but Amr led an invasion in summer 658 that defeated Ibn Abi Bakr and secured the country for the Umayyads. Amr then served as governor until his death in 664. From 667/8 until 682, the province was governed by another fervent pro-Umayyad partisan, Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari. During the Second Fitna, Ibn al-Zubayr gained the support of the Kharijites in Egypt and sent a governor of his own, Abd al-Rahman ibn Utba al-Fihri, to the province. The Kharijite-backed Zubayrid regime was very unpopular with the local Arabs, who called upon the Umayyad caliph Marwan I (r. 684–685) for aid. In December 684, Marwan invaded Egypt and reconquered it with relative ease. Marwan installed his son Abd al-Aziz as governor. Relying on his close ties with the &quot;jund&quot;, Abd al-Aziz ruled the country for 20 years, enjoying wide autonomy and governing as a &quot;de facto&quot; viceroy. Abd al-Aziz also supervised the completion of the Muslim conquest of North Africa; it was he who appointed Musa ibn Nusayr in his post as governor of Ifriqiya. Abd al-Aziz hoped to be succeeded by his son, but when he died, Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (685–695) sent his own son, Abdallah, as governor in a move to reassert control and prevent the country from becoming a hereditary domain.

Abd al-Malik ibn Rifa&#x27;a al-Fahmi in 715 and his successor Ayyub ibn Sharhabil in 717 were the first governors chosen from the &quot;jund&quot;, rather than members of the Umayyad family or court. Both are reported to have increased pressure on the Copts, and initiated measures of Islamization. The resentment of the Copts against taxation led to a revolt in 725. In 727, to strengthen Arab representation, a colony of 3,000 Arabs was set up near Bilbeis. Meanwhile, the employment of the Arabic language had been steadily gaining ground, and in 706 it was made the official language of the government. Egyptian Arabic, the modern Arabic accent and dialect of Egypt, began to form. Other revolts of the Copts are recorded for the years 739 and 750, the last year of Umayyad domination. The outbreaks in all cases are attributed to increased taxation.

===Abbasid period===
The Abbasid period was marked by new taxations, and the Copts revolted again in the fourth year of Abbasid rule. At the beginning of the 9th century the practice of ruling Egypt through a governor was resumed under Abdallah ibn Tahir, who decided to reside at Baghdad, sending a deputy to Egypt to govern for him. In 828 another Egyptian revolt broke out, and in 831 the Copts joined with native Muslims against the government.

A major change came in 834, when Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim discontinued the practice of paying the &quot;jund&quot; as they nominally still formed the province&#x27;s garrison—the &quot;ʿaṭāʾ&quot; from the local revenue. Al-Mu&#x27;tasim discontinued the practice, removing the Arab families from the army registers &quot;diwān&quot; and ordering that the revenues of Egypt be sent to the central government, which would then pay the &quot;ʿaṭāʾ&quot; only to the Turkish troops stationed in the province. This was a move towards centralizing power in the hands of the central caliphal administration, but also signalled the decline of the old elites, and the passing of power to the officials sent to the province by the Abbasid court, most notably the Turkish soldiers favoured by al-Mu&#x27;tasim. At about the same time, for the first time the Muslim population began surpassing the Coptic Christians in numbers, and throughout the 9th century the rural districts were increasingly subject to both Arabization and Islamization. The rapidity of this process, and the influx of settlers after the discovery of gold and emerald mines at Aswan, meant that Upper Egypt in particular was only superficially controlled by the local governor. Furthermore, the persistence of internecine strife and turmoil at the heart of the Abbasid state—the so-called &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;—led to the appearance of millennialist revolutionary movements in the province under a series of Alid pretenders in the 870s. In part, these movements were an expression of dissatisfaction with and alienation from imperial rule by Baghdad; these sentiments would manifest themselves in the support of many Egyptians for the Fatimids in the 10th century.

===Tulunid period===

In 868, Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tazz (r. 866–869) gave charge of Egypt to the Turkish general Bakbak. Bakbak in turn sent his stepson Ahmad ibn Tulun as his lieutenant and resident governor. This appointment ushered in a new era in Egypt&#x27;s history: hitherto a passive province of an empire, under Ibn Tulun it would re-emerge as an independent political centre. Ibn Tulun would use the country&#x27;s wealth to extend his rule into the Levant, in a pattern followed by later Egypt-based regimes, from the Ikhshidids to the Mamluk Sultanate. 

The first years of Ibn Tulun&#x27;s governorship were dominated by his power struggle with the powerful head of the fiscal administration, the Ibn al-Mudabbir. The latter had been appointed as fiscal agent (&quot;ʿāmil&quot;) already since , and had rapidly become the most hated man in the country as he doubled the taxes and imposed new ones on Muslims and non-Muslims alike. By 872 Ibn Tulun had achieved Ibn al-Mudabirbir&#x27;s dismissal and taken over the management of the fisc himself, and had managed to assemble an army of his own, thereby becoming &quot;de facto&quot; independent of Baghdad. As a sign of his power, he established a new palace city to the northeast of Fustat, called al-Qata&#x27;i, in 870. The project was a conscious emulation of, and rival to, the Abbasid capital Samarra, with quarters assigned to the regiments of his army, a hippodrome, hospital, and palaces. The new city&#x27;s centrepiece was the Mosque of Ibn Tulun. Ibn Tulun continued to emulate the familiar Samarra model in the establishment of his administration as well, creating new departments and entrusting them to Samarra-trained officials. His regime was in many ways typical of the &quot;&quot;ghulām&quot; system&quot; that became one of the two main paradigms of Islamic polities in the 9th and 10th centuries, as the Abbasid Caliphate fragmented and new dynasties emerged. These regimes were based on the power of a regular army composed of slave soldiers or &quot;ghilmān&quot;, but in turn, according to Hugh N. Kennedy, &quot;the paying of the troops was the major preoccupation of government&quot;. It is therefore in the context of the increased financial requirements that in 879, the supervision of the finances passed to Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Madhara&#x27;i, the founder of the al-Madhara&#x27;i bureaucratic dynasty that dominated the fiscal apparatus of Egypt for the next 70 years. The peace and security provided by the Tulunid regime, the establishment of an efficient administration, and repairs and expansions to the irrigation system, coupled with a consistently high level of Nile floods, resulted in a major increase in revenue. By the end of his reign, Ibn Tulun had accumulated a reserve of ten million dinars.

Ibn Tulun&#x27;s rise was facilitated by the feebleness of the Abbasid government, threatened by the rise of the Saffarids in the east and by the Zanj Rebellion in Iraq itself, and divided due to the rivalry between Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tamid (r. 870–892) and his increasingly powerful brother and &quot;de facto&quot; regent, al-Muwaffaq. Open conflict between Ibn Tulun and al-Muwaffaq broke out in 875/6. The latter tried to oust Ibn Tulun from Egypt, but the expedition sent against him barely reached Syria. In retaliation, with the support of the Caliph, in 877/8 Ibn Tulun received responsibility for the entirety of Syria and the frontier districts of Cilicia (the &quot;Thughūr&quot;). Ibn Tulun occupied Syria but failed to seize Tarsus in Cilicia, and was forced to return to Egypt due to the abortive revolt of his eldest son, Abbas. Ibn Tulun has Abbas imprisoned, and named his second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir. In 882, Ibn Tulun came close to having Egypt become the new centre of the Caliphate, when al-Mu&#x27;tamid tried to flee to his domains. In the event, however, the Caliph was overtaken and brought him back to Samarra (February 883) and under his brother&#x27;s control. This opened anew the rift between the two rulers: Ibn Tulun organized an assembly of religious jurists at Damascus which denounced al-Muwaffaq a usurper, condemned his maltreatment of the Caliph, declared his place in the succession as void, and called for a &quot;jihād&quot; against him. Al-Muwaffaq was duly denounced in sermons in the mosques across the Tulunid domains, while the Abbasid regent responded in kind with a ritual denunciation of Ibn Tulun. Ibn Tulun then tried once more, again without success, to impose his rule over Tarsus. He fell ill on his return journey to Egypt, and died at Fustat on 10 May 884. 
At Ibn Tulun&#x27;s death, Khumarawayh, with the backing of the Tulunid elites, succeeded without opposition. Ibn Tulun bequeathed his heir &quot;with a seasoned military, a stable economy, and a coterie of experienced commanders and bureaucrats&quot;. Khumarawayh was able to preserve his authority against the Abbasid&#x27;s attempt to overthrow him at the Battle of Tawahin and even made additional territorial gains, recognized in a treaty with al-Muwaffaq in 886 that gave the Tulunids the hereditary governorship over Egypt and Syria for 30 years. The accession of al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s son al-Mu&#x27;tadid as Caliph in 892 marked a new rapprochement, culminating in the marriage of Khumarawayh&#x27;s daughter to the new Caliph, but also the return of the provinces of Diyar Rabi&#x27;a and Diyar Mudar to caliphal control. Domestically, Khumarawayh&#x27;s reign was one of &quot;luxury and decay&quot; (Hugh N. Kennedy), but also a time of relative tranquility in Egypt as well as in Syria, a rather unusual occurrence for the period. Nevertheless, Khumarawayh&#x27;s extravagant spending exhausted the fisc, and by the time of his assassination in 896, the Tulunid treasury was empty. Following Khumarawayh&#x27;s death, internal strife sapped Tulunid power. Khumarawayh&#x27;s son Jaysh was a drunkard who executed his uncle, Mudar ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun; he was deposed after only a few months and replaced by his brother Harun ibn Khumarawayh. Harun too was a weak ruler, and although a revolt by his uncle Rabi&#x27;ah in Alexandria was suppressed, the Tulunids were unable to confront the attacks of the Qarmatians who began at the same time. In addition, many commanders defected to the Abbasids, whose power revived under the capable leadership of al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s son, Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid (r. 892–902). Finally, in December 904, two other sons of Ibn Tulun, Ali and Shayban, murdered their nephew and assumed control of the Tulunid state. Far from halting the decline, this event alienated key commanders in Syria and led to the rapid and relatively unopposed reconquest of Syria and Egypt by the Abbasids under Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib, who entered Fustat in January 905. With the exception of the Great Mosque of Ibn Tulun, the victorious Abbasid troops pillaged al-Qata&#x27;i and razed it to the ground.

===Second Abbasid period and Ikhshidid period===
The Abbasids were able to repulse Fatimid invasions of Egypt in 914–915 and 919–921.

In 935, after repulsing another Fatimid attack, the Turkish commander Muhammad ibn Tughj became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Egypt with the title of &quot;al-Ikhshid&quot;. After his death in 946, the succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due to the influence of the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning a new era in the country&#x27;s history.

==Fatimid period==

Jawhar as-Siqilli immediately began the building of a new city, Cairo, to furnish quarters for the army which he had brought. A palace for the Caliph and a mosque for the army were immediately constructed, which for many centuries remained the centre of Muslim learning. However, the Carmathians of Damascus under Hasan al-Asam advanced through Palestine to Egypt, and in the autumn of 971 Jauhar found himself besieged in his new city. By a timely sortie, preceded by the administration of bribes to various officers in the Carmathian host, Jauhar succeeded in inflicting a severe defeat on the besiegers, who were compelled to evacuate Egypt and part of Syria.

Meanwhile, the caliph in 2 al-Muizz had been summoned to enter the palace that had been prepared for him, and after leaving a viceroy to take charge of his western possessions he arrived in Alexandria on May 31 973, and proceeded to instruct his new subjects in the particular form of religion (Shiism) which his family represented. As this was in origin identical with that professed by the Carmathians, he hoped to gain the submission of their leader by argument; but this plan was unsuccessful, and there was a fresh invasion from that quarter in the year after his arrival, and the caliph found himself besieged in his capital.

The Carmathians were gradually forced to retreat from Egypt and then from Syria by some successful engagements, and by the judicious use of bribes, whereby dissension was sown among their leaders. Al-Muizz also found time to take some active measures against the Byzantines, with whom his generals fought in Syria with varying fortune. Before his death he was acknowledged as Caliph in Mecca and Medina, as well as Syria, Egypt and North Africa as far as Tangier.

Under the vizier al-Aziz, there was a large amount of toleration conceded to the other sects of Islam, and to other communities, but the belief that the Christians of Egypt were in league with the Byzantine emperor, and even burned a fleet which was being built for the Byzantine war, led to some persecution. Al-Aziz attempted without success to enter into friendly relations with the Buwayhid ruler of Baghdad, and tried to gain possession of Aleppo, as the key to Iraq, but this was prevented by the intervention of the Byzantines. His North African possessions were maintained and extended, but the recognition of the Fatimid caliph in this region was little more than nominal.
His successor al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah came to the throne at the age of eleven, being the son of Aziz by a Christian mother. His conduct of affairs was vigorous and successful, and he concluded a peace with the Byzantine emperor. He is perhaps best remembered by his destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (1009), a measure which helped to provoke the Crusades, but was only part of a general scheme for converting all Christians and Jews in his dominions to his own opinions by force.

A more reputable expedient with the same end in view was the construction of a great library in Cairo, with ample provision for students; this was modelled on a similar institution at Baghdad. For unknown reasons al-Hakim disappeared in 1021.

In 1049 the Zirid dynasty in the Maghrib returned to the Sunni faith and became subjects of the Caliphate in Baghdad, but at the same time Yemen recognized the Fatimid caliphate. Meanwhile, Baghdad was taken by the Turks, falling to the Seljuk Tughrul Beg in 1059. The Turks also plundered Cairo in 1068, but they were driven out by 1074. During this time, however, Syria was overrun by an invader in league with the Seljuk Malik Shah, and Damascus was permanently lost to the Fatimids. This period is otherwise memorable for the rise of the Hashshashin, or Assassins.

During the Crusades, al-Mustafa maintained himself in Alexandria, and helped the Crusaders by rescuing Jerusalem from the Ortokids, thereby facilitating its conquest by the Crusaders in 1099. He endeavoured to retrieve his error by himself advancing into Palestine, but he was defeated at the battle of Ascalon, and compelled to retire to Egypt. Many of the Palestinian possessions of the Fatimids then successively fell into the hands of the Crusaders.

In 1118 Egypt was invaded by Baldwin I of Jerusalem, who burned the gates and the mosques of Farama, and advanced to Tinnis, when illness compelled him to retreat. In August 1121 al-Afdal Shahanshah was assassinated in a street of Cairo, it is said, with the connivance of the Caliph, who immediately began the plunder of his house, where fabulous treasures were said to be amassed. The vizier&#x27;s offices were given to al-Mamn. His external policy was not more fortunate than that of his predecessor, as he lost Tyre to the Crusaders, and a fleet equipped by him was defeated by the Venetians.

In 1153 Ascalon was lost, the last place in Syria which the Fatimids held; its loss was attributed to dissensions between the parties of which the garrison consisted. In April 1154 the Caliph al-Zafir was murdered by his vizier Abbas, according to Usamah, because the Caliph had suggested to his favorite, the vizier&#x27;s son, to murder his father; and this was followed by a massacre of the brothers of Zafir, followed by the raising of his infant son Abul-Qasim Isa to the throne.

In December 1162, the vizier Shawar took control of Cairo. However, after only nine months he was compelled to flee to Damascus, where he was favorably received by the prince Nureddin, who sent with him to Cairo a force of Kurds under Asad al-din Shirkuh. At the same time Egypt was invaded by the Franks, who raided and did much damage on the coast. Shawar recaptured Cairo but a dispute then arose with his Syrian allies for the possession of Egypt. Shawar, being unable to cope with the Syrians, demanded help of the Frankish king of Jerusalem Amalric I, who hastened to his aid with a large force, which united with Shawar&#x27;s and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis for three months; at the end of this time, owing to the successes of Nureddin in Syria, the Franks granted Shirkuh a free passage with his troops back to Syria, on condition of Egypt being evacuated (October 1164).

Two years later Shirkuh, a Kurdish general known as &quot;the Lion&quot;, persuaded Nureddin to put him at the head of another expedition to Egypt, which left Syria in January 1167; a Frankish army hastened to Shawar&#x27;s aid. At the battle of Babain (April 11, 1167) the allies were defeated by the forces commanded by Shirkuh and his nephew Saladin, who was made prefect of Alexandria, which surrendered to Shirkuh without a struggle. In 1168 Amalric invaded again, but Shirkuh&#x27;s return caused the Crusaders to withdraw.

Shirkuh was appointed vizier but died of indigestion (March 23, 1169), and the Caliph appointed Saladin as successor to Shirkuh; the new vizier professed to hold office as a deputy of Nureddin, whose name was mentioned in public worship after that of the Caliph. Nureddin loyally aided his deputy in dealing with Crusader invasions of Egypt, and he ordered Saladin to substitute the name of the Abbasid caliph for the Fatimid in public worship. The last Fatimid caliph died soon after in September, 1171.

==Ayyubid period==

Saladin, a general known as &quot;the Lion&quot;, was confirmed as Nureddin&#x27;s deputy in Egypt, and on the death of Nureddin on April 12, 1174, he took the title sultan. During his reign Damascus, rather than Cairo, was the major city of the empire. Nevertheless, he fortified Cairo, which became the political centre of Egypt. It was in 1183 that Saladin&#x27;s rule over Egypt and North Syria was consolidated. Much of Saladin&#x27;s time was spent in Syria, where he fought the Crusader States, and Egypt was largely governed by his deputy Karaksh.

Saladin&#x27;s son Othman succeeded him in Egypt in 1193. He allied with his uncle (Saladin&#x27;s brother) Al-Adil I against Saladin&#x27;s other sons, and after the wars that followed, Al-Adil took power in 1200. He died in 1218 during the siege of Damietta in the Fifth Crusade, and was succeeded by Al-Kamil, who lost Damietta to the Crusaders in 1219. However, he defeated their advance to Cairo by flooding the Nile, and they were forced to evacuate Egypt in 1221. Al-Kamil was later forced to give up various cities in Palestina and Syria to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor during the Sixth Crusade, in order to gain his help against Damascus.

Najm al-Din became sultan in 1240. His reign saw the recapture of Jerusalem in 1244, and the introduction of a larger force of Mameluks into the army. Much of his time was spent in campaigns in Syria, where he allied with the Khwarezmians against the Crusaders and Ayyubids. In 1249 he faced an invasion by Louis IX of France (the Seventh Crusade), and Damietta was lost again. Najm al-Din died soon after this, but his son Turanshah defeated Louis and expelled the Crusaders from Egypt. Turanshah was soon overthrown by the Mameluks, who had become the &quot;kingmakers&quot; since their arrival and now wanted full power for themselves.

==Mamluk Egypt==
The Mamluk&#x27;s violent approach to power brought them great political and economic prosperity and led them to becoming the rulers of Egypt. The Mamluk Egypt period began with the Bahri Dynasty and was followed by the Burji Dynasty. The Bahri Dynasty would rule from 1250 to 1382, while the Burji dynasty would last from 1382 to 1517.

Cultural contributions of the Mamluk Empire spanned across more than religion. Literature and astronomy were two subjects which the Mamluks valued and participated in heavily. They were a highly literate and educated society. Private libraries were a status symbol in Mamluk culture. Some of the libraries discovered show evidence of the remnants of thousands of books.

The end of the period was brought about due to famine, military tensions, disease, and high taxation.

===Bahri dynasty===


The Mamluk sultans were drawn from the freed slaves who formed the court and went on to become slaveowners themselves, they went on to office the army. The sultans were unable to effectively form a new dynasty, usually leaving behind infants who were then overthrown. The Bahri dynasty (1250–1382) would go through 25 sultans in its 132-year period. Many died or were killed shortly after being in power; very few lived more than a few years into their rule as sultan. The first of these was Aybak, who married Shajar al-Durr (the widow of al-Salih Ayyub) and quickly began a war with the region of present-day Syria. He was assassinated in 1257 and was succeeded by Qutuz, who faced a growing danger from the Mongols.

Qutuz defeated the army of Hulagu Khan at the Battle of Ain Jalut in the year 1260, allowing him to regain all of Syria except for the Crusader strongholds. On the way back to Egypt after the battle, Qutuz died and was succeeded by another commander, Baybars, who assumed the sultanate and ruled from 1260 to 1277. In 1291, al-Ashraf Khalil captured Acre, the last of the crusader cities. The Bahris greatly enhanced the power and prestige of Egypt, building Cairo from a small town into one of the foremost cities in the world.

Due to the sacking of Baghdad by the Mongols in 1258, Cairo became the central city of the Islamic world. The Mamluks built much of the earliest remaining architecture of Cairo, including many mosques built out of stone using long, imposing lines.

Since 1347 the Egyptian population, economy, and political system experienced significant destruction as a result of the Black Death pandemic whose waves continued to destroy Egypt up to the early 16th century.

In 1377 a revolt in Syria spread to Egypt, and the government was taken over by the Circassians Berekeh and Barkuk. Barkuk was proclaimed sultan in 1382, ending the Bahri dynasty. He was expelled in 1389, but recaptured Cairo in 1390, setting up the Burji dynasty.

===Burji dynasty===
The Burji dynasty (1382–1517) proved especially turbulent, with political power-plays resulting in short-lived sultans. During the period, the Mamluks fought Timur Lenk and conquered Cyprus.

Plague epidemics continued to ruin Egypt when it spread over the region in 1388–1389, 1397–1398, 1403–1407, 1410–1411, 1415–1419, 1429–1430, 1438–1439, 1444–1449, 1455, 1459–1460, 1468–1469, 1476–1477, 1492, 1498, 1504–1505 and 1513–1514.

Constant political bickering contributed to the inability to resist the Ottomans, this would see the vassalization of Egypt under Ottoman Sultan Selim I. The sultan defeated the Mamluks and captured Cairo on 20 January 1517, transferring the center of power to Istanbul. However, the Ottoman Empire retained the Mamluks as the Egyptian ruling class. The Mamluks and the Burji family regained much of their influence, but technically remained vassals of the Ottomans. Egypt then entered into the middle period of the Ottoman Empire.

<text>Allama Iqbal International Airport (Punjabi, , ) is the third largest civilian airport by traffic in Pakistan, after Jinnah International Airport, Karachi and Islamabad International Airport. It serves Lahore, capital of Punjab and second-largest city of Pakistan. It also serves a large portion of the travellers from the other regions of Punjab province. Originally known as Lahore International Airport, it was renamed after the visionary poet and philosopher Dr. Allama Iqbal, one of the pioneers that led to the creation of Pakistan. The airport has three terminals: the Allama Iqbal terminal, the Hajj terminal and a cargo terminal. The airport is about 15 km from the centre of the city.

== History ==
=== Post independence ===
At the time of the Independence of Pakistan, Walton Airport was the main airport serving the city of Lahore. When Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) acquired its first jet aircraft, the Boeing 720, Walton Airport was unequipped to handle such an aircraft. The Government of Pakistan decided to build a brand new airport, which opened in 1962. The airport had a specifically built runway and apron to handle aircraft up to the Boeing 747. This enabled Lahore to become accessible by international flights. PIA initiated direct flights to both Dubai, and London via Karachi.

=== Expansion ===
==== New airport ====
Over the course of the next 25 years, the demand for air travel rose. The government had to build a bigger terminal to meet the growing needs of the region. In March 2003, a new terminal was inaugurated by President General Pervez Musharraf, originally commissioned by then ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The airport was named Allama Iqbal International Airport and became the second largest airport in Pakistan after the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi. All flights were switched to the new airport and the old airport was passed onto the military. However, the government later reclaimed the airport from the military and developed it into a Hajj terminal.

The Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority awarded the main contract to Airsys ATM, leader of a consortium with J&amp;P Overseas Ltd, an international building and civil engineering contractor. Airsys ATM is a joint project from Thomson-CSF Airsys and Siemens, dedicated to air traffic management systems and airport development. The Airports Group in the UK was also awarded a $70 million contract for airport systems construction. The project was implemented by a consortium of Joannou &amp; Paraskevaides (J&amp;P), responsible for civil and building works, and the Airports Group, responsible for the implementation of the system. Airsys ATM and Thales ATM were responsible for the fabrication and installation of the air bridges at the new terminal.

In March 2006, PIA inaugurated nonstop service between Lahore and Toronto using Boeing 777s. In 2008, the national flag carrier of the UAE, Etihad Airways, opened a dedicated aircraft line maintenance facility at the airport. The facility is used for day-to-day technical line maintenance on Etihad aircraft, including hydraulic structural and instrument checks.

In October 2020, British Airways has resumed its direct flight operations to and from Lahore after 44 years.

==== Future plans ====
Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) has planned the expansion of the terminal building and the number of gates will be increased from 7 to 22, with a corresponding increase in remote bays. This will increase the annual passenger capacity of Lahore Airport from 6 million to 20 million which will be sufficient to cater to the passenger load for the next 15 to 20 years.

The new design of the Lahore Airport Expansion Project has inspiration from the national flower of Pakistan, Jasmine or locally known as &quot;Chambeli&quot;. The airport will have four arms similar to four platters of jasmine flower. The original building has Mughal architectural features but the new airport will have a blend of Spanish and Mughal architecture.

Gates in the main terminal building will be increased from seven to 22. The present terminal building will not be demolished but will be expanded. The current parking area will be converted to arrival and departure lounges. The first phase that included the construction of the triple storey parking, in place of the front square lawn, has been complete and is now fully operational. The second phase which includes the upgradation of the main runway is underway.

The design of the airport was developed by GilBartolomé Architects from Spain, following a contract awarded to international Spanish Firm, TYSPA International, which firm also worked on expanding the Madrid and São Paulo Airports. A Chinese firm, the China Construction Third Engineering Bureau, has been awarded the contract, worth US$382 million (RMB 2.6 billion CNY), to carry out the construction work. During the expansion of the airport, nearby road network has also been improved, which has helped to ease traffic congestion on the roads leading to the terminal.

<doc id="377381" wikidata="Q2174847" url="?curid=377381" title="1954 Rugby League World Cup">
<text>The 1954 Rugby League World Cup was rugby league&#x27;s first World Cup and was held between 30 October and 13 November and hosted by France and was won by Great Britain who beat France in the final at the Parc des Princes in Paris. As it was the first official World Cup of either rugby code it was officially known as the Rugby World Cup.

Five nations were invited to compete: Australia, France, Great Britain, New Zealand and USA (However the USA would withdraw before the tournament began).

The prime instigators behind the idea of holding a rugby league world cup were the French, who were short of money following the seizing of their assets by French rugby union in the Second World War.

The first Rugby League World Cup was an unqualified success. It was played in a uniformly good spirit, provided an excellent standard of play and was a fitting celebration of France&#x27;s 20th anniversary as a rugby league-playing nation. The trophy, which was donated by the French, was worth eight million francs.

== Background ==
The World Cup was a French initiative. Led by Paul Barrière, who donated the Rugby League World Cup trophy himself, they had been campaigning for such a tournament since before the Second World War.

The uncertainty of the ultimate outcome was of particular interest. In the early 1950s all four competing nations were quite capable of beating each other – no test series in the period was a foregone conclusion.

If there were a favourite it was Australia who had just won back the Ashes. However, in 1953 they had lost series to both the French and the Kiwis, while Great Britain had defeated New Zealand on the second half of their 1954 Australasian tour.

The form book merely provided a conundrum which was made more confusing when the British were forced, through injuries and players making themselves unavailable, to select a raw and largely untried squad which was given little credibility by the cynics.

The captains for this historic event were Puig-Aubert (France), Cyril Eastlake (New Zealand), Clive Churchill (Australia) and Dave Valentine (Britain). The referees were Warrington&#x27;s Charlie Appleton and Rene Guidicelli (Perpignan).

== Participants == 

Five teams were invited to participate in the first World Cup; Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand and the United States along with hosts, France. There were concerns around the United States participation. The American All Stars who had toured Australia and New Zealand and drawn big crowds in 1953 but were heavily beaten in all their games as well as being beaten 31–0 by France in 1954. This led to doubts around whether an American team would be competitive enough to compete with the United States withdrawing from the tournament. It had been suggested that Wales could replace the United States but were not invited as Great Britain were already participating.

<text>Kuwait Airways (, ) is the flag carrier of Kuwait, with its head office on the grounds of Kuwait International Airport, Al Farwaniyah Governorate. It operates scheduled international services throughout the Middle East, to the Indian subcontinent, Europe, Southeast Asia and North America, from its main base at Kuwait International Airport.

==History==

The carrier traces its history back to 1953, when &quot;Kuwait National Airways&quot; was formed by a group of Kuwaiti businessmen; initially, the government took a 50% interest. That year, a five-year management contract was signed with &quot;British International Airlines&quot; (BIA), a BOAC subsidiary in Kuwait that operated charter flights and provided maintenance services. Two Dakotas were bought, and operations started on 16 March 1954. The carrier transported 8,966 passengers in its first year of operations. In July 1955, the name &quot;Kuwait Airways&quot; was adopted. In May 1958, a new contract for management and operation was signed, directly with BOAC this time. BIA was taken over by Kuwait Airways in April 1959.

On 8 August 1962, Kuwait Airways became the first foreign customer to order the Trident when two aircraft of the type were acquired, and an option for a third was taken. The deal was valued at £5.5 million, and also included a Comet 4C. At the same time, the carrier also had a £3 million order in place for three BAC One-Elevens, with an option for a fourth. The airline took delivery of the first Comet of its own in January 1963, but Comet operations had started in the previous year with an aircraft on lease from MEA. In August 1963, a second Comet was ordered. The delivery of this second airframe established an unofficial record in early 1964 when it flew between London and Kuwait, a distance of , at on average. On 1 June 1963, the government increased its participation in the airline to 100%. In March 1964, the carrier added its first European destination to the route network when flights to London were inaugurated using Comet equipment; from that time, services between London and some points in the Middle East, including Abadan, Bahrain, Beirut, Dhahran, Doha and Kuwait, started being operated in a pool agreement between the carrier and BOAC and MEA. A month later, the airline absorbed Trans Arabia Airways.
In April 1965, the route network had expanded to include Abadan, Baghdad, Bahrain, Beirut, Bombay, Cairo, Damascus, Doha, Frankfurt, Geneva, Jerusalem, Karachi, London, Paris and Tehran. At this time, the fleet comprised two Comet 4Cs, three DC-6Bs, two Twin Pioneers and three Viscount 700s; the carrier had two Trident 1Es and three One-Elevens pending delivery. The first Trident was handed over by the aircraft manufacturer in March 1966, and the second followed in the same year. In the interim, a third aircraft of the type was ordered. On the other hand, the One-Elevens were never delivered: in January 1966 the carrier stated that the simultaneous introduction of both types of aircraft was not possible due to a tightened budget, and postponed their delivery; it was informed late that year that the airline would not take them. Three Boeing 707-320Cs were ordered in November 1967. The carrier made its first profit ever in 1968, with a net income of £910,000.

During 1972, Kuwait Airways&#x27; consecutive profitable year, the airline had a net profit of £2.9 million. By May 1973, the fleet had reduced to five Boeing 707-320C aircraft. That year, flights to Colombo were launched. In March 1975, Faisal Saud Al-Fulaij, who employed 1,800, was the corporation&#x27;s chairman. In a deal worth  million, two additional ex-Pan American Boeing 707-320Cs were subsequently purchased that year, with the first one entering the fleet in . The carrier ordered its first Boeing 737 that year, slated for delivery in February 1976. Kuwait Airways became the Boeing 727s worldwide customer in 1979 when it ordered three of these aircraft for delivery in late 1980 and early 1981.
By July 1980, chairmanship was held by Ghassan Al-Nissef, the number of employees had grown to 5,400 and the fleet comprised eight Boeing 707-320Cs, one Boeing 737-200, three Boeing 747-200Bs and one JetStar; three Boeing 727-200s were pending delivery. In mid-1980, six Airbus A310-200s were ordered to replace the Boeing 707s on routes to Asia, Europe and the Middle East, with deliveries starting in 1983; five more A310 aircraft were added to the order late that year.

After India&#x27;s air market was deregulated in 1992, Kuwait Airways and Gulf Air participated in the formation of Jet Airways, each holding a 20% equity stake, with a total investment estimated at  million. Following the enactment of a law that banned the investment of foreign carriers in domestic Indian operators, both airlines had to divest their shareholding in the Indian company. Kuwait Airways&#x27; 20% stake in Jet Airways was sold to the chairman Naresh Goyal for  million.
In July 1996, the carrier modified a previous order that included Boeing 747 aircraft, and placed an order worth  million for two Boeing 777-200s, with purchase rights for another aircraft of the type. The operation made Kuwait Airways the customer of the type worldwide. The airframer handed over the first Boeing 777-200 in early 1998. In December 1998 a code-share agreement was signed with Trans World Airlines to begin in the Spring of 1999.

In October 2007, the new CEO pledged that the airline should be privatised to compete efficiently against other airlines. He says that the airline will encounter difficulty in advancing, especially in fleet renewal, without privatisation.

Flights to Iraq were resumed in November 2013; Kuwait Airways had discontinued services to the country in 1990 following the invasion of Kuwait. After a 17-year hiatus, the carrier resumed flying to Munich in July 2015. Also in July 2015, the airline restarted flights to Istanbul-Atatürk; the city had not been served for three years. Bangalore was added to the carrier network in October 2015.

===Airline&#x27;s relationship with Israeli passengers===
Kuwait Airways was accused of discriminating against holders of Israeli passports, for refusing in 2013 and 2014 to sell tickets from New York to London to people holding Israeli passports. In response, Senator Richard Blumenthal, along with five other senators, wrote a letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx in May 2015 urging him to investigate the allegations. In October 2015, at the conclusion of an investigation, the Department of Transportation issued Kuwait Airways an order to &quot;cease and desist from refusing to transport Israeli citizens between the U.S. and any third country where they are allowed to disembark&quot; In the letter, the DOT also accused Kuwait Airways of following the Arab League boycott of Israel. Additionally, New York City Councilmember Rory Lancman asked the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates JFK Airport, to &quot;terminate the airline&#x27;s lease if it doesn&#x27;t immediately change its policy.&quot; For its part, the airline said that it complies with Kuwaiti Law which prohibits the company from entering &quot;into an agreement, personally or indirectly, with entities or persons residing in Israel, or with Israeli citizenship.&quot; The airline also petitioned the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to review the dispute.

The matter was settled on 15 December 2015, when Kuwait Airways informed the United States Department of Transportation that it would eliminate service between JFK and London Heathrow, with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reporting that tickets for the route were no longer being sold effective the following week. Councilmember Lancman responded by saying &quot;If you&#x27;re so anti-Semitic that you would rather cancel a flight than provide service to Israeli passport holders, then good riddance.&quot;

A similar lawsuit was filed in 2017 by the Lawfare Project against the airline for refusing to allow Israelis on a flight from Frankfurt to Bangkok with a layover in Kuwait. Unlike the case of the New York to London route, in this lawsuit, the German court upheld the right of the airline to refuse passengers with Israeli passports to layover in Kuwait.

==Corporate affairs and identity==

===Ownership===
Kuwait Airways is wholly owned by the government of Kuwait, .

==== Privatisation plans ====
Privatisation started being considered in the mid-1990s, in a period that followed the Gulf War when the carrier experienced a heavy loss on its assets. The company was turned into a corporation in 2004. A draft decree for its privatisation was approved by the government on 21 July 2008. Plans were to sell up to 35% of the stake to a long-term investor and another 40% allotted to the public, whereas the government would hold the remaining 25%. These plans also contemplated the exclusion of domestic carrier competitors, such as Jazeera Airways, as potential bidders. Furthermore, the government also committed to keeping the workforce invariant for at least years and those who were not to be retained would be offered the opportunity to be transferred to other government dependencies without altering their salaries and holding similar working conditions.

In 2011, the privatisation committee valued the carrier at  million, following advice by the Citigroup, Ernst &amp; Young and Seabury. The process was expected to be concluded by March 2011. However, in that year the committee recommended the airline to go through a reorganisation process before continuing with the privatisation programme, something that was approved by Kuwait Council of Ministers. The privatisation draft was amended and the government signed a contract with the International Air Transport Association for the provision of consultation expertise. The law for the privatisation of Kuwait Airways Corporation was passed in January 2013.

=== Former fleet ===
===Fleet development===
In October 2013, Kuwait Airways had one of the oldest aircraft fleets in the Middle East, with an average age of 20 years. That month, the carrier opened its maintenance facilities to the press for them to check that the fleet was kept in condition, amid rumours of deficiencies in their maintenance. In the same year, the carrier signed a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for the acquisition of A320neos and A350-900s. These aircraft would be handed over between 2019 and 2022. For the interim period, the deal includes the lease of seven A320s and five A330-200s from the aircraft manufacturer; deliveries would start in late 2014. In a deal valued at  billion, the order including A350-900s and A320neos was confirmed in February 2014. Kuwait Airways&#x27; intentions to purchase Boeing 777-300ERs were informed in November 2014. The order was firmed up a month later for  billion with deliveries expected to start in November 2016. Also in December 2014, Kuwait Airways took delivery of its first sharketled Airbus A320 as part of the airline fleet renewal programme. Kuwait Airways received four leased aircraft of the type, marking the first fleet upgrade in 17 years. The carrier became a new customer for the Airbus A330 when it received the first aircraft of the type in June 2015.

Following the airline&#x27;s rebranding initiative in October 2016, Kuwait Airways received its first Boeing 777-300ER in December 2016, marking the arrival of the airline&#x27;s first fully owned new aircraft in nearly twenty years. Introduced in 1995, the Airbus A340-300 was retired from service by the airline in 2017. In October 2018, Kuwait Airways amended a pre-existing commitment with Airbus for 10 A350-900s by reducing it to five of these aircraft and ordered eight Airbus A330-800s, which were scheduled to be delivered from March 2019. The first two Airbus A330-800s were handed over to the airline by the aircraft manufacturer in October 2020.

In August 2019, Kuwait Airways Chairman Yousef A. M. J. Alsaqer stated that the airline plans to spend $2.5 billion on new aircraft due to be delivered by 2026.

== Awards ==

Kuwait Airways is one of the few airlines which does not serve alcoholic drinks on its flights.

==Incidents and accidents==
* On 30 June 1966, Kuwait Airways Flight 032, a Trident 1C flight from Beirut to Kuwait City, suffered a controlled flight into the ground four kilometres short of the runway. There were no fatalities and the Trident was written off.
* On 3 December 1984, Kuwait Airways Flight 221 from Kuwait City to Karachi, Pakistan, was hijacked by four Lebanese Shi&#x27;a hijackers and diverted to Tehran.
* On 5 April 1988, Kuwait Airways Flight 422 was hijacked from Bangkok to Kuwait with 111 passengers and crew aboard, with three members of the Kuwaiti Royal Family being among the passengers. Six or seven Lebanese men, including Hassan Izz-Al-Din, a veteran of the TWA 847 hijacking armed with guns and hand grenades forced the pilot to land in Mashhad, Iran and demanded the release of 17 Shi&#x27;ite Muslim prisoners being held by Kuwait. Lasting 16 days and travelling from Mashhad in northeastern Iran to Larnaca, Cyprus, and finally to Algiers, it is the longest skyjacking to date. Two passengers, Abdullah Khalidi, 25, and Khalid Ayoub Bandar, 20, both Kuwaitis, were shot to death by the hijackers and dumped on the tarmac in Cyprus. Kuwait did not release the 17 prisoners, and the hijackers were allowed to leave Algiers.
* In August 1990, in connection with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, several Kuwait Airways planes were reported to have been seized and removed by Iraqi troops.

<doc id="377384" wikidata="Q243634" url="?curid=377384" title="Bonin Islands">
<text>The Bonin Islands, also known as the , is a Japanese archipelago of over 30 subtropical and tropical islands located around SSE of Tokyo and northwest of Guam. The group as a whole has a total area of but only two of the islands are permanently inhabited, Chichijima and Hahajima. Together, their population was 2,560 as of 2021. Administratively, Tokyo&#x27;s Ogasawara Subprefecture also includes the settlements on the Volcano Islands and the Self-Defense Force post on Iwo Jima. The seat of government is Chichijima.

Because of the Bonins&#x27; isolation, many of their animals and plants have undergone unique evolutionary processes. It has been called &quot;the Galápagos of the Orient&quot; and was named a natural World Heritage Site in 2011. When first reached during the early modern period, the islands were entirely uninhabited. Subsequent research has found evidence of some prehistoric habitation by Micronesians. Upon their repeated rediscoveries, the islands were largely ignored by the Spanish, Dutch, and isolationist Japanese until finally being claimed by a passing British captain in 1827. American, European, and Hawaiian colonists arrived from the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1830. Subsequently, Meiji Japan successfully colonized and reclaimed the islands in 1875, but the original multicultural community continued up to World War II, when most islanders were forcibly relocated to Honshu. Following Japan&#x27;s defeat, the U.S. Navy occupied the island, bulldozing existing Japanese homes and restricting resettlement until full control of the Bonins was returned to Japan in 1968. Ethnically, the island is now majority Japanese but remains unusually diverse, which is reflected in the local Creole language known as Bonin English. Improved transportation has made agriculture more profitable and encouraged tourism, but the development required for an airport remains a contentious local issue.

==Names==
The name &quot;Bonin&quot; comes from an 1817 article in the French by Jean-Pierre Abel-Rémusat in whichamong various other misunderstandings of his source materialhe misread a description of the islands as uninhabited (, &quot;desert island[s]&quot;) for their actual name, used the wrong reading of the characters (&quot;buninshima&quot; for &quot;mujintō&quot;), and then transcribed the resulting reading incorrectly into French as , which eventually lost its original hyphen. 

The name &quot;Ogasawara&quot; (; ) literally means &quot;little hat-shaped field(s)&quot; but is used for the islands in honor of Ogasawara Sadayori (), a supposed ancestor of the ronin Ogasawara Sadatō () fictitiously credited with the discovery of the chain. Within Japanese, the Bonins proper are known as the &quot;Ogasawara Islands&quot; or &quot;Group&quot; (, &quot;Ogasawara-guntō&quot;) while the &quot;Ogasawara Islands&quot; or &quot;Archipelago&quot; (, &quot;Ogasawara-shotō&quot;) is a wider term including the other islands of the Ogasawara Municipality (, &quot;Ogasawara-mura&quot;) and its coterminous Ogasawara Subprefecture (, &quot;Ogasawara-shichō&quot;)namely, the Volcano Islands and three remote islands of Nishinoshima, Minamitorishima, and Okinotorishima. These islands are parts of Japan&#x27;s Nanpō Islands.

The islands were also formerly known to Europeans as the Archbishop Islands (), probably in honor of Pedro Moya de Contreras, archbishop of Mexico and viceroy of New Spain, who sent an expedition to the area in the late 16th century.

==History==

===Prehistory===
At the end of the 20th century, prehistoric tools and carved stones were discovered on North Iwo Jima and Chichijima, establishing that the islands were previously home to at least some members of an unknown Micronesian people.

===Early modern period===
The first recorded visit by Europeans to the islands happened on 2 October 1543, when the Spanish explorer Bernardo de la Torre on the &quot;San Juan&quot; sighted Haha-jima, which he charted as &quot;Forfana&quot;. The islands were uninhabited at that time. Japanese discovery of the islands occurred in &quot;Kanbun&quot; 10 (1670) and was followed by a shogunate expedition in &quot;Enpō&quot; 3 (1675). The islands were then referred to as , literally &quot;the uninhabited islands&quot;. Shimaya Ichizaemon, the explorer at the order of the shogunate, inventoried several species of trees and birds, but after his expedition, the shogunate abandoned any plans to develop the remote islands.

The first published description of the islands in the West was brought to Europe by Isaac Titsingh in 1796. His small library of Japanese books included by Hayashi Shihei. This book, which was published in Japan in 1785, briefly described the Ogasawara Islands.

These groups were collectively called the Archbishop Islands in Spanish sources of the 18th–19th century, most likely due to an expedition organized by Pedro Moya de Contreras, archbishop of Mexico and viceroy of New Spain, to explore the northern Pacific and the islands of Japan. Its main objective was to find the long sought but legendary islands of &quot;Rica de Oro&quot; (&quot;Rich in Gold&quot;), &quot;Rica de Plata&quot; (&quot;Rich in Silver&quot;), and the &quot;Islas del Armenio&quot; (&quot;Islands of the Armenian&quot;). After several years of planning and frustrated initial attempts, the expedition finally set sail on 12 July 1587, commanded by Pedro de Unamuno. Even if it did revisit the Daitō Islands, already charted by Bernardo de la Torre in 1543, the expedition could not find the wanted islands after searching the positions where they were charted in contemporary references. Japanese maps at the time seem to have been rather inaccurate, to the point that some contemporaries considered them to have been deliberately misleading to discourage colonization attempts by foreign nations. Frederick William Beechey used the Spanish name as late as 1831, believing that the Japanese &quot;Boninsima&quot; were entirely different islands.

===19th century===
On 12 September 1824, American Captain James Coffin in the whaler first visited the southern group of islands (&quot;Coffin Islands&quot;). He revisited the archipelago in 1825, but this time, he arrived at the middle group of islands (&quot;Beechey Group&quot;).

In September 1825, the British whaling ship &quot;Supply&quot; landed in the southern Bailey Group of islands. In 1826, another British whaler, &quot;William&quot;, arrived at Beechey Island. Whaling ships called regularly for water and turtles before continuing their voyages.

In 1827, Captain F. W. Beechey of reached the island chain and claimed them as a British possession. A copper plate was removed from &quot;Blossom&quot;″s hull and left on a beach as a marker of the claim:

He also named the island of Chichijima &quot;Peel&quot; after then British Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel. Beechey was also surprised to find two men living on the islands. They remained on the islands after the &quot;William&quot; left the year before in 1826. The men were Wittrein and Petersen.

In 1830, with the help of the British Consul to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), Richard Charlton, Richard Millichamp, and Matteo Mazzaro sailed to the islands. The first permanent colony was made up of Nathaniel Savory of Bradford, Massachusetts, America, Richard Millichamp of Devon, England; Matteo Mazzaro of Ragusa/Dubrovnik, Austrian Empire (now in Croatia); Alden B. Chapin and Nathaniel Savory of Boston; Carl Johnsen of Copenhagen; as well as seven unnamed men and 13 women from the Kingdom of Hawaii. They found the climate suitable for farming and the raising of livestock. Rum was made from cane sugar, and bordellos were opened, sometimes staffed by women kidnapped from other island chains. Whalers and other ships that could not find another friendly port in Japan often visited the Bonins for provision and recreation.

Two years later, the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland published a posthumous, abridged publication of Titsingh&#x27;s French translation of &quot;Sankoku Tsūran Zusetsu&quot;.

Further settlers arrived in 1846 aboard the whaling ship &quot;Howard&quot;. They established themselves initially in South Island. One of them, a woman from the Caroline Islands named Hypa, died in 1897 at the age of about 112, after being baptized on her deathbed.

Commodore Matthew C. Perry of the United States Navy visited the islands in 1853 and bought a property at Port Lloyd from Savory for $50. The US &quot;Colony of Peel Island&quot; (Chichijima) was created, and Savory was appointed governor.
In January 1862 (Bunkyū 1), the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan claimed the islands in a short-lived colonial enterprise. The shogunal steamboat &quot;Kanrin Maru&quot; was dispatched to the islands with a crew of cartographers, physicians, and prominent bureaucrats. The islands were officially renamed Ogasawara, referring to the legendary Japanese discoverer from the late 16th century. This tentative colonization, however, did not last for long. In the summer of 1863, under foreign pressure, the shogunate ordered the evacuation of the islands.

In 1875, the Japanese Meiji government reclaimed the islands. The Japanese names of each island were resolved, and 38 settlers from Hachijojima were sent the following year. In 1876, the islands were put under the direct control of the Home Ministry. Further, foreign settlements were banned, and the government assisted settlers who wished to relocate from mainland Japan. The islands&#x27; forests were also reduced to use the land for sugar cane production. Colonists largely segregated themselves in two different villages, one for the Americans and the other for the Japanese. Islanders of European and US ancestry were eventually granted Japanese nationality in 1882. Jack London visited the islands in 1893 and published an account of his sojourn.

===20th century===
Lionel Cholmondeley compiled a history of the islands over several years, publishing it in 1915.

In 1917, 60–70 island people claimed ancestry among the 19th-century English-speaking settlers; however, in 1941, no Bonin people would acknowledge descent from these early colonists. The current residents include some who claim to be related to Nathaniel Savory. In the winter of 1920–1921, Russian Futurist painter David Burliuk lived in the Bonin Islands and painted several landscapes of the islands.
The islanders were relegated to an insignificant status until the early Shōwa period. After Japan attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, English was banned on the Bonins, and Americans had to take on Japanese names. As fighting crept closer to Japan during the later stage of &lt;ins&gt;World War II&lt;/ins&gt;, most inhabitants were forcibly evacuated to the mainland. There was a Japanese military base on Chichijima run by a Major , who was known for engaging in cannibalism and other heinous acts on prisoners of war. The torpedo bomber of later American President George H. W. Bush crashed in the ocean near Chichijima. He ended up getting rescued by USS Finback and becoming the only one to survive ultimately. Eight other airmen downed near the islands were later executed and cannibalized by the Japanese soldiers. After the war, Lieutenant General Tachibana, Major Matoba, and Captain Yoshii were found guilty and hanged. The Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945, one of the fiercest battles of World War II, was fought on a garrison island in this region of the Pacific.

Following Japan&#x27;s surrender, the islands were controlled by the United States Navy for the next 23 years, which the Westerners referred to as &quot;Navy Time.&quot; All residents except those descended from the original settlers (the Ōbeikei Islanders) and/or related to them by marriage were expelled, while pre-war inhabitants of White American or European, Micronesian or Polynesian ancestry were allowed to return. Vacant properties of exiled Japanese were bulldozed as part of the Navy&#x27;s management of nuclear weapons on Chichijima. In 1956, the residents petitioned for American annexation of the islands but received no response. In 1968, the United States government returned the Bonins to Japanese control. The Ōbeikei could either become Japanese nationals or receive American citizenship and repatriate to the United States. The majority remained in the islands as Japanese citizens. Initially, 600 Japanese relocated to the islands, growing to about 2,000 by the end of the 20th century.

===21st century===
The Bonins were named a natural World Heritage Site on 24 June 2011.

==Economy==
Historically, the Bonin Islands consisted of subsistence farming with some exploitation of timber and grazing land for export to the mainland. With improved transportation, it has developed as a tourist destination, particularly for Japanese interested in scuba diving and ecotourism. Foreign tourists are also sometimes drawn by the islands&#x27; remoteness and unusually mixed local culture. Refrigeration has also allowed for the greater exportation of fruits and vegetables. Coffee bushes have also recently been introduced successfully.

Some government agencies are also involved with the islands. A radio telescope is located in Chichijima, one of the stations of the very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) project. It is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.

==Geography and administration==

The Bonin Islands consist of three subgroups. Their former names come from a variety of sources, but their Japanese ones generally reflect a family:
* Muko-jima Group ( ), formerly the Parry Group
**Muko-jima (, )
**Yome-jima (嫁島, ), formerly Kater Island
**Nakōdo-jima or Nakadachi-jima (媒島, )
**Kita-no-jima (北の島 or 北島, )
**Mae-jima (前島, ), formerly The Ears
* Chichi-jima Group (父島列島 ), formerly the Beechey Group
**Chichi-jima (父島, ), formerly the Main Island or Peel Island
**Ani-jima (兄島, ), formerly Hog Island or Buckland Island
**Otōto-jima (弟島, ), formerly North Island or Stapleton Island
**Mago-jima (孫島 )
**Higashi-jima (東島 )
**Nishi-jima (西島 ), formerly Goat Island
**Minami-jima (南島 ), formerly Knorr Island
* Haha-jima Group (母島列島 ), formerly the Baily Group or Coffin Islands
**Haha-jima (母島, ), formerly Hillsborough Island
**Mukō-jima (向島, ), formerly Plymouth Island
**Hira-jima or Taira-jima (平島, )
**Ane-jima (姉島, ), formerly Perry Island
**Imōto-jima (妹島, ), formerly Kelly Island
**Mei-jima (姪島, )

Although not part of the Bonins (, &quot;Ogasawara-guntō) geographically, the nearby Volcano Islands, Nishinoshima (Rosario Island), Okinotorishima (Parece Vela), and Minamitorishima (Marcus Island) are organized as part of Ogasawara municipality (小笠原村, &quot;Ogasawara-mura). Ogasawara itself is organized as a subprefecture of Tokyo. In Japanese, the geographical expression for the full range of the municipality is the &quot;Ogasawara Archipelago&quot; (, &quot;Ogasawara-shotō&quot;) which in turn is sometimes calqued back into English as another meaning for &quot;the Bonin Islands&quot;.

== Geology ==
The Bonin Islands are a part of the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc of Pacific islands. A fore arc, they lie above the subduction zone where the Pacific Plate slides beneath the Philippine Sea Plate. This began during the Eocene, simultaneously producing the deep Bonin Trench to the east about 50 million years ago and prolonged volcanic activity that created the islands on the west around 48 million years ago. The Bonins are mostly composed of an andesitic volcanic rock called boninite, rich in magnesium oxide, chromium, and silicon dioxide. They may represent the exposed parts of an ophiolite that has not yet been emplaced on oceanic crust. Although the area is currently dormant, most of the islands still have steep shorelines, often with sea cliffs ranging from high.

The Volcano Islands are much younger and still geologically active. Iwo Jima is a dormant volcano characterized by rapid uplift and several hot springs. The highest point in the entire chain lies on South Iwo Jima, at . In November 2013, a new volcanic island formed offshore from Nishinoshima and eventually merged with it.

The islands are fringed with healthy coral reefs and have many small beaches.

==Climate==
The climate of the Bonin Islands ranges from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) to tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;).

The climate of Chichijima is on the boundary between the humid subtropical climate (Köppen classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) and the tropical monsoon climate (Köppen classification &quot;Am&quot;). Temperatures are warm to hot all year round due to the warm currents from the North Pacific gyre surrounding the island. Rainfall is less heavy than in most parts of mainland Japan since the island is too far south to be influenced by the Aleutian Low and too far from Asia to receive monsoonal rainfall or orographic precipitation on the equatorward side of the Siberian High. The wettest months are May and September, while the driest are January and February.

The easternmost island, Minamitorishima or Marcus Island, has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen classification &quot;Aw&quot;) with warm to hot temperatures throughout the year. The wettest months are July and August, while the driest are February and March.

==Ecology==
===Flora===

Flora has evolved differently on each of the islands. The Bonin Islands are sometimes referred to as the Galápagos of the Orient. They form a distinct subtropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion, the Ogasawara subtropical moist forests. The ecoregion has a high degree of biodiversity and endemism. The islands are home to about 500 plant species, of which 43% are endemic. The forests are of three main types:

*Type I: &quot;Elaeocarpus–Ardisia&quot; mesic forest is found in moist lowland areas with deep soils. The forests have a closed canopy with a height of about , dominated by &quot;Ardisia sieboldii&quot;. &quot;Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius&quot;, &quot;Pisonia umbellifera&quot;, and &quot;Planchonella obovata&quot; are other important canopy species. These forests were almost completely destroyed by clearing for agriculture before 1945.
*Type II: &quot;Distylium–Raphiolepis–Schima&quot; dry forest is found in drier lowland and upland sites with shallower soils. It is also a closed-canopy forest, with a canopy composed mostly of &quot;Distylium lepidotum&quot;, &quot;Rhaphiolepis integerrima&quot;, &quot;Schima mertensiana&quot;, &quot;Planchonella obovata&quot;, and &quot;Syzygium buxifolium&quot;. The Type II forests can be further subdivided into:
**Type IIa: &quot;Distylium-Schima&quot; dry forest occurs in cloudy upland areas with fine-textured soils. These forests contain many rare and endemic species, with &quot;Pandanus boninensis&quot; and &quot;Syzygium buxifolium&quot; as the predominant trees.
**Type IIb: &quot;Raphiolepis-Livistona&quot; dry forest is found in upland areas with few clouds and rocky soils. &quot;Rhaphiolepis integerrima&quot; is the dominant tree species, along with the fan palm &quot;Livistona boninensis&quot;, &quot;Pandanus boninensis&quot; and &quot;Ochrosia nakaiana&quot;.
*Type III: &quot;Distylium-Planchonella&quot; scrub forest is found on windy and dry mountain ridges and exposed sea cliffs. These forests have the highest species diversity on the islands. &quot;Distylium lepidotum&quot; and &quot;Planchonella obovata&quot; are the dominant species, growing from tall. Other common shrubs are &quot;Myrsine okabeana&quot;, &quot;Symplocos kawakamii&quot;, and &quot;Pittosporum parvifolium&quot;.

These islands are home to the northernmost outliers of the palm genus . is endemic and has been planted in Mediterranean climates with success. Other unique species include , a plant related to similar species growing in Fiji and New Caledonia.

===Fauna===
Due to its isolation and recent colonization, the Bonin Islands contain several endemic animal species, most of them recently extinct.

==== Birds ====
The range of the Bonin petrel extends beyond the Bonins themselves to other islands in the North Pacific. There are two restricted-range species of birds on the islands, the Japanese wood pigeon () and the near-threatened Bonin white-eye (), formerly known as the Bonin honeyeater. The Japanese wood pigeon was extirpated from the Iwo Island groups in the 1980s. The formerly endemic Bonin pigeon (), Bonin thrush () and Bonin grosbeak () are now extinct. 

==== Mammals ====
A small extinct bat, Sturdee&#x27;s pipistrelle, is only known in one record and has not been seen since 1915. The Bonin flying fox (), also called the Bonin fruit bat, is endemic to the islands. It is currently listed as endangered, and a survey published by the Ogasawara Office of Education in 1999 estimated their number at around 100. The Bonin sambar (&quot;R. unicolor boninensis)&quot;, a subspecies of the sambar deer, was supposedly a population introduced to the islands only as late as 1850, but is also known from subfossil remains; it went extinct after 1925-26, when Richard Goldschmidt saw the taxidermied pair of the Chichijima museum and was told by locals that merely &quot;half a dozen&quot; animals remained alive

==== Invertebrates ====

The islands are also renowned for the many species of snails that are found across the islands, especially the snails. Most of the native snails are now endangered or extinct because of introduced species and habitat loss. The giant squid ( &quot;dux&quot;) was photographed off the Bonins for the first time in the wild on 30 September 2004. It was filmed alive there in December 2006.

== Transportation ==

===Water transport===
The main port is Futami on Chichijima. Since 2016, the main line connecting the islands to the mainland is the Ogasawara Shipping Company (). It operates the &quot;Ogasawara Maru&quot; (), an 11,035-ton long vessel with 170 private rooms and a total capacity of 894 passengers. With a top speed of , it makes the trip from Takeshiba Pier in Tokyo in about 24 hours in good weather. The number of monthly voyages varies, having fallen during the coronavirus pandemic.

Previously, there had been plans for a 14,500-ton &quot;techno superliner&quot; able to reach a maximum speed of and make the same journey in only 17 hours with a capacity of around 740 passengers. The project was canceled in July 2005, however, due to rising fuel prices and cost overruns of ¥2 billion.

Hahajima is reachable via the ferry &quot;Hahajima Maru&quot; from Chichijima.

===Road transport===
Ogasawara Village operates a bus service on Chichijima and elderly passengers may use a &quot;silver pass&quot;. There is also a sightseeing taxi service, a rental car company, motorized scooter rental services, a bike rental service, and other amenities. Bringing your automobile onto the island is extremely difficult and costly.

===Air transport===
The Bonins have no airport. During severe accidents, illnesses, and other emergencies, a helicopter is dispatched from the Self-Defense Force post on Iwo Jima. The &quot;ShinMaywa US-1&quot; seaplane from the SDF post at Iwakuni is used during visits by the Tokyo governor and other dignitaries and for any emergency requiring rapid transport back to Honshu.

For several decades, there has been talk of building a full airport. Sites on Chichijima and Anijima have both been rejected. Travel time to the mainland would be cut to around two hours, improving tourism and providing emergency services, and the national, regional, and local governments have all supported the idea in theory. Projects have lagged, however, due to concerns about their economic feasibility and concerns that the proposed sites are homes to numerous valuable, rare, or endangered plant species. Some locals have greatly desired an airport, while a desire to keep the islands&#x27; natural beauty untouched has prompted others to work to block one. The issue is quite controversial on the islands.

On 26 June 2016, the Japanese Minister of Environment Tamayo Marukawa talked about airport construction on the Bonins after the meeting in Tokyo commemorating the fifth anniversary of their registration as World Natural Heritage. At a 27 July 2017 meeting with Ogasawara Village, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government announced that it was considering opening a regular air route between Tokyo and the Bonins using a proposed runway that would be built on Chichijima. This would allow it to land propeller aircraft with up to 50 passengers. The Tokyo government said that construction would depend on future assessments of the impact on the natural environment and economic feasibility. Ogasawara Village supported the runway in preference to expanding either the current helicopter or seaplane access. In fiscal 2019, 490 million yen was included in the Japanese budget for a feasibility study and a survey on Chichijima to determine the best location to construct the runway. In August 2020, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government held a council during which it affirmed its desire to open an airport. Still, it claimed it would not occur until 2030 at the earliest. To address environmental concerns, they further proposed shortening the runway to about and using tiltrotor aircraft to compensate.

==Demography, language, and education==

In 2021, the Bonins had a population of 2560, divided between Chichijima (2120) and Hahajima (440). Virtually all of the Bonin Islands&#x27; permanent inhabitants are Japanese citizens. This includes a significant proportion of ancestors from the United States, Europe, and other Pacific islands, who can often be distinguished by their physical features, family names spelled out with katakana, and adherence to Christianity. During and after the US military occupation of 1946–68, a small minority of islanders opted for US citizenship and/or emigrated from the islands. However, most islanders with non-Japanese ancestry now appear to be reassimilating with the ethnic Japanese majority.

Japanese is the common language. Because settlers from the United States, Europe, and other Pacific islands preceded ethnic Japanese residents, an English-lexified pidgin which subsequently developed into a creole, known as Bonin English, Ogasawara Creole or Ogasawara Mixed Language, emerged on the islands during the 19th century. This was the result of Japanese being hybridized with island English, resulting in a mixed language that can still be heard.

The Ogasawara Village municipality operates public elementary and junior high schools, while Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education operates Ogasawara High School. In the post-World War II era, taught elementary students and high school students went to Guam to do their high school education. Ogasawara High opened in 1964.

== Fictional references ==
The Bonins have been referenced in several works of fiction. &quot;Bonin&quot; by Robert Standish describes itself as &#x27;a novel&#x27;, but claims &#x27;this book is an accurate history of the Bonin Islands&#x27;, based mainly on information from Nathaniel Savory&#x27;s great-granddaughter, and includes descriptions of maltreatment of the Anglo-Polynesian population by the later Japanese settlers and authorities and a detailed map of the Chichijima group (on the back end-paper), including over 50 English place-names.

Chapter XVI of Jack London&#x27;s autobiographical novel &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; says, &quot;This isolated group, belonging to Japan, had been selected as the rendezvous of the Canadian and American sealing fleets&quot;, and describes the drunken visit of a young sailor and his shipmates to the Bonin Islands.

In the television series &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, a fictional island in the chain, South Ataria Island (which would have laid at the southernmost position in the chain, surpassing Minami Iwo Jima), is the landing site of the SDF-1 Macross.

In the 1963 film &quot;Matango&quot;, a luxury yacht is set adrift and lands on an island. Upon approaching the island, one of the crew members shouts: &quot;I wonder if it&#x27;s the Bonin Islands?&quot; The English subtitles for the film misspell Bonin &quot;Bonan&quot;.

The 2017 anime film &quot;The Irregular at Magic High School: The Movie – The Girl Who Summons the Stars&quot; takes place on fictional islands in the Bonins.

<text>The or are a group of three Japanese-governed islands in Micronesia. They lie south of the Ogasawara Islands and belong to the municipality of Ogasawara, Tokyo, Tokyo Metropolis, Japan. The islands are all active volcanoes lying atop the Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc that stretches south to the Marianas. They have an area of , and a population of 380. The island of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands lies about southeast of Miyazaki.

== Geography ==
The Volcano Islands are:
*, , (Sakaki-ga-mine)
*, , (Suribachi-yama)
Farther north but in the same volcanic arc is:

There is a Japan Self-Defense Forces air base on Iwo Jima with a staff of 380. It is located in the village of Minami. Other than that, the islands are uninhabited.

*Fukutoku-Okanoba Generally submerged volcano eruptions sometimes bring it above the surface.

== History ==
The first recorded sighting by Europeans was in October 1543 by Spanish navigator Bernardo de la Torre on board of carrack &quot;San Juan de Letrán&quot; when trying to return from Sarangani to New Spain. Iwo Jima was charted as Sufre, the old Spanish term for sulphur.

The islands were uninhabited in 1889 when Japanese settlers settled the two northern islands from the Izu Islands. They were annexed by Japan in 1891. However, archeological evidence has revealed that islands of the greater Bonin archipelago were prehistorically inhabited by an unknown Micronesian people.

The population was about 1,100 in 1939, distributed among five settlements: Higashi, Minami, Nishi, Kita, and Motoyama (meaning &quot;East&quot;, &quot;South&quot;, &quot;West&quot;, &quot;North&quot;, and &quot;Mountain of Origin&quot;, or central mountain) on Iwo Jima; and two settlements on Kita Iwo Jima: Ishino-mura (&quot;Ishino village&quot;; Ishino is a surname) and Nishi-mura (&quot;West village&quot;). The municipal administration office was located in Higashi until 1940 when the municipality was integrated into the administration of Ogasawara, Tokyo.

Iwo Jima was the site of the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II, and the island group came under the United States administration. The Volcano Islands were returned to Japanese rule in 1968.

==Ecology==

The Volcano Islands have a subtropical climate. They are part of the Ogasawara subtropical moist forests ecoregion and are home to unique and diverse plants and animals, including many endemic species. They have been recognised as forming an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support populations of red-tailed tropicbirds, Japanese wood pigeons and Matsudaira&#x27;s storm petrels.

<doc id="377386" wikidata="Q337044" url="?curid=377386" title="1947 BSAA Avro Lancastrian Star Dust accident">
<text>On 2 August 1947, &quot;Star Dust&quot;, a British South American Airways (BSAA) Avro Lancastrian airliner on a flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Santiago, Chile, crashed into Mount Tupungato in the Argentine Andes. An extensive search operation failed to locate the wreckage, despite covering the area of the crash site. The fate of the aircraft and its occupants remained unknown for over fifty years, giving rise to various conspiracy theories about its disappearance.

In the late 1990s, pieces of wreckage from the missing aircraft began to emerge from the glacial ice. It is now believed that the crew became confused as to their exact location while flying at high altitudes through the (then poorly understood) jet stream. Mistakenly believing they had already cleared the mountain tops, they started their descent when they were in fact still behind cloud-covered peaks. &quot;Star Dust&quot; crashed into Mount Tupungato, killing all aboard and burying itself in snow and ice.

The last word in &quot;Star Dust&quot; final Morse code transmission to Santiago airport, &quot;STENDEC,&quot; was received by the airport control tower four minutes before its planned landing and repeated twice; it has never been satisfactorily explained.

== Background ==
The accident aircraft, an Avro 691 Lancastrian 3, was built as constructor&#x27;s number 1280 for the Argentine Ministry of Supply to carry thirteen passengers, and first flew on 27 November 1945. Its civil certificate of airworthiness (CofA) number 7282 was issued on 1 January 1946. It was delivered to BSAA on 12 January 1946, was registered on 16 January as G-AGWH and given the individual aircraft name &quot;Star Dust&quot;.

&quot;Star Dust&quot; carried six passengers and a crew of five on its final flight. The captain, Reginald Cook, was an experienced former Royal Air Force pilot with combat experience during the Second World War, as were his first officer, Norman Hilton Cook, and second officer, Donald Checklin DFC. Cook had been awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). The radio operator, Dennis Harmer, also had a record of wartime as well as civilian service. Iris Evans, who had previously served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (&quot;Wrens&quot;) as a chief petty officer, was the flight attendant.

&quot;Star Dust&quot; last flight was the final leg of BSAA Flight CS59, which had started in London on an Avro York named &quot;Star Mist&quot; on 29 July 1947, landing in Buenos Aires on 1 August. The passengers were one woman and five men of Palestinian, Swiss, German and British nationality. One was a British diplomatic courier, a King&#x27;s Messenger. Marta Limpert, a German émigré, was the only passenger known for certain to have initially boarded &quot;Star Mist&quot; in London before changing aircraft in Buenos Aires to continue on to Santiago with the other passengers.

== Disappearance ==

&quot;Star Dust&quot; left Buenos Aires at 1:46 pm on 2 August. This leg of the flight was apparently uneventful until the radio operator (Harmer) sent a routine message in Morse code to the airport in Santiago at 5:41 pm, announcing an expected arrival of 5:45 pm. However, &quot;Star Dust&quot; never arrived, no more radio transmissions were received by the airport, and intensive efforts by both Chilean and Argentine search teams, as well as by other BSAA pilots, failed to uncover any trace of the aircraft or of the people on board. The head of BSAA, Air Vice Marshal Don Bennett, personally directed an unsuccessful five-day search.

A report by an amateur radio operator who claimed to have received a faint SOS signal from &quot;Star Dust&quot; initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished aircraft failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose—including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to BSAA); speculation that &quot;Star Dust&quot; might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by the King&#x27;s Messenger; or even the suggestion that &quot;Star Dust&quot; had been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight&#x27;s final Morse code message).

== Discovery of wreckage and reconstruction of the crash ==

In 1998, two Argentine mountaineers climbing Mount Tupungato—about west-southwest of Mendoza, and about east of Santiago—found the wreckage of a Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine, along with twisted pieces of metal and shreds of clothing, in the Tupungato Glacier at an elevation of .

In 2000, an Argentine Army expedition found additional wreckage—including a propeller and wheels (one of which had an intact and inflated tyre)—and noted that the wreckage was well localised, a fact which pointed to a head-on impact with the ground, and which also ruled out a mid-air explosion. Human remains were also recovered, including three torsos, a foot in an ankle boot and a manicured hand. By 2002, the bodies of five of the eight British victims had been identified through DNA testing.

A recovered propeller showed that the engine had been running at near-cruising speed at the time of the impact. Additionally, the condition of the wheels proved that the undercarriage was still retracted, suggesting controlled flight into terrain rather than an attempted emergency landing. During the final portion of &quot;Star Dust&quot; flight, heavy clouds would have blocked visibility of the ground. It has therefore been suggested that, in the absence of visual sightings of the ground due to the clouds, a navigational error could have been made as the aircraft flew through the jet stream—a phenomenon not well understood in 1947, in which high-altitude winds can blow at high speed in directions different from those of winds observed at ground level. If the airliner, which had to cross the Andes mountain range at , had entered the jet-stream zone—which in this area normally blows from the west and south-west, resulting in the aircraft encountering a headwind—this would have significantly decreased the aircraft&#x27;s ground speed.

Mistakenly assuming their ground speed to be faster than it really was, the crew might have deduced that they had already safely crossed the Andes, and so commenced their descent to Santiago, whereas in fact they were still a considerable distance to the east-north-east and were approaching the cloud-enshrouded Tupungato Glacier at high speed. Some BSAA pilots, however, expressed scepticism at this theory; convinced that Cook would not have started his descent without a positive indication that he had crossed the mountains; they have suggested that strong winds may have brought down the craft in some other way. One of the pilots recalled that &quot;we had all been warned not to enter cloud over the mountains as the turbulence and icing posed too great a threat.&quot;

A set of events similar to those that doomed &quot;Star Dust&quot; also caused the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 in 1972 (depicted in the film &quot;Alive&quot;), although there were survivors from that crash because it involved a glancing blow to a mountainside rather than a head-on collision.

&quot;Star Dust&quot; is likely to have flown into a nearly vertical snowfield near the top of the glacier, causing an avalanche that buried the wreckage within seconds and concealed it from searchers. As the compressed snow turned to ice, the wreckage would have been incorporated into the body of the glacier, with fragments emerging many years later and much further down the mountain. Between 1998 and 2000, about ten per cent of the total expected wreckage emerged from the glacier, prompting several re-examinations of the accident. More debris is expected to emerge in future, not only as a result of normal glacial motion, but also as the glacier melts.

A 2000 Argentine Air Force investigation cleared Cook of any blame, concluding that the crash had resulted from &quot;a heavy snowstorm&quot; and &quot;very cloudy weather&quot;, as a result of which the crew &quot;were unable to correct their positioning&quot;.

== STENDEC ==
The last Morse code message sent by &quot;Star Dust&quot; was &quot;ETA SANTIAGO 17.45 HRS STENDEC&quot;. The Chilean Air Force radio operator at Santiago airport described this transmission as coming in &quot;loud and clear&quot; but very fast; as he did not recognise the last word, he requested clarification and heard &quot;STENDEC&quot; repeated twice in succession before contact with the aircraft was lost. This word has not been definitively explained and has given rise to much speculation.

The staff of the BBC television series &quot;Horizon&quot;—which presented an episode in 2000 on the &quot;Star Dust&quot; disappearance—received hundreds of messages from viewers proposing explanations of &quot;STENDEC.&quot; These included suggestions that the radio operator, possibly suffering from hypoxia, had scrambled the word &quot;DESCENT&quot; (of which &quot;STENDEC&quot; is an anagram); that &quot;STENDEC&quot; may have been the initials of some obscure phrase or that the airport radio operator had misheard the Morse code transmission despite it reportedly having been repeated multiple times. The &quot;Horizon&quot; staff concluded that, with the possible exception of some misunderstanding based on Morse code, none of these proposed solutions was plausible. 

The simplest explanation put forward to date is that the spacing of the rapidly sent message was misheard or sloppily sent. In Morse code, determining accurate spacing between characters is vital to properly interpret the message; &quot;STENDEC&quot; uses exactly the same dot/dash sequence as &quot;SCTI AR&quot; (SCTI being the ICAO four-letter code for Los Cerrillos Airport in Santiago, AR being the Morse abbreviation for &quot;over&quot;). Alternatively, the Morse spelling for &quot;STENDEC&quot; is one character off from instead spelling VALP, the call sign for the airport at Valparaiso, 110 kilometers north of Santiago.

<doc id="377387" wikidata="Q638729" url="?curid=377387" title="Immune thrombocytopenic purpura">
<text>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), also known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenia, is an autoimmune primary disorder of hemostasis characterized by a low platelet count in the absence of other causes. ITP often results in an increased risk of bleeding from mucosal surfaces (such as the nose or gums) or the skin (causing purpura and bruises). Depending on which age group is affected, ITP causes two distinct clinical syndromes: an acute form observed in children and a chronic form in adults. Acute ITP often follows a viral infection and is typically self-limited (resolving within two months), while the more chronic form (persisting for longer than six months) does not yet have a specific identified cause. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of ITP is similar in both syndromes involving antibodies against various platelet surface antigens such as glycoproteins. 

Diagnosis of ITP involves identifying a low platelet count through a complete blood count, a common blood test. However, since the diagnosis relies on excluding other potential causes of a low platelet count, additional investigations, such as a bone marrow biopsy, may be necessary in certain cases.

For mild cases, careful observation may be sufficient. However, in instances of very low platelet counts or significant bleeding, treatment options may include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, or immunosuppressive medications. &quot;Refractory ITP&quot;, which does not respond to conventional treatment or shows constant relapse after splenectomy, requires treatment to reduce the risk of significant bleeding. Platelet transfusions may be used in severe cases with extremely low platelet counts in individuals experiencing bleeding. In some cases, the body may compensate by producing abnormally large platelets.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs of ITP include the spontaneous formation of bruises (purpura) and petechiae (tiny bruises), especially on the extremities. Additionally, bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums, as well as menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), may occur if the platelet count falls below 20,000 per μL. A platelet count below 10,000 per μL can lead to the spontaneous formation of hematomas (blood masses) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes. Furthermore, bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged.

In cases where platelet counts drop to extremely low levels (&lt;5,000 per μL), serious and potentially fatal complications may arise. These complications include subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding inside the skull or brain), lower gastrointestinal bleeding, or other internal bleeding. A person with ITP with an extremely low platelet count is susceptible to internal bleeding resulting from blunt abdominal trauma, such as in a motor vehicle crash. These complications are more likely to occur when the platelet count is less than 20,000 per μL.

==Pathogenesis==
In approximately 60 percent of cases, antibodies against platelets can be detected. Most often these antibodies are against platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX, and are of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) type. The Harrington–Hollingsworth experiment established the immune pathogenesis of ITP.

The coating of platelets with IgG renders them susceptible to opsonization and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, as well by Kupffer cells in the liver. The IgG autoantibodies are also thought to damage megakaryocytes, the precursor cells to platelets, although this is believed to contribute only slightly to the decrease in platelet numbers. Recent research now indicates that impaired production of the glycoprotein hormone, thrombopoietin, which is the stimulant for platelet production, may be a contributing factor to the reduction in circulating platelets. This observation has led to the development of a class of ITP-targeted medications referred to as thrombopoietin receptor agonists.

The stimulus for auto-antibody production in ITP is probably abnormal T cell activity. Preliminary findings suggest that these T cells can be influenced by medications that target B cells, such as rituximab.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of ITP is a process of exclusion. First, it has to be determined that there are no blood abnormalities other than a low platelet count, and no physical signs other than bleeding. Then, secondary causes (around 5–10 percent of suspected ITP cases) should be excluded including medications (quinine or heparin), viral infection (HIV or HCV), malignancy (leukemia), autoimmune conditions (systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome), onyalai, and others. All patients with presumed ITP should be tested for HIV and hepatitis C virus, as platelet counts may be corrected by treating the underlying disease. In approximately 2.7 to 5 percent of cases, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and ITP coexist, a condition referred to as Evans syndrome.

Despite the destruction of platelets by splenic macrophages, the spleen is normally not enlarged. In fact, an enlarged spleen should lead to a search for other possible causes for the thrombocytopenia. Bleeding time is usually prolonged in ITP patients. However, the use of bleeding time in diagnosis is discouraged by the American Society of Hematology practice guidelines and a normal bleeding time does not exclude a platelet disorder.

Bone marrow examination may be performed on patients over the age of 60 and those who do not respond to treatment, or when the diagnosis is in doubt. On examination of the marrow, an increase in the production of megakaryocytes may be observed and may help in establishing a diagnosis of ITP. An analysis for anti-platelet antibodies is a matter of clinician&#x27;s preference, as there is disagreement on whether the 80 percent specificity of this test is sufficient to be clinically useful.

==Treatment==
With rare exceptions, there is usually no need to treat based on platelet counts. Many older recommendations suggested a certain platelet count threshold (usually somewhere below 20.0/nL) as an indication for hospitalization or treatment. Current guidelines recommend treatment for adults with significant bleeding or counts below 30/nL, with very low certainty of evidence.
Treatment recommendations sometimes differ for adult and pediatric ITP.

===Steroids===
Initial treatment usually consists of the administration of corticosteroids, a group of medications that suppress the immune system. The dose and mode of administration is determined by platelet count and whether there is active bleeding: in urgent situations, infusions of dexamethasone or methylprednisolone may be used, while oral prednisone or prednisolone may suffice in less severe cases. Once the platelet count has improved, the dose of steroid is gradually reduced while the possibility of relapse is monitored. 60–90 percent will experience a relapse during dose reduction or cessation. Long-term steroids are avoided if possible because of potential side-effects that include osteoporosis, diabetes and cataracts.

===Anti-D===
Another option, suitable for Rh-positive patients with functional spleens is intravenous administration of Rho(D) immune globulin [Human; Anti-D]. The mechanism of action of anti-D is not fully understood. However, following administration, anti-D-coated red blood cell complexes saturate Fcγ receptor sites on macrophages, resulting in preferential destruction of red blood cells (RBCs), therefore sparing antibody-coated platelets. There are two anti-D products indicated for use in patients with ITP: WinRho SDF and Rhophylac. The most common adverse reactions are headache (15%), nausea/vomiting (12%) chills (&lt;2%) and fever (1%).. Following a black-box warning of possible uncontrolled hemolytic reactions, use of intravenous anti-D declined sharply. Intramuscular anti-D has been suggested as an alternative, with one case series reporting a 73% response rate.

===Steroid-sparing agents===
There is increasing use of immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine because of their effectiveness. In chronic refractory cases, where immune pathogenesis has been confirmed, the off-label use of the &quot;vinca&quot; alkaloid and chemotherapy agent vincristine may be attempted. However, vincristine has significant side effects and its use in treating ITP must be approached with caution, especially in children.

===Intravenous immunoglobulin===
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may be infused in some cases in order to decrease the rate at which macrophages consume antibody-tagged platelets. However, while sometimes effective, it is costly and produces improvement that generally lasts less than a month. Nevertheless, in the case of an ITP patient already scheduled for surgery who has a dangerously low platelet count and has experienced a poor response to other treatments, IVIg can rapidly increase platelet counts, and can also help reduce the risk of major bleeding by transiently increasing platelet counts.

===Thrombopoietin receptor agonists===

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists are pharmaceutical agents that stimulate platelet production in the bone marrow. In this, they differ from the previously discussed agents that act by attempting to curtail platelet destruction. Two such products are currently available:
* Romiplostim (trade name Nplate) is a thrombopoiesis stimulating Fc-peptide fusion protein (peptibody) that is administered by subcutaneous injection. Designated an orphan drug in 2003 under United States law, clinical trials demonstrated romiplostim to be effective in treating chronic ITP, especially in relapsed post-splenectomy patients. Romiplostim was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long-term treatment of adult chronic ITP on August 22, 2008.
* Eltrombopag (trade name Promacta in the US, Revolade in the EU) is an orally-administered agent with an effect similar to that of romiplostim. It too has been demonstrated to increase platelet counts and decrease bleeding in a dose-dependent manner. Developed by GlaxoSmithKline and also designated an orphan drug by the FDA, Promacta was approved by the FDA on November 20, 2008.

Thrombopoietin receptor agonists exhibited the greatest success so far in treating patients with refractory ITP.

Side effects of thrombopoietin receptor agonists include headache, joint or muscle pain, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and an increased risk of blood clots.

===Surgery===
Splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may be considered in patients who are either unresponsive to steroid treatment, have frequent relapses, or cannot be tapered off steroids after a few months. Platelets which have been bound by antibodies are taken up by macrophages in the spleen (which have Fc receptors), and so removal of the spleen reduces platelet destruction. The procedure is potentially risky in ITP cases due to the increased possibility of significant bleeding during surgery. Durable remission following splenectomy is achieved in 60 — 80 percent of ITP cases. Even though there is a consensus regarding the short-term efficacy of splenectomy, findings on its long-term efficacy and side-effects are controversial. After splenectomy, 11.6–75 percent of ITP cases relapsed, and 8.7–40 percent of ITP cases had no response to splenectomy. The use of splenectomy to treat ITP has diminished since the development of steroid therapy and other pharmaceutical remedies.

===Platelet transfusion===
Platelet transfusion alone is normally not recommended except in an emergency and is usually unsuccessful in producing a long-term platelet count increase. This is because the underlying autoimmune mechanism that is destroying the patient&#x27;s platelets will also destroy donor platelets, and so platelet transfusions are &quot;not&quot; considered a long-term treatment option.

===&quot;H. pylori&quot; eradication===
In adults, particularly those living in areas with a high prevalence of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; (which normally inhabits the stomach wall and has been associated with peptic ulcers), identification and treatment of this infection has been shown to improve platelet counts in a third of patients. In a fifth, the platelet count normalized completely; this response rate is similar to that found in treatment with rituximab, which is more expensive and less safe. In children, this approach is not supported by evidence, except in high prevalence areas. Urea breath testing and stool antigen testing perform better than serology-based tests; moreover, serology may be false-positive after treatment with IVIG.

===Other agents===
* Dapsone (also called diphenylsulfone, DDS, or avlosulfon) is an anti-infective sulfone medication. Dapsone may also be helpful in treating lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and as a second-line treatment for ITP. The mechanism by which dapsone assists in ITP is unclear but an increased platelet count is seen in 40–60 percent of recipients.
* The off-label use of rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the B cell surface antigen CD20, may sometimes be an effective alternative to splenectomy. However, significant side-effects can occur, and randomized controlled trials are inconclusive.
* Fostamatinib was approved for refractory chronic ITP in the United States in April 2018. Fostamatinib blocks the activity of the enzyme spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK), thus reducing FcγR-mediated signal transduction and phagocytosis by monocyte/macrophages. Adverse effects include diarrhea, hypertension, and abnormal liver function tests.
* In a phase 1-2 open-label study treatment with CM313, a novel anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, rapidly boosted platelet levels in adults with ITP by inhibiting antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity on platelets; maintained long-term efficacy by clearing plasma cells; and was associated with low-grade toxic effects. 
* Ianalumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the BAFF receptor BAFF-R to inhibit B-cell signaling and deplete B cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The VAYHIT1 study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ianalumab for ITP.

==Prognosis==
In general, patients with acute ITP will only rarely have life-threatening bleeding. Most patients ultimately have lower, but stable platelet counts, which are still hemostatic for the patient. Unlike children and adolescents, ITP is often chronic in adults, even after a splenectomy.

== Epidemiology ==
A normal platelet count is considered to be in the range of 150,000–450,000 per microlitre (μL) of blood for most healthy individuals. Hence one may be considered thrombocytopenic below that range, although the threshold for a diagnosis of ITP is not tied to any specific number.

The incidence of ITP is estimated at 50–100 new cases per million per year, with children accounting for half of that number. At least 70 percent of childhood cases will end up in remission within six months, even without treatment. Moreover, a third of the remaining chronic cases will usually remit during follow-up observation, and another third will end up with only mild thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count above 50,000). A number of immune related genes and polymorphisms have been identified as influencing predisposition to ITP, with FCGR3a-V158 allele and KIRDS2/DL2 increasing susceptibility and KIR2DS5 shown to be protective.

ITP is usually chronic in adults and the probability of durable remission is 20–40 percent. The male to female ratio in the adult group varies from 1:1.2 to 1.7 in most age ranges (childhood cases are roughly equal for both sexes) and the median age of adults at the diagnosis is 56–60. The ratio between male and female adult cases tends to widen with age. In the United States, the adult chronic population is thought to be approximately 60,000—with women outnumbering men approximately 2 to 1, which has resulted in ITP being designated an orphan disease.

The mortality rate due to chronic ITP varies but tends to be higher relative to the general population for any age range. In a study conducted in Great Britain, it was noted that ITP causes an approximately 60 percent higher rate of mortality compared to sex- and age-matched subjects without ITP. This increased risk of death with ITP is largely concentrated in the middle-aged and elderly. Ninety-six percent of reported ITP-related deaths were individuals 45 years or older. No significant difference was noted in the rate of survival between males and females.

== Pregnancy == 
The incidence of ITP in pregnancy is not well known. It may occur during any trimester of pregnancy. It is the most common cause of significant thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 100,000) in the second trimester, and it is a common cause of significant thrombocytopenia in the first and third trimesters. As in non-pregnant individuals, ITP in pregnancy is a diagnosis of exclusion and other potential causes of low platelets in pregnancy require consideration. These include obstetrical causes such as pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets), or thrombotic microangiopathies that may occur during pregnancy. Other causes of thrombocytopenia which may occur in pregnancy, such as drug induced thrombocytopenia, hereditary thrombocytopenia and pseudothrombocytopenia should also be ruled out. ITP can be difficult to distinguish from gestational thrombocytopenia (which is by far the most common cause of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy). Unlike ITP, the platelet count in gestational thrombocytopenia rarely goes below 100,000, and a platelet count below 80,000 is even more rare (seen in less than 0.1% of cases of gestational thrombocytopenia). Also unlike ITP, gestational thrombocytopenia is not a cause of neonatal or maternal bleeding, or neonatal thrombocytopenia.

Women with ITP often have a decrease in their platelet counts when they become pregnant, often requiring treatment. Pregnant women with ITP are 1.83 times more likely to have bleeding episodes during pregnancy compared to non-pregnant females with ITP, however, with proper treatment, platelets rarely drop below 30,000. In ITP, severe bleeding is a rare occurrence, and with treatment maternal deaths due to ITP are extremely rare. ITP has not been found to increase the risk of some common obstetrical complications; with no increased risk of pre-eclampsia, premature delivery, placental abruption or blood clots observed. Further, in those with ITP, platelet counts usually return to pre-pregnancy levels after delivery. 

Anti-platelet autoantibodies in a pregnant woman with ITP will attack the patient&#x27;s own platelets and will also cross the placenta and react against fetal platelets leading to thrombocytopenia. Thrombopoietin levels are also increased during pregnancy (which is thought to be due to placental production of estradiol) and this estradiol leads to decreased megakaryocyte activity and therefore decreased platelet production. Therefore, ITP is a significant cause of fetal and neonatal immune thrombocytopenia. Approximately 10% of newborns affected by ITP will have platelet counts &lt;50,000/uL and 1% to 2% will have a risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, comparable to that of infants with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT).

No lab test can reliably predict if neonatal thrombocytopenia will occur. The risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia is increased with:
* Mothers with a history of splenectomy for ITP
* Mothers who had a previous infant affected with ITP
* Gestational (maternal) platelet count less than 100,000/uL

It is recommended that pregnant women with thrombocytopenia or a previous diagnosis of ITP be tested for serum antiplatelet antibodies. Indications for treatment of pregnant people with ITP include the presence of bleeding, platelet counts less than 20-30,000, planned procedures (such as an amniocentesis), and raising platelet levels prior to delivery (the minimum platelet level for a vaginal delivery is 30,000 and for a cesarean section is 50,000). Rarely, a platelet transfusion may be needed to facilitate safe delivery. First line therapies for ITP include steroids such as prednisone, IVIG or both. Second line therapies (usually used in those in whom first line therapies fail and thrombocytopenia persists) include rituximab, thrombopoetin receptor agonsists (such as romiplostim), or a splenectomy. Platelet transfusions may be performed in newborns, depending on the degree of thrombocytopenia. IVIG and steroids (methylprednisolone) may also be given to raise the platelet counts. It is recommended that neonates be followed with serial platelet counts for the first few days after birth. Ultrasound or MRI are also recommended for severely thrombocytopenic infants to rule out a brain bleed.

==History==
After initial reports by the Portuguese physician Amato Lusitano in 1556 and Lazarus de la Rivière (physician to the King of France) in 1658, it was the German physician and poet Paul Gottlieb Werlhof who in 1735 wrote the most complete initial report of the purpura of ITP. Platelets were unknown at the time. The name &quot;Werlhof&#x27;s disease&quot; was used more widely before the current descriptive name became more popular. Platelets were described in the early 19th century, and in the 1880s several investigators linked the purpura with abnormalities in the platelet count. The first report of a successful therapy for ITP was in 1916, when a young Polish medical student, Paul Kaznelson, described a female patient&#x27;s response to a splenectomy. Splenectomy remained a first-line remedy until the introduction of steroid therapy in the 1950s.

<text>Elektra Natchios (, ) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She was initially created as a supporting character for the superhero Matt Murdock / Daredevil, to whom Elektra has functioned as a villainous adversary, love interest, and later, a heroic ally. Created by Frank Miller, the character first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #168 (Jan. 1981). Her violent nature and mercenary lifestyle has served as a divisive point of conflict between her and Daredevil, which, in 2020, culminated in her becoming the second Daredevil.

The character is a highly trained assassin of Greek descent who wields a pair of sai as her trademark weapons. Elektra is one of Frank Miller&#x27;s best-known creations, and has appeared in numerous modern storylines even though Marvel had promised not to revive the character without Miller&#x27;s permission. She is the title character of three ongoing series: The first, written by Peter Milligan and Larry Hama and drawn by Mike Deodato Jr., from 1996 to 1997; the second, primarily written by Greg Rucka, from 2001 to 2003; and the third, written by Haden Blackman, from 2014 to 2015. She has also appeared as a supporting character of Wolverine and in other series and mini-series.

Jennifer Garner portrayed Elektra in the films &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003), &quot;Elektra&quot; (2005), and &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024). Élodie Yung portrayed the character in the MCU television series &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Defenders&quot; (2017).

== Publication history ==
===Creation===

Elektra was created by Frank Miller, who based the character&#x27;s appearance on Lisa Lyon, a female bodybuilder. Miller and Janson also sometimes modeled her appearance on the actress Bo Derek. Miller has said that he designed the character around Electra, a character in Greek tragedy, and the Electra complex theorized by Carl Jung. Comics scholar Paul Young has identified the first appearances of the character as paying homage to Sand Seref, a femme fatale character in Will Eisner&#x27;s series, &quot;The Spirit&quot;. Miller has frequently cited Eisner as an inspiration. Some critics have also compared the character to Catwoman, who has a similar ambivalent relationship with Batman, although Elektra is portrayed as much more dangerous and violent.

===Frank Miller period: 1980s and early 1990s===
Elektra first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #168 (January 1981). Miller intended this issue, which was essentially a filler story, to be Elektra&#x27;s only appearance. She instead became a frequently appearing villain in &quot;Daredevil&quot;, until she was murdered by Bullseye in issue #181 (April 1982). She was resurrected shortly after, but the story contained a narrative note which indicates that Daredevil must never encounter her again.

Miller collaborated with Bill Sienkiewicz on &quot;&quot;, a surrealistic, satirical miniseries that ran from 1986 to 1987, with unclear relation to mainstream continuity. Mary Jo Duffy, the editor who initiated the project, writes that Sienkiewicz was the chosen artist because of his skills: &quot;the fine drafting, the loony caricatures, and the high-style infusion of sex-and-drugs-and-rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll.&quot; In the story, Elektra discovers that a US presidential candidate intends to launch a nuclear war, and in opposing him she comes into conflict with S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, cyborgs and monsters. The series concludes with the successful election of the candidate, but the replacement of his mind by another character whose motives are ambiguous. The Daredevil &quot;Fall from Grace&quot; storyline establishes that &quot;Elektra: Assassin&quot; is a hallucinatory distortion of canonical events in which Elektra took part, in the mind of a delusional S.H.I.E.L.D. cyborg named John Garret (who is the main protagonist of the story).

In 1990, Elektra appeared in another Miller creation, &quot;Elektra Lives Again&quot;. This is an avant-garde story that takes place outside normal Marvel continuity. It won an Eisner Award for &quot;Best Graphic Album: New&quot;.

In 1993, Miller revisited the character in the miniseries &quot;&quot;. Taking place in the past before Matt Murdock took on the Daredevil identity, the story elaborates the relationship between Murdock and Elektra Natchios.

===1990s===
After over a decade&#x27;s absence from regular continuity, she reappeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #324–327 (Jan.–April 1994). &quot;Daredevil&quot; writer D. G. Chichester recounted that he and editor Ralph Macchio had discussed the character&#x27;s return several times:

This upset Frank Miller, who claimed that Marvel had previously promised him that the character would not be used in any publication.

Electra served as a supporting character in &quot;Wolverine&quot;, written by Larry Hama (in #100–106). The Wolverine story arc establishes that Elektra has been re-trained and rehabilitated by Stick and is now morally good. While she remains unusually ruthless, this is the first time she takes on a heroic role. As a spin-off of this storyline, in 1996 she starred in an ongoing series that lasted nineteen issues, initially written by the same author along with Peter Milligan and illustrated by Mike Deodato Jr. The series establishes that Elektra was resurrected by the Chaste, the adversaries of the Hand. The series has a much lighter tone, sometimes including parody of romance comics, and Elektra is much more virtuous. The narrative declares, &quot;She was once a wild-eyed assassin ... of course, she&#x27;s a completely different person now.&quot; However, she struggles with a tendency to relapse into her earlier, more indiscriminately violent, tendencies. Elektra briefly resumes her relationship with Daredevil in this series, although he is unfaithful to his primary girlfriend at that time, Karen Page.

===2000s===
Elektra appeared in a second self-titled ongoing series that lasted 22 issues, from 2001 to 2003. While initially written by Brian Michael Bendis, the series was primarily written (after issue #6) by Greg Rucka. This series ignores the events of the previous series written by Milligan, and Elektra returns to her earlier morally-ambiguous, tormented characterization. In 2002, Rucka also wrote a novella featuring the character along with Wolverine, titled &quot;Elektra and Wolverine: The Redeemer&quot;. While this is a prose narrative rather than a graphic novel, it includes extensive illustrations by Yoshitaka Amano. The status of the story with Marvel mainstream canon is unclear; the characters do not appear to have met before, and do not make reference to earlier stories in the Hama and Milligan series in which they interact. In an interview concerning his approach to these characters, Rucka comments on Elektra&#x27;s allure as tied to her mysterious and enigmatic nature, and states that for this reason she is very difficult to write or to identify with. He describes it as a compelling emotional detachment, and contrasts this to Wolverine&#x27;s demeanor, which he sees as warmer.

Beginning in Ultimate Spider-Man #51 (February 2004), an alternate version of Elektra serves as a recurring adversary in Brian Michael Bendis&#x27;s acclaimed re-interpretation of Spider-Man in the Ultimate Marvel timeline. In October of the same year, this alternate version of the character featured in her own five-issue miniseries written by Mike Carey and illustrated by Salvador Larroca, with Daredevil as a supporting character.

Also in 2004, Elektra appears as a prominent leading character in Mark Millar&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine&quot; storyline &quot;Enemy of the State,&quot; with art by John Romita Jr. (who previously drew Elektra in the &quot;Man without Fear&quot; miniseries a decade earlier). In this storyline, she works with SHIELD to help Wolverine fight the Hand. In the course of events, she appears to be re-brainwashed by the Hand, although this is revealed to be a ruse on her part. However, in order to maintain the deception, she kills a number of SHIELD agents in cold blood.

In the mainstream Marvel universe, Elektra encounters Matt Murdock again in &quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 2 #77 through #81 (November 2005 - March 2006), written by Bendis and illustrated by Alex Maleev. In this storyline, she arrives to warn Murdock about Kingpin&#x27;s public revelation and confirmation of his secret identity.

In 2007, in the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline also written by Bendis, Elektra is kidnapped and replaced by a Skrull, an alien being who can shapeshift to impersonate others. This Skrull is then killed, and the true Elektra is restored to Earth. In 2009, Elektra re-appears after her kidnapping by the Skrulls in the miniseries &quot;Dark Reign: Elektra&quot; by Zeb Wells.

===2010s===
In the &quot;Shadowland&quot; series of 2010, written by Andy Diggle, Elektra fights Daredevil, who has now himself been corrupted by the Hand.

In 2013, Wells returned to the character in a sequel to &quot;Dark Reign&quot;, in which Elektra again teams up with Wolverine, this time against Kingpin. This occurs in a story arc of &quot;Savage Wolverine&quot;.

Elektra featured in a third ongoing series from 2014 to 2015, written by Haden Blackman. This was illustrated in a more surreal, psychedelic style reminiscent of Bill Sienkiewicz&#x27;s depiction of the character in the 1980s. The primary artist, Mike del Mundo, affirms that his approach is an homage to &quot;Elektra: Assassin&quot;. Leah Bernstein, a comic-book critic, acclaims this as the best of the Elektra series. Blackman affirms that the character is difficult to write, because it is hard to avoid what he describes as &quot;the stigma of being &#x27;Daredevil&#x27;s dead girlfriend.&#x27;&quot; Nonetheless he concludes that upon completion this was the story and character he is &quot;most proud of writing.&quot;

Elektra reappears in the &quot;Daredevil&quot; series in a storyline beginning in April 2016, written by Charles Soule. In this story, Elektra is supernaturally deluded into believing that she has a daughter.

In 2019, Elektra featured as part of the Savage Avengers, along with Wolverine, Punisher, Venom, Brother Voodoo, and Conan the Barbarian.

Elektra again encounters Daredevil in a long story arc written by Chip Zdarsky, beginning with &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2019) #10 (July 2019). As a result of the spell cast to maintain Daredevil&#x27;s secret identity, Elektra has separated her memories of Matt Murdock and Daredevil and thinks of them as two separate men.

===2020s===
Elektra continues to feature in Chip Zdarsky&#x27;s run of &quot;Daredevil&quot;. While Daredevil is incarcerated, Elektra decides that she needs to impress him with her commitment to protecting innocent people in Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. In order to do this, she becomes a new Daredevil, making a new costume for herself that modifies the original. She later joins forces with the original Daredevil and they work together as a team up to the conclusion of Zdarsky&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot; series with issue #36 in February 2022. In her new persona, Elektra is also the main protagonist of Zdarsky&#x27;s three-issue miniseries &quot;Daredevil: Woman without Fear&quot;, the first issue of which appeared in March 2022. In this story, she fights Kraven the Hunter. Elektra and Daredevil co-star in the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; miniseries and Marvel event, which concluded in May 2022. Subsequently, they are the leading protagonists in Zdarsky&#x27;s new &quot;Daredevil&quot; series, which concluded in April 2023.

In 2021, Elektra also appeared in a new mini-series titled &quot;Elektra: Black, White and Blood&quot;. Largely outside of mainstream continuity, each issue features a different writer and generally in the horror comics genre. Authors include Charles Soule, Peter David, Ann Nocenti, Peach Momoko, and Kevin Eastman.

==Personality and characteristics==
Elektra is an unusually ruthless antihero and femme fatale. Scholar Paul Young defines some of her defining initial characteristics as including her succinct speech patterns, her &quot;athletic, eroticized body,&quot; her father complex, and her lethal weapons and fighting prowess. He notes that another critic, Larry Rodman, memorably compared her to a &quot;psychotic swimsuit model.&quot; Young points out that Elektra combines the femme fatale of film noir with chopsocky martial arts films. The character is also associated with hypersexuality, particularly in the 1993 &quot;Man without Fear&quot; miniseries.

She shows few compunctions about killing her adversaries, and in some stories even kills innocent people. However, she maintains a strong affection for Matt Murdock and, later, other people she admires. She is often morally conflicted and attempts to use her skills for good. Miller says that Elektra&#x27;s violent disposition originates from the trauma of the loss of her father, and that he meant the character to illustrate Jung&#x27;s Electra complex: &quot;She was a young woman who had her sexual interest centered on her father, and just as she was transferring this to another man, her father is killed.&quot; Miller argues that this initial anger led to corruption by other forces (the Hand and the Kingpin). In his view she is not essentially good, but rather &quot;one of the villains who&#x27;s got a weak streak in them.&quot; After her resurrection, in the 1996 ongoing series written by Peter Milligan, she has a more conventionally heroic disposition, but in subsequent stories her moral character continues to vacillate.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Family and early life ===
Elektra was born on a Greek island near the Aegean Sea, to Hugo Kostas Natchios and Christina Natchios. She had an older brother named Orestez.

Two contradictory accounts of her family history have been given. In &quot;Elektra: Root of Evil&quot; #1–4 (March–June 1995), Christina is killed by assassins hired by Orestez, while in &quot;Elektra&quot; #18 (1995), she is killed by an insurrectionist during the Greek Civil War. In both accounts, she gives premature birth to Elektra just before dying.

When nine-year-old Elektra was assaulted by kidnappers, the men were all killed by Orestez, who had grown into an accomplished martial artist after leaving home. Orestez advised his father that Elektra needed to learn self-defense. Hugo hired a sensei to teach her the martial arts.

In &quot;&quot; #1 (Aug. 1986), the adult Elektra has vague memories of being raped by her father as a five-year-old. Years of counseling and medication had convinced her this was a false memory, but the doubt remained. Elektra grew up close to her father but was plagued by dark visions and voices with no known source. She occasionally reacted to them with self-harm. Her father eventually sent her away to psychotherapy to become more stable. It was uncertain whether Elektra actually became more stable or merely appeared to be. She became a black belt in karate at age 12.

=== Activities as an adult ===

Hugo Natchios eventually served as a Greek ambassador to the United States. Nineteen-year-old Elektra attended Columbia University in New York City. There, Elektra began dating classmate Matt Murdock. A year later, Elektra and her father were kidnapped by terrorists. A rescue attempt by Matt went wrong, and Hugo was gunned down. Elektra lost faith and hope. She quit Columbia and returned to China to study martial arts. Stick, a member of the benevolent Chaste organization, recognized the darkness in her soul and attempted to train her himself, but she ultimately sided with the Hand, a sect of mystical ninja who trained her as an assassin. She later broke away from them and became an independent agent, and in this role she encountered Daredevil. She defeated Daredevil in her mission to kill the criminal Alarich Wallenquist. However, she failed her assignment, and Daredevil had to save her from being killed by Eric Slaughter, revealing his secret identity to her in the process. Although the pair worked together to fight the Hand, they also came into conflict.

Elektra later battled the Hand alongside Daredevil and Gladiator. She then battled Kirigi.

She soon became the chief assassin in the employ of the Kingpin, New York City&#x27;s premier crime lord. She attempted to kill Daredevil after he tried to stop her from terrorizing Ben Urich. The Kingpin then assigned her to kill Franklin &quot;Foggy&quot; Nelson, Matt&#x27;s partner. When Nelson recognized Elektra as Matt&#x27;s college girlfriend, she was unable to kill him.

Elektra was fatally stabbed by Bullseye with one of her own sai in a battle over which of them would be the Kingpin&#x27;s assassin. Elektra managed to crawl to Daredevil&#x27;s house before dying in his arms as Bullseye watched the two, hidden among a crowd that had gathered to see what was going on. Later, members of The Hand stole her body and attempted to resurrect her. Daredevil, with the assistance of Stone, a member of Stick&#x27;s order, intervened, defeating The Hand ninja. Daredevil then tried to revive Elektra himself. Although his attempt failed, it did have the effect of purifying Elektra&#x27;s soul. Elektra&#x27;s body subsequently disappeared, as did Stone.

Later, Elektra was found to have been resurrected by Stone and residing upon the Chaste mountain, where she claimed to have found peace. It was revealed that when Elektra was resurrected, the evil aspect of her soul had physically split apart from her and had been placed in its own body by the Snakeroot (a part of The Hand), as a consequence of the ritual performed by Daredevil. Her darker half called itself Erynys (). Erynys was tasked to get the About Face Virus for the Snakeroot so that the merger of the corpse and Elektra&#x27;s essence would become permanent, allowing them complete control over an obedient version of the assassin. Confronted by Daredevil, Stone and Elektra, the Snakeroot fought back in a gruelling battle over the virus. Eventually, Erynys was killed, thus returning the dark side to Elektra&#x27;s soul.

Some time later, Stick sent Elektra to help Wolverine at a time when physically and mentally regressed to a bestial form. She helped retrain Logan to the point where the latter could think and vocalise as a human once more, and spent time thereafter as the X-Man returned to a normal form, including taking Logan with her on a visit to her ancestral home.

Seeking a focus for her life, Elektra recruited her own order of fighters and mercenaries called the Ryu, to oppose the Snakeroot. She proved to be a poor leader, however, and the entire Ryu was killed trying to prevent the Snakeroot from assassinating a set of pure souls for their cause. Elektra ultimately completed the destruction of the Snakeroot and the protection of the last soul alone.

Later, Elektra asked martial-artist King Lau and boxer McKinley Stewart to help her open a Dojo. After a showdown with Bullseye led to the death of a young woman&#x27;s father, Elektra took in the girl, Nina, as her roommate and ward. During this time, a villain named the Architect was calling all super-villains to meet in New York City, for a competition to have Elektra kill him so that he could be reborn in a new host body. With the help of Doctor Strange, the Architect was killed and his essence was trapped in the body of a small demon, caged by Strange.

She was hired by Nick Fury to assassinate Saddam Abed Dassam, the leader of Iraq who was in league with HYDRA, and retrieve the Scorpio Key. Fury hired her as a way to avoid accountability in global political circles. HYDRA tried to hire her, an offer she refused. They then set the Silver Samurai on to her and it appeared she killed the Silver Samurai though the latter appeared alive and well in other comics. When she eventually obtained the Scorpio Key, she refused to give it to Fury, believing that Fury could not be trusted with such a powerful weapon. She instead gave it to the police officer who had killed her father, stating that the officer had a debt to her and would not let her down.

===Wolverine: Enemy of the State===
Elektra worked with S.H.I.E.L.D.

HYDRA and The Hand joined forces, killing off various heroes and resurrecting them into their possessed warriors, including Wolverine, who became their killing machine. Based on her relationship with Logan and her ties to the Hand, Fury hired Elektra to lead the mission, paying her in excess of $200,000, more money in one day than the (then) yearly salary of the President of the United States. She worked to stop Wolverine from killing others as well as to try to turn him back to his normal self. During a fight with The Hand, Elektra was killed and resurrected as a Hand warrior, eventually becoming their leader. Along with the X-Man Northstar and other superhumans killed and resurrected by the Hand, Elektra attacked Fury, injuring the latter badly and causing the destruction of a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier.

Thanks to S.H.I.E.L.D., Wolverine eventually came to his senses and wanted revenge. During a fight with Elektra, she mentally spoke to Wolverine, using new abilities given to her by the Hand. She explained that being killed by The Hand was all part of a plan she had from the beginning. She explained that she had been resurrected by The Hand and infiltrated the organization, making them believe they had been successful in resurrecting her as a brainwashed warrior. She told him that they would take The Hand and HYDRA down together. They fought off many ninjas and were victorious. Gorgon, however, attacked Elektra and threw off her mental blocks, enabling him to read her thoughts and see where Fury was being treated for his injuries (he also discovered that the Vatican also hired her, to kill him). Gorgon teleported, with Elektra, to kill Fury. When they arrived, Elektra ordered the S.H.I.E.L.D. soldiers to attack. Gorgon used his power on her neck and she collapsed. Wolverine eventually used Gorgon&#x27;s own powers against him, defeating him.

In an email to Kitty Pryde, Fury says that Elektra has survived albeit missing and probably in Eastern Europe, creating her own militia group which intends to be her own version of The Hand. Fury also says that Elektra is at present, no threat. It is during the time following the helicarrier&#x27;s destruction that she is abducted by Skrulls and replaced with an imposter.

=== Daredevil and the Kingpin ===
Elektra resurfaces to help Daredevil with a situation with the Kingpin. The crime lord, in exchange for his freedom, offered the FBI irrefutable evidence that Matt was Daredevil.

It is revealed that Elektra actually helped the Kingpin gain all the needed information back when she was Daredevil&#x27;s enemy, and she returned because she felt an obligation to help Matt out of the trouble for which she felt responsible. It was also revealed by the Black Widow that Elektra is now the leader of The Hand.

Daredevil meets up with Elektra, the Black Widow, and the new White Tiger in front of the building that holds the &quot;Murdock Papers&quot; (the evidence Kingpin was talking about). They intended to retrieve the papers before the FBI could get there, but were suddenly attacked by Bullseye. Daredevil and Elektra fought the villain and, after a lengthy and bloody battle, won. However, Daredevil was suddenly shot by Paladin (who was working for FBI operatives) and was left bleeding profusely in Elektra&#x27;s arms. Elektra then takes Matt to the Night Nurse, but insists that The Hand should cure him. Black Widow appears and objects. While Elektra and Black Widow fight, The Hand heals Murdock.

Outside the Night Nurse&#x27;s medical office, reporters and police gather. Elektra then jumps out the side window, along with The Hand to drive off the police and FBI. She gets in a quarrel with Luke Cage, and quickly exits the scene at Matt&#x27;s request.

It was later revealed that &quot;Elektra&quot; was actually a Skrull and not the real Elektra.

=== Replacement by Skrulls ===

Elektra seemingly reappears, appearing to be corrupted by the Hand. She kills, resurrects, and imprisons the vigilante Maya Lopez to use as a weapon. The New Avengers rescue Lopez who ends up stabbing Elektra to death, however, her death revealed that &quot;Elektra&quot; is actually a Skrull in disguise.

It turns out that the real Elektra was selected to be replaced by the Skrull Siri. Elektra was targeted by several Skrull impostors while staying in Japan, but she fought and killed most of these Skrulls (including Siri). Elektra gets blindsided and severely beaten by the Super-Skrull Pagon who ultimately took Elektra&#x27;s place (since Siri was killed by Elektra) as a major &quot;reveal&quot; of Veranke&#x27;s intent to take over the world&#x27;s superheroes.

The real Elektra was revealed to be alive upon one of the Skrull ships and was released during the final battle between the heroes and the Skrulls. Iron Man immediately orders her held in protective custody at S.H.I.E.L.D.

===&quot;Dark Reign&quot;===
Being the only Skrull captive showing signs of experimentation and torture, Elektra finds herself weakened by multiple injuries. Norman Osborn orders her studied and monitored to obtain information as to why this was the case. Paladin breaks into H.A.M.M.E.R. headquarters intending to kill Elektra for $82 million. She overpowers Paladin and chokes him by spitting her broken tooth down his throat. She forces him to surrender the keys to her to escape. Before leaving the cell, she murders the interrogator who was torturing her for information. She finally makes her escape after taking down several H.A.M.M.E.R. operatives and manages to reach Murdock&#x27;s office to raid his stash of first aid supplies. After being confronted by Nelson, she collapses from extensive blood loss due to her injuries.

Elektra wakes up handcuffed to a hospital bed in the Night Nurse&#x27;s clinic. The nurse explains that she bound Elektra for her own safety, although the ninja easily frees herself. Their conversation is interrupted when a hit woman named Nico breaks in and attempts to kill both of them. Elektra sends Nico flying out the window then arms herself with the ninja&#x27;s weapons while telling the Night Nurse to escape. Elektra jumps into the alley and battles Nico, only to find that another hit man named Carmine is also attempting to kill her with a sniper rifle from a rooftop. She manages to defeat Nico while evading Carmine&#x27;s shots and obtains some clues from Nico as to why she was being targeted for assassination. On the rooftop, Carmine is murdered by Bullseye (in the guise of Hawkeye) who was sent by Osborn to kill Elektra.

Elektra climbs to the top of the building to confront the third assassin, only to be taken aback when she discovers that he is Bullseye. Although initially hesitant, she stands her ground and faces her killer. The two begin to fight when Nico manages to reach the rooftop to check on Carmine. Bullseye attempts to kill her with a drug laced arrow, but she is saved by Elektra (who accidentally gets the drugs on the arrow in her system in the process). Bullseye then kicks the seemingly sedated Elektra off the building, but she manages to land safely. Bullseye follows and confronts her on the street, attempting to kill her with her own sai, much like their first encounter. However, this time Elektra outmaneuvers him and stabs him through the back with one of his own arrows. Nico once more interrupts the fight, attempting to shoot the fleeing Bullseye, then confronting the heavily drugged, helpless Elektra. H.A.M.M.E.R. agents enter the fray and shoot Nico, but are ambushed and killed by Wolverine before they can finish Elektra off.

After escaping H.A.M.M.E.R., Wolverine reveals to Elektra where Nico ran, and Elektra tries to confront the problem head on and peaceably end the conflict. Arriving at the Blackhawk crash site, she discovers that Agent Brothers, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, was the one who put a price on her head. Brothers claims that she was responsible for killing hundreds of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents during the Blackhawk incident. Elektra, having no memory of the incident, denies the accusations and urges both Brothers and Nico to go in peace, stating that it was her Skrull impostor who was responsible for the incident. However, Osborn then appears, and reveals that Elektra was in fact abducted after the Helicarrier attack, although she has no memory of this because she had used a mind trick to &quot;forget&quot; her resurrections and the incidents surrounding them to prevent the Skrulls from accessing them during her abduction. Osborn taunts Elektra to undo this mind trick, and Elektra obliges. It is then revealed that Elektra is actually guilty of the accusations. She then proceeds to kill both Nico and Brothers.

=== Code Red ===
Elektra was involved in an incident with the Red Hulk, X-Force, a new villain, the Red She-Hulk, and a few other well known mercenaries such as Deadpool and the Punisher.

=== Shadowland ===

In &quot;Shadowland&quot; storyline, Stick tries to convince Elektra to help stop the Hand from corrupting Matt. But she refuses, because she wanted him to be cold-hearted just like her out of spite for him. She reconsiders when she witnessed the broadcast of Daredevil killing Bullseye. She joins the Hand so she can gain intel on the Shadowland fortress to help the super heroes infiltrate it. Later upon rejoining the Hand, Elektra visits Daredevil and Typhoid Mary at Bullseye&#x27;s grave intending to resurrect him. She then helps sneak the super heroes into the building, to stop Daredevil from resurrecting Bullseye. A fight erupts and just when Elektra tried to reach out to Matt, the Demon of the Hand finally possesses him. Once he defeats all of the super heroes, Iron Fist used his chi energy on the demon to help heal Matt&#x27;s soul. While that was happening, Elektra entered Matt&#x27;s mind to encourage him fight the evil presence of the demon. Matt killed himself to stop the demon from causing any more chaos. Elektra later resurrected him.

===Thunderbolts===
As part of the 2012 Marvel NOW! branding, Elektra becomes a member of Red Hulk&#x27;s Thunderbolts.

===Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.===
During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Elektra was incarcerated for some unknown reason in Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D. S.H.I.E.L.D. used the powers of Kobik to turn her into Sheriff Eva. During this time, she was in love with Absorbing Man&#x27;s altered human form of an ice cream vendor named Henry. After Baron Helmut Zemo and Fixer started using a machine to turn all the inmates back to normal, Elektra was among those restored. She talked Absorbing Man out to harming the innocent lives at Pleasant Hill.

During the 2016 &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Elektra joined S.H.I.E.L.D. to free her conscience of the deaths of the passengers of the crashed Black Hawk. She took the position of field director when Phil Coulson left the group. When Coulson was trying to interfere with Captain Marvel&#x27;s plans to use Ulysses Cain&#x27;s abilities to stop crime before it happens, Elektra discovered that Leo Fitz was Coulson&#x27;s mole in her group which Maria Hill was alerted to. At the same time, she also reinstated Grant Ward into S.H.I.E.L.D. and placed an explosive collar on his neck to ensure his loyalty.

=== Becoming Daredevil ===
During Chip Zdarsky&#x27;s run on &quot;Daredevil&quot;, Elektra seeks out Murdock to help form an organization called The Fist to take down The Hand once and for all. To prove herself trustworthy, she takes up the mantle of Daredevil and protects Hell Kitchen while Matt is in prison.

== Powers and abilities ==
Elektra&#x27;s primary abilities are a strong knowledge of martial arts and weaponry. Elektra learned ancient martial arts of China, Siam, and Japan. She is a master combatant with the Okinawan sai, her usual weapon of choice. She is also highly skilled with the katana, daggers, three-section staff, and shuriken. She is a master of many Japanese combat forms including Ninjutsu, Aikido and Karate. Elektra is an Olympic-level athlete, strong in gymnastics and swimming, with superior strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, endurance, dexterity, reactions, coordination and balance. She is resistant to pain and extreme heat and cold. She is also able to keep to the shadows and move with such speed that she can remain unseen even in daylight.

Elektra has the ability to others, and as such make them see illusions or other phenomena.

Elektra also has the ability to &quot;throw&quot; her mind into those of others. For instance, she was able to track down her enemy, Ken Wind, by temporarily &quot;borrowing&quot; people&#x27;s minds and acting through them while she hunted around for her prey. This temporary mind control enables her to metaphorically sniff out the psyche, or intent, of her targets. It saw extensive use during &quot;&quot;, in which she was heavily reliant on only her ninja powers.

Elektra can communicate telepathically with individuals possessing similar levels of mental discipline, such as the Chaste. She mastered this ability during training with The Hand, which mentally links her to The Beast, the demigod of The Hand. She is able to shield her mind from others.

She can see glimpses of future events across precognitive visions.

== Themes and motifs ==
Elektra stories tend to emphasize her characteristics as a sex symbol and femme fatale. For example, in the 1996 ongoing series she speaks of the &quot;fevered desires&quot; and &quot;dark, sensual fantasies&quot; she inspires in men. The Frank Miller stories in particular also explore madness, sadism, death, and mourning. The &quot;Elektra: Assassin&quot; miniseries is a satire on American culture and politics, in which idealistic justifications for US policy have hidden, obscene motives of dominance, lust, and self-destruction.

== Supporting characters==
Elektra was initially a supporting character for Daredevil, as an early girlfriend and an antagonist. He often appears in stories in which she is the main protagonist. She also commonly appears in a stories featuring Wolverine, who at one point refers to her as a &quot;kindred spirit.&quot; She also sometimes works together with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.. Her primary antagonists and enemies include the Hand and Bullseye, who at one time succeeded in murdering her (although she was resurrected).

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
J. Andrew Deman describes Elektra as &quot;an iconic Marvel warrior woman.&quot; Following her example, the popular character Psylocke of the X-Men adopted as similar costume and fighting style, in 1989. As with Elektra, the Hand trains and shapes Psylocke into a ninja assassin.

Elektra was one of the primary inspirations for the Bad girl art trend of the 1990s in American comics.

Doug Petrie, a writer for &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, credits Elektra as the inspiration for the character of Faith. In his view, &quot;In a different, teen, punkier context, Faith is so much like Elektra.&quot;

== Other versions ==

=== What If? ===
In the story &quot;What If Elektra Had Lived?&quot;, penned by Frank Miller, Elektra&#x27;s murder at the hands of Bullseye does not occur as Bullseye is cut down and killed while trying to escape from prison. Elektra spares Franklin Nelson&#x27;s life, irritating the Kingpin, who swiftly orders her execution. After fighting off several assassination attempts, Elektra flees to Matt Murdock&#x27;s brownstone home. Murdock initially wants to take Elektra into custody, but she warns him that with the Kingpin putting a bounty on her head, she will die at the hands of his agents if she is sent to prison. Murdock decides to flee New York with Elektra, putting up his home for sale and cutting off contact with Nelson. The couple are last seen enjoying a quiet sunset on a beach, far removed from society and seemingly happy.

=== House of M ===
Elektra appears as one of the assassins of the Kingpin and is later hired by John Proudstar to bring down Luke Cage&#x27;s &quot;Avengers&quot;.

=== Marvel Zombies ===
In the &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; arc &quot;Crossover&quot;, Elektra is seen among the zombie hordes preparing to attack Magneto, Mr. Fantastic, and the few living humans they are protecting. She is also among the zombies that attack (and infect) Frank Castle. The infected Wolverine from this incident travels to another Earth where he kills the human Elektra with his claws, impaling her through the stomach in the manner of Bullseye.

=== Mutant X ===
In the Mutant X Universe – an alternate world which was visited by the Earth-616 (mainstream Marvel Universe) Havok – Elektra (surname: Stavros), while still equally trained as a martial artist and assassin, is the nanny and bodyguard of Scotty Summers. Scotty is the son of that reality&#x27;s Alex Summers and Madelyne Pryor. Elektra stays close to Scotty, protecting him from repeated assaults by his mother, the Goblin Queen, and her brainwashed allies. Following the disappearance of the Goblin Queen, she indulges in an affair with Havok. She seemingly dies near the end of the series, though Scotty reassures Alex that she will come back.

=== Ultimate Marvel ===
:&quot; See also: Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra and Ultimate Elektra for information on the two starring miniseries.&quot;
In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Elektra Natchios is a student at Columbia University who has a knack for martial arts and is a great fan of Bruce Lee. Her mother died of breast cancer when she was 6, and her father is trying to make money with a laundromat.

In this universe, she starts out as a sweet, innocent girl who cares deeply for her loved ones – so deeply that she is willing to go over dead bodies to help them. This trait starts her descent into becoming one of the most deadly assassins in the world.

There is a gap between the Elektra featured in &quot;Ultimate Daredevil and Elektra&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Elektra&quot; and the one shown in &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;. In the first two arcs, she is a normal college student, but in the last arc – which is set a few years later – she has become the Kingpin&#x27;s right hand and is a villainess. She is hired by an unknown person to kill a Latverian terrorist, but Spider-Man prevented her from doing it. She is shown in this universe as a highly dangerous and skilled killer, and was able to take down the likes of Hammerhead, Black Cat, Moon Knight, and Spider-Man easily. She was later put into a coma when Moon Knight threw one of his crescent blades at her, hitting her in the head when she was about to kill Black Cat.

=== PunisherMax ===
A more &quot;realistic&quot; version of Elektra appears in the &quot;PunisherMAX&quot; series, from Marvel&#x27;s &quot;MAX&quot; imprint. This version of the character is Japanese: the Hand lends her services as a bodyguard to the Kingpin, especially to protect him from the Punisher. She also becomes the Kingpin&#x27;s lover. It is revealed that Elektra was secretly hired by Kingpin&#x27;s ex-wife Vanessa to assassinate him for failing to prevent the murder of their son Richard. It is also revealed that she is in a lesbian relationship with her. Elektra eventually has a final confrontation with the Punisher to save Vanessa. She manages to seriously wound the Punisher, but is shot several times and left permanently incapacitated. Later, a representative from the Hand has one of his men finish her with a sword.

=== Secret Wars (2015) ===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, there are two different Elektras that exist in Battleworld:

* A Wild West version of Elektra resides on the Battleworld domain of the Valley of Doom. She is seen as a minion of Governor Roxxon alongside Bullseye, Grizzly, and Otto Octavius where they were first seen intimidating Judge Franklin Nelson into leaving town so that he wouldn&#x27;t preside over Red Wolf&#x27;s trial. Sheriff Steve Rogers and Red Wolf later fought the villains which ended with Otto Octavius being killed in battle, Bullseye killing Sheriff Rogers, and Natasha Barnes diverting the remaining villains in the other direction so that she can hide Red Wolf. Elektra and Grizzly later fought Red Wolf again where they end up defeated by him.
* Elektra is known as Red Sai, the leader of the Red Hand school in the &quot;wuxia&quot;-inspired K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un region of Battleworld. Due to an oath made by a previous master of the Red Hand to serve every emperor of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un, she serves as Emperor Zheng Zu&#x27;s assassin. Red Sai is also the former friend and lover of Shang-Chi, the emperor&#x27;s son, who was exiled for the murder of Lord Tuan, the previous master of the Iron Fist. During the tournament to decide the new ruler of K&#x27;un-L&#x27;un, Red Sai and Rand-K&#x27;ai, Tuan&#x27;s pupil, fight Shang-Chi in the penultimate round of the Thirteen Chambers. During the fight, Red Sai confesses that Zu had sent her to assassinate his rival Tuan but ultimately failed. To spare his lover and her students from the emperor&#x27;s wrath, Shang-Chi killed Tuan; Zu implicated and exiled his son for the murder to cover his own involvement. After the truth is revealed, Red Sai and Rand-K&#x27;ai let Shang-Chi pass so that he could defeat his father. After Shang-Chi emerges victorious, Red Sai pledges herself to the new emperor.

== In other media ==
=== Television ===
Elektra appears in Marvel&#x27;s Netflix television series, portrayed by Élodie Yung as an adult and by Lily Chee in flashbacks.
* First appearing in the second season of &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2016), this version was trained by Stick from childhood until the Chaste deemed her too dangerous and he had her adopted by Hugo and Christina Natchios to keep her safe. While in college, she met and dated Matt Murdock. In the present, Stick sends her back to New York City to make him return to his side and help defeat the Hand. Though she falls in love with him, they break up after she fails to make Murdock kill Roscoe Sweeney for killing his father years prior. Murdock attempts to reconcile with her by convincing her to leave Stick and become her own person, but she seeks revenge on Stick after one of his assassins attacks her. When Stick gets kidnapped by the Hand, Elektra and Murdock work together to find him, discovering she was destined to become the Hand&#x27;s leader &quot;Black Sky&quot; in the process, though he helps her choose her own path. She later sacrifices herself to save Murdock from the Hand&#x27;s forces, but they dig up her body and prepare to revive her.
* Elektra appears in &quot;The Defenders&quot;. Revived and now working for the Hand as a brainwashed assassin, she is tasked with killing Chaste members and anyone who can threaten their plans, running afoul of Danny Rand, Colleen Wing, and Jessica Jones in the process. When Murdock, Rand, Jones, and Luke Cage join forces to form the Defenders and combat the Hand, Elektra is sent to attack them, but is defeated by Rand. Following this, she slowly regains her memories, but kills Stick, kidnaps Rand, kills the Hand&#x27;s leader Alexandra Reid to assume control of the group, and manipulates Rand into helping her unearth ancient caverns filled with dragon skeletons said to contain the secret to eternal life. After the Defenders rescue Rand and set explosives in the Hand&#x27;s headquarters, Murdock stays behind to reach Elektra before they share a kiss and disappear in the explosion. While Murdock survives, Elektra&#x27;s fate is left ambiguous.

=== Film ===

* Elektra appears in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003), portrayed by Jennifer Garner. This version is the daughter of billionaire Nikolas Natchios, who had her trained in martial arts after she witnessed her mother&#x27;s death at a young age. In the present, she encounters and falls in love with Matt Murdock before witnessing Nikolas&#x27; death. Initially assuming Daredevil was the culprit, she attacks him, only to learn he is Murdock. Realizing Bullseye is her father&#x27;s killer, she confronts him, but is fatally stabbed, left for dead, and dies in Murdock&#x27;s arms.
** Elektra appears in a self-titled spin-off film (2005), portrayed again by Jennifer Garner. In this film, it is revealed that she was once a martial arts prodigy called the &quot;Treasure&quot;. Following her death, Stick resurrected her and trained her in Kimagure, which grants the practitioner precognition and the ability to resurrect the dead. Due to her rage and fear of seeing her mother&#x27;s killer however, she is expelled from Stick&#x27;s training compound and becomes a contract killer. Years later, she finds herself protecting a target she was meant to kill but became acquainted with, Mark Miller, and his daughter Abby Miller, the current &quot;Treasure&quot;, from the Hand.
** Following her previous film appearances, Elektra&#x27;s film rights reverted to Marvel Studios in 2014 and became available for use in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Garner would eventually reprise her role as Elektra in the MCU film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024).

<doc id="377390" wikidata="Q1033526" url="?curid=377390" title="Phonemic orthography">
<text>A phonemic orthography is an orthography (system for writing a language) in which the graphemes (written symbols) correspond consistently to the language&#x27;s phonemes (the smallest units of speech that can differentiate words), or more generally to the language&#x27;s diaphonemes. Natural languages rarely have perfectly phonemic orthographies; a high degree of grapheme–phoneme correspondence can be expected in orthographies based on alphabetic writing systems, but they differ in how complete this correspondence is. English orthography, for example, is alphabetic but highly nonphonemic.

In less formally precise terms, a language with a highly phonemic orthography may be described as having regular spelling or phonetic spelling. Another terminology is that of deep and shallow orthographies, in which the depth of an orthography is the degree to which it diverges from being truly phonemic. The concept can also be applied to nonalphabetic writing systems like syllabaries.

==Ideal phonemic orthography==
In an ideal phonemic orthography, there would be a complete one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the graphemes (letters) and the phonemes of the language, and each phoneme would invariably be represented by its corresponding grapheme. So the spelling of a word would unambiguously and transparently indicate its pronunciation, and conversely, a speaker knowing the pronunciation of a word would be able to infer its spelling without any doubt. That ideal situation is rare but exists in Serbo-Croatian.

==Deviations from phonemic orthography==
There are two distinct types of deviation from the phonemic ideal. In the first case, the exact one-to-one correspondence may be lost (for example, some phoneme may be represented by a digraph instead of a single letter), but the &quot;regularity&quot; is retained: there is still an algorithm (but a more complex one) for predicting the spelling from the pronunciation and vice versa. In the second case, true irregularity is introduced, as certain words come to be spelled and pronounced according to different rules from others, and prediction of spelling from pronunciation and vice versa is no longer possible.

===Case 1: Regular===
Pronunciation and spelling still correspond in a predictable way
*A phoneme may be represented by a sequence of letters, called a multigraph, rather than by a single letter (as in the case of the digraph &quot;ch&quot; in French and the trigraph &quot;sch&quot; in German), that retains predictability only if the multigraph cannot be broken down into smaller units. Some languages use diacritics to distinguish between a digraph and a sequence of individual letters, and others require knowledge of the language to distinguish them; compare &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; in English.

Examples:

&quot;sch&quot; versus &quot;s-ch&quot; in Romansch

&quot;ng&quot; versus &quot;n&quot; + &quot;g&quot; in Welsh

&quot;ch&quot; versus &quot;çh&quot; in Manx Gaelic: this is a slightly different case where the same digraph is used for two different single phonemes.

&quot;ai&quot; versus &quot;aï&quot; in French

This is often due to the use of an alphabet that was originally used for a different language (the Latin alphabet in these examples) and so does not have single letters available for all the phonemes used in the current language (although some orthographies use devices such as diacritics to increase the number of available letters).
*Sometimes, conversely, a single letter may represent a sequence of more than one phoneme (as &quot;x&quot; can represent the sequence /ks/ in English and other languages).
*Sometimes, the rules of correspondence are more complex and depend on adjacent letters, often as a result of historical sound changes (as with the rules for the pronunciation of &quot;ca&quot; and &quot;ci&quot; in Italian and the silent &quot;e&quot; in English).

===Case 2: Irregular===
Pronunciation and spelling do not always correspond in a predictable way
* Sometimes, different letters correspond to the same phoneme (for instance &quot;u&quot; and &quot;ó&quot; in Polish are both pronounced as the phoneme /u/). That is often for historical reasons (the Polish letters originally stood for different phonemes, which later merged phonologically). That affects the predictability of spelling from pronunciation but not necessarily vice versa. Another example is found in Modern Greek, whose phoneme /i/ can be written in six different ways: ι, η, υ, ει, οι and υι.
In Bengali, the letters, &#x27;শ&#x27;, &#x27;ষ&#x27;, and &#x27; স, correspond to the same sound //. Moreover, consonant clusters , &#x27;স্ব&#x27;, &#x27;স্য&#x27; , &#x27;শ্ব &#x27;, &#x27;শ্ম&#x27;, &#x27;শ্য&#x27;, &#x27;ষ্ম &#x27;, &#x27;ষ্য&#x27;, also often have the same pronunciation, // or //.
* Conversely, a letter or group of letters can correspond to different phonemes in different contexts. For example, &quot;th&quot; in English can represent /ð/ (as in &quot;this&quot;) or /θ/ (as in &quot;thin&quot;), as well as /th/ (as in &quot;goatherd&quot;).
*Spelling may otherwise represent a historical pronunciation; orthography does not necessarily keep up with sound changes in the spoken language. For example, both the &quot;k&quot; and the digraph &quot;gh&quot; of English &quot;knight&quot; were once pronounced (the latter is still pronounced in some Scots varieties), but after the loss of their sounds, they no longer represent the word&#x27;s phonemic structure or its pronunciation.
*Spelling may represent the pronunciation of a different dialect from the one being considered.
*Spellings of loanwords often adhere to or are influenced by the orthography of the source language (as with the English words &quot;ballet&quot; and &quot;fajita&quot;, from French and Spanish respectively). With some loanwords, though, regularity is retained either by 
** nativizing the pronunciation to match the spelling (as with the Russian word шофёр, from French &quot;chauffeur&quot; but pronounced in accordance with the normal rules of Russian vowel reduction; see also spelling pronunciation) or by 
** nativizing the spelling (for example, &quot;football&quot; is spelt &quot;fútbol&quot; in Spanish and &quot;futebol&quot; in Portuguese).
*Spelling may reflect a folk etymology (as in the English words &quot;hiccough&quot; and &quot;island&quot;, so spelt because of an imagined connection with the words &quot;cough&quot; and &quot;isle&quot;), or distant etymology (as in the English word &quot;debt&quot; in which the silent &quot;b&quot; was added under the influence of Latin).
* Spelling may reflect morphophonemic structure rather than the purely phonemic (see next section) although it is often also a reflection of historical pronunciation.

Most orthographies do not reflect the changes in pronunciation known as sandhi in which pronunciation is affected by adjacent sounds in neighboring words (written Sanskrit and other Indian languages, however, reflect such changes). A language may also use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items such as the Japanese hiragana and katakana syllabaries (and the different treatment in English orthography of words derived from Latin and Greek).

== Morphophonemic features ==
Alphabetic orthographies often have features that are morphophonemic rather than purely phonemic. This means that the spelling reflects to some extent the underlying morphological structure of the words, not only their pronunciation. Hence different forms of a morpheme (minimum meaningful unit of language) are often spelt identically or similarly in spite of differences in their pronunciation. That is often for historical reasons; the morphophonemic spelling reflects a previous pronunciation from before historical sound changes that caused the variation in pronunciation of a given morpheme. Such spellings can assist in the recognition of words when reading.

Some examples of morphophonemic features in orthography are described below.
*The English plural morpheme is written &quot;-s&quot; regardless of whether it is pronounced as or , e.g. &quot;cats and dogs, not &quot;cats and dogz. This is because the and sounds are forms of the same underlying morphophoneme, automatically pronounced differently depending on its environment. (However, when this morpheme takes the form , the addition of the vowel &quot;is&quot; reflected in the spelling: &quot;churches, &quot;masses.)
*Similarly the English past tense morpheme is written &quot;-ed&quot; regardless of whether it is pronounced as , or (with some exceptions: , ).
*Many English words retain spellings that reflect their etymology and morphology rather than their present-day pronunciation. For example, &quot;sign&quot; and &quot;signature&quot; include the spelling , which means the same but is pronounced differently in the two words. Other examples are science&quot; vs. &quot;conscience&quot; , prejudice&quot; vs. prequel&quot; , nation&quot; vs. nationalism&quot; , and special&quot; vs. &quot;species&quot; .
*Phonological assimilation is often not reflected in spelling even in otherwise phonemic orthographies such as Spanish, in which &quot;obtener&quot; &quot;obtain&quot; and &quot;optimista&quot; &quot;optimist&quot; are written with &quot;b&quot; and &quot;p&quot;, but are commonly neutralized with regard to voicing and pronounced in various ways, such as both [β] in neutral style or both [p] in emphatic pronunciation. On the other hand, Serbo-Croatian (Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin) spelling reflects assimilation so one writes &quot;Србија/Srbija&quot; &quot;Serbia&quot; but &quot;српски/srpski&quot; &quot;Serbian&quot;.
*The final-obstruent devoicing that occurs in many languages (such as German, Polish and Russian) is not normally reflected in the spelling. For example, in German, &quot;Bad&quot; &quot;bath&quot; is spelt with a final even though it is pronounced , thus corresponding to other morphologically related forms such as the verb &quot;baden&quot; (bathe) in which the &quot;d&quot; is pronounced . (Compare &#x27;, &#x27; (&quot;advice&quot;, &quot;advise&quot;) in which the &quot;t&quot; is pronounced in both positions.) Turkish orthography, however, is more strictly phonemic: for example, the imperative of &quot;eder&quot; &quot;does&quot; is spelled &quot;et&quot;, as it is pronounced (and the same as the word for &quot;meat&quot;), not &quot;*ed&quot;, as it would be if German spelling were used.

Korean &quot;hangul&quot; has changed over the centuries from a highly phonemic to a largely morphophonemic orthography. Japanese kana are almost completely phonemic but have a few morphophonemic aspects, notably in the use of ぢ &quot;di&quot; and づ &quot;du&quot; (rather than じ &quot;ji&quot; and ず &quot;zu&quot;, their pronunciation in standard Tokyo dialect), when the character is a voicing of an underlying ち or つ. That is from the rendaku sound change combined with the yotsugana merger of formally different morae. The Russian orthography is also mostly morphophonemic, because it does not reflect vowel reduction, consonant assimilation and final-obstruent devoicing. Also, some consonant combinations have silent consonants.

==Defective orthographies==
A defective orthography is one that is not capable of representing all the phonemes or phonemic distinctions in a language. An example of such a deficiency in English orthography is the lack of distinction between the voiced and voiceless &quot;th&quot; phonemes ( and , respectively), occurring in words like &quot;this&quot; (voiced) and &quot;thin&quot; (voiceless) respectively, with both written .

== Comparison between languages ==

Languages whose current orthographies have a high grapheme-to-phoneme and phoneme-to-grapheme correspondence (excluding exceptions due to loan words and assimilation) include:
*Afrikaans
*Amharic
*Arabic (with diacritics, apart from ى and assimilation of -ال)
*Kurdish
*Maltese
*Estonian (apart from palatalization or long and &quot;over-long&quot; phoneme length distinction)
*Finnish
*Albanian
*Georgian
*Hindi (apart from schwa deletion)
*Italian
*Sanskrit
*Kannada
*Telugu
*Malayalam
*Dhivehi 
*Turkish (apart from &quot;ğ&quot; and various palatal and vowel allophones)
*Serbo-Croatian (Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin; written in either Cyrillic or Latin script)
*Slovenian
*Bulgarian
*Macedonian (if the apostrophe denoting schwa is counted, though slight inconsistencies may be found)
*Eastern Armenian (apart from &quot;o&quot;, &quot;v&quot;)
*Basque (apart from palatalized &quot;l&quot;, &quot;n&quot;)
*Haitian Creole
*Spanish (apart from &quot;h&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;b&quot;/&quot;v&quot;, and sometimes &quot;k&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;z&quot;)
*Czech (apart from &quot;ě&quot;, &quot;ů&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;ý&quot;)
*Slovak (apart from &quot;de&quot;, &quot;te&quot;, &quot;ne&quot;, &quot;di&quot;, &quot;ti&quot;, &quot;ni&quot;)
*Polish (apart from &quot;ó&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;rz&quot; and nasal vowels &quot;ą&quot; and &quot;ę&quot;)
*Romanian (apart from &quot;â&quot; or &quot;î&quot; (see Î versus Â))
*Ukrainian (mainly phonemic with some other historical/morphological rules, as well as palatalization)
*Belarusian (phonemic for vowels but mostly morphophonemic for consonants except &quot;ў&quot; written phonetically)
*Swahili (missing aspirated consonants, which do not occur in all varieties and anyway are sparsely used)
*Mongolian (Cyrillic) (apart from letters representing multiple sounds depending on front or back vowels, the soft and hard sign, silent letters to indicate from and voiced versus voiceless consonants)
*Azerbaijani (apart from &quot;k&quot;)
*Hungarian (apart from &quot;j&quot; and &quot;ly&quot;)
*Oromo
*Malay and Indonesian (apart from &quot;e&quot; and various vowel allophones, as well as &quot;k&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; if an Arabic-style pronunciation is followed)
==Realignment of orthography==
With time, pronunciations change and spellings become out of date, as has happened to English and French. In order to maintain a phonemic orthography such a system would need periodic updating, as has been attempted by various language regulators and proposed by other spelling reformers.

Sometimes the pronunciation of a word changes to match its spelling; this is called a spelling pronunciation. This is most common with loanwords, but occasionally occurs in the case of established native words too.

In some English personal names and place names, the relationship between the spelling of the name and its pronunciation is so distant that associations between phonemes and graphemes cannot be readily identified. Moreover, in many other words, the pronunciation has subsequently evolved from a fixed spelling, so that it has to be said that the phonemes represent the graphemes rather than vice versa. And in much technical jargon, the primary medium of communication is the written language rather than the spoken language, so the phonemes represent the graphemes, and it is unimportant how the word is pronounced. Moreover, the sounds which literate people perceive being heard in a word are significantly influenced by the actual spelling of the word.

Sometimes, countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when Turkey switched from the Arabic alphabet to the Latin-based Turkish alphabet.

== Phonetic transcription ==

Methods for phonetic transcription such as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) aim to describe pronunciation in a standard form. They are often used to solve ambiguities in the spelling of written language. They may also be used to write languages with no previous written form. Systems like IPA can be used for phonemic representation or for showing more detailed phonetic information (see Narrow vs. broad transcription).

Phonemic orthographies are different from phonetic transcription; whereas in a phonemic orthography, allophones will usually be represented by the same grapheme, a purely phonetic script would demand that phonetically distinct allophones be distinguished. To take an example from American English: the phoneme in the words &quot;table&quot; and &quot;cat&quot; would, in both a phonemic orthography and in IPA phonemic transcription, be written with the same character, while phonetic transcription would make a distinction between the aspirated &quot;t&quot; in &quot;table&quot;, the flap in &quot;butter&quot;, the unaspirated &quot;t&quot; in &quot;stop&quot; and the glottalized &quot;t&quot; in &quot;cat&quot; (not all these allophones exist in all English dialects). In other words, the sound that most English speakers think of as is really a group of sounds, all pronounced slightly differently depending on where they occur in a word. A perfectly phonemic orthography has one letter per group of sounds (phoneme), with different letters only where the sounds distinguish words (so &quot;bed&quot; is spelled differently from &quot;bet&quot;).

A phonetic transcription represents phones, the sounds humans are capable of producing, many of which will often be grouped together as a single phoneme in any given natural language, though the groupings vary across languages. English, for example, does not distinguish phonemically between aspirated and unaspirated consonants, but other languages, like Korean, Bengali and Hindi do.

The sounds of speech of all languages of the world can be written by a rather small universal phonetic alphabet. A standard for this is the International Phonetic Alphabet.

<text>The American lobster (Homarus americanus) is a species of lobster found on the Atlantic coast of North America, chiefly from Labrador to New Jersey. It is also known as Atlantic lobster, Canadian lobster, true lobster, northern lobster, Canadian Reds, or Maine lobster. It can reach a body length of , and a mass of over , making it not only the heaviest crustacean in the world, but also the heaviest of all living arthropod species. Its closest relative is the European lobster &quot;Homarus gammarus&quot;, which can be distinguished by its coloration and the lack of spines on the underside of the rostrum. American lobsters are usually bluish green to brown with red spines, but several color variations have been observed.

&quot;Homarus americanus&quot; is distributed along the Atlantic coast of North America, from Labrador in the north to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, in the south. South of New Jersey, the species is uncommon, and landings in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina usually make up less than 0.1% of all landings. A fossil claw assigned to &quot;Homarus americanus&quot; was found at Nantucket, dating from the Pleistocene. In 2013, an American lobster was caught at the Farallon Islands off the coast of California. It has been introduced to Norway and potentially Iceland.

==Description==

&quot;Homarus americanus&quot; commonly reaches long and weighs in weight, but has been known to weigh as much as , making this the heaviest crustacean in the world. Together with &quot;Sagmariasus verreauxi&quot;, it is also the longest decapod crustacean in the world; an average adult is about long and weighs . The longest American lobsters have a body (excluding claws) long. According to Guinness World Records, the heaviest crustacean ever recorded was an American lobster caught off Nova Scotia, Canada, weighing .

The closest relative of &quot;H. americanus&quot; is the European lobster, &quot;Homarus gammarus&quot;. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by several characteristics:
*The rostrum of &quot;H. americanus&quot; bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in &quot;H. gammarus&quot;.
*The spines on the claws of &quot;H. americanus&quot; are red or red-tipped, while those of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; are white or white-tipped.
*The underside of the claw of &quot;H. americanus&quot; is orange or red, while that of &quot;H. gammarus&quot; is creamy white or very pale red.

===Head===
The antennae measure about long and split into Y-shaped structures with pointed tips. Each tip exhibits a dense zone of hair tufts staggered in a zigzag arrangement. These hairs are covered with multiple nerve cells that can detect odors. Larger, thicker hairs found along the edges control the flow of water, containing odor molecules, to the inner sensory hairs. The shorter antennules provide a further sense of smell. By having a pair of olfactory organs, a lobster can locate the direction a smell comes from, much the same way humans can hear the direction a sound comes from. In addition to sensing smells, the antennules can judge water speed to improve direction finding.

Lobsters have two urinary bladders, located on either side of the head. Lobsters use scents to communicate what and where they are, and those scents are in the urine. They project long plumes of urine in front of them, and do so when they detect a rival or a potential mate in the area.

===Thorax===
The first pair of pereiopods (legs) is armed with a large, asymmetric pair of claws. The larger one is the &quot;crusher&quot;, and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the &quot;cutter&quot; or &quot;gripper&quot;, which has sharp inner edges and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Whether the crusher claw is on the left side or right side of its body determines whether a lobster is left or right &quot;handed&quot;.

===Coloration===
The normal coloration of &quot;Homarus americanus&quot; is bluish green to brown with red spines due to a mixture of yellow, blue, and red pigments that occur naturally in the shell. On rare occasions these colors are distorted due to genetic mutations or conditions creating a spectacle for those who catch them. In 2012 it was reported that there has been an increase in these &quot;rare&quot; catches due to unclear reasons. Social media influence making reporting and sharing more accessible to a drop in predator populations have been suggested as possible reasons. The lobsters mentioned below thus usually receive media coverage due to their rarity and eye appeal.

==Life cycle==

Mating only takes place shortly after the female has molted and her exoskeleton is still soft. The female releases a pheromone which causes the males to become less aggressive and to begin courtship, which involves a courtship dance with claws closed. Eventually, the male inserts spermatophores (sperm packets) into the female&#x27;s seminal receptacle using his first pleopods; the female may store the sperm for up to 15 months.

The female releases eggs through her oviducts, and they pass the seminal receptacle and are fertilized by the stored sperm. They are then attached to the female&#x27;s pleopods (swimmerets) using an adhesive, where they are cared for until they are ready to hatch. The female cleans the eggs regularly and fans them with water to keep them oxygenated. The large telolecithal eggs may resemble the segments of a raspberry, and a female carrying eggs is said to be &quot;in berry&quot;. Since this period lasts 10–11 months, berried females can be found at any time of year. In the waters off New England, the eggs are typically laid in July or August, and hatch the following May or June. The developing embryo passes through several molts within the egg, before hatching as a metanauplius larva. When the eggs hatch, the female releases them by waving her tail in the water, setting batches of larvae free.
The metanauplius of &quot;H. americanus&quot; is long, transparent, with large eyes and a long spine projecting from its head. It quickly molts, and the next three stages are similar, but larger. These molts take 10–20 days, during which the planktonic larvae are vulnerable to predation; only 1 in 1,000 is thought to survive to the juvenile stage. To reach the fourth stage – the post-larva – the larva undergoes metamorphosis, and subsequently shows a much greater resemblance to the adult lobster, is around long, and swims with its pleopods. At this stage, the lobster&#x27;s claws are still relatively small so they rely primarily on tail-flip escapes if threatened.

After the next molt, the lobster sinks to the ocean floor and adopts a benthic lifestyle. It molts more and more infrequently, from an initial rate of ten times per year to once every few years. After one year it is around long, and after six years it may weigh . By the time it reaches the minimum landing size, an individual may have molted 25–27 times, and thereafter each molt may signal a 40%–50% increase in weight, and a 14% increase in carapace length. If threatened, adult lobsters will generally choose to fight unless they have lost their claws.

== Ecology ==
The American lobster thrives in cold, shallow waters where there are many rocks and other places to hide from predators. It typically lives at a depth of , but can be found up to below the surface.

===Diet===
The natural diet of &quot;H. americanus&quot; is relatively consistent across different habitats. It is dominated by mollusks (especially mussels, clams and snails), echinoderms and polychaetes, although a wide range of other prey items may be eaten, including other crustaceans (such as crabs), brittle stars, cnidarians and small fish. It will also feed on dead animals, as well as algae and eelgrass. Since lobsters sometimes eat their own molted shell, they were thought to be cannibalistic, but this has never been recorded in the wild. Lobsters in Maine have been shown to gain 35–55% of their calories from herring, which is used as bait for lobster traps. Only 6% of lobsters entering lobster traps to feed are caught.

===Diseases===

====Bacterial====
Gaffkaemia or red-tail is an extremely virulent infectious disease of lobsters caused by the bacterium &quot;Aerococcus viridans&quot;. It only requires a few bacterial cells to cause death of otherwise healthy lobsters. The &quot;red tail&quot; common name refers to a dark orange discoloration of the ventral abdomen of affected lobsters. This is, in fact, the hemolymph or blood seen through the thin ventral arthrodial membranes. The red discoloration comes from astaxanthin, a carotenoid pigment exported to the blood during times of stress. The same sign is also seen in other diseases of lobsters and appears to be a nonspecific stress response, possibly relating to the antioxidant and immunostimulatory properties of the astaxanthin molecule.

Epizootic shell disease is a bacterial infection which causes black lesions on the lobsters&#x27; dorsal carapaces, reducing their saleability and sometimes killing the lobsters.

Limp lobster disease caused by systemic infection by the bacterium &quot;Vibrio fluvialis&quot; (or similar species) causes lobsters to become lethargic and die.

====Parasitic====
Paramoebiasis is an infectious disease of lobsters caused by infection with the sarcomastigophoran (amoeba) &quot;Neoparamoeba pemaquidensis&quot;. This organism also causes amoebic gill disease in farmed Atlantic salmon, &quot;Salmo salar&quot;. Infection occurs throughout the tissues, causing granuloma-like lesions, especially within the ventral nerve cord, the interstices of the hepatopancreas and the antennal gland. Paramoebiasis is strongly suspected to play a prominent role in the rapid die-off of American lobsters in Long Island Sound that occurred in the summer of 1999.

====Environmental====
Excretory calcinosis in American lobsters in Long Island Sound was described in 2002. The disease causes mineralized calculi to form in the antennal glands and gills. These cause a loss of surface area around the gills, and the lobster eventually asphyxiates. Several reasons have been proposed for the cause of a recent outbreak of the disease. The most generally attributed factor is an increased duration of warmer temperatures in the bottom of the Long Island Sound.

Plastic pollution is harmful for American lobsters. Consumption of microplastic particles may be deadly to early-stage larvae. For later stage larvae, oxygen consumption rate decreases with high level of microplastic fibers.

==Taxonomy==
The American lobster was first described by Thomas Say in 1817, with a type locality of &quot;Long-branch, part of the coast of New Jersey&quot;. The name Say chose – &quot;Astacus marinus&quot; – was invalid as a junior homonym of &quot;Astacus marinus&quot; Fabricius, 1775, which is in turn a junior synonym of &quot;Homarus gammarus&quot;. The American lobster was given its current scientific name of &quot;Homarus americanus&quot; by Henri Milne-Edwards in his 1837 work &quot;&quot; (&quot;Natural History of the Crustacea&quot;). The common name preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is &quot;American lobster&quot;, but the species is also known locally as the &quot;northern lobster&quot;, &quot;Maine lobster&quot; or simply &quot;lobster&quot;.

==As food==
American lobsters are a popular food. They are commonly boiled or steamed. Hard-shells (lobsters that are several months past their last molt) can survive out of water for up to four or five days if kept refrigerated. Soft-shells (lobsters that have only recently molted) do not survive more than a few hours out of water. Lobsters are usually cooked alive, which may be illegal in certain areas and which some people consider inhumane.

Boiling lobsters has been banned in several jurisdictions, including Switzerland, New Zealand, and parts of Italy. Boiling has been deemed to cause “extreme suffering” in lobsters, who continue to show intense brain activity for 30 to 150 seconds after immersion in boiling water. Slowly raising the water temperature may also cause pain in crustaceans over a longer period of time.

Lobster &#x27;tail&#x27; (actually the abdomen) is sometimes served with beef as surf and turf. Lobsters have a greenish or brownish organ called the tomalley, which, like the liver and pancreas in a human, filters out toxins from the body. Some diners consider it a delicacy, but others avoid it because they consider it a toxin source; dislike eating innards; or are put off by its texture and appearance, that of a grainy greenish paste.

A set of nutcrackers and a long, thin tool for pulling meat from inaccessible areas are suggested as basics, although more experienced diners can eat the animal with their bare hands or a simple tool (a fork, knife or rock). Eating a lobster can get messy, and most restaurants offer a lobster bib. Meat is generally contained in the larger claws and tails, and stays warm quite a while after being served. There is some meat in the legs and in the arms that connect the large claws to the body. There is also some small amount of meat just below the carapace around the thorax and in the smaller legs.

=== Recognition of the sentience of North American lobsters ===
A 2021 London School of Economics report found strong evidence to suggest that lobsters can experience pain. Dr Jonathan Birch, Principal Investigator on the project, said, &quot;After reviewing over 300 scientific studies, we concluded that cephalopod molluscs and decapod crustaceans should be regarded as sentient, and should therefore be included within the scope of animal welfare law.”

Following the report, octopuses, crabs and lobsters are now protected under stronger animal welfare legislation in the UK (under the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill).

===North American lobster industry===

Most lobsters come from the northeastern coast of North America, with the Atlantic Provinces of Canada and the U.S. state of Maine being the largest producers. They are caught primarily using lobster traps, although lobsters are also harvested as bycatch by bottom trawlers, fishermen using gillnets, and by scuba divers in some areas. Maine prohibits scuba divers from catching lobsters; violations are punishable by fines of up to $1000. Maine also prohibits the landing of lobsters caught by bottom trawlers and other &quot;mobile gear&quot;. Massachusetts offers scuba divers lobster licenses for a fee, and they are only available to state residents. Rhode Island also requires divers to acquire a permit.

Lobster traps are rectangular cages made of vinyl-coated galvanized steel mesh or wood, with woven mesh entrances. These are baited and lowered to the sea floor. They allow a lobster to enter, but make it difficult for the larger specimens to turn around and exit. This allows the creatures to be captured alive. The traps, sometimes referred to as &quot;pots&quot;, have a buoy floating on the surface, and lobstermen check their traps between one and seven days after setting them. The inefficiency of the trapping system has inadvertently prevented the lobster population from being overfished. Lobsters can easily escape the trap, and will defend the trap against other lobsters because it is a source of food. An estimated 10% of lobsters that encounter a trap enter, and of those that enter 6% will be caught.

==== United States ====
In the United States, the lobster industry is regulated. Every lobster fisher is required to use a lobster gauge to measure the distance from the lobster&#x27;s eye socket to the end of its carapace: if the lobster is less than long, it is too young to be sold and must be released back to the sea. There is also a legal maximum size of in Maine, meant to ensure the survival of a healthy breeding stock of adult males, but in parts of some states, such as Massachusetts, there is none. Also, traps must contain an escape hole or &quot;vent&quot;, which allows juvenile lobsters and bycatch species to escape. The law in Maine and other states dictates a second large escape hole or &quot;ghost panel&quot; must be installed. This hole is held shut through use of degradable clips made of ferrous metal. Should the trap become lost, the trap eventually opens, allowing the catch to escape.

To protect known breeding females, lobsters caught carrying eggs are to be notched on a tail flipper (second from the right, if the lobster is right-side up and the tail is fully extended). Following this, the female cannot be kept or sold, and is commonly referred to as a &quot;punch-tail&quot; or as &quot;v-notched&quot;. This notch remains for two molts of the lobster exoskeleton, providing harvest protection and continued breeding availability for up to five years.

====Canada====
In Canada, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for the governance of fisheries under the authority of the Fisheries Act. The governance structure also includes various other acts, regulations, orders and policies. American Lobster is fished in Canada by lobster licence holders hailing from ports located in provinces on Canada&#x27;s east coast. Lobster is Canada&#x27;s most valuable seafood export, worth over CAD$2 billion in 2016.

===Management===
American lobster tends to have a stable stock in colder northern waters, but gradually decreases in abundance moving southward. To manage lobster populations, more regulations and restrictions, geared towards achieving sustainable populations, are implemented gradually southward.

== Genetics ==
Currently there is no published genome for the American lobster, although a transcriptome was published in 2016.

<text>MiNT (MiNT is Now TOS) is a free software alternative operating system kernel for the Atari ST series. It is a multi-tasking alternative to TOS and MagiC. Together with the free system components fVDI device drivers, XaAES graphical user interface widgets, and TeraDesk file manager, MiNT provides a free TOS compatible replacement OS that can multitask.

== History ==
Work on MiNT began in 1989, as the developer Eric Smith was trying to port the GNU library and related utilities on the Atari ST TOS. It soon became much easier to add a Unix-like layer to the TOS, than to patch all of the GNU software, and MiNT began as a TOS extension to help in porting.

MiNT was originally released by Eric Smith as &quot;MiNT is Not TOS&quot; (a recursive acronym in the style of &quot;GNU&#x27;s Not Unix&quot;) in May 1990. The new Kernel got traction, with people contributing a port of the MINIX file system and a port to the Atari TT.

At the same time, Atari was looking to enhance the TOS with multitasking abilities. MiNT could fulfill the job, and Atari hired Eric Smith. MiNT was adopted as an official alternative kernel with the release of the Atari Falcon, slightly altering the MiNT acronym into &quot;MiNT is Now TOS&quot;. Atari bundled MiNT with a multitasking version of the Graphics Environment Manager (GEM) under the name MultiTOS as a floppy disk based installer.

After Atari left the computer market, MiNT development continued as FreeMiNT, and became maintained by a team of volunteers. FreeMiNT development follows a classic open-source approach, with the source code hosted on a publicly browsable FreeMiNT Git repository on GitHub and development discussed in a public mailing list., which is maintained on SourceForge, after an earlier (2014) move from AtariForge, where it was maintained for almost 20 years.

== MiNT software ecosystem ==
FreeMiNT provides only a kernel, so several distributions support MiNT, like VanillaMint, EasyMint, STMint, and BeeKey/BeePi.

Although FreeMiNT can use the graphical user interface of the TOS (the Graphics Environment Manager GEM and the Application Environment Services or AES), it is better served with an enhanced AES which can use its multi-tasking abilities.

The default one is currently XaAES, which is developed as a FreeMiNT kernel module. The older N.AES also works, however the modern alternative is MyAES.

Michelle Monique Reis (born 20 June 1970) is a Macanese and Hong Kong former actress, model and beauty pageant titleholder. In 1988, she won the Miss Chinese International Pageant and Miss Hong Kong beauty pageants. Afterwards, she became a prominent actress in 1990s Hong Kong, often appearing in introspective and independent fare rather than mainstream releases.

Reis often played dynamic characters, with a significant number of her roles centering around characters deemed more &quot;difficult&quot; to portray in Hong Kong cinema, such as prostitutes, femme fatales, and professional killers. Known for her youthful beauty and often deemed &quot;one of the most beautiful women in Asia&quot;, Reis has continued to remain in the public eye long after her film career subsided in the early 2000s. Outside of the Chinese-speaking world, she is most famous for her role as the Hitman&#x27;s Assistant in &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1995), which brought her critical acclaim internationally, as well as status as a cult film character and saw her nominated for “Best Actress&quot; at the 1996 Golden Bauhinia Awards.

==Early life==
Reis was born in Macau, then a Portuguese colony, on 20 June 1970 as Michele Monique Reis. She did not acquire her Chinese name, Lee Ka Yan or Li Jiaxin (李嘉欣), until after elementary school. She is of mixed ancestry; her father, Francis Reis, was a Hong Kong-born ethnically Portuguese Macanese, and her mother, Wu Guofang (Chinese: 吴国芳), is Chinese and was raised in Shanghai before moving to British Hong Kong after World War II. Reis also has an older sister, born in August 1962, known as &quot;Yuet Chi&quot; (Joanna Francisca Reis or Li Jiaming; 李嘉明). 

Her father, a member of the Hong Kong Volunteers, was captured by the Japanese when defending Hong Kong in 1941 during World War II and was imprisoned by the Imperial Japanese Army in the Sham Shui Po Barracks for two years. Francis was reportedly popular and well-liked by the other prisoners. Still, because of his height, he was sent to work in coal mines in Sendai, Japan, until Japan&#x27;s surrender. After the liberation of Hong Kong in 1945, he returned to Hong Kong, married Michelle&#x27;s mother, and entered a business career.

In 1973, a modeling scout discovered Reis, and she was subsequently shot in a one-time baby advertisement.

Reis recalls her childhood as an unhappy one. She recalls her childhood being devoid of toys or new clothes and dominated by &quot;her mother&#x27;s tears and parents&#x27; endless bickering&quot;. Her father became more absent, resulting in Reis being raised primarily by her mother. Francis Reis was unsuccessful in his career, &quot;achieving nothing&quot;, resulting in the family living in poverty. Wu Guofang, Reis&#x27; mother, worked two jobs a day to provide for the family. The family lived in a tin roof house, which they built themselves and was typical of Hong Kong&#x27;s impoverished, and then lived in the highly dense and impoverished Chungking Mansions. Conditions at the tin roof house were very poor, with summers being extremely hot and rain easily dripping through cracks in their roof.

In 1982, when she was 12, Reis filmed a second advertisement.

At 14, she began part-time studies as a student, which her mother emphasised, completing these studies by modelling part-time. By the time she entered the 1988 Miss Hong Kong Pageant, she had already appeared in more than 70 advertisements. During her studies, modelling scouts offered her casting and commercial film opportunities, but Reis declined as she wanted to be a flight attendant. Reis attended Maryknoll Convent School and matriculated from St. Paul&#x27;s Secondary School throughout her studies. At Maryknoll Convent School, she received excellent grades, with 2A (English, Bible) results and ranking 7B in the five-year secondary education graduation exam. 

Many years after Reis&#x27; father abandoned the family and as Reis began to become well-known in Hong Kong, he tried to contact Reis by phone, asking for money. Despite her worries about his deteriorating health, she had no intention of reconnecting. Years later, Reis recalled the phone call, which she found hurtful. Reis’ father died at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong on 22 August 1995 after fighting a blood disorder for eight months. She attended his funeral.

==Career==
=== Beauty queen career and early actress career (1988–1993) ===
In 1988, after encouragement from others, Reis auditioned for the 1988 Miss Hong Kong Pageant. She was predicted to win the &quot;Best Photogenic Award&quot;, which gave Reis the self-confidence to continue on this career path. However, Sheila Chin won the &quot;Best Photogenic Award&quot; instead. She reportedly cried after leaving the stage. However, her mother&#x27;s words reminded Reis that the road to success was difficult and that there would be many setbacks in the future on this career path, which proved highly influential and inspirational to Reis, encouraging her to press ahead with the Miss Hong Kong Pageant. The competition between Reis and Sheila Chin was tense in the pageant and was &quot;neck-to-neck&quot;. Reis won the pageant, becoming Miss Hong Kong 1988 at the age of 18 and winning the contest&#x27;s &quot;Miss International Goodwill&quot; title. While both women would soon receive entertainment careers, with both taking a direction towards acting, Reis would, by the mid-1990s, ultimately become a more acclaimed celebrity than Chin, with distinctive film roles. Later that year, in late 1988, Reis would also become the first Miss Chinese International and was awarded the &quot;Best Photogenic Award&quot;. Following her Miss Chinese International crowning, she participated in the Miss World 1988 pageant in London, where she promoted the image of Hong Kong. Continuing her newfound status as an acclaimed beauty queen, Reis was then supposed to compete in the Miss Universe 1989 pageant but withdrew due to health problems, citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;.   

Reis would later reveal in 1998 that her beauty queen career proved to be a difficult time for her, stating: “The Miss Hong Kong time was very confusing for me. I wouldn’t have the courage to do it again.” After spending a year as the &quot;Miss International Goodwill&quot; Ambassador, a title she received from the Miss Hong Kong 1988 pageant, Reis later remarked that she &quot;wasn’t sure what I would do after it.&quot; As is customary for many Miss Hong Kong winners, Reis would receive a career offer from TVB – with Mona Fong, the Deputy chairman and general manager of TVB, personally stepping forward and trying her best to persuade Reis to sign a contract. Fong offered Reis very favourable conditions, such as not pushing Reis to star in the TV station&#x27;s low budget series, which is what usually happens with new, young faces in TVB, as well as offering Reis more beyond a normal monthly salary. As such, Reis soon appeared in a 5-episode TVB drama series called “I Do I Do” (花月佳期), which aired in late March 1989. While the drama is fairly unremarkable, it marked the first acting role of Reis, who had had no formal acting training when she was offered a contract by TVB, and later remarked that filming the series &quot;seemed like the right thing to do.&quot; In 1990, having first worked in commercials, appearing in music videos and then on TVB television episodes, Reis made her formal entry into showbiz with her first film roles such as &quot;Declaration Of Help&quot; (1990) – her film debut – and although a newcomer to films, played a role such as the &quot;rebel sister&quot; Yuet Chi / Moon in her second film, A Chinese Ghost Story Part II (1990). That year, she would also go on to star in comedies like &quot;No Risk, No Gain&quot; (1990), starring as Winnie, and as a streetwise tough beauty in &quot;Perfect Girls&quot; (1990). Her next films, in the years 1990–1993 would mostly be comedies, and she would often play roles dependent on her beauty. As such, she would to some degree cultivate an idol image, starring in popular films such as The Banquet (1991), Royal Tramp II (1992), and replacing Cecilia Yip in starring as the tomboyish disciple Kiddo in Swordsman II (1992) – starring alongside her favourite actress Brigitte Lin. Reis would also star in A Kid from Tibet (1992). However, Reis also starred in some roles in this early part of her acting career that would distinctly represent her acting style, and bring her out as an actress. These included starring as &quot;Windy&quot; in the anime-inspired, science-fiction future noir The Wicked City (1992), where her full-mouthed looks were deemed just right for the anime-inspired film, and her performance as an actress was brought out significantly in a way previously not before. Telling a story of conflicts and relationship between demon-like creatures and humans in 1990s Hong Kong, the film was a big success, being one of the most popular Tsui Hark productions in the USA and Europe, and still playing in festivals and midnight screenings around the USA and Europe. Reis would also dominate the film&#x27;s promotional material.

=== Actress breakthrough (1993–1995) ===
By the dawn of the mid-1990s however, most of Reis’ film roles, with the exception of a few notable, acclaimed roles, had been relatively undemanding, being mainly known for her minor girl-next-door, &quot;nice girl&quot; roles, and she was often only used for simply window dressing, a common phenomenon amongst good-looking talents in Hong Kong&#x27;s entertainment industry. Ambitious and wishing to attempt further, more elaborate roles with greater complexity, such as successful women, women with sex appeal, editresses or &quot;mad women&quot;, Reis expanded the scope of her acting career significantly from 1993. Starring in Jet Li’s movie &quot;The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk&quot; (1993), she starred as the beautiful Ting-Ting. The film was a box office hit and Reis then starred in its sequel released later that year, &quot;Fong Sai-Yuk II&quot; (1993). Moving into television, Reis began to increase the complexity of her roles as she so desired, starring as the beautiful and deceptive top agent of a doomsday cult in the cross-genre TVB drama &quot;The Legendary Ranger&quot; (1993) alongside her good friend Leon Lai. The drama&#x27;s eclectic setting and merger of wuxia, science fiction and fantasy genres, as well as its visual aesthetic was considered at the time groundbreaking in Hong Kong, and the demented mixture of beauty and darkness in the acting material Reis worked with cemented her signature acting style. In &quot;The Black Morning Glory&quot; (1993), Reis was to establish her acting style a step further – playing a complex dual-role as a professional killer employed by the Japanese yakuza. The film also dealt into the mental complexity of Reis’ character, with a drama-based storyline that sees her character fend off the police and yakuza while also attempting to reconcile with her own turmoil after she realises who she has killed. The film would then go on to serve as premise for Reis starring in &quot;The Other Side of the Sea&quot; (1994), where Reis would again portray a cold-blooded professional killer who must reckon with going on the run and betrayal after becoming disillusioned with a life of killing.

By 1995, Reis would star again alongside Leon Lai; this time in Wong Kar-wai’s neo-noir crime thriller &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; (1995), playing a sexually frustrated, jealous, cold-blooded hitman&#x27;s assistant. Reis’ character was a notable departure from her earlier roles, allowing herself to be filmed at fisheye lens angles, in grungy colours and with an appearance that was glamorously-dressed, stylish, and decidedly grunge, an appearance that would become emblematic of Reis’ style, but at times also dishevelled in contrast to the polished appearance of her Miss Hong Kong days. Reis’ character was described as a &quot;chain-smoking, quivering, obsessive mess who faxes kill-plans and masturbates in PVC fetish dresses&quot;, and was also interpreted as a ironic depiction of supermodel glamour or MTV music videos. Fully declaring herself as an actress, and breaking away completely from any kind of innocent or clean-cut image in a way that likely shocked many of her fans, Reis received critical acclaim for her portrayal of the role and immediately established herself as an A-list actress, becoming amongst Hong Kong&#x27;s most famous actresses. &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; would go on to become a cult classic of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of Hong Kong cinema, and Reis’ film character would also become a cult film character and a grunge icon – a reputation Reis has continued to have to this day. The role would also establish Reis as having fame beyond the Chinese-speaking world, becoming her most well-known role outside of the Chinese-speaking world. The role has often been called as the “bravest film choice&quot; in Reis’ film career, marking a moment where she began to build a reputation for starring in introspective and high-quality movies, and by far her most iconic role – it has also been called her &quot;very best performance&quot;.

=== Continued film and modelling success (1995-early 2000s) ===
After the success of &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;, Reis’ film output began to decrease, with only 8 films over the next 5 years, representing how she was only willing to only star in higher-quality movies with more challenging film roles, though she continued to pick up large success in her modelling work. In 1996, she modelled for cinematographer Christopher Doyle’s art book &quot;Angel Talk&quot;, which built on her grunge image. That same year, she starred as Laura in &quot;July&quot; &quot;13th&quot; (1996), a horror film about mental problems, suicide, and sleepless pressure in the chaos of Hong Kong city life. In 1997, Reis starred in the action sci-fi mystery thriller &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1997) as Adele, Andy Lau’s character&#x27;s dead fiancé. The film was visually and thematically a departure from many other works in Hong Kong cinema at the time, and she also starred in &quot;Young And Dangerous IV&quot; (1997), the fourth film in the hugely-popular &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; series of films. In 1998, Reis starred as the ambitious prostitute Emerald in the arthouse film Flowers of Shanghai. The role is Reis’ personal favourite of all her acting roles and she was the only member of the cast to fluently speak Shanghainese. Afterwards, she starred in the Japanese action film The City of Lost Souls in 2000, her last major film role. During the late 1990s, Reis’ career was also taking her abroad for further success – Reis was so popular in Japan that she was able to pick up &quot;millions&quot; from a day&#x27;s work of working in Tokyo, and she was also doing a lot of advertising work in Los Angeles.

Around the beginning of the 2000s, Reis began to withdraw from acting to focus on family and charity businesses whilst making occasional public appearances. Her last role to date was 2009&#x27;s &quot;Bodyguards and Assassins&quot;.

On 25 December 2021, Reis made an appearance as a guest/main judge on HK Television Entertainment&#x27;s fourth season of the talent variety show King Maker (Chinese: 全民造星IV), sparking internet discussion and hype.

==Personal life==
Reis is fluent in seven languages - Cantonese, Mandarin, Shanghainese, English, Portuguese, Japanese, and Italian - and has used several of these languages in her films, such as Shanghainese in &quot;Flowers of Shanghai&quot; (1998) and Japanese in &quot;The City of Lost Souls&quot; (2000)&quot;.&quot; She is Catholic&quot;.&quot;

On 23 November 2008, following a public two-year courtship, Reis married business tycoon Julian Hui, son of real-estate billionaire Hui Sai Fun (1921–2018). Their son Jayden Max Hui was born on 8 February 2011. His initials are derived from the first initials, &quot;J&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, of his parents&#x27; names. 

In 2007, a viral audio of Reis and business tycoon Joseph Lau leaked onto the internet caused controversy, in which Reis and Lau had a heated argument regarding actresses he had signed, including Ada Choi and Catherine Hung. Reis&#x27; use of profanity directed at Lau led netizens to imply the two to be in a relationship and being able to swear profusely behind his wife&#x27;s back during that time, although the quality and time indicated that the audio was recorded in the 1990s. Reis&#x27; famous line &quot;I&#x27;m really gonna congratulate you/I give my congratulations!&quot; () is often used by people nowadays as a sarcastic manner online or in real life.

On 15 January 2022, Reis was rushed to ICU after a near death experience due to breathing complications.

In mainland China in 2010, it was a popular meme for several Chinese white-collar workers to display images of Michelle Reis at the office to subtly ask for a raise in salary because her Chinese name Jiāxīn (嘉欣) is an exact homophone of 加薪 (&quot;pay raise&quot;) in Mandarin Chinese, and is a near-homophone in Cantonese language (ga1yan1/ga1san1).

<text>Gulf Air () is the flag carrier of Bahrain, which was founded in 1950. Headquartered in Muharraq, the airline operates scheduled flights to 61 destinations in 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Europe. The airline&#x27;s main hub is at Bahrain International Airport.

Gulf Air currently serves all its destinations with a mixed fleet consisting of the narrow-body Airbus A320, Airbus A321 and Airbus A320neo family aircraft, as well as the wide-body Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. Gulf Air is the sponsor of the Bahrain Grand Prix and Bahrain International Airshow. Dubai–International is the busiest route served by the airline, with over 95 flights a week back and forth.

==History==
===1949–1973: Gulf Aviation===

In the late 1940s, Freddie Bosworth, a British pilot and entrepreneur, began an air taxi service to Doha and Dhahran from Bahrain, registering the Gulf Aviation Company Limited on 24 March 1950. In October 1951, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) became a major shareholder in Gulf Aviation, holding a 22% stake through the BOAC subsidiary company BOAC Associated Companies.
By the early 70&#x27;s Gulf Aviation&#x27;s fleet included three Fokker F27 and two BAC 1-11 aircraft, serving destinations such as Bahrain, Doha, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Kuwait. Their timetable also included twice-weekly flights to London, although these were operated by BOAC Vickers VC10.

===1974: Gulf Air established===
In 1973 the governments of the Emirate (now Kingdom) of Bahrain, the State of Qatar, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the Sultanate of Oman agreed to purchase the BOAC Associated Companies holding in Gulf Aviation. The Foundation Treaty was signed on 1 January 1974 and gave each government a 25% shareholding in Gulf Aviation, which became a holding company. The operating company was now branded as Gulf Air and became the flag carrier for the four states. Gulf Air inherited a variety of aircraft from Gulf Aviation, repainting them with new titles and colour scheme, and transferring them to the A4O- register. But most significantly they gained five ex-BOAC Vickers VC10s allowing them to commence a full schedule with flights on every day of the week to London, and also regular services new destinations such as Bombay, Karachi, Amman, Cairo, Beirut and Athens.

With Lockheed L-1011 Tristar and Boeing 737 aircraft joining the fleet, by 1976 Gulf Air had expanded its route network to include Amman, Amsterdam, Athens, Baghdad, Bombay, Bangkok, Beirut, Cairo, Colombo, Delhi, Dhaka, Hong Kong, Jeddah, Karachi, Khartoum, Larnaca, Manila, Paris, Ras al-Khaimah and Sana&#x27;a. As more Lockheed L-1011s and Boeing 737-200s arrived, the VC10s and BAC One-Elevens were phased out.

===1980s–1992: expansion===

The 1980s saw an increase in air travel and growth for Gulf Air. In 1981, Gulf Air became an IATA member, and in the following year became the first international airline to land at Riyadh. In 1985, Emirates, the airline of the Emirate of Dubai, began operating. During their first year of operations, Gulf Air profits fell 30%, prompting the airline to drop its privatization plans. In 1986, Gulf Air posted a loss.

In 1988, Boeing 767s joined the fleet, and the airline commenced services to Frankfurt, Istanbul, Damascus, Dar es Salaam, Fujairah and Nairobi, and resumed services to Shiraz and Baghdad.

Whilst the VC10s were painted in the original Gulf Air livery (green/maroon brown/red stripes all along the fuselage and then sweeping up the tail), the arrival of the Lockheed L1011 TriStar in 1976 brought a new &#x27;Golden Falcon&#x27; colour scheme featuring a predominantly white fuselage, with tri-coloured flashes on the nose, and a large golden falcon on the tail fin. This livery was used on the following types: Lockheed L1011-200 TriStar (1976), Boeing 737-200 (1977), Boeing 767-300ER (1988), Airbus A320-200 (1992), Airbus A340-300 (1994) and Airbus A330-200 (1999), but was also applied to at least some of the VC10s in their last few months of service.

Gulf Air celebrated its 40th anniversary in 1990. The light-blue and peach Balenciaga-designed uniform was introduced. Services to Singapore, Sydney and Thiruvananthapuram were launched, making Gulf Air the first Arab airline to fly to Australia. Gulf Air added services to Johannesburg and Melbourne in 1992, becoming the first Arab airline to fly directly to these cities. In 1993, it opened a flight-simulator centre in Qatar and introduced service to Casablanca, Entebbe, Jakarta, Kilimanjaro, Madras, Rome, San&#x27;a&#x27;, Zanzibar and Zürich.

===1993–2005: new livery and destinations===
In May 1994, Gulf Air received its first Airbus A340-300. Two months later, the carrier began flights to New York City using an A340. The Gulf Air website was opened in January 1997, and New York services were discontinued the following month. A no-smoking policy was established in 1998 on flights to Singapore and Australia, which was later introduced on all flights. In 1999, Gulf Air launched three new routes in northern Pakistan: Islamabad, Lahore and Peshawar. It also took delivery of two Airbus A330-200 aircraft, and introduced a new uniform designed by Balmain.

In 2000, the airline celebrated its 50th anniversary. It took delivery of the remaining Airbus A330-200 aircraft in June, and launched services to Milan. Later in August 2000, Gulf Air Flight 072, operating on a flight from Cairo to Bahrain was involved in a fatal crash which resulted in 143 deaths.

In May 2002, James Hogan became president and CEO of Gulf Air and instigated a restructuring and turnaround programme in response to a drastic fall in profits and increasing debt. By 1 August 2002, Qatar announced its intentions to withdraw from Gulf Air to focus on its own national airline, Qatar Airways. The state remained a member state for a six-month period after announcing the intention to withdraw.

In 2003, Gulf Air introduced a new Landor Associates-designed gold and blue livery and, in June, established Gulf Traveller, a subsidiary, all-economy, full-service airline. It also announced a sponsorship deal for the Bahrain Grand Prix through 2010, creating the Gulfair Bahrain Grand Prix, of which the first was staged in 2004. The airline also introduced daily flights to Athens and Sydney via Singapore on 23 November 2003.

In 2004, Gulf Air introduced direct flights between Dubai and London, Muscat and London, and a daily service between Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaimah. The airline carried a record 7.5 million passengers during that year. Gulf Air&#x27;s sponsorship of the Bahrain Formula 1 Grand Prix continued, with a record race crowd and a global TV audience. The airline announced a return to profit, with the best financial performance since 1997. Despite a BD30 million (US$80 million) cost to the business through fuel price rises during the year, Gulf Air recorded a profit of BD1.5 million (US$4.0 million) in the calendar year to December 2004, on revenues up 23.8% to BD476.3 million (US$1.26 billion) (2003: BD 384.6 million / USD1,020.2 million). The results meant the airline out-performed the targets set under Project Falcon, the three-year restructuring plan approved by the Board in December 2002.

The owner states of Gulf Air at that time—the Kingdom of Bahrain, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and the Sultanate of Oman—confirmed their support for further expansion of the airline through a new three-year strategic plan which would include re-equipment of the aircraft fleet and recapitalization of the business through private-sector financing. Gulf Air was also placed on the IOSA registry following its successful completion of the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA).

===2006–2009: full ownership by Bahrain===

The new summer schedule commencing 28 April 2006 saw the complete withdrawal from Abu Dhabi as a hub, following the decision on 13 September 2005 by the Emirate of Abu Dhabi to withdraw from Gulf Air and establish UAE flag carrier Etihad Airways. Gulf Air changed its operations to a dual-hub basis between Bahrain and Muscat airports. The airline ran a series of advertisements in local newspapers, thanking Abu Dhabi for its contribution to Gulf Air. As the national carrier for the United Arab Emirates for over 35 years, it has a large customer base located in Abu Dhabi. Gulf Air endeavoured to show continuing support for flights to Abu Dhabi from Bahrain and Muscat, connecting to the rest of the Gulf Air network, via advertisements placed in local newspapers.

James Hogan resigned as president and chief executive officer as of 1 October 2006 (subsequently becoming CEO at rival airline Etihad). Ahmed Al Hammadi was named acting chief executive officer, until Swiss national André Dosé, the former chief executive officer of Crossair and Swiss International Air Lines, became CEO on 1 April 2007. A few days later, Dosé announced a BD310 million (US$825 million) restructuring plan. This included originating or terminating all flights in Bahrain; ceasing routes to Johannesburg, Dublin, Jakarta, Singapore, Hong Kong and Sydney; eliminating all Boeing 767s and Airbus A340-300s from the fleet; introducing the Airbus A321 in July 2007 and the Airbus A330-300 in 2009; and potentially terminating employment based on performance, and without regard for nationality. This led to some employees applying for jobs in other airlines and, in less than a month, Gulf Air lost 500 persons from its workforce, prompting the airline to rule out mass layoffs as part of its recovery plan, except for performance reasons.

On 5 May 2007, the government of Bahrain has taken full ownership of the airline following an extraordinary general meeting, as its joint-owner Oman withdrew from the airline to focus on Oman Air. Gulf Air had also announced cutbacks to 25% of its workforce or roughly 1,500 jobs as part of a 2-year restructuring program to stop losses of $1 million a day. André Dosé resigned on 23 July 2007 and was replaced by Bjorn Naf, prompting the Bahraini government to call for further transparency in the airline&#x27;s running, and delegating parliament&#x27;s financial and economic affairs committee to investigate Gulf Air&#x27;s situation. On 6 November 2007, Gulf Air started its third daily non-stop flight to London Heathrow Airport from Bahrain.

The airline inaugurated services to Shanghai Pudong International Airport on 16 June 2008 (the route was terminated on 25 December 2009). It also placed orders with Boeing (for 16 787s) and Airbus (for 15 A320s and 20 A330s) to upgrade its fleet. The airline&#x27;s last commercial Boeing 767 flight was on 29 May 2008. On 3 July 2008, Gulf Air was announced as the official sponsor of London association football club, Queens Park Rangers. The same year, Gulf Air signed a lease agreement for five aircraft with International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) as part of its growth and expansion strategy. The lease was for six years for two Airbus A319s and three Airbus A330-200s, due for delivery in March, April and May 2009.
In March 2009, Gulf Air signed a 42-month lease agreement with Jet Airways for four Boeing 777-300ERs, but the aircraft were returned to Jet Airways starting in September 2009. In May, Gulf Air inaugurated summer seasonal flights to Alexandria, Aleppo and Salalah. On 1 September 2009, Gulf Air resumed flights to Baghdad. Services to Najaf and Erbil began shortly afterward.

Starting June 2009, Gulf Air&#x27;s Golden Falcon logo was seen on the streets of London, emblazoned on the side of the city&#x27;s taxi cabs, as part a two-year marketing deal. Fifty Hackney Carriages were to be rolled out in full Gulf Air livery to promote the airline&#x27;s flights from London Heathrow to Bahrain and beyond. Later in June, the carrier announced the departure of CEO Bjorn Naf and the appointment of Samer Majali (who worked previously for Royal Jordanian) as CEO effective 1 August 2009.

===2010s: restructuring===
On 1 March 2010, Gulf Air launched its new &quot;Falcon Gold&quot; cabin, a single premium cabin merging business and first class together, aimed at offering higher standards of comfort for the standard premium price. As of August 2011, the new Flat Beds were installed on all aircraft except short-haul aircraft.
In 2011, Gulf Air temporarily suspended flights to Iran, Iraq and Lebanon during the height of the Bahraini uprising. The airline originally was to resume service to Iran from November 2012, but cancelled the plan as it was unable to receive approval from the Iranian authorities. Flights to Iran resumed in March 2014.

In November 2012, Gulf Air phased out its last Airbus A340-300. At the end of November 2012, it was announced that Gulf Air CEO Samer Majali&#x27;s resignation had been accepted by the board of directors. Majali left by the end of 2012, after serving the company for three years. In March 2013, the airline announced that it cut 15% of its total staff alongside four unprofitable routes as part of its restructuring program. Maher Salman Al Musallam was the acting CEO of Gulf Air until May 2016, when he was officially appointed to the role. Musallam later resigned in June 2017 with his tenure being praised with reducing the airline&#x27;s debts by 88%. On 12 November 2017, Gulf Air appointed former Croatia Airlines CEO Krešimir Kučko as the airline&#x27;s new CEO.

At the Bahrain International Airshow in January 2016, Gulf Air ordered 17 A321neo and 12 A320neo aircraft for delivery from June 2018, and cancelled a commitment to acquire six A330-300 aircraft. In addition, the airline also announced a restructured order for 16 Boeing 787-9 aircraft. The new order of 16 Boeing 787-9 aircraft replaced an existing order for 16 of the smaller Boeing 787-8 aircraft. In June 2017, Gulf Air suspended its flights to Qatar during the Qatar diplomatic crisis. In February 2018, Gulf Air revealed its new livery. It consisted of an all-white fuselage with a smaller golden falcon on the tail and with dark blue &#x27;Gulf Air&#x27; titles. In February 2019, the airline briefly suspended flights to Pakistan after the country temporarily closed its airspace due to increased tensions with India. In January 2020, Gulf Air retired its last Airbus A330-200 in favor of the newer Boeing 787-9.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership and structure===
Gulf Air is state-owned. The airline&#x27;s sole shareholder is the Gulf Air Group Holding Company, which holds the aviation assets of Bahrain Mumtalakat, the sovereign wealth fund of the government of the Kingdom of Bahrain.

The Gulf Air Group Holding board on 5 December 2022, announced the appointment of Jeffrey Goh as its group chief executive officer. Goh, who was previously CEO at Star Alliance, was due to take up his new role on 1 January 2023. The Gulf Air Group Holding comprises national carrier Gulf Air, Bahrain Airport Company, BAC Jet Fuel Company, and Gulf Aviation Academy. The group is also a substantial shareholder in Bahrain Airport Services Company and Bahrain Duty Free Company.

=== Business trends ===
Gulf Air continues to be loss-making. In 2011, due largely to political unrest in the state of Bahrain, Gulf Air lost BHD95 million, and the loss grew to BHD196 million in 2012. A decision was taken in 2013 to implement a turnaround plan that involved reducing the airline&#x27;s fleet, number of staff and number of destinations, and the losses reduced - and in 2015, the loss reported was BHD24.1 million, an 88% reduction from 2012. Efforts to become profitable have continued; in January 2019, the carrier announced a &quot;boutique business model&quot; as part of its business plans for 2019, as it aims to turn around its fortunes.

Few business figures are released on a regular basis, but those available are shown below (as at year ending 31 December):

===Sponsorship===
Gulf Air sponsors events, of which the most prestigious is the Bahrain Grand Prix. This is usually the first, second, third, or fourth race of the Formula One season, and is held in March or April. Gulf Air was also the first ever shirt sponsor of Chelsea F.C. in 1983 and 1984. More recently, it was shirt sponsor of Queens Park Rangers F.C. from 2008 to 2011. It also sponsors the Bahrain International Airshow.

===Historical fleet===
Over the years, Gulf Air has operated the following aircraft types:
==Accidents and incidents==
* On 22 November 1976, a Gulf Air Short SC.7 Skyvan cargo plane travelling from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi-Al Bateen Airport experienced an engine failure. The crew abandoned the aircraft off Das Island. The two occupants were rescued while the airplane sank. 
* On 23 September 1983: Gulf Air Flight 771 was a flight from Karachi, Pakistan to Qatar via Abu Dhabi. While the Boeing 737-200 was on approach to Abu Dhabi International Airport, a bomb exploded in the baggage compartment. The aircraft crashed in the desert near Mina Jebel Ali between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the UAE. All seven crew members and 105 passengers died. Most of the fatalities were Pakistani nationals, many returning to jobs in the Gulf after spending the Eid ul-Adha holiday with their families in Pakistan. The bomb was apparently planted by the Abu Nidal Organization, to pressure the Gulf States to pay protection money to Abu Nidal so as to avoid attacks on their soil.
* On 10 March 1997, a Gulf Air A320 (A4O-EM) aborted takeoff at Abu Dhabi International Airport and overran the runway, causing the nosegear to collapse. Everyone on board survived.
*On 23 August 2000: Gulf Air Flight 072 crashed into the waters of the Persian Gulf on approach to Bahrain International Airport from Cairo. The Airbus A320, with 143 passengers and crew on board, approached the landing at higher speeds than normal, and carried out an unusual low altitude orbit in an attempt to correct the approach. The orbit was unsuccessful and a go-around was attempted. While carrying out a turning climb the aircraft entered a descent at 15 degrees nose down. The aircrew did not respond to repeated GPWS warnings and approximately one minute after starting the go-around the aircraft disappeared from radar screens. All 143 passengers and crew, including 36 children, were killed in the accident. The accident investigation concluded that the primary cause of the crash was pilot error (including spatial disorientation), with a secondary factor being systemic organizational and oversight issues. Flight 072 was the highest death toll of any accident involving an Airbus A320 at that time. It was subsequently surpassed by TAM Airlines Flight 3054, which crashed on 17 July 2007 with 199 fatalities.
* On 29 August 2011, Gulf Air Flight 270, using an Airbus A320-214, from Bahrain to Cochin carrying 143 people, skidded off the runway on landing due to pilot error of loss of situational awareness during reduced visibility conditions. The weather was poor with heavy rain and strong winds. The aircraft was badly damaged with nose gear collapsed and seven passengers were injured. Some people were reported to have jumped from an emergency exit when the evacuation slide failed to deploy.

<text>Julia Maesa (7 May before 160 AD – AD) was a member of the Severan dynasty of the Roman Empire who was the grandmother of emperors Elagabalus and Severus Alexander, elder sister of empress Julia Domna, and mother of Julia Soaemias and Julia Mamaea. She wielded influence during the reigns of her grandsons as Augusta of the Empire from 218 to her death, especially on their elevation to emperors.

Born in Emesa, Syria (modern day Homs), to an Arab family of priests of the deity Elagabalus, Maesa and her sister Domna were the daughters of Julius Bassianus. Through her sister&#x27;s marriage, Maesa became sister-in-law to Septimius Severus and aunt of Caracalla and Geta, who all became emperors. She married fellow Syrian Julius Avitus, who was of consular rank. They had two daughters, Soaemias and Mamaea, who became mothers of Elagabalus and Severus Alexander, respectively.

As one of the Severan dynasty&#x27;s prominent women, Maesa sought to return to power after her sister&#x27;s suicide. She was closely involved in raising her grandson Elagabalus, and after his murder, another grandson, Severus Alexander, as emperors, which resulted in the restoration of the Severan dynasty to the Roman throne after the assassination of Caracalla and the usurpation of the throne by Macrinus. Sometime after Alexander&#x27;s accession, she died in Rome. She was later deified in Syria along with her sister.

== Early life and marriage ==

Julia Maesa was born on 7 May before 160 AD, the elder daughter of the priest Julius Bassianus in Emesa, Syria, modern day Homs, as part of the Emesan dynasty. She had a younger sister, Julia Domna, who would later become Roman empress after her marriage to Septimius Severus, who was, by the time of their marriage, a senator.

As Maesa was an Arab, her cognomen, Maesa, is the feminine agent noun of the Arabic verb &quot;masa&quot; (), which signifies walking with a swinging gait. This would be an appropriate female name, as the verb from which it was derived was used by Arab poets to describe the figures of the women they wrote about. Although no written account describing her appearance survives, her sharp and formidable features, which contradict the soft and sensitive ones of her sister, are well displayed on the coins minted during the reign of her grandchildren.

Maesa later married a fellow Syrian, Julius Avitus, a consul who also served as provincial governor in the empire. They had two daughters; her eldest daughter, Julia Soaemias, was born around 180 AD or some time before, and was followed by another daughter, Julia Mamaea, not long after.

== Life in Rome ==

After her sister&#x27;s arrival in Rome and the beginning of her tenure as empress consort, Maesa, accompanied by her family, travelled to Rome where they took up residence in the imperial court, although her husband, Julius Avitus, who held several important posts, did not stay in Rome for long and had to make many journeys across the empire; she did not accompany him on the journeys.

During their time in Rome, Maesa and her family amassed great wealth and fortune, and rose to high positions in the Roman government and court of Septimius Severus and later, his son and successor, Caracalla. Her two daughters attained prominent positions in the court while their Syrian husbands held important posts as provincial governors and consuls, with Maesa&#x27;s husband, along with that of her daughter rising from the Equestrian rank to reach Senatorial rank.

=== Return to Emesa ===
In 217 AD, after the murder of emperor Caracalla and the usurpation of the throne by Macrinus, Maesa&#x27;s sister Domna, now suffering from breast cancer and bereft of the power and influence she had held during the reigns of her husband and her son, having lost both of her children, chose to commit suicide by starvation.

Maesa and her family, who had resided in Rome for the last two decades, were spared and ordered by Macrinus to leave Rome and return to their home town of Emesa in Syria, likely because Macrinus wanted to avoid any action that would seem disloyal to Caracalla&#x27;s memory and thus avoid any reprisals from the Roman army. Macrinus left Maesa&#x27;s great wealth, amassed over a period of over twenty years, intact. Maesa arrived in Emesa some time between spring 217 and spring 218.

== Restoration of the Severan dynasty ==

Macrinus was in a difficult position after Caracalla&#x27;s assassination and was struggling to gain legitimacy and maintain loyalty to his rule. This situation encouraged Maesa to act against Macrinus. Being located in Emesa, she was close to a military base where many soldiers still held the Severans in high esteem and were loyal to the dynasty. The soldiers were also discontented with Macrinus&#x27; peace with the Parthians, making Emesa an excellent location to launch a coup to restore her family to power.

Her first step was to choose a male candidate from within the family to replace the usurper, Macrinus. Maesa&#x27;s husband died in Cyprus shortly before 217, as had her eldest daughter&#x27;s husband. Julia Soaemias had a 14-year-old son, Varius Avitus Bassianus, who was the hereditary priest of the Emesan sun god Elagabalus. But Maesa had a different future in mind for him. He had begun attracting the soldiers of the Legio III Gallica stationed near Emesa, who would visit the city&#x27;s temple occasionally to view what they considered to be the extravagant yet amusing religious rituals of Bassianus.

Maesa proceeded with her plot of trying to challenge the legitimacy of emperor Macrinus, and she did so by claiming that Bassianus, who greatly resembled Caracalla, was indeed the former emperor&#x27;s bastard son and that Caracalla had slept with both her daughters. The claim that Bassianus was the love child of Caracalla and Soaemias, despite almost certainly being untrue, was not so easily refuted, as aside from the young boy&#x27;s resemblance to the emperor, Soaemias had been living in the Roman court at the time of Caracalla&#x27;s reign. Maesa did not seem to mind that this claim would be sacrificing the honour and reputation of her daughters.

Julia Maesa began offering to distribute her great wealth and fortune to the Roman soldiers based in Emesa in exchange for their support. This news spread throughout the army camps. Maesa, her daughter and Bassianus were taken into the army camp at night where the 14-year-old boy was immediately acknowledged and hailed as emperor by the soldiers and clad in imperial purple.

Historian Cassius Dio narrates a slightly different version of events. He mentions a certain Gannys, who is not mentioned as partaking in the plot in any other source, as the main instigator of the revolt. Allegedly a &#x27;youth who has not yet reached manhood&#x27;, Dio claims he was raised by Maesa and was Soaemias&#x27; lover and the protector of her son. On a certain night, Bassianus was dressed in clothes worn by Caracalla as a child. Without the knowledge of either Soaemias or Maesa, Gannys then took him to the army camp and claimed he was the murdered emperor&#x27;s son.

It is unlikely that Maesa and Soaemias, with much to gain from Bassianus becoming emperor, would have been completely unaware of the actions of Gannys. On the other hand, it is also unlikely that Maesa alone orchestrated the young boy&#x27;s ascension. In her plan she probably had the support of many important figures from the city of Emesa and even some figures in Rome&#x27;s ruling elite.

=== Reaction of Macrinus ===

With the support of an entire legion, other legionaries, prompted by discontent over pay, deserted Macrinus and joined Elagabalus&#x27; ranks as well. In response to the growing threat, Macrinus sent out a cavalry force under the command of Ulpius Julianus to try to regain control of the rebel soldiers. Rather than capturing the rebel forces, the cavalry instead killed Ulpius and defected to Elagabalus.

Following these events, Macrinus travelled to Apamea to ensure the loyalty of Legio II &quot;Parthica&quot; before setting off to march against Emesa. According to Dio, Macrinus appointed his son Diadumenian to the position of Imperator, and promised the soldiers 20,000 sesterces each, with 4,000 of these to be paid on the spot. Dio further says that Macrinus hosted a dinner for the residents of Apamea in honour of Diadumenian. At the dinner, Macrinus was supposedly presented with the head of Ulpius Julianus who had been killed by his soldiers. In response, Macrinus left Apamea and headed south.

Macrinus and Elagabalus&#x27; troops met somewhere near the border of Syria Coele and Syria Phoenice. Despite Macrinus&#x27; efforts to quell the rebellion at this engagement, his whole legion defected to Elagabalus forcing Macrinus to retire to Antioch. Elagabus took to the offensive and marched on Antioch.

==== Battle of Antioch ====
Elagabalus&#x27; armies, commanded by the inexperienced but determined Gannys, engaged Macrinus&#x27; Praetorian Guard in a pitched battle. Gannys commanded at least two full legions and held numerical superiority over the fewer levies that Macrinus had been able to raise. Macrinus had ordered the Praetorian Guard to set aside their scaled armour breastplates and grooved shields in favour of lighter oval shields prior to the battle. This made them lighter and more manoeuvrable and negated any advantage light Parthian lancers had. The Praetorian Guards broke through the lines of Gannys&#x27; force, which turned to flee. During the retreat, however, Julia Maesa and Soaemias, in a surprising act of heroism joined the fray, leaping from their chariots to rally the retreating forces, while Gannys charged on horseback headlong into the enemy. These actions effectively ended the retreat with the troops resuming the assault with renewed morale, thus turning the tide of battle. Fearing defeat, Macrinus fled back to the city of Antioch. He attempted to escape north but was captured and executed in Cappadocia, while his son Diadumenian was captured in Zeugma and executed as well.

Elagabalus entered Antioch as effectively Rome&#x27;s new emperor. He stopped the soldiers from sacking the city and sent a message to the senate who were forced to accept the young boy as their new emperor. Upon ascension as emperor he took the name &quot;Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus&quot;.

== Reign of Elagabalus ==
Although now declared emperor, Elagabalus&#x27; claim was not uncontested, as several others laid claim to the Roman throne. These included Verus, the commander of Legio III Gallica, who ironically was the first to proclaim Elagabalus as emperor, and Gellius Maximus, the commander of Legio IV Scythica. These rebellions were quashed and their instigators executed.

Elagabalus spent the winter of 218–219 in Nicomedia before he set off for Rome. Maesa allegedly urged him to enter the capital draped in Roman clothes, but instead, he had a painting of him made as a priest making offerings to the Emesene deity El-Gabal. The painting was hung right above the statue of Victoria in the senate, putting senators in the awkward position of having to make offerings to the Syrian deity whenever they wanted to make offerings to Victoria.

Both Maesa and her daughter Soaemias are featured heavily in all literary accounts of his reign, and are credited with having a significant influence over the young emperor. Julia Maesa was honoured with the titles of &#x27;Augusta, mater castrorum et senatus&#x27; (Augusta, mother of the camp and the senate) and &#x27;avia Augusti&#x27; (grandmother of the emperor). She and her daughter Soaemias received senatorial titles and later appeared in the Senate beside Elagabalus during his adoption of Severus Alexander, an honour previous imperial women had not received.

Soon, the young emperor lost his popularity with the praetorian guards, who did not approve of his behaviour and his unusual religious rituals. Considering how their support was crucial for his rule to survive, this was an extremely dangerous development. Julia Maesa decided to take measures to prevent things from getting too out of hand. When she opposed his move to raise his lover Hierocles to &quot;caesar&quot;, he threatened her life. However, she convinced her grandson to adopt his cousin, her grandson Alexander, and declare him &quot;caesar&quot;, with the argument that it would leave more time for Elagabalus to devote himself to religious matters. The adoption of the 12 years old Alexander provided a strategic shift for the supporters of Elagabalus, as some of the supporters felt it was no longer wise to tie their fate with that of the priest-emperor and now saw an alternative in his adopted son.

Rivalry was soon increasing between the two boys and Elagabalus regretted adopting his more popular cousin. The soldiers began to look favourably upon Elagabalus&#x27; cousin, and the allies and supporters of the dynasty as well as the imperial family itself became divided, with Elagabalus and Soaemias on one side, and Mamaea, Maesa and Alexander on the other.

By the beginning of 222, Alexander and Elagabalus had become so estranged from each other that they no longer appeared together in public. An assassination attempt against Alexander by Elagabalus enraged the praetorian guards who demanded an assurance of Alexander&#x27;s safety from Elagabalus and the dismissal of certain officials. Elagabalus broke his promise to do so, prompting the praetorian guard to slay Elagabalus and his mother, cutting their heads off and throwing aside their bodies. Alexander was now proclaimed emperor.

A traditionally held belief is that while Elagabalus was mainly involved in religious matters, Julia Maesa and her daughter were the ones effectively running the state. This claim has been treated with caution by contemporary historians such as Barabara Levick, as in ancient Rome, politics and religion were intertwined and the rule of Elagabalus and the supremacy of his particular deity broke this relationship. In any case it is certain that Maesa had influence over the young boy, but Elagabalus&#x27; disagreements and dismissal of Maesa&#x27;s advice, who was an advocate of Roman traditionalism, can be seen as the primary cause of his downfall.

Julia Maesa may have been involved in the assassination of her daughter and grandson by conspiring with the praetorian guards, or at least she tolerated it. However, it may have helped her to retain her family&#x27;s grip on power and preserve the empire&#x27;s stability.

== Reign of Severus Alexander ==
Alexander ascended the throne at the age of around 14, and he was kept in check by his mother and grandmother who were determined to erase the negative impression left by Elagabalus&#x27; rule. Alexander was given the name Marcus Aurelius Severus Alexander to emphasize his relationship to Septimius Severus, the founder of the dynasty. 

Julia Mamaea and Julia Maesa also helped guide the smooth running of the empire in Alexander&#x27;s minority. The inscriptions carrying the emperor&#x27;s name referred to him as &quot;Juliae Mamaeae Aug(ustae) filio Juliae Maesae Aug(ustae) nepote&quot; (the son of Julia Mamaea and grandson of Julia Maesa), showing their status. The changes introduced by Maesa and her daughter included selecting a council of sixteen chosen for their moderation and experience to control the affairs of the administration and provide advice to the young emperor, restoring an aristocratic and non-tyrannical form of government. Under the new regime, new measures reversing Elagabalus&#x27; policies were introduced. The eastern religious practices introduced by the former emperor were eradicated in Rome and his religious edicts were reversed, the sacred stone of El-Gabal was returned to Emesa and the vast temple which had been dedicated to him by Elagabalus was re-dedicated to Jupiter.

== Death ==
Maesa likely died between November 224 and 227. Her death deprived her daughter, Julia Mamaea, not only of a mother but also of a political mentor and colleague, and Julia Mamaea was now alone in her family in guiding her son&#x27;s rule.

=== Deification ===
Like her sister Julia Domna, Julia Maesa was deified. In the &quot;Feriale Duranum&quot;, the list of religious observances of the &quot;Cohors XX Palmyrenorum&quot;, dating to AD, Maesa is subject to a supplication on her birthday (7 May). Coins commemorating her deification show her borne aloft on the back of a peacock. The coins are undated, but she also appears deified on the &quot;Acta Fratrum Arvalium&quot; of 7 November 224, which lists the number of gods and goddesses the &quot;Arval Brethren&quot; made sacrifices to on that certain date.

<text>A bill is a proposal for a new law, or a proposal to substantially alter an existing law. 

A bill does not become law until it has been passed by the legislature and, in most cases, approved by the executive. 

Bills are introduced in the legislature and are there discussed, debated on, and voted upon. Once a bill has been enacted into law by the legislature, it is called an &quot;act of the legislature&quot;, or a &quot;statute&quot;. 
==Usage==
The word &quot;bill&quot; is mainly used in English-speaking nations formerly part of the British Empire whose legal systems originated in the common law of the United Kingdom, including the United States. The parts of a bill are known as &quot;clauses&quot;, until it has become an act of parliament, from which time the parts of the law are known as &quot;sections&quot;.

In nations that have civil law systems (including France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal), a proposed law is known as a &quot;law project&quot; (Fr. &quot;projet de loi&quot;) if introduced by the government, or a &quot;law proposition&quot; (Fr. &quot;proposition de loi&quot;) if a private member&#x27;s bill. Some legislatures do not make this terminological distinction (for example the Dutch parliament uses &quot;wetsontwerp&quot; and &quot;wetsvoorstel&quot; interchangeably).

==Preparation==

Bills generally include titles, enacting provisions, statements of intent, definitions, substantive provisions, transitional clauses, and dates which the bill will be put into effect. The preparation of a bill may involve the production of a draft bill prior to the introduction of the bill into the legislature. In the United Kingdom, draft bills are frequently considered to be confidential. Pre-legislative scrutiny is a formal process carried out by a parliamentary committee on a draft bill.

In the Parliament of India, the draft bill is sent to the individual ministry relating to the matter. From there the bill goes to the Ministry of Law and Justice and is then passed on to the Cabinet committee, which the prime minister heads.

Pre-legislative scrutiny is required in much of Scandinavia, occurs in Ireland at the discretion of the Oireachtas (parliament) and occurs in the UK at the government&#x27;s discretion.

In the Parliament of Ireland under Poynings&#x27; Law (1494–1782) legislation had to be pre-approved by the Privy Council of Ireland and Privy Council of England, so in practice each bill was substantively debated as &quot;heads of a bill&quot;, then submitted to the privy councils for approval, and finally formally introduced as a bill and rejected or passed unamended.

==Introduction==
In the Westminster system, where the executive is drawn from the legislature and usually holds a majority in the lower house, most bills are introduced by the executive (government bill). In principle, the legislature meets to consider the demands of the executive, as set out in the King&#x27;s Speech or &quot;speech from the throne&quot;.

Mechanisms exist to allow other members of the legislature to introduce bills, but they are subject to strict timetables and usually fail unless a consensus is reached. In the US system, where the executive is formally separated from the legislature, all bills must originate from the legislature. Bills can be introduced using the following procedures:

*Leave: A motion is brought before the chamber asking that leave be given to bring in a bill. This is used in the British system in the form of the &quot;Ten Minute Rule&quot; motion. The legislator has 10 minutes to propose a bill, which can then be considered by the House on a day appointed for the purpose. While this rule remains in place in the rules of procedure of the US Congress, it is seldom used.
*Government motion: In jurisdictions where the executive can control legislative business a bill may be brought in by executive fiat.

==Legislative stages==

Bills are generally considered through a number of readings. This refers to the historic practice of the clerical officers of the legislature reading the contents of a bill to the legislature. While the bill is no longer read, the motions on the bill still refer to this practice.

=== India ===
In India, for a law to be made it starts off as a bill and has to go through various stages:

# There will be &quot;first reading&quot; of the bill where minister takes leave from the house and introduces title and objectives of the bill. Here, no discussion or voting takes place. And then the bill is published in &quot;Gazette of India&quot;.
# After this there is a &quot;second reading&quot; of the bill, where the bill receives its final shape.
# The bills first go through the &#x27;stage of general discussion&#x27; where the bill is referred to select committee/joint committee for detailed scrutiny through a motion.
# Under &#x27;committee stage&#x27; the bill is scrutinized in detail in the committee and a report is submitted in the respective house.
# Under &#x27;consideration stage&#x27; the bill is discussed in detail in the house and is voted upon.
# Then under &quot;third reading&quot; the bill is voted upon as a whole and if majority of the house present and voting favours the bill, then the bill is considered passed and is authenticated by presiding officer.
# The bill is then passed to the other house for its consideration.
# And if both houses agree, the bill reaches the president where he can assent, withhold assent, return for consideration and can also sit on the bill.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, a proposed new law starts off as a bill that goes through seven stages of the legislative process: first reading, second reading, committee stage, report stage, third reading, opposite house, and royal assent. A bill is introduced by a member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons or by a member of the House of Lords.

There will be a first reading of the bill, in which the proposition in the bill is read out, but there is minimal discussion and no voting.

A second reading of the bill follows, in which the bill is presented in more detail and it is discussed between the MPs or Lords.

The third stage is the committee stage, in which a committee is gathered. This may include MPs, Lords, professionals and experts in the field, and other people who the bill may affect. The purpose of this stage is to go into more detail on the bill and gather expert opinions on it (e.g. teachers may be present in a committee about a bill that would affect the education system) and amendments may be brought.

After this is the report stage, in which the entire house reviews any and all changes made to the bill since its conception and may bring further amendments.

The fifth stage is the third reading of the bill, in which the full bill is read out in the house along with all amendments and is given final approval by the House.

The next stage is where the bill is handed over to the opposite house for approval. (If it started in the House of Commons it will be handed to the House of Lords and vice versa.) Here the bill will go through the same process as before, with amendments able to be brought. If amendments are brought, the bill will again be handed to the opposite house, going through the same process, which repeats until both houses arrive at an agreement on the bill. (In the rare circumstance that the two houses cannot agree, the House of Commons has the final say since it is an elected body, whereas the House of Lords is not).

Once the bill is finalised, it will move to the final stage, royal assent, when the monarch signs or otherwise signifies approval for the bill to become law. Theoretically, the monarch could refuse assent to a bill, but no monarch has done so since Queen Anne in 1708, and the royal veto has fallen into disuse. Once the assent is granted, the law comes into effect at the date and time specified within the act; if this is not specified within the act, it comes into effect at midnight on the same day it is granted royal assent.

==Enactment and after==
Where a piece of primary legislation is termed an act, the process of a bill becoming law may be termed enactment. Once a bill is passed by the legislature, it may automatically become law, or it may need further approval, in which case enactment may be effected by the approver&#x27;s signature or proclamation.

===Approval===

Bills passed by the legislature usually require the approval of the head of state such as the monarch, president, or governor to become law. The refusal of such an approval is typically known as a &quot;veto&quot;.

Exceptions are the Irish Free State from the abolition of the governor-general in December 1936 to the creation of the office of president in December 1937, and Israel from its formation until today, during which period bills approved by the Oireachtas and Knesset respectively became/become law immediately (though, in Israel&#x27;s case, the laws are ceremonially signed after their passage by the president).

In parliamentary systems, approval of the head of state is normally a formality since the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead. The exercise of the veto is considered a reserve power and is typically only used in rare circumstances, and the legislature can usually override the veto by a simple majority vote. However, in most cases, the executive – a cabinet of ministers responsible to parliament – takes a veto by the head of state into account.

In presidential systems, the head of state is also the chief executive, and the need to receive approval can be used as a political tool by them. The legislature is only able to override the veto by means of a supermajority vote.

In some jurisdictions, a bill passed by the legislature may also require approval by a constitutional court. If the court finds the bill would violate the constitution it may annul it or send it back to the legislature for correction. In Ireland, the president has discretion under Article 26 of the Constitution to refer bills to the Supreme Court. In Germany, the Federal Constitutional Court has discretion to rule on bills.

Some bills may require approval by referendum. In Ireland this is obligatory for bills to amend the constitution; it is possible for other bills via a process that has never been used.

===Afterwards===
A bill may come into force as soon as it becomes law, or it may specify a later date to come into force, or it may specify by whom and how it may be brought into force; for example, by ministerial order. Different parts of an act may come into force at different times.

An act is typically promulgated by being published in an official gazette. This may be required on enactment, coming into force, or both.

==Numbering of bills==
Legislatures may give bills numbers as they progress.

===Australia===
Bills are not given numbers in Australia and are typically cited by their short titles. They are only given an act number upon royal assent.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, bills originating in both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are numbered sequentially, prefixed with &quot;PL&quot; () and optionally suffixed with the year they were proposed, separated by a slash, as in PL 1234/1988. Until 2019, each house used a different numbering and naming system, but the system was unified by a 2018 joint act by the secretaries of both houses.

Before the 2019 unification, the Senate numbered bills starting at the beginning of each year, while the lower house numbered bills starting at the beginning of each legislature. This meant that bills sent from one house to another could adopt two or more different names.

===Canada===
In the House of Commons of Canada, the pro forma bill is numbered C-1, Government Bills are numbered C-2 to C-200, numbered sequentially from the start of each parliamentary session, and Private member&#x27;s bills are numbered C-201 to C-1000, numbered sequentially from the start of each Parliament. 

The numbering system is identical in the Senate of Canada, except that bills first introduced in the Senate of Canada begin with &quot;S&quot; instead of &quot;C&quot;.

=== Ireland ===
In the Irish Oireachtas, bills are numbered sequentially from the start of each calendar year. Bills originating in the Dáil and Seanad share a common sequence. There are separate sequences for public and private bills, the latter prefixed with &quot;P&quot;. Although acts to amend the constitution are outside the annual sequence used for other public acts, bills to amend the constitution are within the annual sequence of public bills.

=== Philippines ===

In the Philippines, all bills passed into law, regardless of whether they were introduced in the House of Representatives or the Senate, are numbered sequentially beginning with the first Republic Act that became law on July 15, 1946. There have been 11,646 Republic Acts as of January 21, 2022. All laws passed by Congress, once given presidential assent, become law and are given a sequential number and are prefixed with &quot;Republic Act&quot; or &quot;R.A.&quot; for short. They are also given a secondary sequential number by the chamber they are introduced in. Aforementioned numberings restart every three years after the formation of a new Congress.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, for example, the Coroners and Justice Act in 2009 started as Bill 9 in the House of Commons. Then it became Bill 72 on consideration by a public bill committee; after that it became House of Lords Bill 33. Then it became House of Lords Bill 77, returned to the House of Commons as Bill 160, before finally being passed as Act 29. Parliament recommences numbering from one at the beginning of each session. This means that two different bills may have the same number. Sessions of parliament usually last a year. They begin with the State Opening of Parliament, and end with prorogation.

=== United States ===
In the United States, all bills originating in the House of Representatives are numbered sequentially and prefixed with &quot;H.R.&quot; and all bills originating from the Senate begin with an &quot;S.&quot;. Every two years, at the start of odd-numbered years, the Congress recommences numbering from 1, though for bills the House has an order reserving the first 20 bill numbers and the Senate has similar measures for the first 10 bills. Joint resolutions also have the same effect as bills, and are titled as &quot;H. J. Res.&quot; or &quot;S. J. Res.&quot; depending on whether they originated in the House or Senate, respectively. 

This means that two different bills can have the same number. Each two-year span is called a &quot;congress&quot;, tracking the terms of Representatives elected in the nationwide biennial House of Representatives elections, and each congress is divided into year-long periods called &quot;sessions&quot;.

<doc id="377412" wikidata="Q232380" url="?curid=377412" title="Julia Soaemias">
<text>Julia Soaemias Bassiana (180 – 11 March 222) was a Syrian noblewoman and the mother of Roman emperor Elagabalus, who ruled over the Roman Empire from 218 to 222. She was one of his chief advisors, initially with the support and accompaniment of her mother Julia Maesa. She and her mother guided the young emperor until growing unrest and a family division led to her son&#x27;s replacement by her nephew Severus Alexander. Julia Soaemias was killed along with her son by the Praetorian Guard. 

Julia Soaemias was born and raised in Emesa, Syria and through her mother was related to the Royal family of Emesa, and through marriage, to the Severan dynasty of Ancient Rome.

==Family==
She was the first daughter of the powerful Syrian Roman noblewoman Julia Maesa and Gaius Julius Avitus Alexianus, sister of Julia Avita Mamaea, niece of Julia Domna, and a niece by marriage of Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus.

At some point, she married Syrian equestrian and politician Sextus Varius Marcellus, a native of Apamea. As members of the imperial Roman family of the Severan dynasty, they resided in Rome, and Julia&#x27;s husband rose to the Roman senate. Julia bore Marcellus at least two children: only one is known by name, Sextus Varius Avitus Bassianus, who became the Roman emperor Elagabalus.

Her husband died in c. 215, during his time as Roman governor in Numidia. The recently widowed Soaemias and her children later dedicated a tombstone to him, which was found in Velletri, not far from Rome. The tombstone has two preserved bilingual inscriptions in Latin and Greek. The inscriptions reveal his political career, his various titles, designations and distinctions he received.

==In Rome==
===Background===
In 217, her maternal cousin, the Roman emperor Caracalla, was killed and Macrinus ascended to the imperial throne. Her family was allowed to return to Syria with their enormous wealth, and they returned to Emesa. Back in Emesa, her son, Bassianus, ascended as the chief priest of the Syrian deity Elagabalus.

===Restoration of the Severan dynasty===

Using her enormous wealth and the claim that Caracalla had slept with her daughter and that the boy was his bastard, Julia Maesa, Soaemias&#x27;s mother, persuaded soldiers from The Gallic Third Legion stationed near Emesa to swear loyalty to Bassianus. Later, Bassianus was invited alongside his mother and her daughters to the military camp, clad in imperial purple and crowned as emperor by the soldiers.
Cassius Dio records a different story, citing that Gannys, a &quot;youth who has not yet reached manhood&quot; and the lover of Soaemias was the reason for the revolt. Since the boy&#x27;s father was no longer alive, Gannys acted as the boy&#x27;s protector and foster father, and late at night, he dressed him in Caracalla&#x27;s clothing and smuggled him to camp, without either Maesa or Soaemias&#x27;s knowledge, and persuaded the soldiers to swear loyalty to him. 

The story is likely a fabrication, seeing as it is unlikely that Maesa, who has much to gain if her grandson would become emperor, would be totally unaware of the coup, Herodian&#x27;s story, which tells that the coup was handled by Maesa and her family alone is also unlikely, seeing that Dio&#x27;s story tells that the boy later had the support of many Equestrians and Senators from Emesa, which was most likely.

Whatever the circumstances for Elagabalus&#x27;s rise to the purple were, he later rode to battle against Macrinus, and entered the city of Antioch emerging as emperor, with Macrinus fleeing, before being captured near Chalcedon and executed in Cappadocia.

===Reign of Elagabalus===

Bassianus emerged as emperor and was styled &quot;Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus&quot;. Soaemias, his mother, was styled as &quot;Iulia Soaemias Augusta&quot;. Elagabalus as emperor was mainly concerned with religious matters, and as sun worship had increased throughout the Empire since the reign of his maternal great-uncle by marriage, Septimius Severus, Elagabalus and his mother saw this as an opportunity to install Elagabal as the chief deity of the Roman pantheon. The god was renamed &quot;Deus Sol Invictus&quot;, meaning &quot;God of the Undefeated Sun&quot;, and was honored even above Jupiter. 

Elagabalus and his entourage spent the winter of 218 in Bithynia at Nicomedia, where the emperor&#x27;s religious beliefs first presented themselves as a problem. The contemporary historian Cassius Dio suggests that Gannys was killed by the new emperor because he pressured Elagabalus to live &quot;temperately and prudently&quot;. To help Romans adjust to having an oriental priest as emperor, Julia Maesa (Soaemias&#x27;s mother) had a painting of Elagabalus in priestly robes sent to Rome and hung over a statue of the goddess Victoria in the Senate House. This placed senators in the awkward position of having to make offerings to Elagabalus whenever they made offerings to Victoria.

The duo attempted to gain popularity with Roman religion, and as a token of respect, joined either Astarte, Minerva, or Urania to Elagabal as his consort. Julia Soaemias and her mother feature in literary accounts of Elagabaus&#x27;s reign, and were credited with exercising much influence. Julia Soaemias and her mother significantly assisted the emperor, and appeared in the Senate beside Elagabalus during his adoption of Severus Alexander. She assumed the senatorial title of &quot;clarissima&quot; and also held a &quot;Women&#x27;s Senate&quot; deciding on matters of fashion and protocol. She was honored with various titles, honours and privileges, including &#x27;Augusta, mater Augusti&#x27; (Augusta, mother of Augustus) and &#x27;Mater castrorum et senatus et totius domus divinae&#x27; (Mother of camp and the senate and the all divine house). 

Their rule was not popular, and soon discontent arose, mainly because of the strange sexual behaviour and the Eastern religious practices of Elagabalus. Elagabalus lost the favour of both the Praetorian Guard and the senate, mainly because of his many eccentricities. In particular his relationship with Hierocles increasingly provoked the Praetorians. When Elagabalus&#x27; grandmother Julia Maesa perceived that popular support for the emperor was waning, she decided that he and his mother, who had encouraged his religious practices, had to be replaced. As alternatives, she turned to her other daughter, Julia Avita Mamaea, and her grandson, the thirteen-year-old Severus Alexander.

===Controversy and transition of power===
Maesa arranged for Elagabalus to appoint his cousin Severus Alexander as his heir and to give him the title of &quot;Caesar&quot;. Alexander shared the consulship with the emperor that year. Elagabalus reconsidered this arrangement when he began to suspect that the Praetorian Guard preferred his cousin to himself.

==Death==
After failing in various attempts to slay his cousin, Elagabalus decided to strip Alexander of his titles and revoked his consulship. Elagabalus then invented the rumor that Alexander was near death, in order to see how the Praetorians would react. A riot ensued, and the Guard demanded to see Elagabalus and Alexander in the Praetorian camp. 

Julia Soaemias entered the camp to protect her son, and was slain along with Elagabalus by the Praetorian Guard in 222. Their bodies were dragged through the streets and disposed of in the Tiber River. Julia Soaemias was later declared a public enemy and her name erased from all records.

<doc id="377415" wikidata="Q235090" url="?curid=377415" title="Julia Avita Mamaea">
<text>Julia Avita Mamaea or Julia Mamaea (14 or 29 August around 182 – March 21/22 235) was a Syrian noble woman and member of the Severan dynasty. She was the mother of Roman emperor Alexander Severus and remained one of his chief advisors throughout his reign. She was killed in 235 by rebel soldiers alongside her son.

==Family==
Julia Avita Mamaea was the second daughter of Julia Maesa, a powerful Roman woman of Syrian origin, and Syrian noble Gaius Julius Avitus Alexianus. She was a niece of empress Julia Domna, emperor Lucius Septimius Severus, and sister of Julia Soaemias Bassiana. She was born and raised in Emesa (modern Homs, Syria), where her family was very powerful.

Julia&#x27;s first husband was an unknown former consul who died. Her only undisputed child, Severus Alexander, whom she gave birth to on October 1, 208 in Arca Caesarea, may have been from this marriage instead of her second as Dio claimed. She then married her second husband, a Syrian promagistrate named Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus from Arca Caesarea (Arqa in Lebanon). She may have had a son named Marcus Julius Gessius Bassianus and a daughter named Theoclia with him.

When her cousin, emperor Caracalla, was killed near Carrhae, Macrinus proclaimed himself emperor. Mamaea&#x27;s mother Maesa and sister Soaemias organized a revolt against Macrinus to declare Soaemias&#x27; son, Varius Avitus Bassianus (Elagabalus), as emperor. As a response, Macrinus&#x27;s camp killed a number of individuals with connections to Elagabalus, including Mamaea&#x27;s husband Gessius, around 218. Julia provided education of her son Alexander, before his becoming emperor of Rome. Alexander thought much of his mother&#x27;s advice and followed what she told him to do.

==Reign of Elagabalus (218-222)==

As a member of the imperial Roman family, under the authority of her aunt Julia Domna, she closely watched the death of her cousin Caracalla and the ascension of her nephew Elagabalus: the oldest grandson of Julia Maesa and initially, her favorite. When Elagabalus successfully overthrew Macrinus and reigned as emperor, Mamaea and her son are described as being present at the imperial court, where her mother Julia Maesa and sister Julia Soaemias, the mother of Elagabalus, also lived. Due to his unorthodox behavior, Elagabalus and Julia Soaemias alienated the Praetorian Guard and their favor instead fell on Alexander, Mamaea&#x27;s son. Mamaea distributed gold to the Praetorians to usher up support for her son, and guarded him against plots devised by the increasingly desperate Elagabalus. Elagabalus&#x27; continued machinations against Alexander spurred Praetorians to murder Elagabalus, and Alexander became emperor in 222.

==The reign of Alexander==
Julia Mamaea and her mother Maesa played an instrumental role in the imperial accession of Alexander, then 13 years old, by securing the Praetorians&#x27; loyalty to him. They remained influential figures during his reign. Julia Mamaea attained the title &quot;Augusta&quot; immediately following his acquisition of the throne. When Maesa died in 224, Mamaea took over the state affairs alongside an advisory board.

The two women had collaborated in choosing 16 distinguished senators to form this advisory board and relied heavily on the lawyer Ulpian, who was also from Syria. This created a court environment in which the advisory board ran the Roman Empire with Alexander as the mere figurehead. The new regime garnered the approval of surviving historical sources for overturning Elagabalus&#x27; measures and reinstating a more traditional form of government. Ulpian, who held influence during Alexander&#x27;s early reign, was made head of the Praetorian Guard. However, he was unable to control the Praetorians, who eventually rebelled. Despite the swift flight to the palace under the protection of Julia Mamaea and Severus Alexander, Ulpian was murdered around 223 or 228.

Upon reaching adulthood, Alexander confirmed his esteem for his mother and listened to her advice. She accompanied her son in his campaigns, and like her aunt Julia Domna, she too held many titles in addition to &quot;Augusta&quot;: &quot;mater augusti nostri et castrorum et senatus et patriae&quot; (&quot;mother of the emperor, the camp, the senate and the country&quot;) and &quot;mater universi generis humani&quot; (&quot;mother of the all humanity&quot;). The historian Herodian and text &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; characterize Alexander as a mama&#x27;s boy who never managed to escape her maternal domination but that he resented her love of money. Mamaea&#x27;s influence over him led some sources to call him Alexander Mamaeae. Though she was credited with her son&#x27;s principled upbringing and the stability during his early reign, the army and ancient historians attributed Alexander&#x27;s military shortcomings to Mamaea. By preventing his exposure to battles as a protective measure, Mamaea may have contributed to her son&#x27;s deteriorating relationship with the army.

According to Herodian, Mamaea had become jealous of her daughter-in-law, Sallustia Orbiana, whom Alexander married in 225, and whose father Seius Sallustius had been possibly made &quot;caesar&quot;, because she disapproved that there was another &quot;Augusta&quot;. In epigraphical dedications, Mamaea was systematically given precedence over Orbiana. Herodian writes Julia Mamaea had Orbiana expelled from the palace and had her father executed, against the will of Alexander Severus, because his mother had too much influence over him and he obeyed all her orders. However, the same historian conflictingly credits Mamaea for selecting Orbiana as an &quot;Augusta&quot;. The downfall of Orbiana&#x27;s father, a result of his hostile relation with Mamaea, and the murder of Ulpian are two episodes which demonstrate the prevalence of political intrigues in Alexander&#x27;s early reign. 

Mamaea called on Origen, the Alexandrian Christian leader, to provide her with instructions in Christian doctrine.

== Death ==
After an inconclusive expedition to repel a Persian invasion in 232, Julia Mamaea and Alexander went north to deal with a German attack. Alexander alienated the Rhine legions by his lack of military prowess and his inflexibility towards pay demands, leading to the troops proclaiming Maximinus Thrax emperor in 235. The army also blamed Mamaea for Alexander&#x27;s passiveness and stinginess. On March 21, troops sent to kill Alexander found him clinging to Mamaea in a tent, where he is said to have been blaming her for his upcoming death. The mother and son were murdered together, ending the Severan dynasty. The following regime placed them under &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;.

A sarcophagus was found within the Monte Del Grano by excavators, and later installed in 1590 to the courtyard of the Palazzo Dei Conservatori. While this was considered to be that of Mamaea and Alexander in older traditions, this identification has been doubted, as the representation of the sculptural figures follows the conventions of a married couple. Today, the sarcophagus can be found in the Capitoline Museums in Rome.

<text>Nishapur or Neyshabur (, also ) is a city in the Central District of Nishapur County, Razavi Khorasan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

Nishapur is the second most populous city of the province in the northeast of Iran, situated in a fertile plain at the foot of Binalud Mountain Range. It has been the historic capital of the Western Quarter of Greater Khorasan, the historic capital of the 9th-century Tahirid dynasty, the initial capital of the 11th-century Seljuk Empire, and is currently the capital city of Nishapur County and a historic Silk Road city of cultural and economic importance in Iran and the Greater Khorasan region.

Nearby are turquoise mines that have supplied the world with turquoise of the finest and the highest quality for at least two millennia.

The city was founded in the 3rd century by Shapur I as a capital city of Sasanian satrapy known as Abarshahr or Nishapur. The city later became the capital of Tahirid dynasty and was reformed by Abdullah Tahir in 830, and later selected as the capital of Seljuk dynasty by Tughril in 1037. Nishapur had a territory of 17.6 hectares and 25,000 people in the 6th century, while by the year 1000, the population of the city was about 336,000 people with the territory of 1,680 hectares. From the Abbasid era to the Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran, the city evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center within the Islamic world. Nishapur, along with Merv, Herat and Balkh, was one of the four great cities of Greater Khorasan and one of the greatest cities of the Old World in the Islamic Golden Age with strategic importance, a seat of governmental power in the eastern section of caliphates, a dwelling place for diverse ethnic and religious groups and a trading stop on commercial routes from Transoxiana, China, Iraq and Egypt.

Nishapur reached the height of its prosperity under the Samanids in the 10th century but was destroyed and most of its population was slaughtered by the Mongols in 1221. This massacre, combined with subsequent earthquakes and other invasions, is believed to have destroyed the city several times. Unlike its near neighbor Merv, Nishapur managed to recover from these cataclysmic events, and survive until the present day as an active modern city and county in tourism, agriculture, healthcare, industrial production and commerce in Razavi Khorasan Province of Iran; however, many of its older and historical archeological remains are left to be uncovered.

The modern city of Nishapur is composed of three main administrative areas/districts (Persian: منطقه های شهر نیشابور) and is surrounded by many villages which are joining in to the urban area and structure of the city. The Area/district 1 of the city comprises the newer urban developments (initiated mostly in the 1980s and the 1990s) made to the north of the Road 44 and is home to most of the main higher educational institutions of Nishapur such as the University of Neyshabur and the IAUN. The Area/district 2 of the city comprises the downtown of the city and the older and more historic urban structures situated on the south of the Road 44. It is home to some of the main tourists attractions of the city such as the National Garden of Nishapur and the Khanate Mansion of Amin Islami. The Area/district 3 of the city is home to the ruins and the remains of the ancient city of Nishapur destroyed by Mongols in the Middle Ages and is located on the south and the southeast of the city. The third district of the city is a national and registered protected archeological area by law and any unauthorized archeological excavation is considered illegal. This district is also home to the burial and historical monuments (some are shown on the city infobox) of most of the renowned persons of the city throughout history such as the Mausoleum of Omar Khayyám and the Mausoleum of Attar of Nishapur. The third district is also used as one of the main touristic hotspots of the city.

Many of this city&#x27;s archeological discoveries are held and shown to the public in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the British Museum in London, the National Museum of Iran in Tehran, other international museums and the museums of the city of Nishapur. The city of Nishapur is also a member of international organizations such as the LHC and the ICCN UNESCO.
== History ==

=== Abarshahr of Sassanid Empire ===
Abarshahr was a satrapy (province) of the Sassanid Empire. Cities in the region were Candac, Artacauan, Apameia, and Pushang (founded by Shapur I). Nishapur was the capital. Abarshar was the name used for Nishapur during the Sassanid Empire and Rashidun Caliphate. The capital was a vital center of administration and of communications between Bactria, India, and Sagistan. The region was involved in the Indian and Chinese trade. Its governor bore the title of kanarang.

=== Names of Nishapur throughout history ===
*Abarshahr or Aparshahr was a satrapy (province) of the Sassanid Empire now located in Nishapur. Cities in the region were Candac, Artacauan, and Apameia, and Pushang (founded by Shapur I) and the capital was Nishapur. Abarshar was the name of Nishapur during the Sassanid Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate. The capital was a vital point of administration and of communications between Bactria, India, and Sagistan. The region was involved in the Indian and Chinese trade. Its governor bore the unique title of kanarang.
*Neysabur or Naysabur was named Abarshahr during the Muslim occupation of Khorasan and Nishapur, and was the city&#x27;s official name during the Rashidun Caliphate, Umayyad Caliphate, and Abbasid Caliphate.

=== Middle Ages ===

==== Muslim Conquest ====
Nishapur was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, without struggle, during the caliphate of Umar. The Caliph appointed Ahnaf Ibn Qais as the chief command of the Rashidun army out of Isfahan. From Isfahan, two routes led to Khorasan: the main route via Rayy and the other via Nishapur. The people of Nishapur chose not to fight and surrendered on the condition of paying a tribute.

Having conquered the region around Nishapur, the Muslim force advanced to Nishapur itself. The city was divided into four sectors, with each sector under a Persian chief. These chiefs shut themselves in the city and closed the gates. The Muslims laid siege to the city for some days. In the meantime, the Persian chiefs quarreled among themselves. One of the chiefs entered into negotiations with the Muslims. He offered to open one of the gates for the Muslim army to enter, provided he was granted immunity. The Muslims accepted the offer. The Persians were taken by surprise, and the Muslims became the new rulers of Nishapur. After consolidating their position at Nishapur, the Muslims conquered other cities around Nishapur, including Pusht, Ashband, Rukh, Zar, Khaf, Osparain and Arghian.

==== Nishapur capital of Abu Muslim ====
Abu Muslim became the governor of Khorasan, and chose Nishapur as his capital. He seems to have initiated a huge building program in which he stimulated the growth of the city. Nishapur increased in importance, and two of the ‘Abbasids were governors of this city before becoming caliphs. It was the governor of Khurasan (‘Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan) who presented the large gift of Chinese imperial porcelains to Harun al-Rashid (see Abbasid Ceramics Section), demonstrating the strategic importance of the province on trade routes.

==== Tahirid dynasty in Nishapur ====
The Tahirid dynasty was a dynasty of Persian dehqan origin that ruled from 820 to 872 in Khorasan, northeastern Greater Iran, a region now split between Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The Tahirid capital was originally Merv, but Nishapur became their capital from 828 to 845. Although nominally subject to the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad, the Tahirid rulers were effectively independent. The dynasty was founded by Tahir ibn Husayn, a leading general in the service of the Abbasid caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun. Tahir&#x27;s military victories were rewarded with the gift of lands in the east of Persia, which were subsequently extended by his successors as far as the borders of India. Tahirid influence extended to Baghdad when the Abbasids granted them the military affairs in Mesopotamia. 

==== Saffarids/Samanids/Seljuks ====
In 873, the Tahirids were replaced by the Saffarids. Saffarids expanded their sphere of influence through the north of Khurasan and also in south towards Sistan. They also made Nishapur their capital and rebuilt the Tahirid palace. In 900, Ismail Samani defeated the Saffarids and was made governor of Nishapur. The Samanids had been placed in power in Transoxiana by Caliph Al-Ma&#x27;mun, and ruled first from Samarqand and then moved to Bukhara. After defeating the Saffarids, their &quot;empire&quot;, with nominal sanction from the Abbasids, extended from India to Iraq, making Nishapur a provincial capital. Khurasan was thus an international entrepôt, with merchants coming not only from Iraq, India and Egypt, but also from Russia; additionally, Vikings came from Scandinavia to trade with the Bulghars and Khazars on the Caspian Sea.
Nishapur occupies an important strategic position astride the old Silk Road that linked Anatolia and the Mediterranean Sea with China. On the Silk Road, Nishapur has often defined the flexible frontier between the Iranian plateau and Central Asia. The town derived its name from its reputed founder, the Sassanian king Shapur I, who is said to have established it in the third century CE. Nearby are the turquoise mines that supplied the world with turquoise for at least two millennia.

It became an important town in the Greater Khorasan region but subsequently declined in significance until a revival in its fortunes in the 9th century under the Tahirid dynasty, when the glazed ceramics of Nishapur formed an important item of trade to the west. For a time Nishapur rivaled Baghdad or Cairo: Toghrül, the first ruler of the Seljuk dynasty, made Nishapur his residence in 1038 and proclaimed himself sultan there, but it declined thereafter, as Seljuk fortunes were concentrated in the west. Nishapur was sacked by the Oghuz Turks in 1154, killing 30,000 people. Nishapur suffered several earthquakes in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

==== Mongol siege of Nishapur ====

In 1221, after the death of Tuqachar, the husband of Genghis Khan&#x27;s daughter, the entire city of Nishapur was destroyed by the Mongols over the course of 10 days. Genghis Khan&#x27;s daughter requested the death of every resident of the city as vengeance for her husband&#x27;s death. In order to become sure that no wounded would survive the massacre, Khan&#x27;s troops killed and beheaded most of the population of the city and their skulls were reputedly piled in pyramids by the Mongols. Women, Infants, children, and even cats and dogs were among the beheaded. It is estimated that potentially up to 1,747,000 people were slaughtered.

After the massacre a much smaller settlement was established just north of the ancient town, and the once bustling metropolis lay underground—until a team of excavators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art arrived in the mid-20th century. They worked at Nishapur between 1935 and 1940, returning for a final season in the winter of 1947–48. What remains of old Nishapur is a 3500-hectare &quot;Kohandejh (Persian: کهن دژ)&quot; area, south of the current city of Nishapur.

==== Ilkhanate and Timurid reign ====
After the fall of Nishapur in 1221 by the Mongols, the structures of the city were weakened and the agricultural output of the city was reduced. Mahmud Ghazan and Abu Sa&#x27;id Bahadur Khan tried to make the city flourish again and the city&#x27;s population grew once more and some of the villages around the city were improved and rebuilt. Hamdallah Mustawfi had visited the city of Nishapur in the Year 1339 or 1340. During this era, the ambassador of Henry III of Castile, Ruy González de Clavijo reached Nishapur and according to him, Nishapur had become a highly productive agricultural center with 40 non-stop working mills along the &quot;Abe Bostan&quot; (Mir Ab River of Nishapur). The current position of the city was formed during this era and on the North West of the older position of the city which is now home to the Mausoleum of Attar of Nishapur and Shadiyakh Archeological Site and other remains of the old position of the city (the old position of the city is also now a protected archeological site by law though it is endangered). Mausoleum of Attar of Nishapur and the Jame mosque of Nishapur (congregational mosque of the city) are among the examples of the buildings built during this era in Nishapur. Many poets, scholars and renowned historical figures of the city and the wider region of Abarshahr (one of the main four regions of Greater Khorasan with the city capitals of Nishapur, Merv, Herat and Balkh) were also born in this period.

=== Early modern era ===

==== Safavid Era (16th to early 18th century) ====

Due to a conflict between the supporters of the Mohammad Khodabanda, the Safavid Shah of Persia, and his son Abbas the Great. In 1581, the castle of Nishapur went under siege. This siege became one of the events that helped the Abbas the Great to become the Ruler of Greater Khorasan and later the Shah of Persia in the Safavid Empire. In 1592 Abbas the Great took back the control of Nishapur from the Shaybanids. Shah Abbasi Caravanseri of Nishapur was also built during his reign and later on, he left his two epigraphs on Jame Mosque of Nishapur on the Ramadan of October 1612.

Saadat Ali Khan I Nishapuri, Nawab of Awadh (the ruler who governed the state of Awadh of India), was also born in this period in an influential family in Nishapur.

==== Independence and Qajar Era (18th &amp; 19th century) ====

After the death of Nader Shah Afshar in 1747, the area became an independent khanate under the reign of the Bayat chieftains. In 1754 Ahmad Shah Durrani captured Nishapur with the support of heavy artillery and imposed Shahrokh Shah as the ruler (Shah) of the western part of Greater Khorasan as a protectorate of the Durrani Empire.

The city was conquered in 1800 by the Qajars. In 1828, the city came under the influence of the Zafaranlu Confederacy but was given back to the Qajars in 1829. During the Revolt of Hasan Khan Salar, the city was an isolated outpost of Qajar rule led by Imamverdi Khan Bayat when most of Khorasan was under the wrath of Hasan Khan Salar. On March 21, 1849, Qajar forces entered Nishapur.

=== Contemporary history ===

==== Pahlavi dynasty ====

The reconstruction of the Mausoleum of Omar Khayyam in Nishapur was commissioned by Reza Shah. Omar&#x27;s previous tomb was separated from his tomb, and a white marble monument (Current Mausoleum), designed by the Iranian architect Hooshang Seyhoun, was erected over it. This mausoleum became one of the main symbols of the city and one of the known works of the modern Persian architecture. The influence of the architectural design of this mausoleum is visible on the coat of arms of the University of Neyshabur, Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences (NUMS) and other public, civil and private organizations of the city. The construction of the new mausoleum was completed in the year 1963. The Tomb of Kamal-ol Molk was also built in Nishapur and designed by Seyhoun. The Wooden Mosque of Neyshabur was also built in the year 2000.

The Second Asia-Pacific Jamboree was held at Baghrud Scots Park of Nishapur in preparation for The 15th World Scout Jamboree which was scheduled to be held 15–23 July 1979 in Nishapur but due to the political uncertainty of the Iranian Revolution in the country, the event was cancelled.

==== Post Iranian revolution ====
On February 18, 2004, in the Nishapur train disaster, a train carrying flammable goods derailed and caught fire near the town. Five hours later, during fire fighting and rescue work, a massive explosion destroyed the train and many nearby buildings. Around 300 people were said to have been killed, mainly fire and rescue workers but also the local governor and mayor and the heads of the fire and rail services. This disaster has become known as one of the worst railway industry disasters of the world.

==== Archaeological discoveries ====
Little archaeology has been done on this vast and complicated site. George Curzon remarked that Nishapur had been destroyed and rebuilt more times than any other city in history, an evocative statement whether or not it is statistically true. The Metropolitan Museum of Art undertook excavations from 1935 that were interrupted in 1940. Searching largely for museum-worthy trophies that they shared with the government of the Shah, the Metropolitan&#x27;s publications were limited to its own Nishapur ceramics. The site of Nishapur has been ransacked for half a century since World War II, to feed the international market demand for early Islamic works of art.

Shadiyakh (&quot;Palace of Happiness&quot;) was one of the main palaces of old Nishapur up to the 9th century AD, which became more important and populated after that. Some notable people like Attar lived there. Attar&#x27;s tomb is nowadays in that area. This palace was perhaps completely ruined in the 13th century.

==Demographics==
=== Language ===
Most people speak Persian and are monolingual, however, there are several private foreign language-teaching institutions in the city that teach English and other languages.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 205,972 in 56,652 households. The following census in 2011 counted 239,185 people in 71,263 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 264,375 people in 83,143 households. It is the third most-populous city in the eastern provinces of Iran after Mashhad and Zahedan.

== Geography ==

Nishapur is located at an elevation of 1250 meters on a wide fertile plain at the southwestern foot of the Binalud Mountain range in northcentral Razavi Khorasan Province. The city is connected by both railways and highways to the cities of Mashhad and Tehran. The city also has local routes and highways to the cities of Kashmar and Quchan.

=== Sources of the Middle Ages ===
Throughout the Middle Ages, Nishapur had been praised by many due to its many gardens and its healthy climate in Khorasan. Ibn Hawqal has commented the following about the weather and the climate of this city at that time:Throughout all of Khorasan, no such companion as enriched with the health of the air, quantity and the vastness of its mansions can be found.In the same cited work, Hakim Nishapuri praises Nishapur with many favourable nicknames such as &quot;&quot; and compares and claims that the weather and climate (or air Persian: هوا) of Nishapur was better and more healthier (according to him, cholera and other such diseases and disasters could not be found in Nishapur) than many neighboring regions such as Sistan (due to its winds), Indus valley (or سند in Persian) and Hindustan (due to their severe hotness), Khwarazm and Turkestan (due to their coldness) and Merv (due to presence of many insects).

=== Modern ===
Nishapur generally has a warm and semi-dry climate called &quot;central Iranian plateau climate&quot;. Precipitation mostly happens in spring and winter. Nishapur is situated on a relatively higher elevation (1250 meters) than its neighboring cities such Sabzevar and Mashhad hence the weather is milder and better than these cities.

=== Climate ===
Nishapur has a cold semi-arid climate (BSk). 

=== Geology ===

The city of Nishapur lies on a Holocene alluvial plain on top of the Pleistocene sediments in the southwestern part of the Binalud Mountains. The Binalud Range, running northwest–southeast, is made predominantly of Triassic and Jurassic rocks. On the southern side of the northwestern part of the range there is a section of Eocene rocks that are volcanic in origin. The well-known Nishabur turquoise comes from the weathered and broken trachytes and andesites of the Eocene volcanic rocks of this part of the mountain range. The main turquoise mines are situated about 50 kilometers northwest of the city of Nishapur in the foothills of the Binalud Range.

=== Seismicity ===
Nishapur is located in a region with a rather high risk of earthquakes. Many earthquakes have seriously harmed the city; among the important ones are the historical earthquakes that ruined the city in the 12th and 13th centuries.

== Economy ==

The economy of Nishapur is diverse and it is based on several industries like Agriculture, Industrial parks, mining, tourism, health-care, retailing, banking etc.

=== Food &amp; Agriculture ===
Many agricultural products such as saffron, cereals, cotton, herbs, plums, walnut, wheat, corn, apples, cherries and pistachio are exported from the county of Nishapur. The city is also a dairy and sugar exporter.

==== Water supply ====
Most of the water supply of the city is provided from the Binalud Mountain Range&#x27;s mostly seasonal rivers, qanats, dams and modern wells.

=== Mining ===

== Culture ==
=== Mythology and religion ===

Nishapur has been of importance in Iranian mythology. Before the Islamization of Iran, Zoroastrianism had been the major religion of Nishapur. Rivand (one of the ancient names of Nishapur) has been mentioned in Avesta and subsequently in Shahnameh. Adur Burzen-Mihr a Zoroastrian fire temple of the highest grade was situated in Rivand Mountains (Binalud mountains) of Nishapur and the lake Rivand of Nishapur was built due to a fight between Ahriman and water (probably by water it was meant Anahita in the Persian text of the Persian wiki). Also, according to Hakim Nishapuri, Dež-e Sɑngi was built by Seth on a giant round soft (flat) stone There are also signs of the influence of Christianity in Nishapur (a street in Nishapur has been called and is still called Masih and also a village on the south of the city was called Masih Abad). After the rise of Islam however, the people living in and near the city of Neyshabur became Muslims. Nishapur and its people have also had an influence on Sufism (an Islamic mystic practice). Poets and Sufis such as Attar of Nishapur who had been born in this city had had a profound influence on Islamic mysticism. In the 10th century, Nishapur had been one of the centers of Ismaili missionary spread in Iran and Greater Khorasan. Most of the Ismailis of Nishapur now live in Dizbad and some in the main city itself. Jama&#x27;at Khana Dizbad is the most important Ismaili center in Nishapur today. From the third to the sixth of Hejri Ghamari, Nishapur was one of the centers of Sufism. Most Sufis and Sufi elders in Nishapur were Sunnis and followers of the Shafi&#x27;i school.

During the 10th century, Nishapur was a thriving economic center home to many religious scholars and artists. Nishapur was located along the Silk Road. An influential trade route connecting China to the Mediterranean Sea. It was a center for cotton, silk, textile and ceramic production. In efforts to uncover the history of life in this city, the Metropolitan Museum of Art put together an excavation team composed of researchers Joseph Upton, Walter Hauser and Charles Wilkinson. From 1935 to 1940, the team worked to rediscover the ancient city. They were authorized to work under the conditions that half of the material found must be shared with the Iran Bastan Museum in Tehran. Along with pottery, excavators uncovered glass, metalwork, coins and decorated wall fragments. Over the years of excavations, thousands of items were uncovered which provided information on local artistic traditions.

=== Tepe Madraseh ===
The most elaborate architectural excavation took place at the site called Tepe Madraseh. This massive complex had been thoughtfully planned and embellished with many decorative elements. Plaster panels had been carved and painted, along with walls, brickwork and glazed ceramic tiles. A madraseh is a place for religious learning. Such sites have piqued the interest of scholars for centuries for their function and architectural designs. Like most Islamic architecture the entire complex of Tepe Madaseh was oriented to face Mecca. The bricks used to construct most of the structures had been dried in the kilns located on the outskirts of the complex.

=== Pottery ===
Nishapur during the Islamic Golden Age, especially the 9th and 10th centuries, was one of the great centers of pottery and related arts. Most of the Ceramic artifacts discovered in Nishapur are preserved in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museums in Nishapur, Tehran and Mashhad. Ceramics produced at Nishapur showed links with Sassanid art and Central Asian. Nowadays there are 4 Pottery workshops in Nishapur.

Bowls including bold black inscriptions in the so-called Kufic angular calligraphy were apparently produced in the important ceramic centers of Nishapur in eastern Iran, and Afrasiyab, or Old Samarqand, in present-day Uzbekistan. The text often contains a proverb in Arabic or, as in this case, a series of wishes: &quot;Blessing, happiness, prosperity, good health, and success.&quot;

=== Form and function of Nishapur pottery ===
&quot;Although the decoration of pottery may only tell us a little about the people who used it, the form of a vessel is directly related to its function&quot;. The Pottery of Nishapur incorporated strong colored slips and bold patterns. Common decoration included geometric and vegetal patterns, calligraphy, figures and animals. The ceramic pieces uncovered at Nishapur consisted mainly of vessels and utilitarian wares. Objects such as plates, bowls, bottles, jars, pitchers, coin banks and even a toy hen were found. One decorative technique specifically utilized by Nishapur potters was the refined use of chattering, a rippled texture achieved when trimming a vessel on the wheel. The polychrome ware of Nishapur indicates the significant advances in glaze technology that were being discovered during the 10th century. It also indicates how an objects aesthetic became an important part of the piece as a whole.

A selection of these discoveries is shown in the gallery below:

=== Anthem of Nishapur ===

Foreign writers such as André Gide (in &quot;The Fruits of the Earth&quot;) and Jorge Luis Borges have also mentioned this city in their work(s).

=== Music ===
Throughout history, music in Nishapur has been influenced by Sassanid, Maqami and traditional styles and is a part of the Khorasani Folk Music that has been popular in Nishapur. Following the UNESCO World Register of Maqami Music in Northern Khorasan, research on music in Nishapur has been considered. Maghami music festivals have been also active in Nishapur. One of the oldest study sources related to Iranian music is Resal-e Neyshaburi (in Persian:رساله نیشابور) written by Mohammad bin Mahmoud of Nishapur, which highlights the importance of music in old Nishapur. Among the influential people of Nishapur in music Ratebe Neyshaburi (during the reign of Tahirids), and the contemporary Parviz Meshkatian can be named.

=== Turquoise masonry ===

For at least 2,000 years, Iran, known before as Persia, has remained an important source of turquoise, which was named by Iranians initially &quot;pirouzeh&quot; meaning &quot;victory&quot; and later after Arab invasion &quot;firouzeh&quot;. As an important source of turquoise, Nishapur has been sometimes referred to as the &quot;city of turquoise&quot; throughout history. In Iranian architecture, the blue turquoise was used to cover the domes of the Iranian palaces because its intense blue color was also a symbol of heaven on earth.

This deposit, which is blue naturally, and turns green when heated due to dehydration, is restricted to a mine-riddled region in Nishapur, the mountain peak of Ali-mersai, which is tens of kilometers from Mashhad, the capital of Khorasan province, Iran. Nishapur&#x27;s turquoise has been sold as souvenirs and jewelry in Nishapur and Mashhad. A weathered and broken trachyte is host to the turquoise, which is found both &quot;in situ&quot; between layers of limonite and sandstone, and amongst the scree at the mountain&#x27;s base. These workings, together with those of the Sinai Peninsula, are the oldest known.

<doc id="377428" wikidata="Q816717" url="?curid=377428" title="Benazir Bhutto International Airport">
<text>Benazir Bhutto International Airport (, ) is an airport which formerly served the Islamabad–Rawalpindi metropolitan area. It was the second-largest airport by air traffic in Pakistan, until 1 May 2018 when it was replaced by the new Islamabad International Airport. Also known as Chaklala Airbase, it was renamed after the late Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto (1953–2007) in June 2008. The airport handled 4,767,860 passengers in 2015–16, compared to 3,610,566 in 2010–11.

The airport was located in the area of Chaklala in Rawalpindi, which neighbours Islamabad. Following the establishment of the new Islamabad International Airport, the airport is no longer used for civil aviation and now forms a part of the adjoining PAF Base Nur Khan (also known as PAF Base Chaklala).

==History==

In March 2006, Pakistan International Airlines launched a direct flight from Islamabad to Toronto on Boeing 777s. In the fiscal year 2008–2009, over 3,136,664 passengers used the Benazir Bhutto International Airport and 34,025 aircraft movements were registered. The airport served as a hub for the flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines. It was also the hub of Shaheen Air and a focus city of Airblue.

In January 2015, the government launched a Rs. 399 million project to renovate and expand the airport, including the taxi way link adjacent to the lone runway of the airport. The renovation was completed by March 2015.

The last flight to depart from this airport was PK791, operated by Pakistan International Airlines, heading for Birmingham, UK which departed at 11:39 AM PST marking the end of scheduled commercial flights to the airport.

== New airport ==

A new airport was constructed in Fateh Jang, Attock District, approximately west of the twin cities. It was built to replace the existing Benazir Bhutto International Airport in response to increasing air traffic and passenger load. It is now completed, and has become the first greenfield airport in Pakistan and the first to support the landing of an Airbus A380. Built on an area of 3,289 acres, the project consisted of 90 check-in counters and a parking facility for 2,000 vehicles and will cater to an upward of 10 million people every year in its first phase and up to 25 million in the second phase. The terminal includes 15 gates with ten remote gates, a four-star hotel, duty-free shops, two runways, six taxiways, a food court and 42 immigration counters.

The airport is connected to Islamabad via the Srinagar Highway, and Rawalpindi via the GT Road. In April 2022, the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus was expanded to connect the airport with the metropolitan area. The airport was opened for commercial flight operations on 3 May 2018.

==Facilities==
Benazir Bhutto International Airport was a civil and military airport which handled VIPs as well as scheduled public operations for many airlines. Foreign diplomats, high level government officials as well as military officials were welcomed at this airport.

The airport was only able to handle eleven wide body aircraft at one time, with an additional five parking places for general aviation aircraft. It could not accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A380 or the Boeing 747-8. This airport did not have any air bridges installed, so buses took the passengers from the airport terminal to the aircraft, where air stairs were used.

== Current status ==
Since the airport was built on an airbase, the Pakistan Air Force has taken ownership of the apron and old terminal building of the airfield in a similar fashion to when Lahore&#x27;s Allama Iqbal International Airport moved its terminals.

The runway is expected to remain in use by the PAF in the near future and VIPs and other dignitaries will continue to use the airbase instead of Islamabad International Airport.

General aviation by private companies is also expected to continue to use this airport instead of the new Islamabad International Airport.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 28 July 2010, Airblue Flight 202, a domestic flight from Karachi operated by Airbus A321 AP-BJB, crashed into the Margalla Hills in Islamabad while trying to land at the airport. The aircraft crashed into mountainous and wooded terrain near the city, killing all 152 people on board.
* On 20 April 2012, a Boeing 737-200 (AP-BKC), Bhoja Air Flight 213, which took off from Karachi&#x27;s Jinnah International Airport, was destined for Islamabad&#x27;s Benazir Bhutto International Airport, but crashed near Chaklala, killing all 127 people on board.

<text>The 1957 Rugby League World Cup was the second World Cup held for men’s national rugby league teams and was held between 15 and 25 June and hosted by Australia. Table toppers Australia were the winners as there was no Final at this World Cup.

1957 marked the 50th anniversary of rugby league in Australia but the hosts were not confident of their ability to lift the trophy, having capitulated in the Ashes series in England barely seven months previously. Great Britain, under Alan Prescott, and boasting world-class backs such as Billy Boston, Mick Sullivan, Jeff Stevenson and Lewis Jones, and a formidable pack, were expected to win with Jacques Merquey&#x27;s French side a dark horse.

Best and fairest awards were made to individual nations, the recipients being Gilbert Benausse (France), Brian Carlson (Australia), Phil Jackson (Great Britain) and Bill Sorensen (New Zealand).

== Squads ==
== Referees ==
Referee Vic Belsham from New Zealand controlled three matches at the World Cup, including controlling one of New Zealand&#x27;s matches. New Zealand included his brother Sel at halfback.

<text>The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) (; ) is the aerial warfare branch of the Pakistan Armed Forces, tasked primarily with the aerial defence of Pakistan, with a secondary role of providing air support to the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Navy when required, and a tertiary role of providing strategic airlift capability to Pakistan. , per the International Institute for Strategic Studies, the PAF has more than 70,000 active-duty personnel. PAF is the largest Air Force of the Muslim world in terms of aircraft fleet. Its primary mandate and mission is &quot;to provide, in synergy with other inter-services, the most efficient, assured and cost effective aerial defence of Pakistan.&quot; Since its establishment in 1947, the PAF has been involved in various combat operations, providing aerial support to the operations and relief efforts of the Pakistani military. Under Article 243, the Constitution of Pakistan appoints the President of Pakistan as the civilian Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces. The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), by statute a four-star air officer, is appointed by the President with the consultation and confirmation needed from the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

==History==
===1947–1950: Formative years===

The Royal Pakistan Air Force (RPAF) was established on 15 August 1947 with the independence of Pakistan from British India. The RPAF began with a paper share allotment of 2,332 personnel, a fleet of 24 Tempest II fighter-bombers, 16 Hawker Typhoon fighters, two H.P.57 Halifax bombers, two Auster aircraft, twelve North American Harvard trainers and ten de Havilland Tiger Moth biplanes. Very few were available to the RPAF on the ground as they were scattered throughout the British India to be given and collected later on. Of these very few were in flyable condition so that they could be used. Subsequently, it also got eight C-47 Dakota cargo planes which it used to transport supplies to soldiers fighting in the 1947 War in Kashmir against India. First two H.P.57 Halifax bombers were delivered in 1948 and were used during 1947 War for night-time supply drop missions at Skardu and other northern areas of Pakistan. All received against allotted at the time of independence of Pakistan from British India. It started with seven airbases scattered all over the provinces.

===1948–1954: Waziristan rebellion ===

After the partition of British India, Faqir of Ipi, a pashtun separatist leader rejected the creation of newly created Pakistan.

In 1948, the Faqir of Ipi took control of North Waziristan&#x27;s Datta Khel area and declared the establishment of an independent Pashtunistan, with support from neighbouring Kingdom of Afghanistan.

In response to the Faqir&#x27;s rebellion, Pakistan Air Force in June 1949 inadvertently bombed the Afghan village of Mughalgai on the Waziristan border with Afghanistan while chasing the Pashtunistan separatists who attacked Pakistani border posts from Afghanistan, this attack came to known as Mughalgai raid which left 23 separatists dead and further fuelled Afghan support for Pashtunistan. Faqir established Gurwek as headquarters for his activities. Faqir also established a rifle factory in Gurwek with the material support provided by the government of Afghanistan.

In 1953–1954, the PAF&#x27;s No. 14 Squadron led an operation from Miranshah airbase and heavily bombarded the Faqir of Ipi&#x27;s compound in Gurwek which ultimately forced Faqir to detach from an armed campaign against Pakistan.

===1959 Indian aerial intrusion===

On 10 April 1959, on the occasion of the Eid ul-Fitr festival holiday in Pakistan, an Indian Air Force (IAF) English Electric Canberra B(I)58 of No. 106 Squadron entered Pakistani airspace on a photo reconnaissance mission. Two PAF F-86F Sabres (Flt. Lt. M. N. Butt (leader) and Flt. Lt. M. Yunis) of No. 15 Squadron on Air Defence Alert (ADA) were scrambled from PAF Base Peshawar to intercept the IAF aircraft. Butt attempted to bring down the Canberra by firing his Sabre&#x27;s machine guns, but the Canberra was flying at an altitude of more than 50,000 feet—beyond the operational ceiling of the F-86F. When Yunis took over from his leader, the Canberra suddenly lost height while executing a turn over Rawalpindi. Yunis fired a burst that struck the Canberra at an altitude of 47,500 feet and brought it down over Rawat, marking the first direct aerial victory of the PAF. Both crew members of the IAF Canberra ejected and were captured by Pakistani authorities. They were subsequently released after remaining in detention for some time.

===1960–1961 Bajaur Campaign===

Between 1960 and 1961, Royal Afghan Army troops along with thousands of Pashtun tribesmen from Afghanistan crossed the extremely porous Pakistan–Afghanistan border and entered the semi-autonomous Bajaur Agency of Pakistan in an effort to annex the region.

The Pakistan Air Force sent F-86 Sabre jets in order to support the Pakistani Forces and local Pashtun tribesmen of Pakistan who were fighting the Afghan infiltrators. The F-86 Sabre jets also executed bombing runs on Royal Afghan Army positions in Kunar, Afghanistan, thus leading Afghan forces to fall back to the international border. Although the Royal Afghan Air Force had seven MiG-17 squadrons and another MiG-21 squadron being operationalized, no known dogfight has been recorded between the two sides.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1965===

The PAF fleet at the time consisted of 12 F-104 Starfighters, some 120 F-86 Sabres and around 20 B-57 Canberra bombers. The PAF claims to have had complete air superiority over the battle area from the second day of operations. However, IAF Air Chief Marshal Arjan Singh claimed that, despite having been qualitatively inferior to the PAF, the IAF allegedly achieved total air superiority in three days.
Many publications have credited the PAF&#x27;s successes in combat with the IAF to its U.S.-quality equipment, claiming it to be superior to the aircraft operated by the IAF and giving the PAF a &quot;qualitative advantage&quot;. This statement has been refuted by some officials in Pakistan, who say that the IAF&#x27;s MiG-21, Hawker Hunter and Folland Gnat aircraft had better performance than the PAF&#x27;s F-86 fighters, without accounting for the obvious quantitative advantage that the IAF possessed. According to retired PAF Air Commodore Sajad Haider, the F-86 Sabre was inferior in terms of both power and speed to the IAF&#x27;s Hawker Hunter.

Air Commodore Sajad Haider, who flew with No. 19 squadron also stated that the F-104 Starfighter did not deserve its reputation as &quot;the pride of the PAF&quot; because it &quot;was unsuited to the tactical environment of the region. It was a high-level interceptor designed to neutralise Soviet strategic bombers in altitudes above 40,000 feet.&quot; Nevertheless, the IAF is believed to have feared facing the Starfighter in combat despite its lack of effectiveness in comparison to the IAF&#x27;s fleet of Folland Gnats. According to Indian sources, the F-86F performed reasonably well against the IAF&#x27;s Hunters but not as well against the Gnat, which was nicknamed the &quot;Sabre Slayer&quot; by the IAF.

Per India, most of the aircraft losses of the IAF were allegedly on the ground while the PAF suffered most of their losses in aerial combat, a claim that has widely been accepted by most international sources as &quot;a stretch&quot;. The IAF ran a larger offensive air campaign by devoting 40% of its air effort to offensive air support alone.

The two countries have made contradictory claims of combat losses during the war and few neutral sources have verified the claims of either country, as is the case with most India-Pakistan conflicts. The PAF claims that it shot down 104 IAF aircraft and lost 19 of its own, while the IAF claimed it shot down 73 PAF aircraft while losing 60 of its own. According to most independent and neutral sources, the PAF lost some 20 aircraft while the IAF lost somewhere between 60 and 75.

Despite the intense fighting throughout the course of the war, the conflict was effectively a stalemate and inconclusive in its result.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1971===
By late 1971, the intensification of the independence movement in erstwhile East Pakistan led to the Bangladesh Liberation War between West Pakistan and East Pakistan (later joined by India). On 22 November 1971, 10 days before the start of a full-scale war, four PAF F-86 Sabre jets attacked Indian and Mukti Bahini positions at Garibpur, near the international border. Two of the four PAF Sabres were shot down and one damaged by the IAF&#x27;s Gnats. On 3 December, India formally declared war against Pakistan following massive preemptive strikes by the PAF against IAF installations in Srinagar, Ambala, Sirsa, Halwara and Jodhpur. However, the IAF did not suffer any significant losses because the leadership had anticipated such a move and consequently, precautions were taken. The IAF was quick to respond to Pakistani airstrikes, following which the PAF carried out mostly defensive sorties.

Hostilities officially ended at 14:30 GMT on 17 December, after the fall of Dacca on 15 December. The PAF flew about 2,840 sorties and destroyed 71 IAF aircraft while losing 43 of its own.

===1979–1989: Soviet–Afghan War===
In 1979, the PAF&#x27;s Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Anwar Shamim, was told by then-President and Chief of the Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq, that Pakistan had reliable intelligence on Indian plans to attack and destroy Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear research facilities in Kahuta. ACM Shamim told General Zia-ul-Haq that, in the PAF&#x27;s current state, &quot;Indian aircraft could reach the area in three minutes whereas the PAF would take eight minutes, allowing the Indians to attack the facility and return before the PAF could defend or retaliate&quot;. Because Kahuta was close to the Indian border, a consensus was reached acknowledging that the best way to deter a possible Indian attack would be to procure new advanced fighters and weaponry. These could be used to mount a retaliatory attack on India&#x27;s nuclear research facilities in Trombay in the event of an Indian attack on Kahuta. It was decided the most suitable aircraft would be the F-16 Fighting Falcon, which the United States eventually agreed to supply after the PAF refused to purchase the F-5. In 1983, when the first batch of F-16s reached Pakistan, ACM Shamim informed Zia of the PAF&#x27;s increasing capability to effectively respond to an attack on the nuclear research facilities at Kahuta.

Due to rising tensions with the Soviet Union due to its invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan&#x27;s ISI systematically coordinated with the CIA, MI6 and Mossad to secure American resources and armaments for the Afghan mujahideen who were combating the invading Soviet forces. Various reports during this period widely indicated that the PAF had in fact covertly engaged in aerial combat against the Soviet Air Force in support of the Afghan Air Force during the course of the conflict; one of which belonged to Alexander Rutskoy.

A letter of agreement for up to 28 F-16A and 12 F-16B was signed in December 1981. The contracts, &quot;Peace Gate I&quot; and &quot;Peace Gate II&quot; were for 6 and 34 Block 15 models respectively, which would be powered by the F100-PW-200 engine. The first &quot;Peace Gate I&quot; aircraft was accepted at Fort Worth in October 1982. Two F-16A and four F-16B were subsequently delivered to Pakistan in 1983, with the first F-16 arriving at PAF Base Sargodha (now known as PAF Base Mushaf) on 15 January 1983 flown by Squadron Leader Shahid Javed. The 34 remaining aircraft as part of &quot;Peace Gate II&quot; were delivered between 1983 and 1987.

Between May 1986 and November 1988, the PAF&#x27;s newly acquired F-16s had shot down at least eight intruding aircraft from Afghanistan. The first three of these (one Su-22, one probable Su-22, and one An-26) were shot down by two pilots from No. 9 Squadron. Pilots of No. 14 Squadron destroyed the remaining five intruders (two Su-22s, two MiG-23s, and one Su-25). Most of these kills were by the AIM-9 Sidewinder, but at least one (a Su-22) was destroyed by cannon fire. Pakistani Flight Lieutenant Khalid Mahmoud is credited with three of these kills.

The PAF is believed to have evaluated the French Dassault Mirage 2000 in early 1981 and was planning to evaluate the F-16 Fighting Falcon afterwards.

===1990–2001: U.S. arms embargo===
After the Pressler amendment was passed, the United States placed sanctions and an arms embargo on Pakistan starting on 6 October 1990 due to the continuance of the country&#x27;s nuclear weapons research programme. All eleven &quot;Peace Gate III&quot; F-16s, along with seven F-16A and ten F-16B of the 60 &quot;Peace Gate IV&quot; F-16s, which had been built by the end of 1994 were embargoed and put into storage on U.S. soil.

Desperate for a new high-tech combat aircraft, between late 1990 and 1993 the PAF evaluated the European Panavia Tornado MRCA (multi-role combat aircraft), and ultimately rejected it. France&#x27;s Dassault Mirage 2000E and an offer from Poland for the supply of MiG-29s and Su-27s were also considered, but no deal materialized. In 1992, the PAF once again looked towards the French Mirage 2000, reviving a proposal from the early 1980s to procure around 20–40 aircraft, but a sale did not occur because France did not want to sell a fully capable version due to pressure from the United States. In August 1994, the PAF was offered the Saab JAS-39 Gripen by Sweden, but the sale did not occur because 20% of the Gripen&#x27;s components were sourced from the U.S., which was still maintaining sanctions on Pakistan.

In mid-1992, Pakistan was close to signing a contract for the supply of 40 Dassault Mirage 2000s, equipped with Thomson-CSF RDM/7 radars from France, although U.S. sanctions also prevented this deal from finalizing.

In mid-1994, it was reported that Russian manufacturers Sukhoi and Mikoyan were offering the Su-27 and MiG-29, but Pakistan was reported to be negotiating for supply of the Mirage 2000–5. French and Russian teams visited Pakistan on 27 November 1994 and it was speculated that the interest in Russian aircraft was to pressure France into reducing the price of the Mirage 2000. The stated requirement was for up to 40 aircraft.

===2001–2021: War in Afghanistan===
The Pakistan Air Force is believed to have had a primary role in the alleged evacuation of Taliban personnel by the Pakistani military from Afghanistan. However, Pakistani and American officials have denied any such airlift taking place.

===2008 post-Mumbai attacks air alert===

After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Pakistan Air Force was put on high alert in anticipation of any potential Indian accusations and offensives. It deployed to all its wartime locations and started routine combat air patrols. The speed and intensity of the deployment and PAF&#x27;s readiness took the Indian Army High Command by surprise and later reports suggest that was the main factor to influence the Indians&#x27; decision of not going for cross border raids inside Pakistan. The PAF was issued a standing order to launch an immediate counter-attack in case of an air attack from India, after a call from the Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee to the Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari (the call later turned out to be a hoax).

===2011 U.S. raid in Abbottabad===

An initial investigation report revealed that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) reported the movement of some half-a-dozen planes near the Jalalabad border at 23:00 before American helicopters entered Abbottabad to kill Osama bin Laden. &quot;One aircraft was identified as a US AWACS and the remaining five were recognized as F/A-18 jets of the US. These planes flew near the Pakistani border, but did not cross into the airspace of Pakistan,&quot;

On the detection of an intrusion, PAF jets on air defence alert were scrambled and the PAF immediately took adequate operational measures as per standard operating procedure. The PAF aircraft continued their presence in the Abbottabad area until early morning and later returned to their air bases.

However, the fact that so many non-stealth aircraft had entered Pakistani airspace, stayed for three hours to carry out a major operation, and that PAF jets only arrived at the location 24 minutes after the American helicopters had left made a senior PAF official term it &quot;one of the most embarrassing incidents in Pakistan&#x27;s history&quot;.

===2001–2021: Counter-insurgency operations in North-West Pakistan===
The Pakistan Army faced several problems during its 2009 offensive against the Taliban in North-West Pakistan. Hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis vacated the area when the offensive was announced and, eventually, over two million had to be accommodated in refugee camps. The offensive was to be completed as quickly as possible to allow the refugees to return to their homes but the army&#x27;s fleet attack helicopters were insufficient to provide adequate support to infantry on the ground. The PAF was sent into action against the Taliban to make up for the lack of helicopter gunships. Because the PAF was trained and equipped to fight a conventional war, a new &quot;counter-terrorist doctrine&quot; had to be improvised.

The PAF&#x27;s &quot;Saffron Bandit&quot; exercise focused on extensive training of combat personnel to undertake COIN operations. New equipment was inducted to improve the PAF&#x27;s joint intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. A C-130 transport aircraft was indigenously modified for day/night ISR operations.

Use of laser-guided bombs was increased to 80% of munitions used, as compared to 40% in the previous 1960s Bajaur campaign. A small corps of ground spotters were trained and used by the PAF, in addition to Pakistan Army spotters, to identify high-value targets.

Prior to the Pakistan Army&#x27;s offensive into South Waziristan, the PAF attacked militant infrastructure with 500 lb and 2000 lb bombs.

A number of civilian casualties occurred during PAF airstrikes on 10 April 2010 in the FATA tribal region. According to sources from the Pakistani military, the first bombing was targeted at a gathering of militants in a compound. Locals who had quickly moved onto the scene of the first airstrike to recover the dead and wounded were then killed by a second airstrike. While there is no confirmed death toll, it is widely believed that at least 30 civilian deaths had occurred according to the military approximations, whereas a local official stated that at least 73 locals, including women and children, were killed. A six-member committee of tribal elders from the area tasked with finding the exact number of civilian casualties reported that 61 civilians were killed and 21 were wounded. This was not confirmed by government figures but Pakistan&#x27;s then-Chief of the Army Staff, General Ashfaq Kayani, gave a public apology on 17 April. It is reported that BBC News and several other media correspondences were not allowed to take interviews from the injured.

===2019 Pakistan airstrikes in Jammu and Kashmir===


Following the Pulwama attack in Jammu and Kashmir, India accused involvement of Pakistani hands in this incident. In response, India carried out airstrikes in the vicinity of the town of Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, several miles inside the province&#x27;s boundary with Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan&#x27;s military claimed that the Indian planes dropped their payload in an uninhabited wooded hilltop area near Balakot after being intercepted by PAF fighter jets.

On 27 February 2019, when a standoff between India and Pakistan had begun, Pakistan claimed to have struck six targets near Indian military installations inside Indian Controlled Kashmir, which hit open spaces through a codenamed &quot;Operation Swift Retort&quot;.

Indian Air Force jets were scrambled to intercept the PAF jets inside Jammu and Kashmir. Following the interception, a fierce dogfight ensued and Pakistani aircraft shot down an Indian MiG-21.

Ten minutes before the 27 February airstrikes, an IAF Mi-17 helicopter was shot down by an Indian Spyder missile, having been mistaken for a PAF drone. This resulted in total loss of the aircraft and death of all on board: two pilots (squadron leaders Siddarth Vashista and Ninad Mandavgane), flight engineer Vishal Kumar Pandey, sergeant Vikrant Sehrawat, and corporals Deepak Pandey and Pankaj Kumars, and one civilian on the ground (Kifayat Hussain Gani). In April 2023 IAF court martialled Group Captain Sumon Roy Chaudhry, second in command of Srinagar Air Force Station at the time of the PAF strikes for negligence, and he was to be dismissed, however the dismissal was ruled &quot;ultra vires&quot; by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, who set a date of 12 September 2023 for their hearing The pilots were posthumously awarded the Vayu Sena gallantry medal.

India stated that it had only lost a single aircraft (a MiG-21) while claiming to have shot down a Pakistani F-16. Pakistan rejected India&#x27;s statement, stating that no F-16s were deployed. India also accepted loss of its Mi-17 helicopter in a friendly fire terming it as &quot;a big mistake&quot;. Pakistan would later go on to accept that F-16s had been used, but maintained that none of them were shot down. Pakistan also claimed to have shot down a Sukhoi Su-30 MKI, a claim rejected by Indian authorities. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was piloting the MiG-21 Bison, was captured and arrested by the Pakistani military upon being shot down. He was held for two days before being released at the Wagah-Attari border crossing on 1 March.

Initially, Pakistani military officials claimed to have had two pilots in custody, one of whom died while undergoing treatment, a claim which was later changed to having only Abhinandan in custody. This was taken to be evidence of a Pakistani pilot being shot down by some Indian sources. US count of PAF&#x27;s F-16 fleet and various international military observers, refused to buy Indian claim of shooting down PAF&#x27;s F-16.

===2022 Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan===
At least 47 people were killed and 22 injured in two airstrikes by Pakistani forces along the border with Afghanistan on 16 April 2022. The Taliban summoned Pakistan&#x27;s ambassador in Kabul and registered their protest against the military airstrikes inside Afghanistan. These airstrikes mark the first known instance of a foreign country launching attack on Afghan soil since the establishment of Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan.

===2024 Pakistani airstrikes in Iran===

At least 9 people were killed when Pakistan Air Force conducted retaliatory strikes, codenamed as Operation Marg Bar Sarmachar on seven targets within Iranian Sistan-Balochistan province. The attack came two days after a similar Iranian missile strike inside Pakistani territory. According to Iran, nine foreign nationals were killed in the attack. Baloch Liberation Army, one of the group targeted in the strikes, said that the strikes had targeted and killed its people. It was first strike on Iranian soil by any foreign power since the time of end of Iran–Iraq War in 1988.

===March 2024 Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan===

On 18 March 2024, in response to the attack from Afghanistan, Pakistan Air Force carried out two intelligence based airstrikes on Afghanistan&#x27;s eastern border provinces of Khost and Paktika. The Afghan government claim that Pakistan killed five women and three children. Pakistan denies this, claiming that it killed terrorists instead while targeting the Hafiz Gul Bahadur militant group, a splinter organization of the Pakistani Taliban, and that it had successfully killed Sehra alias Janan, a high-value target (HVT) commander. Another commander, Abdullah Mehsud, was claimed to have been killed, but later released a video refuting the claim. It was also reported that Mehsud&#x27;s house was targeted in which his wife and a minor son was killed. Pakistan went on to blame the Pakistani Taliban and its splinter militias for the deaths of hundreds of Pakistani civilians, and claimed that they used Afghanistan as a base and that they had support from within the Taliban. These airstrikes mark the second instance of attack by Pakistan on the sovereign soil of Afghanistan in a period less than two years. The first similar Pakistani airstrikes on Afghan soil came in 2022.

=== December 2024 Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan ===

On 25 December 2024, the Pakistan Air Force launched precision airstrikes located across seven villages of Barmal District of Afghanistan Paktika province killing 20-25 terrorists. Afghan Taliban claim that Pakistani strikes had killed 46 people, including women and children, while Pakistan denies this claim and maintains terrorist camps operated by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan(TTP) were gutted. The villages targeted by PAF included Laman, Margha, and Murg Bazaar and four other villages of Barmal district. Reports indicate that the Murg Bazaar village in Barmal was completely destroyed. According to Pakistani sources, the Pakistani airstrikes took four High Value Targets (HVTs) that included terrorists camps and hideouts of key commanders of TTP. The targets included the compound of senior ranking Commander of TTP Sher Zaman alias Mukhlis Yar&#x27;s hideout, the Commander Abu Hamza&#x27;s recruitment camp and Akhtar Muhammad alias Khalil&#x27;s suicide bomber camp. All of these commanders were using camps for recruitment and training young child suicide bombers and terrorists. The fourth target struck by PAF was &quot;Umar Media&quot; cell of TTP, being headed by the TTP&#x27;s commander Shoaib Iqbal Cheema alias Muneeb Jatt, from where the TTP propagated its digital propaganda to recruit suicide bombers. Afghan Taliban&#x27;s Defence Ministry and the Afghan Taliban regime official spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed reports of the strike carried out by Pakis­tani forces, but claimed that the dead and injured included a number of children and other civilians. The PAF&#x27;s strikes mark third instance of Pakistan launching attack on Afghan soil since the fall of Kabul. The Pakistan airstrikes coincided the birthday of Pakistan&#x27;s founder and followed the PAF&#x27;s 2022 Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan and 2024 Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan.

===Special forces===

The Pakistan Air Force&#x27;s Special Services Wing (SSW) is the branch&#x27;s elite special operations fighting force. Originally coming into existence following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the SSW is heavily modelled off of the United States Air Force&#x27;s Special Tactics Squadrons with some elements inspired by the United States Army Rangers. The unit remained active but saw little prioritization by the Pakistani military until after the Kargil War. In late 1999, the SSW was largely revived and restructured for active service and is currently fielding around 1,200 troops.

===Women in the Pakistan Air Force===
===Religious minorities in the Pakistan Air Force===
Since its inception, religious minorities have been free to pursue careers within the Pakistan Armed Forces, with the exception of Hindus until 2001. Following its involvement in the global U.S.-led War on Terror, Pakistan released the Hindu minority in the country from the discriminatory law and granted them the same freedoms that were already present for their Christian, Sikh and other various counterparts. Some notable religious minority figures in the Pakistan Air Force include: Air Vice Marshal Eric Gordon Hall, a Christian who served as the Base Commander of Chaklala Air Base during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Air Commodore Nazir Latif and Group Captain Cecil Chaudhry (both Christians) fought in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and later helped establish the Combat Commanders School (CCS). Wing Commander Melvin Leslie Middlecoat was the Commanding Officer of No. 9 Squadron during the 1965 war, he and Squadron Leader Peter Christy fought and were KIA in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. Patrick Desmond Callaghan was another Christian officer who rose to the rank of Air Vice Marshal. Wing Commander Ronald Felix has been a notable Christian pilot known for being the first to fly the jointly-built Chinese and Pakistani JF-17 Thunder fighter jet since 2010 and was one of two PAF pilots flying the JF-17 at the 2011 Izmir Air Show in Turkey.

In 2020, the Pakistan Air Force recruited Rahul Dev, a Hindu from Tharparkar, Sindh in a major breakthrough for the Hindu minority from this remote distant area of Sindh. He was commissioned as a general duty pilot officer on 6 May 2020.

==Equipment==


===Combat aircraft===

* Chengdu J-10C: The J-10C is a multirole combat aircraft. The PAF have ordered at least 25 aircraft on June 25, 2021, with the number is expected to rise to at least 36. In March 2022, the initial batches of J-10s began to arrive in Pakistan, with at least 12 aircraft in operation in September 2022.
* PAC/CAC JF-17 Thunder: A multirole combat aircraft produced by Pakistan with Chinese assistance, the JF-17 was developed to replace Pakistan&#x27;s aging fleets of A-5C, F-7P/PG, Mirage III, and Mirage 5 aircraft. Currently, 149 JF-17s are in active service with the PAF, comprising 47 JF-17A Block 1, 62 JF-17A Block 2, and 25 JF-17B Block 2 variants. A further 50 aircraft of the Block III model, incorporating advanced avionics systems and a new AESA radar, are expected to be produced. In addition the PAF is also expected to order 26 of the two-seat JF-17B variant. The JF-17 is set to become the &quot;backbone&quot; of the PAF alongside its fleet of American F-16s.
* General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon: The F-16 Fighting Falcon currently serves as the primary air fighter of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in addition to its ground attack capabilities. The PAF currently has ≈75 F-16s in active service, comprising 44 F-16AM/BM Block 15 MLU, 13 F-16A/B ADF and 18 F-16C/D Block 52+ variants.
* Dassault Mirage III: Having been in service since 1967, the Mirage III, together with the Mirage 5, serves as the primary strike aircraft of the PAF. The PAF operates more than 80 Mirage III aircraft, comprising multiple variants including the Mirage IIIEP, IIIEL and IIIO fighter-bomber variants, the latter of which have been upgraded under Project ROSE, the Mirage IIIRP reconnaissance variant and the Mirage IIIBE, IIID, IIIDL and IIIDP training variants, the latter of which have also been upgraded under Project ROSE.
* Dassault Mirage 5: The Mirage 5, together with the Mirage III, serves as the PAF&#x27;s primary strike aircraft. The PAF operates around 90 Mirage 5 aircraft of multiple variants, including Mirage 5PA, PA2, PA3 and 5F ground attack aircraft, the latter of which have been upgraded under Project ROSE, the Mirage 5DR reconnaissance variant and the Mirage 5DD and DPA2 training variants.
* Chengdu F-7PG: The Chengdu F-7 serves primarily as an interceptor, and around 140 aircraft are in service. The PAF has phased out its F-7P aircraft from active service, replaced by the JF-17 Thunder. The F-7PG variant remains the primary variant to remain in service with the PAF, while the two seat FT-7PG variant is in use as operational conversion trainer.

===Special mission aircraft===

* Saab 2000: The PAF has been operating the Saab 2000 using the Erieye radar as its primary AEW&amp;C platform since 2009. Out of the original four Saab 2000 in service, one was destroyed and two were damaged in a Taliban attack on PAF Base Minhas in August 2012. The damaged aircraft were subsequently repaired and put back into service. The PAF had ordered three more Erieye AEW&amp;C aircraft from Saab with the first batch having been delivered in 2017.
* Shaanxi Y-8: Four ZDK-03 variants, locally designated the Karakoram Eagle, are in service. They incorporate a Chinese AESA radar mounted on a Y-8F-600 airframe.
* Dassault Falcon 20: The PAF operates three modified Dassault Falcon 20 aircraft with a primary role in electronic warfare.

===Transport aircraft===

* Lockheed C-130 Hercules: The C-130 Hercules has served as the backbone of the PAF&#x27;s transport fleet since its induction in 1962. 15 aircraft, five C-130Bs, nine C-130Es and one L-100, are currently in service. PAF C-130s have been upgraded with Allison T56-A-15 turboprops and extended fatigue lives.
* Harbin Y-12: Three Harbin Y-12 are operated as light utility aircraft by the PAF.
* Gulfsteam IV: The PAF currently operates two Gulfstream IV-SP variants.
* Embraer Phenom 100: Approximately four of these aircraft are in service with the PAF for transportation purposes.
* Cessna Citation Excel: Currently, only one of these aircraft are used by the PAF. Ilyushin Il-78: The PAF operates four Il-78MPs. The Il-78 can also be used as an aerial refuelling tankers by adding refuel tanks in the cargo hold.

===Aerial refuelling aircraft===

* Ilyushin Il-78: The PAF operates four Il-78MPs equipped with UPAZ refuelling pods, procured from Ukraine, as aerial refuelling tankers. The Il-78 can also be used as a general transporter by removing the refuel tanks from the cargo hold.

===Trainer aircraft===

* PAC MFI-17 Mushshak: The Mushshak serves as the PAF&#x27;s basic trainer. The PAF operates 120 Mushshak aircraft, including the improved Super Mushshak variant.
* Cessna T-37 Tweet: The PAF has operated the T-37 as a basic jet trainer since 1962, and these have been supplemented over the years with additional aircraft from Turkey and the United States.
* Hongdu JL-8: The K-8 is operated as an intermediate trainer, before cadets move on to conversion trainers. The K-8 is also operated by the PAF&#x27;s aerobatics display team, the &quot;Sherdils&quot;.

===Helicopters===

* AgustaWestland AW139: Beginning in 2018, the PAF started inducting the AW139 to replace the venerable Alouette. The first AW139 unit became operational in March of that same year.
* Mil Mi-17: The PAF also operates the Mi-171, which serves primarily in CSAR roles.

===Air defence systems===

* MBDA Spada 2000 – A medium altitude air defence system consisting of a radar with a range of 60 kilometres and four 6-cell missile launchers that can intercept enemy missiles and aircraft at a range of over 20 kilometres. A contract for ten batteries was signed when Aspide was selected over competing systems from Raytheon, Diehl BGT and Saab AB after pre-contract firing tests in Pakistan with assistance from the Italian Air Force. Reports state that Pakistan tested the air defence system in July 2010, following deliveries of the first few batteries. Deliveries of all ten batteries are reported to have been completed in 2013 with further orders possible upon immediate request. The missile system was tested by the Range &amp; Instrumentation Division of SUPARCO in synergy with the PAF. Three drones were successfully intercepted and shot down by the missile system following extensive testing.
* Crotale – With the procurement of the Spada 2000, Pakistan reportedly decommissioned most of its Crotale short-range air defence missile systems. However some modernized variants still remain in active service.
* HQ-9B – In October 2003, it was reported that China had closed a deal with Pakistan to supply an unspecified number of FT-2000 systems, an anti-radiation variant of the HQ-9 long-range air defence system. However, in March 2009, a report was published stating that Pakistan was not considering importing the missile. It was reported in mid-2008 that Pakistan intended to purchase a high altitude air-missile defence system and the FD-2000, another variant of HQ-9, was expected to be chosen. In 2023 PAF inducted the HQ-9B variant into service with a reported range of 260 km.
* AML HE 60-20 – A modified version of the French Panhard armoured vehicle equipped with a 20mm anti-aircraft cannon used primarily for on-base security. At least five were originally in service in the late 1990s.

===Drone technology===
On 7 September 2015, Pakistan became the fifth nation globally to develop and use an armed unmanned combat aerial vehicle (drone), the NESCOM Burraq. Pakistan first started exploring drone technology when it acquired Falco drones from Selex Galileo for approximately $40 million in 2008. Since then, Pakistan has been developing variants of the original Falco drone in the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) in collaboration with the Italian firm. The Burraq was developed which was based on the Falco&#x27;s technology. By March 2015, Pakistan was able to test-fire Burraq armed with an air-to-surface missile named Barq with pin-point precision. Burraq drones were used extensively to provide support to the Pakistan Army during Operation Zarb-e-Azb.

Pakistan has already talked with Turkey to manufacture parts for Anka UAV and possibly to produce the combat drones locally. Also the CAIG Wing Loong II UCAVs will be produced in Pakistan with joint collaboration with China.

==Modernisation and acquisitions==
For a brief period, the Pakistan Air Force experienced a stall in modernization efforts, however this ended in April 2006 when the Pakistani cabinet approved the PAF&#x27;s proposals to procure new aircraft and systems from several sources, including modern combat aircraft from the United States and China. The AFFDP 2019 (Armed Forces Development Programme 2019) would oversee the extensive modernization of the PAF from 2006 to 2019.

On 24 July 2008, the Bush administration informed the U.S. Congress that it planned to shift nearly $230 million of $300 million in aid from counter-terrorism programs to upgrading Pakistan&#x27;s ageing F-16s. The administration had previously announced on 27 June 2008 that it was proposing to sell ITT Corporation&#x27;s electronic warfare gear valued at up to $75 million to enhance Pakistan&#x27;s existing inventory of F-16s. Pakistan has asked about buying as many as 21 AN/ALQ-211(V)9 Advanced Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suite Pods (AIDEWS) as well as other related equipment. The proposed sale will ensure that the existing fleet is &quot;compatible&quot; with new F-16 Block 50/52 fighters being purchased by Islamabad.

After 9/11, the U.S. and Pakistan began discussing the release of the embargoed F-16s and Pakistan&#x27;s ability to purchase new aircraft. Of the 28 F-16A/B built under the &quot;Peace Gate III/IV&quot; contracts and embargoed in 1990, 14 were delivered as EDA (Excess Defense Articles) from 2005 to 2008, two of which were delivered on 10 July 2007.

Between 2005 and 2008, 14 F-16A/B Block 15 OCU fighters were delivered to the PAF under renewed post-9/11 ties between the U.S. and Pakistan. These had originally been built for Pakistan under the Peace Gate III/IV contracts but were never delivered due to the subsequent U.S. arms embargo imposed on Pakistan in 1990.

To upgrade the F-16A/B fleet, 32 Falcon STAR kits were purchased for the original &quot;Peace Gate I&quot; aircraft and 35 Mid-Life Update (MLU) kits were ordered, with 11 more MLU kits optional. Four F-16A/B being upgraded in the U.S. to F-16AM/BM had an expected delivery date of December 2011. F-16A/B in the PAF&#x27;s service were to be upgraded starting in October 2010 by Turkish Aerospace Industries, at a rate of one per month.

The &quot;Peace Drive I&quot; contract for 12 F-16C and six F-16D Block 52+ (Advanced Block 52) aircraft, powered by F100-PW-229 engines was signed on 30 September 2006. The first F-16 to be completed, an F-16D, was rolled out on 13 October 2009 and began flight testing immediately. The first batch of F-16C/D Block 52+, two F-16D and one F-16C landed at PAF Base Shahbaz, Jacobabad, on 26 June 2010. One more F-16C was received by 5 July 2010.

On 13 December 2008, the Government of Pakistan stated that two Indian Air Force aircraft were intercepted by the Pakistan Air Force a few kilometers inside Pakistani airspace. This charge is denied by the Indian government.

During talks with a delegation from the French Senate on 28 September 2009, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani stated that the PAF had used most of its stockpile of laser-guided munitions against militants in the Malakand and FATA regions and that replacements for such types of equipment were urgently required.

In December 2009, Pakistan saw the delivery of the PAF&#x27;s first Saab 2000 Erieye AEW&amp;C from Sweden and an Il-78MP aerial refueling tanker/military transport aircraft from Ukraine.

The PAF was reported to be considering purchasing the Chinese Hongdu L-15 advanced jet trainer to train pilots for high-tech fighters such as the Chengdu J-10. Extensive evaluations of the aircraft took place in Pakistan in December 2009.

According to Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Rao Qamar Suleman (then Chief of the Air Staff), the new fighters would eliminate the PAF&#x27;s limitations in conducting precision night-time strike operations, as the existing capability was based on around 34 Dassault Mirage 5 fighters upgraded with new avionics for night-time precision strike missions under the Retrofit of Strike Element (ROSE) programme during 1999–2004. The SABIR (Special Airborne Mission Installation &amp; Response System), a FLIR system that has Brite Star II and Star Safire III EO/IR sensors installed on a C-130 saw extensive usage during the Pakistani military&#x27;s operations against militants in the FATA region.

In 2021, Pakistan agreed to buy 36 Chengdu J-10CP multirole fighter aircraft from China to counter the Dassault Rafale which India bought from France.

On March 11, 2022, PAF inducted modern J-10C fighter aircraft in its fleet, the formal ceremony was conducted at the Minhas Airbase Kamra.

At a ceremony in January 2024, Pakistan announced its intent to acquire the J-35 aircraft.

===Planned acquisitions===
Mass production of the PAC JF-17 Thunder A Block-3, a 4.5 generation aircraft, is underway to replace the F-16 as the &quot;backbone&quot; of the Pakistan Air Force&#x27;s arsenal. After every 3–5 years, newer blocks of the aircraft are expected to be produced. Pakistan has been in extensive talks with China to acquire between 40 and 60 upgraded fifth-generation Shenyang J-35 stealth fighter aircraft. The TAI TF Kaan, another fifth-generation aircraft under development by Turkey (intended to operate with critical assets such as the American F-35 Lightning II) has also been a viable offer for Pakistan, as these fighters can greatly strengthen the PAF&#x27;s fleet before the country&#x27;s own fifth-generation fighter is developed under Project Azm. Pakistan is also reportedly working on developing a strong arsenal of UAVs alongside China&#x27;s CAIG GJ-2 MALE-UCAV.

====Project Azm====

On 7 July 2017, the Pakistan Air Force announced the development of a fifth-generation fighter aircraft, a medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle (MALE UAV) and munitions under the banner of Project &quot;Azm&quot; (Urdu for resolve/determination). Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Sohail Aman stated that the design phase for the MALE UAV was in its final stages.

==Military exercises==
The Pakistan Air Force sent a contingent of six F-16 A/B fighters to the 2004 international Anatolian Eagle exercise in Turkey.
In 2005, after around one year of planning, the PAF held the High Mark 2005 military exercise which lasted for one month and also involved the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Navy. The scenario saw two opposing forces, Blueland and Foxland, engaging in simulated combat which involved both offensive and defensive operations. It was stated that the exercise would consist of three stages and PAF aircraft would fly around 8200 sorties. The involvement of units from the Pakistan Army and Navy was aimed at providing more realistic operational scenarios. High Mark 2005 followed the Tempest-1 military exercise which was focused purely on air power but differed in terms of the duration, intensity and complexity of all air operations being conducted.

In 2008, the Turkish Air Force sent five F-16C/D fighters and 50 personnel from 191 &quot;Cobras&quot; Squadron to Pakistan to take part in the joint Indus Viper exercise at PAF Base Mushaf.

In the summer of 2005, a PAF team of 20 airmen, including pilots, navigators, engineers, maintenance technicians and a C-130E was sent to the United States to take part in the AMC (Air Mobility Command) Rodeo. The PAF again took part in the AMC Rodeo two years later, in July 2007.

In 2009, while undertaking combat operations against militants in the FATA and Swat regions, the PAF initiated the Saffron Bandit exercise with the aim of training the PAF&#x27;s entire combat force to undertake such anti-terrorist operations.

In December 2009, the PAF sent six Chengdu F-7PG fighters of No. 31 Wing based at PAF Base Samungli to the United Arab Emirates to take part in the Air Tactics Leadership Course (ATLC)—also known as Exercise Iron Falcon—at Al Dhafra Air Base.

The PAF&#x27;s High Mark 2010 exercise was launched on 15 March 2010, the first time a High Mark exercise had been conducted since 2005, after all PAF received their Air Tasking Orders (ATO). The country-wide exercise involved units based all over Pakistan, from Skardu to the Arabian Sea, at all Main Operating Bases and Forward Operating Bases. Joint operations involving the Pakistan Army and Pakistan Navy were also conducted, aiming to test and improve integration and co-operation between the three branches of the Pakistan Armed Forces. Operations emphasized a near-realistic simulation of a wartime environment, exposure of PAF aircrews to contemporary concepts of air combat, new employment concepts and joint operations between the Pakistan Air Force, Army and Navy. New inductions such as the JF-17 Thunder, Saab 2000 Erieye AEW&amp;C and Il-78 MRTT also saw service in this exercise. On 6 April 2010, the end of the first phase of exercise High Mark 2010 was celebrated with a 90-minute firepower demonstration at the PAF&#x27;s firing range facility in the deserts of Thal. The H-2 SOW was also shown to the public for the first time, being launched from around 60 km away before hitting its target, and a mock counter-insurgency operation was performed by participating forces. The demo heralded the beginning of High Mark 2010&#x27;s second phase, where the PAF would practice joint operations with the Pakistan Army during its own exercise &quot;Azm-e-Nau-3&quot; (New Resolve 3). During High Mark 2010, a Chengdu F-7 and Mirage 5 fighter practiced landing, refueling and take-off operations from a motorway. It was reported that the PAF is in negotiations with the Ministry of Communications to set up any required facilities for PAF operations on various motorways in Pakistan.

In July 2010, the PAF sent six F-16B fighters of No. 9 &quot;Griffins&quot; Squadron and 100 PAF personnel to Nellis Air Force Base in the U.S. to participate in the international Red Flag exercise for the first time. During the exercise, the PAF pilots practiced in-flight refuelling with their F-16s using the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker.

In October 2010, the PAF&#x27;s No. 7 &quot;Bandits&quot; Squadron sent a team of its Dassault Mirage III ROSE fighters to Jordan to participate in the Falcon Air Meet 2010 exercise at the Azraq Royal Jordanian Air Base. January 2011 saw a PAF contingent of F-16A/B and Dassault Mirage fighters take part in the Al-Saqoor II exercise in Saudi Arabia with the Royal Saudi Air Force.

In March 2011, a joint Sino-Pakistani exercise, codenamed &quot;Shaheen-1&quot;, was conducted involving a contingent of Chinese aircraft and personnel from the PLAAF. Information on which aircraft were used by each side in the exercise remained classified, but photos of Pakistani pilots inspecting what appeared to be Chinese Shenyang J-11B fighters were released on the internet. The exercise lasted for around four weeks and was the first time the PLAAF had deployed to Pakistan and conducted &quot;operational&quot; aerial maneuvers with the PAF.

==Involvement in Pakistani society==
The Pakistan Air Force, alongside other branches of the armed forces has played an integral part in the civil society of Pakistan since its inception. In 1996, General Jehangir Karamat described the Pakistani military&#x27;s relations with Pakistan&#x27;s populace:

In times of natural disaster such as the chaotic floods of 1992 or the October 2005 earthquake, PAF engineers, medical and logistics personnel alongside the rest of the armed forces played a major role in bringing relief aid and supplies to those who were affected.

In addition to the PAF&#x27;s involvement in relief activities at home, it has also helped the Pakistani military&#x27;s responses to natural disasters in many other countries globally. The PAF was involved in the dispatching of relief to Indonesia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after they were hit by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Coordinating a synergized response, the Pakistan Armed Forces sent ships and helicopters with aid and personnel to assist in the international relief operation.

==In popular culture==
In Pakistani literature, the shaheen falcon has a special association with the poetry of the country&#x27;s national poet, Allama Muhammad Iqbal. The bird also appears on the official representative badge of the Pakistan Air Force.

Various Urdu-language drama serials on the PAF have been written, produced, directed, and televised nationwide. Notable Urdu drama serials and films involving the PAF are &quot;Shahpar&quot; and &quot;Sherdil&quot;, which were televised on PTV and ARY Digital, respectively.

==Notable personnel==
The Nishan-e-Haider (), is the highest military award of Pakistan, and is roughly equivalent in value to the United States&#x27; Medal of Honor. Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas (1951 – 20 August 1971) is the only officer of the PAF to have been awarded the Nishan-e-Haider for sacrificing his life to save an aircraft from being hijacked to India.

Other notable recipients of major military awards include:

*Air Commodore Muhammad Mahmood Alam – awarded for downing nine fighters (of which five were downed within one minute) of the Indian Air Force in direct air-to-air combat. (Sitara-e-Jurat)
*Air Commodore Najeeb Ahmed Khan – B-57 Canberra bomber pilot who raided the Adampur Airbase several times during the 1965 war. (Sitara-e-Jurat)
*Squadron Leader Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafiqui – awarded for refusing to abandon his group of fighters during a battle despite his guns being jammed. He continued his attempts to assist his squadron in the battle by chasing enemy fighters until eventually being shot down. (Hilal-e-Jurat, Sitara-e-Jurat)
*Air Marshall Nur Khan – awarded for personally leading several operational missions that uplifted morale and enabled the air force to assert control over a larger and better-equipped enemy. (Hilal-e-Jurat)

<text>Dorothy Miller Richardson (17 May 1873 – 17 June 1957) was a British author and journalist. Author of &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, a sequence of 13 semi-autobiographical novels published between 1915 and 1967—though Richardson saw them as chapters of one work—she was one of the earliest modernist novelists to use stream of consciousness as a narrative technique. Richardson also emphasises in &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; the importance and distinct nature of female experiences. The title &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; alludes not only to &quot;the journey of the artist ... to self-realisation but, more practically, to the discovery of a unique creative form and expression&quot;.

==Biography==
Richardson was born in Abingdon, Oxfordshire in 1873, the third of four daughters. After the fourth daughter was born her father (Charles) began referring to Dorothy as his son. Richardson &quot;also attributed this habit to her own boylike willfulness&quot;. She lived at &#x27;Whitefield&#x27; a large mansion type house on Albert Park (built by her father in 1871 and now owned by Abingdon School. Her family moved to Worthing, West Sussex in 1880 and then Putney, London in 1883. In London she &quot;attended a progressive school influenced by the ideas of John Ruskin&quot;, and where &quot;the pupils were encouraged to think for themselves&quot;. Here she &quot;studied French, German, literature, logic and psychology&quot;. At seventeen, because of her father&#x27;s financial difficulties she went to work as a governess and teacher, first in 1891 for six months at a finishing school in Hanover, Germany. In 1895 Richardson gave up work as a governess to take care of her severely depressed mother, but her mother committed suicide the same year. Richardson&#x27;s father had become bankrupt at the end of 1893.
Richardson subsequently moved in 1896 to an attic room, 7 Endsleigh Street, Bloomsbury, London, where she worked as a receptionist/secretary/assistant in a Harley Street dental surgery. While in Bloomsbury in the late 1890s and early 1900s, Richardson associated with writers and radicals, including the Bloomsbury Group. In 1904 she took a holiday in the Bernese Oberland, financed by one of the dentists, which was the source for her novel &quot;Oberland&quot;. H. G. Wells (1866–1946) was a friend and they had a brief affair which led to a pregnancy and then miscarriage, in 1907. Wells was married to a former schoolmate of Richardson&#x27;s. On leave from work she stayed in Pevensey, Sussex and went to Switzerland for the winter. Then she resigned from her Harley Street job and left London &quot;to spend the next few years in Sussex ... on a farm run by a Quaker family&quot;. Richardson&#x27;s interest in the Quakers led to her writing &quot;The Quakers Past and Present&quot; and editing an anthology &quot;Gleanings from the Works of George Fox&quot;, which were both published in 1914. She spent much of 1912 in Cornwall, and then in 1913 rented a room in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, though she also lived in Cornwall.

While she had first published an article in 1902, Richardson&#x27;s writing career as a freelance journalist really began around 1906, with periodical articles on various topics, book reviews, short stories, and poems, and as well she translated during her life eight books into English from French and German. The subjects of Richardson&#x27;s book reviews and early essays range &quot;for Whitman and Nietzsche to French philosophy and British politics&quot; demonstrating both &quot;the range of her interests and the sharpness of her mind&quot;. 
Starting in 1908 Richardson regularly wrote short prose essays, &quot;sketches&quot; for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, and around 1912 &quot;a reviewer urged her to try writing a novel&quot;. She began writing &quot;Pointed Roofs&quot;, in the autumn of 1912, while staying with J. D. Beresford and his wife in Cornwall, and it was published in 1915.
She married the artist Alan Odle (1888–1948) in 1917—a distinctly bohemian figure, associated with an artistic circle that included Augustus John, Jacob Epstein, and Wyndham Lewis. He was fifteen years younger than her, tubercular and an alcoholic, and was not expected to live long. However, he stopped drinking and lived until 1948. Odle was very thin and &quot;over six feet tall with waist-length hair wound around the outside of his head&quot;, which he never cut. He also rarely cut his finger nails. From 1917 until 1939, the couple spent their winters in Cornwall and their summers in London; and then stayed permanently in Cornwall until Odle&#x27;s death in 1948. She supported herself and her husband with freelance writing for periodicals for many years, as Alan made little money from his art. Between 1927 and 1933 she published 23 articles on film in the avant-garde little magazine, &quot;Close Up&quot;, with which her close friend Bryher was involved.

In 1954, she had to move into a nursing home in the London suburb of Beckenham, Kent, where she died in 1957. 
The last chapters (books) of &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, published during Richardson&#x27;s lifetime, were &quot;Clear Horizon&quot; in 1935 and &quot;Dimple Hill&quot; with the 1938 Collected Edition. This Collected Edition was poorly received and Richardson only published, during the rest of her life, three chapters of another volume in 1946, as work in &quot;Work in Progress&quot;, in &quot;Life and Letters&quot;.

The final chapter (13th book) of &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, &quot;March Moonlight&quot;, was not published until 1967, where it forms the conclusion to Volume IV of the Collected Edition; though the first three chapters had appeared as &quot;Work in Progress&quot;, &quot;Life and Letters&quot;, 1946. This novel is incomplete. Apparently because of the poor sales and disappointing reception of the Collected Edition of 1938, she lost heart. She was 65 in 1938.

==Stream of consciousness==
In a review of &quot;Pointed Roofs&quot; (&quot;The Egoist&quot; April 1918), May Sinclair first applied the term &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; in her discussion of Richardson&#x27;s stylistic innovations. &quot;Pointed Roofs&quot; was the first volume of &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, the first complete stream of consciousness novel published in English. The term was 
first used by Alexander Bain in 1855 in the first edition of &quot;The Senses and the Intellect&quot;, but is commonly credited to William James who used it in 1890 in his &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot;. In a letter to the bookseller and publisher Sylvia Beach in 1934, Richardson comments that &quot;Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf &amp; D.R. ... were all using &#x27;the new method&#x27;, though very differently, simultaneously&quot;.

Richardson hated the term, calling it in 1949 &quot;that lamentably meaningless metaphor &#x27;The &quot;Shroud&quot; of Consciousness&#x27; borrowed ... by May Sinclair from the epistemologists, ... to describe my work, &amp; still, in Lit. criticism. pushing its inane career&quot;.

==&quot;Pilgrimage&quot;==

Miriam Henderson, the central character in the &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; novel sequence, is based on author&#x27;s own life between 1891 and 1915. Richardson, however, saw &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; as one novel for which each of the individual volumes were &quot;chapters&quot;. &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; was read as a work of fiction and &quot;its critics did not suspect that its content was a reshaping of DMR&#x27;s own experience&quot;, nor that it was a &quot;roman à clef&quot;.

==Feminist writer==
Richardson is also an important feminist writer, because of the way her work assumes the validity and importance of female experiences as a subject for literature. She records that when she began writing, &quot;attempting to produce a feminine equivalent of the current masculine realism&quot;, and after setting aside &quot;a considerable mass of manuscript&quot; finding &quot;a fresh pathway&quot;. Her wariness of the conventions of language, her bending of the normal rules of punctuation, sentence length, and so on, are used to create a feminine prose, which Richardson saw as necessary for the expression of female experience. Virginia Woolf in 1923 noted, that Richardson &quot;has invented, or, if she has not invented, developed and applied to her own uses, a sentence which we might call the psychological sentence of the feminine gender.&quot; In her 1938 &quot;Foreword&quot; to the Collected Edition of &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; Richardson responded to criticism of her writing, &quot;for being unpunctuated and therefore unreadable&quot;, arguing that &quot;Feminine prose, as Charles Dickens and James Joyce show themselves to be aware, should properly be unpunctuated, moving from point to point without formal obstruction&quot;.

John Cowper Powys, writing in 1931, saw Richardson as a &quot;pioneer in a completely new direction&quot; because she has created in her protagonist Miriam the first woman character who embodies the female &quot;quest for the essence of human experience&quot;. Powys contrasts Richardson with other women novelists, such as George Eliot and Virginia Woolf whom he sees as betraying their deepest feminine instincts by using &quot;as their medium of research not these instincts but the rationalistic methods of men&quot;. Likewise in 1975 Sydney Janet Kaplan describes &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; as &quot;conceived in revolt against the established tradition of fiction. ... [Richardson&#x27;s] writing marks a revolution in perspective, a shift from a &#x27;masculine&#x27; to a &#x27;feminine&#x27; method of exposition&quot;.

==London novelist==
After first working as a governess in Germany and then England, early in her life Richardson &quot;lived in a Bloomsbury attic ... [and] London became her great adventure. And although &quot;Pointed Roofs&quot; focuses on Miriam&#x27;s experience as a governess in Germany, much of &quot;Pilgrimage&quot; is set in London. London &quot;is an &#x27;elastic&#x27; material space that facilitates Miriam&#x27;s public life. London&#x27;s streets, cafés, restaurants and clubs figure largely in her explorations, which extend her knowledge of both the city and herself&quot;. John Cowper Powys in his 1931 study of Richardson, describes her as London&#x27;s William Wordsworth, who instead of &quot;the mystery of mountains and lakes&quot; gives us &quot;the mystery of roof-tops and pavements&quot;.

==Reputation==

Rebecca Bowler wrote in August 2015: &quot;Given Richardson&#x27;s importance to the development of the English novel, her subsequent neglect is extraordinary&quot;. The first few of her novels &quot;were received with rapturous enthusiasm and occasional confusion&quot;, but by the 1930s interest had declined—despite John Cowper Powys championing her in his short critical study &quot;Dorothy M. Richardson&quot; (1931). In 1928 Conrad Aiken, in a review of &quot;Oberland&quot; had attempted to explain why she was so &quot;curiously little known,&quot; and offered the following reasons: her &quot;minute recording&quot; which tires those who want action; her choice of a woman&#x27;s mind as centre; and her heroine&#x27;s lack of &quot;charm.&quot; By 1938 &quot;she was sufficiently obscure for Ford Madox Ford to bewail the &#x27;amazing phenomenon&#x27; of her &#x27;complete world neglect.
However, Richardson changed publishers and Dent &amp; Cresset Press published a new Collected Edition of Pilgrimage in 1938. This was republished by Virago Press &quot;in the late 1970s, in its admirable but temporary repopularisation of Richardson&quot;. In 1976 in America, a four volume Popular Library (New York) edition appeared. Now scholars are once again reclaiming her work and the Arts and Humanities Research Council in England is supporting the Dorothy Richardson Scholarly Editions Project, with the aim of publishing a collected edition of Richardson&#x27;s works and letters. &quot;Pointed Roofs&quot; was translated into Japanese in 1934, French in 1965 and German in 1993. There were subsequent French translations of &quot;Backwater&quot;, 1992 and &quot;Deadlock&quot;, 1993.

A blue plaque was unveiled, in May 2015, at Woburn Walk in Bloomsbury, where Richardson lived, in 1905 and 1906, opposite W. B. Yeats, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; comments that &quot;people are starting to read her once more, again reasserting her place in the canon of experimental modernist prose writers&quot;.

<doc id="377435" wikidata="Q2174853" url="?curid=377435" title="1960 Rugby League World Cup">
<text>The 1960 Rugby League World Cup was the third World Cup for men’s national teams and was held between 24 September and 8 October and hosted in England. The same format used in 1957 was used, with Great Britain winning their second World Cup after finishing top of the group.

The 1960 World Cup raised problems which had not really affected the previous tournaments. Live television of complete games was held responsible for lower than anticipated attendances, the largest crowd being the 32,773 which gathered at Odsal for the deciding match between Australia and Great Britain.

For Australia the World Cup matches formed part of their Kangaroo Tour of Great Britain and France.

<text>An electrical lighting technician, or simply lighting technician, are involved with rigging stage and location sets and controlling artificial, electric lights for art and entertainment venues (theatre or live music venues) or in video, television, or film production.

In a theater production, lighting technicians work under the lighting designer and master electrician. In video, television, and film productions, lighting technicians work under the direction of the gaffer or chief lighting technician who takes their direction from the cinematographer. In live music, lighting technicians work under the lighting director. All heads of department report to the production manager.

Lighting technicians are responsible for the movement and set up of various pieces of lighting equipment for separation of light and shadow or contrast, depth of field or visual effects. Lighting Technicians may also lay electrical cables, wire fixtures, install color effects or image patterns, focus the lights, and assist in creating effects or programming sequences.

Some local unions such as the International Alliance of Threatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) Hollywood chapter local #728, have been qualifying members by certification and recognition through the Entertainment Stage Technologies Association (ESTA) with their Entertainment Technicians Certification Program (ETCP). Basic skill sets are now standardized, and sets and stage are safer through this program.

==History==
Officially called the electrical lighting technician, or the rigging electrical lighting technician, the technician is also known as set lighting technician, lamp operator, electrician, electric, spark or juicer.

The lighting technicians on a motion picture set handle all of the electrical needs as well as place and focus all of the lighting under the direction of the gaffer (chief lighting technician). 

Lighting techs also:

* Study the script and consult with director to assess what lighting is required (Gaffer).
* Discuss production requirements with the camera operator (Cinematographer).
* Select lights and equipment to be used and organize any additional equipment (Gaffer).
* Set up, focus and operate light fixtures and equipment.
* Control consoles and auxiliary equipment.
* Choose and combine colors to achieve the desired effect (Cinematographer/Gaffer).
* Operate the lights during the performance.
* Use manual or computer control consoles to control lighting throughout a production.
* Use devices such as barn-doors, scrims and other attachments to control lighted areas.
* Perform routine maintenance functions such as replacing lamps and damaged color filters or patterns and maintain lighting equipment in safe working conditions.
* Explore new techniques and special effects.
* Place and focus lighting fixtures for any given scene to be photographed.
* Distribute power and work lights around the set and support areas (including actor&#x27;s trailers, portable production offices, catering, etc.).
* Management of electrical generators.
* Provide electricity to all support services and departments on the set.

Also, specialty roles are called upon the lighting technician such as:

* Follow spot operator
* Console/dimmer board operator
* Fixtures
* Manual/poor man&#x27;s operator

Hours of work also vary. For example, those employed by large television productions generally work more than 40 hours a week, 60 hours or more are not uncommon. Technicians and other crew members typically work a 12-hour day.

Depending on script requirements, stage and locations bring on their own requirements for lighting and effects. Out of state, or country to get the right look in a script is not uncommon. Location work always brings on its own challenges. Weather is always a factor when going to a location. Technicians are like scouts and have to be prepared for all kinds of weather as per the season.

Working conditions for lighting technicians vary a great deal from one job to another. Lighting technicians generally spend a lot of time on their feet and the pace of work can become hectic. Last-minute changes are often required and safety precautions must be observed when handling hot lamps, climbing ladders or working on high voltage electrical cables and equipment. Lighting technicians are routinely required to lift and carry the heaviest and more dangerous equipment compared to the other departments and office staff.

The film set electrical department hierarchy is as follows: Electrical lighting techs (rigging electrical lighting techs) report to the Best Boy (Assistant Chief Lighting Technician or ACLT) who reports to the Gaffer (Chief Lighting Technician or CLT), who is the head of the department. The Rigging Best Boy (Rigging Assistant Chief Lighting Technician) reports to the Rigging Gaffer (Chief Rigging Technician) who is the head of the rigging, but not the department. Both rigging heads report to the ACLT and CLT of the department. The Gaffer is the Head of the Set Lighting Department and reports to the Director of Photography (Cinematographer) to make decisions on the creative lighting on the set (or on location), and is responsible for executing those decisions. A budget deciphered from the production schedule, script and vision mandates the types of lights and how to proceed with rigs.

In live music performances, concerts, and other entertainment, stage lighting technicians (also called a lighting tech, lighting operator, stage electrician, &quot;sparky&quot;, &quot;lampy&quot;, or &quot;techie&quot;) set up lighting and make effects for live performances, concerts and any other show/production involving lighting. 

Duties include:
* Setting up and focusing lights
* Patching and or wiring up lights to dimmers or electronic control consoles
* Changing the set-up of lights during a performance or concert (e.g., changing color gels)
* Packing down lights after the show

The Stage lighting department hierarchy is as follows:

* Chief lighting Technician: works with the production manager to determine what effects need to be created, creates a plan to achieve the desired effects, and then directs the other members of the stage lighting department to set up the appropriate lighting equipment. This person can also be known as the House Electrician, Master Electrician or Venue Electrician.
* Lighting Board Programmer or Light board operator: Works with the chief lighting technician to program the lights using electronic or digital light programming equipment. The goal is to create light and color effects and sequences that enhance the onstage performance.
* Lighting Technician: sets up lights and wiring, and changes lights during a show, can also be called Stage Electrician.
* Stage lighting assistant: Works with the lighting technician to set up and patch or wire up lighting, also lugs gear to different areas of the stage area. These are sometimes utility technicians that may be shared between departments during a show day, depending on need and schedule.

<text>The 1968 Rugby League World Cup was the fourth World Cup for men’s national teams and was held between 25 May and 10 June and for the first time co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. Australia were the Champions after they defeated France in the final.

== Background ==
The World Cup was initially set to be played in 1965 however, the Australian Board of Control recommended postponing the tournament to which the English Rugby League Council agreed in November 1964.

For the first time a final to determine the World Cup was specifically pre-arranged (previous finals having only been used when teams finished level on points) and the tournament made a profit for the first time.

The 1968 World Cup was the first to be played under limited tackles rules, the number then being four tackles. The round 1 match between Great Britain and Australia attracted an attendance of 62,256, the highest for a World Cup match until 1992. The final was held at the Sydney Cricket Ground; a crowd of 54,290 watched Australia defeat France. The stars of the Australian team in the tournament were skipper Johnny Raper, second-rower Ron Coote, who scored spectacular tries in each and every game, and the dead-shot kicker Eric Simms, who harvested a record 25 goals (50 points).

== Squads ==
== Venues ==

== Group Stage ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

After only twelve minutes, New Zealand second-rower Brian Lee was sent off in a match in which the classy French stand-off Jean Capdouze bagged 13 points. The game was also notable for the first World Cup substitution when Adolphe Alésina replaced second-rower Francis de Nadaï.


A record World Cup crowd of 62,256 saw New Zealand referee John Percival mercilessly penalising Great Britain, with debutant full-back Eric Simms booting a record eight goals in Australia&#x27;s win.


Simms repeated the feat of kicking eight goals as he had in the previous match as Australia eventually killed off New Zealand at Brisbane after trailing for much of the game.


France surprised Britain in a rain-ruined match at Auckland with an uncharacteristically stubborn defensive display and winger Jean-René Ledru, scoring the winning try to qualify for a World Cup final showdown against Australia.


In the final preliminary game in Brisbane, Australia&#x27;s scrum-half back Billy Smith dropped three goals. French winger Jean-René Ledru and Australia&#x27;s prop Artie Beetson were both sent off.

== Final ==
The final had been billed a &#x27;debacle&#x27; following Great Britain&#x27;s inexplicable loss to France in Auckland, resulting in France contesting the final against Australia despite having been beaten by Australia seven tries to none two days prior. Nonetheless, it attracted a record crowd of 54,290 for a World Cup final match.

The undefeated Australians went into the tournament decider as favourites. However France offered stern resistance and held the Australians to 0–7 at half-time and with quarter of an hour were only 0–12 down before losing 2–20. It was Australia&#x27;s second World Cup title.

<text>1970 Rugby League World Cup was the fifth World Cup for men&#x27;s National rugby league teams. Held between 27 October and 7 November and hosted in England. It was won by Australia who defeated Great Britain in the final.

After winning the tournament, the Australian team put the World Cup trophy on display in the Midland Hotel in Bradford. From there it was stolen and remained unseen for the next 20 years.

== Squads ==
== Venues ==
Headingley in Leeds hosted a group game between Great Britain and Australia and also hosted the World Cup final.

== Results ==
Australia beat the Kiwis easily at Wigan in the opening fixture with Eric Simms repeating his form of the 1968 tourney by landing a record ten goals.


Britain came from 0–4 behind to defeat Australia 11–4 at Headingley with Syd Hynes scoring the game&#x27;s only try.

The try of the tournament was scored by the sensational French winger Serge Marsolan against New Zealand in a mud-bath at Hull. Marsolan ran from behind his own line for a try fit to win any match but the lackadaisical French lost 15–16.

The French put up a great fight against Britain in vile conditions, only to lose 0–6 at Castleford to three penalties from Ray Dutton.


Britain eliminated New Zealand from the tournament, cruising to victory with five tries to three.

This incredibly exciting game has been described as the tournament&#x27;s piece de resistance. Aussie centre Bobby Fulton scored a try within seconds of the kick-off – probably the quickest ever in international matches. However, with ten minutes to go and the scores level at 15–15, the French stole the game when stand-off half Jean Capdouze dropped a monster goal. The Kangaroos&#x27; loss to France meant it was Australia&#x27;s superior points differential (on the back of their pointsfest in the opening game against New Zealand) alone that got them into the final with the undefeated Great Britain team.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

=== Final ===



Having retained the Ashes, Great Britain were favourites to win the final, which would become known as the &#x27;Battle of Headingley&#x27; due to its brutality. However it went completely against expectations as Britain failed to play any decent football despite overwhelming possession. The Kangaroos led 5–4 at half-time with a try to Australian three-quarter, Father John Cootes. They went on to utilise their meagre chances to the full, running out 12–7 victors. The game itself was an extended punch-up. The only surprise was that it took 79 minutes before anyone was sent off. Two sacrificial lambs, Billy Smith of Australia and Syd Hynes of Britain, were sent off the field in the last minute for what had been going unpunished throughout the game.

<text>The sei whale ( , ; Balaenoptera borealis) is a baleen whale. It is one of ten rorqual species, and the third-largest member after the blue and fin whales. It can grow to in length and weigh as much as . Two subspecies are recognized: &quot;B. b. borealis&quot; and &quot;B. b. schlegelii&quot;. The whale&#x27;s ventral surface has sporadic markings ranging from light grey to white, and its body is usually dark steel grey in colour. It is among the fastest of all cetaceans, and can reach speeds of up to over short distances. 

It inhabits most oceans and adjoining seas, and prefers deep offshore waters. It avoids polar and tropical waters and semi-enclosed bodies of water. The sei whale migrates annually from cool, subpolar waters in summer to temperate, subtropical waters in winter with a lifespan of 70 years. It is a filter feeder, with its diet consisting primarily of copepods, krill, and other zooplankton. It is typically solitary or can be found in groups numbering half a dozen. During the breeding period, a mating pair will remain together. Sei whale vocalizations usually lasts half a second, and occurs at 240–625 hertz.

Following large-scale commercial whaling during the late 19th and 20th centuries, when over 255,000 whales were killed, the sei whale is now internationally protected. It is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List, despite increasing populations. The Northern Hemisphere population is listed under CITES Appendix II, which indicates they are not threatened with extinction, while the Southern Hemisphere population is listed under CITES Appendix I, indicating that they are threatened and are given the highest levels of protection.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Sei whale&quot; is an anglicization of the Norwegian &quot;seihval&quot;, meaning &quot;pollock whale&quot;. The species was so called because it &quot;appeared off the coast of Norway at the same time each year as the pollock that came to feed on the abundant plankton&quot;. In the Pacific, the whale has been called the Japan finner; &quot;finner&quot; was a common term used to refer to rorquals. It has also been referred to as the lesser fin whale because it somewhat resembles the fin whale.

== Taxonomy ==
On 21 February 1819, Swedish-born German naturalist Karl Rudolphi initially identified a whale stranded near Grömitz, in Schleswig-Holstein, as &quot;Balaena rostrata&quot; (&quot;Balaenoptera acutorostrata&quot;). In 1823, the French naturalist Georges Cuvier described Rudolphi&#x27;s specimen under the name &quot;rorqual du Nord&quot;. In 1828, Rene Lesson translated this term into &quot;Balaenoptera borealis&quot;, basing his designation partly on Cuvier&#x27;s description of Rudolphi&#x27;s specimen and partly on a female that had stranded on the coast of France the previous year (this was later identified as a juvenile fin whale, &quot;Balaenoptera physalus&quot;). In 1846, the English zoologist John Edward Gray, ignoring Lesson&#x27;s designation, named Rudolphi&#x27;s specimen &quot;Balaenoptera laticeps&quot;, which others followed. In 1865, British zoologist William Henry Flower named a specimen that had been obtained from Pekalongan, on the north coast of Java, &quot;Sibbaldius&quot; (&quot;Balaenoptera&quot;) &quot;schlegelii&quot;—in 1946 the Russian scientist A.G. Tomilin synonymized &quot;S. schlegelii&quot; and &quot;B. borealis&quot;, creating the subspecies &quot;B. b. schlegelii&quot; and &quot;B. b. borealis&quot;. In 1884–85, the Norwegian scientist G. A. Guldberg first identified the &quot;sejhval&quot; of Finnmark with &quot;B. borealis&quot;.

Sei whales are rorquals (family Balaenopteridae), baleen whales that include the humpback whale, the blue whale, Bryde&#x27;s whale, the fin whale, and the minke whale. Rorquals take their name from the Norwegian word &quot;røyrkval&quot;, meaning &quot;furrow whale&quot;, because family members have a series of longitudinal pleats or grooves on the anterior half of their ventral surface. Balaenopterids diverged from the other families of suborder Mysticeti, also called the whalebone whales, as long ago as the middle Miocene. Little is known about when members of the various families in the Mysticeti, including the Balaenopteridae, diverged from each other. Whole genome sequencing suggests that sei and blue whales are closely related, with gray whales as a sister group. This study also found significant gene flow between minke whales and the ancestors of the blue and sei whale.

Two subspecies have been identified—the northern sei whale (&quot;B. b. borealis&quot;) and southern sei whale (&quot;B. b. schlegelii&quot;).

== Description ==
The sei whale&#x27;s body is typically a dark steel grey with irregular light grey to white markings on the ventral surface, or towards the front of the lower body. The whale has a relatively short series of 32–60 pleats or grooves along its ventral surface that extend halfway between the pectoral fins and umbilicus (in other species it usually extends to or past the umbilicus), restricting the expansion of the buccal cavity during feeding compared to other species. The rostrum is pointed and the pectoral fins are relatively short, only 9–10% of body length, and pointed at the tips. Sei whales have a solitary ridge extending from the tip of the rostrum to the paired blowholes that are a distinctive characteristic of baleen whales.

Its skin is often marked by pits or wounds, which after healing become white scars. These are now known to be caused by cookie-cutter sharks (&quot;Isistius brasiliensis&quot;). It has a tall, sickle-shaped dorsal fin that ranges in height from and averages , about two-thirds of the way back from the tip of the rostrum. Dorsal fin shape, pigmentation pattern, and scarring have been used to a limited extent in photo-identification studies. The tail is thick and the fluke, or lobe, is relatively small in relation to the size of the whale&#x27;s body.

Adults have 300–380 ashy-black baleen plates on each side of the mouth, up to long. Each plate is made of fingernail-like keratin, which is bordered by a fringe of very fine, short, curly, wool-like white bristles. The sei&#x27;s very fine baleen bristles, about , are the most reliable characteristic that distinguishes it from other rorquals.

The sei whale looks very similar to other large rorquals, especially to its smaller relative the Bryde&#x27;s whale. Exceptional individuals may resemble a fin whale, which leads to confusion. They are usually differentiated from the fin whale by the colour of their head. Contrary to the fin whale&#x27;s smooth rostrum, the sei whale&#x27;s rostrum is curved.

=== Size ===
The sei whale is the third-largest balaenopterid, after the blue whale and the fin whale. Adults usually weigh between . They exhibit sexual dimorphism, with females outweighing and being longer than their male counterparts. At birth, a calf typically measures in length.

In the Northern Hemisphere, males reach up to and females up to , while in the Southern Hemisphere males reach a maximum of and females of . The authenticity of an alleged female caught northwest of St. Kilda in July 1911 is doubted. Five specimens taken off Iceland exceeded in length. The longest measured during JARPN II cruises in the North Pacific were a female and a male.

In the North Pacific, adult males average and adult females . In the North Atlantic, the average length of an adult male is and of an adult female is . In the Southern Hemisphere, they average and , in males and females, respectively.

In the North Pacific, males weigh an average of and females . North Atlantic sei whale males average and females . Southern Hemisphere whales average in body weight.

== Life history ==

=== Surface behaviours ===
Very little is known about the sei whale social structure. They have been documented traveling alone or in pods of up to six individuals; larger groups may assemble at particularly abundant feeding grounds. During the southern Gulf of Maine influx in mid-1986, groups of at least three sei whales were observed &quot;milling&quot; on four occasions – i.e. moving in random directions, rolling, and remaining at the surface for over 10 minutes. One whale would always leave the group during or immediately after such socializing bouts.
The sei whale is among the fastest cetaceans. The American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews compared the sei whale to the cheetah, because it can swim at great speeds &quot;for a few hundred yards&quot;, but it &quot;soon tires if the chase is long&quot; and &quot;does not have the strength and staying power of its larger relatives&quot;. It can reach speeds of up to over short distances. However, it is not a remarkable diver, reaching relatively shallow depths for 5 to 15 minutes. Between dives, the whale surfaces for a few minutes, remaining visible in clear, calm waters, with blows occurring at intervals of about 60 seconds (range: 45–90 sec.). When about to dive, the sei whale usually just sinks below the surface; only the dorsal fin and blowholes protrude. The whale is generally less active on water surfaces than other whale species; they rarely exhibit lobtail behaviour.

=== Feeding ===

This rorqual is a filter feeder, using its baleen plates to obtain its food by opening its mouth, engulfing or skimming large amounts of the water containing the food, then straining the water out through the baleen, trapping any food items inside its mouth.

The sei whale feeds near the surface of the ocean, swimming on its side through swarms of prey to obtain its average of about of food each day. For an animal of its size, its preferred prey lies low within the food chain; this includes zooplankton and small fish. The whale&#x27;s diet preferences has been determined from stomach analyses, direct observation of feeding behavior, and analyzing fecal matter collected near them, which appears as a dilute brown cloud. The feces are collected in nets and DNA is separated, individually identified, and matched with known species. The whale competes for food against different baleen whales.

In the North Atlantic, it feeds primarily on calanoid copepods, specifically &quot;Calanus finmarchicus&quot;, with a secondary preference for euphausiids, in particular &quot;Meganyctiphanes norvegica&quot; and &quot;Thysanoessa inermis&quot;. In the North Pacific, it feeds on similar zooplankton, including the copepod species &quot;Neocalanus cristatus&quot;, &quot;N. plumchrus&quot;, and &quot;Calanus pacificus&quot;, and euphausiid species &quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot;, &quot;E. similis&quot;, &quot;Thysanoessa inermis&quot;, &quot;T. longipes&quot;, &quot;T. gregaria&quot; and &quot;T. spinifera&quot;. In addition, it eats larger organisms, such as the Japanese flying squid, &quot;Todarodes pacificus pacificus&quot;, and small fish, including anchovies (&quot;Engraulis japonicus&quot; and &quot;E. mordax&quot;), sardines (&quot;Sardinops sagax&quot;), Pacific saury (&quot;Cololabis saira&quot;), mackerel (&quot;Scomber japonicus&quot; and &quot;S. australasicus&quot;), jack mackerel (&quot;Trachurus symmetricus&quot;) and juvenile rockfish (&quot;Sebastes jordani&quot;). Off central California, they mainly feed on anchovies between June and August, and on krill (&quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot;) during September and October. In the Southern Hemisphere, prey species include the copepods &quot;Neocalanus tonsus&quot;, &quot;Calanus simillimus&quot;, and &quot;Drepanopus pectinatus&quot;, as well as the euphausiids &quot;Euphausia superba&quot; and &quot;Euphausia vallentini&quot; and the pelagic amphipod &quot;Themisto gaudichaudii&quot;.

===Parasites and epibiotics===

Ectoparasites and epibiotics are rare on sei whales. Species of the parasitic copepod &quot;Pennella&quot; were only found on 8% of sei whales caught off California and 4% of those taken off South Georgia and South Africa. The pseudo-stalked barnacle &quot;Xenobalanus globicipitis&quot; was found on 9% of individuals caught off California; it was also found on a sei whale taken off South Africa. The acorn barnacle &quot;Coronula reginae&quot; and the stalked barnacle &quot;Conchoderma virgatum&quot; were each only found on 0.4% of whales caught off California. &quot;Remora australis&quot; were rarely found on sei whales off California (only 0.8%). They often bear scars from the bites of cookiecutter sharks, with 100% of individuals sampled off California, South Africa, and South Georgia having them; these scars have also been found on sei whales captured off Finnmark. Diatom (&quot;Cocconeis ceticola&quot;) films on sei whales are rare, having been found on sei whales taken off California and South Georgia.

Due to their diverse diet, endoparasites are frequent and abundant in sei whales. The harpacticoid copepod &quot;Balaenophilus unisetus&quot; infests the baleen of sei whales caught off California, South Georgia, South Africa, and Finnmark. The ciliate protozoan &quot;Haematophagus&quot; was commonly found in the baleen of sei whales taken off South Georgia (nearly 85%). They often carry heavy infestations of acanthocephalans (e.g. &quot;Bolbosoma turbinella&quot;, which was found in 40% of sei whales sampled off California; it was also found in individuals off South Georgia and Finnmark) and cestodes (e.g. &quot;Tetrabothrius affinis&quot;, found in sei whales off California and South Georgia) in the intestine, nematodes in the kidneys (&quot;Crassicauda&quot; sp., California) and stomach (&quot;Anisakis simplex&quot;, nearly 60% of whales taken off California), and flukes (&quot;Lecithodesmus spinosus&quot;, found in 38% of individuals caught off California) in the liver.

=== Reproduction ===

Mating occurs in temperate, subtropical seas during the winter. Gestation is estimated to vary around 10 months, 11 months, or one year. During the breeding period, a mating pair will remain together.

A newborn is weaned from its mother at 6–9 months of age, when it is long, so weaning takes place at the summer or autumn feeding grounds. Females reproduce every 2–3 years, usually to a single calf. In the Northern Hemisphere, males are usually and females at sexual maturity, while in the Southern Hemisphere, males average and females . The average age of sexual maturity of both sexes is 8–10 years. The whales can reach ages up to 70 years.

=== Vocalizations ===

The sei whale makes long, loud, low-frequency sounds. Relatively little is known about specific calls, but in 2003, observers noted sei whale calls in addition to sounds that could be described as &quot;growls&quot; or &quot;whooshes&quot; off the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. Many calls consisted of multiple parts at different frequencies. This combination distinguishes their calls from those of other whales. Most calls last about a second, and occur in the 37–98 hertz range, well within the range of human hearing. The maximum volume of the vocal sequences is reported as 156 decibels relative to 1 micropascal (μPa) at a reference distance of one metre. An observer situated one metre from a vocalizing whale would perceive a volume roughly equivalent to the volume of a jackhammer operating two meters away.

In November 2002, scientists recorded calls in the presence of sei whales off Maui. All the calls were downswept tonal calls, all but two ranging from a mean high frequency of 39.1 Hz down to 21 Hz of 1.3 second duration – the two higher frequency downswept calls ranged from an average of 100.3 Hz to 44.6 Hz over 1 second of duration. These calls closely resembled and coincided with a peak in &quot;20- to 35-Hz irregular repetition interval&quot; downswept pulses described from seafloor recordings off Oahu, which had previously been attributed to fin whales. Between 2005 and 2007, low frequency downswept vocalizations were recorded in the Great South Channel, east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, which were associated with the presence of sei whales. These calls averaged 82.3 Hz down to 34 Hz over about 1.4 seconds in duration. This call has also been reported from recordings in the Gulf of Maine, New England shelf waters, the mid-Atlantic Bight, and in Davis Strait. It likely functions as a contact call.

BBC News quoted Roddy Morrison, a former whaler active in South Georgia, as saying, &quot;When we killed the sei whales, they used to make a noise, like a crying noise. They seemed so friendly, and they&#x27;d come round and they&#x27;d make a noise, and when you hit them, they cried really. I didn&#x27;t think it was really nice to do that. Everybody talked about it at the time I suppose, but it was money. At the end of the day that&#x27;s what counted at the time. That&#x27;s what we were there for.&quot;

== Range and migration ==
Sei whales live in all oceans, although rarely in polar or tropical waters. The difficulty of differentiating them at sea from their close relatives, Bryde&#x27;s whales and in some cases from fin whales, creates confusion about their range and population, especially in warmer waters where Bryde&#x27;s whales are most common.

In the North Atlantic, its range extends from southern Europe or northwestern Africa to Norway, and from the southern United States to Greenland. The southernmost confirmed records are strandings along the northern Gulf of Mexico and in the Greater Antilles. It rarely enters the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, which are both considered to be small waterbodies. Sei whales are pelagic and are typically found in basins in oceans or open seas.

In the North Pacific, it ranges from 20°N to 23°N latitude in the winter, and from 35°N to 50°N latitude in the summer. Approximately 75% of the North Pacific population lives east of the International Date Line. , the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service estimated that the eastern North Pacific population stood at 374 whales. Two whales tagged in deep waters off California were later recaptured off Washington and British Columbia, revealing a possible link between these areas, but the lack of other tag recovery data makes these two cases inconclusive. Occurrences within the Gulf of California have been fewer. In Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk, whales are not common, although whales were more commonly seen than today in southern part of Sea of Japan. There had been a sighting in Golden Horn Bay, and whales were much more abundant in the triangle area around Kunashir Island in whaling days, making the area well known as sei – ground. There had been sightings of the species off the Sea of Japan during cetacean surveys.

Sei whales have been recorded from northern Indian Ocean as well such as around Sri Lanka and Indian coasts. In the Southern Hemisphere, summer distribution based upon historic catch data is between 40°S and 50°S latitude in the South Atlantic and southern Indian Oceans and 45°S and 60°S in the South Pacific, while winter distribution is poorly known, with former winter whaling grounds being located off northeastern Brazil (7°S) and Peru (6°S). The majority of the &quot;sei&quot; whales caught off Angola and Congo, as well as other nearby areas in equatorial West Africa, are thought to have been predominantly misidentified Bryde&#x27;s whales. For example, Ruud (1952) found that 42 of the &quot;sei whale&quot; caught off Gabon in 1952 were actually Bryde&#x27;s whales, based on examination of their baleen plates. The only confirmed historical record is the capture of a female, which was brought to the Cap Lopez whaling station in Gabon in September 1950. During cetacean sighting surveys off Angola between 2003 and 2006, only a single confirmed sighting of two individuals was made in August 2004, compared to 19 sightings of Bryde&#x27;s whales. Sei whales are commonly distributed along west to southern Latin America, including the entire Chilean coast down to the Beagle Channel. The Falkland Islands appear to be a regionally important area for the sei whale, as a small population exists in coastal waters off the eastern Falkland or Malvinas archipelago. For reasons unknown, the whales prefer to stay inland here, even venturing into large bays.

=== Migration ===
In general, the sei whale migrates annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to temperate and subtropical waters for winter, where food is more abundant. In the northwest Atlantic, sightings and catch records suggest the whales move north along the shelf edge to arrive in the areas of Georges Bank, Northeast Channel, and Browns Bank by mid- to late- June. They are present off the south coast of Newfoundland in August and September, and a southbound migration begins moving west and south along the Nova Scotian shelf from mid-September to mid-November. Whales in the Labrador Sea as early as the first week of June may move farther northward and arrive at waters southwest of Greenland later in the summer. In the northeast Atlantic, the sei whale winters as far south as West Africa such as off Bay of Arguin, off coastal Western Sahara and follows the continental slope northward in spring. Large females lead the northward migration and reach the Denmark Strait earlier and more reliably than other sexes and classes, arriving in mid-July and remaining through mid-September. In some years, males and younger females remain at lower latitudes during the summer.

Despite knowing some general migration patterns, exact routes are incompletely known and scientists cannot readily predict exactly where groups will appear from one year to the next. A 1985 study suggested a correlation between appearances west of Greenland and the incursion of relatively warm waters from the Irminger Current into that area. Some evidence from tagging data indicates individuals return off the coast of Iceland on an annual basis. An individual satellite-tagged off Faial, in the Azores, traveled more than to the Labrador Sea via the Charlie-Gibbs fracture zone (CGFZ) between April and June 2005. It appeared to &quot;hitch a ride&quot; on prevailing currents, with erratic movements indicative of feeding behavior in five areas, in particular the CGFZ, an area of known high sei whale abundance as well as high copepod concentrations. Seven whales tagged off Faial and Pico from May to June in 2008 and 2009 made their way to the Labrador Sea, while an eighth individual tagged in September 2009 headed southeast – its signal was lost between Madeira and the Canary Islands.

== Whaling ==

The development of explosive harpoons and steam-powered whaling ships in the late nineteenth century brought previously unobtainable large whales within the reach of commercial whalers. Initially, the sei whale&#x27;s speed and elusiveness partially protected them, and later the comparatively small yield of oil and meat. Once stocks of more profitable right whales, blue whales, fin whales, and humpback whales became depleted, sei whales were hunted in earnest, particularly from 1950 to 1980.

=== North Atlantic ===

In the North Atlantic between 1885 and 1984, 14,295 sei whales were taken. They were hunted in large numbers off the coasts of Norway and Scotland beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and in 1885 alone more than 700 were caught off Finnmark. Their meat was a popular Norwegian food. The meat&#x27;s value made the hunting of this difficult-to-catch species profitable in the early twentieth century.

In Iceland, a total of 2,574 whales were taken from the Hvalfjörður whaling station between 1948 and 1985. Since the late 1960s to early 1970s, the sei whale was second only to the fin whale as the preferred target of Icelandic whalers, with meat in greater demand than whale oil, the prior target.

Small numbers were taken off the Iberian Peninsula, beginning in the 1920s by Spanish whalers, off the Nova Scotian shelf in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Canadian whalers, and off the coast of West Greenland from the 1920s to the 1950s by Norwegian and Danish whalers.

=== North Pacific ===

In the North Pacific, the total reported catch by commercial whalers was 72,215 between 1910 and 1975; the majority were taken after 1947. Shore stations in Japan and Korea processed 300–600 each year between 1911 and 1955. In 1959, the Japanese catch peaked at 1,340. Heavy exploitation in the North Pacific began in the early 1960s, with catches averaging 3,643 per year from 1963 to 1974 (total 43,719; annual range 1,280–6,053). In 1971, after a decade of high catches, it became scarce in Japanese waters, ending commercial whaling in the country by 1975.

Off the coast of North America, sei whales were hunted off British Columbia from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, when the number of whales captured dropped to around 14 per year. More than 2,000 were caught in British Columbian waters between 1962 and 1967. Between 1957 and 1971, California shore stations processed 386 whales. Commercial Sei whaling ended in the eastern North Pacific in 1971.

=== Southern Hemisphere ===
A total of 152,233 were taken in the Southern Hemisphere between 1910 and 1979. Whaling in southern oceans originally targeted humpback whales. By 1913, this species became rare, and the catch of fin and blue whales began to increase. As these species likewise became scarce, sei whale catches increased rapidly in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The catch peaked in 1964–65 at over 20,000 sei whales, but by 1976, this number had dropped to below 2,000 and commercial whaling for the species ended in 1977.

=== Post-protection whaling ===
Since the moratorium on commercial whaling, some sei whales have been taken by Icelandic and Japanese whalers under the IWC&#x27;s scientific research programme. Iceland carried out four years of scientific whaling between 1986 and 1989, killing up to 40 sei whales a year.
The research is conducted by the Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) in Tokyo, a privately funded, nonprofit institution. The main focus of the research is to examine what they eat and to assess the competition between whales and fisheries. In a span of 15 years, around 1,453 whales were killed in the North Pacific between 2002 and 2017.

Conservation groups, such as the World Wildlife Fund, dispute the value of this research, claiming that sei whales feed primarily on squid and plankton which are not hunted by humans, and only rarely on fish. At the 2001 meeting of the IWC Scientific Committee, 32 scientists submitted a document expressing their belief that the Japanese program lacked scientific rigor and would not meet minimum standards of academic review.

In 2010, a Los Angeles exclusive sushi restaurant confirmed to be serving sei whale meat was closed by its owners after a covert investigation and protests lead to prosecution by authorities for handling an endangered/protected species.

== Conservation status ==
The sei whale is listed by the IUCN Red List as endangered, and with an increasing population trend, as of 2018. The sei whale did not have meaningful international protection until 1970, when the International Whaling Commission first set catch quotas for the North Pacific for individual species. Before quotas, there were no legal limits. Complete protection from commercial whaling in the North Pacific came in 1976.

Quotas on sei whales in the North Atlantic began in 1977. Southern Hemisphere stocks were protected in 1979. Facing mounting evidence that several whale species were threatened with extinction, the IWC established a complete moratorium on commercial whaling beginning in 1986. In the late 1970s, some &quot;pirate&quot; whaling took place in the eastern North Atlantic. There is no direct evidence of illegal whaling in the North Pacific, despite the acknowledged misreporting of whaling data by the Soviet Union.

Northern Hemisphere populations are listed in CITES Appendix II, indicating they are not immediately threatened with extinction, but may become so if they are not listed. Populations in the Southern Hemisphere are listed in CITES Appendix I, indicating they are threatened with extinction if trade is not halted. The sei whale is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, and also on Appendix II. The species is listed as endangered by the U.S. government National Marine Fisheries Service under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.

As of 2018, the global population is estimated to be 50,000 mature individuals, with an increasing population trend. In the North Atlantic, 12,000 whales were estimated. As of 1983, around 10,000 whales were estimated in the Southern Hemisphere, and by 2011, approximately 35,000 individuals inhabited the North Pacific.

Sei whales were said to have been scarce in the 1960s and early 1970s off northern Norway. One possible explanation for this disappearance is that the whales were overexploited. The drastic reduction in northeastern Atlantic copepod stocks during the late 1960s may be another culprit. Surveys in the Denmark Strait found 1,290 whales in 1987, and 1,590 whales in 1989. Nova Scotia&#x27;s 1977 population estimates were between 1,393 and 2,248, with a minimum of 870.

A 1977 study estimated Pacific Ocean totals of 9,110, based upon catch and CPUE data. Japanese interests claim this figure is outdated, and in 2002 claimed the western North Pacific population was over 28,000, a figure not accepted by the scientific community. In western Canadian waters, researchers with Fisheries and Oceans Canada observed five seis together in the summer of 2017, the first such sighting in over 50 years. In California waters, there was only one confirmed and five possible sightings by 1991 to 1993 aerial and ship surveys, and there were no confirmed sightings off Oregon coasts such as Maumee Bay and Washington. Prior to commercial whaling, the North Pacific hosted an estimated 42,000. By the end of whaling, the population was down to between 7,260 and 12,620. In the Southern Hemisphere, population estimates range between 9,800 and 12,000, based upon catch history and CPUE. The IWC estimated 9,718 whales based upon survey data between 1978 and 1988. Prior to commercial whaling, there were an estimated 65,000.

Mass death events for sei whales have been recorded for many years and evidence suggests endemic poisoning (red tide) may have caused mass deaths in prehistoric times. In June 2015, scientists flying over southern Chile counted 337 dead sei whales, in what is regarded as the largest mass beaching ever documented. The cause is not yet known; however, toxic algae blooms caused by unprecedented warming in the Pacific Ocean, known as the Blob, may be implicated.

<text>The sixth [[Rugby League World Cup]] was held in France in October and November 1972. Australia started as the favourites to retain the trophy they had won just two years previously. New Zealand had beaten all three of the other nations in 1971 and France were expected to be tough opponents on their home soil. In the event Great Britain confounded most expectations by running out worthy winners and levelling their tally of World Cup wins at 3–3 with the Australians.

The final was held at Stade Gerland in Lyon. Great Britain played Australia and in the end, with scores level and unchanged after extra time, claimed the cup on league placing.

This was the last World Cup to be played under the four-tackle rule.

The French public seemed uninterested in a final that did not involve the home team, as just over 4,200 spectators turned up. The game will always be remembered by the British for their captain Clive Sullivan&#x27;s wonderful long distance try and by the Australians for perhaps &quot;the greatest try never scored&quot;, later shown on TV to be legitimately scored by Australian fullback Graeme Langlands but disallowed by French referee Georges Jameau. Mike Stephenson scored the 73rd-minute try that helped Great Britain level the scores and secure the World Cup. Had Aussie winger Ray Branighan succeeded with a 79th-minute penalty or Bob Fulton landed one of three drop goal attempts in the last five minutes, the cup could easily have gone to Australia. But for the first time in the competition&#x27;s history the scores were level at full-time. An additional twenty minutes extra time was played, but no further score resulted, and Great Britain were awarded the cup by virtue of a better position in the table.

<text>The Nabataeans or Nabateans (; Nabataean Aramaic: , , vocalized as ) were an ancient Arab people who inhabited northern Arabia and the southern Levant. Their settlements—most prominently the assumed capital city of Raqmu (present-day Petra, Jordan)—gave the name &quot;Nabatene&quot; () to the Arabian borderland that stretched from the Euphrates to the Red Sea. The Nabateans emerged as a distinct civilization and political entity between the 4th and 2nd centuries BC, with their kingdom centered around a loosely controlled trading network that brought considerable wealth and influence across the ancient world.

Described as fiercely independent by contemporary Greco-Roman accounts, the Nabataeans were annexed into the Roman Empire by Emperor Trajan in 106 AD. Nabataeans&#x27; individual culture, easily identified by their characteristic finely potted painted ceramics, was adopted into the larger Greco-Roman culture. They converted to Christianity during the Later Roman Era. They have been described as one of the most gifted peoples of the ancient world and one of the &quot;most unjustly forgotten&quot;.

==History==
===Hellenistic period===
The Nabataeans were an Arab tribe who had come under significant Babylonian-Aramaean influence. The first mention of the Nabataeans dates from 312/311 BC, when they were attacked at Sela or perhaps at Petra without success by Antigonus I&#x27;s officer Athenaeus in the course of the Third War of the Diadochi; at that time Hieronymus of Cardia, a Seleucid officer, mentions the Nabataeans in a battle report. About 50 BC Greek historian Diodorus Siculus cites Hieronymus in his report and adds the following: &quot;Just as the Seleucids had tried to subdue them, so the Romans made several attempts to get their hands on that lucrative trade.&quot;

They wrote a letter to Antigonus in Syriac letters, and Aramaic continued as the language of their coins and inscriptions when the tribe grew into a kingdom and profited by the decay of the Seleucids to extend its borders northward over the more fertile country east of the Jordan River. They occupied Hauran, and in about 85 BC their king Aretas III became lord of Damascus and Coele-Syria.

====Nabataean Kingdom====


Petra was rapidly built in the 1st century BC and developed a population estimated at 20,000. The Nabataeans were allies of the first Hasmoneans in their struggles against the Seleucid monarchs. They then became rivals of the Judaean dynasty and a chief element in the disorders that invited Pompey&#x27;s intervention in Judea. According to popular historian Paul Johnson, many Nabataeans were forcefully converted to Judaism by Hasmonean king Alexander Jannaeus. It was this king who, after putting down a local rebellion, invaded and occupied the Nabataean towns of Moab and Gilead and imposed a tribute. Obodas I knew that Alexander would attack, so was able to ambush Alexander&#x27;s forces near Gaulane destroying the Judean army in 90 BC.

The Roman military was not very successful in their campaigns against the Nabataeans. In 62 BC, Marcus Aemilius Scaurus accepted a bribe of 300 talents to lift the siege of Petra, partly because of the difficult terrain and the fact that he had run out of supplies. Hyrcanus II, who was a friend of King Aretas, was despatched by Scaurus to the king to buy peace. In so obtaining peace, Aretas retained all his possessions, including Damascus, and became a Roman vassal.

In 32 BC, during King Malichus I&#x27;s reign, Herod the Great, with the support of Cleopatra, started a war against Nabataea. The war began with Herod plundering Nabataea with a large cavalry force and occupying Dium. After this defeat, the Nabataean forces regrouped near Canatha in Syria but were attacked and routed. Cleopatra&#x27;s general Athenion sent Canathans to the aid of the Nabataeans, and this force crushed Herod&#x27;s army, which then fled to Ormiza. One year later, Herod&#x27;s army overran Nabataea.
After an earthquake in Judaea, the Nabateans rebelled and invaded Judea, but Herod at once crossed the Jordan River to Philadelphia (modern Amman), and both sides set up camp. The Nabataeans under Elthemus refused to give battle, so Herod forced the issue when he attacked their camp. A confused mass of Nabataeans gave battle but were defeated. Once they had retreated to their defences, Herod laid siege to the camp, and over time some of the defenders surrendered. The remaining Nabataean forces offered 500 talents for peace, but this was rejected. Lacking water, the Nabataeans were forced out of their camp and battled but were defeated. King Aretas IV defeated Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, in a battle after he intended to divorce his daughter Phasaelis

===Roman period===
An ally of the Roman Empire, the Nabataean kingdom flourished throughout the 1st century. Its power extended far into Arabia along the Red Sea to Yemen, and Petra was a cosmopolitan marketplace, though its commerce was diminished by the rise of the Eastern trade route from Myos Hormos to Coptos on the Nile. Under the &quot;Pax Romana&quot;, the Nabataeans lost their warlike and nomadic habits and became a sober, acquisitive, orderly people, wholly intent on trade and agriculture. The kingdom was a bulwark between Rome and the wild hordes of the desert except in the time of Trajan, who reduced Petra and converted the Nabataean client state into the Roman province of Arabia Petraea. There was a Nabataean community in Puteoli, in southern Italy, that reached its end around the establishment of the province.

Five Greek-Nabataean bilingual inscriptions, known as the Ruwafa inscriptions, date to AD 165–169, . They are ascribed to an auxiliary military unit drawn from the Roman-allied Thamud tribe and were built to describe the temple they were inscribed in and to recognize the authority of the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus.

By the 3rd century the Nabataeans had stopped writing in Aramaic and begun writing in Greek. By the 5th century they had converted to Christianity. Their lands were divided between the new Qahtanite Arab tribal kingdoms of the Byzantine vassals, the Ghassanid Arabs, and the Himyarite vassals, the Kingdom of Kinda in North Arabia. 

==Culture==
Many examples of graffiti and inscriptions—largely of names and greetings—document the area of Nabataean culture, which extended as far north as the north end of the Dead Sea, and testify to widespread literacy; but except for a few letters no Nabataean literature has survived, nor was any noted in antiquity. Onomastic analysis has suggested that Nabataean culture may have had multiple influences. Classical references to the Nabataeans begin with Diodorus Siculus. They suggest that the Nabataeans&#x27; trade routes and the origins of their goods were regarded as trade secrets, and disguised in tales that should have strained outsiders&#x27; credulity.

Diodorus Siculus (book II) describes them as a strong tribe of some 10,000 warriors, preeminent among the nomads of Arabia, eschewing agriculture, fixed houses, and the use of wine, but adding to pastoral pursuits a profitable trade with the seaports in frankincense, myrrh and spices from Arabia Felix, as well as a trade with Egypt in bitumen from the Dead Sea. Their arid country was their best safeguard, for the bottle-shaped cisterns for rain-water which they excavated in the rocky or clay-rich soil were carefully concealed from invaders.

Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Tabikh&quot;, the earliest known Arabic cookbook, contains a recipe for fermented Nabatean water bread (). The yeast-leavened bread is made with a high quality wheat flour called &quot;samidh&quot; that is finely milled and free of bran and is baked in a tandoor.

===Women===

Based on coins, inscriptions and non-Nabatean contemporary sources, Nabataean women seem to have had many legal rights. Inscriptions on tombs demonstrate the equality of property rights between man and woman and women&#x27;s rights in matters of inheritance and also their ability to make decisions about their own property. That set the Nabateans apart from the attitudes on a woman&#x27;s role in society by their neighbours in the region. Women also participated in religious activities, and had a right to visit the temples and make sacrifices.

Archeological evidence strongly suggest that the Nabataean women had a role in the social and political life by the 1st century AD, which is shown by the fact that Nabatean queens were depicted on coins, both independently and together with their spouse the king. The assumption to be made from this were that they ruled together and that the Nabatean queens and other female members were given or already had political importance and status. It is likely other Nabatean women benefited from this by extension.

Though Nabatean culture seems to have favored male succession rather than female or equal succession, it seems plausible that like their neighbouring Ptolemaic dynasty and the Seleucids, marrying a female member of the Nabatean royal family reinforced a ruler&#x27;s position or one whose claim to the throne was not as strong as his wife&#x27;s. The Nabatean royal house, like the Ptolemaic and Seleucids, later adopted sibling marriage.

===Fashion===
Not much is known for certain about the fashions of ancient Nabateans and before the Hellenization and Romanization of the region, but based on extant clothes and textiles found in graves and tombs on Nabatean territory, the clothing worn by the Nabateans during the 1st and 2nd century were not unlike their neighbour Judaeans. It is unknown what the Nabateans wore in more ancient times since their art before this period was non-figurative. Among the most common colors were yellow made from saffron and a bright red produced from madder. Blue textiles were also found.

Nabatean men wore a tunic and a mantle both made of wool. The tunic was a Roman style (sleeveless) and with the mantle cut in a Greek style. This reflects a popular style rather than an ethnic style exclusive to the Nabateans. Nabataean women wore long tunics along with scarves and mantles. These scarves were loosely woven and sported fringes at the bottom.
The upper class of Nabataean society, what can be seen on coins, show an even stronger Greek and Roman influence. The kings are depicted clean-shaven with long curled hair while queens are depicted wearing headcoverings with curled hair and long tunics and high-necked garments. Purple cloth seems to have been associated with the king based on Strabo&#x27;s account of Nabatean men going outside &quot;without tunics girdles about their loins, and with slippers on their feet—even the kings, though in their case the colour is purple.&quot;

===Language===

Historians such as Irfan Shahîd, Warwick Ball, Robert G. Hoyland, Michael C. A. Macdonald, and others believe Nabataeans spoke Arabic as their native language. John F. Healy states &quot;Nabataeans normally spoke a form of Arabic, while, like the Persians etc., they used Aramaic for formal purposes and especially for inscriptions.&quot; Proper names on their inscriptions suggest that they were ethnically Arabs who had come under Aramaic influence, and the Nabataeans had already some trace of Aramaic culture when they first appear in history. Some of the authors of Safaitic inscriptions identify themselves as Nabataeans.

===Religion===

The extent of Nabataean trade resulted in cross-cultural influences that reached as far as the Red Sea coast of southern Arabia. The major gods worshiped at Petra were notably Dushara and Al-‘Uzzá. Dushara was the supreme deity of the Nabataean Arabs and was the official god of the Nabataean Kingdom who enjoyed special royal patronage. His official position is reflected in multiple inscriptions that render him as &quot;The god of our lord&quot; (the king).

The name Dushara is from the Arabic &quot;Dhu ash-Shara&quot;: which simply means &quot;the one of Shara&quot;, a mountain range southeast of Petra also known as Mount Seir. Therefore, from a Nabataean perspective, Dhushara was probably associated with the heavens. However, one theory which connects Dushara with the forest gives a different idea of the god. The eagle was one of the symbols of Dushara. It was widely used in Hegra as a source of protection for the tombs against thievery.

Nabataean inscriptions from Hegra suggest that Dushara was linked either with the sun or with Mercury with which Ruda, another Arabian god, was identified. &quot;His throne&quot; was frequently mentioned in inscriptions; certain interpretations of the text consider it as a reference for Dushara&#x27;s wife, goddess Harisha. She was probably a solar deity. 

Dushara&#x27;s consort at Petra is considered to have been al-Uzza, and the goddess has been associated with Temple of Winged Lions on the basis that if the divine couple of Petra was Dushara and al-Uzza and the Qasr al Binti temple was dedicated to Dushara then the other major temple must have been al-Uzzas. This is just a theory however, based on conjecture, and it can only be said that the temple is likely dedicated to the supreme goddess figure of the Nabateans, but the identity of this goddess is uncertain. Excavated from The Temple of the Winged Lions was the &quot;Eye Baetyl&quot; or &quot;Eye-Idol&quot;.

Numerous Nabatean bas-relief busts of the northern Syrian goddess Atargatis were identified by Nelson Glueck at Khirbet et-Tannû. Atargatis was amalgamated into the worship of Al-‘Uzzá. However, when the Romans annexed the Nabataean Kingdom, Dushara still had an important role despite losing his former royal privilege. The greatest testimony to the status of the god after the fall of the Nabataean Kingdom was during the 1,000th anniversary of the founding of Rome where Dushara was celebrated in Bostra by striking coins in his name, Actia Dusaria (linking the god with Augustus victory at Actium). He was venerated in his Arabian name with a Greek fashion in the reign of an Arabian emperor, Philip. 

Other gods worshipped in Nabatea during this period were Isis, Balshamin and Obodat Sacrifices of animals were common, and Porphyry&#x27;s &quot;De Abstenentia&quot;, written in the 3rd century, states that in Dūmah a boy was sacrificed annually and was buried underneath an altar. Some scholars have extrapolated this practice to the rest of the Nabataeans, but this view is contested due to the lack of evidence.

The Nabataeans used to represent their gods as featureless pillars or blocks. Their most common monuments to the gods, commonly known as &quot;god blocks&quot;, involved cutting away the whole top of a hill or cliff face so as to leave only a block behind. However, over time the Nabataeans were influenced by Greece and Rome, and their gods became anthropomorphic and were represented with human features.

==Language==
The Nabataeans spoke an Arabic dialect but for their inscriptions used a form of Aramaic that was heavily influenced by Arabic forms and words. When communicating with other Middle Eastern peoples, they, like their neighbors, used Aramaic, the region&#x27;s &quot;lingua franca&quot;. Therefore, Aramaic was used for commercial and official purposes across the Nabataean political sphere.

The Nabataean alphabet developed out of the Aramaic alphabet, but it used a distinctive cursive script from which the Arabic alphabet emerged. There are different opinions concerning the development of the Arabic script. J. Starcky considers the Lakhmids&#x27; Syriac form script as a probable candidate. However, John F. Healey states &quot;The Nabataean origin of the Arabic script is now almost universally accepted&quot;. In surviving Nabataean documents, Aramaic legal terms are followed by their equivalents in Arabic. That could suggest that the Nabataeans used Arabic in their legal proceedings but recorded them in Aramaic. The name may be derived from the same root as Akkadian &quot;nabatu&quot;, to shine brightly.

==Agriculture==

Although not as dry as at present, the area occupied by the Nabataeans was still a desert and required special techniques for agriculture. One was to contour an area of land into a shallow funnel and to plant a single fruit tree in the middle. Before the wet season, which could easily consist of only one or two rain events, the area around the tree was broken up. When the rain came, all the water that collected in the funnel would flow down toward the tree and sink into the ground. The ground, which was largely loess, would seal up when it got wet and retain the water.

In the mid-1950s, a research team headed by Michael Evenari set up a research station near Avdat (Evenari, Shenan and Tadmor 1971). He focused on the relevance of runoff rainwater management in explaining the mechanism of the ancient agricultural features, such as terraced wadis, channels for collecting runoff rainwater, and the enigmatic phenomenon of &quot;Tuleilat el-Anab&quot;. Evenari showed that the runoff rainwater collection systems concentrate water from an area that is five times larger than the area in which the water actually drains.

==Architects and stonemasons==

* Apollodorus of Damascus - Greek-Nabataean architect and engineer from Damascus, Roman Syria, who flourished during the 2nd century AD. his massive architectural output gained him immense popularity during his time. He is one of the few architects whose name survives from antiquity, and is credited with introducing several Eastern innovations to the Roman Imperial style, such as making the dome a standard.
* Wahb&#x27;allahi - a first century stonemason who worked in the city of Hegra. Wahb&#x27;allahi was the brother of the stonemason &#x27;Abdharetat and the father of &#x27;Abd&#x27;obodat. He is named in an inscription as the responsible stonemason on the oldest datable grave in Hegra in the ninth year of the Nabataean king Aretas IV (1 BC-AD).
* &#x27;Abd&#x27;obodat son of Wahballahi - a 1st-century Nabatean Stonemason who worked in the city of Hegra. He is named by inscriptions on five of the grave facades typical of Hegra as the executing craftsman. On the basis of the inscriptions, four of the facades can be dated to the reigns of kings Aretas IV and Malichus II. &#x27;Abd&#x27;obodat was evidently a successful craftsman. He succeeded his father Wahb&#x27;allahi and his uncle &#x27;Abdharetat in at least one workshop in the second generation of Nabatean architects. &#x27;Abd&#x27;obodat is considered to be the main representative of one of the two main schools of the Nabataean stonemasons, to which his father, his uncle belonged. Two more grave facades are assigned to the school on the basis of stylistic investigations; &#x27;Abd&#x27;obodat is probably to be regarded as the stonemason who carried out the work.
* &#x27;Aftah - a Nabatean stonemason who became prominent in the beginning of the third decade of the first century. &#x27;Aftah is attested in inscriptions on eight of the grave facades in Hegra and one grave as the executing stonemason. The facades are dated to the late reign of King Aretas IV. On one of the facades he worked with Halaf&#x27;allahi, on another with Wahbu and Huru. A tenth facade without an inscription was attributed to the &#x27;Aftah sculpture school due to technical and stylistic similarities. He is the main representative of one of the two stonemason schools in the city of Hegra.
* Halaf&#x27;allahi - Nabatean stonemason who worked in the city of Hegra in the first century. Halaf&#x27;allahi is named in inscriptions on two graves in Hegra as the responsible stonemason in the reign of the Nabataean king Aretas IV. The first grave, which can be dated to the year 26-27 AD, was created together with the stonemason &#x27;Aftah. He is therefore assigned to the workshop of the &#x27;Aftah. Nabataean architects and sculptors were in reality contractors, who negotiated the costs of specific tomb types and their decorations. Tombs were therefore executed based on the desires and financial abilities of their future owners. The activities of Halaf&#x27;allahi offer an excellent example of this, as he had been commissioned with the execution of a simple tomb for a person who apparently belonged to the lower middle class. However, he was also in charge of completing a more sophisticated tomb for one of the local military officials.

<text>The 1975 Rugby League World Cup (officially known as the 1975 Rugby League World Championship) was the seventh World Cup for men’s rugby league national teams and ran from 2 March to 12 November. Australia were the winners for a fourth time after topping the group table. 

Unlike previous World Cups, there was no one host country, with the five participating nations hosting matches over eight months. Each team had to play the others on a &#x27;home and away&#x27; basis. For the first time Great Britain did not compete and instead England and Wales entered to participate for the first time, taking advantage of a glut of Welsh talent in the British game at the time.

== Teams ==
== Venues ==
14 venues across the five competing countries hosted games of the 1975 Rugby League World Cup. Wales used their own home venue at Swansea, but also played home games in England in both Salford and Warrington. England also played a &#x27;home&#x27; game against Wales at Lang Park in Brisbane, Australia.

== Results ==



In this match Mick Cronin kicked nine goals.






England winger Keith Fielding created a new record by scoring four tries against a hapless French team at Bordeaux.


Kangaroo wing prodigy Ian Schubert also scored a hat-trick tries.

English stand-off Ken Gill ran in three tries.

In this match Jim Mills, the Wales prop, was banned for the rest of the season after an altercation. The ban was eventually lifted on 2 January 1976.

=== Final standings ===
=== Final challenge match ===
As Australia had not beaten England to win the World Cup (a draw and a loss), a one off challenge match was arranged, although this was not officially classed as a Final as Australia had already been crowned Champions after topping the group. 

The Kangaroos showed they were worthy World Champions with a comprehensive 25–0 win at Headingley in front of a disappointing crowd of 7,680 which was over 11,000 less than had attended the 1970 World Cup final, between Great Britain and Australia, at the same venue. England had shown little interest in playing the game.

<doc id="377447" wikidata="Q373709" url="?curid=377447" title="Boom operator (media)">
<text>A boom operator (or First Assistant Sound) is a core role in the sound department of a film production, who works with the production sound mixer and utility sound technician. The principal responsibility of the boom operator is microphone placement, usually using a boom pole (or &quot;fishpole&quot;) with a microphone attached to the end (called a boom mic), their aim being to hold the microphone as close to the actors or action as possible without allowing the microphone or boom pole to enter the camera&#x27;s frame.

==Invention of the boom mic==
The first noted instance of a prototype boom mic was on &quot;The Wild Party&quot; (1929). To allow Clara Bow to move freely on the set, director Dorothy Arzner had technicians rig a microphone onto a fishing rod.

Another instance of a boom mic was on the set of &quot;Beggars of Life&quot; (1928) when director William A. Wellman wanted a tracking shot of two actors walking down a street, and the sound man refused, telling the director that the actors had to be static and the microphone had to be hidden in a flowery vase. Wellman said &quot;that&#x27;s crazy&quot; and instructed the sound man to put the microphone on a broom-handle and walk along the actors just outside of the frame. According to David O. Selznick, &quot;I was also present on the stage when a microphone was moved for the first time by Wellman, believe it or not. Sound was relatively new and at that time the sound engineer insisted that the microphone be steady. Wellman, who had quite a temper in those days, got very angry, took the microphone himself, hung it on a , gave orders to record—and moved it.&quot;

A patent was filed a year later for a very similar sound-recording device by Edmund H Hansen, a sound engineer at the Fox Film Corporation.

==Applications==
Often in television studios, the boom operator will use a Fisher boom, which is a more intricate and specialized piece of equipment on which the operator stands, allowing precise control of the microphone at a greater distance from the actors. They will also attach wireless microphones to persons whose voice requires recording. Boom poles are usually manufactured from several lengths of aluminum or carbon fibre tubing, allowing the boom to be extended and collapsed as the situation requires.

Some poles have a microphone cable routed through the inside of the pole, which may be a regular cable protruding at the bottom end, or a coiled cable that can extend with the pole, connecting to a socket at the base into which the operator plugs the microphone cable. The ideal boom pole is lightweight and strong, supporting the weight of the microphone on the end while adding as little weight as possible.

Frequently, a wind-attenuating cover, called a &quot;blimp&quot; or &quot;mic-blimp&quot;, is used to enclose the microphone. A blimp covered with sound-absorbing fuzzy fabric is usually nicknamed a windmuff or a &quot;dead cat&quot;. In film crew jargon, the gruesome-sounding phrase &quot;dead cat on a stick&quot; is simply a boom microphone fitted with a fuzzy wind-screen.

On feature films and TV drama boom operators will have another sound assistant working under them who will assistant in various ways; including with boom operating out of vision dialogue, applying radio microphones and rigging other pieces of equipment.

The boom operator and production sound mixer can sometimes be combined into a job performed by one person on lower budget productions, usually when the crew number is to be kept minimal, or for documentaries or news collecting. The one-man unit is often known simply as a &quot;sound recordist&quot; or &quot;sound man&quot;, and would perform all on set sound duties.

The boom operator must decide where to place the microphone based on a combination of factors, including the location and projection of any dialogue, the frame position of the camera, the source of lighting (and hence shadows) and any unwanted noise sources. Often the boom operator will need to be as familiar with the script as are the actors, as they may be required to tilt or move the microphone according to who is speaking.

In productions with a bigger budget, more than one boom operator may be used, with each operator focusing on a different actor.

Having the boom mic or its shadow appear on the screen in a completed picture is considered a sign of poor film-making. Notable examples include the mic&#x27;s shadow appearing above two crewmen flying a plane in &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot; and the mic itself dipping into the frame numerous times in Rudy Ray Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Dolemite&quot;. Pastiches of bad film-making may also use boom mic visibility to spoof their material.

Boom operators therefore need to have a high level of skill to perform their jobs to a high standard. Knowledge of various types of microphones and their applications is essential. A knowledge of camera lenses is also necessary as well a good overall technical understanding of all the varied equipment modern sound departments use. Because boom operators are required to liaise with actors and multiple departments they need to be diplomatic and have good people skills. They also need a good level of physical fitness, strength and stamina.

<text>The 1977 Rugby League World Cup was the eighth World Cup held for men’s national rugby league teams and hosted in Australia and New Zealand and ran between 29 May and 25 June. Australia were Champions after beating Great Britain in the Final at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

=== Final ===


After their 19–5 win over Great Britain a week earlier at Lang Park in Brisbane (which actually drew 2,543 more fans than the Final), the Australians went into the Final as warm favourites. However, led by experienced captain Roger Millward, the Lions managed to dominate possession throughout the game, and it took a last minute try from Australian halfback John Kolc (playing his only international game for Australia) to secure the Cup in front of 24,457 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

==== 1st Half ====
The Australian&#x27;s opened the scoring through Allan McMahon who scored in the Paddington corner. Michael Cronin kicked the sideline conversion and Australia led 5–0. Great Britain soon his back with a try to Steve Pitchford. George Fairbairn converted the try to lock the scores at 5–5. The match was then highlighted by a 60-metre try to Australian centre Russel Gartner who pounced on a dropped ball from Lions fullback Fairbairn after a Great Britain scrum win to race away and score. Only converging defence from Gartner&#x27;s opposite number Les Dyl kept him from scoring closer to the posts, giving Cronin a difficult conversion from midway between the posts and the touch line. Cronin missed the attempt and the Australian&#x27;s led 8–5. Fairbairn then kicked a penalty goal to make the scores 8–7 closing in on half time.

Late in the first half the gritty and determined Lions were considered unlucky not to score when they were denied what would have been a certain try to winger Stuart Wright by English referee Billy Thompson. Wright had intercepted a pass from Cronin to Mark Harris 15 metres from the Australian line and was racing downfield with no one near him when Thompson called play back for an obstruction penalty to Great Britain rather than play advantage. Had Wright scored, and likely under the posts, it could have given the visitors a 12–8 lead going into the break. Instead, soon after Cronoin kicked a penalty goal from in front of the posts to make the score 10–7 going into half time.

==== 2nd Half ====
Australia took the lead out to 13–7 after a try to John Kolc in the Randwick corner in front of the Bradman Stand. Fairbairn had dropped a downfield kick by Cronin and the ball was pounced upon by Allan McMahon. From acting half, Kolc then dummied which fooled Fairbairn and Bill Francis and he raced away to score in the corner. Cronin missed the difficult kick from the sideline and the score remained at 13–7.

The Lions then hit back with a try under the posts to replacement back Ken Gill which was converted by Fairbairn to bring the scores to 13–12. After Kolc was penalised for using an elbow on Roger Millward who was chasing his own chip-kick, Fairbairn then had a late chance to give Great Britain the lead with a penalty goal from 45 metres out, though his went just to the right of the posts into the waiting arms of Australian fullback Graham Eadie who took full advantage of the Lions defence line still being near halfway to run the ball back outside the Australian quarter line.

<text>A camera operator, or depending on the context cameraman or camerawoman, is a professional operator of a film camera or video camera as part of a film crew. The term &quot;cameraman&quot; does not necessarily imply that a male is performing the task.

==Duties and functions==
In filmmaking, the cinematographer or director of photography (DP or DoP) is responsible for bringing Director&#x27;s vision to life on screen. The Cinematographer or Director of Photography handles all the technical aspects of visual storytelling and is the head of the camera crew and light crew on the set. The DP may operate the camera themselves, or enlist the aid of a camera operator or second cameraman to operate it or set the controls. The first assistant cameraman (1st AC), also known as a focus puller, is responsible for maintenance of the camera, such as clearing dirt from the film gate and adjusting the follow focus. A second assistant cameraman (2nd AC), also known as a clapper loader, might be employed to load film, slate scenes, or maintain the camera report (a log of scenes, takes, rolls, photographic filters used, and other production data).

A camera operator in a video production may be known by titles like , , or , depending on the context and technology involved, usually operating a professional video camera. As of 2016, there were approximately 59,300 television, video, and motion picture camera operators employed in the United States.

Important camera operator skills include choreographing and framing shots, knowledge of and the ability to select appropriate camera lenses, and other equipment (dollies, camera cranes, etc.) to portray dramatic scenes. The principles of dramatic storytelling and film editing fundamentals are also important skills. The camera operator is required to communicate clearly and concisely on sets where time and film budget constraints are ever present.

<doc id="377454" wikidata="Q1189953" url="?curid=377454" title="Soundboard (music)">
<text>A soundboard (occasionally called a sounding board) is the surface of a string instrument that the strings vibrate against, usually via some sort of bridge. Pianos, guitars, banjos, and many other stringed instruments incorporate soundboards. The resonant properties of the soundboard and the interior of the instrument greatly increase the loudness of the vibrating strings. &quot;The sound board is probably the most important element of a guitar in terms of its influence on the quality of the instrument&#x27;s tone .&quot;

The soundboard operates by the principle of forced vibration. The string gently vibrates the board, and despite their differences in size and composition, makes the board vibrate at exactly the same frequency. This produces the same sound as the string alone, differing only in timbre. The string would produce the same amount of energy without the board present, but the greater surface area of the soundboard moves a greater volume of air, which produces a louder sound. &quot;Generally, stiffer boards will give a brighter edge to the sound than softer, more flexible boards...A good, dry soundboard has a certain &#x27;live&#x27; tone while a poor one will have a relatively dead response&quot;, which may be tested during construction by thumping the board and listening for, &quot;brighter, more noticeable ring[ing]&quot;, as one works the board, &quot;to the appropriate thinness&quot;.

Soundboards are traditionally made of wood (see tonewood), though other materials are used. Skin or plastic are found on instruments in the banjo family, and harpsichord makers have experimented with metal soundboards. Wooden soundboards, with the exclusion of those found on keyboard instruments, typically have one or more sound holes of various shapes. Round, oval, or F-holes appear on many plucked instruments, such as guitars and mandolins. F-holes are usual in violin family instruments. Lutes commonly have elaborate rosettes.

The soundboard, depending on the instrument, is called a &quot;soundboard&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, &quot;top plate&quot;, &quot;resonator&quot;, &quot;table&quot;, &quot;sound-table&quot;, or &quot;belly&quot;. It is usually made of a softwood, often spruce.

More generally, any hard surface can act as a soundboard. An example is when someone strikes a tuning fork and holds it against a table top to amplify its sound.

== Production and material ==
Wood for woodworking must be specially prepared. Ideally, it should be naturally dried. The natural drying process takes at least one year, but it is the only process that preserves the natural structure of the fibres and pores of the wood, which determine the resonance and frequency characteristics of the material. Not only is this process lengthy, but it is also expensive. It would be far quicker and cheaper to subject the wood to artificial drying, although the quality of the material would be compromised. The acoustic properties of an instrument are also influenced by the wood&#x27;s cutting profile, the direction of its fibres and the lack of knots.

<doc id="377457" wikidata="Q1368898" url="?curid=377457" title="Game of skill">
<text>A game of skill is a game where the outcome is determined mainly by mental or physical skill, rather than chance.
Alternatively, a game of chance is one where its outcome is strongly influenced by some randomizing device, such as dice, spinning tops, playing cards, roulette wheels, or numbered balls drawn from a container.

While a game of chance may have some skill element to it, chance generally plays a greater role in determining its outcome. A game of skill may also have elements of chance, but skill plays a greater role in determining its outcome.

Some commonly played games of skill and chance include: poker, collectible card games, contract bridge, backgammon and mahjong.

Most games of skill also involve a degree of chance, due to natural aspects of the environment, a randomizing device (such as dice, playing cards or a coin flip), or guessing due to incomplete information. For many games where skill is a component alongside chance, such as card games like poker but also some physical games, the skills needed to play the game well include the calculation of mathematical probabilities and the application of game theory. Game theory often leads to tactics such as bluffing and other forms of deception.

==Legal meaning==
The distinction between &quot;chance&quot; and &quot;skill&quot; has important legal implications in countries where games of chance are treated differently from games of skill. For instance, games of chance (such as lotteries) are often more heavily regulated by the state, if not prohibited altogether, in order to protect consumers from addiction issues. However, the legal distinction between games of skill and games of chance is often vague, and varies widely from one jurisdiction to the next.

In Germany, whether a game is considered of skill has legal implications with respect to whether wagers on the game&#x27;s outcome are considered gambling or not. For example, poker is legally considered a game of chance in Germany (thus only allowed in casinos), whereas a tournament of skat is considered a game of skill and competitions with money prizes are allowed. Alternatively, poker has been ruled by a United States federal judge as a game of skill rather than chance.

== Examples ==

== Games of skill requiring special equipment (selection) ==
* Air hockey
* Billiards
* Pinball machine
* Skee ball
* Snooker
* Table football
* Table ice hockey
* Whac-A-Mole

With the increasing spread of computer games, a lot of software of this genre was also created. Originally, these were mainly so-called jump&#x27;n&#x27;run games. However, the range has long since expanded and now also includes games with a greater strategic component, for example the various Tetris variants. In contrast to the non-virtual skill game, which usually involves the entire body, eye-hand coordination is required here. Encouraging player responsiveness and imagination is controversial. Nevertheless, various online skill games and jump&#x27;n&#x27;run adventures also find a place in child psychotherapeutic work.

<text>The 1985–1988 Rugby League World Cup (sometimes shortened to 1988 Rugby League World Cup) was the ninth edition of the Rugby League World Cup. Unlike previous World Cups that were held over a couple of months, this World Cup was held over the course of three years with teams playing each other on a home and away basis.

World Cup games were fitted into the normal international programme of three-match test series between the nations, with a pre-designated match from each series counting as the world cup fixture. The tournament culminated in the 1988 Rugby League World Cup final.

France were unable to fulfil their 1987 tour of Australasia due to financial difficulties, and had to forfeit away fixtures against Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, who were invited to participate for the first time.

At the end of four years, Australia finished top of the table, and, through a victory over Great Britain in Christchurch, the Kiwis qualified to join them in the final. Despite finishing top of the table, poor international attendances since the mid-1970s meant the Australians declined to host the final, and asked New Zealand Rugby League to host the World Cup final at Eden Park in Auckland; Cup organisers and New Zealand officials accepted this request.

In front of a record New Zealand attendance of over 47,000 the Kiwis lost 25–12 to the Australians.

This was the final Test match of the 1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France.

The victory lifted Great Britain above New Zealand into second place on the World Cup table on eight points – one ahead of the Kiwis.


This was the end of a 15-match winning streak for the Australians, and Great Britain&#x27;s first Test victory over the Kangaroos since their 18–14 win at Odsal during the 1978 Kangaroo tour, as well as their first win in Australia for 18 years. It also put Great Britain on top of the World Cup points table.


The last group stage match for both teams turned out to be a sudden death battle for a spot in the final. For New Zealand nothing less than a win would get them to the Final while Great Britain only needed a draw. It was also the last Test match of the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour. The Kiwis victory meant they qualified to face Australia in the final at Eden Park, Auckland.

Australia&#x27;s 62-point win set a new record for largest winning margin in international rugby league. Winger Michael O&#x27;Connor also set a new record for most points scored by an individual in international rugby league. The sellout crowd of 11,685 also set a ground attendance record at Wagga Wagga&#x27;s Eric Weissel Oval.

== Tournament standings ==
== World Cup final ==

The 1985–1988 Rugby League World Cup saw New Zealand play Australia in the World Cup final, the culmination of four years of competition. The Final was played at the spiritual home of rugby union in New Zealand, Auckland&#x27;s Eden Park. It was the first time that rugby league had been played at the ground since 1919. The final attracted the highest ever crowd for a rugby league match in New Zealand of 47,363 (only 672 less than had attended the 1987 Rugby World Cup final at the venue). Australia had won the right to host the final, but in the interests of promoting the game, and because attendances for internationals played in Australia had been dwindling for over a decade due to the Kangaroos dominance, the ARL agreed to move the game to New Zealand. Prior to kick-off Graham Brazier performed the New Zealand national anthem.

Despite Australia&#x27;s successful Ashes defence against Great Britain earlier in the year, the inexperience of the Australian World Cup final team (and because NZ had defeated Australia in their previous encounter in a one-off test in Brisbane in 1987), saw the hosts actually go into the match as favourites in the eyes of many critics. However, the Wally Lewis led Kangaroos, boasting veteran test players Garry Jack, Dale Shearer, Michael O&#x27;Connor, Steve Roach, Paul Dunn, Wayne Pearce, and Terry Lamb, along with 1986 Kangaroos Ben Elias and Paul Sironen, mixed with newer international players Mark McGaw, Allan Langer, Gavin Miller, Andrew Farrar and David Gillespie, triumphed over the ill-disciplined Kiwis, who at least made sure the victorious Australians were bloodied and bruised for their victory lap. For the Kiwis, the Iro brothers Tony and Kevin, Gary Freeman, Clayton Friend, Mark Graham, Adrian Shelford, Kurt Sorensen and captain Dean Bell dished out the punishment.

Despite Queensland having won the State of Origin series 3–0 over New South Wales earlier in the year, the Maroons only supplied three of Australia&#x27;s 15 players for the World Cup final. Captain Wally Lewis (who broke his right forearm in the 15th minute of the game while tackling Tony Iro), Dale Shearer and Allan Langer. Lewis later claimed that it was the same as had been the case since Origin started in 1980, Qld wins the series but it was mainly NSW players picked for Australia.

<text>Anatolian rock (), or Turkish psychedelic rock, is a fusion of Turkish folk music and rock. It emerged during the mid-1960s, soon after rock groups became popular in Turkey. The most widely known members of this genre include Turkish musicians Barış Manço, Cem Karaca, Erkin Koray, Selda Bağcan, Fikret Kızılok alongside bands such as Moğollar.

==History and development==

=== Background (1930s-1960s) ===
Anatolian rock has a long history that dates back to the founding of the Turkish Republic decades ago. Atatürk pushed extensive changes to build a national form of music from the early 1930s forward. He believed that music should be based on national and modern foundations and musicians should work on Turkish melodies and make them polyphonic according to the rules of Western harmonic music. As a result, Anatolian folk music began to spread and people began to listen to Anatolian folk tunes instead of Ottoman music.

In the 1960s, Rock and roll began to be played and rock groups such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Status Quo and Omega became popular especially in Istanbul. It began to spread and became popular among the elite youth of the city. In Istanbul, high school and university students began forming their own bands and performing covers of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll and twist music in 1957. Students who would become famous singers later, such as Barış Manço from Galatasaray High School and Erkin Koray from German High School, performed at an amateur concert they had organized, which is known as the first rock&#x27;n roll concert of Turkey. Turkish singers such as Erol Büyükburç began to release English-language cover versions of American songs, as well as their own songs.

=== Golden age of Anatolian rock and Turkish psychedelic rock (1960s-1980s) ===
From 1957, Turkish radio stations played surf rock by the Tornados and the Ventures, and films with Elvis Presley and Bill Haley were shown in Turkish cinemas. This inspired musicians like Erkin Koray to start already in 1957 with cover versions of rock’n’roll tunes, using the new electric guitar. By the early 1960s, Turkish groups began to perform instrumentals, such as those by the Shadows and the Ventures. Although often locally popular performers, these Turkish groups were rarely recorded. The first original Turkish-language pop song was &quot;Ayrılanlar İçin&quot;, released in 1964 by Timur Selçuk. Other singers also emerged, including Barış Manço, who first recorded in the early 1960s before later spearheading the growth of Turkish rock music in the 1970s with albums such as &quot;2023&quot; (1975) and become &quot;the father of Anatolian Rock&quot;. At the same time, Turkish society began to undergo significant cultural changes, including the growth of multi-party democracy.

The domestic rock music scene in Turkey expanded rapidly in the mid- and late 1960s. In 1963, guitarist Erkin Koray published &quot;One September Night&quot; (&quot;Bir Eylül Akşamı&quot;) which is regarded as the first rock&#x27;n roll song in the Turkish language and opened a new era, the Turkish psychedelic rock. From 1968 to about 1975, psychedelic rock became popular in Turkey, notably the work of Koray, regarded as a &quot;hugely influential figure on the Istanbul music scene&quot;. The band Moğollar are credited with &quot;changing the landscape of Turkish rock by incorporating elements of Anatolian folk music,&quot; and, after recording in France as Les Mogols, named their musical genre &quot;Anadolu Pop&quot;. Another pioneer, Fikret Kızılok, combined the style of &quot;Anadolu Pop&quot; with overtly political lyrics, and experiments with electronic music.

Turkish musicians also regularly performed at competitive European music festivals. In 1964, Tülay German performed the song &quot;Burçak Tarlası&quot; at the Balkan Music Festival, in a bossa nova style, and became immediately popular. As a direct result, the newspaper &quot;Hürriyet&quot; organized a &quot;Golden Microphone&quot; (&quot;Altın Mikrofon&quot;) competition, to encourage the development of new songs in Turkish blending folk tunes and Western style music. This helped identify a new generation of musicians, including the groups Mavi Işıklar, Silüetler, and musicians Cem Karaca, Edip Akbayram, Selçuk Alagöz, and his sister Rana Alagöz. Finalists were awarded with an opportunity to record a 45 rpm single, and a tour across the country. As a result, it caused people outside the big cities to be exposed to this genre.

=== The end of Anatolian rock era (1980) ===
Anatolian Rock remained popular until the late 1970s. During these times, some musicians took a stand in support of the common people. One such person was Selda Bağcan. For young people, popular music became synonymous with leftist thinking, protests for greater equality, freedom and worker&#x27;s rights. The left-wing views of these artists did not endear them to the authorities. As the 1970s went on, economic recession and social unrest arose across Turkey and on 12 September 1980, military coup brought the Anatolian rock genre to an end. Left-wing rockers faced repression, while the gloomy political atmosphere boosted the popularity of the melancholic Arabesque genre during the 80s.

After the coup, rock musicians were banned from performing, many artists had to flee abroad such as Cem Karaca and some were imprisoned.

=== Era of Turkish rock (After 1990s) ===
As other rock genres gained popularity in Turkey, Anatolian rock also began to diversify and the Turkish rock that came out of this period, was far from its traditional Anatolian-style roots and has no connection with folk music.

In later decades, there has been a growth of Turkish rock bands such as Duman, Mor ve Ötesi, Gece Yolcuları, Almora, Kurban, Kargo, Vega, Çilekeş, Redd, Gripin and maNga, the latter having won the &quot;Best Rock Band&quot; award in almost all polls in 2005. Besides, due to the Turkish migration to Germany, several Turkish-rooted bands also evolved in Germany. In the 1980s as alternative groups: (from 1981 on, at the beginning named Fahrstuhl) and the Trial (from 1985 on). The influences acting upon all these bands fall into a wide range of genres, from the Seattle Sound to heavy or doom metal and rapcore. Hence, Anatolian rock refers to a fusion of a wide selection of western rock subgenres with either a traditional Turkish sound or even rock music with Turkish lyrics. Such cultural fusion led the way for rock music to develop in Turkey.

By the end of the 1980s, several metal groups formed in Turkey such as Mezarkabul (Pentagram).
=== 2010s ===
In late 2010s, some rock musicians and bands appeared that harmonize folk tunes with rock, such as singer Gaye Su Akyol, and bands like Palmiyeler, Ayyuka, Makas, Dutch Anatolian rock band Altın Gün and UK based Anatolian rock band Kit Sebastian. In 2014, the Anatolian Rock Revival Project started with the vision of preserving the culture of Anatolian rock and transferring it to future generations. Nemrud blends the rich tradition of Anatolian rock with the complexity of Western progressive rock, creating a unique sound.

<doc id="377468" wikidata="Q955377" url="?curid=377468" title="Francesco Canova da Milano">
<text>Francesco Canova da Milano (Francesco da Milano, also known as &quot;Il divino&quot;, &quot;Francesco da Parigi&quot;, etc.) (18 August 1497 – 2 January 1543) was an Italian lutenist and composer. He was born in Monza, near Milan, and worked for the papal court for almost all of his career. Francesco was heralded throughout Europe as the foremost lute composer of his time. More of his music is preserved than of any other lutenist of the period, and his work continued to influence composers for more than a century after his death.

==Life==
Francesco da Milano was almost certainly born in Monza, a small city some 15 km north-northeast of Milan. His father Benedetto was a musician, as was his elder brother Bernardino. According to Luca Gaurico&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus astrologicus&quot; (1552), Francesco studied under Giovanni Angelo Testagrossa, but today this is considered somewhat unlikely. By 1514 Francesco was a member of the papal household in Rome. From that time for most of his career he was closely associated with the papal court. He and his father became private musicians to Pope Leo X in October 1516; Francesco&#x27;s father kept this position until December 1518, but Francesco stayed until Leo&#x27;s death in 1521. Little is known about his subsequent career in Rome, but he was still living in the city in early 1526: on 16 January 1526 he and one other lutenist performed for Pope Clement VII and Isabella d&#x27;Este.

Details of Francesco&#x27;s later life are sketchy. He may have served at the Parisian court for a short time, since some sources refer to him as &quot;Francesco da Parigi&quot;. In 1528 he obtained a canonry in S Nazaro Maggiore in Milan, which he would cede to his brother in 1536. He may have travelled to Murano in 1530. Between 1531 and 1535 he served Cardinal Ippolito de&#x27; Medici, who died in 1535. In the same year Francesco worked as lute teacher to Ottavio Farnese, grandson of Pope Paul III. In a document dated 1 January 1538 Francesco is listed as a member of the household of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, a famous patron of the arts. In July Francesco married one Clara Tizzoni, a Milanese noblewoman, and moved to Milan, where the couple lived at least until September. By early 1539 Francesco and his father were once again employed by the papal court.

Nothing is known about Francesco&#x27;s last years and his death, except that he probably did not die in Milan. The exact date of death, 2 January 1543, was recorded only by Luca Gaurico. Francesco&#x27;s brother outlived him by at least 19 years, and died sometime after 1562. Francesco&#x27;s father probably outlived his son as well; he died at some point before 1555.

==Works==
Already by 1530 Francesco&#x27;s music was widely known and studied. A few of his works were published in France by Pierre Attaingnant in 1529, five volumes of lute music comprising mostly Francesco&#x27;s works were published in Milan in 1536. There are many 16th- and 17th-century manuscript sources for his works, as well. Today, more than a hundred ricercars and fantasias (two terms used interchangeably in Francesco&#x27;s oeuvre), some 30 intabulations and a few other pieces by Francesco are known. His music represents the transition from the loose improvisational style of his predecessors to the more refined polyphonic textures of later lute music. One of the defining characteristic features of Francesco&#x27;s style is the manipulation and development of short melodic motifs within a &quot;narrative&quot; formal outline. Francesco was drawing on techniques found in contemporary vocal music, e.g. works by Josquin des Prez and composers of his generation. Aside from his influence on the development of lute music, he is also important for being among the first composers to create monothematic ricercars. Francesco&#x27;s reputation today rests on his ricercars and fantasias, but contemporaries apparently held his intabulations of vocal works by other composers to be the best part of his œuvre.

The collected extant lute music of Francesco, edited by Arthur Ness, was published by Harvard University Press in 1970 (). As such, the organizing number, akin to the Opus number and other such devices, is &quot;Ness&quot;.

==&quot;Canzona&quot;==
A composition called &quot;Canzona by Francesco da Milano&quot; (better known as the song &quot;The City of Gold&quot;) is commonly misattributed to da Milano. It is actually a musical hoax by lutenist and famous mystificator Vladimir Vavilov, who composed this tune and credited it to Francesco da Milano. After being released by rock band Aquarium in 1987, the song became a big hit in the Soviet Union and beyond and raised questions about the actual credit. It was not until the 2000s that mystification was revealed and the credit for the hit went posthumously to Vavilov.

<text>The 1989–1992 Rugby League World Cup (sometimes shortened to 1992 Rugby League World Cup) was the tenth staging of the Rugby League World Cup, and continued to use the three-year format, stretching across the years 1989 to 1992. As with the 1985–1988 World Cup, teams played each other on a home-and-away basis. These matches were fitted into the normal international programme of three-match test series between the nations, with a pre-designated match from each series counting as the World Cup fixture. The tournament culminated in the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup final]].

The matches went strictly to form, with Australia undefeated and certain to claim a world cup final berth as early as 1991. France and Papua New Guinea were uncompetitive, leading to a straight fight between New Zealand and Great Britain for the right to meet the Kangaroos in the final. In the event the Lions were able to just edge out the Kiwis on points difference.

As they had done in 1988, Australia had won the right to host the World Cup final. However, with the potential for a much larger attendance, the Australian Rugby League agreed to allow Great Britain to host the game at the 82,000 capacity Wembley Stadium in London. The final was a surprisingly close affair, with Great Britain leading with only 12 minutes to go. The game&#x27;s only try was then scored by centre Steve Renouf in his international debut for the Kangaroos and Australia were able to claim their fourth consecutive World Cup title before a world record international rugby league attendance of 73,631.

====1989====
The first match of the 1989–1992 World Cup was also the 3rd test of the 1989 Trans-Tasman Test series which was won 3–0 by Australia

====1990====



This match was also the 3rd and deciding test of the 1990 Ashes series.

====1991====



This match was also the 3rd and deciding test of the 1991 Trans-Tasman series.

====1992====

In addition to being an allocated World Cup match, this was the third, deciding test of the 1992 Ashes series. This six-point margin of defeat meant that New Zealand would need to beat Papua New Guinea by 109 points in the following match to prevent a Great Britain-Australia World Cup final in October.

===Final===



This match set a new world record attendance for a rugby league international of 73,631, beating the previous record of 70,204 set at the Sydney Cricket Ground during the 1932 Ashes series. As they had done in 1988, Australia won the right to host the World Cup final. However, in the interests of rugby league, and the potential for a much larger attendance since at the time Lang Park in Brisbane could only hold 33,000, and the Sydney Football Stadium could only seat 42,000, the ARL agreed to Great Britain hosting the final at the 82,000 capacity Wembley.

Unlike 1988 when Australia had agreed to let New Zealand host the Final at Eden Park in Auckland due to dwindling international attendances in Australia, the international game had become popular again over the next four years (mainly due to much improved performances by Great Britain and New Zealand) and there was a good chance of sell-out crowd in either Brisbane or Sydney for the game. However, the potential for an attendance at Wembley that would be almost or more than double the size that could be seen in Australia, and the potential exposure from playing the game at one of the world&#x27;s most iconic stadiums, could not be ignored.

Both coaches picked experienced teams, with only Australian&#x27;s Tim Brasher (fullback) and Steve Renouf (centre) making their international debut in the game. With incumbent fullback Andrew Ettingshausen unavailable through injury, Australian coach Bob Fulton preferred utility outside back Brasher over Newcastle Knights fullback Brad Godden due to Brasher&#x27;s previous big game experience having played in Balmain&#x27;s 1989 Grand Final loss as well as making his State of Origin debut earlier in the year. Fulton also chose seven members from the Brisbane Broncos 1992 Winfield Cup premiership winning team including exciting centre Renouf. Lions coach Mal Reilly chose to retain Garry Schofield as captain despite the presence of Ellery Hanley in the team. He also went with pace on the wings with Martin Offiah and St. Helens flyer Alan Hunte.

The hard-fought final was a one-try affair, with Great Britain leading 6–4 with only 12 minutes remaining. The only try of the match was then set up by Australian replacement back Kevin Walters, who, with a clever cut-out pass, put his Broncos teammate Steve Renouf into a gap not covered by replacement Lions centre John Devereux. Renouf, in his debut test for Australia, then raced 20 metres to score in the corner. Otherwise, the two teams&#x27; kickers (Mal Meninga and Deryck Fox) were called upon to score most of the points, including Meninga&#x27;s pressure sideline conversion of Renouf&#x27;s try. The rain started pouring in the second half and Australia was able to hold Great Britain out and maintain their lead until the final siren.

Australia&#x27;s triumph saw them win their fourth World Cup in a row after winning the previous cups in 1975, 1977 and 1988. It also ended a mini-hoodoo for the Kangaroos at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium. Australia had previously left the arena 21–12 losers in 1973, and the 1990 Kangaroos were outplayed by Great Britain 19–12, but when it mattered most this time around Australia proved themselves as worthy World Cup champions.

The match was telecast live late at night throughout Australia on the Nine Network, with commentary provided by Ray Warren, Peter Sterling and Paul Vautin, with sideline comments from Chris Bombolas. The game broke Australia&#x27;s midnight-to-dawn television ratings record which was set a year earlier by the rugby union&#x27;s 1991 Rugby World Cup final.
