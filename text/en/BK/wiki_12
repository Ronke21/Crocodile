<text>South Park is a broad post-World War II development in the south-central area of Houston, Texas, a few miles south of MacGregor Park and directly south of the 610 Loop. According to the 2000 Census, the community has a population of 22,282. 81% of the South Park population is African American, compared to 25% for the city as a whole. Houston&#x27;s Martin Luther King Boulevard (formerly South Park Boulevard) runs through the area. Reflecting its postwar origins, many streets in South Park are named after World War II battle sites and persons. In the 1980s and 1990s crime became a key issue for South Park. Katharine Shilcutt of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said &quot;South Park is an overgrown garden these days, its soil only able to be tilled by the most determined or the most desperate. It shows no sign that it will grow again any time in the near future.&quot;

==History==
South Park, a post-World War II development, had mostly middle class White American families during the 1950s and early 1960s. Many of the homebuyers were veterans of World War II, and streets were named after battles and people that the homebuyers knew from personal experience. When South Park served as a suburb, lawns were neatly trimmed and area children traveled to places by bicycle.

The 610 Loop opened in the 1960s. Katharine Shilcutt of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; stated that some residents believed that the opening of 610 marked the beginning of South Park&#x27;s decline. Ralph Gonzales, a former resident quoted by Shilcutt, said that the opening of 610 caused traffic to increase in the area and allowed residents of other sections of the city to more easily reach South Park.

Shilcutt added that the forced integration of Jones High School and nearby Sterling High School hastened demographic changes; White families began to move to newer suburbs, such as Pasadena and Pearland. Dave Straughan, a former sergeant of the Houston Police Department&#x27;s robbery division who served his rookie beat in South Park, said that several factors caused South Park to decline as a neighborhood; by the 1970s crime was beginning to increase.

In 1977 the Houston City Council voted to honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by renaming South Park Boulevard, a major area thoroughfare, to Martin Luther King Boulevard. The renaming was effective on April 5, 1978.

Shilcutt said that South Park was no longer considered a suburb by the late 1980s, and that crime became a major concern. In 1987 South Park was still considered to be a mixed race neighborhood.

Schilcutt said that when the White population in South Park became insignificant in the 1990s, the City of Houston government began to ignore the remaining residents. By 1993 the infrastructure of the neighborhood had severely declined, with the sewer and water lines beginning to rust and buckle. Al Calloway, a member of the Houston City Council proposed spending a $57.5 million cash surplus on improving the sewer and water lines of South Park; Calloway said &quot;residents in neighborhoods such as South Park or Sunnyside may die before the projects are done.&quot; The City of Houston never spent the surplus.

In October 1994 of rain fell in one day, causing flooding that caused the displacement of over 10,000 people in Greater Houston. The Sims Bayou overfilled, flooding businesses and houses in South Park. Few of the residents had flood insurance. Some businesses and houses were abandoned as a result of the flood.

As time passed, Hispanic residents moved into South Park, as part of a trend of Hispanics in the Houston area moving into black majority neighborhoods. Between 1990 and 2000, the Hispanic population of South Park increased by between 5 and 10 percent. In the same period, the black population of both South Park and Sunnyside declined by 4,225, or 11% as majority African-American neighborhoods in Houston had declines in their black populations. In 2000 82% of the neighborhood was Black, and 16% of the area population was Hispanic. In 2005 Lori Rodriguez of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that South Park was among a group of mostly African American neighborhoods that could become as much as 25% Hispanic and Latino by the end of the decade of the 2000s. In 2009 almost 20% of the neighborhood was Hispanic. As of the 2010 census South Park does not have any White residents. In 2011 the projected percentages for 2016 were 81% Black and 22% Hispanic.

In 2007 South Park was one of several Houston neighborhoods with a high concentration of felons.

As of 2011 the median yearly income is $33,196, a 15% decrease from 2000&#x27;s number. As of the same year the median housing price is $50,400, a 15% increase from 2000&#x27;s number. In a 10-year span ending in 2011, the foreign-born population of South Park increased by almost 10%.

==Demographics==
The City of Houston-defined South Park Super Neighborhood had 21,208 people in 2015. 67% were non-Hispanic black, 31% were Hispanic, 1% were non-Hispanic white, and 2% were non-Hispanic others. The percentage of non-Hispanic Asians was zero. In 2000 the super neighborhood had 22,282 people. 81% were non-Hispanic black, 16% were Hispanic, and 1% each were non-Hispanic white and other. The percentage of non-Hispanic Asians was zero.

==Cityscape==
The South Park subdivision has four sections. Section 1 is bounded by Calhoun Road, a line south of Pershing Boulevard, a line east of St. Lo Road, and a line north of Doolittle Road.
One part of Sections 2-4 is bounded by the 610 Loop, a line south and west of Burma Road, a line south of St. Lo Road, and a line east of Kassarine Pass. Another portion of Sections 2-4 is bound by Calhoun, 18th, Jutland, and a line north of Southwind Avenue. Another portion is wedged between St. Lo and Martin Luther King Boulevard (formerly named South Park Boulevard).

The wider South Park area is bounded by the 610 Loop, Cullen Boulevard, the Sims Bayou, and Mykawa Road.

Several small and well-maintained houses share the area with mostly deteriorating properties and vacant lots. By 2000 many houses adjacent to MLK Boulevard became converted to house commercial usage. In 2005 Lori Rodriguez of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that South Park had several abandoned businesses. As of 2011 trash is present in some front yards in South Park. As of 2011 the median yearly income is $33,196, a 15% decrease from 2000&#x27;s number. As of the same year the median housing price is $50,400, a 15% increase from 2000&#x27;s number. As of 2011 the most expensive house in South Park listed on HAR.com, a Houston real estate website, was a remodeled 1955 three bedroom house listed for less than $78,000; by January 12 of the year, the house&#x27;s price was reduced in order to attract potential homeowners. Katharine Shilcutt of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said that &quot;abandoned businesses, junked-out cars and empty houses crest the landscape&quot; of Martin Luther King Boulevard.

The housing in South Park includes many small two bedroom houses. Most of them have cedar shank siding, while more expensive houses have aluminum siding. When South Park was newly built, hamburger stands were located throughout the neighborhood including one that offered &quot;secret sauce&quot;. Other major features included Palm Center, a shopping center, and King Center Twin Drive-In, a two screen movie theater, which was open from 1952 to 1981. The area also had family-owned businesses and Boy Scout troops. Very few liquor stores or pawn shops were present. Shilcutt said that the schools,churches and the Scout troops,reflected &quot;the rock solid nature of the residents.&quot;

Many of the streets are named after World War II military events, such as Bataan, Dunkirk, Iwo Jima, and Kassarine Pass. One name, Remagen, was misspelled as &quot;Remagan&quot; on the Houston street name. Tony Gelat, an engineer, made attempts to make the city government change the name. As of 1997 they have not been successful.

==Crime==
Katharine Shilcutt of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said &quot;South Park became the stuff of legend as it almost cannibalized itself in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s with violent robberies and drive-by shootings.&quot;

Crime was not originally a factor in South Park. Dave Straughan, a former sergeant of the Houston Police Department&#x27;s robbery division who served his rookie beat in South Park, said that several factors caused South Park to decline as a neighborhood, with the decline beginning in 1971. Straughn stated that many Whites were very fearful of racial integration, so they very quickly left the neighborhood when African Americans moved in. The neighborhood began to receive residents who were poorer than the ones they replaced. The houses began to age and required increasing maintenance, of which the newer low-income residents generally would not be able to afford. Straughn also cited South Park&#x27;s proximity to Telephone Road, which he said &quot;had a national reputation for being pretty wild.&quot;

Shilcutt said that, by the late 1980s, South Park &quot;was dominated by drive-by shootings and drug dealers, especially along Burger Park&#x27;s street: Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.&quot; Shilcutt said that many South Park residents did not attend the area&#x27;s Neighborhood Nights Out as they were too afraid to leave their homes. Shilcutt added that &quot;Violence pervaded the entire community. Deaths grew increasingly random and senseless.&quot; Ralph Gonzales, a former resident quoted by Shilcutt, said &quot;In the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, it was bad. HPD was chasing guys up and down Bellfort and MLK. Folks were knocking over liquor stores, hijacking people.&quot;

Between January 1990 and December 1991 16 people had been killed along MLK Boulevard. Chuck Philips of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said in 1993 that South Park was &quot;a tough Houston ghetto dominated by drug-dealing, prostitution and gang warfare-where automatic rifles can be purchased almost as easily as rap cassettes.&quot; In 1993 Ronald Ray Howard, a convicted killer and drug dealer, said, in the words of &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; reporter Roy Bragg, that South Park was &quot;a war zone, a place of nightly shootings, fistfights, police harassment and strife. There, the right amount of money could buy any weapon, even hand grenades. Seven-year-old children knew how to handle pistols.&quot;

Gonzales said that the South Park criminal element imploded because the criminals depleted the wealth that was left in the neighborhood. According to Gonzales, the criminals moved to Alief and the Hiram Clarke area. In 2011 Gonzales said &quot;Pickins is slim&quot; in South Park. In 2005 Lori Rodriguez of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that South Park had an obvious drug dealer presence.

==Culture==
A ten block section of Martin Luther King Boulevard/South Park Boulevard, since the 1970s and by 2001, became a cruising scene, with cruising habitually occurring on Sunday evenings. On Sunday nights, within a three to four hour periods, speeds of automobiles were at 15 to 20 miles per hour, with about 2,000 to 4,000 people traveling through the ten blocks. Friends socialized and rap music played in the area. Most of the participants were black youth.

In 2001 police officers attempted to stifle the scene by flooding the 10 block stretch with water. The police said that businesses had wanted the crowds to be dissipated. After black activists protested, C. O. Bradford, the chief of the Houston Police Department, apologized. The following weekend, the cruising scene had reappeared. Thirty-two police officers were on the street, and traffic cones and barricades manipulated the vehicle traffic. Peggy O&#x27;Hare of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said &quot;It worked reasonably well, taking only five minutes to travel the 10-block area with restricted lane use.&quot; Because some police patrols appeared, some activists argued that the police were discriminating against African-American people and not giving proportionate attention to white partygoers in the Richmond Strip. Lt. S.K. Boyce. of the Houston Police Department stated that they made more arrests in the Richmond Strip than on MLK Boulevard, and most of those arrested were White. Quanell X said that he supported the police using a different crowd control tactics on MLK Boulevard. Some business owners supported the cruising scene, while some opposed the scene.

==Education==
As of 2011 55% of South Park&#x27;s residents have graduated from high school. Katharine Shilcutt said that the low rate is explained by an increasing number of immigrants and the &quot;disappointing graduation rates&quot; at Jones High School and Sterling High School.

===Elementary schools, Middle schools, and High schools===

===Public schools===
Original owners of the property which is now known as Candy Stripe Academy were Frank and Joyce Gonzales. The original structure has been demolished and the new building now faces Martin Luther King Blvd (Formally Southpark Blvd). 

South Park children are zoned to schools in the Houston Independent School District. The community is within Trustee District IV, represented by Paula M. Harris as of 2008.

Elementary schools serving sections of South Park include Alcott, Bastian, and Kelso. All residents of the South Park subdivision are zoned to Attucks Middle School. Residents east of Martin Luther King Boulevard are zoned to Sterling High School while other residents are zoned to Worthing High School. The Jones Futures Academy, formerly Jones High School, is an alternative secondary school in South Park.

Sterling, Worthing, and Jones serve the larger South Park area. In 2007 a study determined that 60% of the entering first year classes at Jones and Sterling advanced to their fourth year, and a portion of those students graduated. Because of this, the Associated Press and Johns Hopkins University labeled Jones and Sterling &quot;dropout factories.&quot; The study stated that over half of the high school students zoned to Jones and Worthing instead chose to attend other HISD schools.

Kandy Stripe Academy, an early education to 8th grade HISD-affiliated charter school, is in the subdivision. Jesse Jackson Academy, a state charter school, is located north of South Park, inside the 610 Loop.

On Thursday March 13, 2014, the HISD board voted 6-3 to keep the Jones campus open and convert it into an alternative career readiness school for students throughout HISD. At that time Jones was no longer be a zoned school, and its athletics programs were discontinued. Residents east of Martin Luther King Boulevard were rezoned to Sterling, and residents west of MLK were rezoned to Worthing, both for the 2014-2015 school year.

====Private schools====
A Kindergarten through 5 Roman Catholic school called St. Philip Neri School, of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, was in the area. It closed Spring 2009. The school was consolidated with St. Peter the Apostle Middle School.

===Public libraries===
The area is served by the Young Neighborhood Library of the Houston Public Library, which is located north of 610 in Palm Center.

==Government and infrastructure==
South Park is in Houston City Council District D.

Houston Fire Department operates Fire Station 35 South Park, a part of Fire District 46. The station was originally built at Holmes at South Park. The station had to move due to the construction of Interstate 610. The current station near Martin Luther King Boulevard and Van Fleet opened in 1965.

The neighborhood is within the Houston Police Department&#x27;s Southeast Patrol Division, headquartered at 8300 Mykawa.

<doc id="376680" wikidata="Q2484094" url="?curid=376680" title="William Dowdeswell (politician, born 1721)">
<text>William Dowdeswell PC (12 March 17216 February 1775) was a British politician who was a leader of the Rockingham Whig faction.

==Background and education==
A son of William Dowdeswell of Pull Court, Bushley, Worcestershire, he was educated at Westminster School, at Christ Church, Oxford, then at the University of Leiden.
One of his fellow students was Baron d&#x27;Holbach. He spent the summer of 1746 with him at the Heeze-Leende estate of his uncle, Messire François-Adam, Baron d&#x27;Holbach, Seigneur de Heeze, Leende et autres Lieux (ca. 1675–1753).

==Political career==
Dowdeswell became member of Parliament for the family borough of Tewkesbury in 1747, retaining this seat until 1754, and from 1761 until his death he was one of the representatives of Worcestershire. Becoming prominent among the Whigs, Dowdeswell was made Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1765 under the Marquess of Rockingham, and his short tenure of this position appears to have been a successful one, he being in Lecky&#x27;s words a good financier, but nothing more.

To general astonishment, he refused to abandon his friends and to take office under Chatham, who succeeded Rockingham in August 1766. Dowdeswell then led the Rockingham party in the House of Commons, taking an active part in debate until his death.

In 1774 during the Parliamentary debate of the Boston Port Act he warned the act will &quot;soon inflame all America, and stir up a contention you will not be able to pacify and quiet&quot;.

==Family and death==
Dowdeswell married Bridget, daughter of Sir William Codrington, 1st Baronet, in 1747. The couple are believed to have had as many as 15 children, including Charles William Dowdeswell (b. 8 June 1756). 

Dowdeswell went abroad to recover his health in 1774 but died the next February in Nice. The highly eulogistic epitaph on his monument at Bushley was written by Edmund Burke.

<doc id="376691" wikidata="Q2625304" url="?curid=376691" title="The Swan (theatre)">
<text>The Swan was a theatre in Southwark, London, England, built in 1595 on top of a previously standing structure, during the first half of William Shakespeare&#x27;s career. It was the fifth in the series of large public playhouses of London, after James Burbage&#x27;s The Theatre (1576) and Curtain (1577), the Newington Butts Theatre (between 1575 and 1577) and Philip Henslowe&#x27;s Rose (1587–88).

The Swan Theatre was located in the manor of Paris Gardens, on the west end of the Bankside district of Southwark, across the Thames River from the City of London. It was at the northeast corner of the Paris Garden estate nearest to London Bridge that Francis Langley had purchased in May 1589 at a distance of four hundred and twenty-six feet from the river&#x27;s edge. Playgoers could arrive also by water landing at the Paris Garden Stairs or the Falcon Stairs, both short walking distances from the theatre. The structure originally belonged to the Monastery of Bermondsey. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, it became royal property and passed through several hands before being sold to Langley for £850. The Mayor of London opposed Langley&#x27;s permit to open a theatre, but his protests held no ground as the property had formerly belonged to the crown and the Mayor had no jurisdiction.

Langley had the theatre built almost certainly in 1595–96. When it was new, the Swan was the most visually impressive of the existing London theatres. Johannes De Witt, a Dutchman who visited London around 1596, left a description of the Swan in a manuscript titled &quot;Observationes Londiniensis&quot;, now lost. Translated from the Latin, his description identifies the Swan as the &quot;finest and biggest of the London amphitheatres&quot;, with a capacity for 3000 spectators. From 1993-1996 the Globe theatre was reconstructed according to de Witt&#x27;s sketches. From this led to the previous believe concerning the theatre&#x27;s capacity to be reanalysed and it was found that it only had seating for 1000 spectators and additional space for 500 groundlings in the pit. It was built of flint concrete, and its wooden supporting columns were so cleverly painted that &quot;they would deceive the most acute observer into thinking that they were marble&quot;, giving the Swan a &quot;Roman&quot; appearance. (De Witt also drew a sketch of the theatre. The original is lost, but a copy by Arendt van Buchell survives, and is the only sketch of an Elizabethan playhouse known to exist. If the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men acted at the Swan in the summer of 1596—which is possible, though far from certain—( they toured in the provinces in July and August 1596 under the name of Lord Hunsdon&#x27;s Players) they would be the actors shown in the Swan sketch.) When Henslowe built the new Hope Theatre in 1613, he had his carpenter copy the Swan, rather than his own original theatre, the Rose, which must have appeared dated and out of style in comparison.

In 1597, the Swan housed the acting company Pembroke&#x27;s Men, with Actors Richard Jones, Thomas Downtown, and William Bird. (They later approached Henslowe to rejoin the Admiral&#x27;s Men at The Rose). Edward Alleyn They joined the Pembroke troupe after leaving their positions in Lord Admiral&#x27;s Men at the rival playhouse The Rose. In 1597 Pembroke&#x27;s Men staged the infamous play &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot;, by Thomas Nashe and Ben Jonson, the content of which gave offence, most likely for its &quot;satirical&quot; nature on the attack of some people high in authority. Jonson was imprisoned, along with Gabriel Spenser, an actor in the play, and Robert Shaa. Langley, already in trouble with the Privy Council over matters unrelated to theatre, may have exacerbated his danger by allowing his company to stage the play after a royal order that all playing stop and all theatres be demolished. This order of the Privy Council called for all London Theatres to be &quot;plucked down&quot;, but may have arisen because of Langley and the &#x27;seditious, lewd play&#x27;. The other companies were under inhibition to stop playing. The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men went on tour to six areas of the south east and south west, and the Admiral&#x27;s Men did not perform again at The Rose until the inhibition was lifted at the end of October. Johnson was released from jail on October 3. Nashe however went on the run. All but the Swan Theatre were granted licences to perform. The Swan continued to operate without a licence until 19 February 1598, when the two licensed companies called attention to them. Following the scandal, the Swan only held sporadic performances. Another scandal rocked the Swan in 1602, when Richard Vennar advertised a new play, &quot;England&#x27;s Joy&quot;, to be performed at the Swan on 6 November. Vennar claimed the play was a fantastical story in honour of Queen Elizabeth, and seats sold out quickly. However, the play was never performed. The townspeople were enraged and vandalised the theatre, and the theatre never seemed to recover its former popularity.

Because both court and city were interested in limiting the number of acting troupes in London, and because there was, consequently, a glut of large open-roof venues in the city, the Swan was only intermittently home to drama. Along with &quot;The Isle of Dogs&quot;, the most famous play to premiere there was Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Chaste Maid in Cheapside&quot;, performed by the newly merged Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s Men in 1613. The theatre offered other popular entertainments, such as swashbuckling competitions and bear-baiting.

For the next eight years, the building was used occasionally for special entertainment. After 1615 the Swan was deserted for five years, but used again in 1621 by some actors who are unknown. They did not stay for long.

The building grew decrepit over the next two decades. In Nicholas Goodman&#x27;s 1632 pamphlet &quot;Holland&#x27;s Leaguer&quot;, the theatre is described as &quot;now fallen into decay, and, like a dying swan, hangs her head and sings her own dirge.&quot; Historical sources do not mention the Swan after that date.

<text>Silbo Gomero ( , &quot;Gomeran whistle&quot;), also known as el silbo (&quot;the whistle&quot;), is a whistled register of Spanish that is used by inhabitants of La Gomera, in the Canary Islands. It was historically used to communicate across the deep ravines and narrow valleys that radiate through the island and enabled messages to be exchanged over a distance of up to five kilometres. Its loudness causes Silbo Gomero to be generally used for public communication. Messages that are conveyed range from event invitations to public information advisories. A speaker of Silbo Gomero is sometimes called a &quot;silbador&quot; (&quot;whistler&quot;).

Silbo Gomero is a transposition of Spanish from speech to whistling. The oral phoneme-whistled phoneme substitution emulates Spanish phonology through a reduced set of whistled phonemes. In 2009, UNESCO declared it a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

==History==

Little is known of the original Guanche language or the languages of the Canary Islands, but it is assumed that their phonological system must have been simple enough to allow an efficient whistled language. It was used by the island&#x27;s original inhabitants, the Guanches. The whistled language existed before the arrival of Spanish settlers and was also spoken on El Hierro, Tenerife and Gran Canaria. Silbo was adapted to Spanish during the Spanish settlement in the 16th century and was widely spoken throughout into the 17th century. In 1976, Silbo barely remained on El Hierro, where it had flourished at the end of the 19th century. Use of the language declined in the 1950s, one factor being the economic decline, which led many speakers to move away to seek better jobs. Technological developments such as the telephone played a part in reducing the practicality and utility of the language. The language&#x27;s earlier survival had been caused by its role in overcoming distance and terrain, in addition to the ease with which it is learned by native speakers. Most significantly, from the 1960s to 1980s, many people turned away from agriculture and so many middle-class families did not want their children to speak the language, as it was negatively associated with the rural peasants.

In the late 1990s, language revitalization efforts began, and initiatives from within the community started. By 1999, the revitalization of Silbo Gomero was furthered by education policies and other legislative measures. It now has official protection as an example of intangible cultural heritage.

==Speakers==
Many people in La Gomera speak Silbo Gomero, but their expression of the language deviates in minor ways that show the speaker&#x27;s origins. According to a 2009 UNESCO report, all of La Gomera&#x27;s inhabitants understand the language, but only those born before 1950 and the younger generations who attended school since 1999 can speak it. Those born before 1950 were taught the language by their elders in their homes, and those who attended or are attending school since 1999 were taught it formally in school. Those born between 1950 and 1980 understand the language but are unable to speak it, as it was hardly used and negatively viewed during their time of language acquisition.

==Revitalization==
When this medium of communication was endangered in the late 20th century, revitalization efforts were generated at both community level and governmental level. A combination of initiatives from the La Gomeran community and policies implemented by the authorities saw Silbo Gomero being revitalized and maintained as a cultural asset. These revitalization efforts were well-documented by UNESCO as part of the proceedings for the selection of the 2009 Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

===Community initiatives===
In a bid to preserve Silbo Gomero for the island&#x27;s youth, expert whistlers sought to obtain permission to teach the language on a free and voluntary basis at a dedicated centre. The initiative by the senior islanders garnered encouraging responses, with parent-teacher associations extending it to all schools. The first of many revitalization measures was thus adopted at the grassroots level not by public or private entities, which reflected the locals&#x27; attitude toward Silbo Gomero. Education policies implemented later were inspired as such, and revitalization began at the grassroots and escalated to the highest government bodies.

===Government policies===
On 26 June 1997, the Parliament of the Canary Islands approved a motion calling on the government to include Silbo Gomero as part of the school curriculum. Silbo Gomero then became a mandatory subject in primary and secondary education, as of July 1999. The provincial government was supportive in its implementation of education policy and also the establishment of a formalized Silbo Gomero curriculum through the publication of &quot;El Silbo Gomero, Materiales didácticos&quot; (&quot;Educational Materials on the Silbo Gomero&quot;).

In addition to the compulsory learning of Silbo Gomero at the primary and secondary level, an Island School of Silbo Gomero was established for post-secondary students who wish to continue to train in Silbo Gomero until they become accredited professional instructors. Students of the Island School work to become capable of teaching Silbo Gomero not only to their fellow citizens, but also to tourists who visit La Gomera. This facilitates the sustainability of the revitalization and also works towards language maintenance.

Thereafter, the Ministry of Education, Universities, Culture and Sport of the Canary Islands developed a staff training plan in order to ensure that the elderly expert whistlers can be replaced in the near future by qualified professional teachers with relevant diplomas. This comprised the provision of training courses on proficiency in and the teaching of Silbo Gomero. The training plan was launched in 2007, with the participation of 18 teachers.

Besides the implementation of education policies, the authorities also sought to strengthen the corpus of Silbo Gomero by developing a project to digitize all recorded audio material. Local, national and worldwide distribution of documentaries on Silbo Gomero were also made. The government also raised the status of Silbo Gomero by selecting it via the National Historical Heritage Council to represent Spain in the nominations for inclusion on the 2009 Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

===Cultural heritage===
Members of the Gomeran community treasure Silbo Gomero as part of the island&#x27;s identity and use the whistled language in traditional rituals and festivities on the island such as &quot;bajadas&quot;, processions that are dedicated to the Virgin or the patron saints of the community.

On 15 March 1999, Silbo Gomero was declared as part of the historical ethnographic heritage of the Canary Islands. The annual celebration of &quot;School Encounters with Silbo Gomero&quot; was also inaugurated in La Gomera. In 2005, the monument to Silbo Gomero was inducted in Garajonay National Park.

===Tourism===
 Silbo Gomero is not used only by Gomerans since visitors to the island can be exposed to it in restaurants that provide demonstrations for tourists. La Gomera&#x27;s minister of tourism, Fernando Mendez, said that whistling is essential to La Gomera&#x27;s tourism industry.

==Features==

According to different studies, Silbo Gomero has between two and four vowels and between four and ten consonants. It is a whistled form of a dialect of Canarian Spanish. Silbo replaces each vowel or consonant with a whistling sound. Whistles are distinguished according to pitch and continuity. As with other whistled forms of non-tonal languages, Silbo works by retaining approximately the articulation of ordinary speech and so &quot;the timbre variations of speech appear in the guise of pitch variations&quot;.

Silbo Gomero is a complex language to learn, with its whistling techniques requiring physical precision and a strength of the body parts producing the language that can be acquired only by practice. Silbo Gomero uses the tongue, lips and hands and so differs greatly from conventional language, which uses the mouth cavity to blend and contrast several acoustic frequencies. The whistling mechanism, in contrast, is limited to a single basic pitch between 1,000 and 3,000 hertz. The physical precision comes in the whistler&#x27;s ability to vary the frequencies at different speeds and start and stop the production of the sound waves. The technique is handed down within La Gomera&#x27;s community, with unchanged teaching methods that date to the late 19th century. Since the same pitch can represent many sounds, Silbo has many fewer phonemes than Spanish. Therefore, communication can be ambiguous; context and word choice are important for effective communication.

===Vowels===
Silbo Gomero&#x27;s vowels are described roughly as sustained lines of high and low frequencies, which are distinct from each other. 

The high-frequency represents the vowels of the spoken language being whistled, and the low-frequency whistle of represents the vowels . It is said that it is not possible to produce any vowels with intermediary frequencies because the whistling mechanism does not have the same functions as the vocal mechanism. In 1978, Ramón Trujillo of the University of La Laguna theorized that Silbo Gomero has only two vowels. His work, containing almost 100 spectrograms, concludes that the language has two vowels and four consonants. In Trujillo&#x27;s work, Silbo&#x27;s vowels are given one quality, that of pitch, either high or low.

However, a more recent study gives a statistical analysis of Silbo&#x27;s vowels showing that four vowels are statistically distinguished in production and perception. In 2005, Annie Rialland of the University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle published an acoustic and phonological analysis of Silbo based on new materials that showed that not only gliding tones but also intensity modulation plays a role in distinguishing Silbo&#x27;s sounds.

Trujillo&#x27;s 2005 collaboration with the Gomeran whistler Isidro Ortiz and others revised his earlier work, found that four vowels are indeed perceived and described in detail the areas of divergence between his empirical data and Classe&#x27;s phonetic hypotheses. Despite Trujillo&#x27;s 2005 work acknowledging the existence of four vowels, his 2006 bilingual work &quot;El Silbo Gomero. Nuevo estudio fonológico&quot; inexplicably reiterated his two-vowel theory. Trujillo&#x27;s 2006 work directly addressed many of Rialland&#x27;s conclusions, but it seems that at the time of that writing, he was unaware of Meyer&#x27;s work.

Meyer suggests that there are four vowel classes: , , , . However, Meyer also states there are five perceived vowels with significant overlap. Rialland and Trujillo agree that the harmonic of the whistle matches the second formant of the spoken vowels. Spoken &#x27;s F2 and whistled &#x27;s H1 match in their frequency (1480 Hz). However, there is a disconnect in harmonics and formants near the frequency basement. Spoken speech has a wide range of F2 frequencies (790 Hz to 2300 Hz), but whistles are limited to between . That cayses vowels to be shifted upward at the lower end (maintaining 1480 Hz as ), increasing confusion between (spoken F2 frequency 890 Hz, whistled &lt;1300 Hz) and (spoken frequency 790 Hz, whistled «1300 Hz). In whistling, the frequency basement must be raised to the minimum whistle harmonic of 1000 Hz, frequency spacing in the vowels, which increases misidentification of the lower vowels.

===Consonants===
Silbo Gomero&#x27;s consonants are modifications of the vowel-based &quot;melody line&quot; or &quot;vocal line&quot;. They can rise or fall and be modified by being broken, continuous or occlusive. The four main consonants in a 1978 analysis are listed as follows:
The documentation on the official Silbo Gomero page on the UNESCO website is in line with Trujillo&#x27;s 1978 study. He suggested that consonants are either rises or dips in the &quot;melody line&quot; that can be broken or continuous. Further study by Meyer and Rialland suggests that vowels are stripped to their inherent class of sound, which is communicated in the whistle in these ways: voice ( vs ) is transmitted by the whistled feature [-continuity]. A silent pause in the whistle communicates [+voice] (), and a [+continuous] consonant gives the quality [-voice] (). Placement of the consonant (dental, palatal, fricative) is transmitted in whistle by the loci, the sharpness or speed, of the formant transitions between vowels. Consonant classes are simplified into four classes. Extra high loci (near vertical formant loci) denotes affricates and stridents, rising loci denotes alveolar, medial (loci just above the vowel formant) denotes palatal, and falling (low loci) denotes pharyngeal, labial, and fricative. This gives eight whistled consonants, but including tone gradual decay (with intensity falling off) as a feature on continuous and interrupted sounds gives 10 consonants. In these situations gradual decay is given [+voice], and continuous is given [+liquid].

The representation of is treated as a broken high pitch in Silbo though in the spoken language, is a continuous high pitch consonant. There are two reasons for the anomaly. One is that in functional terms, is high in frequency and thus extremely useful. Also , as the continuous high-pitched consonant of Silbo already represents many other consonants of the spoken language (, , , , , , and ), it would be very confusing to add to that list. Thus, as the broken high-pitched consonant does not fully represent and , it can represent the frequently-used .

===Cognitive features===
Studies have shown that Silbo Gomero speakers process the whistled register in the same way as standard spoken language. Studies by Manuel Carreiras of the University of La Laguna and David Corina of the University of Washington published in 2004 and 2005 involved two participant groups of Spanish-speakers. One group spoke Silbo, and the other did not. Results obtained from monitoring the participants&#x27; brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging show that while non-speakers of Silbo merely process Silbo as whistling, Silbo-speakers process the sounds in the same linguistic centres of the brain as those that process Spanish sentences.

==In popular culture==
The filmmaker and photographer Francesca Phillips wrote and directed a 26-minute documentary on the usage of Silbo Gomero in La Gomera, &quot;Written in the Wind&quot; (2009). The movie won Best Short Documentary in Anthropology at the World Mountain Documentary Festival held in Qinghai, China, in 2010.

The Romanian filmmaker Corneliu Porumboiu directed the 2019 film &quot;The Whistlers&quot;, in which Silbo features prominently.

The French singer Féloche dedicated a song to Silbo, released in an album of the same name.

There are other examples of transposition of an oral natural language into a pitch string. When quickly spoken, Yoruba vowels are assimilated and consonants elided and so linguistic information is carried by the tone system, which can therefore be transposed into talking drums.

<text>The Jefferson Memorial is a national memorial in Washington, D.C., built in honor of Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the United States Declaration of Independence, a central intellectual force behind the American Revolution, a founder of the Democratic-Republican Party, and the nation&#x27;s third president.

Built between 1939 and 1943, the memorial features multiple quotes from Jefferson intended to capture his ideology and philosophy, known as Jeffersonian democracy, which was staunchly supportive of American republicanism, individual rights, religious freedom, states&#x27; rights, virtue, and prioritized and valued what he saw as the undervalued independent yeoman. Jefferson was simultaneously deeply skeptical of cities and financiers and hostile to aristocracy, elitism, and corruption. He is widely considered among the most influential political minds of his era and one of the most consequential intellectual forces behind both the American Revolution and the American Enlightenment.

The Jefferson Memorial is built in neoclassical style and is situated in West Potomac Park on the shore of the Potomac River. It was designed by John Russell Pope, a New York City architect, and built by Philadelphia contractor John McShain. Construction on the memorial began in 1939 and was completed in 1943, though the bronze statue of Jefferson was not completed and added until four years after its dedication and opening, in 1947. Pope made references to the Roman Pantheon, whose designer was Apollodorus of Damascus, and to Jefferson&#x27;s own design for the rotunda at the University of Virginia as inspirations for the memorial&#x27;s aesthetics.

The Jefferson Memorial and the White House form anchor points to the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The Washington Monument, initially intended to be built at the intersection of the White House and the Jefferson Memorial&#x27;s site, was ultimately built farther east because the ground at that location was deemed too soft and swampy.

The Jefferson Memorial is a designated national memorial and is managed by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior&#x27;s National Mall and Memorial Parks division. In 1966, the Jefferson Memorial was named to the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2007, it ranked fourth on the &quot;list of America&#x27;s favorite architecture&quot;, published by the American Institute of Architects.

==History==
===Early considerations===
The site ultimately selected for the Jefferson Memorial&#x27;s construction was appealing at least partly because it was located directly south of, and in view of, the White House. By 1901, the Senate Park Commission, in the McMillan Plan, proposed building a Pantheon-like structure on the site that would host &quot;the statues of the illustrious men of the nation, or whether the memory of some individual shall be honored by a monument of the first rank may be left to the future,&quot; but no action was taken by Congress on the commission&#x27;s recommendation.

The completion of the Tidal Basin Inlet Bridge in 1908 helped facilitate and expand recreational usage of East and West Potomac Parks. In 1918, large liquid chlorine dispensers were installed under the bridge to treat the water, which made the Tidal Basin, also known as Twining Lake, suitable for swimming. The Tidal Basin Beach, on the site of the future Jefferson Memorial, opened in May 1918, operating as a &quot;Whites Only&quot; facility until 1925, when it was permanently closed to avoid addressing the question of whether it should be racially integrated. The same year, a design competition was held for a memorial to Theodore Roosevelt. The winning design, submitted by John Russell Pope, consisted of a half-circle memorial situated next to a circular basin. Like the McMillan Plan in 1901, the plan was never funded by Congress or acted upon.

===Funding and authorization===
Another opportunity for the Jefferson Memorial&#x27;s development emerged in 1934, when then President Franklin Roosevelt, who came to admire Jefferson after reading a book on Jefferson by his friend Claude G. Bowers, inquired with the Commission of Fine Arts about erecting a memorial to Jefferson. Roosevelt included plans for the Jefferson Memorial in the Federal Triangle project, which was then under construction. Later the same year, Congressman John J. Boyland followed Roosevelt&#x27;s lead, urging Congress to create the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Commission to explore the memorial&#x27;s development. Boylan was appointed the Commission&#x27;s first chairman, and Congress eventually appropriated $3 million for the Jefferson Memorial.

The following year, in 1935, the Commission chose John Russell Pope as architect for the Jefferson Memorial. Pope had served previously as architect for the National Archives Building and the original West Building of the National Gallery of Art. He prepared four different plans for the project, each on a different site. One was on the Anacostia River at the end of East Capitol Street; one at Lincoln Park; one on the south side of the National Mall across from the National Archives administration building; and one was situated on the Tidal Basin, directly south of the White House. The Commission preferred the site on the Tidal Basin mainly because it was the most prominent site of those proposed and completed the four-point plan called for by the McMillan Commission, which encompassed the region including the Lincoln Memorial to the Capitol and from the White House to the Tidal Basin site. Pope designed a large pantheon-like structure designed to be situated on a square platform, flanked by two smaller, rectangular, colonnaded buildings.

===Construction===
Construction on the Jefferson Memorial began December 15, 1938. The cornerstone was laid roughly eleven months later, on November 15, 1939, by Roosevelt himself. By this point, Pope had died in 1937 and his surviving partners, Daniel P. Higgins and Otto R. Eggers, assumed leadership for the Jefferson Memorial&#x27;s construction. At the request of the Commission of Fine Arts, a slightly more conservative design for the memorial was agreed upon. The memorial&#x27;s cost was approximately $3 million.
Construction commenced amid some opposition. The Commission of Fine Arts never actually approved any design for the memorial and even published a pamphlet in 1939 opposing both the proposed design and site for the memorial. Additionally, some Washingtonians opposed the proposed location for it because it did not align with L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s original plan for the city, and many established elm and cherry trees, including rare stock donated by Japan in 1912, would be removed under the memorial&#x27;s original plan. Construction continued amid the opposition, which included women protestors chaining themselves to cherry trees around the construction site. Opposition to the memorial proved dismaying to Roosevelt, but the opposition diminished notably once revised plans identified a means for maintaining the surrounding cherry trees amidst the memorial&#x27;s construction.

In 1939, the Memorial Commission hosted a competition to select a sculptor for the planned Jefferson statue to be placed in the center of the memorial. They received 101 entries and chose six finalists. Of the six, Rudulph Evans was chosen as the main sculptor, and Adolph A. Weinman was chosen to sculpt the pediment relief situated above the memorial&#x27;s entrance.

Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. designed the memorial landscape, which featured a simple design within a circular driveway including primarily Evergreen trees with limited flowering trees or shrubs. The design was perceived as too thin, so white pines and some other plantings were later added before the memorial&#x27;s dedication in 1943. In the 1970s, nearly three decades after the memorial&#x27;s opening, additional changes to Olmsted&#x27;s landscaping were implemented. But in 1993 and 2000, attempts to restore the integrity of Olmsted&#x27;s initial design were made. Roosevelt ordered trees be cut so that the Jefferson Memorial was clearly visible from the White House; additional tree pruning was also completed to create an unobstructed view between the Jefferson Memorial and Lincoln Memorial.

On April 13, 1943, the 200th anniversary of Jefferson&#x27;s birthday, the Jefferson Memorial was officially dedicated and opened by Roosevelt. At the time, Evans&#x27; statue had not yet been finished due to material shortages that emerged during World War II. Instead, the memorial opened with a temporary plaster cast statue similar to the bronze statue that Evans ultimately completed four years later, in 1947. The statue&#x27;s cast was developed by Roman Bronze Works in New York City.

=== Following history ===
On October 15, 1966, in recognition of the Jefferson Memorial&#x27;s historical and artistic significance, the Jefferson Memorial was named to the National Register of Historic Places.

On September 2, 2020, there was a task force known as the District of Columbia Facilities and Commemorative Expressions (DCFACES), created in a response to the George Floyd protests by Washington D.C Mayor Muriel Bowser, who published a report which recommended &quot;renaming, relocating or adding context to dozens of monuments, schools, parks and buildings in [Washington, D.C.] because of their namesakes participation in slavery or racial oppression&quot;. In the report, “DCFACES” had advised Mayor Bowser to request and convince the U.S. federal government to &quot;remove, relocate, or contextualize&quot; the Jefferson Memorial due to Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s ownership of slaves.

==Description and features==
===Exterior===
The Jefferson Memorial is composed of circular marble steps, a portico, a circular colonnade of Ionic order columns, and a shallow dome. The building is open to the elements. It has a diameter of approximately .

The memorial is constructed with white Imperial Danby marble taken from Vermont, which rests on a series of granite and marble-stepped terraces. A flight of granite and marble stairs and platforms, flanked by granite buttresses, leads up to the memorial from the Tidal Basin to a portico with a triangular pediment.

The pediment features a sculpture by Adolph Alexander Weinman depicting the Committee of Five, the five members of the committee charged with drafting the U.S. Declaration of Independence. In addition to Jefferson, who was the primary author, committee members included John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston, and Roger Sherman. A cornice with an egg and dart molding surrounds this pediment, and below that is a plain frieze.

===Interior===
The memorial&#x27;s interior has a tall, bronze statue of Jefferson developed by sculptor Rudulph Evans. The statue was added four years after the dedication. Among many Jefferson quotes inside the memorial, one of the most prominently situated are those inscribed in the frieze below the dome: &quot;I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.&quot; This sentence is taken from a letter written by Jefferson on September 23, 1800, to Benjamin Rush in which Jefferson defends the constitutional refusal to recognize a state religion.

On the panel of the southwest interior wall are excerpts from the United States Declaration of Independence:

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men. We...solemnly publish and declare, that these colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent states...And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

The inscription uses the word &quot;&quot;, as appears in Jefferson&#x27;s draft rather than &quot;&quot; as ultimately appeared in the final Declaration.

On the panel of the northwest interior wall is a quote from the 1777 Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which excludes the quote&#x27;s final sentence and is taken from an August 28, 1789, letter Jefferson wrote to James Madison:

Almighty God hath created the mind free...All attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens...are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion...No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship or ministry or shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief, but all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion. I know but one code of morality for men whether acting singly or collectively.

The Jefferson quotes from the panel on the northeast interior wall come from multiple sources. The first, which begins &quot;God who gave us life gave us liberty&quot; is from &quot;A Summary View of the Rights of British America&quot;. The second, third, and fourth sentences are from &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;. The fifth quote, which begins &quot;Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than that these people are to be free&quot; is from Jefferson&#x27;s autobiography. The sixth sentence, beginning &quot;Establish the law...&quot;, is from a letter of August 13, 1786, to George Wythe. The final sentence is from a letter of January 4, 1786, to George Washington:

God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever. Commerce between master and slave is despotism. Nothing is more certainly written in the book of fate than these people are to be free. Establish the law for educating the common people. This it is the business of the state to effect and on a general plan.

The inscription on the panel of the southeast interior wall is excerpted from Jefferson&#x27;s July 12, 1816, letter to Samuel Kercheval:

I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions. But laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.

A lower level of the structure contains a gift shop and a museum focusing on Jefferson&#x27;s life and political career.

==Location==

The monument is located in West Potomac Park in Washington, D.C., on the shore of the Potomac River&#x27;s Tidal Basin. The park is enhanced with the massed planting of Japanese cherry blossom trees, which pre-dated the memorial&#x27;s construction and were a 1912 gift from the people of Japan.

Although the Jefferson Memorial is geographically removed from other buildings and monuments in Washington, D.C., the National Mall, and Washington Metro, the memorial plays host to many events and ceremonies each year, including memorial exercises, the Easter Sunrise Service, and the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, and ranks highly among destinations for visitors to the city each year.

<text>Ten15 is an algebraically specified abstract machine. It was developed by Foster, Currie et al. at the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment at Malvern, Worcestershire, during the 1980s. It arose from earlier work on the Flex machine, which was a capability computer implemented via microcode. Ten15 was intended to offer an intermediate language common to all implementations of the Flex architecture for portability purposes. It had the side effect of making the benefits of that work available on modern processors lacking a microcode facility.

Ten15 served as an intermediate language for compilers, but with several unique features, some of which have still to see the light of day in everyday systems. Firstly, it was strongly typed, yet wide enough in application to support most languages — C being an exception, chiefly because C deliberately treats an array similar to a pointer to the first element of that array. This ultimately led to Ten15&#x27;s development into TDF, which in turn formed the basis for ANDF. Secondly, it offered a persistent, write-only filestore mechanism, allowing arbitrary data structures to be written and retrieved without conversion into an external representation.

== Historical note ==
Why &#x27;Ten15&#x27;? Nic Peeling reports that during early discussions of the concepts of Ten15, it was agreed that this was important and should have a name - but what? Ian Currie looked up at the clock and said &#x27;Why not call it 10:15?&#x27;

<text>The Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) is an instrument aboard EUMETSAT&#x27;s Meteosat Second Generation geostationary satellites designed to make accurate measurements of the Earth radiation budget. 
It was produced by a European consortium consisting of the United Kingdom, Belgium and Italy. The first, known as GERB 2, was launched on 28 August 2002 on an Ariane 5 rocket. The second, GERB 1, was launched on 21 December 2005, and the third, GERB3, on 5 July 2012. The last GERB 4 device was launched 14 July 2015. The first launched GERB 2 on MSG 1 is currently situated over the Indian Ocean at 41.5°E, while GERBs 1 and 3 on MSG 2 and 3 are still located over the standard Africa EUMETSAT position. GERB 4 on MSG is yet to become operational.

==Scientific motivations and objectives==

The unprecedented rate of atmospheric increase occurring since the Industrial Revolution due to human activity is of much concern to scientists as it has occurred an order of magnitude faster than planet Earth has ever experienced. Climate models described as Global Circulation Models (GCMs) are currently avenue to investigate and try and predict how Earth climate will change in response such an un-precedented rate of change. Such computer models largely agree on many predictions of how climate will be &#x27;forced&#x27; to a different state by such changes but there is still much disagreement, more specifically how such forcing will also results in &#x27;feedbacks&#x27; to the system. For example, increased will increase the greenhouse effect resulting in warmer atmosphere and more melting of Arctic ice. However it is known that a warmer atmosphere can for example contain a higher quantity of water vapor at the same relative humidity, and the melting of highly reflective white Arctic ice will expose open ocean to sunlight. Since water vapor is itself a very strong greenhouse gas and dark Arctic Ocean will absorb more sunlight than highly reflected floating ice, these are both reasonably well understood to be positive feedbacks that will act to accelerate the rate of global warming. Perhaps the least understood aspect of climate change involves clouds, and how they might change in-response to straight atmospheric warming from increased . These effects collectively referred to as cloud forcing or Cloud Radiative Forcing (CRF) and Feedback are not yet understood to the level where it can be predicted with certainty whether their possible feedbacks will in total be positive and accelerate, or negative and slow down global warming. The actions of the Earth weather/climate system are essentially the work done from a global scale heat engine, the heat into which comes from all the absorbed solar energy while the heat out is from thermal infra-red emissions back to space. These two radiative fluxes are referred to as Short-Wave (SW for solar) and Long-Wave (LW for IR) components in what is known as the Earth Radiation Budget (ERB, naturally the heat in requires the reflected SW to be measured and subtracted from the also needed in incoming solar flux). Clouds hence naturally have a huge effect on the ERB due to their high solar SW reflectivity and their strong absorption of outgoing thermal LW. Globally ERB fluxes can only be measured from orbit and have been collected since the 1970s by missions from the US and Europe, most extensively since 1998 by the NASA Clouds and the Earth&#x27;s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments in low Earth orbit. Such orbital platforms however at most see each point of Earth only twice per day, while cloud formation and modulation of the ERB occurs on the time scale of minutes (see Fig.1). Hence although vital for tracking global changes in the ERB such low orbital measurements cannot be directly used to validate computer simulations of changes to convective cloud formation and dissipation in direct response to the inevitable surface warming due to increases etc. To address this deficiency in the Earth observing system the European consortium between the UK, Belgium and Italy embarked on the Geo-stationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) project, with the intention of placing a highly accurate ERB radiometer on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) spin stabilized platforms.

==GERB device and calibration==

The GERB project is led by the Space and Atmospheric Group (SPAT) based at Imperial College UK, with Professor John. E. Harries the original Principal Investigator and now succeeded by Dr Helen Brindley. The devices themselves were constructed by Rutherford Appleton Laboratory using an Italian 3 mirror silver telescope and electronics designed by the Space Science center at the University of Leicester UK. Each of the four completed GERB devices underwent extensive ground radiometric calibration in a Vacuum Calibration Chamber (VCC) at the Earth Observation and Characterization Facility (EOCF) also the Imperial College and designed by Ray Wrigley. Such tests included confirmation of linearity, LW radiometric gain determination using Warm and Cold BlackBodies (WBB &amp; CBB), SW gain determination using Visible Calibration Source (VISCS) lamp and spot checks on the system level spectral response.

Each GERB device makes use of a linear array of blackened thermopile detectors manufactured by Honeywell, which stare at the Earth on each 100rpm rotation of the MSG platform by making use of a De-Scan Mirror (DSM). Hence a column of the Earth disk is taken on each revolution allowing 250x256 Total channel samples followed by 250x256 SW samples with the quartz filter in place every 5 minutes (i.e. the relative phase of the DSM to MSG rotation is shifted slightly each rotation, see Fig.4 bottom right). On each rotation the detectors hence also see the Internal Blackbody (IBB) and Calibration Monitor (CalMon) to allow continuous upgrading of LW &amp; SW gain changes. Its placement toward the outskirts of the 3 meter wide MSG spinning platform demanded rigorous design of the GERB device to withstand the 16g constant centrifugal force to which it is exposed as the DSM rotates.

Every 15mins after 3 complete Total and SW 250x256 arrays of the Earth disk are taken a synthetic LW result is obtained from the mean difference between the two. Such ERB results are then combined with a resolution enhancement and cloud retrievals using the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) also on the MSG platform. The combination of GERB and SEVIRI through data synergy also required detailed mapping of each of the 256 GERB detector/telescope Field of View response or Point Spread Function (PSF, see Matthews (2004) ). This was done using a He-Ne laser computer controlled to map each of the 256 thermopiles responses after being covered with gold blacking. Full details of the GERB ground calibration can be obtained at Matthews (2003). The spectral response or measure of the relative absorption at different wavelength of light for each GERB detector is required for the process of un-filtering each thermopile&#x27;s raw signal. This uses radiative transfer models to estimate the spectral shape of a particular scene radiance to estimate an un-filtering ratio, or the factor needed to account for non-uniform spectral response. For each GERB device this relies on the multiplication of unit level laboratory measurements of detector, telescope, DSM and quartz filter spectral throughput/absorption. The accuracy of GERB SW results is directly dependent on the quality of such measurements as the SW gain is determined using the VISCS lamp, whose spectrum is significantly shifted to longer wavelengths compared to that of the Sun. Such GERB accuracy is currently estimated to be around the 2% level by ref. Such un-filtering is performed by the Royal Meteorological Institute Belgium (RMIB), along with the synergy with SEVIRI data and conversion from radiance to irradiance using Angular Dependency Models (ADMs).

===GERB in-flight calibration===

For each of the 100 rotations per minute every GERB detector obtains a scan of both the Internal Blackbody (IBB) and CalMon solar diffuser. The gain in Counts per W and offsets of each thermopile pixel are regularly updated based on the known temperature of the IBB and its signal&#x27;s difference from that of the Earthview. The original intention was to use the aluminium solar diffuser CalMon views to track changes in the GERB device throughput of solar photons (see Equations developed by J. Mueller). However, in-flight solar diffusers and their sunlight transmission changes drastically on orbit such that the diffusers on CERES were deemed un-usable by NASA. Also the integrating sphere nature of the CalMon means that solar photons will likely have undergone many reflections off aluminium on the way to the GERB telescope, likely significantly reducing energy at the 830 nm dip in aluminium reflectivity by an unknown amount. Possible alternatives to track changes to GERB device solar response include comparison to other ERB devices such as the proposed NASA CLARREO instrument, or perhaps other broadband devices assuming their calibration is later validated. Another possibility is the use of Moon views as used by the SeaWIFS project to ensure stability of Earth results (see Fig.5).

==GERB data==

GERB data is available from the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory GGSPS download site below as shown in the animation of Fig.6 which displayed full Earth Disk reflected SW (left) and outgoing LW (right). This animation shows 24hrs worth of GERB SW and LW fluxes which will enable climate scientists to validate how GCMs simulate cloud formation and dissipation and the effects on the ERB.

===GERB-SEVIRI synergy===

As ERB fluxes from the CERES instruments are paired with MODIS imager cloud retrievals, it was always the intention to tie GERB SW and LW measurements with results from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) primary device on the MSG platforms. In addition to the cloud/aerosol retrievals from the narrow-band SEVIRI instrument, the high spatial resolution imager data is combined with the accuracy of GERB to perform resolution enhancement of climate driving fluxes to better evaluate climate model simulations of cloud formation/dissipation and know how they may speed up or slow down climate change. SEVIRI radiances are also used in the GERB un-filtering process to help estimate the spectral shape of the scene being viewed.

===Data access===

In addition to the Rutherford GGSPS download site, a new access hub is being set up at the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA), which is also listed in the URLs below that will allow access to GERB files.

<doc id="376707" wikidata="Q206904" url="?curid=376707" title="R (programming language)">
<text>R is a programming language for statistical computing and data visualization. It has been adopted in the fields of data mining, bioinformatics and data analysis.

The core &quot;R&quot; language is augmented by a large number of extension packages, containing reusable code, documentation, and sample data.

&quot;R&quot; software is open-source and free software. It is licensed by the GNU Project and available under the GNU General Public License. It is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself. Precompiled executables are provided for various operating systems.

As an interpreted language, &quot;R&quot; has a native command line interface. Moreover, multiple third-party graphical user interfaces are available, such as RStudio—an integrated development environment—and Jupyter—a notebook interface.

== History ==
&quot;R&quot; was started by professors Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as a programming language to teach introductory statistics at the University of Auckland. The language was inspired by the S programming language, with most S programs able to run unaltered in &quot;R&quot;. The language was also inspired by Scheme&#x27;s lexical scoping, allowing for local variables.

The name of the language, &quot;R&quot;, comes from being both an S language successor as well as the shared first letter of the authors, Ross and Robert. In August 1993, Ihaka and Gentleman posted a binary of &quot;R&quot; on StatLib — a data archive website. At the same time, they announced the posting on the &quot;s-news&quot; mailing list. On December 5, 1997, &quot;R&quot; became a GNU project when version 0.60 was released. On February 29, 2000, the 1.0 version was released.

== Packages ==
R packages are collections of functions, documentation, and data that expand R. For example, packages add report features such as RMarkdown, Quarto, knitr and Sweave. Packages also add the capability to implement various statistical techniques such as linear, generalized linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, spatial analysis, time-series analysis, and clustering. Easy package installation and use have contributed to the language&#x27;s adoption in data science.

Base packages are immediately available when starting R and provide the necessary syntax and commands for programming, computing, graphics production, basic arithmetic, and statistical functionality.

The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) was founded in 1997 by Kurt Hornik and Friedrich Leisch to host R&#x27;s source code, executable files, documentation, and user-created packages. Its name and scope mimic the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network and the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. CRAN originally had three mirrors and 12 contributed packages. , it has 99 mirrors and 21,513 contributed packages. Packages are also available on repositories R-Forge, Omegahat, and GitHub.

The Task Views on the CRAN web site list packages in fields such as causal inference, finance, genetics, high-performance computing, machine learning, medical imaging, meta-analysis, social sciences, and spatial statistics.

The Bioconductor project provides packages for genomic data analysis, complementary DNA, microarray, and high-throughput sequencing methods.

The tidyverse package bundles several subsidiary packages that provide a common interface for tasks related to accessing and processing &quot;tidy data&quot;, data contained in a two-dimensional table with a single row for each observation and a single column for each variable.

Installing a package occurs only once. For example, to install the &quot;tidyverse&quot; package:

&gt; install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)
To load the functions, data, and documentation of a package, one executes the codice_1 function. To load &quot;tidyverse&quot;:

&gt; # Package name can be enclosed in quotes
&gt; library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)

&gt; # But also the package name can be called without quotes
&gt; library(tidyverse)
== Interfaces ==
R comes installed with a command line console. Available for installation are various integrated development environments (IDE). IDEs for R include R.app (OSX/macOS only), Rattle GUI, R Commander, RKWard, RStudio, and Tinn-R.

General purpose IDEs that support R include Eclipse via the StatET plugin and Visual Studio via R Tools for Visual Studio.

Editors that support R include Emacs, Vim via the Nvim-R plugin, Kate, LyX via Sweave, WinEdt (website), and Jupyter (website).

Scripting languages that support R include Python (website), Perl (website), Ruby (source code), F# (website), and Julia (source code).

General purpose programming languages that support R include Java via the Rserve socket server, and .NET C# (website).

Statistical frameworks which use R in the background include Jamovi and JASP.

== Community ==
The R Core Team was founded in 1997 to maintain the &quot;R&quot; source code. The R Foundation for Statistical Computing was founded in April 2003 to provide financial support. The R Consortium is a Linux Foundation project to develop &quot;R&quot; infrastructure.

&quot;The R Journal&quot; is an open access, academic journal which features short to medium-length articles on the use and development of R. It includes articles on packages, programming tips, CRAN news, and foundation news.

The R community hosts many conferences and in-person meetups - see the community maintained GitHub list. These groups include:

* UseR!: an annual international R user conference (website)
* Directions in Statistical Computing (DSC) (website)
* R-Ladies: an organization to promote gender diversity in the R community (website)
* SatRdays: R-focused conferences held on Saturdays (website)
* R Conference (website)
* posit::conf (formerly known as rstudio::conf) (website)

== Implementations ==
The main R implementation is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself. Other implementations include:
* pretty quick R (pqR), by Radford M. Neal, attempts to improve memory management.
* Renjin is an implementation of &quot;R&quot; for the Java Virtual Machine.
* CXXR and Riposte are implementations of &quot;R&quot; written in C++.
* Oracle&#x27;s FastR is an implementation of &quot;R&quot;, built on GraalVM.
* TIBCO Software, creator of S-PLUS, wrote TERR — an &quot;R&quot; implementation to integrate with Spotfire.

Microsoft R Open (MRO) was an &quot;R&quot; implementation. As of 30 June 2021, Microsoft started to phase out MRO in favor of the CRAN distribution.

== Commercial support ==

Although R is an open-source project, some companies provide commercial support:
* Oracle provides commercial support for the &quot;Big Data Appliance&quot;, which integrates R into its other products.
* IBM provides commercial support for in-Hadoop execution of R.

== Examples ==
=== Hello, World! ===
&quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:

&gt; print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
[1] &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
=== Basic syntax ===
The following examples illustrate the basic syntax of the language and use of the command-line interface. (An expanded list of standard language features can be found in the R manual, &quot;An Introduction to R&quot;.)

In R, the generally preferred assignment operator is an arrow made from two characters codice_2, although codice_3 can be used in some cases.
&gt; x &lt;- 1:6 # Create a numeric vector in the current environment
&gt; y &lt;- x^2 # Create vector based on the values in x.
&gt; print(y) # Print the vector’s contents.
[1] 1 4 9 16 25 36

&gt; z &lt;- x + y # Create a new vector that is the sum of x and y
&gt; z # Return the contents of z to the current environment.
[1] 2 6 12 20 30 42

&gt; z_matrix &lt;- matrix(z, nrow = 3) # Create a new matrix that turns the vector z into a 3x2 matrix object
&gt; z_matrix 
 [,1] [,2]
[1,] 2 20
[2,] 6 30
[3,] 12 42

&gt; 2 * t(z_matrix) - 2 # Transpose the matrix, multiply every element by 2, subtract 2 from each element in the matrix, and return the results to the terminal.
 [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 2 10 22
[2,] 38 58 82

&gt; new_df &lt;- data.frame(t(z_matrix), row.names = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;)) # Create a new data.frame object that contains the data from a transposed z_matrix, with row names &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27;
&gt; names(new_df) &lt;- c(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;) # Set the column names of new_df as X, Y, and Z.
&gt; print(new_df) # Print the current results.
 X Y Z
A 2 6 12
B 20 30 42

&gt; new_df$Z # Output the Z column
[1] 12 42

&gt; new_df$Z == new_df[&#x27;Z&#x27;] &amp;&amp; new_df[3] == new_df$Z # The data.frame column Z can be accessed using $Z, [&#x27;Z&#x27;], or [3] syntax and the values are the same. 
[1] TRUE

&gt; attributes(new_df) # Print attributes information about the new_df object
$names
[1] &quot;X&quot; &quot;Y&quot; &quot;Z&quot;

$row.names
[1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot;

$class
[1] &quot;data.frame&quot;

&gt; attributes(new_df)$row.names &lt;- c(&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;) # Access and then change the row.names attribute; can also be done using rownames()
&gt; new_df
 X Y Z
one 2 6 12
two 20 30 42

=== Structure of a function ===
One of R&#x27;s strengths is the ease of creating new functions. Objects in the function body remain local to the function, and any data type may be returned. In R, almost all functions and all user-defined functions are closures.

Create a function:

# The input parameters are x and y.
# The function returns a linear combination of x and y.
f &lt;- function(x, y) {
 z &lt;- 3 * x + 4 * y

 # an explicit return() statement is optional, could be replaced with simply `z`
 return(z)


Usage output:

&gt; f(1, 2)
[1] 11

&gt; f(c(1, 2, 3), c(5, 3, 4))
[1] 23 18 25

&gt; f(1:3, 4)
[1] 19 22 25
It is possible to define functions to be used as infix operators with the special syntax codice_4 where &quot;name&quot; is the function variable name:

&gt; `%sumx2y2%` &lt;- function(e1, e2) {e1 ^ 2 + e2 ^ 2}
&gt; 1:3 %sumx2y2% -(1:3)
[1] 2 8 18 
Since version 4.1.0 functions can be written in a short notation, which is useful for passing anonymous functions to higher-order functions: 

&gt; sapply(1:5, \(i) i^2) # here \(i) is the same as function(i) 
[1] 1 4 9 16 25
=== Native pipe operator ===
In R version 4.1.0, a native pipe operator, codice_5, was introduced. This operator allows users to chain functions together one after another, instead of a nested function call.
&gt; nrow(subset(mtcars, cyl == 4)) # Nested without the pipe character
[1] 11

&gt; mtcars |&gt; subset(cyl == 4) |&gt; nrow() # Using the pipe character
[1] 11
Another alternative to nested functions, in contrast to using the pipe character, is using intermediate objects:
&gt; mtcars_subset_rows &lt;- subset(mtcars, cyl == 4)
&gt; num_mtcars_subset &lt;- nrow(mtcars_subset_rows)
&gt; print(num_mtcars_subset)
[1] 11
While the pipe operator can produce code that is easier to read, it has been advised to pipe together at most 10 to 15 lines and chunk code into sub-tasks which are saved into objects with meaningful names. Here is an example with fewer than 10 lines that some readers may still struggle to grasp without intermediate named steps:(\(x, n = 42, key = c(letters, LETTERS, &quot; &quot;, &quot;:&quot;, &quot;)&quot;))
 strsplit(x, &quot;&quot;)1 |&gt;
 (Vectorize(\(chr) which(chr == key) - 1))() |&gt;
 (`+`)(n) |&gt;
 (`%%`)(length(key)) |&gt;
 (\(i) key[i + 1])() |&gt;
 paste(collapse = &quot;&quot;)
)(&quot;duvFkvFksnvEyLkHAErnqnoyr&quot;)

=== Object-oriented programming ===
The R language has native support for object-oriented programming. There are two native frameworks, the so-called S3 and S4 systems. The former, being more informal, supports single dispatch on the first argument and objects are assigned to a class by just setting a &quot;class&quot; attribute in each object. The latter is a Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)-like system of formal classes (also derived from S) and generic methods that supports multiple dispatch and multiple inheritance

In the example, codice_6 is a generic function that dispatches to different methods depending on whether its argument is a numeric vector or a &quot;factor&quot;:

&gt; data &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, NA)
&gt; summary(data)
 Length Class Mode 
 5 character character 
&gt; summary(as.factor(data))
 a b c NA&#x27;s 
 2 1 1 1 
=== Modeling and plotting ===

The R language has built-in support for data modeling and graphics. The following example shows how R can generate and plot a linear model with residuals.

# Create x and y values
x &lt;- 1:6
y &lt;- x^2

# Linear regression model y = A + B * x
model &lt;- lm(y ~ x)

# Display an in-depth summary of the model
summary(model)

# Create a 2 by 2 layout for figures
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

# Output diagnostic plots of the model
plot(model)
Output:

Residuals:
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 3.3333 -0.6667 -2.6667 -2.6667 -0.6667 3.3333

Coefficients:
 Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) 
(Intercept) -9.3333 2.8441 -3.282 0.030453 * 
x 7.0000 0.7303 9.585 0.000662 ***
Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 3.055 on 4 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared: 0.9583, Adjusted R-squared: 0.9478
F-statistic: 91.88 on 1 and 4 DF, p-value: 0.000662
=== Mandelbrot set ===

This Mandelbrot set example highlights the use of complex numbers. It models the first 20 iterations of the equation codice_7, where codice_8 represents different complex constants.

Install the package that provides the codice_9 function beforehand:

install.packages(&quot;caTools&quot;)
R Source code:

library(caTools)

jet.colors &lt;-
 colorRampPalette(
 c(&quot;green&quot;, &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;#007FFF&quot;, &quot;cyan&quot;, &quot;#7FFF7F&quot;,
 &quot;white&quot;, &quot;#FF7F00&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;#7F0000&quot;))

dx &lt;- 1500 # define width
dy &lt;- 1400 # define height

C &lt;-
 complex(
 real = rep(seq(-2.2, 1.0, length.out = dx), each = dy),
 imag = rep(seq(-1.2, 1.2, length.out = dy), times = dx)

# reshape as matrix of complex numbers
C &lt;- matrix(C, dy, dx)

# initialize output 3D array
X &lt;- array(0, c(dy, dx, 20))

Z &lt;- 0

# loop with 20 iterations
for (k in 1:20) {

 # the central difference equation
 Z &lt;- Z^2 + C

 # capture the results
 X[, , k] &lt;- exp(-abs(Z))

== Version names ==

All R version releases from 2.14.0 onward have codenames that make reference to Peanuts comics and films.

In 2018, core R developer Peter Dalgaard presented a history of R releases since 1997. Some notable early releases before the named releases include:

* Version 1.0.0 released on February 29, 2000 (2000-02-29), a leap day
* Version 2.0.0 released on October 4, 2004 (2004-10-04), &quot;which at least had a nice ring to it&quot;

The idea of naming R version releases was inspired by the Debian and Ubuntu version naming system. Dalgaard also noted that another reason for the use of Peanuts references for R codenames is because, &quot;everyone in statistics is a P-nut&quot;.

<text>William Turner (1509/10 – 13 July 1568) was an English divine and reformer, a physician and a natural historian. He has been called “the father of English botany”. He studied medicine in Italy, and was a friend of the great Swiss naturalist, Conrad Gessner. He was an early herbalist and ornithologist, and it is in these fields that the most interest lies today. He is known as being one of the first “parson-naturalists” in England.

He first published &quot;Libellus de Re herbaria&quot; in Latin in 1538, and later translated it into English because he believed herbalists were not sharing their knowledge. Turner&#x27;s works were condemned under Henry VIII and under Mary Tudor.

==Biography==


===Early years===
Turner was born in Morpeth, Northumberland, in or around 1508. His father was probably a tanner of the same name. He studied at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge University, from 1526 to 1533, where he received his B.A. in 1530 and his M.A. in 1533. He was a Fellow and Senior Treasurer of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he published several works, including &quot;Libellus de re herbaria&quot;, in 1538. He spent much of his leisure in the careful study of plants which he sought for in their native habitat, and described with an accuracy hitherto unknown in England.

In 1540, he began travelling about preaching until he was arrested. After his release, he went on to study medicine in Italy, at Ferrara and Bologna, from 1540 to 1542 and was incorporated M.D. at one of these universities. He married Jane Auder (perhaps a widow of a Mr Cage when they married) who gave birth to a son Peter in 1542. After his death, she remarried Richard Cox, Bishop of Ely.

===Career===
After completing his medical degree, he became physician to the Earl of Emden. Back in England, he became chaplain and physician to the Duke of Somerset, and through Somerset&#x27;s influence, he obtained ecclesiastical preferment. The position as Somerset&#x27;s physician also led to practice among upper society. He was prebendary of Botevant in York Cathedral in 1550, and Dean of Wells Cathedral from 1551 to 1553, where he established a herbal garden. When Mary I of England acceded to the throne, Turner went into exile once again. From 1553 to 1558, he lived in Wissembourg in Alsatian Rhineland - a Protestant centre linked to Martin Bucer - and supported himself as a physician. He became a supporter of Zwingli at this time, if not before.

After the succession of Elizabeth I of England in 1558, Turner returned to England, and was once again Dean of Wells Cathedral from 1560 to 1564. His attempts to bring the English church into an agreement with the reformed churches of Germany and Switzerland led to his suspension for nonconformity in 1564. Turner died in London on 7 July 1568 at his home in Crutched Friars, in the City of London, and is buried in the church of St Olave Hart Street. An engraved stone on the southeast wall of this church commemorates Turner. Thomas Lever, one of the great puritan preachers of the period, delivered the sermon at his funeral.

Quite early in his career, Turner became interested in natural history and set out to produce reliable lists of English plants and animals, which he published as &quot;Libellus de re herbaria&quot; in 1538. In 1544, Turner published &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Principal Birds of Aristotle and Pliny...&quot;), which not only discussed the principal birds and bird names mentioned by Aristotle and Pliny the Elder but also added accurate descriptions and life histories of birds from his own extensive ornithological knowledge. This is the first &quot;printed&quot; book devoted entirely to birds.

In 1545, Turner published &quot;The Rescuynge of the Romishe Fox&quot;, and in 1548, &quot;The Names of Herbes&quot;. In 1551, he published the first of three parts of his famous &quot;Herbal&quot;, on which his botanical fame rests.

&quot;&quot; (London: imprinted by Steven Myerdman and by John Gybken, 1551) is the first part of Turner&#x27;s great work; the second was published in 1562 and the third in 1568, both by Arnold Birckman of Cologne. These volumes gave the first clear, systematic survey of English plants, and with their admirable woodcuts (mainly copied from Leonhart Fuchs&#x27;s 1542 &quot;De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes&quot;) and detailed observations based on Turner&#x27;s own field studies put the herbal on an altogether higher footing than in earlier works. At the same time, however, Turner included an account of their &quot;uses and &quot;, and in his preface admits that some will accuse him of divulging to the general public what should have been reserved for a professional audience. For the first time, herbal was available in England in the vernacular, from which people could identify the main English plants without difficulty.

&quot;A New Book of Spiritual Physick&quot; was published in 1555. In 1562, Turner published the second part of his &quot;Herbal&quot;, dedicated to Sir Thomas Wentworth, son of the patron who had enabled him to go to Cambridge. This book was published by Arnold Birckman of Cologne, and included in the same binding Turner&#x27;s treatise on baths. The second volume includes one of the earliest reference to the celebrated Glastonbury Thorn, only five miles from Wells, which Turner tells us &quot;is grene all the wynter, as all they that dwell there about do stedfastly holde&quot;. The third and last part of Turner&#x27;s &quot;Herbal&quot; was published in 1568, in a volume that also contained revised editions of the first and second parts. This was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. He claimed that the herbal described only English plant species &quot;whereof is no mention made neither of ye old Grecianes nor Latines&quot;. &quot;A New Boke on the Natures and Properties of all Wines&quot;, also published in 1568, had pharmacological intent behind it, as also the included &quot;Treatise of Triacle&quot;.

As a member of the nonconformist faction in the Vestments controversy Turner was famous for making an adulterer do public penance wearing a square cap and for teaching his dog to steal such caps from bishop&#x27;s heads. His scholarly pursuits had other, distinctly political, implications. According to Tudor historian Lacey Baldwin Smith, for instance, &quot;Religious discontent and civil rebellion were obviously walking hand in hand when William Turner dared speak out against [Henry VIII&#x27;s] proclamation of 1543 limiting the reading of the Bible to men of social standing. What kind of ungodly belly wisdom was it, he demanded, to say that &#x27;rich men and the nobles are wiser than the poor people?&#x27;&quot;

Turner embraced the transmutation of species. Historian of science Charles E. Raven wrote that &quot;Turner, a shrewd observer and an excellent botanist, accepted transmutation as a commonplace event.&quot;

<text>The Louisiana Maneuvers were a series of major U.S. Army exercises held from August to September 1941 in northern and west-central Louisiana, an area bounded by the Sabine River to the west, the Calcasieu River to the east, and by the city of Shreveport to the north. The area included Fort Polk (now Fort Johnson), Camp Claiborne and Camp Livingston. The exercises, which involved some 400,000 troops, were designed to evaluate U.S. training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders. Similar U.S. Army field exercises carried out in the fall of 1941 included the Arkansas Maneuvers in August and the Carolina Maneuvers in November.

Many Army officers present at the maneuvers later rose to very senior roles in World War II, including Omar Bradley, Mark Clark, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Walter Krueger, Samuel E. Anderson, Lesley J. McNair, Joseph Stilwell, and George Patton.

==Background==

When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting World War II, the U.S. Army was largely an infantry force with supporting artillery, engineers, and cavalry, as well as combat support and combat service supporting arms. It was far smaller than most European armies, and few units were motorized or mechanized. As war approached, there was a need to both modernize and conduct large-scale maneuvers to test all aspects of a fast-growing, inexperienced force. General George C. Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, appointed General Lesley McNair as director of Army training. He and Colonel Mark Wayne Clark picked thousands of acres of unused land in Louisiana as a good place for large-scale training. The war games were conducted while the British awaited an expected German invasion of the United Kingdom, and some speculated that the National Guard units used in the maneuvers would not be demobilized afterwards.

==Exercises==

Around 400,000 troops were divided into equal armies of two fictitious countries: &quot;Kotmk&quot; (Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Kentucky), also called the Red Army; and &quot;Almat&quot; (Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee), or the Blue Army. The troops were organized into a total of 19 divisions.

From August to September 1941, the war game was conducted over of Louisiana. The area was bounded on the west by the Sabine River, on the east by the Calcasieu River, and on the north by the Red River at Shreveport. The two fictitious factions were &quot;at war&quot; over Mississippi River rights. There were two phases to the Louisiana Maneuvers. In Phase 1 of the exercise, both sides were given offensive missions. The Red 2nd Army would cross the Red River on September 15 and invade the Blue homeland. The Blue 3rd Army would move north to intercept the invaders and drive the Red force back across the river. In Phase 2, the Blue Army was both twice as large as the Red and equipped with its own armored division, the 2nd, which had switched sides since Phase 1. Blue&#x27;s mission was to advance upon and seize Shreveport, Louisiana. The Red force was much smaller and tasked largely with positional defense for a 100-mile zone south of the city. The Blue Army emerged victorious, due chiefly to General George S. Patton, who commanded the Blue 2nd Armored Division.

Omar Bradley, who participated in the exercises, later said that Louisianans welcomed the soldiers with open arms. Some soldiers even slept in some of the residents&#x27; houses. Bradley said it was so crowded in those houses sometimes when the soldiers were sleeping, there would hardly be any walking room. Bradley also said a few of the troops were disrespectful towards the residents&#x27; land and crops, and would tear down crops for extra food. However, for the most part, residents and soldiers established good relations.

During the exercises, 26 men died, most from drowning in the Sabine River or in vehicle accidents. One died when struck by lightning, and one had a heart attack at age 24.

This exercise also led to the creation of Fort Polk, named for the Confederate General Leonidas Polk, which was renamed to Fort Johnson on June 13, 2023.

==Lessons==
Built around a nucleus from Chaffee&#x27;s 7th Mechanized Cavalry, the 1st U.S. Armored Division tested the ability of a very large combined-arms mechanized unit to move long distances, maintain troops and vehicles in combat conditions, and affect the outcome of tactical and operational-level problems. The armored division concept was considered sound and led to the formation of 16 U.S. armored divisions during World War II.

U.S. defensive doctrine was based on the perceived need to defeat German blitzkrieg tactics; U.S. units expected to be faced with large numbers of German tanks attacking on relatively narrow fronts. The maneuvers tested the concept of the tank destroyer. This concept, originating with artillery officers, consisted of large numbers of highly mobile guns to be held in reserve. Upon an enemy tank attack, the towed or self-propelled tank destroyers would be rapidly deployed to the flanks of the penetration with the intent of taking a heavy toll of attacking tanks. Tank destroyers were supposed to employ aggressive, high-speed hit-and-run tactics against tanks. The use of these guns was distinct from the forward placement of towed antitank guns assigned as a normal part of the Infantry Regiment. The Louisiana Maneuvers&#x27; data showed that the Infantry&#x27;s AT guns took a much higher toll on &quot;enemy&quot; tanks than did the tank destroyer battalions&#x27; guns. However, the conclusion drawn was that a tank destroyer force of independent tank destroyer battalions should be raised.

In actual practice during World War II, such massed enemy tank attacks rarely happened; indeed, throughout the war only one TD battalion ever fought in an engagement quite like that which had originally been envisaged, at the Battle of El Guettar. The tank destroyer command eventually numbered over 100,000 men and 80 battalions equipped with 36 tank destroyers or towed anti-tank guns each. Immediately after the war, the force was disbanded and the anti-tank role was formally taken over by the Infantry, Engineer and Armor branches.

The exercise was also notable for the first wide-scale testing of the new C ration. Valuable data was obtained regarding weight of meals, composition and shape of can used. The resulting amendments produced the standard &quot;C&quot; field ration used by U.S ground forces for the bulk of World War II.

<doc id="376715" wikidata="Q17059313" url="?curid=376715" title="Dakota Wizards">
<text>The Dakota Wizards were an American professional basketball team based in Bismarck, North Dakota. They played in the NBA Development League from 2006 until 2012. After the 2011–12 season, the team relocated to Santa Cruz, California, and now plays as the Santa Cruz Warriors. Prior to entering the D-League in 2006, the Wizards spent 11 years playing in minor American leagues such as the International Basketball Association (IBA) and the Continental Basketball Association (CBA).

==History==
===Early years (1995–2006)===
The Wizards began play in 1995 in the International Basketball Association (IBA), and in 2001, with Dave Joerger at the helm, they won the IBA championship in the league&#x27;s final year of operation.

Following the 2000–01 season, the IBA merged with several teams from the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), and in their first year in the new CBA, Joerger and the Wizards won the league title, defeating the Rockford Lightning. After making it to the semifinals in the 2002–03 season, the Wizards again won the league title in 2004 over the Idaho Stampede, giving Joerger his third title as the Wizards&#x27; head coach.

Following the 2003–04 season, coach Joerger left the Wizards for a coaching opportunity with the Sioux Falls Skyforce. In his place, the Wizards appointed former assistant coach Casey Owens as head coach. The Wizards lost their opening two games against the Skyforce, but then cruised to a 12-game winning streak before losing to Sioux Falls on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2004. The Wizards also lost two potential all-stars, Billy Keys and Dickey Simpkins, who left the team mid-season to play overseas. The Wizards went on to clinch home court advantage throughout the 2005 playoffs with a league-best 32–16 record. Dakota split their first four playoff games with their first-round opponents, the Sioux Falls Skyforce, until Sioux Falls won Game 5 with a 102–97 victory, ending the Wizards&#x27; playoff run.

For the 2005–06 season, the Wizards replaced Casey Owens with former Baylor University head coach Dave Bliss. However, with the coaching change, the Wizards dropped from first in 2005 to out of the playoff race in 2006. Bliss resigned following the 2005–06 season, as season that saw the Wizards finish with a 19–29 record.

===First season in the D-League (2006–2007)===

In April 2006, the Wizards and three other teams (Colorado 14ers, Idaho Stampede and Sioux Falls Skyforce) withdrew from the CBA in order to join the emerging NBA Development League.

For their first season in the D-League, the Wizards brought back head coach Dave Joerger. Joerger guided the Wizards to a 33–17 record in 2006–07, good for the first seed in the Eastern Division. He went on to lead them to the Championship Game, where forward Darius Rice came off the bench to put together a record-setting night that led the Wizards to a 129–121 overtime victory over the Colorado 14ers. Rice scored 52 points and made 11 three-pointers, including one with 4.5 seconds left in regulation to send the game into overtime tied at 109. Rice&#x27;s points and three-point field goal totals set D-League championship game records.

===Steady decline (2007–2011)===
With the departure of the Dave Joerger following the 2006–07 season, having been hired by the Memphis Grizzlies as an assistant coach, the Wizards hired Duane Ticknor to replace him. In July 2007, the Wizards became affiliated with the Memphis Grizzlies and the Washington Wizards.

In 2007–08, the Wizards were again division champions, this time finishing as the first seed in the Central Division. They were, however, defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the arch rival, the Sioux Falls Skyforce. The Wizards continued to make the playoffs in 2008–09 and 2009–10, but with a missed playoff berth in 2010–11, the team missed the postseason for the first time since 2005–06, and just the second time since 1998–99. The Wizards concluded the 2010–11 season with a 19–31 record and in fourth place in the eight-team Eastern Conference.

===Warriors ownership and return to the playoffs (2011–2012)===
On June 28, 2011, the Golden State Warriors, led by Co-Executive Chairmen Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, purchased the Wizards franchise from Bismarck Professional Basketball LLC. The Warriors became the fourth NBA team to own and operate their own NBA D-League affiliate, joining San Antonio, Oklahoma City and the Los Angeles Lakers.

The Wizards remained in Bismarck during the 2011–12 season, but the Warriors were open to relocating the team to Northern California in 2012. To reflect the new ownership, the Wizards debuted with a new color scheme, the Warriors&#x27; blue and gold, used as an alternative to the purple and green, which dates back to their IBA days. The old color scheme was still used with the team&#x27;s road uniforms, while the blue and gold was used with the home uniforms and the logo. The Wizards were led by Edwin Ubiles in 2011–12, as he helped the team return to the playoffs with a 29–21 record. However, they were unable to move on past the first round following a 2–0 defeat at the hands of the Bakersfield Jam.

===Relocation===
Following intense off-season discussions regarding a move, on October 10, 2012, the Golden State Warriors announced that the Dakota Wizards would relocate to Santa Cruz beginning with the 2012–13 season. The team was subsequently renamed the Santa Cruz Warriors.

==Season By Season==
==Retired numbers==

<doc id="376716" wikidata="Q2204399" url="?curid=376716" title="Battle of Neville's Cross">
<text>The Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross took place during the Second War of Scottish Independence on 17 October 1346, half a mile (800 m) to the west of Durham, England. An invading Scottish army of 12,000 led by King David II was defeated with heavy loss by an English army of approximately 6,000–7,000 men led by Ralph Neville, Lord Neville. The battle was named after an Anglo-Saxon stone cross that stood on the hill where the Scots made their stand. After the victory, Neville paid to have a new cross erected to commemorate the day.

The battle was the result of the invasion of France by England during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. King Philip VI of France () called on the Scots to fulfil their obligation under the terms of the Auld Alliance and invade England. David II obliged, and after ravaging much of northern England was taken by surprise by the English defenders. The ensuing battle ended with the rout of the Scots, the capture of their king and the death or capture of most of their leadership. Strategically, this freed significant English resources for the war against France, and the English border counties were able to guard against the remaining Scottish threat from their own resources. The eventual ransoming of the Scottish King resulted in a truce that brought peace to the border for forty years.

==Background==
By 1346 England had been embroiled in the Second War of Scottish Independence since 1332 and the Hundred Years&#x27; War with France since 1337. In January 1343 the French and English had entered into the Truce of Malestroit, which included Scotland and was intended to last until 29 September 1346. In defiance of the truce, hostilities continued on all fronts, although mostly at a lower level; King David II of Scotland () led a six-day raid into northern England in October 1345. Edward III of England () planned an invasion of northern France in 1346 and King Philip VI of France sent an appeal to David II to open a northern front. Philip VI wanted the Scots to divert English troops, supplies and attention away from the army under Edward III which was gathering in southern England. The Auld Alliance between France and Scotland had been renewed in 1326 and was intended to deter England from attacking either country by the threat that in this case the other would invade English territory.

In June Philip VI asked David II to attack pre-emptively: &quot;I beg you, I implore you... Do for me what I would willingly do for you in such a crisis and do it as quickly... as you are able.&quot; Edward III landed in Normandy with an army of 15,000 in July. Philip VI renewed his pleas to David II. As the English had also committed troops to Gascony, Brittany and Flanders, Philip VI described northern England to David II as &quot;a defenceless void&quot;. David II felt certain that few English troops would be left to defend the rich northern English cities, but when the Scots probed into northern England they were sharply rebuffed by the local defenders. David II agreed to a truce, to last until 29 September, in order to fully mobilise the Scottish army, which was assembling at Perth. By the time the truce expired, the French had been decisively beaten at Crécy and the English were besieging Calais. The French were also in difficulty in south-west France, where their front had collapsed, with the major city and provincial capital of Poitiers, from the border of English Gascony, falling on 4 October.

== Prelude ==

On 7 October the Scots invaded England with approximately 12,000 men. Many had modern weapons and armour supplied by France. A small number of French knights marched alongside the Scots. It was described by both Scottish and English chroniclers of the time, and by modern historians, as the strongest and best-equipped Scottish expedition for many years. The border fort of Liddell Peel was stormed and captured after a siege of three days and the garrison massacred. Carlisle was bypassed in exchange for a large indemnity and the Scottish army moved east, ravaging the countryside as they went. They sacked Hexham Abbey, taking three days to do so, then advanced to Durham. They arrived outside Durham on 16 October and camped at Beaurepaire Priory, where the monks offered the Scots £1,000 (£ as of 2025) in protection money to be paid on 18 October.

The invasion had been expected by the English for some time; two years earlier the Chancellor of England had told parliament the Scots were &quot;saying quite openly that they will break the truce as soon as our adversary [France] desires and will march into England&quot;. Once the Scots invaded, an army was quickly mobilised at Richmond in north Yorkshire under the supervision of William de la Zouche, the Archbishop of York, who was Lord Warden of the Marches. It was not a large army: 3,000–4,000 men from the northern English counties of Cumberland, Northumberland and Lancashire; it is known that Lancashire contributed 1,200 longbowmen and a small number of lightly armed border cavalry, known as hobelars. Another 3,000 Yorkshiremen were en route to reinforce the English forces. This was possible because Edward III, when raising his army to invade France, had exempted the counties north of the River Humber. On 14 October, while the Scots were sacking Hexham Abbey, the Archbishop decided not to wait for the Yorkshire troops and marched north-west towards Barnard Castle, and then rapidly north-east to Durham. He was joined en route by the Yorkshire contingent, and Lord Ralph Neville took command of the combined force of 6,000–7,000 men.

== Battle ==

The Scots at Beaurepaire discovered the English army only on the morning of 17 October, when they were away. Around 500 men under William Douglas stumbled upon them in the morning mist during a raid near Merrington, south of Durham. The two rear divisions of the English army drove them off, with around 300 Scottish casualties. Douglas raced back to David II&#x27;s camp, alerting the rest of the army, which stood to arms. The same morning two Benedictine monks arrived from Durham in an attempt to broker a peace but David II, thinking they were spies, ordered their beheading; the monks escaped in the confusion.
David II led the Scottish army east from Beaurepaire to high ground less than half a mile (800 m) to the west of Durham and within sight of Durham Cathedral, where he prepared for battle. Both the Scots and the English arranged themselves in three formations, or battles. On the Scottish side, David II took control of the second battle, and placed John Randolph, Earl of Moray, in charge of the first battle. Patrick Dunbar, Earl of March, took command of the third battle. The contemporary sources are not consistent, but it seems the Scots formed up in their traditional schiltrons, each battle forming a rectilinear formation. The front ranks were armed with axes and long spears carried by the rear ranks protruded past them. The knights and other men-at-arms dismounted and stiffened the formations, usually at the very front. A screen of archers skirmished to the front, and each flank of the army was shielded by hobelars and further archers. As the mist lifted, it became clear the Scots were poorly positioned, on broken ground and with their movement made difficult by ditches and walls. They remembered their defeats at Dupplin Moor and Halidon Hill and so took a defensive stance, waiting for the English to attack.

The English similarly divided their forces with Lord Henry Percy, commanding their first battle; Neville their second; and the Archbishop of York their third. Neville remained in overall command. The English were entirely dismounted, with each battle having men-at-arms in the centre and longbowmen on each flank. The English also took a defensive stance, knowing they had the superior position and that time was on their side; their morale was high. The resulting stalemate lasted until the afternoon, when the English sent longbowmen forward to harass the Scottish lines. On the English left, the Scottish light horse and archers withdrew under the arrow fire and the English were able to shoot into the flank of Moray&#x27;s battle. The Earl of Menteith attempted to clear away the English archers with a cavalry charge, but this failed and he was taken prisoner. The archers succeeded in provoking the Scots into attacking.

Moray&#x27;s battle led the assault, but the broken terrain and obstacles slowed their advance and made it difficult for them to maintain formation. The longbowmen were able to fall back behind their men-at-arms. By the time the disorganised battle came to hand-to-hand combat it was easily dealt with. Seeing their first attack repulsed, and also being harassed by the English archers, the third and largest Scottish battle, on the Scottish left under the Earl of March and Robert Stewart, broke and fled, with most escaping. The English stood off from the remaining Scots under David II and poured in arrows. The English men-at-arms then attacked and after fighting described as &quot;ferocious&quot;, the Scots attempted unsuccessfully to retreat and were routed. The English men-at-arms outfought superior numbers of the Scottish foot, while the performance of the English archers was mixed. Most of them were participating in their first pitched battle, or even their first combat. Many groups of bowmen conspicuously hung back, while the Lancashire longbowmen received a post-battle bonus of £10 each (£ in 2025 terms).

David II, badly wounded, was captured after he fled the field, while the rest of the Scottish army was pursued by the English long into the night. More than 50 Scottish barons were killed or captured; Scotland lost almost all its military leadership. The Scottish dead included: the Constable, Lord David de la Hay; the Marischal, Robert de Keith; the Chamberlain, John de Roxburgh; the Chancellor, Lord Thomas Charteris; two earls, John Randolph, Earl of Moray and Maurice de Moravia, Earl of Strathearn; and Niall Bruce of Carrick, an illegitimate son of Robert the Bruce. An unknown number of Scots were taken prisoner. It is believed that only Scots thought able to pay a ransom were spared, others being slain out of hand. Scottish nobles who were captured included William Douglas, the &quot;Knight of Liddesdale&quot;, their most skilled guerilla fighter, and four earls.

Scottish chroniclers Andrew of Wyntoun and Walter Bower both wrote that a thousand Scots were killed in the battle, while the Chronicle of Lanercost said &quot;few English were killed&quot;. Modern historians Given-Wilson and Bériac have estimated that some 3,000 Scotsmen perished and fewer than a hundred were taken prisoner.

== Aftermath ==

Accounts of the time state that after the battle David II was hiding under a bridge over the River Browney when his reflection was seen in the water by a group of English soldiers. David II was then taken prisoner by John de Coupland, who was leading the detachment and had two teeth knocked out by the King. During the battle David II had been twice shot in the face with arrows. Surgeons attempted to remove the arrows but the tip of one remained lodged in his face, rendering him prone to headaches for decades. Edward III ordered David II to be handed over to him, rewarding Coupland with a knighthood and an annuity of £500 for life (£ per year in 2025 terms).
Despite having fled without fighting, Robert Stewart was appointed Lord Guardian to act on David II&#x27;s behalf in his absence.

All the Scottish captives were ordered to London, to the disgust of their captors who had a legal right to ransom them. A significant number of Scottish prisoners were privately ransomed, their captors subsequently attempting to deny they had been taken, which outraged Edward III. Edward III refused to ransom any of those who were passed on to him, or release them on parole as was traditional; he wished to cripple the Scottish capacity to make war for as long as possible, by depriving them of their leaders. In at least some cases, he paid considerable sums to their captors to buy out their ransom rights. John Graham, Earl of Menteith, had previously sworn fealty to Edward III, who considered him guilty of treason. On the King&#x27;s direct orders, he was tried, condemned and then drawn, hanged, beheaded and quartered.

In early 1347, two English forces made large-scale raids deep into Scotland. They met little opposition and devastated much of southern Scotland. Border raids, often accompanied by devastation of the countryside, and sometimes on a large scale, continued to be launched by both the Scots and the English. The battle removed the strategic threat to Edward III&#x27;s rear, and by 1349 the English border counties were able to guard against the remaining Scottish threat from their own resources.

The Black Rood of Scotland, venerated as a piece of the True Cross, and previously belonging to the former queen of Scotland, Saint Margaret of Scotland, was taken from David II and donated to the shrine of Saint Cuthbert in Durham Cathedral. On three separate occasions, Edward III offered to release the childless David II for £40,000 (approximately £ million in 2025 terms) if the latter would accept one of Edward III&#x27;s sons as his heir to the Scottish throne. All three offers were refused. Eleven years after the battle, David II was released in exchange for a ransom of 100,000 marks (approximately £ million in 2025 terms). The ransom was to be paid over ten years, on 24 June (St. John the Baptist&#x27;s Day) each year, during which an Anglo-Scottish truce prohibited any Scottish citizen from bearing arms against Edward III or any of his men and the English were supposed to stop attacking Scotland. This truce lasted for four decades and marked the end of the Second War of Scottish Independence although intermittent fighting continued.

The battle takes its name from an Anglo-Saxon boundary marker in the form of a cross which was located on the ridge where the battle was fought; and from Lord Ralph Neville, the leader of the victorious English. Lord Neville paid to have a replacement cross erected to commemorate the day; this was destroyed in 1589. A wooden cross erected on Maiden&#x27;s Bower to commemorate the victory stood until 1569. The site of the battle has been listed as a registered battlefield by Historic England.

== In literature ==

The fate of King David II is recalled in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry V&quot;. In Act 1 Scene 3, Henry discusses the Scottish invasion with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The last lines refer to an earlier play which should have been known to Shakespeare&#x27;s audience, &quot;The Reign of Edward III&quot;. At the end of the latter play, John de Coupland brings the captured David II to Edward III in Calais, where he meets the Black Prince, who has captured the French king.

<text>Biddulph Recordings is a record label based in Devon, England specialising in the restoration of historical performances, particularly by string musicians. It was founded in 1989 by violin dealer Peter Biddulph and Eric Wen, a musicologist and historian of string performances. In 2003, Sarah Woodward joined and has since overseen the historical vocal label Romophone. Biddulph Recordings’ honours include the Gramophone 1999 ICRC award for &quot;Historical Recording of the Year&quot;.

==Historic reissues==
The early Biddulph titles included the first digital reissues of recordings by Fritz Kreisler, Joseph Szigeti, Jacques Thibaud, and Yehudi Menuhin. By the mid-1990s, Biddulph Recordings had also released complete editions of Bronisław Huberman, Mischa Elman, Jan Kubelík, Henri Temianka, Toscha Seidel, Ossy Renardy, Lionel Tertis, William Primrose, Pablo Casals, and Ruggiero Ricci. The Biddulph label soon include historical piano recordings, with the first digital reissues of recordings by Alfred Cortot, Harold Bauer, and Percy Grainger, followed by Myra Hess, Moriz Rosenthal, Raoul Koczalski, Wilhelm Backhaus, and Shura Cherkassky. Biddulph later branched into historical orchestral and chamber music, reissuing the work of Willem Mengelberg, Serge Koussevitzky, Leopold Stokowski, Thomas Beecham, Max Fiedler, and Hermann Abendroth, as well as the Budapest String Quartet, the Busch Quartet, the Capet Quartet, and the Primrose Quartet.

==Original recordings==
Biddulph Recordings has also produced a number of important original recordings. The first of these was the recital recording debut of violinist Maxim Vengerov, then an unknown 14-year-old prodigy. This was followed by Ruggiero Ricci’s accounts of the Beethoven and Brahms Concertos featuring 16 and 14 different cadenzas respectively (both concerto albums were tracked to enable the listener to choose which cadenza to program into each performance). Other new recordings on the Biddulph label include the Bach interpretations of pianist Edward Aldwell, and the violin performances of Oscar Shumsky, Aaron Rosand, and Arnold Steinhardt.

<text>The Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) was a scientific research establishment within the Ministry of Defence (MoD) of the United Kingdom. It was located primarily at Malvern in Worcestershire, England. The RSRE motto was &quot;Ubique Sentio&quot; (Latin for &quot;I sense everywhere&quot;).

== History ==
RSRE was formed in 1976 by an amalgamation of previous research organizations; these included the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE), itself derived from the World War II-era Telecommunications Research Establishment, the Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE) in Christchurch, Dorset, and the Services Electronic Research Laboratory (SERL) at Baldock.

Beginning in 1979, the SRDE and SERL moved to Malvern to join the RRE&#x27;s location. There were several out-stations in Worcestershire, including the ex-RAF airfields at Defford and Pershore and the satellite tracking station at Sheriffs Lench.

In April 1991 RSRE amalgamated with other defence research establishments to form the Defence Research Agency, which in April 1995 amalgamated with more organisations to form the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency.
In June 2001 this became independent of the MoD, with approximately two-thirds of it being incorporated into QinetiQ, a commercial company owned by the MoD, and the remainder into the fully government-owned laboratory DSTL. In 2003 the Carlyle Group bought a private equity stake (~30%) in QinetiQ.

== Research ==

Some of the most important technologies developed from work at RSRE are radar, satellite communications, thermography, liquid crystal displays, speech synthesis and the Touchscreen.

Predecessor organisation Signals Research and Development Establishment (SRDE) had been involved in the development of military communications satellites, within the U.S. Interim Defense Communication Satellite Program (IDCSP) and the development of the British Skynet 1 and 2 satellite types. The SRDE establishment moved to a RSRE facility at RAF Defford near Malvern in 1980, which had the benefit of flat terrain for good satellite dish positioning and the nearby Bredon Hill for satellite simulators. RSRE was involved in the design and testing of Skynet 4 and its ground facilities and terminals.

Contributions to computer science made by the RSRE included ALGOL 68RS (a portable implementation of ALGOL 68, following on from ALGOL 68R developed by RRE), Coral 66, radial basis function networks, hierarchical self-organising networks (deep autoencoders), the VIPER high-integrity microprocessor, the ELLA hardware description language, and the TenDRA C/C++ compiler.

RSRE was an early researcher of TCP/IP in Europe, along with Peter Kirstein&#x27;s group at University College London and NDRE in Norway. The first email sent by a head of state was sent from the RSRE over the ARPANET by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 March 1976. RSRE was allocated class A Internet net 25 in 1979, which later became the Ministry of Defence address space, providing 16.7 million IPv4 addresses.

<text>James Sheridan Knowles (12 May 1784 – 30 November 1862) was an Irish dramatist and actor. A relative of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Knowles enjoyed success writing plays for the leading West End theatres. Later in his career he also produced several novels.

==Early life==

Knowles was born in Cork. His father was the lexicographer James Knowles, cousin of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. The family moved to London in 1793, and at the age of fourteen Knowles published a ballad entitled &quot;The Welsh Harper&quot;, which, set to music, was very popular. His talents secured him the friendship of William Hazlitt, who introduced him to Charles Lamb and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. He served for some time in the Wiltshire and afterwards in the Tower Hamlets militia, leaving the service to become a pupil of Dr Robert Willan (1757–1812). He obtained the degree of M.D., and was appointed vaccinator to the Jennerian Society.

==Literary career==
Although Dr Willan offered him a share in his practice, Knowles decided to give up medicine for the stage, making his first appearance as an actor probably at Bath, and played Hamlet at Crow Street Theatre, Dublin. At Wexford he married, in October 1809, Maria Charteris, an actress from the Edinburgh Theatre. In 1810 he wrote &quot;Leo&quot;, a successful play in which Edmund Kean appeared; another play, &quot;Brian Boroihme&quot;, written for the Belfast Theatre in the next year, attracted crowds; nevertheless, Knowles&#x27;s earnings were so small that he was obliged to become assistant to his father at the Belfast Academical Institution. In 1817 he moved from Belfast to Glasgow, where, besides keeping a flourishing school, he continued to write for the stage.

His first important success was &quot;Caius Gracchus&quot;, produced at the Belfast Theatre in 1815; and his &quot;Virginius&quot;, written for William Charles Macready, was first performed in 1820 at Covent Garden. In &quot;William Tell&quot; (1825), Knowles wrote for Macready one of his favourite parts. His best-known play, &quot;The Hunchback&quot;, was produced at Covent Garden in 1832, and Knowles won praise acting in the work as Master Walter. &quot;The Wife&quot; was brought out at the same theatre in 1833; &quot;The Daughter&quot; better known as &quot;The Wrecker&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; in 1836, and &quot;The Love Chase&quot; in 1837. His 1839 play &quot;Love&quot; was praised by Mary Shelley for its &quot;inspiring situations founded on sentiment and passion&quot;. His second wife was the actress Emma Knowles.

==Later life==

In his later years he forsook the stage for the pulpit, and as a Baptist preacher attracted large audiences at Exeter Hall and elsewhere. He published two polemical works: the &quot;Rock of Rome&quot; and the &quot;Idol Demolished by Its Own Priests&quot; in both of which he combated the special doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Knowles was for some years in the receipt of an annual pension of £200, bestowed by Sir Robert Peel in 1849. In old age he befriended the young Edmund Gosse, whom he introduced to Shakespeare. Knowles makes a happy appearance in Gosse&#x27;s &quot;Father and Son&quot;.

He died at Torquay on 30 November 1862. He is buried under a huge tomb at the summit of the Glasgow Necropolis.

==Bibliography==

A full list of the works of Knowles and of the various notices of him will be found in &quot;The Life of James Sheridan Knowles&quot; (1872), privately printed by his son, Richard Brinsley Knowles (1820–1882), who was well known as a journalist. It was translated into German.

<text>Burnley Football Club () is a professional football club based in Burnley, Lancashire, England. The club competes in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football, following relegation from the Premier League in 2023–24. Founded in 1882, Burnley were one of the first to become professional (in 1883) and subsequently put pressure on the Football Association to permit payments to players. They entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1885–86 and were one of the 12 founder members of the Football League in 1888–89. Burnley were the second, and are one of only five sides to have won all four professional divisions of English football.

Burnley have been champions of England twice, in 1920–21 and 1959–60, have won the FA Cup once, in 1913–14, and have won the FA Charity Shield twice, in 1960 and 1973. They have been runners-up in the First Division twice, in 1919–20 and 1961–62, and FA Cup runners-up twice, in 1946–47 and 1961–62. During the 1920–21 season, Burnley embarked on a 30-match unbeaten league run, setting an English record. From the 1950s until the 1970s, under chairman Bob Lord, Burnley became renowned for their youth policy and scouting system, and were one of the first to set up a purpose-built training ground. When the team won the 1959–60 Football League, the town of Burnley—with 80,000 inhabitants—became one of the smallest to have an English first-tier champion.

The team have played home games at Turf Moor since 1883, after they had moved from their original premises at Calder Vale. The club colours of claret and blue were adopted before the 1910–11 season in tribute to the then Football League champions Aston Villa. The club is nicknamed &quot;The Clarets&quot; because of the dominant colour of its home shirts. Burnley&#x27;s current emblem is based on the town&#x27;s coat of arms. The team have a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Blackburn Rovers, with whom they contest the East Lancashire Derby. Burnley&#x27;s record appearance holder is Jerry Dawson, who made 569 appearances in a 22-year playing spell with the team, and their record goalscorer is George Beel with 188 goals.

== History ==

=== Beginnings and the first major honours (1882–1946) ===

The club was founded on 18 May 1882 by members of rugby team Burnley Rovers, who voted for a shift to association football, since several other sports clubs in the area had changed their codes to football. The suffix &quot;Rovers&quot; was dropped a few days later. The side won their first silverware in 1883: the Dr Dean&#x27;s Cup, a knockout competition between amateur clubs in the Burnley area. By the end of the year, the club turned professional and signed many Scottish players. Burnley refused to join the Football Association (FA) and its FA Cup, since the association barred professional players. In 1884, Burnley led a group of 35 other clubs in the formation of the breakaway British Football Association (BFA) to challenge the FA&#x27;s supremacy. The FA changed its rule in 1885, allowing professionalism, and Burnley made their first appearance in the FA Cup in 1885–86. In October 1886, Burnley&#x27;s Turf Moor became the first professional ground to be visited by a member of the Royal Family, when Prince Albert Victor attended a friendly between Burnley and Bolton Wanderers. The club was among the twelve founders of the Football League in 1888–89 and one of the six based in Lancashire. In the second match, William Tait became the first player in history to score a league hat-trick, when his three goals gave Burnley their inaugural win in the competition. In 1889–90, they claimed their first Lancashire Cup, after beating local rivals Blackburn Rovers in the final.

Burnley were relegated to the Second Division for the first time in 1896–97. The team won the division the next season; only two of thirty matches were lost before promotion was gained through a four-team play-off series called test matches, although the last game against First Division club Stoke was controversial. The tie finished 0–0 as both needed only a draw for a top flight place; it was later named &quot;[t]he match without a shot at goal&quot;. Burnley were relegated again in 1899–1900 and found themselves at the centre of controversy when their goalkeeper, Jack Hillman, attempted to bribe opponents Nottingham Forest in the last match of the season. It is possibly the earliest recorded case of match fixing in football. The side continued to play in the Second Division and even finished in bottom place in 1902–03—but were re-elected—as the club got into financial difficulties.
Harry Windle was named chairman in 1909, after which the club&#x27;s finances turned around. The directors appointed John Haworth as the new manager in 1910, who changed the club&#x27;s colours from green to the claret and blue of Aston Villa, the then First Division champions, as Haworth and the Burnley committee believed it might bring a change of fortune. In 1912–13, the side won promotion to the first tier; the following season, Burnley won their first major honour, beating Liverpool in the 1914 FA Cup final. Bert Freeman scored the only goal, as Burnley became the first club to defeat five top tier sides in one cup season. Tommy Boyle became the first captain to receive the trophy from a reigning monarch, King George V. The team finished second to West Bromwich Albion in 1919–20, before winning their first ever First Division championship in 1920–21. Burnley lost the opening three games but went unbeaten in the following 30 league matches, setting an English record. Nine seasons later, the team were relegated to the Second Division. They struggled in the second tier and avoided a further relegation in 1931–32 by two points. The years through to the outbreak of the Second World War were characterised by mid-table league finishes.

=== Progressive and golden era (1946–1976) ===
In the first season of post-war League football, Burnley gained promotion and reached the 1947 FA Cup final but were defeated by Charlton Athletic after extra time. The team&#x27;s defence was nicknamed &quot;The Iron Curtain&quot;, since they only conceded 29 goals in 42 league matches. Alan Brown was appointed manager in 1954, and Bob Lord chairman a year later. The club became one of the most progressive around under their tenures. Burnley were one of the first to set up a purpose-built training ground, at Gawthorpe, and they became renowned for their youth policy and scouting system, which yielded many young talents. In 1958, former Burnley player Harry Potts was appointed manager. His squad mainly revolved around the duo of captain Jimmy Adamson and Jimmy McIlroy, the team&#x27;s playmaker. Potts often employed the then unfashionable 4–4–2 formation and he implemented a Total Football playing style.
Burnley clinched a second First Division title in 1959–60. They had not topped the table until the last match was played out. The squad cost only £13,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025) in transfer fees—£8,000 on McIlroy in 1950 and £5,000 on left-back Alex Elder in 1959. The other players came from their youth academy. With 80,000 inhabitants, the town of Burnley became one of the smallest to have an English first tier champion. They travelled to the United States after the season ended to represent England in the International Soccer League, the first modern international American soccer tournament. The following season, Burnley played in European competition for the first time in the 1960–61 European Cup. They defeated former finalists Reims in the first round, but went out against Hamburger SV in the quarter-finals. The team finished the 1961–62 First Division as runners-up to newcomers Ipswich Town after winning only one of the last ten matches, and had a run to the 1962 FA Cup final but lost against Tottenham Hotspur. Adamson was named FWA Footballer of the Year, however, with McIlroy as runner-up.

The maximum wage in the Football League was abolished in 1961, which meant that clubs from small towns like Burnley could no longer compete financially with sides from bigger towns and cities. The controversial departure of McIlroy to Stoke City in 1963 and Adamson&#x27;s retirement in 1964 also damaged the club&#x27;s fortunes. Burnley retained their place in the First Division throughout the decade, however, finishing third in 1965–66 to qualify for the 1966–67 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Potts was replaced by Adamson as manager in 1970. Adamson hailed his squad as the &quot;Team of the Seventies&quot;, but he was unable to halt the slide as relegation followed in 1970–71. Burnley won the Second Division title in 1972–73, and were invited to play in the 1973 FA Charity Shield, where they emerged as winners against Manchester City. In 1975, the team were victims of one of the great FA Cup shocks of all time when Wimbledon, then in the Southern League, won 1–0 at Turf Moor. Adamson left the club in January 1976, and relegation from the First Division followed later that year. During this period, a drop in home attendances combined with an enlarged debt forced Burnley to sell star players such as Martin Dobson and Leighton James, which caused a rapid decline.

=== Near oblivion and recovery (1976–2020) ===

The team were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in 1979–80. Under the management of former Burnley player Brian Miller, they returned to the second tier as champions in 1981–82. However, this return was short-lived and lasted only one year. Managerial changes continued to be made in a search for success; Miller was replaced by Frank Casper in early 1983, he by John Bond before the 1983–84 season and Bond himself by John Benson a season later. Bond was the first manager since Frank Hill (1948–1954) without a previous playing career at the club. He was criticised by the fans for signing expensive players increasing Burnley&#x27;s debt, and for selling the young talents Lee Dixon, Brian Laws and Trevor Steven. Benson was in charge when Burnley were relegated to the Fourth Division for the first time at the end of the 1984–85 season. The team avoided relegation to the Football Conference, the highest level of non-League football, on the last day in 1986–87, after they won against Orient and their rivals drew or lost.
In 1988, Burnley played Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final of the Associate Members&#x27; Cup but lost 2–0. The match was attended by 80,000 people, a record for a match between two sides from the fourth tier. The team won the Fourth Division in 1991–92 under manager Jimmy Mullen. He had succeeded Casper in October 1991 and won his first nine league matches as manager. By winning the fourth tier, Burnley became only the second club to win all four professional divisions of English football, after Wolverhampton Wanderers. Burnley won the Second Division play-offs in 1993–94 and gained promotion to the second tier. Relegation followed after one season, and in 1997–98 only a last-day victory over Plymouth Argyle prevented relegation back into the fourth tier. Under manager Stan Ternent, Burnley finished second in 1999–2000 and won promotion to the second tier. In early 2002, financial problems caused by the collapse of ITV Digital brought the club close to administration. Ternent was sacked in 2004, after he avoided relegation with a squad composed of several loaned players and some players who were not entirely fit. The 2008–09 campaign, with Owen Coyle in charge, ended with promotion to the Premier League. Sheffield United were defeated in the Championship play-off final, which meant a return to the top flight after 33 years. Burnley also reached the semi-final of the League Cup for the first time in over 25 years but were beaten on aggregate by Tottenham in the last minutes of the second leg.
Promotion made the town of Burnley one of the smallest to host a Premier League club. The team started the season well and became the first newly promoted side in the competition to win their first four home games. However, Coyle left the club in January 2010 to manage local rivals Bolton Wanderers. He was replaced by former Burnley player Brian Laws, but the team&#x27;s form plummeted and they were relegated after a single season. Sean Dyche was appointed manager in October 2012. In his first full season in charge, Dyche guided Burnley back to the Premier League in 2013–14 on a tight budget and with a small squad. The team went down after one season but won the Championship title on their return in 2015–16, ending the season with a run of 23 league games undefeated. In 2017, the club completed construction of Barnfield Training Centre—the replacement of Gawthorpe—with Dyche being involved in the training ground&#x27;s design. Burnley finished seventh in 2017–18, which meant qualification for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League and a return to European football after 51 years. The team failed to reach the group stage, as they were eliminated in the play-off round by Greek club Olympiacos.

=== Foreign owners (2020–present) ===
In December 2020, American investment company ALK Capital acquired an 84% stake in Burnley for £170 million. It was the first time the club was run by anyone other than local businessmen and Burnley supporters. In 2021–22, Burnley were relegated back to the Championship after they lost on the final matchday and finished in 18th place. In June 2022, the Belgian Vincent Kompany was appointed Burnley&#x27;s manager, becoming the first person from outside the British Isles to manage the club. During his first months in charge, he signed 16 players—mostly young and foreign—as he rebuilt the squad on a budget. Kompany also implemented a possession-based, attacking style of play. Burnley secured promotion back to the Premier League with seven matches remaining—a Championship record—before winning the Championship title following a 1–0 victory at local rivals Blackburn Rovers. The following season, Burnley were relegated again from the Premier League, finishing 19th with a club record low tally of 24 points. Kompany was criticised for mainly buying inexperienced players, resulting in an uncompetitive squad, and for his &quot;tactical naivety&quot; and &quot;stubbornness&quot;. Shortly afterwards, however, Kompany went to Bayern Munich for a fee of £10.2 million, which made him one of the most expensive managers in history.

== Club identity ==
=== Kits and colours ===
In the early years, Burnley used various kit designs and colours. Throughout the first eight years, there were various permutations of blue and white, the colours of the club&#x27;s forerunners Burnley Rovers. Before the start of the 1890–91 season, the club adopted an all-blue shirt, but changed it to all-white mid-season. After several years of claret and amber stripes, for much of the mid-1890s a combination of black with amber was used, although the team wore a shirt with pink and white stripes during the 1894–95 season. Between 1897 and 1900, the club used an all-red shirt and from 1900 until 1910 it wore an all-green jersey. In 1910, Burnley changed their colours to claret and blue, which they have had for most of their history, save for a spell in white shirts during the second half of the 1930s and the Second World War. The adoption of the claret and blue combination paid homage to Football League champions Aston Villa, who wore those colours. Burnley&#x27;s committee and manager John Haworth believed it might bring a change of fortune. The club decided to re-register its colours as claret and blue in 1946, partly due to readers&#x27; letters to the &quot;Burnley Express&quot;.

Burnley&#x27;s jerseys were manufactured by local companies until 1975, when Umbro became the first to have its logo on the club&#x27;s shirt. Since 1975, the team have had a variety of kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors. The club&#x27;s first kit sponsor was POCO in 1982, while the mobile game &quot;Golf Clash&quot; became its first sleeve sponsor in 2017.

=== Crest ===

Burnley&#x27;s first use of a crest was in December 1887, when they wore the royal arms on the shirt. Prince Albert Victor had watched the team play against Bolton Wanderers at Turf Moor in October 1886—the first visit to a professional football ground by a member of the royal family. To commemorate the visit, the club received a set of white jerseys featured with a blue sash and embellished with the royal coat of arms. The crest was regularly worn on the shirts until 1895, when it disappeared. During the 1914 FA Cup final, watched by King George V, it featured again on the kits. From 1914, the team played in unadorned shirts, although they wore the coat of arms of Burnley during the 1934–35 FA Cup semi-final and the 1947 FA Cup final. After winning the First Division in 1960, Burnley were allowed to wear the town&#x27;s crest on their shirts. From 1969 to 1975, the team bore the letters &quot;BFC&quot; running downwards from left to right. In 1975, the club adopted a horizontal &quot;BFC&quot; cypher lettered in gold. Burnley used a designed badge with elements from the town and the club on their home shirts from 1979, before they adopted a simple horizontal &quot;B.F.C.&quot; in 1983, lettered in white. In 1987, the club reinstated the crest used from 1979 to 1983. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1959–60 First Division title win in 2009, Burnley reintroduced the logo used from 1960 to 1969. The following season, its Latin motto &quot;Pretiumque et Causa Laboris&quot; () was replaced with the inscription &quot;Burnley Football Club&quot;. In 2023, Burnley coloured the elements in white and placed them on a claret shield; from the 2024–25 season, the crest appeared on the club&#x27;s home kits.

The club&#x27;s current badge is based on the town&#x27;s coat of arms. The stork at the top of the crest refers to the Starkie family, who were prominent in the Burnley area. In its mouth it holds a Lacy knot, of the de Lacy family, who held Burnley in the Middle Ages. The stork stands on a hill and cotton plants—which represents the town&#x27;s cotton heritage. Beneath, the hand represents the town&#x27;s motto &quot;Hold to the Truth&quot;, derived from the Towneley family. The two bees refer to the town&#x27;s hard work ethic, while the lion represents royalty. The chevron is a reference to the River Brun, which runs through the town.

== Stadium ==

The team have played their home games at Turf Moor since February 1883, which replaced their original premises at Calder Vale. The Turf Moor site has been used for sport since at least 1843, when Burnley Cricket Club moved to the area. In 1883, they invited Burnley to a field adjacent to the cricket pitch. Both clubs have remained there since, and only Lancashire rivals Preston North End have continuously occupied their stadium—Deepdale—for longer.

The ground originally consisted of only a pitch and the initial grandstand was not built until 1885. In 1888, the first league match at Turf Moor saw Burnley emerge as 4–1 winners over Bolton Wanderers, Fred Poland netting the first league goal at the stadium. Turf Moor&#x27;s capacity was increased to 50,000 under the chairman Harry Windle during the 1910s. The ground hosted its only FA Cup semi-final in 1922, between Huddersfield Town and Notts County, and five years later it hosted its only full international match, between England and Wales for the British Home Championship. From the end of the Second World War until the mid-1960s, crowds in the stadium averaged in the 20,000–35,000 range, and Burnley averaged a club-record attendance of 33,621 in the 1947–48 First Division. The attendance record for a single match was already set in 1924 against Huddersfield Town in an FA Cup third round tie, when 54,775 spectators attended. In 1960, in an FA Cup fifth round replay game against Bradford City, there was an official attendance of 52,850. Some of the gates were broken down, however, and many uncounted fans poured into the ground.

Turf Moor has a capacity of 21,944 and consists of four stands: the North Stand (formerly the Longside), the Jimmy McIlroy Stand (formerly the Bee Hole End), the Bob Lord Stand, and the Cricket Field Stand for home and away fans. Turf Moor&#x27;s field had a slope until 1974, when the pitch was raised to minimise it. During the mid-1990s, the ground underwent further refurbishment when the Longside and Bee Hole End terraces were replaced by all-seater stands as a result of the Taylor Report. In 2019, the club built two corner stands for disabled home supporters between the Jimmy McIlroy and both the North and Bob Lord Stands to meet the Accessible Stadium Guide regulations.

== Supporters and rivalries ==
=== Supporters ===
Burnley&#x27;s supporters are mainly drawn from East Lancashire and West Yorkshire. The club is one of the best supported sides in English football per capita, with average attendances of around 21,000 in the Premier League in a town of approximately 78,000 inhabitants. Burnley have numerous supporters&#x27; clubs across the United Kingdom and overseas. The club&#x27;s fans have had a long-standing friendship with supporters of the Dutch team Helmond Sport since the 1990s. Several Burnley and Helmond fans regularly make an overseas journey to visit each other&#x27;s matches. For 2022–23 and 2023–24, Helmond Sport adopted a claret and blue away kit in tribute to Burnley.

A frequently sung chant since the early 1970s is &quot;No Nay Never&quot;, an adaptation of the song &quot;The Wild Rover&quot;, which has lyrics to offend main rivals Blackburn Rovers. In the early 1980s, a hooligan firm known as the Suicide Squad emerged from within Burnley&#x27;s fanbase. The group later featured on the 2006 hooligan documentary series &quot;The Real Football Factories&quot;. In 2011, 12 members were sentenced to jail for a total of 32 years, after a high-profile incident with Blackburn Rovers supporters in 2009. The firm disbanded after the verdict.

Notable Burnley fans have included football pioneer Jimmy Hogan, who was a regular attendee at Turf Moor; journalist Alastair Campbell, who has been regularly involved in events with the club; and cricketer James Anderson, who also worked in Burnley&#x27;s ticket office on a part-time basis. King Charles III is also a supporter of the club, as is the South African cardinal Wilfrid Napier. In 2019, Burnley fan Scott Cunliffe was honoured by the UEFA with the #EqualGame Award &quot;for his work as a role model highlighting diversity, inclusion and accessibility in football&quot;; he ran to every away Premier League ground during Burnley&#x27;s 2018–19 campaign and raised more than £55,000 for Premier League clubs&#x27; community trusts and community projects in Burnley.

A popular drink served at home matches since the First World War is &quot;Béné &amp; Hot&quot;—the French liqueur Bénédictine topped up with hot water. The East Lancashire Regiment soldiers acquired a taste for the drink while stationed at the birthplace of the beverage in Fécamp, Normandy, during the war. They drank it with hot water to keep warm in the trenches, and the surviving soldiers later returned to the East Lancashire area with the liqueur. In excess of 30 bottles are sold at each home game, which makes the club one of the world&#x27;s biggest sellers of Bénédictine; Turf Moor is the only British football ground to sell it.

=== Rivalries ===
Burnley&#x27;s main rivals are Blackburn Rovers, with whom they contest the East Lancashire derby, named after the region both clubs hail from. Games between these sides from mill towns are also known under the name &quot;Cotton Mills derby&quot;. Both are founder members of the Football League and have won the First Division and the FA Cup. The two clubs are separated by only and besides the geographical proximity, they also have a long-standing history of rivalry; the earliest competitive clash was a Football League match in 1888. Four years earlier, however, they had met for the first time in a friendly, &quot;with considerable pride at stake&quot;. Burnley hold the better head-to-head record, as the side have won 45 games to Blackburn&#x27;s 41. Burnley&#x27;s closest geographic rivals are actually Accrington Stanley, but as they have never competed at the same level—although defunct club Accrington did—there is no significant rivalry between them.

Other rivalries include those with nearby clubs Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers and Preston North End. Burnley also share a Roses rivalry with West Yorkshire sides Bradford City and Leeds United. The team contested heated matches with Halifax Town, Plymouth Argyle, Rochdale and Stockport County in the 1980s and 1990s during their time in the lower leagues, although feelings of animosity were mainly one-sided; according to the Football Fans Census in 2003, Halifax and Stockport supporters considered Burnley to be their main rivals.

=== Managers ===

Burnley-born Harry Bradshaw was Burnley&#x27;s first manager—he was appointed in August 1894—and was the first to win a league title with the club, taking them to the top of the Second Division at the end of the 1897–98 season. John Haworth was the first manager in the club&#x27;s history to win a major honour, the FA Cup in 1914; under Haworth, Burnley also became champions of England for the first time in 1920–21. Harry Potts led the club to its second First Division title during the 1959–60 campaign. Jimmy Adamson (1972–73 Second Division), Brian Miller (1981–82 Third Division), Jimmy Mullen (1991–92 Fourth Division), Sean Dyche (2015–16 Football League Championship), and Vincent Kompany (2022–23 EFL Championship) also led Burnley to league titles.

=== Owners ===
In 1897, the club incorporated as a limited company. From their establishment until 2020, Burnley were run by local businessmen and supporters. In December 2020, Velocity Sports Partners (VSP), the sports investment arm of American management firm ALK Capital, acquired an 84% stake in Burnley for £170 million. Alan Pace, managing partner of ALK Capital, subsequently replaced Mike Garlick as the club&#x27;s chairman. ALK borrowed much of the takeover money, and the loan debts were transferred to the club. As a result of this leveraged takeover, Burnley went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of around £100 million, at interest rates of about eight per cent.

In May 2023, J. J. Watt, a retired defensive end in American football&#x27;s National Football League, and his wife, former United States women&#x27;s national soccer team international Kealia Watt, were announced as new minority investors. In August 2023, YouTube group Dude Perfect also became minority investors in the club.

== Records and statistics ==
The record for the most first team appearances in all competitions for Burnley is held by goalkeeper Jerry Dawson, who played 569 games between 1907 and 1929. The club&#x27;s top goal scorer is George Beel, who scored 188 goals from 1923 to 1932. In 1962, Jimmy Adamson won the FWA Footballer of the Year award, the first and to date only time a Burnley player achieved this. Willie Irvine became top goal scorer in the first tier in 1965–66 with 29 goals, a unique feat in the club&#x27;s history. Jimmy McIlroy is the most capped player while at the club, as he made 51 appearances for Northern Ireland between 1951 and 1962. The first Burnley player to play in a full international match was John Yates, who took to the field for England against Ireland in March 1889. He scored a hat-trick but was never called up again. In January 1957, 17-year-old Ian Lawson netted a record four goals on his debut against Chesterfield in the FA Cup third round. The youngest player to play for the club is Tommy Lawton, who was aged 16 years and 174 days on his debut against Doncaster Rovers in the Second Division on 28 March 1936. His debut made him the then youngest centre-forward ever to play in the Football League. The oldest player is Len Smelt, who played his last match aged 41 years and 132 days against Arsenal in the First Division on 18 April 1925.

The club&#x27;s largest win in league football was a 9–0 victory against Darwen in the 1891–92 Football League. Burnley&#x27;s largest victories in the FA Cup have been 9–0 wins over Crystal Palace (1908–09), New Brighton (1956–57) and Penrith (1984–85). The largest defeat is an 11–0 loss to Darwen Old Wanderers in the 1885–86 FA Cup first round, when Burnley fielded their reserve side, as most professionals were still prohibited entry due to rules of the FA that season. The team&#x27;s longest unbeaten run in the league was between 6 September 1920 and 25 March 1921, to which they remained unbeaten for 30 games on their way to the First Division title. It stood as the longest stretch without defeat in a single English professional league season until Arsenal bettered it in 2003–04.

The club&#x27;s highest home attendance is 54,775, for an FA Cup third round match against Huddersfield Town on 23 February 1924; Burnley&#x27;s record home attendance in the league is 52,869, for a First Division game against Blackpool on 11 October 1947. The highest transfer fee received is the £31.5 million from Tottenham Hotspur for Wilson Odobert in 2024. The highest transfer fee paid by Burnley is the £16.1 million paid to Basel for striker Zeki Amdouni in 2023. Bob Kelly broke the world transfer record in 1925, when he moved for a fee of £6,500 (equivalent to £ in 2025) from Burnley to Sunderland.

<text>Clarkson Frederick Stanfield (3 December 179318 May 1867) was an English painter best known for his large-scale paintings of marine art and landscapes. He was the father of the painter George Clarkson Stanfield and the composer Francis Stanfield.

==Early life==

Stanfield was born in Sunderland, the son of James Field Stanfield (1749–1824) an Irish-born author, actor and former seaman, and Mary Hoad, an artist and actress. Stanfield was likely to have inherited artistic talent from his mother, who is said to have been an accomplished artist, but died in 1801. His father remarried, to Maria Kell, a year later. Stanfield was named after Thomas Clarkson, the slave trade abolitionist, whom his father knew, and this was the only forename he used, although there is reason to believe Frederick was a second one.

He was briefly apprenticed to a coach decorator in 1806, but left owing to the drunkenness of his master&#x27;s wife and joined a South Shields collier to become a sailor. In 1808 he was pressed into the Royal Navy, serving in the guardship HMS &quot;Namur&quot; at Sheerness. Discharged on health grounds in 1814, he then made a voyage to China in 1815 on the East Indiaman &quot;Warley&quot; and returned with many sketches.

==Scenery==
An accident forced Stanfield to leave active service, but during his voyages he had acquired considerable skill as a draughtsman. In August 1816 Stanfield was engaged as a decorator and scene-painter at the Royalty Theatre in Wellclose Square, London. Along with David Roberts he was afterwards employed at the Coburg Theatre in Lambeth, and in 1823 he became a resident scene-painter at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, where he rose rapidly to fame through the huge quantity of spectacular scenery and (moving) dioramas which he produced for that house until 1834.

Stanfield abandoned scenery painting after Christmas 1834, though he made exceptions for two personal friends: he designed scenery for the stage productions of William Charles Macready, and for the amateur theatricals of Charles Dickens.

==Spectacles==

Stanfield partnered with David Roberts in several large-scale diorama and panorama projects in the 1820s and 1830s. The newest development in these popular entertainments was the &quot;moving diorama&quot; or &quot;moving panorama.&quot; These consisted of huge paintings that unfolded upon rollers like giant scrolls; they were supplemented with sound and lighting effects to create a nineteenth-century anticipation of cinema. Stanfield and Roberts produced eight of these entertainments; in light of their later accomplishments as marine painters, their panoramas of two important naval engagements, &quot;the Bombardment of Algiers&quot; and &quot;The Battle of Navarino,&quot; are worth noting.

An 1830 tour through Germany and Italy furnished Stanfield with material for two more moving panoramas, &quot;The Military Pass of the Simplon&quot; (1830) and &quot;Venice and Its Adjacent Islands&quot; (1831). Stanfield executed the first in only eleven days; it earned him a fee of £300. The Venetian panorama of the next year was 300 feet long and 20 high; gas lit, it unrolled through 15 or 20 minutes. The show included stage props and even singing gondoliers. After the show closed, portions of the work were re-used in productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and Otway&#x27;s &quot;Venice Preserved&quot;.
The moving panoramas of Stanfield and other artists became highlights of the traditional Christmas pantomimes.

==Mature career==
Meanwhile, Stanfield developed his skills as an easel painter, especially of marine subjects; he first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1820 and continued, with only a few early interruptions, to his death. He was also a founder member of the Society of British Artists (from 1824) and its president for 1829, and exhibited there and at the British Institution, where in 1828 his picture &quot;Wreckers off Fort Rouge&quot; gained a premium of 50 guineas.

He was elected Associate Member of the Royal Academy in 1832, and became a full Academician in February 1835. His elevation was in part a result of the interest of William IV who, having admired his &quot;St. Michael&#x27;s Mount&quot; at the Academy in 1831 (now in the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia), commissioned two works from him of &quot;The Opening of New London Bridge&quot; (1832) and &quot;Portsmouth Harbour&quot;. Both remain in the Royal Collection.

Until his death he contributed a long series of powerful and highly popular works to the Academy, both of marine subjects and landscapes from his travels at home and in France, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Ireland. Notable works include:
*&quot;The Battle of Trafalgar&quot; (1836), executed for the United Service Club
*the &quot;Castle of Ischia&quot; (1841), now in Sunderland Museum and Art Gallery
*&quot;Isola Bella&quot; (1841), among the results of a visit to Italy in 1839
*&quot;French troops Fording the Magra&quot; (1847)
*&quot;HMS The Victory Bearing the Body of Nelson Towed into Gibraltar after the Battle of Trafalgar&quot; (1853), painted for Sir Samuel Morton Peto at Somerleyton Hall, Suffolk (which is today open to the public)
*&quot;The Abandoned&quot; (1856; untraced since 1930)
He also executed two notable series of Venetian subjects, one for the former dining room at Bowood House, Wiltshire, for the 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne, the other for the Duchess of Sutherland at Trentham Park, Staffordshire. Neither house survives but some of Stanfield&#x27;s work for Bowood can still be seen there (the present Bowood House and park, open to the public, is a conversion of the old stable block).

He illustrated Heath&#x27;s &quot;Picturesque Annuals&quot; for the years 1832–1834, and in 1838 published a collection of lithographic views on the Rhine, Moselle and Meuse; forty subjects from both sides of the English Channel were also steel-engraved under the title of &quot;Stanfield&#x27;s Coast Scenery&quot; (1836). Among literary works for which he provided illustrations were Captain Marryat&#x27;s &quot;The Pirate and the Three Cutters&quot; (1836), &quot;Poor Jack&quot; (1840) and the lives and works of Lord Byron, George Crabbe, and Samuel Johnson, mainly in editions by John Murray.

== Assessment ==

Stanfield&#x27;s art was powerfully influenced by his early practice as a scene-painter. But, though there is always a touch of the spectacular and the scenic in his works, and though their colour is apt to be rather dry and hard, they are large and effective in handling, powerful in their treatment of broad atmospheric effects and telling in composition, and they evince the most complete knowledge of the artistic materials with which their painter deals.

The art critic John Ruskin considered his treatment of the sea and clouds of a very high order and called him the &quot;leader of our English Realists.&quot; Wishing him to be sometimes &quot;less wonderful and more terrible,&quot; Ruskin also pointed out the superior merits of his sketched work, especially in watercolour, to the often contrived picturesque qualities of many of his exhibited oils and the watercolours on which published engravings were based.

== Death and legacy ==
In his last 10 years, Stanfield&#x27;s health deteriorated. He died in Hampstead, London, on 18 May 1867; there was an unfinished painting on his easel and a previous work, &quot;A Skirmish off Heligoland,&quot; hanging in a Royal Academy exhibition. He was buried in Kensal Green Catholic Cemetery.

Lifelong friend of Stanfield, the writer Charles Dickens, was one of the last visitors that Stanfield saw on the day he died. After Stanfield&#x27;s death, Dickens wrote: &quot;He was the soul of frankness, generosity and simplicity. The most genial, the most affectionate, the most loving and the most lovable of men. Success had never for an instant spoiled him . . . He had been a sailor once; and all the best characteristics that are popularly attributed to sailors, being his, and being in him refined by the influence of his Art, formed a whole not likely to be often seen.&quot;

In 1870, three years after his death, Stanfield was awarded a major retrospective of his work at the inaugural Royal Academy Winter Exhibition. In its appraisal of the show, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote: &quot;There are no English painters whose works have won wider and warmer popularity outside the artistic pale. Stanfield&#x27;s practiced command of the artist of composition, his unerring sense of the agreeable and picturesque in subject and effect, his pleasant and cheerful color and last, not least, the large use to which he turned his knowledge and love of the sea and shipping… (all) added to the widespread admiration he had won by his consummately skillful scene painting, (and) combined to make him one of the most popular, if not the most popular, of landscape painters.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Stanfield was admired not only for his art but his personal simplicity and a modesty. He was born a Catholic and became increasingly devout in middle life, after the loss in 1838 of his eldest son by his second marriage (to Rebecca Adcock) and then, in the 1850s, both the children of his first marriage (to Mary Hutchinson, who had died in childbirth).

His eldest surviving son, George Clarkson Stanfield (1828–1878) was also a painter of similar subjects, largely trained by his father. Another son, Francis Stanfield (1835–1914) was an English Catholic priest who is noted for having composed several notable hymns. His daughter Harriet married W. H. G. Bagshawe, son of Henry Bagshawe, and was mother of Joseph Ridgard Bagshawe, also a marine painter.

<doc id="376728" wikidata="Q170895" url="?curid=376728" title="Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic or Moldavian SSR (, ), also known as the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic, Moldovan SSR, Soviet Moldavia, Soviet Moldova, or simply Moldavia or Moldova, was one of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union which existed from 1940 to 1991. The republic was formed on 2 August 1940 from parts of Bessarabia, a region annexed from Romania on 28 June of that year, and parts of the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, an autonomous Soviet republic within the Ukrainian SSR.

After the Declaration of Sovereignty on 23 June 1990, and until 23 May 1991, it was officially known as the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldova. From 23 May 1991 until the declaration of independence on 27 August 1991, it was renamed the Republic of Moldova while remaining a constituent republic of the USSR. Its independence was recognized on 26 December of that year when the USSR was dissolved.

Geographically, the Moldavian SSR was bordered by the Socialist Republic of Romania to the west and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to the north, east, and south.

== History ==

=== Background ===
After the failure of the Tatarbunary Uprising, the Soviets promoted the newly created Moldavian Autonomous Oblast existing within the Ukrainian SSR on part of the territory between the Dniester and Bug rivers, to a Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Moldavian ASSR), on 12 October 1924, as a way to primarily prop up the Soviet propaganda effort in Bessarabia, but also to exert pressure on Bucharest in the negotiations on Bessarabia, and even to help a possible Communist revolution in Romania.

On 24 August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression treaty, called the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet spheres of influence. The secret protocol placed the province of Bessarabia, at the time controlled by Romania, in the Soviet &quot;sphere of influence.&quot; Thereafter, both the Soviet Union and Germany invaded their respective portions of Poland, while the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in June 1940, and waged war upon Finland.

=== Establishment ===
On 26 June 1940, four days after the end of the battle of France, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Romania, demanding the latter cede Bessarabia and Bukovina. After the Soviets agreed with Germany that they would limit their claims in Bukovina, which was outside the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact&#x27;s secret protocols, to Northern Bukovina, Germany urged Romania to accept the ultimatum, which Romania did two days later. On 28 June, Soviet troops entered the area, and on 9 July the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic was formed and applied to the Supreme Soviet for formal incorporation into the Soviet Union.

On 2 August 1940, the Supreme Soviet unanimously approved to dissolve the old Moldavian ASSR and organize the Moldavian SSR. The new SSR included six full counties and small parts of three other Moldavian counties of Bessarabia (about 65 percent of its territory), and the six westernmost raions of the Moldavian ASSR (about 40 percent of its territory). Ninety percent of the territory of the MSSR was west of the river Dniester, which had been the border between the USSR and Romania prior to 1940, and ten percent east. Northern and southern parts of the territories occupied by the Soviet Union in June 1940 (the current Chernivtsi Oblast and Budjak), which were more heterogeneous ethnically, were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR, although their population also included 337,000 Moldavians. As such, the strategically important Black Sea coast and Danube frontage were given to the Ukrainian SSR, considered more reliable than the Moldavian SSR, which could have been claimed by Romania. In the summer of 1941, Romania joined Hitler&#x27;s Axis in the invasion of the Soviet Union, recovering Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, and also occupying the territory to the east of the Dniester, dubbed &quot;Transnistria&quot;. Pro-Soviet partisans remained active in both regions. By the end of World War II, the Soviet Union had reconquered all of the lost territories, reestablishing Soviet authority there.

On 22 June 1941, during the first day of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, 10 people were killed in Răzeni by Soviet authorities and buried in a mass graves. In July 1941 after Operation Barbarossa, a commemorative plaque was installed in Răzeni. The memorial to victims of Răzeni Massacre was opened in 2009.

The Soviet authorities targeted several socio-economic groups due to their economic situation, political views, or ties to the former regime. They were deported to or resettled in Siberia and the Kazakh SSR; some were imprisoned or executed. According to a report by the Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania, no less than 86,604 people were arrested and deported in 1940 and 1941 alone, comparable to the estimative number of 90,000 repressed put forward by Russian historians.

Immediately after the Soviet reoccupation, in 1944, a so-called &quot;repatriation&quot; of the Bessarabians who fled to Romania before the advancing Red Army was organized by the Soviet security forces; many were shot or deported, blamed as collaborators of Romania and Nazi Germany.

NKVD/MGB also struck at anti-Soviet groups, which were most active from 1944 to 1952. Anti-Soviet organizations such as Democratic Agrarian Party, Freedom Party, Democratic Union of Freedom, Arcașii lui Ștefan, Vasile Lupu High School Group, Vocea Basarabiei were severely reprimanded and their leaders were persecuted.

A de-kulakisation campaign was directed towards the rich Moldavian peasant families, which were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia as well. For instance, in just two days, from 6 to 7 July 1949, over 11,342 Moldavian families were deported by the order of the Minister of State Security, Iosif Mordovets under a plan named &quot;Operation South&quot;.

Religious persecutions during the Soviet occupation targeted numerous priests. After the Soviet occupation, the religious life underwent a persecution similar to the one in Russia between the two World Wars. Religious minorities, 700 families, especially Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, were deported to Siberia in Operation North of April 1951.

The number of the ethnic Bessarabia Germans also decreased from over 81,000 in 1930 to under 4,000 in 1959 due to voluntary wartime migration (90,000 were transferred in 1940 to German-occupied Poland) and forced removal as collaborators after the war.

==== Collectivisation ====
Collectivisation was implemented between 1949 and 1950, although earlier attempts were made since 1946. During this time, a large-scale famine occurred: some sources give a minimum of 115,000 peasants who died of famine and related diseases between December 1946 and August 1947. According to Charles King, there is no evidence that it was provoked by Soviet requisitioning of large amounts of agricultural products and directed towards the largest ethnic group living in the countryside, the Moldavians. Contributing factors were the recent war and the drought of 1946.

=== Khrushchev and Brezhnev ===

With the regime of Nikita Khrushchev replacing that of Joseph Stalin, the survivors of Gulag camps and of the deportees were gradually allowed to return to the Moldavian SSR. The political thaw ended the unchecked power of the NKVD–MGB, and the command economy gave rise to development in the areas such as education, technology and science, health care, and industry.

Between 1969 and 1971, a clandestine National Patriotic Front was established by several young intellectuals in Chișinău by Mihail Munteanu, vowing to fight for the secession of Moldavia from the Soviet Union and union with Romania.

In December 1971, following an informative note from Ion Stănescu, the President of the Council of State Security of the Romanian Socialist Republic, to Yuri Andropov, the chief of KGB, three of the leaders of the National Patriotic Front, Alexandru Usatiuc-Bulgăr, Gheorghe Ghimpu and Valeriu Graur, as well as a fourth person, Alexandru Șoltoianu, the leader of a similar clandestine movement in Northern Bukovina, were arrested and later sentenced to long prison terms.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Moldavia received substantial investment from the budget of the USSR to develop industrial, scientific facilities, as well as housing. In 1971, the Soviet Council of Ministers adopted a decision &quot;About the measures for further development of Kishinev city&quot; that secured more than one billion roubles of investment from the USSR budget.

Subsequent decisions directed enormous wealth and brought highly qualified specialists from all over the USSR to develop the Soviet republic. Such an allocation of USSR assets was partially influenced by the fact that Leonid Brezhnev, the effective ruler of the USSR from 1964 to 1982, was the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Moldavia from 1950 to 1952. These allocations stopped in 1991 with the Belavezha Accords, when the nation became independent.

=== Perestroika ===

Although Brezhnev and other CPM first secretaries were largely successful in suppressing Moldavian nationalism, Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s administration facilitated the revival of the movement in the region. His policies of glasnost and perestroika created conditions in which national feelings could be openly expressed and in which the Soviet republics could consider reforms independently from the central government.

The Moldavian SSR&#x27;s drive towards independence from the USSR was marked by civil strife as conservative activists in the east —especially in Tiraspol—as well as communist party activists in Chișinău worked to keep the Moldavian SSR within the Soviet Union. The main success of the national movement from 1988 to 1989 was the official adoption of the Moldovan language on 31 August 1989, by the Supreme Soviet of Moldova, the declaration in the preamble of the declaration of independence of a Moldavian–Romanian linguistic unity, and the return of the language to the pre-Soviet Latin alphabet. In 1990, when it became clear that Moldavia was eventually going to secede, a group of nationalist pro-Soviet activists in Gagauzia and Transnistria proclaimed themselves as separate from the Moldavian SSR in order to remain within the USSR. The Gagauz Republic was eventually peacefully incorporated into Moldavia as the Autonomous Territorial Unit of Gagauzia, but relations with Transnistria soured. Its sovereignty was declared on 23 June 1990 on its territory.

=== Independence ===

On 17 March 1991, Moldova, the Baltic states, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, and the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic boycotted the 1991 Soviet Union referendum with 98.72% in favor without any official sanction. On 23 May 1991, the Moldavian parliament changed the name of the republic to the Republic of Moldova. The Gagauz declared the Gagauz Republic on 19 August 1990. They had previously declared a Gagauz ASSR within Moldova on 12 November 1989.

Independence was quickly followed by civil war in Transnistria, where the central government in Chișinău battled with separatists, who were supported by pro-Soviet forces and later by different forces from Russia. The conflict left the breakaway regime (Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic) in control of Transnistria – a situation that persists today. The Soviet Union ceased to exist on 26 December 1991, and Moldova was officially recognized as an independent state.

== Relationship with Romania ==
In the 1947 Paris Peace Treaty, the Soviet Union and Romania reaffirmed each other&#x27;s borders, recognizing Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Herza region as territory of the respective Soviet republics. Throughout the Cold War, the issue of Bessarabia remained largely dormant in Romania. In the 1950s, research on history and of Bessarabia was a banned subject in Romania, as the Romanian Communist Party tried to emphasise the links between the Romanians and Russians, the annexation being considered just a proof of Soviet Union&#x27;s internationalism. Starting in the 1960s, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Nicolae Ceaușescu began a policy of distancing from the Soviet Union, but the debate over Bessarabia was discussed only in scholarship fields such as historiography and linguistics, not at a political level.

As Soviet–Romanian relations reached an all-time low in the mid-1960s, Soviet scholars published historical papers on the &quot;Struggle of Unification of Bessarabia with the Soviet Motherland&quot; (Artiom Lazarev) and the &quot;Development of the Moldovan Language&quot; (Nicolae Corlăteanu). On the other side, the Romanian Academy published some notes by Karl Marx which talk about the &quot;injustice&quot; of the 1812 annexation of Bessarabia and Nicolae Ceaușescu in a 1965 speech quoted a letter by Friedrich Engels in which he criticized the Russian annexation, while in another 1966 speech, he denounced the pre-World War II calls of the Romanian Communist Party for the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and Bukovina.

The issue was brought to light whenever the relationships with the Soviets were waning, but never became a serious subject of high-level negotiations in itself. On 22 June 1976, Ștefan Andrei, a member on the Permanent Bureau of the Political Executive Committee of Romania and a future Minister of Foreign Affairs, underscored that the republic harbored no territorial claims and recognized &quot;the Moldavian Socialist Republic as an integral part of the USSR,&quot; yet that it &quot;cannot accept the idea that Moldavians are not Romanians.&quot;

On 1 August 1976, Nicolae Ceaușescu, Elena Ceaușescu, Nicu Ceaușescu, Ștefan Andrei, and Ambassador Gheorghe Badrus were the first high-level Romanian visitors to Moldova since World War II. On 1 August, they came from Iași, and the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Moldavia Ivan Bodiul, Kiril Iliashenko, and N. Merenișcev escorted them from the border until they left for Crimea at the Chișinău International Airport on 2 August. The move was widely interpreted as a sign of improved relations. During a meeting, Brezhnev insisted that Ceaușescu himself had the opportunity to see that the Moldavians existed as a separate people with a separate language during his 1976 visit. &quot;Yes,&quot; Ceaușescu replied, &quot;I did, but they spoke with me in Romanian.&quot;

In December 1976, Bodiul and his wife Claudia arrived for a return visit of five days at Ceaușescu&#x27;s invitation. Bodiul&#x27;s visit was a &quot;first&quot; in the history of postwar bilateral relations. At one of his meetings in Bucharest, Bodiul said that &quot;the good relationship was initiated by Ceaușescu&#x27;s visit to Soviet Moldavia, which led to the expansion of contacts and exchanges in all fields. A visit was paid from 14 to 16 June 1979, to the Moldavian SSR by a Romanian Communist Party delegation headed by Ion Iliescu, Political Executive Committee alternate member and Iași County Party Committee First Secretary.

As late as November 1989, as Russian support decreased, Ceaușescu brought up the Bessarabian question once again and denounced the Soviet invasion during the 14th Congress of the Romanian Communist Party.

After the fall of communism in Romania, on 5 April 1991, its president Ion Iliescu, and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev signed a political treaty which among other things recognized the Soviet-Romanian border. However, the Parliament of Romania refused to ratify it. Romania and Russia eventually signed and ratified a treaty in 2003, after the independence of Moldova and Ukraine.

== Leadership ==
The Communist Party of Moldavia was a component of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party was the sole legal political organization until perestroika. It had supreme power in the land, as all state and public organizations were its subordinates.

Until the 1978 Constitution of the Moldavian SSR (15 April 1978), the republic had four cities directly subordinated to the republican government: Chișinău, Bălți, Bender, and Tiraspol. By the new constitution, the following cities were added to this category: Orhei, Rîbnița, Soroca, and Ungheni. The former four cities, and 40 raions were the first-tier administrative units of the land.

== Economy ==
Although it was the most densely populated republic of the USSR, the Moldavian SSR was meant to be a rural country specialized in agriculture. Kyrgyzstan was the only Soviet Republic to hold a larger percentage of rural population.
While holding just 0.2% of the Soviet territory, it accounted for 10% of the canned food production, 4.2% of its vegetables, 12.3% of its fruits and 8.2% of its wine production.

At the same time, most of the Moldavian industry was built in Transnistria. While accounting for roughly 15% of the population of Moldavian SSR, Transnistria was responsible for 40% of its GDP and for 90% of electricity production.

Major factories included the Rîbnița steel mill, Dubăsari and Moldavskaia power station and the factories near Tiraspol, producing refrigerators, clothing and alcohol.

== Society ==

=== Education and language ===

Beginning with the early 1950s, the government gradually abandoned the language standard based on the central Bessarabian speech, established as official during the Moldavian ASSR, in favour of the Romanian standard. Hence, Mihai Eminescu and Vasile Alecsandri were again allowed, and the standard written language became the same as Romanian, except that it was written with Cyrillic script.

Access to Romanian authors born outside the medieval Principality of Moldavia was restricted, as was the case with works by authors such as Eminescu, Mihail Kogălniceanu, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Constantin Stere that promoted a Romanian national sentiment. Contacts with Romania were not severed and, after 1956, people were slowly allowed to visit or receive relatives in Romania. Romanian press became accessible, and cross-border Romanian TV and radio programmes could be easily received. Nevertheless, the Soviet–Romanian border along the Prut river, separating Bessarabia from Romania, was closed for the general public.

=== Culture ===
The little nationalism which existed in the Moldavian elite manifested itself in poems and articles in literary journals, before their authors were purged in campaigns against &quot;anti-Soviet feelings&quot; and &quot;local nationalism&quot; organized by Bodiul and Grossu.

The official stance of the Soviet government was that Moldavian culture was distinct from Romanian culture, but they had a more coherent policy than the previous one from the Moldavian ASSR. There were no more attempts in creating a Moldovan language that is different from Romanian, the literary Romanian written with the Cyrillic alphabet being accepted as the linguistic standard for Moldavia. The only difference was in some technical terms borrowed from Russian.

Moldavians were encouraged to adopt the Russian language, which was required for any leadership job (Russian was intended to be the Lingua Franca of interethnic communication in the Soviet Union). In the early years, political and academic positions were given to members of non-Moldavian ethnic groups (only 14% of the Moldavian SSR&#x27;s political leaders were ethnic Moldavians in 1946), although this gradually changed as time went on.

=== Demographics ===
In the aftermath of World War II, many Russians and Ukrainians, along with a smaller number of other ethnic groups, migrated from the rest of the USSR to Moldavia in order to help rebuild the heavily war-damaged economy. They were mostly factory and construction workers who settled in major urban areas, as well as military personnel stationed in the region. From a socio-economic point of view, this group was quite diverse: in addition to industrial and construction workers, as well as retired officers and soldiers of the Soviet army, it also included engineers, technicians, a handful of scientists, but mostly unqualified workers.

Access of native Bessarabians to positions in administration and economy was limited, as they were considered untrustworthy. The first local to become minister in the Moldavian SSR was only in the 1960s as minister of health. The antagonism between &quot;natives&quot;, and &quot;newcomers&quot; persisted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union and was clear during the anti-Soviet and anti-Communist events from 1988 to 1992. The immigration affected mostly the cities of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, as well as the countryside of Budjak where the Bessarabia Germans previously were, but also the cities of Transnistria. All of these saw the proportion of ethnic Moldavians slowly drop throughout the Soviet rule.

==Legacy==
The widespread nostalgia for the Soviet Union influences electoral choice in the Republic of Moldova. According to a 2017 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, nostalgia for the USSR is common with 70% of Moldovans stating that the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 was a bad thing for their country. In the region of Gagauzia, the main street of Etulia is named after Vladimir Lenin and a statue of Karl Marx is still preserved in front of the village hall.

<text>The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, abbreviated as the Ukrainian SSR, UkSSR, and also known as Soviet Ukraine or just Ukraine, was one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union from 1922 until 1991. Under the Soviet one-party model, the Ukrainian SSR was governed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union through its republican branch, the Communist Party of Ukraine.

The first iterations of the Ukrainian SSR were established during the Russian Revolution, particularly after the Bolshevik Revolution. The outbreak of the Ukrainian–Soviet War in the former Russian Empire saw the Bolsheviks defeat the independent Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, during the conflict against which they founded the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic of Soviets, which was governed by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), in December 1917; it was later succeeded by the Ukrainian Soviet Republic in 1918. Simultaneously with the Russian Civil War, the Ukrainian War of Independence was being fought among the different Ukrainian republics founded by Ukrainian nationalists, Ukrainian anarchists, and Ukrainian separatists – primarily against Soviet Russia and the Ukrainian SSR, with either help or opposition from neighbouring states. In 1922, it was one of four Soviet republics (with the Russian SFSR, the Byelorussian SSR, and the Transcaucasian SFSR) that signed the Treaty on the Creation of the Soviet Union. As a Soviet quasi-state, the Ukrainian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945 alongside the Byelorussian SSR, in spite of the fact that they were also legally represented by the Soviet Union in foreign affairs. Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Ukrainian SSR emerged as the present-day independent state of Ukraine, although the modified Soviet-era constitution remained in use until the adoption of the modern Ukrainian constitution in June 1996.

The republic&#x27;s borders changed many times, with a general trend toward acquiring lands with ethnic Ukrainian population majority, and losing lands with other ethnic majorities. A significant portion of what is now western Ukraine was gained via the Soviet-German Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, with the annexation of Eastern Galicia and Volhynia in 1939, significant portions of Romania in 1940, and Carpathian Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia in 1945. From the 1919 establishment of the Ukrainian SSR until 1934, the city of Kharkov served as its capital; however, the republic&#x27;s seat of government was subsequently relocated in 1934 to the city of Kiev, the historic Ukrainian capital, and remained at Kiev for the remainder of its existence.

Geographically, the Ukrainian SSR was situated in Eastern Europe, to the north of the Black Sea, and was bordered by the Soviet republics of Moldavia (since 1940), Byelorussia, and Russia, and the countries of Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The republic&#x27;s border with Czechoslovakia formed the Soviet Union&#x27;s westernmost border point. According to the 1989 Soviet census, the republic of Ukraine had a population of 51,706,746 (second after Russia).

==Name==

Its original names in 1919 were both Ukraine and Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic (, abbreviated ). After the ratification of the 1936 Soviet Constitution, full official names of all Soviet republics were changed, transposing the second (&quot;socialist&quot;) and third (&quot;sovietskaya&quot; in Russian or &quot;radianska&quot; in Ukrainian) words. In accordance, on 5 December 1936, the 8th Extraordinary Congress Soviets in Soviet Union changed the name of the republic to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was ratified by the 14th Extraordinary Congress of Soviets in Ukrainian SSR on 31 January 1937.

The name &quot;Ukraine&quot; () is a subject of debate. It is often perceived as being derived from the Slavic word &quot;okraina&quot;, meaning &quot;border land&quot;. It was first used to define part of the territory of Kievan Rus&#x27; (Ruthenia) in the 12th century, at which point Kiev (now Kyiv) was the capital of Rus&#x27;. The name has been used in a variety of ways since the twelfth century. For example, Zaporozhian Cossacks called their hetmanate &quot;Ukraine&quot;.

Within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the name carried unofficial status for larger part of Kiev Voivodeship.

&quot;&quot;The&quot; Ukraine&quot; was once the usual form in English, despite Ukrainian not having a definite article. Since the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine, this form has become less common in the English-speaking world, and style-guides warn against its use in professional writing. According to U.S. ambassador William Taylor, &quot;The Ukraine&quot; implies disregard for the country&#x27;s sovereignty. The Ukrainian position is that the usage of &quot;The Ukraine&quot; is incorrect both grammatically and politically.&quot;

==History==
After the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II during the February Revolution of 1917 in Petrograd, many people in Ukraine wished to establish an autonomous Ukrainian Republic. During a period of the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1923, many factions claiming themselves governments of the newly born republic were formed, each with supporters and opponents. The two most prominent of them were an independent government in Kiev called the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UNR) and a Soviet Russia-aligned government in Kharkov called the Ukrainian Soviet Republic (USR). The Kiev-based UNR was internationally recognized and supported by the Central Powers following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, whereas the Kharkov-based USR was solely supported by the Soviet Russian forces, while neither the UNR nor the USR were explicitly supported by the White Russian forces that remained, although there were attempts to establish cooperation during the closing stages of the war with the former.

The conflict between the two competing governments, known as the Ukrainian–Soviet War, was part of the ongoing Russian Civil War, as well as a struggle for national independence (known as the Ukrainian War of Independence), which ended with the territory of pro-independence Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic being annexed into a new Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic, western Ukraine being annexed into the Second Polish Republic, and the newly stable Ukrainian SSR becoming a founding member of the Soviet Union.

The government of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic was founded on 24–25 December 1917. In its publications, it named itself either the Republic of Soviets of Workers&#x27;, Soldiers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Deputies or the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic of Soviets. The 1917 republic was only recognised by another non-recognised country, the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. With the signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty by Russia, it was ultimately defeated by mid-1918 and eventually dissolved.

In July 1918, the former members of the government formed the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine, the constituent assembly of which took place in Moscow. With the defeat of the Central Powers in World War I, the Bolsheviks resumed its hostilities towards the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic fighting for Ukrainian independence and organised another Soviet Ukrainian government. 

The Provisional Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Government of Ukraine was created on November 28, 1918, in Kursk, with the provisional government assigned to the city of Sudzha. On 10 March 1919, the Third All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets ratified the constitution of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in Kharkiv.

===Founding: 1917–1922===
After the Russian Revolution of 1917, several factions sought to create an independent Ukrainian state, alternately cooperating and struggling against each other. Numerous more or less socialist-oriented factions participated in the formation of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic among which were Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, Socialists-Revolutionaries and many others. The most popular faction was initially the local Socialist Revolutionary Party that composed the local government together with Federalists and Mensheviks.

Immediately after the October Revolution in Petrograd, Bolsheviks instigated the Kiev Bolshevik Uprising to support the revolution and secure Kiev. Due to a lack of adequate support from the local population and governing anti-communist Central Rada, however, the Kiev Bolshevik group split. Most moved to Kharkov and received the support of the eastern Ukrainian cities and industrial centers. Later, this move was regarded as a mistake by some of the People&#x27;s Commissars (Yevgenia Bosch). They issued an ultimatum to the Central Rada on 17 December to recognise the Soviet government of which the Rada was very critical. The Bolsheviks convened a separate congress and declared the first Soviet Republic of Ukraine on 24 December 1917 claiming the Central Rada and its supporters outlaws that need to be eradicated. Warfare ensued against the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic for the installation of the Soviet regime in the country, and with the direct support from Soviet Russia the Ukrainian National forces were practically overrun. The government of Ukraine appealed to foreign capitals, finding support in the face of the Central Powers as the others refused to recognise it. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Russian SFSR yielded all the captured Ukrainian territory as the Bolsheviks were forced out of Ukraine. The government of Soviet Ukraine was dissolved after its last session on 20 November 1918.

After re-taking Kharkov in February 1919, a second Soviet Ukrainian government was formed. The government enforced Russian policies that did not adhere to local needs. A group of three thousand workers were dispatched from Russia to take grain from local farms to feed Russian cities and were met with resistance. The Ukrainian language was also censured from administrative and educational use. Eventually fighting both White forces in the east and Ukrainian forces in the west, Lenin ordered the liquidation of the second Soviet Ukrainian government in August 1919.

Eventually, after the creation of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine in Moscow, a third Ukrainian Soviet government was formed on 21 December 1919 that initiated new hostilities against Ukrainian nationalists as they lost their military support from the defeated Central Powers. Eventually, the Red Army ended up controlling much of the Ukrainian territory after the Polish-Soviet Peace of Riga. On 30 December 1922, along with the Russian, Byelorussian and Transcaucasian republics, the Ukrainian SSR became one of the founding members of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).
=== Interwar years: 1922–1939===
During the 1920s, a policy of Ukrainization was pursued in the Ukrainian SSR, as part of the general Soviet korenization policy; this involved promoting the use and the social status of the Ukrainian language and the elevation of ethnic Ukrainians to leadership positions (see &quot;Ukrainization – early years of Soviet Ukraine&quot; for more details).

In 1932, the aggressive agricultural policies of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s regime resulted in one of the largest national catastrophes in the modern history for the Ukrainian nation. A famine known as the Holodomor caused a direct loss of human life estimated between 2.6 million to 10 million. Some scholars and the World Congress of Free Ukrainians assert that this was an act of genocide. The International Commission of Inquiry Into the 1932–1933 Famine in Ukraine found no evidence that the famine was part of a preconceived plan to starve Ukrainians, and concluded in 1990 that the famine was caused by a combination of factors, including Soviet policies of compulsory grain requisitions, forced collectivization, dekulakization, and Russification. The General Assembly of the UN has stopped shy of recognizing the Holodomor as genocide, calling it a &quot;great tragedy&quot; as a compromise between tense positions of United Kingdom, United States, Russia, and Ukraine on the matter, while some nations went on to individually categorize it as genocide, including France, Germany, and the United States after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== World War II: 1939–1945 ===


In September 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Poland and occupied Galician lands inhabited by Ukrainians, Poles and Jews adding it to the territory of the Ukrainian SSR. In 1940, the Soviet Union occupied Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region, lands inhabited by Romanians, Ukrainians, Russians, Jews, Bulgarians and Gagauz, adding them to the territory of the Ukrainian SSR and the newly formed Moldavian SSR. In 1945, these lands were permanently annexed, and the Transcarpathia region was added as well, by treaty with the post-war administration of Czechoslovakia. Following eastward Soviet retreat in 1941, Ufa became the wartime seat of the Soviet Ukrainian government.

=== Post-war years: 1945–1953 ===
While World War II (called the Great Patriotic War by the Soviet government) did not end before May 1945, the Germans were driven out of Ukraine between February 1943 and October 1944. The first task of the Soviet authorities was to reestablish political control over the republic which had been entirely lost during the war. This was an immense task, considering the widespread human and material losses. During World War II the Soviet Union lost about 8.6 million combatants and around 18 million civilians, of these, 6.8 million were Ukrainian civilians and military personnel. Also, an estimated 3.9 million Ukrainians were evacuated to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic during the war, and 2.2 million Ukrainians were sent to forced labour camps by the Germans.

The material devastation was huge; Adolf Hitler&#x27;s orders to create &quot;a zone of annihilation&quot; in 1943, coupled with the Soviet military&#x27;s scorched-earth policy in 1941, meant Ukraine lay in ruins. These two policies led to the destruction of more than 28,000 villages and 714 cities and towns. 85 percent of Kiev&#x27;s city centre was destroyed, as was 70 percent of the city centre of the second-largest city in Ukraine, Kharkov. Because of this, 19 million people were left homeless after the war. The republic&#x27;s industrial base, as so much else, was destroyed. The Soviet government had managed to evacuate 544 industrial enterprises between July and November 1941, but the rapid German advance led to the destruction or the partial destruction of 16,150 enterprises. 27,910 collective farms, 1,300 machine tractor stations and 872 state farms were destroyed by the Germans.
While the war brought to Ukraine an enormous physical destruction, victory also led to territorial expansion. As a victor, the Soviet Union gained new prestige and more land. The Ukrainian border was expanded to the Curzon Line. Ukraine was also expanded southwards, near the area Izmail, previously part of Romania. An agreement was signed by the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia whereby Carpathian Ruthenia was handed over to Ukraine. The territory of Ukraine expanded by and increased its population by an estimated 11 million.

After World War II, amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR were accepted, which allowed it to act as a separate subject of international law in some cases and to a certain extent, remaining a part of the Soviet Union at the same time. In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of the founding members of the United Nations (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR. This was part of a deal with the United States to ensure a degree of balance in the General Assembly, which, the USSR opined, was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc. In its capacity as a member of the UN, the Ukrainian SSR was an elected member of the United Nations Security Council in 1948–1949 and 1984–1985.

=== Khrushchev and Brezhnev: 1953–1985 ===

When Stalin died on 5 March 1953, the collective leadership of Khrushchev, Georgy Malenkov, Vyacheslav Molotov and Lavrentiy Beria took power and a period of de-Stalinization began. Change came as early as 1953, when officials were allowed to criticise Stalin&#x27;s policy of russification. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU) openly criticised Stalin&#x27;s russification policies in a meeting in June 1953. On 4 June 1953, Aleksey Kirichenko succeeded Leonid Melnikov as First Secretary of the CPU; this was significant since Kyrychenko was the first ethnic Ukrainian to lead the CPU since the 1920s. The policy of de-Stalinization took two main features, that of centralisation and decentralisation from the centre. In February 1954, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) transferred Crimea to Ukraine during the celebrations of the 300th anniversary of Ukraine&#x27;s reunification with Russia (Soviet name for the Pereiaslav Agreement). The massive festivities lasted throughout 1954, commemorating (), the treaty which brought Ukraine under Russian rule three centuries before. The event was celebrated to prove the old and brotherly love between Ukrainians and Russians, and proof of the Soviet Union as a &quot;family of nations&quot;; it was also another way of legitimising Marxism–Leninism. On 23 June 1954, the civilian oil tanker &quot;Tuapse&quot; of the Black Sea Shipping Company based in Odessa was hijacked by a fleet of Republic of China Navy in the high sea of &quot;19°35′N, 120°39′E&quot;, west of Balintang Channel near Philippines, whereas the 49 Ukrainian, Russian and Moldovan crew were detained by the Kuomintang regime in various terms up to 34 years in captivity with three deaths.

The &quot;Thaw&quot;the policy of deliberate liberalisationwas characterised by four points: amnesty for some convicted of state crime during the war or the immediate post-war years; amnesties for one-third of those convicted of state crime during Stalin&#x27;s rule; the establishment of the first Ukrainian mission to the United Nations in 1958; and the steady increase of Ukrainians in the rank of the CPU and government of the Ukrainian SSR. Not only were the majority of CPU Central Committee and Politburo members ethnic Ukrainians, three-quarters of the highest ranking party and state officials were ethnic Ukrainians too. The policy of partial Ukrainisation also led to a cultural thaw within Ukraine.
In October 1964, Khrushchev was deposed by a joint Central Committee and Politburo plenum and succeeded by another collective leadership, this time led by Leonid Brezhnev, born in Ukraine, as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Brezhnev&#x27;s rule would be marked by social and economic stagnation, a period often referred to as the Era of Stagnation. The new regime introduced the policy of &quot;rastsvet&quot;, &quot;sblizhenie&quot; and &quot;sliianie&quot; (&quot;flowering&quot;, &quot;drawing together&quot; and &quot;merging&quot;/&quot;fusion&quot;), which was the policy of uniting the different Soviet nationalities into one Soviet nationality by merging the best elements of each nationality into the new one. This policy turned out to be, in fact, the reintroduction of the russification policy.

=== Gorbachev and dissolution: 1985–1991 ===

Gorbachev&#x27;s policies of &quot;perestroika&quot; and &quot;glasnost&quot; (English: &quot;restructuring&quot; and &quot;openness&quot;) failed to reach Ukraine as early as other Soviet republics because of the influence of Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, a conservative communist appointed by Brezhnev and the First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party. The Chernobyl disaster of 1986, the russification policies, and the apparent social and economic stagnation led several Ukrainians to oppose Soviet rule. Gorbachev&#x27;s policy of &quot;perestroika&quot; was also never introduced into practice, 95 percent of industry and agriculture was still owned by the Soviet state in 1990. The talk of reform, but the lack of introducing reform into practice, led to confusion which in turn evolved into opposition to the Soviet state itself. The policy of &quot;glasnost&quot;, which ended state censorship, led the Ukrainian diaspora to reconnect with their compatriots in Ukraine, the revitalisation of religious practices by destroying the monopoly of the Russian Orthodox Church and led to the establishment of several opposition pamphlets, journals and newspapers.

Following the failed August Coup in Moscow on 19–21 August 1991, the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine declared independence on 24 August 1991 and renamed the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic as Ukraine. 

A referendum on independence was held on 1 December 1991. 92.3% of voters voted for independence nationwide. The referendum carried in the majority of all oblasts, including Crimea where 54% voted for independence, and those in Eastern Ukraine where more than 80% voted for independence.

In the 1991 Ukrainian presidential election held on the same day as the independence referendum, 62 percent of voters voted for Leonid Kravchuk, who had been vested with presidential powers since the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s declaration of independence.

On 8 December 1991, Ukraine (at Kravchuk&#x27;s direction), Russian and Belarus signed the Belovezh Accords which declared that the Soviet Union had effectively ceased to exist and founded the Commonwealth of Independent States as a quasi-replacement. On 21 December 1991, all the former Soviet republics (except Estonia, Georgia, Lithuania and Latvia) signed the Alma-Ata Protocol which reiterated that the Soviet Union had functionally ceased to exist. The Soviet Union formally dissolved on 26 December 1991.
== Politics and government ==
The Ukrainian SSR&#x27;s system of government was based on a one-party communist system ruled by the Communist Party of Ukraine, a branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (KPSS). The republic was one of 15 constituent republics composing the Soviet Union from its entry into the union in 1922 until its dissolution in 1991. All of the political power and authority in the USSR was in the hands of Communist Party authorities, with little real power being concentrated in official government bodies and organs. In such a system, lower-level authorities directly reported to higher level authorities and so on, with the bulk of the power being held at the highest echelons of the Communist Party.
Originally, the legislative authority was vested in the Congress of Soviets of Ukraine, whose Central Executive Committee was for many years headed by Grigory Petrovsky. Soon after publishing a Stalinist constitution, the Congress of Soviets was transformed into the Supreme Soviet (and the Central Executive Committee into its Presidium), which consisted of 450 deputies. The Supreme Soviet had the authority to enact legislation, amend the constitution, adopt new administrative and territorial boundaries, adopt the budget, and establish political and economic development plans. In addition, parliament also had to authority to elect the republic&#x27;s executive branch, the Council of Ministers as well as the power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court. Legislative sessions were short and were conducted for only a few weeks out of the year. In spite of this, the Supreme Soviet elected the Presidium, the Chairman, three deputy chairmen, a secretary, and couple of other government members to carry out the official functions and duties in between legislative sessions. Chairman of the Presidium was a powerful position in the republic&#x27;s higher echelons of power, and could nominally be considered the equivalent of head of state, although most executive authority would be concentrated in the Communist Party&#x27;s politburo and its First Secretary.

Full universal suffrage was granted for all eligible citizens aged 18 and over, excluding prisoners and those deprived of freedom. Although they could not be considered free and were of a symbolic nature, elections to the Supreme Soviet were contested every five years. Nominees from electoral districts from around the republic, typically consisting of an average of 110,000 inhabitants, were directly chosen by party authorities, providing little opportunity for political change, since all political authority was directly subordinate to the higher level above it.

With the beginning of Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;perestroika&quot; reforms towards the mid-late 1980s, electoral reform laws were passed in 1989, liberalising the nominating procedures and allowing multiple candidates to stand for election in a district. Accordingly, the first relatively free elections in the Ukrainian SSR were contested in March 1990. 111 deputies from the Democratic Bloc, a loose association of small pro-Ukrainian and pro-sovereignty parties and the instrumental People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (colloquially known as &quot;Rukh&quot; in Ukrainian) were elected to the parliament. Although the Communist Party retained its majority with 331 deputies, large support for the Democratic Bloc demonstrated the people&#x27;s distrust of the Communist authorities, which would eventually boil down to Ukrainian independence in 1991.

Ukraine is the legal successor of the Ukrainian SSR and it stated to fulfill &quot;those rights and duties pursuant to international agreements of Union SSR which do not contradict the Constitution of Ukraine and interests of the Republic&quot; on 5 October 1991. After Ukrainian independence the Ukrainian SSR&#x27;s parliament was changed from &quot;Supreme Soviet&quot; to its current name Verkhovna Rada, the Verkhovna Rada is still Ukraine&#x27;s parliament. Ukraine also has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the Soviet Union and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was stated in Articles 7 and 8 of On Legal Succession of Ukraine, issued in 1991. Following independence, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against the Russian Federation in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the Soviet Union. It also retained its seat in the United Nations, held since 1945.

=== Foreign relations ===

On the international front, the Ukrainian SSR, along with the rest of the 15 republics, had virtually no say in their own foreign affairs. However, since 1944, the Ukrainian SSR was permitted to establish bilateral relations with countries and maintain its own standing army. This clause was used to permit the republic&#x27;s membership in the United Nations, alongside the Byelorussian SSR. Accordingly, representatives from the &quot;Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot; and 50 other states founded the UN on 24 October 1945. In effect, this provided the Soviet Union (a permanent Security Council member with veto powers) with another two votes in the General Assembly. The latter aspect of the 1944 clauses was never fulfilled and the republic&#x27;s defense matters were managed by the Soviet Armed Forces and the Defense Ministry. Another right that was granted but never used until 1991 was the right of the Soviet republics to secede from the union, which was codified in each of the Soviet constitutions. Accordingly, Article 69 of the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR stated: &quot;The Ukrainian SSR retains the right to willfully secede from the USSR.&quot; However, a republic&#x27;s theoretical secession from the union was virtually impossible and unrealistic in many ways until after Gorbachev&#x27;s perestroika reforms.

The Ukrainian SSR was a member of the UN Economic and Social Council, UNICEF, International Labour Organization, Universal Postal Union, World Health Organization, UNESCO, International Telecommunication Union, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, World Intellectual Property Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency. It was not separately a member of the Warsaw Pact, Comecon, the World Federation of Trade Unions and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and since 1949, the International Olympic Committee.

== Administrative divisions ==

Legally, the Soviet Union and its fifteen union republics constituted a federal system, but the country was functionally a highly centralised state, with all major decision-making taking place in the Kremlin, the capital and seat of government of the country. The constituent republics were essentially unitary states, with lower levels of power being directly subordinate to higher ones. Throughout its 72-year existence, the administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR changed numerous times, often incorporating regional reorganisation and annexation on the part of Soviet authorities during World War II.

The most common administrative division was the oblast (province), of which there were 25 upon the republic&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Provinces were further subdivided into raions (districts) which numbered 490. The rest of the administrative division within the provinces consisted of cities, urban-type settlements, and villages. Cities in the Ukrainian SSR were a separate exception, which could either be subordinate to either the provincial authorities themselves or the district authorities of which they were the administrative center. Two cities, the capital Kiev, and Sevastopol (which hosted a large Soviet Navy base in Crimea), were uniquely designated &quot;cities with special status.&quot; This meant that they were directly subordinate to the central Ukrainian SSR authorities and not the provincial authorities surrounding them.

=== Historical formation ===

However, the history of administrative divisions in the republic was not so clear cut. At the end of World War I in 1918, Ukraine was invaded by Soviet Russia as the Russian puppet government of the Ukrainian SSR and without official declaration it ignited the Ukrainian–Soviet War. Government of the Ukrainian SSR from very start was managed by the Communist Party of Ukraine that was created in Moscow and was originally formed out of the Bolshevik organisational centers in Ukraine. Occupying the eastern city of Kharkov, the Soviet forces chose it as the republic&#x27;s seat of government, colloquially named in the media as &quot;Kharkov – Pervaya Stolitsa (the first capital)&quot; with implication to the era of Soviet regime. Kharkov was also the city where the first Soviet Ukrainian government was created in 1917 with strong support from Russian SFSR authorities. However, in 1934, the capital was moved from Kharkov to Kiev, which remains the capital of Ukraine today.

During the 1930s, there were significant numbers of ethnic minorities living within the Ukrainian SSR. National Districts were formed as separate territorial-administrative units within higher-level provincial authorities. Districts were established for the republic&#x27;s three largest minority groups, which were the Jews, Russians, and Poles. Other ethnic groups, however, were allowed to petition the government for their own national autonomy. In 1924 on the territory of Ukrainian SSR was formed the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Upon the 1940 conquest of Bessarabia and Bukovina by Soviet troops the Moldavian ASSR was passed to the newly formed Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, while Budzhak and Bukovina were secured by the Ukrainian SSR. Following the creation of the Ukrainian SSR significant numbers of ethnic Ukrainians found themselves living outside the Ukrainian SSR. In the 1920s the Ukrainian SSR was forced to cede several territories to Russia in Severia, Sloboda Ukraine and Azov littoral including such cities like Belgorod, Taganrog and Starodub. In the 1920s the administration of the Ukrainian SSR insisted in vain on reviewing the border between the Ukrainian Soviet Republics and the Russian Soviet Republic based on the 1926 First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union that showed that 4.5 millions of Ukrainians were living on Russian territories bordering Ukraine. A forced end to Ukrainisation in southern Russian Soviet Republic led to a massive decline of reported Ukrainians in these regions in the 1937 Soviet Census.

Upon signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Nazi Germany and Soviet Union partitioned Poland and its Eastern Borderlands were secured by the Soviet buffer republics with Ukraine securing the territory of Eastern Galicia. The Soviet September Polish campaign in Soviet propaganda was portrayed as the Golden September for Ukrainians, given the unification of Ukrainian lands on both banks of Zbruch River, until then the border between the Soviet Union and the Polish communities inhabited by Ukrainian speaking families.

== Economy ==

=== Before 1945 ===

At the onset of Soviet Ukraine, having largely inherited conditions from the Tsarist Empire, one of the biggest exporters of wheat in the world, the Ukrainian economy was still centered around agriculture, with over 90% of the workforce being peasants.

In the 1920s, Soviet policy in Ukraine attached importance to developing the economy. The initial agenda, War Communism, had prescribed total communisation and appropriation per quota of food from the people by force - further economic damage and a famine claiming up to one million lives ensued. With the New Economic Policy and the partial introduction of free markets, an economic recovery followed. After the death of Lenin and the consolidation of his power, Stalin was determined to industrialisation and reversed policy again. As heavy industry and wheat exports boomed, common people in rural areas were bearing a cost. Gradually escalating measures, from raised taxes, dispossession of property, and forced deportations into Siberia culminated in extremely high grain delivery quotas. Even though there is no evidence that agricultural yield could not feed the population at the time, four million Ukrainians were starved to death while Moscow exported over a million tonnes of grain to the West, decimating the population.

Within a decade, Ukraine&#x27;s industrial production had quintupled, mainly from facilities in the Donets Basin and central Ukrainian cities such as Mykolaiv.

=== After 1945 ===
==== Agriculture ====
In 1945, agricultural production stood at only 40 percent of the 1940 level, even though the republic&#x27;s territorial expansion had &quot;increased the amount of arable land&quot;. In contrast to the remarkable growth in the industrial sector, agriculture continued in Ukraine, as in the rest of the Soviet Union, to function as the economy&#x27;s Achilles heel. Despite the human toll of collectivisation of agriculture in the Soviet Union, especially in Ukraine, Soviet planners still believed in the effectiveness of collective farming. The old system was reestablished; the numbers of collective farms in Ukraine increased from 28 thousand in 1940 to 33 thousand in 1949, comprising 45 million hectares; the numbers of state farms barely increased, standing at 935 in 1950, comprising 12.1 million hectares. By the end of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (in 1950) and the Fifth Five-Year Plan (in 1955), agricultural output still stood far lower than the 1940 level. The slow changes in agriculture can be explained by the low productivity in collective farms, and by bad weather-conditions, which the Soviet planning system could not effectively respond to. Grain for human consumption in the post-war years decreased, this in turn led to frequent and severe food shortages.

The increase of Soviet agricultural production was tremendous, however, the Soviet-Ukrainians still experienced food shortages due to the inefficiencies of a highly centralised economy. During the peak of Soviet-Ukrainian agriculture output in the 1950s and early-to-mid-1960s, human consumption in Ukraine, and in the rest of the Soviet Union, actually experienced short intervals of decrease. There are many reasons for this inefficiency, but its origins can be traced back to the single-purchaser and -producer market system set up by Joseph Stalin. Khrushchev tried to improve the agricultural situation in the Soviet Union by expanding the total crop size – for instance, in the Ukrainian SSR alone &quot;the amount of land planted with corn grew by 600 percent&quot;. At the height of this policy, between 1959 and 1963, one-third of Ukrainian arable land grew this crop. This policy decreased the total production of wheat and rye; Khrushchev had anticipated this, and the production of wheat and rye moved to Soviet Central Asia as part of the Virgin Lands Campaign. Khrushchev&#x27;s agricultural policy failed, and in 1963 the Soviet Union had to import food from abroad. The total level of agricultural productivity in Ukraine decreased sharply during this period, but recovered in the 1970s and 1980s during Leonid Brezhnev&#x27;s rule.

==== Industry ====
During the post-war years, Ukraine&#x27;s industrial productivity doubled its pre-war level. In 1945 industrial output totalled only 26 percent of the 1940 level. The Soviet Union introduced the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1946. The Fourth Five-Year Plan would prove to be a remarkable success, and can be likened to the &quot;wonders of West German and Japanese reconstruction&quot;, but without foreign capital; the Soviet reconstruction is historically an impressive achievement. In 1950 industrial gross output had already surpassed 1940-levels. While the Soviet régime still emphasised heavy industry over light industry, the light-industry sector also grew. The increase in capital investment and the expansion of the labour force also benefited Ukraine&#x27;s economic recovery. In the prewar years, 15.9 percent of the Soviet budget went to Ukraine, in 1950, during the Fourth Five-Year Plan this had increased to 19.3 percent. The workforce had increased from 1.2 million in 1945 to 2.9 million in 1955; an increase of 33.2 percent over the 1940-level. The result of this remarkable growth was that by 1955 Ukraine was producing 2.2 times more than in 1940, and the republic had become one of the leading producers of certain commodities in Europe. Ukraine was the largest per-capita producer in Europe of pig iron and sugar, and the second-largest per-capita producer of steel and of iron ore, and was the third largest per-capita producer of coal in Europe.
From 1965 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, industrial growth in Ukraine decreased, and by the 1970s it started to stagnate. Significant economic decline did not become apparent before the 1970s. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan (1951–1955), industrial development in Ukraine grew by 13.5 percent, while during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985) industry grew by a relatively modest 3.5 percent. The double-digit growth seen in all branches of the economy in the post-war years had disappeared by the 1980s, entirely replaced by low growth-figures. An ongoing problem throughout the republic&#x27;s existence was the planners&#x27; emphasis on heavy industry over consumer goods.

The urbanisation of Ukrainian society in the post-war years led to an increase in energy consumption. Between 1956 and 1972, to meet this increasing demand, the government built five water reservoirs along the Dnieper River. Aside from improving Soviet-Ukrainian water transport, the reservoirs became the sites for new power stations, and hydroelectric energy flourished in Ukraine in consequence. The natural-gas industry flourished as well, and Ukraine became the site of the first post-war production of gas in the Soviet Union; by the 1960s Ukraine&#x27;s biggest gas field was producing 30 percent of the USSR&#x27;s total gas production. The government was not able to meet the people&#x27;s ever-increasing demand for energy consumption, but by the 1970s, the Soviet government had conceived an intensive nuclear power program. According to the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the Soviet government would build 8 nuclear power plants in Ukraine by 1989. As a result of these efforts, Ukraine became highly diversified in energy consumption.

== Religion ==
Many churches and synagogues were destroyed during the existence of the Ukrainian SSR.

== Urbanization ==
Urbanisation in post-Stalin Ukraine grew quickly; in 1959, only 25 cities in Ukraine had populations over one hundred thousand, by 1979 the number had grown to 49. During the same period, the growth of cities with a population over one million increased from one to five; Kiev alone nearly doubled its population, from 1.1 million in 1959 to 2.1 million in 1979. This proved a turning point in Ukrainian society: for the first time in Ukraine&#x27;s history, the majority of ethnic Ukrainians lived in urban areas; 53 percent of the ethnic Ukrainian population did so in 1979. The majority worked in the non-agricultural sector, in 1970 31 percent of Ukrainians engaged in agriculture, in contrast, 63 percent of Ukrainians were industrial workers and white-collar staff. In 1959, 37 percent of Ukrainians lived in urban areas, in 1989 the proportion had increased to 60 percent.

<text>David Roberts (24 October 179625 November 1864) was a Scottish painter. He is especially known for &quot;The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia&quot;, a prolific series of detailed lithograph prints of Egypt and the Near East that he produced from sketches he made during long tours of the region (1838–1840). These and his large oil paintings of similar subjects made him a prominent Orientalist painter. He was elected as a Royal Academician in 1841.

==Early life==

David Roberts was born at Edinburgh in Scotland, the eldest son of John Roberts and his wife Christian. Apprenticed for seven years to a house painter and decorator named Gavin Beugo, his fellow apprentice being David Ramsay Hay, who became a lifelong friend. During this time he studied art in the evenings. After his apprenticeship was complete, Roberts&#x27;s first paid job came in the summer of 1815, when he moved to Perth to serve as foreman for the redecoration of Scone Palace. Roberts returned in the spring of 1816 and lived with his parents while looking for work.

His next job was to paint scenery for James Bannister&#x27;s circus on North College Street. This was the beginning of his career as a painter and designer of stage scenery. Bannister liked Roberts&#x27;s set designs and on 10 April 1816 engaged him at a salary of 25 shillings per week to travel with the circus on a tour of England. Roberts departed Edinburgh with the circus later the same month and travelled to Carlisle, Newcastle, Hull and York, returning to Edinburgh in January 1817. During his time with the circus, Roberts was called on to take several minor stage roles as a foil for the clowns&#x27; skits.

For the first few months of 1817, Roberts worked as the stage designer&#x27;s assistant at the Pantheon Theatre, Edinburgh, a new joint venture between Bannister and an Italian musician named Corri. However the Pantheon was a financial failure and closed in May 1817, putting Roberts out of work. He reluctantly returned to house painting, working on the mansion house of Abercairny, near Perth, designed by Gillespie Graham. Although he was working from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. he took the opportunity to sketch in the woods around the mansion in the evening. He followed this up with a stint painting imitation wood and marble at a mansion at Condie, near Bridge of Earn, in Perthshire. At the urging of his parents, Roberts returned to Edinburgh in January 1818, where he took employment with John Jackson, a decorative painter. Working for Jackson during 1818, Roberts decorated Lord Lauderdale&#x27;s Dunbar House (known later as Lauderdale House) and then the library of Craigcrook Castle for Lord Jeffrey, who had recently leased the property.

In 1818, the Pantheon Theatre reopened in Edinburgh. Initially, a company from London with their own scene painters was in residence, but after they left, Roberts was able to get work from Corri as a scene painter. While Corri offered Roberts the position on 25 July 1818, he was already committed to house-painting work for Jackson and was unable to start at the Pantheon until the winter season. As there was no separate painting room, Roberts had to paint sets directly on the stage, which was occupied by rehearsals during the day and performances in the evening. Therefore, Roberts generally began work after the evening production had finished, working through the night. Roberts&#x27;s work was noticed by the stage-manager, Mr. Monro. After the Pantheon closed, Monro moved on to the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, where he arranged for Roberts to be hired as a principal scene-painter.

In 1819, Roberts became the scene painter at the Theatre Royal in Edinburgh (having at this time James Ballantine as his apprentice). There Roberts met the Scottish actress Margaret McLachlan, said to be the illegitimate daughter of a Highland gypsy girl and a clan chief. They married in 1820, &quot;for pure love&quot;. Although the marriage did not last long, it produced Roberts&#x27; only daughter, Christine, who was born in 1821.

Although he was making a living from scene painting, it was around this time that Roberts began to produce oil paintings seriously. In 1821 he became friends with the artist William Clarkson Stanfield, who joined him to paint scenery at the Theatre Royal, and Roberts developed his love of landscape painting. In 1821 the Fine Arts Institution of Edinburgh accepted three of Roberts&#x27;s paintings – views of Melrose and Dryburgh abbeys – two of which sold. At Stanfield&#x27;s suggestion, Roberts also sent three pictures to the 1822 Exhibition of Works by Living Artists, held in Edinburgh.

==Move to London==
In 1822 the Coburg Theatre, now the Old Vic in London, offered Roberts a job as a scenic designer and stage painter. He sailed from Leith with his wife and their six-month-old Christine and settled in London. After working for a while at the Coburg Theatre, Roberts moved to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane to create dioramas and panoramas with Stanfield.

A miniature by Roberts from this time shows Margaret as a delicate woman with blonde ringlets, holding the smiling three-year-old Christine. But Roberts&#x27; family life was not as idyllic as this picture suggests: Margaret had become an alcoholic, and eventually, in 1831, Roberts sent her back to Scotland to be cared for by friends. Roberts may have burned some letters from this period in shame at his wife&#x27;s drinking problem, but he was unusually frank in a letter to a friend, David Ramsay Hay. Roberts and Hay had been an apprentices together, and Hay had been seeing a mistress since his own wife had started drinking. &quot;If you do not know our cases are almost parallel. Yours is not as bad as mine, having some consolation. The state of my nerves is such I can scarcely write. But thank God she leaves tomorrow—I hope for ever.&quot;

In 1824, he exhibited another view of Dryburgh Abbey at the British Institution and sent two works to the first exhibition of the newly formed Society of British Artists. In the autumn of 1824 he visited Normandy. His paintings based on this trip began to lay the foundation of his reputation; one of them, a view of Rouen Cathedral, sold for 80 guineas.

While he built his reputation as a fine artist, Roberts&#x27;s stage work had also been commercially successful. Commissions from Covent Garden included the sets for the London premiere of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot; (The Abduction from the Seraglio) in 1827, scenery for a pantomime depicting the naval victory of Navarino, and two panoramas that he executed jointly with Stanfield.

During the second part of the 1820s, and in addition to English and Scottish scenes, Roberts painted views of prominent buildings in France and the Low Countries including Amiens, Caen, Dieppe, Rouen, Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent, sometimes making several paintings of the same scene with only minor variations.

By 1829 he was working full-time as a fine artist. That year, he exhibited the &quot;Departure of the Israelites from Egypt&quot;, in which his style first became apparent. In 1831, the Society of British Artists elected him as their president.

==Travel to Spain==

In 1832 he traveled in Spain and Tangiers. He returned at the end of 1833 with a supply of sketches that he elaborated into attractive and popular paintings. The British Institution exhibited his &quot;Interior of Seville Cathedral&quot; in 1834, and he sold it for £300. He executed a fine series of Spanish illustrations for the &quot;Landscape Annual&quot; of 1836. Then in 1837 a selection of his &quot;Picturesque Sketches in Spain&quot; was reproduced by lithography.

In London he made the acquaintance of artists such as Edward Thomas Daniell and John Linnell, who frequented Daniel&#x27;s house.

== Travel to Egypt and the Holy Land ==
J. M. W. Turner persuaded Roberts to abandon scene painting and devote himself to becoming a full-time artist. Roberts set sail for Egypt on 31 August 1838, a few years after Owen Jones. His intent was to produce drawings that he could later use as the basis for the paintings and lithographs to sell to the public. Egypt was much in vogue at this time, and travellers, collectors and lovers of antiquities were keen to buy works inspired by the East or depicting the great monuments of ancient Egypt.

Roberts made a long tour in Egypt, Nubia, the Sinai, the Holy Land, Jordan and Lebanon. Throughout, he produced a vast collection of drawings and watercolour sketches.

Muhammad Ali Pasha received Roberts in Alexandria on 16 May 1839, shortly before his return to the UK. He later reproduced this scene, apparently from memory, in Volume 3 of &quot;Egypt &amp; Nubia&quot;.

==Return to Britain==
Upon Roberts&#x27;s return to Edinburgh in 1840, his fellow-artist, Robert Scott Lauder, painted his portrait. (In 1980, the National Gallery of Scotland purchased the portrait.) Scottish society fêted him. For instance, he was the guest of honour at a dinner on 19 October 1842, at which Lord Cockburn presided.

On his return to Britain, Roberts worked with lithographer Louis Haghe from 1842 to 1849 to produce the lavishly illustrated plates of &quot;The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia&quot;, originally published as &quot;Sketches in the Holy Land and Syria, 1842–1849&quot; and &quot;Egypt &amp; Nubia&quot; series. He funded the work through advance subscriptions which he solicited directly. The scenery and monuments of Egypt and Holy Land were fashionable but had hitherto been hardly touched by British artists, and so Roberts quickly accumulated 400 subscription commitments, with Queen Victoria being subscriber No. 1. Her complete set is still in the Royal Collection. The timing of publication just before photographs of the sites became available proved fortuitous.

==Later life==
In 1851, and again in 1853, Roberts visited Italy, painting the &quot;Ducal Palace, Venice&quot;, bought by Lord Londesborough, the &quot;Interior of the Basilica of St Peters, Rome, Christmas Day, 1853&quot;, and &quot;Rome from the Convent of St Onofrio&quot;, presented to the Royal Scottish Academy. In 1853 he exhibited a picture painted by command of Queen Victoria, title the &#x27;Inauguration of the Exhibition of 1851,&#x27; it depicted the opening of the Great Exhibition of 1851 

His last volume of illustrations, &quot;Italy, Classical, Historical and Picturesque&quot;, was published in 1859. In 1839 he was elected an associate and in 1841 a full member of the Royal Academy; and in 1858 he was presented with the freedom of the city of Edinburgh. The last years of his life were occupied with a series of views of London from the Thames. He had executed six of these, and was at work upon a picture of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral as seen from Ludgate Hill, when he died suddenly. He collapsed on Berners Street on the afternoon of 25 November 1864 and died at home that evening. The symptoms, described as apoplexy in most histories, were those of a stroke.

He was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

<text>The Second Sea Lord and Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff (formerly Second Sea Lord) is deputy to the First Sea Lord and the second highest-ranking officer currently to serve in the Royal Navy and is responsible for personnel and naval shore establishments. Originally titled Second Naval Lord in 1830, the post was restyled &quot;Second Sea Lord&quot; in 1904. They are based at Navy Command, Headquarters.

==History==
In 1805, for the first time, specific functions were assigned to each of the &#x27;Naval&#x27; Lords, who were described as &#x27;Professional&#x27; Lords, leaving to the &#x27;Civil&#x27; Lords the routine business of signing documents. The Second Naval Lord was the second most senior Naval Lord on the Board of Admiralty and as Chief of Naval Personnel was responsible for handling all personnel matters for the Royal Navy. In 1917 the title was changed to the Second Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel by an order in council dated 23 October.

The posts of Second Sea Lord and Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command (CINCNAVHOME) were amalgamated in 1994 in the reductions of the British Armed Forces following the end of the Cold War. The original post of Commander-in-Chief, Naval Home Command had been created on 1 July 1969, as a result of the merger of the posts of Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth and Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth.

2SL is based in Portsmouth in a combined headquarters with the Fleet Commander on Whale Island. Until October 2012, he flew his flag from , the world&#x27;s oldest commissioned warship, which is preserved in dry dock in Portsmouth. The right to use HMS &quot;Victory&quot; as a flagship came from his position as CINCNAVHOME, who in turn acquired it from the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. Since October 2012, distinct Commander-in-Chief posts have been discontinued and full command responsibility is vested in the First Sea Lord, who now flies his flag from &quot;Victory&quot;; this change formed part of the Levene reforms which were implemented at that time.

In 2016 the post was retitled Second Sea Lord &amp; Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff and defined as &quot;responsible for the delivery of the Naval Service’s current and future personnel, equipment and infrastructure&quot;.

<doc id="376738" wikidata="Q43330" url="?curid=376738" title="Mikheil Saakashvili">
<text>Mikheil Saakashvili (; born 21 December 1967) is a Georgian and Ukrainian politician and jurist. He was the third president of Georgia for two consecutive terms from 25 January 2004 to 17 November 2013. He is the founder and former chairman of Georgia&#x27;s United National Movement party. From May 2015 until November 2016, Saakashvili was the governor of Ukraine&#x27;s Odesa Oblast. After resigning, he was temporarily exiled, but returned in 2019 under a new President. Saakashvili returned to Georgia in 2021, and has been imprisoned there since then.

Saakashvili entered Georgian politics in 1995 as a member of parliament and Minister of Justice under President Eduard Shevardnadze. He then founded the opposition United National Movement party. In 2003, as a leading opposition figure, he accused the government of rigging the 2003 Georgian parliamentary election, triggering mass street protests and President Shevardnadze&#x27;s ouster in the bloodless Rose Revolution. Saakashvili&#x27;s key role in the protests led to his election as President in 2004. He was reelected in 2008. However, his party lost the 2012 Georgian parliamentary election. Term limits meant he could not stand again, and an opposition candidate won the 2013 presidential election. 

As president, Saakashvili oversaw far-reaching reforms. His government fired and replaced the entire police force, hoping to root out corruption, and pursued a zero-tolerance policy towards crime. Its neoliberal economic policy abolished the minimum wage, and lowered corporate income tax from 20% to 15% and dividend tax from 10% to 5%. Several ministries were abolished and 60,000 civil servants dismissed, slashing government spending, although the military budget rose to 9.2% of GDP by 2007. In 2009, Forbes ranked Georgia&#x27;s tax burden as the fourth lowest in the world. GDP grew 70% between 2003 and 2013. Per-capita income roughly tripled, but by 2013 about a quarter of the population was still below the poverty line, even as international perceptions emphasised business-friendliness and reduced corruption.

The Abkhazian and Ossetian conflicts escalated in 2008. Russia officially announced its support for separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Saakashvili led Georgia through the five-day 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Georgia lost control of the disputed territories, and Russia recognized their independence. Georgia responded by breaking off diplomatic relations.

Saakashvili&#x27;s government responded violently to mass street demonstrations in 2007, triggered by the detention of politician Irakli Okruashvili; in 2009 led by Salome Zourabichvili, Nino Burjanadze, David Gamkrelidze and Eka Beselia; and in 2011, led again by Burjanadze. Saakashvili was embroiled in scandals and accused of being behind police brutality, such as the beating of opposition politician Valery Gelashvili, the murder of Sandro Girgvliani, and systemic torture and rape in the Georgian prison system. 

In late 2013, ex-President Saakashvili left Georgia. In 2014, the Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Georgia filed criminal charges against him. In 2018, the Tbilisi City Court sentenced him &quot;in absentia&quot; to six years in prison for ordering the beating of Valery Gelashvili and pardoning by prior agreement the individuals tried for Sandro Girgvliani&#x27;s murder. Saakashvili continued to manage his party from abroad while accusing the Georgian government of using the legal system for political retribution.

Saakashvili supported Ukraine&#x27;s Euromaidan movement and the Revolution of Dignity. On 30 May 2015, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko appointed him Governor of Odesa Oblast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted Ukrainian citizenship, thereby forfeiting his Georgian citizenship under Georgian law. In November 2016, Saakashvili resigned as governor while blaming Poroshenko personally for enabling corruption in Odesa and in Ukraine generally. Four days later, he launched a new Ukrainian political party called Movement of New Forces.

In July 2017, Saakashvili (then visiting the US) was stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship by President Poroshenko, and became stateless. He reentered Ukraine, but was arrested in February 2018 and deported. He was granted permanent residency in the Netherlands. In May 2019, he returned to Ukraine after newly-elected President Zelenskyy restored his citizenship. Zelenskyy appointed Saakashvili to lead Ukraine&#x27;s National Reform Council in May 2020.

In October 2021, Saakashvili announced his return to Georgia after an eight-year absence. Later the same day Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili announced that he had been arrested in Tbilisi. Investigators alleged he had entered Georgia illegally, bypassing the customs control. He was imprisoned in a penitentiary in Rustavi. 

In 2021, he began serving the six-year &quot;in absentia&quot; prison sentence imposed in 2018. President of Georgia Salome Zourabichvili stated that she would &quot;never&quot; pardon Saakashvili. He was often transferred to and from hospital for health reasons, and since May 2022 has been treated in a civilian clinic in Tbilisi.

==Early life and education==
Saakashvili was born in Tbilisi on 21 December 1967, capital of the then Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union. His father, Nikoloz Saakashvili, is a physician who practises medicine in Tbilisi and directs a local balneological centre. His mother, Giuli Alasania, is a historian who lectures at Tbilisi State University.

During university, he served his shortened military service in 1989–1990 with the Soviet Border Troops&#x27; checkpoint unit in the Boryspil Airport in Ukraine (then as Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, also a part of the Soviet Union). Saakashvili graduated from the Institute of International Relations (Department of International Law) of the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (in then independent Ukraine) in 1992. At this university, he was friends with later President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko. While in Ukraine Saakashvili participated in the October 1990 student protest known as the &quot;Revolution on Granite&quot;.

Saakashvili briefly worked as a human rights officer for the interim State Council of Georgia following the overthrow of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia before receiving a fellowship from the United States State Department (via the Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Fellowship Program). He received an LL.M. from Columbia Law School in 1994 and took classes at the School of International and Public Affairs and The George Washington University Law School the following year. In 1993, he also received a diploma from the International Institute of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.

==Election to Georgian Parliament==
Saakashvili interned at the United Nations. After graduation, while on internship in the New York law firm of Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler in early 1995, he was approached by Zurab Zhvania, an old friend from Georgia who was working on behalf of President Eduard Shevardnadze to enter politics. He stood in the December 1995 elections along with Zhvania, and both men won seats in parliament, standing for the Union of Citizens of Georgia, Shevardnadze&#x27;s party.

Saakashvili was chairman of the parliamentary committee which was in charge of creating a new electoral system, an independent judiciary and a non-political police force. Opinion surveys recognised him to be the second most popular person in Georgia, behind Shevardnadze. He was named &quot;man of the year&quot; by a panel of journalists and human rights advocates in 1997. In January 2000, Saakashvili was appointed vice-president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

On 12 October 2000, Saakashvili became Minister of Justice for the government of President Shevardnadze. He initiated major reforms in the Georgian criminal justice and prisons system. This earned praise from international observers and human rights activists. But, in mid-2001, he became involved in a major controversy with the State Security Minister Vakhtang Kutateladze and Tbilisi police chief Ioseb Alavidze, accusing them of profiting from corrupt business deals.

Saakashvili resigned on 5 September 2001, saying that &quot;I consider it immoral for me to remain as a member of Shevardnadze&#x27;s government.&quot; He declared that corruption had penetrated to the very centre of the Georgian government and that Shevardnadze lacked the will to deal with it, warning that &quot;current developments in Georgia will turn the country into a criminal enclave in one or two years.&quot;

==In the United National Movement==

Having resigned from the government and quit the Shevardnadze-run Union of Citizens of Georgia party, Saakashvili founded the United National Movement (UNM) in October 2001, a centre-right political party with a touch of nationalism, to provide a focus for part of the Georgian reformists leaders. In June 2002, he was elected as the Chairman of the Tbilisi Assembly (&quot;Sakrebulo&quot;) following an agreement between the United National Movement and the Georgian Labour Party. This gave him a powerful new platform from which to criticize the government.

Georgia held parliamentary elections on 2 November 2003 which were denounced by local and international observers as being grossly rigged. Saakashvilli claimed that he had won the elections (a claim supported by independent exit polls), and urged Georgians to demonstrate against Shevardnadze&#x27;s government and engage in nonviolent civil disobedience against the authorities. Saakashvili&#x27;s UNM and Burdjanadze-Democrats united to demand the ouster of Shevardnadze and the rerun of the elections.

Massive political demonstrations were held in Tbilisi in November, with over 100,000 people participating and listening to speeches by Saakashvili and other opposition figures. The Kmara (&quot;Enough!&quot;) youth organization (a Georgian counterpart of the Serbian &quot;Otpor!&quot;) and several NGOs, like Liberty Institute, were active in all protest activities. After an increasingly tense two weeks of demonstrations, Shevardnadze resigned as president on 23 November, to be replaced on an interim basis by parliamentary speaker Nino Burjanadze. While the revolutionary leaders did their best to stay within the constitutional norms, many called the change of government a popular coup dubbed by Georgian media as the Rose Revolution.

Saakashvili&#x27;s &quot;storming of Georgia&#x27;s parliament&quot; in 2003 &quot;put U.S. diplomats off guard... [Saakashvili] ousted a leader the U.S. had long backed, Eduard Shevardnadze.&quot; Seeking support, Saakashvili went outside the U.S. State Department. He hired Randy Scheunemann, then Sen. John McCain&#x27;s top foreign-policy adviser, as a lobbyist and used Daniel Kunin of and the as a full-time adviser.

On 24 February 2004, the &quot;United National Movement&quot; and the &quot;United Democrats&quot; had amalgamated. The new political movement was named the National Movement - Democrats (NMD). The movement&#x27;s main political priorities include raising pensions and providing social services to the poor, its main base of support; fighting corruption; and increasing state revenue.

==First presidency==
The 2004 presidential election followed President Eduard Shevardnadze&#x27;s resignation as a result of the bloodless Rose Revolution. It saw very high electoral turnout with almost all (96%) the votes cast for one candidate – Mikheil Saakashvili. 1,763,000 eligible voters took part, and less than 2% of the votes cast were for other candidates.

On 4 January 2004, aged 36, Saakashvili became the youngest national president in Europe at the time. On a platform of opposing corruption and increasing pay and pensions, he promised to improve relations with the outside world. Although strongly pro-Western and planning to seek Georgian membership of NATO and the European Union, he had also spoken of the importance of better relations with Russia. He faced major problems, however, particularly Georgia&#x27;s difficult economic situation and the still unresolved question of separatism in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Abkhazia regards itself as independent of Georgia and did not take part in the elections, while South Ossetia favours union with its northern counterpart in Russia.

Saakashvili was sworn in as president in Tbilisi on 25 January 2004. Immediately after the ceremony he signed a decree establishing a new state flag. On 26 January, in a ceremony held at the Tbilisi Kashueti Church of Saint George, he promulgated a decree granting permission for the return of the body of the first president of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, from Grozny (Chechen Republic) to Tbilisi and renaming a major road in the capital after Gamsakhurdia. He also released 32 Gamsakhurdia supporters (political prisoners) imprisoned by the Shevardnadze government in 1993–94. As well as a new national flag, Saakashivili authorised the adoption of a new national anthem on 20 May 2004 and a new state coat of arms on 1 October 2004.
In the first months of his presidency, Saakashvili faced a major political crisis in the southwestern Autonomous Republic of Adjara run by an authoritarian regional leader, Aslan Abashidze, who largely ignored the central Georgian government and was viewed by many as pro-Russian. The crisis threatened to develop into an armed confrontation, but Saakashvili&#x27;s government managed to resolve the conflict peacefully, forcing Abashidze to resign on 6 May 2004. Success in Adjara encouraged the new president to intensify his efforts towards returning the breakaway South Ossetia to Georgian jurisdiction. The separatist authorities responded with intense militarization. Armed clashes in August 2004 led to a stalemate, and a peace plan proposed by the Georgian government in 2005 did not resolve the conflict. In late July 2006, Saakashvili&#x27;s government dealt successfully with another major crisis, this time in Abkhazia&#x27;s Kodori Gorge where Georgia&#x27;s police forces disarmed a defiant militia led by a local warlord Emzar Kvitsiani. However, on 12 August 2008 Russo–Abkhazian forces once more gained control of the Upper Kodori Valley. 

In his foreign policy, Saakashvili maintained close ties with the US and other NATO countries, remaining one of the key partners of the GUAM organization. The Saakashvili-led Rose Revolution was described by the White House as one of the most powerful movements in the modern history that had inspired others to seek freedom.

===Economic and government reforms===
At the time Saakashvili took office, Georgia suffered from a stagnant economy, widespread corruption by police and state officials to the point where bribery was needed for any kind of commercial transaction, high crime rates, and severe infrastructure problems, including widespread power outages, and schools and medical facilities falling into disrepair. Saakashvili set out on a massive reform programme. He systematically fired politicians, public officials, and police officers suspected of corruption and significantly raised the salaries of state employees to the point where they could depend on their salaries rather than bribes for a living. Many oligarchs who had dominated the economy were arrested, with most agreeing to pay massive fines into the state budget in exchange for their freedom. Saakashvili appointed Kakha Bendukidze as the Minister of Economy to implement economic liberalization and rapidly reformed the economy by cutting red tape which had made business difficult, courting foreign investment, simplifying the tax code, launching a privatization campaign, and tackling widespread tax evasion. Due to the establishment of a functioning taxation and customs infrastructure, the state budget increased by 300% within three years. The government massively upgraded infrastructure and public services. In particular, water and power infrastructure was improved to the point where it functioned effectively, schools and hospitals were renovated, more roads were laid, and new housing developments were built.

As a result, the rate of corruption in the country was drastically reduced and the business environment was improved significantly. The economy began growing and the standard of living rose. Georgia&#x27;s ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index by Transparency International improved dramatically from rank 133 in 2004 to 67 in 2008 and further to 51 in 2012, surpassing several EU countries. The World Bank named Georgia as the leading economic reformer in the world, and the country ranked 8th in terms of &quot;ease of doing business&quot;- while most of the country&#x27;s neighbours are ranked somewhere in the hundreds. The World Bank noted a significant improvement in living conditions in Georgia, reporting that &quot;Georgia&#x27;s transformation since 2003 has been remarkable. The lights are on, the streets are safe, and public services are corruption free.&quot; Doing Business report founder Simeon Dyankov has given Georgia as an example to other reformers during the annual Reformer Awards.

Under Saakashvili&#x27;s term, Georgia became involved in international market transactions to a small extent, and in 2007 Bank of Georgia sold bonds at premium, when $200m five-year bond was priced with a coupon of 9 per cent at par, or 100 per cent of face value, after initially being priced at 9.5 per cent and investors pushed orders up to $600m.

In 2009, he introduced The Economic Liberty Act of Georgia, which was adopted by the Parliament of Georgia in 2011. The Act restricted the state&#x27;s ability to interfere in the economy, and was aimed at reducing the state expenses and debt by 30% and 60%, respectively. It also explicitly prohibited the Government from changing taxes without a popular referendum on rates and structure.

Due to his government&#x27;s economic reforms, Georgia&#x27;s economy grew 70% between 2003 and 2013, and per capita income roughly tripled. However, poverty only marginally declined. At the end of his second term, about a quarter of the population was still poor, and unemployment was at 15%.

===Law and order===
On 27 March 2006, the government announced that it had prevented a nationwide prison riot plotted by criminal kingpins. The police operation ended with the deaths of 7 inmates and at least 17 injuries. While the opposition cast doubts over the official version and demanded an independent investigation, the ruling party was able to vote down such initiatives.

Despite this, Saakashvili&#x27;s government also eased the legal system in some respects. His government decriminalized libel and pushed through legislation upholding freedom of speech, although he was accused of stifling the media and using the judicial system to go after his political opponents in spite of this. In December 2006, Saakashvili signed a constitutional amendment completely abolishing the death penalty in law.

===Military reforms===
Saakashvili&#x27;s government massively increased military spending to modernize the Georgian Armed Forces, which were small and poorly equipped and trained at the time he entered office. By 2007, the military budget had increased twenty-fold since 1999. New weapons and vehicles were purchased, military salaries were raised, new bases were built, and Georgian soldiers engaged in joint training exercises with the US military.

===Education reform===
When Saakashvili took office, the university entrance system was bribe-based, with a university spot costing up to $50,000 in 2003. His government introduced a common entrance exam, replacing the bribe-based system with a merit-based one. The quality of university education also improved. Despite this, Saakashvili was accused of failing to reform the quality of primary and secondary-level school education, which reportedly remained low at the end of his term in office.

===Health reforms===
After Georgian independence, the government found that its Soviet-style centralized healthcare system was underfunded and failing. State-run centralized medical facilities were typically inefficient and in need of renovation and technological upgrades. As a result, the government privatized almost all public hospitals and clinics, and the insurance system was deregulated, with private insurance companies able to offer coverage. Only a few specialized facilities for mental health and infectious diseases remained in government hands, and the state continued to provide health insurance for those below the poverty line, whose insurance was paid for by public funds and provided by private insurers, and some civil servants, amounting to about 40% of the population. As a result, the level of healthcare greatly improved, with new hospitals and clinics beginning to replace older facilities. However, a portion of the population was left uninsured, as it could not afford private insurance and did not qualify for public insurance.

===Foreign relations===

Saakashvili saw NATO membership as necessary for the stability of Georgia. He offered an intensified dialogue with the &quot;de facto&quot; Abkhaz and Ossetian authorities. Until the 2008 South Ossetia war, a diplomatic solution was thought possible. Saakashvili&#x27;s administration doubled the number of its troops in Iraq, making Georgia one of the biggest supporters of Coalition Forces, and keeping its troops in Kosovo and Afghanistan to &quot;contribute to what it describe[d] as global security&quot;.

Saakashvili&#x27;s government maintained diplomatic relations with other Caucasian states and western-oriented nearby countries such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine. In 2004, Saakashvili visited Israel to attend the official opening of the Modern Energy Problems Research Center, and Dr. Brenda Schaffer, the director of the centre, described Saakashvili as the Nelson Mandela of the 21st century. That August, Saakashvili, who holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Haifa, travelled to Israel again to attend the opening of the official Week of Georgian-Jewish Friendship, held under the auspices of the Georgian president, for which the Jewish leaders were invited as honoured guests.

Relations with the United States were good, but were complicated by Saakashvili&#x27;s &quot;volatile&quot; behaviour. Former and current US officials characterized the Georgian president as &quot;difficult to manage&quot;. They criticized his &quot;risky moves&quot;, that had often &quot;caught the U.S. unprepared&quot; while leaving it &quot;exposed diplomatically&quot;.

Saakashvili&#x27;s ties with the US go back to 1991 (see Early life and career). Biographies of Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy could be found in his office, next to biographies of Joseph Stalin and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and books on war. Seeking US support, Saakashvili went outside the United States Department of State and established contacts with Sen. John McCain and forces seeking NATO expansion.

Saakashvili believed that the long-term priority for the country was to advance its membership in the European Community. During a meeting with Javier Solana, he said that, in contrast with new and old European states, Georgia is an Ancient European state.

===Assassination attempt===
On 10 May 2005, while U.S. President George W. Bush was giving a speech in Tbilisi&#x27;s Freedom Square, Vladimir Arutyunian threw a live hand grenade at where Saakashvili and Bush were sitting. It landed in the crowd about from the podium after hitting a girl and did not detonate. Arutyunian was arrested in July of that year, but before his capture, he managed to kill one law enforcement agent. He was convicted of the attempted assassinations of Saakashvili and Bush and the murder of the agent, and given a life sentence.

===2007 crisis===

The late Georgian businessman Badri Patarkatsishvili claimed that pressure had been exerted on his financial interests after Imedi Television broadcast several accusations against officials. On 25 September 2007, former defence minister Irakli Okruashvili accused the president of planning Patarkatsishvili&#x27;s murder. Okruashvili was detained two days later on charges of extortion, money laundering, and abuse of office. However, on 8 October 2007 the General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office released a videotaped confession, in which Okruashvili pleaded guilty to large-scale bribery through extortion and negligence while serving as minister. He also retracted his accusations against the president and said that he made them to gain political benefit at the request of Badri Patarkatsishvili. Okruashvili&#x27;s lawyer and other opposition leaders said this retraction had been made under duress.

Georgia faced the worst crisis since the Rose Revolution. Okruashvili&#x27;s accusations against the president and his allies sparked a series of anti-government demonstrations in October, climaxing early in November. They involved several opposition groups and the influential media tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili. Although the demonstrations rapidly faded, the government&#x27;s decision to use police force against the remaining protesters evolved into clashes in the streets of Tbilisi on 7 November. The President&#x27;s declaration of a state of emergency (7–16 November) and the restrictions imposed on some mass media sources led to harsh criticism of the Saakashvili government both in Georgia and abroad. Human Rights Watch criticized the Georgian government for using &quot;excessive&quot; force against protesters in November and International Crisis Group warned of growing authoritarianism.

Patarkatsishvili&#x27;s opposition television station, Imedi, was shut down in November 2007, after the authorities accused it of complicity with the plot to overthrow the elected government. It resumed broadcasts a few weeks after the incident, but did not broadcast news or talk shows until after the election. The station was later sold to supporters of the Saakashvili government and some Georgian journalists have called for it to be handed back.

On 8 November 2007, President Saakashvili announced a compromise solution to hold early presidential elections on 5 January 2008. He also proposed to hold a simultaneous plebiscite about when to hold parliamentary polls – in spring as pushed for by the opposition parties, or in late 2008. Several concessions in the election code were also made to the opposition.

On 23 November 2007, the ruling United National Movement party officially nominated Saakashvili as its candidate for the upcoming elections. Pursuant to the Constitution of Georgia, Saakashvili resigned on 25 November to launch his pre-election campaign for early presidential polls.

==Second presidency==
===2008 presidential election===

On 5 January 2008, an early presidential election was held nationwide, with the exception of the highland village of Shatili, where the polling station was not opened due to high levels of snowfall. In a televised address, President Saakashvili had proposed to hold the election earlier than called for by the Georgian constitution in order to resolve the political tension surrounding opposition-led demonstrations, their suppression by the government on 7 November 2007, and the closure of the most popular opposition television network, Imedi. Saakashvili said in his presidential address that &quot;these elections will be held according to our timing, and not that of our ill-wishers.&quot;

===Changes in the Cabinet===
Saakashvili publicly announced his plans of modernising the Cabinet of Georgia well before Georgian presidential elections. Shortly after being re-elected, the president formally re-appointed the Prime Minister of Georgia Lado Gurgenidze and asked him to present a renewed cabinet to the Parliament of Georgia for final approval.

Gurgenidze changed most ministers, leaving Ivane Merabishvili, controversial Minister for Home Affairs, Defence Minister Davit Kezerashvili and Minister of Finance Nika Gilauri on their former positions. Gia Nodia was appointed as the Minister of Education and Science. Zaza Gamcemlidze, former director of Tbilisi Botanic Garden, took over the position of the Minister of Natural Resources and Nature Protection. Famous archaeologist, and already the eldest minister in the cabinet, Iulon Gagoshidze was appointed on a newly designated position of the Minister of State for Diasporas.

Parliamentary elections held during Saakashvili&#x27;s second term were condemned by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe election monitoring mission for being marred by ballot stuffing, violence against opposition campaigners, uncritical coverage of the president and his party from the state-controlled media, and public officials openly campaigning for the president&#x27;s party.

On 28 October 2008, Saakashvili proposed Grigol Mgaloblishvili, Georgian ambassador to Turkey for the premiership. According to the President, Gurgenidze had initially agreed to serve only for a year and that Georgia was facing new challenges which needed new approach. The Parliament of Georgia approved Mgaloblishvili as the premier on 1 November 2008.

Demonstrations against Saakashvili spread across Georgia in 2009, 2011 and 2012.

===Russo-Georgian War===

On 22 February 2008, Saakashvili held an official meeting with the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, in his residence in Novo-Ogaryovo. The presidents discussed the issues of aviation regulations between the two countries. This was Putin&#x27;s last meeting in his second term as the President of Russia, being succeeded by Dimitry Medvedev shortly thereafter.

However, after a series of clashes between Georgians and South Ossetians, Russian military forces intervened on the side of the South Ossetian separatists in response to the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali and invaded Gori in Shida Kartli. The two counterparts were led to a ceasefire agreement and a six-point peace plan, due to the French President&#x27;s mediation. On 26 August 2008, the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, signed a decree recognizing Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states. Also on 26 August, in response to Russia&#x27;s recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigol Vashadze announced that Georgia had broken diplomatic relations with Russia.

Medvedev held Saakashvili responsible for the Russo-Georgian War, and states that Saakashvili is responsible for the collapse of the Georgian state.

The Georgian military&#x27;s capabilities were severely damaged by the war, and Saakashvili&#x27;s government moved to rebuild them, massively increasing military spending. By late 2010, the Georgian military reached a strength greater than that of pre-war levels, after which military spending declined again. Although the Georgian government bought large amounts of arms and military equipment from abroad, it also began to seriously invest in an indigenous military industry. Starting in 2010, Georgia began to manufacture its own line of armoured vehicles, artillery systems, small arms, and unmanned aerial vehicles.

===2009 opposition demonstrations and armed mutiny===
The pressure against Saakashvili intensified in 2009, when the opposition launched mass demonstrations against Saakashvili&#x27;s rule. On 5 May 2009, Georgian police said large-scale disorders were planned in Georgia of which the failed army mutiny was part. According to the police, Saakashvili&#x27;s assassination had also been plotted. Opposition figures dispute the claim of an attempted mutiny and instead say that troops refused an illegal order to use force against opposition demonstrators.

===End of presidency===

On 2 October 2012, Saakashvili admitted defeat in Georgia&#x27;s parliamentary election against Bidzina Ivanishvili in the election the day before. He was barred from seeking a third term in the 2013 presidential election. Saakashvili left Georgia shortly after the election.

In December 2013, Saakashvili accepted the position of lecturer and senior statesman at Tufts University in the United States.

=== Legal prosecution (in Georgia) since the end of presidency ===
On 23 March 2014, when Saakashvili was summoned to give testimony to the main prosecutor&#x27;s office of Georgia, the office planned to interrogate him about the pardoning in 2008 of four high-ranking officials of the Department of Constitutional Security of the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs – Gia Alania, Avtandil Aptsiauri, Alexander Gachava and Mikhail Bibiluridze, who were convicted for causing the death of bank employee Sandro Girgvliani on 28 January 2006, as well as for unlawful actions against his friend Levan Bukhaidze. He was also to be questioned as a witness for nine criminal cases, including the death of the Prime Minister of Georgia Zurab Zhvania in 2005.

On 28 July 2014, criminal charges were filed by the Georgian prosecutor&#x27;s office against Saakashvili over allegedly &quot;exceeding official powers&quot; during the 2007 Georgian demonstrations, as well as a police raid on and &quot;seizure&quot; of Imedi TV and other assets owned by the late tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili. Saakashvili, then in Hungary, responded by accusing the Georgian authorities of political score-settling and attempts at appeasing Russia. The United States expressed concerns over the case and warned that &quot;the legal system should not be used as a tool of political retribution&quot;. The European Union stated that it took &quot;note with concern&quot; and it will &quot;closely monitor these and other legal proceedings against members of the former government and current opposition in Georgia&quot;.

On 2 August 2014, Tbilisi City Court ordered pre-trial detention in absentia for Saakashvili and the co-accused Zurab Adeishvili (chief prosecutor in 2007) and Davit Kezerashvili (defense minister in 2007), with a preliminary hearing appointed for September 2014.

On 13 August 2014, Saakashvili was charged with embezzling budget funds. On 14 August, an internal search was declared, and on 31 August, the procedure for declaring an international search was launched. On 1 August 2015, Interpol refused to declare Saakashvili on the international wanted list, as the Georgian authorities demanded. In September, the property of the Saakashvili family was seized. His personal bank accounts in Georgia were also seized.

In March 2015, Ukraine denied a Georgian request to extradite Saakashvili, as it deemed the criminal cases against him politically motivated.

Saakashvili stated on 1 June 2015 that he had given up (three days before) Georgian citizenship to avoid &quot;guaranteed imprisonment&quot; in Georgia. The Constitution of Ukraine forbids the extradition of Ukrainians to other states.

On 8 August 2017, the Georgian General Prosecutor&#x27;s Office claimed Saakashvili would face up to 11 years of imprisonment (charges included the spending of public funding on personal needs, abuse of power during the dispersal of a demonstration on 7 November 2007, the beating of former MP Valery Gelashvili and the raid of Imedi TV). 
On 18 August 2017, Georgia requested Ukraine to extradite Saakashvili. On 5 September, the Ukrainian authorities confirmed that they had received the request from Georgia.

On 5 January 2018, the Tbilisi City Court sentenced Saakashvili to three-year imprisonment in absentia for abusing power in pardoning the former Interior Ministry officials convicted in the 2006 Sandro Girgvliani murder case. On 28 June 2018, the Tbilisi City Court found Saakashvili guilty of abusing his authority as president by trying to cover up evidence related to the 2005 beating of opposition lawmaker Valery Gelashvili and sentenced him in absentia to six years in prison. Saakashvili and his supporters denounced the verdict as politically motivated.

After returning to Georgia in 2021, Saakashvili was additionally charged for illegal border crossing.

==Ukraine==
Saakashvili energetically supported Ukraine&#x27;s Euromaidan movement and its Revolution of Dignity. On 7 March 2014, Saakashvili authored an op-ed piece entitled &quot;When Putin invaded my country&quot;, in the context of the turmoil in Ukraine after the ouster on 22 February of President Viktor Yanukovych and before the 16 March referendum in the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.

In November 2013, Saakashvili moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York.

===Governor of Odesa===
On 13 February 2015, Saakashvili was appointed by the president of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, as head of the International Advisory Council on Reforms—an advisory body whose main task is working out proposals and recommendations for implementation and introduction of reforms in Ukraine based on best international practices. On 30 May 2015, Poroshenko appointed Saakashvili Governor of Odesa Oblast (region). On the previous day, 29 May 2015, he was granted Ukrainian citizenship. A month before this appointment, Saakashvili had stated that he had turned down the post of First Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine because in order to fulfill that post, he would have had to become a Ukrainian citizen and renounce his Georgian citizenship. Saakashvili stated on 1 June 2015 that he had now changed his mind to avoid &quot;guaranteed imprisonment&quot; in Georgia and to defend Georgian interest through his governorship in Odesa. Also on 1 June, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia stated that the appointment of Saakashvili would not have a negative impact on the relations between Georgia and Ukraine. But in reality, after this appointment, relations between the two countries soured. On 4 December 2015, Saakashvili was stripped of his Georgian citizenship due to restrictions on dual nationality under Georgian law. Saakashvili claimed that this was done to prevent him from leading the United National Movement in the 2016 Georgian parliamentary election.

A poll by Sociological group &quot;RATING&quot; showed that in October 2015, Saakashvili was the most popular politician in Ukraine (43% viewed him positively).

In December 2015, Saakashvili started an anti-corruption NGO &quot;Movement for Purification&quot;. Among rumours that this NGO would be transformed into a political force, Saakashvili stated he did not have the intention to create a new political party. In the autumn of 2015, informal attempts and negotiations were launched to form a political party around Saakashvili with members of the parliamentary group Interfactional Union &quot;Eurooptimists&quot;, Democratic Alliance and possibly Self Reliance, but this project collapsed in June 2016.

Saakashvili submitted his resignation as governor on 7 November 2016 citing corruption in Ukraine as a main reason. In a press conference this same day, he claimed that President Poroshenko personally supported &quot;corruption clans in the Odesa region&quot; and that the &quot;Odesa region is being handed over not only to corrupt people, but also to enemies of Ukraine.&quot; On 9 November 2016, President Poroshenko accepted Saakashvili&#x27;s resignation (as governor) and dismissed him as his freelance adviser.

===Movement of New Forces===

On 11 November 2016, Saakashvili announced his goal to create a new political party called &quot;Movement of New Forces&quot; and that &quot;our goal is early parliamentary elections to be carried out as quickly as possible in the shortest possible time.&quot; In late February 2017, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine registered Movement of New Forces officially as a political party.

According to a poll by Sociological group &quot;RATING&quot;, 18% viewed Saakashvili positively in April 2017.

In Ukraine, only Ukrainian citizens can lead political parties or be elected to its parliament.

===Stripping of Ukrainian citizenship===
On 26 July 2017, President Poroshenko issued a decree stripping Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship, but without a reason for his doing so being stated. Ukraine&#x27;s migration service said in a statement that &quot;according to the Constitution of Ukraine, the president takes decisions on who is stripped of Ukrainian citizenship based on the conclusions of the citizenship commission&quot;. Saakashvili, in response to his being stripped of citizenship, replied: &quot;I have only one citizenship, that of Ukraine, and I will not be deprived of it! Now there is an attempt under way to force me to become a refugee. This will not happen! I will fight for my legal right to return to Ukraine!&quot; A Ukrainian legislator from the Petro Poroshenko Bloc faction in parliament, Serhiy Leshchenko, said that Saakashvili was (when Poroshenko issued his decree) in the United States, but that if he sought to return to Ukraine, he would face extradition to Georgia to face charges for alleged crimes that occurred during his presidency there. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, most observers saw Poroshenko&#x27;s stripping Saakashvili of his citizenship &quot;simply as the sidelining of a political rival&quot; (at the time political polls gave Saakashvili&#x27;s political party Movement of New Forces around 2% in a hypothetical early election). On 28 July 2017, Saakashvili told &quot;Newshour&quot; he wanted to return to Ukraine to &quot;get rid of the old corrupt elite&quot; there.

On 4 August, Saakashvili appeared in Poland; he left the country 4 days later travelling to Lithuania claiming &quot;I&#x27;ll be travelling across Europe.&quot; Saakashvili announced on 16 August that he will return to Ukraine on 10 September (2017) through the Krakovets checkpoint and urged people to meet him at the checkpoint.

On 10 September, the train on which Saakashvili tried to enter Ukraine was held at a railway station in Przemysl, Poland. Then, on the same day, he travelled by bus to the Medyka-Shehyni border crossing, where he was allowed to pass through a Polish checkpoint on the border with Ukraine, but then temporarily blocked from reaching the Ukrainian checkpoint by a line of border guards standing arm-in-arm. Finally, a crowd broke through from the Ukrainian side and took Saakashvili into Ukraine. On 12 September, in the Leopolis Hotel in Lviv, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine acquainted Saakashvili with the protocol on the administrative violation of &quot;Illegal crossing or attempted illegal crossing of the state border of Ukraine.&quot;

At a rally in the western Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi on 13 September, Saakashvili announced that he would return to Kyiv on 19 September after travelling to several other cities to rally support.

On 22 September, the Mostysky District Court of the Lviv region found Saakashvili guilty of illegally crossing the state border. Under the court&#x27;s decision, he must pay a fine of 200 non-taxable minimums (3400 hryvni).

In the first half of 2017, and in December 2018 and January 2019, Saakashvili hosted political talk shows on the TV channel &quot;Zik&quot;. Saakashvili claims his programme was axed in 2019 because his view on Yulia Tymoshenko&#x27;s candidacy for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election was distorted (he claimed to support her candidacy while his TV show suggested the exact opposite).

===Legal prosecution (in Ukraine)===
On 5 December 2017, Saakashvili (who was leading anti-government protests at the time) was temporarily detained by Ukraine&#x27;s Security Service on the roof of his apartment building in central Kyiv and his apartment was searched. He was freed from police by a large group of protesters. Saakashvili&#x27;s lawyer reported that the politician had been detained for attempting to overthrow Ukraine&#x27;s constitutional system, whilst the SBU accused Saakashvili of receiving financing from a &quot;criminal group&quot; linked to ousted (during the Revolution of Dignity) Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. On 8 December, General Prosecutor of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko announced that National Police officers had found the location of Saakashvili, detained him and placed him in a temporary detention centre. The following day, Saakashvili began an indefinite hunger strike, claiming to oppose any attempts at compulsory feeding. On 11 December, a Ukrainian court released him from detention.

On 12 February 2018, Saakashvili was deported to Poland. The Ukrainian border service stated &quot;This person was on Ukrainian territory illegally and therefore, in compliance with all legal procedures, he was returned to the country from where he arrived&quot;. Saakashvili was subsequently banned from entering Ukraine until 2021 by the Ukrainian border service. Saakashvili claimed that his Georgian bodyguards and supporters had in recent months been kidnapped, tortured and deported to Georgia. On 14 February 2018, Saakashvili showed up in the Netherlands, having been granted permanent residency there on the basis of family reunification.

===Return to Ukraine===

In May 2019, Ukraine&#x27;s new president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, restored Saakashvili&#x27;s Ukrainian citizenship. On 29 May 2019, Saakashvili returned to Ukraine; but he soon stated that he had no political ambitions in Ukraine.

On 4 June, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko offered Saakashvili to join the leadership of his UDAR party and to take part in the July 2019 early parliamentary elections. Saakashvili turned down the offer. In these elections Saakashvili headed the party list of Movement of New Forces. The party received 0.46% of the total votes and no seats. Two days before the election, Saakashvili had called on his supporters to vote for the Servant of the People party at the election. (Servant of the People won the election with 43.16% of the votes.)

Saakashvili wrote on his Facebook page on 22 April 2020 that he had received a proposal from President Zelenskyy to become Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine for reforms in the Shmyhal Government. Saakashvili told the Financial Times newspaper: &quot;The president wants me to be in charge of talks with the IMF … I have experience.&quot; The Ukrainian parliament did not consider the issue at its meetings on 24 and 30 April 2020. On 7 May 2020, President Zelenskyy appointed Saakashvili head of the executive committee of the .

==Political activity in Georgia since the end of presidency==

After stepping down as President in 2013, Saakashvili still remained an influential figure in Georgian politics. He continued to manage the United National Movement party from abroad, while accusing the Georgian government of using the legal system as a tool of political retribution.

Ahead of the 2016 Georgian parliamentary election, Saakashvili said that he was confident that &quot;we [the United National Movement] are winning the election&quot; and promised to return to Georgia and take part in forming a new government. Founder of the ruling Georgian Dream party Bidzina Ivanishvili accused Saakashvili of planning to stir disorders, which Saakashvili denied and in turn accused Ivanishvili of &quot;blaming opponents for what he himself is planning&quot;. On 26 September 2016, Saakashvili addressed his supporters at the United National Movement&#x27;s campaign rally in Zugdidi via video link from Odesa, telling them that &quot;the victory is inevitable&quot;. Saakashvili&#x27;s wife Sandra Roelofs said that Saakashvili would return to Georgia to celebrate the victory. Meanwhile, members of the UNM-affiliated group, Free Zone, held press briefing in Tbilisi, accusing Saakashvili of instructing the leader of the organization Koba Khabazi to prepare for staging disorders. In response to allegations, the State Security Service of Georgia launched an investigation into charges of sabotage. Other members of the Free Zone distanced themselves from these claims and in turn accused the defecting group of being under influence of the State Security Service.

On 27 September 2016, a recording was uploaded on YouTube, purportedly of a call between Mikheil Saakashvili and other UNM leaders discussing the need to pursue a &quot;revolutionary scenario&quot;. The State Security Service launched an investigation into charges of &quot;conspiracy to overthrow or to seize state power&quot;. Saakashvili denied the authenticity of the conversation and accused Bidzina Ivanishvili of trying to &quot;avoid unavoidable defeat&quot;.

On 4 October 2016, Saakashvili accused Ivanishvili of being behind the explosion of car belonging to United National Movement MP Givi Targamadze, alleging that Ivanishvili was trying to &quot;get rid of&quot; Targamadze because he &quot;has been keeping active contacts with the law enforcement [officers], which scares Ivanishvili very much&quot;.

On 5 October 2016, Saakashvili addressed his supporters via video link in Tbilisi, saying that three days were left before his return to Georgia.

After elections, Saakashvili said that they were held &quot;with gross violations&quot;, calling his supporters to protest. Saakashvili also expressed his support for boycotting the Parliament, a step which other leaders of the United National Movement described as a &quot;suicide for the party&quot;. On 4 November, the UNM&#x27;s political council rejected Saakashvili&#x27;s calls to boycott. Saakashvili slammed the decision and said that he had no desire to maintain contact with &quot;one or two whimsical persons&quot; from UNM, accusing them of &quot;prescribing defeat&quot; for the party. On 1 December, the political council voted to hold a congress in January to elect a new chairman. Saakashvili lost his right to be UNM&#x27;s chairman in June 2015, when he was deprived of Georgian citizenship because under Georgian legislation only Georgian citizens can chair political parties in Georgia. Since then, this position remained vacant. Some influential members of the party expressed support for further leaving the position vacant to avoid distancing the party from Mikheil Saakashvili and said that they would raise the issue on congress. Saakashvili supported the idea of holding congress, while some members of the party, under the leadership of Giga Bokeria and Davit Bakradze, accused Saakashvili of &quot;hijacking&quot; the congress organization in circumvention of the political council.

On 12 January 2017, one week before the congress, the United National Movement officially announced splitting. Members of the party who opposed boycotting the parliament and supported electing a new party chair opted to set up their own party. The breakaway entity took the largely unknown legal vehicle of a previous party European Georgia. A majority of the UNM&#x27;s electoral list defected to European Georgia faction in the parliament, leaving the UNM with six members in parliament. Saakashvili thanked loyal members of the party for opposing efforts to &quot;distance me from the party&quot; and what he called &quot;Ivanishvili&#x27;s attempt to take over the United National Movement&quot;. He voiced the common belief among the UNM voters that these defections were encouraged by the ruling Georgian Dream Coalition in order to weaken its opposition. On 20 January, the UNM congress supported the proposal not to elect the party chairman until Mikheil Saakashvili would return to Georgia. The European Georgia members accused the UNM of &quot;betraying the values of Rose Revolution&quot; and turning to populism. In an interview with the online news website Netgazeti, Giorgi Ugulava distinguished the EG as being more liberal than the UNM, specifically describing the UNM as populist and communitarian.

The UNM had no official chairman until 24 March 2019, when Saakashvili was succeeded as the UNM party&#x27;s chairman by his own nominee, Grigol Vashadze.

== Return to Georgia ==
Prior to 2021 Georgian local elections, Saakashvili promised his supporters to return to Georgia.

Nevertheless, Saakashvili&#x27;s statements stirred significant controversy in Georgia, with high-ranking Georgian officials saying that Saakashvili would be arrested and sent to prison for his crimes. These statements were made on the basis of Tbilisi City Court decisions in 2018, which condemned Saakashvili for six years in prison for abuse of power, embezzlement and his role in the organization of a grievous bodily injury against an opposition lawmaker Valery Gelashvili. Saakashvili and his supporters denounced these verdicts as politically motivated.

On 1 October 2021, Saakashvili claimed to have returned to Georgia after an eight-year absence, and called on his followers to march on the capital, Tbilisi. He published a video on Facebook, claiming that he was in Batumi. The Georgian police, however, claimed that Saakashvili had not crossed the country&#x27;s border. Irakli Kobakhidze, chairman of the Georgian ruling party Georgian Dream, said that the video was &quot;deepfake&quot; and urged the voters to remain calm. Mamuka Mdinaradze, one of the leaders of Georgian Dream, claimed: &quot;He [Saakashvili] is in Ukraine, we have specific information that this person did not leave Ukraine, did not go to another country, this person is in Ukraine, he is trapped somewhere in a hole, he hides from everyone to create the illusion that he is in Georgia&quot;.

The video was shared and discussed on social media, before the story began to appear on Georgia&#x27;s TV channels. For several hours, both pro-government and opposition TV channels actively engaged in the debate over Saakashvili&#x27;s alleged homecoming video and whereabouts. At the same time, pro-Saakashvili Mtavari Arkhi TV featured a news program titled &quot;Saakashvili is in Georgia&quot;, while pro-government Imedi TV featured a news program titled &quot;Saakashvili is in Ukraine&quot;. Georgia&#x27;s Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that special forces were sent to Batumi in operation to detain Saakashvili.

A few moments later, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Gharibashvili announced at a briefing together with the Minister of Internal Affairs Vakhtang Gomelauri and the head of the State Security Service Grigol Liluashvili that Mikheil Saakashvili was under arrest. Soon a video was published featuring handcuffed Saakashvili being taken into prison N12 in Rustavi. According to the investigation, Saakashvili entered the country secretly, hiding in a semi-trailer truck loaded with milk products. He illegally crossed the state border of Georgia, bypassing the customs control. He was arrested in Tbilisi by the police and taken to the prison in Rustavi.

President of Georgia Salome Zourabichvili stated that she would &quot;never&quot; pardon Saakashvili. On 3 November 2021 Zourabichvili confirmed her first statement again.

Saakashvili began a hunger strike in protest of what he considered as the state&#x27;s refusal to give him a fair trial on charges which he thought would &quot;destroy him and Georgia&quot;. On 10 October 2021, his personal doctor asked authorities to move him to hospital as he continued with his hunger strike since his arrest and his health condition had allegedly worsened.

On 14 October 2021, tens of thousands protested on Tbilisi&#x27;s Rustaveli Avenue, demanding the release of Saakashvili from prison. Nika Melia, a leader of the United National Movement, came under criticism for ending a demonstration without presenting a plan of action or scheduling further protests, some even questioning his ability to lead the party and his loyalty to Saakashvili, pointing at the alleged internal power struggle within the party between Melia and Saakashvili. Melia responded to criticism by denying the existence of any conflict.

Georgia&#x27;s rights ombudsman stated that Saakashvili was not being given proper medical care and was being abused by fellow inmates. The State Inspector&#x27;s Service of Georgia launched a criminal investigation into alleged inhuman treatment of Mikheil Saakashvili. Since 1 March 2022, the Special Investigation Service of Georgia has continued investigating instead of the State Inspector&#x27;s Service.

On 8 November 2021, Saakashvili was moved to Gldani penitentiary hospital. On 19 November 2021, Saakashvili was transferred to a Gori military hospital. Saakashvili&#x27;s doctor Nokoloz Kipshidze and lawyer Nika Gvaramia stated that Saakashvili would end the 50-day hunger strike.

On 12 December 2021, Otar Toidze, a doctor with Georgia&#x27;s human rights commissioner said Saakashvili was in need of specialist treatment abroad. On 29 December 2021, he was taken from hospital to prison of Rustavi, according to oppositional leaders and media his health conditions were still bad, and he was still continuing decreasing weight, according to his lawyer Nika Gvaramia.

On 12 May 2022, Saakashvili was transferred to a civilian hospital in Tbilisi.

On 1 December 2022, Saakashvili&#x27;s lawyers appealed the court to either postpone Saakashvili&#x27;s sentence or release him from prison on medical grounds.

On 24 January 2023, Saakashvili tested positive for COVID-19.

On 1 February, Saakashvili testified before the court remotely. He appeared to have lost a lot of weight, as evidenced by protruding ribs and stomach. According to his lawyer, Saakashvili, who is 195 cm in height, weighs only 69.7 kilograms, has lost 52 kilograms since 1 October 2021, and cannot move without a wheelchair. Despite this, the Court did not deem this sufficient and did not satisfy the motion of the defence in the case on the postponement of Saakashvili&#x27;s sentence or his release. In March 2023, Poland suggested sending doctors to Georgia to examine Saakashvili amid concerns about his health.

While imprisoned, Saakashvili has remained politically active. In August 2023, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published an extensive opinion piece by Saakashvili, in which he reflected on his decision to return to Georgia and the challenges he had faced in prison, writing:There was a time a year ago, as my health was declining dramatically and death felt imminent, when I regretted coming back to Georgia. I thought to myself that if I survived this ordeal, if I tasted freedom again, I would leave Georgian politics behind for good. I felt my sacrifice had been a miscalculation, a folly.

But even when I tried to turn my back on Georgian politics, Georgian politics kept returning to me. I have come to recognize that even as a prisoner with limited contact with the outside, I have a crucial role to play in Georgia&#x27;s future, a role I cannot just walk away from.

===Coup plot accusation===
On 18 September 2023, the State Security Service of Georgia (SSG) accused Saakashvili and his followers of plotting with the Ukrainian government and Georgian Legion (a group of mostly ethnic Georgian volunteers fighting on behalf of Ukraine) of planning a coup d&#x27;état against the Georgian government. The SSG claimed that anti-government protests were being planned by Ukrainian intelligence for October and December 2023. The Russian government filed eight criminal cases against Georgian Legion&#x27;s commander Mamuka Mamulashvili and placed a bounty to capture him. Mamulashvili stated that the claims of a coup were baseless, and that they were evidence that Georgian Dream is a Russophilic party.

===International reaction to Saakashvili&#x27;s arrest===

Saakashvili&#x27;s arrest led to major criticism from the Ukrainian government, European Parliament, U.S. State Department and international organizations.

International criticism was focused on alleged violation of Saakashvili&#x27;s human rights in prison, as well as on allegedly politically motivated legal proceedings against him. On 1 October 2021, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also stated he would work to ensure Saakashvili&#x27;s release, as Saakashvili is a Ukrainian citizen who was stripped of his Georgian citizenship in 2015. This was criticized by Georgian authorities. Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili said that Saakashvili would leave Georgia only after serving his time in prison.

On 9 November, after Saakashvili was transferred to Gldani prison hospital, Amnesty International uploaded statement on Twitter, about Saakashvili: &quot;#Georgia: ex-President #Saakashvili (5th week of hunger strike) violently transferred to prison hospital; allegedly threatened; denied dignity, privacy &amp; adequate healthcare. Not just selective justice but apparent political revenge.&quot;

On 18 November 2021, the U.S. State Department urged the Government of Georgia to treat Saakashvili fairly and guarantee his right to a fair trial, and also praised the independent medical team that criticized the prison conditions.

On 28 June 2022, Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has published declaration, in which they have said that Mikheil Saakashvili has to be treated immediately in a special institution abroad.

On 14 December 2022, the European Parliament passed a resolution which urged the Georgian government to release Saakashvili on medical grounds to be treated abroad, while threatening to sanction Bidzina Ivanishvili, a founder of Georgian Dream party, for his role in &quot;deteriorating the democratic political process in Georgia&quot; .

On 14 February 2023, the European Parliament adopted a third non-binding resolution, accusing the Georgian government and Bidzina Ivanishvili of mistreating Mikheil Saakashvili in prison, once again calling for his release from prison and personal sanctions on Ivanishvili.

On 4 December 2022, Moldovan President Maia Sandu stated that she is “deeply concerned” about imprisoned ex-President Mikheil Saakashvili&#x27;s &quot;rapidly deteriorating state of health.&quot;

President Sandu also emphasized, &quot;every human life is priceless and the gravity of the situation requires immediate transfer of Saakashvili to an appropriate hospital to save his life.&quot;

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko also expressed his concerns about Saakashvili&#x27;s health.

Following Saakashvili&#x27;s hearing in the court in February 2023, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused the Georgian government of &quot;publicly torturing&quot; Ukrainian citizen Saakashvili and he claimed that &quot;Russia is killing Ukrainian citizen Mikheil Saakashvili with the hands of the Georgian authorities.&quot; According to Zelenskyy, Ukraine had &quot;repeatedly called on official Tbilisi to stop this mockery and agree on the return of Saakashvili to Ukraine.&quot;

President Zelensky has instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to summon the Georgian Ambassador to Ukraine, expressing a strong protest and requesting his departure within 48 hours for consultations with his capital in Tbilisi about transferring Saakashvili in Ukraine. Zelensky has uploaded statement on Twitter: 

On 12 July 2023 Former US Ambassadors to Georgia issued a statement urging the Government of Georgia to allow “imprisoned and emaciated former president Mikheil Saakashvili to obtain life-saving medical treatment”.

With their letter, the Ambassadors William Harrison Courtney (1995-1997), Kenneth Spencer Yalowitz (1998-2001), Richard Monroe Miles (2002-2005), John F. Tefft (2005-2009), and Ian C. Kelly (2015-2018), joined the international concerns which have escalated following the frail and decimated appearance of former President Mikheil Saakashvili during a remote court hearing.

On 14 July 2023, 44 Members of European Parliament has written a letter addressed to President Zurabishvili, Parliamentary Speaker Papuashvili, and Prime Minister Garibashvili urging to transfer former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili to one of the European Union member states. The MEPs stressed the need for Saakashvili to receive the necessary and appropriate medical care.

====Reaction of Georgian government====

Criticism led to heavy squabbles between Georgian government and Ukrainian and European leadership, as well as Western and international organizations. Georgian officials argued that legal proceedings against Saakashvili met all necessary legal standards and accused Saakashvili of using &quot;international lobbysts&quot; to pressure the government to release him. They have based their claims on documents published on U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Unit website, which contained information about Saakashvili&#x27;s and his family members&#x27; spendings on lobbyists in the US, which were tasked with working on convincing U.S. congressmen and senators to impose sanctions against Georgia.

In response to criticism about Saakashvili&#x27;s deteriorating health, Georgian officials claimed Saakashvili was trying to evade prison through self-harm. In particular, Georgian Justice Minister Rati Bregadze said that Saakashvili is trying to evade prison through self-harm. He stated that there is no relevant evidence of Saakashvili being tortured and noted that the state &quot;can not be held responsible for self-harm by the inmate, including his refusal to follow medical prescriptions&quot;. Georgian officials claimed that this was part of a plan to pressure the government to release Saakashvili.

Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili accused Ukraine of sending Saakashvili from Ukraine to overthrow the Georgian government. However, according to Garibashvili, Saakashvili was arrested and the Ukrainian Government asked Tbilisi to release Saakashvili to Kyiv. Georgian Prime Minister claimed at a speech in parliament that the Ukrainian Government and the Georgian opposition are close ideological partners.

In response to criticism from the European Parliament, Georgia&#x27;s Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili said that Saakashvili is &quot;agent of the European Parliament&quot;. &quot;The European Parliament has explicitly recognised with its shameful resolution that Saakashvili is their agent and they are doing everything to save their agent and get him out of prison. This is not going to happen. We told them and many of our international partners that Saakashvili committed many serious crimes and now the illegal border crossing has been added&quot;, said Garibashvili.

The Georgian officials justified their positions based on the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). In 2011, the ECHR ruled on the &quot;ENUKIDZE AND GIRGVLIANI v. GEORGIA&quot; case, a high-profile murder case of head of the United Georgian Bank&#x27;s Foreign Department Sandro Girgvliani, for which Saakashvili was convicted, saying that the state violated Girgvliani&#x27;s right to life and that the government, the courts and the parliament coordinated to obstruct justice and free the criminals of their liability. In 2023, Saakashvili filed a case in the ECHR, stating that his rights had been violated in prison and calling the Court to order his transferal to a hospital in Warsaw in Poland. The Court rejected Saakashvili&#x27;s request. In response, Georgian officials praised the Court. The ruling party chairman Irakli Kobakhidze said that the European Court remained a bastion of justice, unlike the European Parliament, which he described as having become trapped in corruption.

==Controversies==
===Ordering beating of Valery Gelashvili===

On 14 July 2005, businessman and Republican member of parliament Valery Gelashvili was beaten by unknown people. Gelashvili suffered skull trauma, numerous fractures of facial bones, lacerations in the nose and forehead, and fractures of the bones of the upper and lower jaw. The incident occurred after daily newspaper &quot;Rezonansi&quot; published an interview with Gelashvili, in which he talked about a conflict between him and Saakashvili over the former&#x27;s house and made comments about Saakashvili&#x27;s personal life. In 2004, Gelashvili was requested by authorities to hand over his apartment building to the state after the government decided to transform the nearby Road Traffic Police building into the new presidential residence. Gelashvili agreed but requested the construction works of the new presidential residence to be carried out by his construction firm Evra. Gelashvili alleged in the interview that the government had not paid the firm for construction. He later blamed authorities and Saakashvili for ordering his attack. When the new government came into power in 2012, they promised to start investigation. On 28 June 2018, Tbilisi City Court sentenced former President Mikheil Saakashvili to six years in prison in absentia for, among other crimes, ordering the attack on Valeri Gelashvili in 2005. Saakashvili was also banned from taking any state post for two years and three months.

===Violent dispersal of 2007 protests===

Saakashvili received widespread criticism for his handling of the 2007 Georgian demonstrations, which were violently dispersed by the police using heavy-handed tactics. Saakashvili came under criticism for using rubber bullets and tear gas against protesters who were blocking Tbilisi&#x27;s main transport artery, Rustaveli Avenue.

===Allegations of corruption===

Saakashvili has been accused of corruption and amassing wealth after coming into power by his political opponents. Although petty corruption in Georgia has been largely eliminated by the Saakashvili administration, it was alleged that elite corruption remained a significant problem. Alleged corruption in Saakashvili&#x27;s inner circle was one of the main causes of 2007 Georgian demonstrations. Former Georgian Minister of Defense Irakli Okruashvili after his resignation accused Saakashvili of corruption and lobbying the interests of his own family. Okruashvili claimed that he caught the president&#x27;s uncle with a $200,000 bribe but had to hush up the scandal at the president&#x27;s request. It was alleged that Saakashvili&#x27;s family members have acquired large number of state property by president&#x27;s orders, and as a result, Saakashvili&#x27;s family has emerged as one of the richest families in Georgia by the end of his second term. According to allegations, Saakashvili&#x27;s family has taken over much of the higher education sector (his mother owning shares in several universities in Tbilisi), the spa industry and the advertisement sector. The opposition also accused then president Saakashvili of overseeing a system of elite corruption encompassing oil and minerals. Saakashvili denied accusations of his political opponents, claiming that his administration has been one of the most successful in eliminating corruption. He accused his opponents of spreading lies and not being honest. After leaving presidential post, Saakashvili has been charged by Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Georgia with illegal seizure of property and embezzlement of state funds. He and his supporters have denounced charges as politically motivated.

==Personal life==

Saakashvili is married to Dutch linguist Sandra Roelofs, whom he met in Strasbourg in 1993. The couple have two sons, Eduard and Nikoloz. A few days before Saakashvili&#x27;s October 2021 return to Georgia he recorded a video on Facebook with Ukrainian MP Yelyzaveta Yasko in which they disclosed they were having a romantic relationship. A few days later Yasko remarked that Sandra Roelofs was Saakashvili&#x27;s &quot;ex-wife&quot;. There had been no media reports that Saakashvili and his spouse Roelofs had divorced. Roelofs had been &quot;caught by surprise&quot; by Yasko&#x27;s and Saakashvili&#x27;s video announcement and remarked on Facebook (on 7 October 2021) that &quot;its form was absolutely unacceptable.&quot; On 31 December 2021, Saakashvili recognized to have an extramarital daughter, Elis-Maria, with singer Sofia Nizharadze calling her &quot;my most lovely girl and youngest child&quot;. On 1 June 2023 Yasko revealed that she and Saakashvili had become parents, the gender and birthdate of the baby were not announced. At the time of birth Saakashvili was imprisoned.

Apart from his native Georgian, Saakashvili speaks fluent English, French, Russian and Ukrainian, and has some command of Ossetian and Spanish.

Some non-Georgian sources spell Saakashvili&#x27;s first name using the Russian spelling, &quot;Mikhail&quot;. In Georgia, he is commonly known as &quot;Misha&quot;, a hypocorism for Mikheil.

Saakashvili enjoys exercise and has in the past often been seen in public on his bicycle.

==Appraisal==
In the 2010 study &quot;Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes After the Cold War&quot;, political scientists Steven Levitsky and Lucan A. Way cite various media and human rights reports to describe Saakashvili&#x27;s Georgia as a &quot;competitive authoritarian&quot; (i.e., a formally democratic but essentially non-democratic) state.

Saakashvili&#x27;s government has been lauded by the World Bank for making &quot;striking improvements&quot; in the fight against corruption. In addition, the US State Department noted that in 2005 &quot;the government amended several laws and increased the amount of investigations and prosecutions reducing the amount of abuse and ill-treatment in pre-trial detention facilities&quot;. The status of religious freedom also improved due to increased investigation and prosecution of those harassing followers of non-traditional faiths.

The scrupulousness of Patarkatsishvili&#x27;s political opposition toward the Georgian president has been questioned by the Jamestown Foundation&#x27;s political analyst Vladimir Socor who attributed the businessman&#x27;s discontent to Saakashvili&#x27;s anti-corruption reforms, which &quot;had severely curtailed Patarkatsishvili&#x27;s scope for doing business in his accustomed, post-Soviet 1990s-style ways.&quot; Patarkatsishvili—who had fled the Russian authorities after allegations of fraud—was called &quot;a state criminal&quot; by Saakashvili, who accused him of treason while refusing to admit to any of his accusations.

Saakashvili was portrayed by Cuban-American Hollywood actor Andy García in the 2010 Hollywood film &quot;5 Days of War&quot; by Finnish-American film director Renny Harlin. The film tells the story of Saakashvili and the events during the Russo-Georgian War.

<text>Edwin Forrest (March 9, 1806December 12, 1872) was a nineteenth-century American Shakespearean actor. His feud with the British actor William Macready was the cause of the deadly Astor Place Riot of 1849.

==Early life==
Forrest was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Rebecca (&quot;née&quot; Lauman) and William Forrest. His father, a Scottish merchandise peddler, moved from Dumfriesshire to Trenton, New Jersey in 1791. His mother was a member of an affluent German-American family. A business setback led William to relocate to Philadelphia, where he married Rebecca and was able to secure a position with a local branch of the United States Bank. As boys, Forrest and his brother William joined a local juvenile thespian club and participated in theatrical performances staged in a sparsely decorated woodshed.

At the age of 11, Forrest made his first appearance on the legitimate stage at Philadelphia&#x27;s South Street Theatre, playing the female role Rosalia de Borgia in the John D. Turnbull melodrama &quot;Rudolph: or, The Robbers of Calabria&quot;. After Forrest&#x27;s father died in 1819, he attempted to apprentice with a printer, a cooper, and finally a ship chandler. When attending a lecture in early 1820, he volunteered to participate in an experiment on the effects of nitrous oxide. While under the influence of the gas, he broke into a soliloquy from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; that impressed eminent Philadelphia lawyer John Swift so much that Swift arranged an audition at the Walnut Street Theatre; this led to Forrest&#x27;s formal stage debut on November 27, 1820, as Young Norval in John Home&#x27;s &quot;Douglas&quot;.

==Early acting career==
The theatres of New York and Philadelphia were already crowded with trained and successful actors, mostly the offspring of well-known British theatrical families or at least with British training. Few American actors were able to make much headway in these theaters, whose managers were highly skeptical of the quality of local talent.

Forrest therefore accepted an offer from Joshua Collins and William Jones, who owned theatres in Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Lexington, and were scouting Philadelphia for actors who were willing to face the rigors of performing in the new cities along the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. His tour through a rough country—with the inconveniences of long distances, the necessity of presenting his plays in rude halls, insufficient support, and poor scenery—was not altogether successful, but the discipline to mind and body was felt in all his subsequent career. 

In 1824 he travelled from Louisville down to New Orleans, where he had been invited to join the company of the American Theatre, under the management of William Caldwell. There he began to act in a higher quality of production - though usually in roles secondary to Caldwell - and began to attract favorable responses from New Orleans audiences. However, Forrest vied with his employer for the affections of the leading actress of the company, Jane Placide. In a fury of jealousy, he quit the company and spent two months living in the Louisiana wilderness. Later Forrest would claim he spent much of this time in the company of a Choctaw Indian chief named Push-ma-ta-ha, though recent scholarship has come to question much of his account. By 1825 he was back in Philadelphia, and then went north to act with the Pearl Street Theatre in Albany, New York, where he was able to act with, and learn from, such eminent actors as William Conway and Edmund Kean.

==New York success==
In 1826, he had a great success at the Bowery Theatre in New York City as Othello. The management employed him at a salary far below his worth, and he was at once offered increased payment at another theatre; but he refused to break his word, and carried out the contract to his own detriment. This strict sense of honor was characteristic of him throughout his career.

His New York success was repeated in every city he visited. British writer Thomas Hamilton marveled at, and dissented from, the acclaim that Forrest enjoyed at that time:He is a coarse and vulgar actor, without grace, without dignity, with little flexibility of feature, and utterly common-place in his conceptions of character. There is certainly some energy about him, but this is sadly given to degenerate into rant. The audience, however, were enraptured. Every increase of voice in the actor was followed by louder thunders from box, pit, and gallery, till it sometimes became matter of serious calculation, how much longer one&#x27;s tympanum could stand the crash.In 1829 Forrest was featured as Metamora in the play &quot;Metamora; or, The Last of the Wampanoags&quot; by John Augustus Stone. After a few years of profitable labor, during which he had encouraged native talent by liberal offers for new American plays, he went to Europe for rest and travel and larger observation, and was received with much courtesy by actors and scholars.

He returned to Philadelphia in 1831, and played there and in New York and elsewhere with triumphant success until September 1836, when he sailed for England, this time professionally, and made his first appearance at Drury Lane as Spartacus in &quot;The Gladiator&quot; in 1836. The play was not a success, although his own role was noted favorably. During a season of ten months he performed in that historic theatre the parts of Macbeth, Othello, and King Lear. His social triumphs were as great as were his professional; he was entertained by William Macready and Charles Kemble, and at the end of the season was complimented by a dinner at the Garrick Club, presided over by Thomas Talfourd.

During this engagement he married, in June 1837, Miss Catherine Norton Sinclair, daughter of John Sinclair, a popular English singer. He returned to Philadelphia in November of the same year and began an engagement. His wife made a deep impression wherever she was presented, and it was argued that domestic happiness would be the fitting crown of his public career. But these predictions were disappointed.

==Playwriting contest==

Edwin Forrest began a playwriting contest from 1828 to 1847. The only rule the plays had to follow was that the lead Character had to fit Forrest and the plays typically followed American themes. The first play to win the contest was &quot;Metamora&quot; by John Augustus Stone in 1828. The winner the following year was &quot;The Gladiator&quot; by Robert Montgomery Bird. Other winning titles include Richard Penn Smith&#x27;s &quot;Caius Marcus&quot;; two other plays by Robert Montgomery Bird: &quot;Oralloosa&quot; and &quot;The Broker of Bogota&quot;; and Robert T. Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Jack Cade&quot;. Forrest was now known as a great Shakespearean actor as well as a supporter of emerging American playwrights. However, though his contest did raise the general reputation of American playwrights, it did little to help get the winners&#x27; plays produced elsewhere. &quot;Metamora&quot;, &quot;The Gladiator&quot;, and &quot;Jack Cade&quot; so well suited Forrest&#x27;s strengths as a performer, showing off his strong voice and well-developed physique, that they remained in Forrest&#x27;s personal repertory for the rest of his career.

==Rivalry with Macready==
Forrest visited London a second time in 1845, accompanied by his wife, who was welcomed in the intellectual circles of English and Scottish society. He acted at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre in London. He met with great success in Virginius and other parts, but when he attempted to personate Macbeth, a character unsuited to his physique and style of acting, the performance was hissed by the audience. Forrest attributed the hissing to the professional jealousy and machinations of Macready, although that artist had been kind and helpful to him when he first came before London audiences.

A few weeks later, when Macready was playing Hamlet in Edinburgh, Forrest stood up in a private box and hissed the English actor. This act evoked reproaches from the British press and destroyed the respect in which he had been held by the public. A letter by Forrest printed in &quot;The Times&quot; aggravated the offence. The incident was fatal to his popularity in Britain. His jealousy of Macready resulted in the Astor Place riot in May 1849. The public feud had exacerbated rifts in New York City social and political life. An estimated 10,000 people filled the streets outside the theater where Macready was playing Macbeth, fighting running battles with authorities and vainly trying to set fire to the Astor Opera House. Dozens of rioters were killed, and around 250 civilians, policemen and soldiers were injured.

==Divorce==
In 1850, Forrest and his wife sought divorce, after Forrest&#x27;s affair with actress Josephine Clifton; he claimed that he had found a love letter to his wife from fellow actor George W. Jamieson. Forrest and Catherine separated in April 1849 and he moved to Philadelphia where he filed for divorce in February 1850, though the Pennsylvania legislature denied his divorce application. Under the advice of Parke Godwin, Catherine hired Charles O&#x27;Conor as her lawyer. The divorce became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; and the well-known writer Nathaniel Parker Willis was caught in the middle. Willis defended Catherine, who maintained her innocence, in his magazine &quot;Home Journal&quot; and suggested that Forrest was merely jealous of her intellectual superiority. On June 17, 1850, shortly after Forrest had filed for divorce in the New York Supreme Court, Forrest beat Willis with a gutta-percha whip in New York&#x27;s Washington Square, shouting &quot;this man is the seducer of my wife&quot;. Willis, who was recovering from a rheumatic fever at the time, was unable to fight back. Willis&#x27;s own wife soon received an anonymous letter suggesting that Willis was, in fact, involved with Forrest&#x27;s wife. Willis later sued Forrest for assault and, by March 1852, was awarded $2,500 plus court costs. In the divorce case, Charles O&#x27;Conor was the counsel for Catherine, the defendant, with John Van Buren representing Edwin. Throughout the Forrest divorce case, which lasted six weeks, several witnesses made additional claims that Catherine Forrest and Nathaniel Parker Willis were having an affair, including a waiter who claimed he had seen the couple &quot;lying on each other&quot;. As the press reported, &quot;thousands and thousands of the anxious public&quot; awaited the court&#x27;s verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis&#x27;s name was cleared. O&#x27;Conor won a national reputation by winning the case, and secured a liberal alimony for Catherine. The whole affair hurt Forrest&#x27;s reputation and soured his temper.

==Later stage career==

In 1853, he played Macbeth, with a strong cast and fine scenery, at the Broadway Theatre for four weeks—an unprecedented run at that date. He became interested in politics, being spoken of as a candidate for congress. In 1860, he appeared at Niblo&#x27;s Garden, New York, as Hamlet, and played the most successful engagement of his life. Some news reports at that time said he had been retired from acting for several years, although there are also numerous newspapers accounts of his performances in different cities between 1853 and 1860. Hereditary gout developed itself in a malignant form in 1865, during an engagement at the Holliday Street Theatre in Baltimore, Maryland the sciatic nerve was paralyzed, and he never regained the use of his hand or his steady gait. His California tour in 1866 was a failure. He played his last New York engagement in February 1871, the plays being &quot;Richelieu&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;. The weather was cold, and the houses empty.

In October 1871, Forrest commenced his last annual tour, starting at the Walnut Theater in his home town of Philadelphia. He passed through Columbus, OH; Cincinnati, OH; New Orleans, LA; Galveston, TX; Nashville, TN; Kansas City, MO; Leavenworth, KS; St. Louis, MO; Pittsburgh, PA; Detroit, MI; Buffalo, NY; and by late February the Opera House in Rochester, NY; February 27 through March 1. From Rochester he traveled on to Boston, MA.

On the night of March 25, 1872, he appeared in Boston, Massachusetts at the Globe Theatre, as Lear, played this part six times, and was announced for Richelieu and Virginius, but on the intervening Sunday he caught cold. He struggled through the role of Richelieu on Monday night, and rare bursts of eloquence lighted the gloom, but he labored piteously against the disease which was fast conquering him. Being offered stimulants, he signed them away, with the words, &quot;If I die, I will still be my royal self.&quot; This was his last appearance as an actor. He eventually recovered from the severe attack of pneumonia. The craving for public applause, which was his only happiness, induced him to give readings from Shakespeare in several large cities. The scheme failed, and was abandoned, to his deep mortification.

A stroke of paralysis ended his life suddenly and without pain. His servant found him dead, alone, and apparently asleep, in his home in Philadelphia December 12, 1872. His body was interred in Old Saint Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church Cemetery, Philadelphia. The large sums that he had earned on the stage were judiciously and fortunately invested, and resulted in his amassing a large fortune. He had purchased, about 1850, a site on the banks of the Hudson, on which he erected a castellated structure. This estate, which he named Fonthill, he afterward sold at a large advance for a convent, which later became the College of Mount Saint Vincent. In 1855 he purchased his mansion in Philadelphia, to which he retired after his temporary abandonment of the stage. There he collected the largest dramatic library in the United States. By avoiding New York and by legal evasions he succeeded in escaping the payment of alimony to his wife, but left his estate heavily in her debt.

==Philanthropic efforts==

His love of the theatre was unbounded, and he is one of the few whose memory survives to this day, for he used his considerable accumulated wealth to support his fellow actors.

This began in 1865, the year of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination by the actor John Wilkes Booth, a time when the public held those in the acting profession in low regard, if not contempt. He sheltered actors at his Summer home near Philadelphia and, in 1876, four years after his death at the age of 66, his will instructed that there should be formed the Forrest Home for retired actors in Philadelphia, which was to last for over one hundred years before being folded into the much larger Actors Fund facility in Englewood, New Jersey. There his name lives on, in the Edwin Forrest Wing. His will also instructed that a two thousand dollars bequest be provided to Actors&#x27; Order of Friendship, whose New York City Lodge was named after him.

In the 1920s, architect Herbert J. Krapp was chosen to design two new theatres, one in New York City and the other in Philadelphia. Both were initially named the Forrest Theatre in honor of Forrest and his contributions to the theatre world. While the Philadelphia location is still called the Forrest Theatre, the building in New York has changed names over the years and is currently known as the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre.

<text>The Flex Computer System was developed by Michael Foster and Ian Currie of Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) in Malvern, England, during the late 1970s and 1980s. It used a tagged storage scheme to implement a capability architecture, and was designed for the safe and efficient implementation of strongly typed procedures.

The hardware was custom and microprogrammable, with an operating system, (modular) compiler, editor, garbage collector and filing system all written in ALGOL 68RS. 

There were (at least) two incarnations of Flex, implemented using hardware with writable microcode. The first was supplied by Logica to an RSRE design, and the second used an ICL PERQ. The microcode alone was responsible for storage allocation, deallocation and garbage collection. This immediately precluded a whole class of errors arising from the misuse (deliberate or accidental) of pointers.

A notable feature of Flex was the tagged, write-once filestore. This allowed arbitrary code and data structures to be written and retrieved transparently, without recourse to external encodings. Data could thus be passed safely from program to program.

In a similar way, remote capabilities allowed data and procedures on other machines to be accessed over a network connection, again without the application program being involved in external encodings of data, parameters or result values.

The whole scheme allowed abstract data types to be safely implemented, as data items and the procedures permitted to access them could be bound together, and the resulting capability passed freely around. The capability would grant access to the procedures, but could not be used in any way to obtain access to the data.

Another notable feature of Flex was the notion of shaky pointers, more recently often called weak references, which points to blocks of memory that could be freed at the next garbage collection. This is used for example for cached disc blocks or a list of spare procedure work-spaces.

COMFLEX, a packet switching network capable of transmitting data at magnetic-disc speed, was developed alongside Flex. It made feasible the use of remote file-stores, remote capabilities, and remote procedure calls.

<doc id="376749" wikidata="Q7049063" url="?curid=376749" title="Nontraditional student">
<text>Nontraditional student is a term that refers to a category of students at colleges and universities. The term originated in North America and usually involves age and social characteristics. Nontraditional students are contrasted with traditional students.

The United States Department of Education estimated that 73% of all undergraduates in the United States attending accredited institutions in 1999–2000 had one or more nontraditional characteristics. This remained consistent in the following years: 72% in 2003–2004, 72% for 2007–2008, and 74% for 2011–2012.

==Definition and history==
It is uncertain exactly how or when the term “nontraditional student” was first incorporated into educational language. However, it is thought that K. Patricia Cross is responsible for the phrase becoming the accepted and appropriate term to describe adult students. In the United States, gender was a defining characteristic of nontraditional students, with women (particularly older women) being viewed as unusual; but gender is no longer a defining characteristic of nontraditional students in the United States due to women making up most of the college population and the decline of male students.

Scholars disagree on the exact definition of nontraditional. Modern defining characteristics usually include social traits and age. Most studies agree that undergraduates age 25 or older are classified as nontraditional. Most studies also agree that part-time students are nontraditional, but there is disagreement in literature. 

According to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) other defining characteristics of nontraditional students are:
*Delays enrollment (does not enter postsecondary education in the same calendar year that high school ended)
*Works full-time (35 hours or more per week) while enrolled
*Is considered financially independent for purposes of determining eligibility for financial aid
*Has dependents other than a spouse (usually children, but may also be caregivers of sick or elderly family members)
*Does not have a high school diploma (completed high school with a GED or other high school completion certificate or did not finish high school)

==Demographics==
Regarding the 2011-2012 demographics distribution of nontraditional undergraduate students in the United States, the following were identified by the National Center for Education Statistics:
* 49% dependent and 51% independent
* 28% has dependent(s) and 72% has no dependent
* 15% single with dependent and 85% single with no dependent
* 91% high school graduate and 9% high school equivalency
* 66% delayed postsecondary enrollment less than one year and 34% delayed postsecondary enrollment one year or more
* 57% fulltime student and 43% part-time student
* 26% worked full time, 36% worked part time, and 38% did not work.

In 1999–2000, the most common nontraditional characteristics included financial independence (51 percent), part-time attendance (48 percent), and delayed enrollment (46 percent).

The NCES divides tertiary educational institutions into three categories: public, private-non-profit, and private-for-profit (PFP). With regard to the age demographic of students enrolled in these institutions, the NCES uses three age categories: under 25, between 25 and 34, and 35 and older. According to its most recent publication, in a section called &quot;The Condition of Education 2013,&quot;&quot;most nontraditional students are enrolled in PFP’s. In fact, for the fall enrollment in 2011, in four-year PFP institutions 71% full-time and 78% part-time students were at least 25 years old or older. In two-year PFP institutions, 52% full-time and 61% part-time students were also included in this &#x27;nontraditional&#x27; category.&quot;

==Special characteristics==
Nontraditional students frequently have different characteristics than traditional students, experience different barriers, and have different instructional and campus support needs than traditional students.

While many institutions offer programs for nontraditional students and services in response to their specific needs, it is frequently observed that traditional higher education programs and policies are geared toward, and the outcome of, the previous era when traditional students were the main market for higher education. Institutional barriers most frequently identified in research include difficulty obtaining financial support, negative attitudes toward adult learners, a general lack of resources at times and places suitable to adult learners, and recognition of prior learning and academic credentials. The nontraditional student designation has also to a lesser extent been used to refer to socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged students. 

Situational barriers most frequently experienced by adult nontraditional students typically include managing multiple conflicting responsibilities in addition to their studies (e.g., life and work responsibilities and roles), financial problems and limited financial aid options for nontraditional students, lack of adequate and affordable childcare services, and lack of support from others.

Attitudinal barriers most frequently identified in research include low self-esteem and negative attitudes about being an adult learner.

Barriers related to academic skills most frequently discussed in the literature include a lack of knowledge and experience in literacy, numeracy, and computer-related skills, accessing and understanding information, critical and reflective thinking, essay writing, and writing examinations and tests.

An Australian study conducted in 2017 sampled 442 (316 female, 126 male) first year undergraduate psychology students at a major publicly funded university. Data was drawn from an online mental health survey to measure &quot;student resilience&quot;. Resilience can be defined as the ‘personal qualities that enable one to thrive in the face of adversity’ (Connor and Davidson, 2003: 76). The Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10; Campbell-Sills and Stein, 2007) was adopted as a measure of resilience. Out of the total 442 respondents, 25.6% identified themselves as ‘non-traditional’ students (n = 113). Those who identified themselves as ‘non-traditional’ were significantly different from those who considered themselves as ‘traditional’ on a number of demographic measures. They were more likely to be male, older, hold a previous degree, study part-time, be an international student, speak a language other than English, have longer gap year, have more children, be reliant on government financial aid, work longer hours and admit to university via methods alternative to the standard pathway (i.e. Australian Tertiary Admission Rank). The most common reason that students used to identify themselves as ‘non-traditional’ was age (58.4%, n = 66). Other reasons included cultural background (43.4%, n = 50), admission pathway (42.5%, n = 48), geographical origin (30.1%, n = 34), being employed (25.7%, n = 29), household income (20.4%, n = 23), being a parent (18.6%, n = 21) and mode of study (14.2%, n = 16). Seventeen students nominated other reasons (15.9%, n = 17), including richer life experience and reason for study (e.g. for self-improvement rather than occupational reasons). The major finding from this study is that those who perceived themselves to be ‘non-traditional’, particularly in terms of age, roles as a parent and role as an employee, have reported higher resilience.

<doc id="376751" wikidata="Q545205" url="?curid=376751" title="Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic">
<text>The Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic (Transcaucasian SFSR or TSFSR), also known as the Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, or simply Transcaucasia, was a republic of the Soviet Union that existed from 1922 to 1936.

The TSFSR comprised Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, traditionally known as the &quot;Transcaucasian Republics&quot; as they were separated from Russia by the Caucasus Mountains. The TSFSR was one of the four republics to sign the Treaty on the Creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics establishing the Soviet Union in 1922. The TSFSR was created ostensibly to consolidate the economic situation and Bolshevik control over the region. The TSFSR was dissolved upon the adoption of the 1936 Soviet Constitution and its constituent republics were elevated individually to republics of the Soviet Union.

== History ==
The roots of a Transcaucasian condominium state trace back to the dissolution of the Russian Empire in 1918, following the October Revolution, when the provinces of the Caucasus seceded and formed their own state called the Transcaucasian Federation. Competing ethno-national interests and confrontation with the Ottoman Empire in World War I led to the dissolution of the Transcaucasian Federation only two months later, in April 1918.

The three successor states—the First Republic of Armenia, the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, and the Democratic Republic of Georgia—lasted until the end of the Russian Civil War that was being fought across the mountains, when they were invaded by the Red Army and sovietized. Following the proposal by Vladimir Lenin the three now Soviet Republics, the Armenian, Azerbaijani and Georgian SSRs, were united into the Federative Union of Socialist Soviet Republics of Transcaucasia on 12 March 1922. On 13 December that year, the First All-Caucasian Congress of Soviets transformed this &quot;federation of states&quot; into a unified &quot;federal state&quot; and renamed it into the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, though keeping formally the autonomy of its constituent republics. The congress also adopted the constitution, appointed the Central Executive Committee (the highest legislative body between congressional sessions), and the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (the government). Mamia Orakhelashvili, a Georgian Bolshevik leader, became the first chairman of the Transcaucasian SFSR&#x27;s Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. Tbilisi was the capital of the republic.

The republic became a founding member of the Soviet Union on 30 December along with the Russian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR, and the Byelorussian SSR. In December 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved and divided again among the Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijani SSRs.

== Autonomous republics within the TSFSR ==
After the Red Army invasion of Georgia, Abkhazia (an autonomous province within the Democratic Republic of Georgia) was declared a Soviet Republic. In March 1922, the Abkhaz Revolutionary committee renamed the region the SSR of Abkhazia. Despite the declaration of this new Soviet Republic, its relations with Georgia and Russia had yet to be formally settled. On December 16, 1921, Abkhazia signed a treaty of alliance with the Georgian SSR codifying its status as a &quot;treaty republic&quot; (Russian: договорная республика). This agreement allowed the formation of an Abkhazia military while also establishing a political and financial union between the two Soviet republics. Thus, through Georgia, Abkhazia joined the TSFSR and was initially on an equal footing with the other republics of the federation. On February 19, 1931, Abkhazia&#x27;s republican status was downgraded to that of an Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within the Georgian SSR.

The Adjar ASSR was established on July 16, 1921, within the Georgian SSR as a consequence of the Treaty of Kars. The treaty marking the end of the Caucasus Campaign in World War I provided for the division of the former Batum Oblast of the Kutais Governorate of the Russian Empire between Georgia and Turkey. According to the agreement the northern half with significant Georgian Muslim population would become part of the Soviet Georgia but granted autonomy.

Another autonomous republic was established in July 1920 in Nakhchivan, an area bordering Armenia, Turkey and Iran, which was claimed by Armenians and Azerbaijanis. After the occupation of the region by the Red Army, the Nakhchivan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was declared with &quot;close ties&quot; to the Azerbaijani SSR. The Treaty of Moscow and the Treaty of Kars established the Nakhchivan region as an autonomous republic under the protection of the Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.

== Heads of state ==



== Stamps and postal history ==

Before 1923, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan each issued their own postage stamps. The Transcaucasian Federation began issuing its own stamps on September 15, 1923, and superseded the separate republics&#x27; issues on October 1.

The first issues consisted of some of the stamps of Russia and Armenia overprinted with a star containing the five-letter acronym of the Federation inside the points. Massive inflation having set in, this was followed by an issue of the Federation&#x27;s own designs, four values of a view of oil fields, and four with a montage of Soviet symbols over mountains and oil derricks, values ranging from 40,000 to 500,000 Transcaucasian rubles. The 40,000 rubles and 75,000 rubles were then surcharged to 700,000 rubles. On October 24, the stamps were re-issued with values from 1 to 18 gold kopecks. Starting in 1924, the Federation used stamps of the Soviet Union.
Most of the stamps of the Federation are not especially rare today, with 1998 prices in the US$1–2 range, although the overprints on Armenian stamps range up to US$200. As might be expected from a short period of usage, used stamps are less common than unused and covers are not often seen.

<text>Lawrence Patrick Barrett (April 4, 1838 – March 20, 1891) was an American stage actor.

Barrett began his career in 1853 in Detroit and made his first New York appearance in 1856. Barrett enlisted for the American Civil War in 1862, but resigned in 1863. He later managed the California Theatre in San Francisco from 1868 to 1870 alongside John McCullough. Barrett performed a variety of roles, including Hamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth. He was especially known for his portrayal of Cardinal Richelieu in Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s drama.

Barrett acted in London on multiple occasions and produced and starred in several plays. He frequently collaborated with fellow stage actor Edwin Booth, touring together and achieving immense success. Barrett&#x27;s health began to decline in 1890, and he died in 1891 during a performance of Richelieu.

Barrett married Mary Frederika Mayer in 1859, and was the grandfather of actress Edith Barrett. His acting style was described as versatile and expressive, but some critics questioned his stage personations.

==Biography==

A native of Paterson, New Jersey, Barrett was born in 1838 to Mary Agnes (née Read) Barrett and tailor Thomas Barrett, Irish immigrants who had settled in Paterson. He was raised in Detroit, and made his first stage appearance there in 1853 as Murad in &quot;The French Spy&quot;. In December 1856 he made his first New York appearance at the Chambers Street theatre as Sir Thomas Clifford in &quot;The Hunchback&quot;.

In 1858 he was in the repertory company at the Boston Museum. In 1862 enlisted for the American Civil War, and was appointed a captain in Company B of the 28th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment; he served until resigning in 1863. From 1868 to 1870, with John McCullough, he managed the California Theatre, San Francisco, where he frequently toured the interior towns with McCullough and casts from the theater.

Among his many and varied parts may be mentioned Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, Shylock, Richard III, Wolsey, Benedick in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, Richelieu, David Garrick, &quot;Hernani&quot;, Alfred Evelyn, Lanciotto in George Henry Boker&#x27;s (1823–1890) &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;, and Janies Harebell in &quot;The Man o&#x27; Airlie&quot;.

Barrett acted in London in 1867, 1882, 1883 and 1884, his &quot;Cardinal Richelieu&quot; portrayal in Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s drama being considered his best part. In 1889, he produced the first performance of &quot;The Duchess of Padua&quot;, retitling it &quot;Guido Ferranti&quot; and taking on the title role. In 1869 Barrett partnered with actor John McCullough in the creation of San Francisco&#x27;s California Theater, leaving his management position within two years, although he became a frequent actor on tour of the West throughout the 1870s and 80s. He was particularly successful in Kansas City, Missouri, where he performed for a week in December 1870 in the inaugural season of the Coates Opera House; he returned 11 times. In 1889, he produced William Young&#x27;s play &quot;Ganelon&quot;, with himself in the title role. The expensive production set in the Middle Ages had a successful run. William S. Hart, who was initially hired to play one of the roles, recalled,&quot; The performances were given, and they were highly creditable too!&quot;

He was managed for many years by Robert E. Stevens, the father of actress Emily Stevens and theater director Robert Stevens. In addition to his acting, Barrett also wrote a life of Edwin Forrest in the American Actors Series (Boston, 1881). Of the actor, Barrett said his personality was too strong to allow his characters to show through: &quot;He was in all things marked and distinctive. His obtrusive personality often destroyed the harmony of the portrait he was painting.&quot;

Barrett frequently worked with fellow stage actor Edwin Booth; he played Othello to Booth&#x27;s Iago and Cassius to his Brutus in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. He wrote a sketch of his colleague for &quot;Edwin Booth and his Contemporaries&quot; (Boston, 1886). Shortly after, Barrett contacted Booth and suggested that the two tour together beginning in 1887 season. They worked together for the next several years and were immensely successful, both in popularity and in financial returns. As Booth reflected on Barrett&#x27;s leadership and management, he wrote: &quot;Well, why should I not do good work, after all Barrett has done for me... Good work, eh? Well, I&#x27;ll give him the best that&#x27;s in me, he deserves it.&quot;

On April 3, 1889, the two were performing in &quot;Othello&quot; but Booth&#x27;s voice did not work when he attempted to deliver Iago&#x27;s first lines. Barrett asked the curtain to be lowered and called for doctors before telling the audience there would be no performance that night. He was reported as saying, &quot;We fear that this is the beginning of the end. The world may have heard for the last time the voice of the greatest actor who speaks the English language.&quot; Newspapers reported that Booth was dying, though he survived the incident.

Barrett began showing serious health problems in 1890. That year, after organizing performances starring Booth and Polish actress Helena Modjeska, he traveled to a spa in Germany before rejoining them in the fall. Due to a glandular problem, however, his face was swollen and his voice was weak. Finally, in March 1891, during a performance of &quot;Richelieu&quot; at the Broadway Theatre, Barrett whispered to Booth that he could not go on. He finished the scene before being replaced by his understudy. He died three days later. A few years after his death, author Eugene Field criticized the condition of his grave in Massachusetts, writing: &quot;The neglect with which Barrett&#x27;s memory has been treated... is one of the most shameful blots upon the theatrical profession.&quot;

==Personal life==
Barrett married Mary F. Mayer in Boston on September 4, 1859, at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston.
He was the grandfather of stage and screen actress Edith Barrett, the first wife of Vincent Price.

Barrett was a longtime friend of Miss Matoaca Gay; he encouraged her studies of Shakespeare, and even gave readings at Miss Gay&#x27;s study groups.

Barrett was a close friend of George Armstrong Custer and hosted him whenever the cavalry officer visited New York. According to author Stephen Ambrose, Barrett nearly talked Custer into abandoning his career in the military for one as an actor. In 1872, just four years before Custer and his entire command would be wiped out by a gathering of Plains tribes at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Barrett accompanied Custer on a whirlwind buffalo hunt across the Great Plains. At one point the pair reportedly killed a number of the rapidly disappearing animals from the top of a moving train in Kansas.

==Acting style==
One critic noted Barrett had &quot;a well knit form and face capable of expressing sorrow, by the merest movement of a muscle; joy by the kindling of the eye; or rage, by the transport of the entire body&quot;. Another critic disagreed, however, writing: &quot;Mr. Barrett is generally looked upon as being a brainy man, an earnest man, an ambitious man, and a studious man. He writes well, talks well, and manages well, but in the judgment of the metropolitan connoisseurs he does not play well. His culture and cleverness appear, they say, in everything he does except in his stage personations.&quot;

<doc id="376757" wikidata="Q2346165" url="?curid=376757" title="Balanced ternary">
<text>Balanced ternary is a ternary numeral system (i.e. base 3 with three digits) that uses a balanced signed-digit representation of the integers in which the digits have the values −1, 0, and 1. This stands in contrast to the standard (unbalanced) ternary system, in which digits have values 0, 1 and 2. 
The balanced ternary system can represent all integers without using a separate minus sign; the value of the leading non-zero digit of a number has the sign of the number itself. The balanced ternary system is an example of a non-standard positional numeral system. It was used in some early computers and has also been used to solve balance puzzles.

Different sources use different glyphs to represent the three digits in balanced ternary. In this article, T (which resembles a ligature of the minus sign and 1) represents −1, while 0 and 1 represent themselves. Other conventions include using &#x27;−&#x27; and &#x27;+&#x27; to represent −1 and 1 respectively, or using Greek letter theta (Θ), which resembles a minus sign in a circle, to represent −1. In publications about the Setun computer, −1 is represented as overturned 1: &quot;1&quot;.

Balanced ternary makes an early appearance in Michael Stifel&#x27;s book &quot;Arithmetica Integra&quot; (1544). It also occurs in the works of Johannes Kepler and Léon Lalanne. Related signed-digit schemes in other bases have been discussed by John Colson, John Leslie, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and possibly even the ancient Indian Vedas.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 denote the set of symbols (also called &quot;glyphs&quot; or &quot;characters&quot;), where the symbol formula_2 is sometimes used in place of formula_3 
Define an integer-valued function formula_4 by

:formula_5
where the right hand sides are integers with their usual values. This function, formula_6 is what rigorously and formally establishes how integer values are assigned to the symbols/glyphs in formula_7 One benefit of this formalism is that the definition of &quot;the integers&quot; (however they may be defined) is not conflated with any particular system for writing/representing them; in this way, these two distinct (albeit closely related) concepts are kept separate.

The set formula_8 together with the function formula_9 forms a balanced signed-digit representation called the &quot;balanced ternary&quot; system. 
It can be used to represent integers and real numbers.

=== Ternary integer evaluation ===

Let formula_10 be the Kleene plus of formula_8, which is the set of all finite length concatenated strings formula_12 of one or more symbols (called its &quot;digits&quot;) where formula_13 is a non-negative integer and all formula_14 digits formula_15 are taken from formula_16 The &quot;start&quot; of formula_12 is the symbol formula_18 (at the right), its &quot;end&quot; is formula_19 (at the left), and its &quot;length&quot; is formula_14. The &quot;ternary evaluation&quot; is the function formula_21 defined by assigning to every string formula_22 the integer

:formula_23

The string formula_12 &quot;represents&quot; (with respect to formula_25) the integer formula_26 The value formula_27 may alternatively be denoted by formula_28 
The map formula_29 is surjective but not injective since, for example, formula_30 However, every nonzero integer has exactly one representation under formula_25 that does not &quot;end&quot; (on the left) with the symbol formula_32 i.e. formula_33

If formula_22 and formula_35 then formula_25 satisfies:

:formula_37

which shows that formula_25 satisfies a sort of recurrence relation. This recurrence relation has the initial condition
formula_39 
where formula_40 is the empty string.

This implies that for every string formula_41

:formula_42

which in words says that &quot;leading&quot; formula_43 symbols (to the left in a string with 2 or more symbols) do not affect the resulting value.

The following examples illustrate how some values of formula_25 can be computed, where (as before) all integer are written in decimal (base 10) and all elements of formula_10 are just symbols.

:formula_46

and using the above recurrence relation

:formula_47

== Conversions to/from other representations ==
=== Conversion to decimal ===

In the balanced ternary system the value of a digit &quot;n&quot; places left of the radix point is the product of the digit and 3&quot;n&quot;. This is useful when converting between decimal and balanced ternary. In the following the strings denoting balanced ternary carry the suffix, &quot;bal3&quot;. For instance,
: 10bal3 = 1 × 31 + 0 × 30 = 3dec
: 10𝖳bal3 = 1 × 32 + 0 × 31 + (−1) × 30 = 8dec
: −9dec = −1 × 32 + 0 × 31 + 0 × 30 = 𝖳00bal3
: 8dec = 1 × 32 + 0 × 31 + (−1) × 30 = 10𝖳bal3

Similarly, the first place to the right of the radix point holds 3−1 = , the second place holds 3−2 = , and so on. For instance,
: −dec = −1 + = −1 × 30 + 1 × 3−1 = 𝖳.1bal3.


An integer is divisible by three if and only if the digit in the units place is zero.

We may check the parity of a balanced ternary integer by checking the parity of the sum of all trits. This sum has the same parity as the integer itself.

Balanced ternary can also be extended to fractional numbers similar to how decimal numbers are written to the right of the radix point.

In decimal or binary, integer values and terminating fractions have multiple representations. For example, = 0.1 = 0.1 = 0.0. And, = 0.12 = 0.12 = 0.02. Some balanced ternary fractions have multiple representations too. For example, = 0.1bal3 = 0.0bal3. Certainly, in the decimal and binary, we may omit the rightmost trailing infinite 0s after the radix point and gain a representations of integer or terminating fraction. But, in balanced ternary, we can&#x27;t omit the rightmost trailing infinite −1s after the radix point in order to gain a representations of integer or terminating fraction.

Donald Knuth has pointed out that truncation and rounding are the same operation in balanced ternary—they produce exactly the same result (a property shared with other balanced numeral systems). The number is not exceptional; it has two equally valid representations, and two equally valid truncations: 0. (round to 0, and truncate to 0) and 1. (round to 1, and truncate to 1). With an odd radix, double rounding is also equivalent to directly rounding to the final precision, unlike with an even radix.

The basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—are done as in regular ternary. Multiplication by two can be done by adding a number to itself, or subtracting itself after a-trit-left-shifting.

An arithmetic shift left of a balanced ternary number is the equivalent of multiplication by a (positive, integral) power of 3; and an arithmetic shift right of a balanced ternary number is the equivalent of division by a (positive, integral) power of 3.

=== Conversion to and from a fraction===

The conversion of a repeating balanced ternary number to a fraction is analogous to converting a repeating decimal. For example (because of 111111bal3 = ()dec):
: formula_48

=== Conversion from unbalanced ternary ===
Unbalanced ternary can be converted to balanced ternary notation in two ways: 
*Add 1 trit-by-trit from the first non-zero trit with carry, and then subtract 1 trit-by-trit from the same trit without borrow. For example,
*: 0213 + 113 = 1023, 1023 − 113 = 1T1bal3 = 7dec.
*If a 2 is present in ternary, turn it into 1T. For example,
*: 02123 = 0010bal3 + 1T00bal3 + 001Tbal3 = 10TTbal3 = 23dec
If the three values of ternary logic are &quot;false&quot;, &quot;unknown&quot; and &quot;true&quot;, and these are mapped to balanced ternary as T, 0 and 1 and to conventional unsigned ternary values as 0, 1 and 2, then balanced ternary can be viewed as a biased number system analogous to the offset binary system.
If the ternary number has &quot;n&quot; trits, then the bias &quot;b&quot; is
:formula_49
which is represented as all ones in either conventional or biased form.

As a result, if these two representations are used for balanced and unsigned ternary numbers, an unsigned &quot;n&quot;-trit positive ternary value can be converted to balanced form by adding the bias &quot;b&quot; and a positive balanced number can be converted to unsigned form by subtracting the bias &quot;b&quot;. Furthermore, if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are balanced numbers, their balanced sum is when computed using conventional unsigned ternary arithmetic. Similarly, if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are conventional unsigned ternary numbers, their sum is when computed using balanced ternary arithmetic.

===Conversion from any integer base to balanced ternary===

We may convert to balanced ternary with the following formula:
:formula_50

where,
: &quot;ana&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1...&quot;a&quot;1&quot;a&quot;0.&quot;c&quot;1&quot;c&quot;2&quot;c&quot;3... is the original representation in the original numeral system. 
: &quot;b&quot; is the original radix. &quot;b&quot; is 10 if converting from decimal.
: &quot;ak&quot; and &quot;ck&quot; are the digits &quot;k&quot; places to the left and right of the radix point respectively.

For instance,
 −25.4dec = −(1T×1011 + 1TT×1010 + 11×101−1)
 = −(1T×101 + 1TT + 11÷101)
 = −10T1.
 = T01T.

 1010.12 = 1T10 + 1T1 + 1T−1
 = 10T + 1T + 0.
 = 101.

== Addition, subtraction and multiplication and division ==
The single-trit addition, subtraction, multiplication and division tables are shown below. For subtraction and division, which are not commutative, the first operand is given to the left of the table, while the second is given at the top. For instance, the answer to 1 − T = 1T is found in the bottom left corner of the subtraction table.

===Multi-trit addition and subtraction===

Multi-trit addition and subtraction is analogous to that of binary and decimal. Add and subtract trit by trit, and add the carry appropriately.
For example:

 1TT1TT.1TT1 1TT1TT.1TT1 1TT1TT.1TT1 1TT1TT.1TT1
 + 11T1.T − 11T1.T − 11T1.T → + TT1T.1

===Multi-trit multiplication===

Multi-trit multiplication is analogous to that of binary and decimal.

===Multi-trit division===
Balanced ternary division is analogous to that of binary and decimal.

However, 0.5dec = 0.1111...bal3 or 1.TTTT...bal3. If the dividend over the plus or minus half divisor, the trit of the quotient must be 1 or T. If the dividend is between the plus and minus of half the divisor, the trit of the quotient is 0. The magnitude of the dividend must be compared with that of half the divisor before setting the quotient trit. For example,

 1TT1.TT quotient

==Square roots and cube roots==
The process of extracting the square root in balanced ternary is analogous to that in decimal or binary.

As in division, we should check the value of half the divisor first. For example,

==Irrational numbers==
As in any other integer base, algebraic irrationals and transcendental numbers do not terminate or repeat. For example: 

The balanced ternary expansions of formula_53 is given in OEIS as , that of formula_54 in .
== Applications ==
=== In computer design ===

In the early days of computing, a few experimental Soviet computers were built with balanced ternary instead of binary, the most famous being the Setun, built by Nikolay Brusentsov and Sergei Sobolev. The notation has a number of computational advantages over traditional binary and ternary. Particularly, the plus–minus consistency cuts down the carry rate in multi-digit multiplication, and the rounding–truncation equivalence cuts down the carry rate in rounding on fractions. In balanced ternary, the one-digit multiplication table remains one-digit and has no carry and the addition table has only two carries out of nine entries, compared to unbalanced ternary with one and three respectively. Knuth wrote that &quot;Perhaps the symmetric properties and simple arithmetic of this number system will prove to be quite important some day,&quot; noting that,

More recently, balanced ternary numbers have been proposed for some highly-efficient low-resolution implementations of artificial neural networks. In deep learning, neural nets usually use continuous (floating-point) values, but there are many works investigating quantisation and binarisation to create neural nets that can run with much lower power and/or lower memory requirements. Balanced ternary numbers are proposed to be used for the network parameters, because they are extremely compact, but can naturally represent excitatory/inhibitory/null activation patterns.

Balanced ternary may also provide a more natural representation for the qutrit and quantum computing systems that use it.

=== Other applications ===
The theorem that every integer has a unique representation in balanced ternary was used by Leonhard Euler to justify the identity of formal power series
:formula_55

Balanced ternary has other applications besides computing. For example, a classical two-pan balance, with one weight for each power of 3, can weigh relatively heavy objects accurately with a small number of weights, by moving weights between the two pans and the table. For example, with weights for each power of 3 through 81, a 60-gram object (60dec = 1T1T0bal3) will be balanced perfectly with an 81 gram weight in the other pan, the 27 gram weight in its own pan, the 9 gram weight in the other pan, the 3 gram weight in its own pan, and the 1 gram weight set aside.

Similarly, consider a currency system with coins worth 1¤, 3¤, 9¤, 27¤, 81¤. If the buyer and the seller each have only one of each kind of coin, any transaction up to 121¤ is possible. For example, if the price is 7¤ (7dec = 1T1bal3), the buyer pays 1¤ + 9¤ and receives 3¤ in change.

<text>William Archer (23 September 185627 December 1924) was a Scottish author, theatre critic, and English spelling reformer based, for most of his career, in London. He was an early advocate of the plays of Henrik Ibsen, and a friend and advocate of George Bernard Shaw.

==Life and career==
Archer was born in Perth, the eldest boy of the nine children of Thomas Archer and his wife Grace, &quot;née&quot; Morrison. Thomas relocated frequently seeking employment, and William attended schools in Perth, Lymington, Reigate and Edinburgh. He spent parts of his boyhood with relatives in Norway where he became fluent in Norwegian and became acquainted with the literature of Henrik Ibsen.

Archer won a bursary to the University of Edinburgh to study English literature, moral and natural philosophy, and mathematics. When the family relocated to Australia in 1872, he remained in Scotland as a student. While still at the university he became a leader-writer for the &quot;Edinburgh Evening News&quot; in 1875, and after a year visiting his family in Australia, he returned to Edinburgh. In 1878, in accordance with his father&#x27;s wishes, he relocated to London to train as a barrister. He was uninterested in law, and was by now fascinated with theatre, but he entered the Middle Temple and became a barrister in 1883: he never practised. He supported himself by working as dramatic critic of &quot;The London Figaro&quot;, and after he finished his legal studies he began working for &quot;The World&quot;, which he continued from 1884 to 1906. In London he soon became known well for his work.

Archer played an important part in introducing Ibsen to the English public, starting with his translation of &quot;The Pillars of Society&quot;, produced at the Gaiety Theatre in 1880. It was the first play by Ibsen to be produced in London but was little known. He also translated, alone or in collaboration, other productions of Scandinavian drama: Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1889), &quot;The Master Builder&quot; (1893, with Edmund Gosse); Edvard Brandes&#x27;s &quot;A Visit&quot; (1892); Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1892, with Charles Archer); Georg Brandes &quot;William Shakespeare&quot;; (1895) &quot;Little Eyolf&quot; (1895); and &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot; (1897); and he edited Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Prose Dramas&quot; (1890–1891).

In 1881, Archer met Frances Elizabeth Trickett (1855–1929), the youngest of the eight children of John Trickett, a retired engineer. They married in October 1884; the next year they had their only child, Tom (1885–1918), who was killed in action in the First World War. The marriage was enduring and companionable, although Archer began a relationship in 1891, which lasted for the rest of his life, with the actress Elizabeth Robins.

In 1897, Archer, along with Robins, Henry William Massingham, and Alfred Sutro, formed the Provisional Committee to organise an association to produce plays they considered to be of high literary merit, such as Ibsen&#x27;s. The association was named the &quot;New Century Theatre&quot; but was a disappointment by 1899, although it continued until at least 1904. In 1899, a more successful association, named the Stage Society, was formed to replace it.

Archer was an early friend of George Bernard Shaw, and arranged for his plays to be translated into German. An attempted collaboration on a play failed, although Shaw later used their joint ideas for his early work, &quot;Widower&#x27;s Houses&quot;. By Archer&#x27;s influence Shaw obtained the post of art critic to the periodical &quot;The World&quot;, before becoming its music critic. A biographer, J. P. Wearing, says of their relationship:
During the First World War, Archer worked for the official War Propaganda Bureau. After the war, he achieved financial success with his play &quot;The Green Goddess&quot;, produced by Winthrop Ames at the Booth Theatre in New York City in 1921. It was a melodrama, and a popular success, although, he admitted, of much less importance for the art of the drama than his critical work.

Archer died in a London nursing home in 1924 of post-operative complications after the removal of a kidney tumour. Reviewing his life and career, Wearing&#x27;s summary is that Archer was &quot;a clear, logical man whom some saw as too narrowly rationalistic&quot;, but who was perceptive, intuitive and imaginative. Wearing attributes Archer&#x27;s great influence as a critic to these qualities and to the length of time for which he was engaged in the theatre and reviewing, although
Archer and Walter Ripman compiled the first dictionary for the English spelling reform system &quot;Nue Spelling&quot;, which would assist the development of SoundSpel.

<doc id="376760" wikidata="Q1368626" url="?curid=376760" title="Tōllān">
<text>Tollan, Tolan, or Tolán is a name used for the capital cities of two empires of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica; first for Teotihuacan, and later for the Toltec capital, Tula, both in Mexico. The name has also been applied to the Postclassic Mexican settlement Cholula.

&quot;Tollan&quot; is a word in Nahuatl used in Spanish colonial documents. Traditionally, &quot;tollan&quot; was interpreted as a Nahuatl toponym for Tula, Hidalgo, Mexico. More recent scholarship suggests some kind of broader meaning, such as &quot;a place of the reeds&quot;. Instead of a toponym for a specific settlement, it is also used as a qualifier to denote a category of densely populated cities.

Teotihuacan seems to have been the first city known by this name. After the collapse of the Teotihuacan empire, central Mexico broke into smaller states. The Toltec created the first sizable Mexican empire after the fall of Teotihuacan, and their capital was referred to by the same name as a reference to the earlier greatness of Teotihuacan.

In Aztec accounts at the time of the arrival of the Conquistadores, Teotihuacan and the Toltec capital sometimes seem to be confused and conflated.

The epithet &quot;Tollan&quot; was also sometimes applied to any great metropolis or capital. Cholula, for example, was sometimes called &quot;Tollan Cholula&quot;, and the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán was likewise given the title &quot;Tollan&quot;. The Mixtec translation of this, &quot;Ñuu Co&#x27;yo&quot; is still the Mixtec name for Mexico City to this day.

==Tollan in Mesoamerican mythology==
Tollan is the name given to the mythical place of origin in many Mesoamerican traditions, including those of the Aztecs and the K&#x27;iche&#x27; Maya. In the K&#x27;iche&#x27; epic &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, the first people created are gathered at Tollan, the place of seven caves, where they receive their languages and their gods.

<doc id="376766" wikidata="Q896416" url="?curid=376766" title="German Federal Coast Guard">
<text>The German Federal Coast Guard () is a civilian law enforcement organisation whose primary missions are border protection, maritime environmental protection, shipping safety, fishery protection and customs enforcement. The &quot;Küstenwache&quot; is an association of several federal agencies, not a single entity like the United States Coast Guard.

The agencies that make up the &quot;Küstenwache&quot; have a common plan of action and direct their operations from two Coast Guard Centers (German: &quot;Küstenwachzentren&quot;), Neustadt (Holstein) for the Baltic Sea and Cuxhaven for the North Sea.

==Structure and responsibilities==


Since 2007 the Joint Situation Center Sea (GLZ-See) is in service. GLZ-See is coordinating the operational units of the federal government (Küstenwache) and the coastal states of Germany (Wasserschutzpolizei).

Units and personnel from these federal agencies make up the coast guard:

* &quot;Bundespolizei&quot; (Federal Police), Ministry of the Interior
* Waterways and Shipping Offices, Federal Waterways and Shipping Administration (WSV), Federal Ministry for Transport, Construction and Urban Development
* &quot;Kontrolleinheit See&quot; (Maritime Customs Service), Federal Customs Administration, Federal Ministry of Finance
* Federal Agency for Agriculture and Nutrition (BLE), Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food, and Agriculture

==Coast guard personnel==
The personnel serving with the &quot;Küstenwache&quot; include both police officers (in the case of the &quot;Bundespolizei&quot; and &quot;Wasserzoll&quot;) and civilians from the Waterways and Shipping Office and other agencies. &quot;Küstenwache&quot; personnel do not have combatant status as it is not a military unit as many other coast guards are. In contrast, the United States Coast Guard is both a military service and a law enforcement organisation and its commissioned officers have both police and military powers. However, police officers serving with the &quot;Küstenwache&quot; retain their usual police powers, adjusted to the maritime nature of their job.

==Ships and other vessels==

A total of 27 ships and boats from the aforementioned institutions are in operation (&quot;Bundespolizei&quot;: six ships; &quot;Wasserzoll&quot;: eight customs cutters, four customs cruisers; WSV: three multi-purpose ships; BLE: two fishery protection boats, three fishery research ships).

The ships are all marked with the legend &quot;Küstenwache&quot; as well as a black-red-gold signet on the hull and the coast guard&#x27;s coat-of-arms. However, the hull colour differs from agency to agency: blue for the &quot;Bundespolizei&quot;, green for the &quot;Zoll&quot; and black for the WSV and BLE.

A number of helicopters and planes are in use as well.

Some Ships:
*BP 24 &quot;Bad Bramstedt&quot; 
*BP 25 &quot;Bayreuth&quot; 
*BP 26 &quot;Eschwege&quot; 
*BP 81 &quot;Potsdam&quot; 
*BP 82 &quot;Bamberg&quot; 
*BP 83 &quot;Bad Düben&quot; 
*MS &quot;Priwall&quot;
*MS &quot;Kalkgrund&quot;
*FSB &quot;Seeadler&quot;
* &quot;Hamburg&quot;
*SUBS &quot;Mellum&quot;

<text>DESQview (DV) is a text mode multitasking operating environment developed by Quarterdeck Office Systems which enjoyed modest popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Running on top of DOS, it allows users to run multiple programs concurrently in multiple windows.

== Desq ==
Quarterdeck&#x27;s predecessor to DESQview was a task switching product called Desq (shipped late April or May 1984), which allows users to switch between running programs. Quarterdeck revamped its package, bringing multitasking in, and adding TopView compatibility.

DESQview was released in July 1985, four months before Microsoft released the first version of Windows. It was widely thought to be the first program to bring multitasking and windowing capabilities to DOS; in fact, there was a predecessor, IBM TopView, which shipped March 1985.

Under DESQview, well-behaved DOS programs can be run concurrently in resizable, overlapping windows (something the first version of Windows cannot do). A simple hideable menu allows cutting and pasting between programs. DESQview provides support for simple editable macros as well. Quarterdeck also developed a set of optional utilities for DESQview, including a notepad and dialer. Later versions allow graphics mode programs to be loaded as well, but only run in full screen mode.

DESQview is not a GUI (graphical user interface) operating system. Rather, it is a non-graphical, windowed shell that runs in real mode on top of DOS, although it can run on any Intel 8086- or Intel 80286-based PC. It can also use expanded memory add-ons to work around the 640 KB RAM limit of conventional memory on early PCs. DESQview really came into its own on Intel 80386 machines, which are better at utilizing memory above DOS&#x27;s limit. However, in either case, it runs in real mode rather than protected mode, meaning that a misbehaving program can still crash the system.

== DESQview and QEMM ==
To make maximum use of extended memory on Intel 80386 processors, by transforming it into expanded memory and upper memory blocks (UMBs) accessible to DESQview and other real-mode programs, Quarterdeck developed a sophisticated memory manager. Owing to the foresight of its marketing manager, Quarterdeck marketed it as a separate product, QEMM-386 (Quarterdeck Expanded Memory Manager 386). It became more popular than DESQview itself, and sold steadily for many years, generating over US$150 million in sales from 1987 through 1994. After the release of the Intel Pentium processor, the &quot;386&quot; in QEMM was dropped. The combination package of DESQview and QEMM-386 was called DESQview 386 (DV386).

With the introduction of the 80386, the memory management features were enhanced to allow the system to shift into protected mode but also allow the addresses to be configured in a virtual 8086 mode so that the extended memory can be mapped into addressing frames and accessible to real-mode programs such as DOS. This allows a 386 to implement the LIM (Lotus, Intel, Microsoft) EMS (expanded memory specification). The memory manager is easily controlled by the user with DOS program QEMM.COM.

DESQview is able to use QEMM&#x27;s features far beyond just the LIM EMS API, mapping most of the &quot;conventional&quot; address space (below 640 KB) into multiple extended memory blocks such that each can execute transparently during its context. The main copy of DOS and any device and networking drivers have to be loaded before DESQview. The resulting space is the largest single program that can run, but DESQview under QEMM can run as many instances of those programs as the EMS allows. So an 8 MB system can generally have a dozen full-sized DOS programs running concurrently; a 16 MB system can run over twenty, and so on.

== DESQview usage ==
DESQview was noteworthy in that it supported all common DOS-compatible programs and achieved a degree of performance and stability that was remarkable, given the constraints of its host operating system. It also has a clever interface that is generally unobtrusive while being quickly available and very easy to learn.

All normal PCs include a keyboard with three &quot;shift&quot; or &quot;modifier&quot; keys: Control, Alt, and the normal Shift keys. These keys are normally held down in combination with other keys. DESQview, by default, monitors the Alt key for isolated presses (not in combination). Pressing the Alt key by itself brings up the DESQview menu allowing access to the program&#x27;s features: start new tasks, switch among them, mark text on the screen, paste text as input into the current task, resize or move the text windows, configure new menu items, etc. In addition a Shift+Alt combination causes DESQview to learn a set of keys as a macro. This allows DESQview to run other programs without interfering with any of the &quot;keybindings&quot; they might be using.

DESQview was critically acclaimed and won many fans, but it never met with mass appeal, despite Quarterdeck&#x27;s sustained efforts to win people over.

In one area, however, DESQview was a lasting success: many multiuser bulletin board systems were based on it, thanks to its modest hardware requirements, robust multitasking, and superlative handling of multiple communication ports. Most free or inexpensive BBS software of the time ran as a single-node, single-tasking DOS program. Normally, only one copy of the BBS software could run at once, limiting the host PC to running one node. DESQview allows multiple copies of these single-task programs to run at once on the same computer, allowing anyone with even unimpressive hardware to run a large, powerful, multiuser BBS out of their home.

== Decline of DESQview ==
DESQview does not provide a graphical user interface (GUI). While Quarterdeck did provide suites of programming libraries and utilities to support the development of software to use its features these never became widely popular. DESQview&#x27;s ability to run most software with no modification and the cost of &quot;run-time&quot; licenses, combined with the costs of the development suites themselves made this an unreasonable combination for commercial shrink-wrapped software publishers and vendors.

Microsoft released Windows 3.0 with its own memory management and multitasking features. While DESQview was far faster, smaller, and more stable, it was more expensive and didn&#x27;t include support for the graphical features of MS Windows.

The decline of QEMM started with the bundling of a memory manager in Digital Research&#x27;s DR DOS 5.0, released in 1990. To catch on, Microsoft included its own EMM386 in MS-DOS 5.0, while previously the memory management functionality was only available with Windows. QEMM could still be used instead, notably with Windows 3.1x, but only for incremental benefit. Sales of QEMM declined. In August 1994, after three quarters of losses, the company laid off 25% of their employees and the CEO, president, and founder Terry Myers resigned.

As users moved from DESQview to other platforms, notably Windows 3.x and OS/2, third party utility authors wrote utility programs that emulated some DESQview API functions to allow suitably equipped DOS programs to co-operate with these OS. The most notable are TAME (for Windows) and OS/2SPEED (for OS/2).

=== DESQview/X ===
Quarterdeck eventually also released a product named DESQview/X (DVX), which is an X Window System server running under DOS and DESQview and thus provides a GUI to which X software (mostly Unix) could be ported.

DESQview/X had three window managers that it launched with, X/Motif, OPEN LOOK, and twm. The default package contained only &quot;twm&quot;, the others were costly optional extras, as was the ability to interact on TCP/IP networks. Mosaic was ported to DVX.

DVX itself can serve DOS programs and the 16-bit Windows environment across the network as X programs, which made it useful for those who wished to run DOS and Windows programs from their Unix workstations. The same functionality is available with some versions of NCD Wincenter.

=== NetWare Access Server ===
Internetworking company Novell developed a product called NetWare Access Server (NAS) incorporating features of DESQview 386 and pcAnywhere. The DESQview multitasking support was used to create an environment into which up to 16 PC and Macintosh clients can login remotely to access NetWare services and run DOS applications.

=== DESQview after X ===
DESQview development continued in parallel with DESQview/X. After ceasing development on DESQview/X, another version of DESQview was released. QEMM was still developed after the discontinuation of DESQview, and a version compatible with Windows 98 was released.

In the mid-1990s, Quarterdeck tried to recast itself as an Internet company, releasing a version of the Mosaic web browser. Eventually, the company was acquired by Symantec.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1984 stated that DesQ&#x27;s application compatibility was the highest of the five window managers tested. The magazine&#x27;s Jerry Pournelle in 1989 noted that &quot;while MultiFinder doesn&#x27;t work very well yet, DESQView on a big 80386 machine certainly does&quot;. The magazine that year listed version 3.0 as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that &quot;unlike OS/2, DESQview lets you run the programs you&#x27;ve already paid for ... Many users will find that DESQview is all they need&quot;.

<text>Étienne Nicolas Méhul (; 22 June 1763 – 18 October 1817) was a French composer of the late classical and early romantic periods. He was known as &quot;the most important opera composer in France during the Revolution&quot;. He was also the first composer to be called a &quot;Romantic&quot;. He is known particularly for his operas, written in keeping with the reforms introduced by Christoph Willibald Gluck and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

== Life ==
Méhul was born at Givet in Ardennes to Jean-François Méhul, a wine merchant, and his wife Marie-Cécile (née Keuly). His first music lessons came from a blind local organist. When he showed promise, he was sent to study with a German musician and organist, , at the monastery of Lavaldieu, a few miles from Givet. Here Méhul developed his lifelong love of flowers.

In 1778 or 1779 he went to Paris and began to study with Jean-Frédéric Edelmann, a harpsichord player and friend of Méhul&#x27;s idol Christoph Willibald Gluck. Méhul&#x27;s first published composition was a book of piano pieces in 1783. He also arranged airs from popular operas and by the late 1780s he had begun to think about an operatic career for himself.

In 1787, the writer Valadier offered Méhul one of his libretti, &quot;Cora&quot;, which had been rejected by Gluck in 1785. The Académie royale de musique (the Paris Opéra) put Méhul&#x27;s work, under the title &quot;Alonzo et Cora&quot;, into rehearsal in June 1789. However, the rehearsals were abandoned on 8 August, probably because the Opéra had been suffering severe financial difficulties throughout the 1780s, and the opera was not premiered until 1791. In the meantime, Méhul found an ideal collaborator in the librettist François-Benoît Hoffman, who provided the words to the first of Méhul&#x27;s operas to be performed, &quot;Euphrosine&quot;. Its premiere in 1790 was an immense success and marked the composer out as a new talent. It was also the start of his long relationship with the Comédie Italienne theatre (soon to be renamed the Opéra-Comique).

In spite of the failure of &quot;Cora&quot; in 1791 and the banning of &quot;Adrien&quot; for political reasons the year after that, Méhul consolidated his reputation with works such as &quot;Stratonice&quot; and &quot;Mélidore et Phrosine&quot;. During the French Revolution, Méhul composed many patriotic songs and propaganda pieces, the most famous of which is the &quot;Chant du départ&quot;. Méhul was rewarded by becoming the first composer named to the newly founded Institut de France in 1795. He also held a post as one of the five inspectors of the Conservatoire de Paris. Méhul was on friendly terms with Napoleon and became one of the first Frenchmen to receive the Légion d&#x27;honneur.
Méhul&#x27;s operatic success was not as great in the first decade of the nineteenth century as it had been in the 1790s, although works such as &quot;Joseph&quot; (1807) became famous abroad, particularly in Germany. The failure of his opera &quot;Les amazones&quot; in 1811 was a severe blow and virtually ended his career as a composer for the theatre. Despite his friendship with Napoleon, Méhul&#x27;s public standing survived the transition to the Bourbon Restoration intact. However, the composer was now seriously ill with tuberculosis and he died on 18 October 1817. His grave is at Père Lachaise Cemetery, near the grave of the composer François Joseph Gossec.

In 1797 Méhul adopted his seven-year-old nephew, composer Joseph Daussoigne-Méhul, and Joseph&#x27;s younger brother. He played a major role in his nephew&#x27;s musical education and career; counting him among his pupils at the Conservatoire de Paris. After his death, Daussoigne-Méhul completed Méhul&#x27;s unfinished opera &quot;Valentine de Milan&quot; which premiered at the Opéra-Comique in 1822. He also wrote new recitatives for his opera &quot;Stratonice&quot; in 1821 for a revival of that work in Paris.

== Music ==

=== Operas ===
Méhul&#x27;s most important contribution to music was his operas. He led the generation of composers who emerged in France in the 1790s, which included his friend and rival Luigi Cherubini and his outright enemy Jean-François Le Sueur. Méhul followed the example of the operas which Gluck had written for Paris in the 1770s and applied Gluck&#x27;s &quot;reforms&quot; to opéra comique (a genre which mixed music with spoken dialogue and was not necessarily at all &quot;comic&quot; in mood). But he pushed music in a more Romantic direction, showing an increased use of dissonance and an interest in psychological states such as anger and jealousy, thus foreshadowing later Romantic composers such as Weber and Berlioz. Indeed, Méhul was the first composer to be styled a Romantic; a critic used the term in &quot;La chronique de Paris&quot; on 1 April 1793 when reviewing Méhul&#x27;s &quot;Le jeune sage et le vieux fou&quot;.

Méhul&#x27;s main musical concern was that everything should serve to increase the dramatic impact. As his admirer Berlioz wrote:[Méhul] was fully convinced that in truly dramatic music, when the importance of the situation deserves the sacrifice, the composer should not hesitate as between a pretty musical effect that is foreign to the scenic or dramatic character, and a series of accents that are true but do not yield any surface pleasure. He was convinced that musical expressiveness is a lovely flower, delicate and rare, of exquisite fragrance, which does not bloom without culture, and which a breath can wither; that it does not dwell in melody alone, but that everything concurs either to create or destroy it – melody, harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation, the choice of deep or high registers for the voices or instruments, a quick or slow tempo, and the several degrees of volume in the sound emitted.

One way in which Méhul increased dramatic expressivity was to experiment with orchestration. For example, in &quot;Uthal&quot;, an opera set in the Highlands of Scotland, he eliminated violins from the orchestra, replacing them with the darker sounds of violas in order to add local colour. Méhul&#x27;s &quot;La chasse du jeune Henri&quot; (Young Henri&#x27;s Hunt) provides a more humorous example, with its expanded horn section portraying yelping hounds as well as giving hunting calls. (Sir Thomas Beecham frequently programmed this piece to showcase the Royal Philharmonic horn section.)

Méhul&#x27;s key works of the 1790s were &quot;Euphrosine&quot;, &quot;Stratonice&quot;, &quot;Mélidore et Phrosine&quot; and &quot;Ariodant.&quot; &quot;Ariodant&quot;, though a failure at its premiere in 1799, has come in for particular praise from critics. Elizabeth Bartlet calls it &quot;Mehul&#x27;s best work of the decade and a highpoint of Revolutionary opera&quot;. It deals with the same tale of passion and jealousy as Handel&#x27;s 1735 opera &quot;Ariodante&quot;. As in many of his other operas, Mehul makes use of a structural device called the &quot;reminiscence motif&quot;, a musical theme associated with a particular character or idea in the opera. This device looks forward to the leitmotifs in Richard Wagner&#x27;s music dramas. In &quot;Ariodant&quot;, the reminiscence motif is the &quot;cri de fureur&quot; (&quot;cry of fury&quot;), expressing the emotion of jealousy.

Around 1800, the popularity of such stormy dramas began to wane, replaced by a fashion for the lighter opéra comiques of composers such as François-Adrien Boieldieu. In addition, Mehul&#x27;s friend Napoleon told him he preferred a more comic style of opera. As a Corsican, Napoleon&#x27;s cultural background was Italian, and he loved the opera buffa of composers like Paisiello and Cimarosa. Méhul responded with &quot;L&#x27;irato&quot; (&quot;The Angry Man&quot;), a one-act comedy premiered as the work of the Italian composer &quot;Fiorelli&quot; in 1801. When it became an immediate success, Méhul revealed the hoax he had played. Méhul also continued to compose works in a more serious vein. &quot;Joseph&quot;, based on the Biblical story of Joseph and his brothers, is the most famous of these later operas, but its success in France was short-lived. In Germany, however, it won many admirers throughout the nineteenth century, including Wagner. A melody from &quot;Joseph&quot; is very similar to a popular folk melody widely known in Germany which was used as a song in the Imperial German Navy, and adapted, notoriously, as the tune for the co-national anthem of Nazi Germany, the &quot;Horst-Wessel-Lied&quot;. It is unclear, however, whether Méhul&#x27;s melody was the actual provenance of the melody.

=== Symphonies and other works ===
Besides operas, Méhul composed a number of songs for the festivals of the republic (often commissioned by the emperor Napoleon), cantatas, and five symphonies in the years 1797 and 1808 to 1810.

Mehul&#x27;s First Symphony (1808) is notable for its dissonant and violent mood, and has been compared to Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, written in the same year. Taking inspiration from the more anguished works of Haydn and Mozart, such as Haydn&#x27;s Sturm und Drang and later Paris Symphonies of 1785–86 and Mozart&#x27;s Symphony No. 40 (K. 550, 1788), it was revived in one of Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s concerts with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra in 1838 and 1846 to an audience including Robert Schumann, who was impressed by the piece. (At the time of writing, only Beethoven&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 1 and 2 [1799/1800 and 1802] had been performed in France.) His other symphonies also followed German and Austrian models. Commenting after the premiere of his first symphony, he noted: &quot;I understood all the dangers of my enterprise; I foresaw the cautious welcome that the music-lovers would give my symphonies. I plan to write new ones for next winter and shall try to write them… to accustom the public gradually to think that a Frenchman may follow Haydn and Mozart at a distance.&quot;

A fifth symphony was never completed—&quot;as disillusionment and tuberculosis took their toll&quot;, in the words of David Charlton. The Symphonies Nos. 3 and 4 were only rediscovered by Charlton in 1979. Interviewed 8 November 2010 on the BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, Professor Charlton said that Méhul&#x27;s 4th Symphony was the first ever to employ the cyclical principle.

<text>An incandescent gas mantle, gas mantle or Welsbach mantle is a device for generating incandescent bright white light when heated by a flame. The name refers to its original heat source in gas lights which illuminated the streets of Europe and North America in the late 19th century. &quot;Mantle&quot; refers to the way it hangs like a cloak above the flame. Gas mantles were also used in portable camping lanterns, pressure lanterns and some oil lamps.

Gas mantles are usually sold as a fabric bag which, because of impregnation with metal nitrates, burns away to leave a rigid but fragile mesh of metal oxides when heated during initial use; these metal oxides produce light from the heat of the flame whenever used. Thorium dioxide was commonly a major component; being radioactive, it has led to concerns about the safety of those involved in manufacturing mantles. Normal use, however, poses minimal health risk.

== Mechanism ==

The mantle is a roughly pear-shaped fabric bag, made from silk, ramie-based artificial silk, or rayon. The fibers are impregnated with metallic salts; when the mantle is first heated in a flame, the fibers burn away in seconds and the metallic salts convert to solid oxides, forming a brittle ceramic oxide shell in the shape of the original fabric. A mantle glows brightly in the visible spectrum while emitting little infrared radiation. The rare-earth (cerium) and actinide (thorium) oxides in the mantle have a low emissivity in the infrared (in comparison with an ideal black body) but have high emissivity in the visible spectrum. There is also some evidence that the emission is enhanced by candoluminescence, the emission of light from the combustion products before they reach thermal equilibrium. The combination of these properties yields a mantle that, when heated by a kerosene or liquified petroleum gas flame, emits intense radiation that is mostly visible light, with relatively little energy in the unwanted infrared, increasing the luminous efficiency.

The mantle aids the combustion process by keeping the flame small and contained at higher fuel flow rates than in a simple lamp. Concentrating combustion inside the mantle improves the transfer of heat from the flame to the mantle. The mantle shrinks after all the fabric material has burned away during installation leaving a very fragile ceramic oxide shell after its first use.

== History ==
For centuries, artificial light has been generated using open flames. Limelight was invented in the 1820s, but the temperature required to produce visible light through black-body radiation alone was too high to be practical for small lights. In the late 19th century, several inventors tried to develop an effective alternative based on heating a material to a lower temperature but using the emission of discrete spectral lines to simulate white light.

Many early attempts used platinum-iridium gauze soaked in metal nitrates, but these were not successful because of the high cost of these materials and their poor reliability. The first effective mantle was the Clamond basket in 1881, named after its inventor. This device was made from a matrix of magnesium oxide, which did not need to be supported by a platinum wire cage, and was exhibited in the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1883.

The modern gas mantle was one of the many inventions of Carl Auer von Welsbach, a chemist who studied rare-earth elements in the 1880s and who had been Robert Bunsen&#x27;s student. Ignaz Kreidl worked with him on his early experiments to create the Welsbach mantle. His first process used a mixture of 60% magnesium oxide, 20% lanthanum oxide and 20% yttrium oxide, which he called &quot;Actinophor&quot; and patented in 1887 (March 15, 1887, US patent #359,524). These original mantles gave off a green-tinted light and were not very successful. Welsbach&#x27;s first company established a factory in Atzgersdorf in 1887, but it failed in 1889. In 1889, Welsbach received his first patent mentioning thorium (March 5, 1889, US patent #399,174). In 1891 he perfected a new mixture of 99% thorium dioxide and 1% cerium dioxide that gave off a much whiter light and produced a stronger mantle. After introducing this new mantle commercially in 1892, it quickly spread throughout Europe. The gas mantle remained an important part of street lighting until the widespread introduction of electric lighting in the early 1900s.

== Production ==

To produce a mantle, cotton is woven or knit into a net bag, impregnated with soluble nitrates of the chosen metals, and then transported to its destination. The user installs the mantle and then burns it to remove the cotton bag and convert the metal nitrates to nitrites which fuse together to form a solid mesh. As the heating continues, the nitrites finally decompose into a fragile mesh of solid oxides with very high melting points.

Early mantles were sold in the unheated cotton mesh condition, since the post heating oxide structure was too fragile to transport easily. The mantle converts to its working form when the cotton burns away on first use. Originally, unused mantles could not be stored for very long because the cotton quickly rotted due to the corrosive nature of the acidic metal nitrates. The acidic metal corrosion was later addressed by soaking the mantle in an ammonia solution to neutralize the excess acid.

Later mantles were made from guncotton (nitrocellulose) which can be produced with extremely fine threads when compared with ordinary cotton threads. These had to be converted back to cellulose by immersion in ammonium sulfide before first use as guncotton is highly flammable and can be explosive. Later, it was discovered that a cotton mantle could be strengthened sufficiently by dipping it in a solution of collodion to coat it with a thin layer that would be burned off when the mantle was first used.

Mantles have a binding thread to tie them to the lamp fitting. Until asbestos was banned due to its carcinogenicity, an asbestos thread was used. Modern mantles use a wire or a ceramic fiber thread.

== Safety concerns ==

Thorium is radioactive and produces the radioactive gas radon-220 as one of its decay products. Moreover, when heated to incandescence, the thorium volatilizes its in-growth radio-daughters, particularly radium-224. Despite its very short half-life, radium quickly replenishes from its radio-parent (thorium-228), and every new heating of the mantle to incandescence releases a fresh flush of radium-224 into the air. This byproduct can be inhaled if the mantle is used indoors, and is an internal alpha-emitter radio-toxicity concern. Secondary decay products of thorium include radium and actinium. Because of this, there are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency recommends mantles made with yttrium instead. 

A study in 1981 estimated that the dose from using a thorium mantle every weekend for a year would be , tiny in comparison to the normal annual background radiation dose of around , although this assumes the thorium remains intact rather than airborne. A person actually ingesting a mantle would receive a dose of . However, the radioactivity is a major concern for people involved with the manufacture of mantles and an issue with contamination of soil around some former factory sites. 

One potential cause for concern is that particles from thorium gas mantles &quot;fall out&quot; over time and get into the air, where they may be ingested in food or drink. These particles may also be inhaled and remain in the lungs or liver, causing long-term exposure exceeding the risk of background radiation. Also of concern is the release of thorium-bearing dust if the mantle shatters due to mechanical impact.

All of these issues have led to the use of alternatives in some countries, usually yttrium or sometimes zirconium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Safety concerns were the subject of a federal suit against the Coleman Company (&quot;Wagner v. Coleman&quot;), which initially agreed to place warning labels on the mantles for this concern, and subsequently switched to using yttrium.

In June 2001, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission published a study about the &quot;Systematic Radiological Assessment of Exemptions for Source and Byproduct Materials&quot;, stating that radioactive gas mantles are explicitly legal in the US.

<text>Larzac (, ), also known as the Causse of Larzac (French: &quot;Causse du Larzac&quot;; ), is a limestone karst plateau in the south of the Massif Central, France, situated between Millau (in the department of Aveyron) and Lodève (in the department of Hérault). It is an agricultural area, where traditionally sheep produce milk for Roquefort cheese. Since the early 2010s, the agricultural production has largely diversified.

==Geography==
The communes of the Larzac are:
*Cornus
*Creissels
*La Cavalerie
*La Couvertoirade
*La Roque-Sainte-Marguerite
*L&#x27;Hospitalet-du-Larzac
*Le Caylar
*Le Cros
*Les Rives
*Millau
*Nant
*Saint-Félix-de-l&#x27;Héras
*Saint-Georges-de-Luzençon
*Saint-Maurice-Navacelles
*Saint-Michel-d&#x27;Alajou
*Saint-Pierre-de-la-Fage
*Sainte-Eulalie-de-Cernon
*Sorbs
*La Vacquerie-et-Saint-Martin-de-Castries
*Vissec

The Larzac is served by junctions 46 to 51 of the A75 autoroute.

==History==

In October 1970, Michel Debré, then Minister of Defence, decided for strategic purposes to expand a military camp outside the village of La Cavalerie in the department of Aveyron, from 30 km2 to 170 km2, without consulting the local population. Local farmers objected and decided to fight against the project, through actions such as the occupation of empty farms purchased by the Army in anticipation of this expansion. French syndicalist and peasant activist José Bové moved there during this period in support of the protests. Communards from the nearby Community of the Ark, led by the pacifist Lanza del Vasto, were also very active in opposition to the camp. The workers of the occupied and self-managed LIP factory also took part in the movement.

Following ten years of nonviolent resistance, the plan was cancelled by President François Mitterrand after his election in 1981.

Because of its history, the Larzac was chosen as the site of a massive meeting against the WTO which took place in August 2003. José Bové currently resides in the Larzac area; he secured nearly 500,000 votes in the 2007 presidential election. He became a Member of the European Parliament in 2009.

==Sights==
Five medieval fortified villages, related to the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller are located on the Larzac plateau: 
* La Cavalerie
* La Couvertoirade
* Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Alcas, part of the Saint-Jean-et-Saint-Paul commune
* Sainte-Eulalie-de-Cernon
* Viala-du-Pas-de-Jaux

<doc id="376786" wikidata="Q4787084" url="?curid=376786" title="Architecture Neutral Distribution Format">
<text>The Architecture Neutral Distribution Format (ANDF) in computing is a technology allowing common &quot;shrink wrapped&quot; binary application programs to be distributed for use on conformant Unix systems, translated to run on different underlying hardware platforms. ANDF was defined by the Open Software Foundation and was expected to be a &quot;truly revolutionary technology that will significantly advance the cause of portability and open systems&quot;, but it was never widely adopted.

As with other OSF offerings, ANDF was specified through an open selection process. OSF issued a Request for Technology for architecture-neutral software distribution technologies in April, 1989. Fifteen proposals were received, based on a variety of technical approaches, including obscured source code, compiler intermediate languages, and annotated executable code.

The technology of ANDF, chosen after an evaluation of competing approaches and implementations, was Ten15 Distribution Format, later renamed TenDRA Distribution Format, developed by the UK Defence Research Agency.

==Adoption==

ANDF was intended to benefit both software developers and users. Software developers could release a single binary for all platforms, and software users would have freedom to procure multiple vendors&#x27; hardware competitively. Programming language designers and implementors were also interested because standard installers would mean that only a single language front end would need to be developed.

OSF released several development &#x27;snapshots&#x27; of ANDF, but it was never released commercially by OSF or any of its members. Various reasons have been proposed for this: for example, that having multiple installation systems would complicate software support.

After OSF stopped working on ANDF, development continued at other organizations.

<doc id="376787" wikidata="Q3984931" url="?curid=376787" title="Controller of the Navy (Royal Navy)">
<text>The post of Controller of the Navy (abbreviated as CofN) was originally created in 1859 when the Surveyor of the Navy&#x27;s title changed to Controller of the Navy. In 1869 the controller&#x27;s office was abolished and its duties were assumed by that of the Third Naval Lord whose title then changed to Third Naval Lord and Controller of the Navy. In 1904 the title was changed again to Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy. In 1965 the office of the Third Sea Lord was abolished. The post-holder is responsible for procurement and matériel in the British Royal Navy.

Originally the post-holder was a member of the Board of Admiralty and later a member of the Admiralty Board.

==History==
The original office of Comptroller of the Navy was established in 1561 during the reign of Elizabeth I of England which was a very different function from what became known later as the &quot;Controller of the Navy&quot;. They presided over the Navy Board from 1660, and generally superintended the business of the Navy Office, they were responsible for all naval spending and for the offices dealing with bills, accounts and wages during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By the eighteenth century the principal officer responsible for estimating annual stores requirements, inspecting ships&#x27; stores and maintaining the Fleet&#x27;s store-books and repair-bills was the Surveyor of the Navy however their duties passed increasingly to the Comptroller of the Navy during the latter half of this period. The office of the Surveyor did not altogether disappear. In 1805 for the first time, specific functions were assigned to each of the &#x27;Naval&#x27; Lords, who were described as &#x27;Professional&#x27; Lords, leaving to the civil lords to the routine business of signing off all official documents. In 1832 the original office of the Comptroller was abolished following a merger with the Board of Admiralty and the Surveyor was made the officer responsible under the First Sea Lord for the material departments. In 1859 the office the Surveyor of the Navy who had overall responsibility for ship design was renamed and the post became known as the Controller of the Navy.

In the re-organisation of the Admiralty by Order in Council of 14 January 1869, the Controller of the Navy was given a seat on the Board of Admiralty as the Third Lord and Controller of the Navy. They also inherited the new duties of the Storekeeper-General of the Navy, whose post was abolished. The Controller lost the title of Third Lord and the seat on the board by an Order in Council of 19 March 1872, but regained them by a further Order in Council of 10 March 1882. In 1872 they again became subordinate to the First Sea Lord, but had the right to attend board meetings when the business of the department was under discussion. In 1882 the Controller again became independent of the First Sea Lord and became a board member again as Third Naval Lord and Controller. The Third Naval Lord&#x27;s post was renamed to become known as the Third Sea Lord and Controller in 1904. The appointment of Controller of the Navy was abolished in September 1912, although that of Third Sea Lord remained. Thereafter, except for a period in 1917 to 1918 when there was a civilian Controller, the titles of Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy went together.

The Third Sea Lord and Controller was mainly responsible for superintending the work of the Royal Naval Scientific Service and for a number of Admiralty departments, including those of the Department of the Director of Naval Construction, (from 1958 the Department of the Director General Ships), of the Department of the Engineer in Chief (formerly the Steam Department), of the Department of the Director of Naval Ordnance, of the Department of the Director of Dockyards and, following a board decision in 1911, of the Admiralty Compass Observatory, formerly under the control of the Hydrographer&#x27;s Department War they also had responsibility for the supply of equipment to Combined Operations Headquarters. From 1958 the Fourth Sea Lord was also known as &quot;Vice Controller of the Navy&quot; they assumed the superintendence of the naval dockyard organisation and the maintenance of the fleet. In 1965 the appointment of Third Sea Lord was abolished and the individual responsible for the materiel side of the navy became simply Controller of the Navy. From 2003 until April 2013 the post holder jointly held different titles such as ( Director, Land Maritime, 2003–2006, Director-General, Nuclear, 2006–2009, Capability Manager/Director (Precision Attack), 2009-2012 and Director, Maritime Capability and Transformation, 2012–2013. From April 2013 until November 2018 the post holder simultaneously held the titles of Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Capability) and Chief of Staff Navy Command (HQ) post holders include: From November 2018, the post holder has been just Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Capability). ACNS Capability is also known as Director Develop as of September 2020.
