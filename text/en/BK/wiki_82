<text>The Tasman Bridge is a prestressed concrete girder bridge connecting the Tasman Highway over the River Derwent in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. When it opened on 29 March 1965, the Tasman was the longest prestressed concrete bridge in Australia, with a total length measuring , including approaches. The bridge provides a vital link between Hobart&#x27;s city centre on the western shore and the City of Clarence on the eastern shore. Averaging 73,029 vehicle crossings per day, the bridge is the highest volume road section in Tasmania. It features five lanes of traffic including a central lane equipped for tidal flow operations and separated shared-use walkways on both sides, with ramp upgrades for improved access and cyclists completed in 2010.

The Tasman Bridge gained national attention following the Tasman Bridge disaster. On 5 January 1975, the bridge was struck by the bulk ore carrier SS &quot;Lake Illawarra&quot;, bound for EZ Industries&#x27; Risdon Zinc Works with a cargo of of zinc concentrate. It caused two piers and three sections of concrete decking totalling , to collapse and sink the vessel, resulting in the loss of twelve lives. The disaster split the city in half, forcing commuters living on the eastern shore to make a round trip to the CBD via the next bridge to the north. The crisis is unique in that no similar analysis of a city divided into two parts could be referenced. After two-and-a-half years, the Tasman Bridge reopened on 8 October 1977.
The Bowen Bridge was subsequently constructed to mitigate any future failure of the Tasman Bridge.

In June 2022, the Tasmanian transport ministry revealed a $130 million investment in the Tasman Bridge, the largest since its 1977 reconstruction. Designed by GHD Group with a target completion date set for 2025, the upgrades encompass wider dedicated paths for cyclists and pedestrians, increased barriers between vehicles and pedestrians, improved lighting and digital signage. In September 2024 the Tasmanian government announced that it had scrapped plans to widen the pathway although they will continue with plans to raise barriers and add passing bays.

== History ==
During the 1950s, Hobart&#x27;s eastern shore underwent substantial expansion due to the opening of the Hobart International Airport at Cambridge in 1956. By 1957, the airport was the country&#x27;s fifth busiest, and the surge in air travel, associated automobile usage and surrounding developments led to a notable rise in traffic, overwhelming the capacity of the existing Hobart Bridge. With its single carriageway struggling to manage escalating traffic volumes and frequent disruptions due to the lifting of the bridge&#x27;s lift span for passing ships, a necessity emerged for a novel bridge solution. These challenges highlighted the pressing need for a new, more accommodating bridge designed specifically for the increased traffic flow without constant interruptions for maritime navigation.

=== Design ===
In 1956, Tasmania&#x27;s Department of Public Works commissioned Maunsell &amp; Partners Pty Ltd to design the new River Derwent crossing. The stable foundation for the bridge was ensured by the favorable conditions of the riverbed between Queens Domain and Montagu Bay on the eastern shore, which includes bedrock, dolerite, and basalt beneath the silt. The engineers recommended a bridge supported by multiple piers due to the width of the water expanse, similar to that of the Sydney Harbour Bridge but requiring a comparable height to accommodate medium-sized cargo vessels. Consequently, a decision was made to construct a girder bridge featuring twenty-two spans, including a navigation span at its apex, with thirteen spans to the west and six spans to the east, each measuring wide. To achieve the height of the apex, a large sequence of interval spans was critical in the design to accommodate the weight of concrete required for each heightened pier, with its deepest pile measuring below mean sea level.

Criticism of then-Premier Eric Reece arose in 1958 when concerns were raised by engineers about the susceptibility of the concrete design to potential ship collisions. Investigative reports revealed Reece&#x27;s dismissal of objections during parliamentary proceedings in favor of the $14 million project over a slightly more expensive suspension bridge option.

===Construction===

Tenders were issued in April 1959, and contracts were subsequently awarded to Reed, Braithwaite, Stuart, and Lipscombe in November of the same year.
Construction on the eastern shore viaduct commenced in May 1960. A labour force of over 400 workers were employed during peak construction.

Several prerequisites were crucial during construction. The old Hobart Bridge had to remain operational until the Tasman Bridge&#x27;s completion, and shipping lanes along the River Derwent needed to stay open. The construction posed significant challenges for Hobart as it marked the city&#x27;s largest and most expensive undertaking to date. Procuring construction equipment, such as jacks and wires, required sourcing from the UK, while reinforced steel had to be imported from the Australian mainland, contributing to the bridge&#x27;s elevated cost, totaling £7 million, equivalent to $14 million in 2015.

The first two lanes bridge opened on 18 August 1964. The other two lanes opened on 23 December 1964. It was officially opened on 29 March 1965 by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. Upon completion, the Tasman Bridge was the longest prestressed concrete bridge in Australia, utilising of concrete and of reinforcement steel.

== Disaster ==
On 5 January 1975, the SS &quot;Lake Illawarra&quot;, a bulk ore carrier, collided bow first with the pile capping of Pier 19 and then amidships with Pier 18 while en route to EZ Industries&#x27; Risdon Zinc Works with a cargo of of zinc concentrate. These successive impacts led to the collapse of both piers, their supporting pylons, and three unsupported sections of the bridge deck spanning , causing the vessel to sink and resulting in the deaths of seven crew members. Five motorists lost their lives when four cars drove over the collapsed sections before traffic was halted. A major press shot showed a Holden Monaro HQ and Holden EK perched balancing on the ledge.

The breakage of an important arterial link isolated the residents in Hobart&#x27;s eastern suburbs – the relatively short drive across the Tasman Bridge to the city suddenly became a journey via the estuary&#x27;s next bridge at Bridgewater. The only other vehicular crossing within Hobart after the bridge collapsed was the Risdon Punt, a cable ferry which crossed the river from East Risdon and Risdon, some upstream from the bridge. It was totally inadequate, carrying only eight cars on each crossing, and although ferries provided a service across the river; it was not until December 1975 that a two lane, bailey bridge was opened to traffic, to the north from Dowsing Point to Cleburne Point thereby restoring some connectivity. The bailey bridge remained in use until replaced by the Bowen Bridge in 1984.

The separation of Hobart saw an immediate surge in the small and limited passenger ferry service then operating across the river. In a primary position to provide a service were the two ferries of Bob Clifford.
He had introduced the locally-built ferries &quot;Matthew Brady&quot; and &quot;James McCabe&quot; to the river crossing, from the Hobart city centre to the eastern shore, shortly before the collision. These were soon joined by the , a wooden vessel of 1912 vintage, and &quot;Kosciusko, Lady Ferguson&quot; and &quot;Lady Wakehurst&quot; that were loaned by the New South Wales Public Transport Commission.

Following the Tasman Bridge Disaster, former-Premier Eric Reece maintained his defence of the chosen bridge design. Reece argued that the selected design was the sole financially viable option for the state at that time, despite the construction costs doubling throughout the project&#x27;s execution.

=== Reconstruction ===

Reconstruction of the Tasman Bridge by John Holland commenced in October 1975. Due to the amount of debris at the foundations, engineers decided not to rebuild Pier 18. Pier 17 on the western side of the gap was reinforced, and the pile cap and shaft of the pier above water level were replaced. A new pier was built at the site of the decimated Pier 19, and the existing Pier 20, on the eastern side of the gap, was repaired and strengthened. A new span, about long, was built in steel box girder construction between piers 17 and 19, and another new, prestressed concrete span, about meters long, was built from the new Pier 19 to Pier 20.

The annual expenditures on the Tasman Bridge reconstruction were $1.7 m in 1974–75; $12.3 m in 1975–76; $13.2 m in 1976–77 and $6.1m in 1977–78.
After two and half years and an approximate cost of $44 million, the Tasman Bridge reopened to the public on 8 October 1977.

Following the reopening of the bridge, the Port of Hobart implemented additional maritime safety measures, including directing large vessels to navigate slightly west of the original main navigation span and providing specialised training to harbour pilots in the use of a laser lighthouse for navigation. Additionally, the City of Hobart configured traffic systems to temporarily halt all road traffic when large vessels approach and pass under the bridge.

==Wreck of SS &quot;Lake Illawarra&quot;==

The average depth of the river between piers 17 and 19 is , with the wreck of the SS &quot;Lake Illawarra&quot; lying on the bottom covered by a scattering of concrete debris, presenting no navigational hazard to smaller watercraft. of zinc concentrate remain in the vessel&#x27;s cargo hold.

The wreck attracts regular visits from divers. In 2019, the Tasmanian University Dive Club shared underwater footage of the wreck on social media. This footage, championed as the clearest footage ever captured, was attributed by the Derwent Estuary Program to decreased sediment levels in the River Derwent, a result of improved stormwater management measures in the city.

In 2022, the CSIRO and Jacobs Engineering Group collaborated to produce the first complete 3D model of the wreck, bridge, riverbed, and shoreline. The mapping unveiled the ship&#x27;s placement adjacent to the bridge between piers 17 and 19 on the eastern shore, with its bow near Pier 19, angled at 45 degrees toward the centre of the river. The vessel&#x27;s bow lies roughly below the waterline, around from the eastern shore.

==Upgrades==
===Addition of fifth lane===
The bridge deck was widened to accommodate a fifth traffic lane during the bridge&#x27;s 1975 reconstruction. Utilising a Japanese construction method dubbed the &quot;Nippon clip-on,&quot; the central lane incorporates a reversible lane management system for tidal flow operations.

====Tidal flow operations====
Designed to optimise vehicle flow throughout the day, the reversible lane operates with a traffic light system and a sign above each lane. These signs, working in tandem with the traffic lights, utilise a pulley system to periodically shift over their respective lanes. During morning peak hours, the middle lane directs traffic towards the city side (or western shore), while during evening peak hours, it points back towards the eastern shore. Outside of peak hours, the lane generally directs traffic towards the eastern shore. This adaptable lane configuration maximises the bridge&#x27;s capacity and reduces congestion by efficiently utilising lanes according to current traffic demand.

===LED lighting===

In 2019 the Hobart City Council commissioned Decrolux to convert the Tasman bridge&#x27;s fluorescent lighting with modern LED lighting. Spanning almost and utilising 1,930 LEDs, the project was completed in 2021.
These remotely programmable lights have been utilized for various purposes, including commemorating annual events such as Dark Mofo and the TasPride parade, supporting sports teams like the Hobart Hurricanes and Tasmania JackJumpers, marking special occasions like the inauguration of Queen Mary of Denmark, and raising awareness for causes such as Women&#x27;s Health Week and Men&#x27;s Health Week.

===Sensors===
In 1987, a renovation initiative implemented the use of sensors to measure the currents of the river and the strength of winds, assisting ships in determining the optimal route for safe passage beneath the bridge.

<doc id="390124" wikidata="Q816629" url="?curid=390124" title="Ben Weber (composer)">
<text>William Jennings Bryan &quot;Ben&quot; Weber (July 23, 1916 in St. Louis – June 16, 1979 in New York City) was an American composer.

Weber He was &quot;one of the first Americans to embrace the 12-tone techniques of Schoenberg, starting in 1938&quot;; he was largely self-taught. He worked initially as a copyist and only came to recognition in the 1950s.

Weber used the twelve-tone technique but, rather than avoid tonality, he worked with it and achieved a virtuoso Romantic style: &quot;Weber could not stifle his bent for expansive lyricism and bold gestures,&quot; wrote music critic Anthony Tommasini, adding: &quot;One gets the sense that his adaptation of the 12-tone technique was his way of ensuring that his music would keep its cutting edge and not slip into Romanticism. There is a rather Brahmsian spirit trying to emerge here.&quot; He composed chamber music for various combinations of instruments, orchestral music including concertos for violin and piano, piano music, and songs.

Weber also wrote an unpublished memoir, &quot;How I Took 63 Years to Commit Suicide (as told to Matthew Paris).&quot;

==Awards==
Weber was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1950. He received a Thorne Music Award in 1965. which was given to composers of “mature years and recognized accomplishments&quot;.

<doc id="390131" wikidata="Q1073046" url="?curid=390131" title="Tokyo Metro Ginza Line">
<text>The is a subway line in Tokyo, Japan, operated by Tokyo Metro. The official name is . It is long and serves the wards of Shibuya, Minato, Chūō, Chiyoda, and Taitō. It is the oldest subway line in Asia, having opened in 1927.

The line was named after the Ginza commercial district in Chūō, Tokyo, under which it passes. On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color orange, and its stations are given numbers using the letter &quot;G&quot;.

==Operations==
Almost all Ginza Line trains operate on the line&#x27;s full length from Asakusa to Shibuya. However, two trains depart in the early morning from Toranomon, and some late-night trains from Shibuya are taken out of service at Ueno. Along with the Marunouchi Line, it is self-enclosed and does not have any through services with other railway lines.

On weekdays, trains run every 2 minutes 15 seconds in the morning and evening peak and every 5 minutes during the daytime. The first trains start from Shibuya and Asakusa at 05:01, and the last ones reach Shibuya at 00:37, and Asakusa at 00:39.

== History ==
The Ginza Line was conceived by a businessman named Noritsugu Hayakawa, who visited London in 1914, saw the London Underground and concluded that Tokyo needed its own underground railway. He founded the with Baron Furuichi Kōi in 1920, and began construction on September 27, 1925, after raising ¥6.2 million of the ¥35 million initially required to fund the project.

Originally, the Ginza Line was proposed to open from Shimbashi to Asakusa all at once, but because of a recession following the Great Kanto Earthquake, it became difficult to raise funds for the line. The portion between and was completed on December 30, 1927, and publicized as &quot;the first underground railway in the Orient&quot;. Upon its opening, the line was so popular that passengers often had to wait more than two hours to ride a train for a five-minute trip.

On January 1, 1930, the subway was extended by to temporary Manseibashi Station, abandoned on November 21, 1931 when the subway reached , further south down the line. The Great Depression slowed down construction, but the line finally reached its originally planned terminus of on June 21, 1934.

In 1938, the , a company tied to the predecessor of today&#x27;s Tokyu Corporation, began service between and , later extended to Shimbashi in 1939. The two lines began through-service interoperation in 1939 and were formally merged as the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (&quot;Eidan Subway&quot; or &quot;TRTA&quot;) in July 1941 in accordance with the , related to the State General Mobilization Law.

The &quot;Ginza Line&quot; name was applied in 1953 to distinguish the line from the new Marunouchi Line. In the postwar economic boom, the Ginza Line became increasingly crowded. The new Hanzōmon Line began to relieve the Ginza Line&#x27;s traffic in the 1980s, but the Ginza Line is still quite crowded as it serves major residential, commercial, and business districts in central Tokyo. According to a 2018 release of Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, the Ginza Line is the seventh most crowded subway line in Tokyo, running at 160% capacity between and stations.

Automatic train control (ATC) and train automatic stopping controller (TASC) were activated on the Ginza Line on July 31, 1993, replacing the previous mechanical automatic train stop (ATS) system. This allowed for an increase in the maximum operating speed limit from to , which came into effect on August 2, 1993, and hence enabled a corresponding increase in the line&#x27;s route capacity and train frequency. The newest station on the line, Tameike-sannō Station, opened in 1997 to provide a connection to the newly built Namboku Line.

The line, station facilities, rolling stock, and related assets were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

== Station list ==

Being the oldest line on the Tokyo Metro, stations are also the closest to the surface—generally no more than one and a half stories underground. The western end of the line enters Shibuya Station located on the third-floor of a building that is located in a depression.


==Rolling stock==

Since April 2012, the Ginza Line uses a fleet of 40 six-car Tokyo Metro 1000 series EMUs which have a maximum speed of . Each car is long and wide, with three doors on each side. They are powered by a third rail electrified at 600 V DC. Both the Ginza Line and the Marunouchi Line are the only Tokyo Metro lines to use and third rail electrification, while subsequent lines employ narrow gauge () rails and 1,500 V DC overhead power supply to accommodate through services.

Cars are stored and inspected at Shibuya Depot located after Shibuya Station and at , a facility located northeast of Ueno Station with both above-ground and underground tracks. The facility is capable of holding up to 20 6-car formations. Major inspections are carried out at Tokyo Metro&#x27;s Nakano depot on the Marunouchi Line, forwarding over a connecting track at Akasaka-Mitsuke.

Chest-high platform edge doors were introduced on the Yamanote Line platforms on 2 March 2013.

===Tobu Railway===

====Platforms====

The Tobu station has three terminating tracks served by platforms 1 to 5, arranged as shown in the diagram on the right.

Platforms 3 and 5 are normally used for disembarking passengers, although platform 5 is also used for passengers boarding the evening &quot;TJ Liner&quot; services, which require payment of a supplementary fare. From 14 June 2015, the departure melodies used when trains are about to depart from the station are to be changed to classical themes, with &quot;Allegro&quot; from &quot;Divertimento in D major, K. 136&quot; by Mozart used for platforms 1/2, &quot;Menuetto&quot; from &quot;Eine kleine Nachtmusik&quot; by Mozart used for platforms 3/4, and &quot;Allegro ma non troppo&quot; from the &quot;Pastoral Symphony&quot; by Beethoven used for &quot;TJ Liner&quot; services departing from platform 5.

Chest-high platform edge doors are scheduled to be added by the end of fiscal 2020. Platform doors protecting platform 1 are in use since 21 April 2018. It is planned to have platform doors protecting platforms 2 and 3 in operation from 2 March 2019.

====Ticket barriers====
There are three sets of ticket barriers giving access to the platforms: the &quot;South Gate&quot; at ground level (signposted in red), and the &quot;Central Gate&quot; (signposted in blue) and &quot;North Gate&quot; (signposted in green) on the first basement level.

===Seibu Railway===

Platforms 1, 4, and 6 are normally used for disembarking passengers only.

===Tokyo Metro===

====Platform====
This station consists of three separate island platforms for the Marunouchi Line, Yurakucho Line, and Fukutoshin Line.

====Station layout====


The Tokyo Metro platforms are equipped with chest-height platform edge doors.

==History==

The station was opened on 1 April 1903 by the Japanese Government Railways (JGR). The Tōjō Railway Line (present-day Tobu Tojo Line) station opened on 1 May 1914 with the opening of the line to in Saitama Prefecture (located between the present stations of Kawagoeshi and Kasumigaseki). As the Tokyo terminus of the line was originally planned to be at Shimo-Itabashi, Ikebukuro Station is to this day marked by km post &quot;-1.9&quot; (the distance from Shimo-Itabashi Station where the &quot;0 km&quot; post for the line is located).

Tobu opened a department store adjoining its station on 29 May 1962. Around the same time, the Tobu station platforms were expanded with three tracks.

In March 1992, automatic ticket barriers were installed at the north exit of the Tobu Station, and in June of the same year, the Tobu Department Store was expanded with the addition of the Metropolitan Plaza annex located on the south side.

The station facilities of the Marunouchi and Yurakucho Lines were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

In June 2008, the Tobu station ticket barriers were color-coded into three &quot;zones&quot;: North, Central, and South.

Chest-height platform edge doors were installed on the Tokyo Metro Yurakucho Line platforms in January 2011.

Station numbering was introduced to the JR platforms in 2016 with Ikebukuro being assigned station numbers JY13 for the Yamanote Line, JA12 for the Saikyo Line, and JS21 for the Shonan-Shinjuku Line.

On 1 March 2024, the departure melody on both Yamanote Line platforms was changed to the theme song of Bic Camera. The company has its head office and a major store building in the area.

==Passenger statistics==
The figures below are the official number of passengers entering and exiting each day released by each train operator.

Annual passenger figures for the station between fiscal 1903 and 1965 are as shown below. Note that the figures only consider boarding passengers and a blank indicates that no data is available.

The daily passenger figures for the JR East, Seibu, Tobu, and Tokyo Metro station after fiscal 2000 are as shown below. Note that the JR East figures only consider boarding passengers whereas the Seibu, Tobu, and Tokyo Metro figures consider both entering and exiting passengers.

==Surrounding area==
The surrounding Ikebukuro district is a major commercial center. The Seibu department store, Sunshine City, Parco, and Bic Camera are located to the east of the station, while the Tobu department store and Metropolitan Plaza are located to the west.

<text>The Teton Dam was an earthen dam in the western United States, on the Teton River in eastern Idaho. It was built by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, one of eight federal agencies authorized to construct dams. Located between Fremont and Madison counties, it suffered a catastrophic failure on June 5, 1976, as it was filling for the first time.

The collapse of Teton Dam killed 11 people and 16,000 livestock. The dam cost about $100 million to build and the federal government paid over $300 million in claims arising from its failure. Total damage estimates have ranged up to $2 billion, and the dam was not rebuilt.

==History and geology==
Interest in building a dam in the eastern Snake River Plain had arisen for many years to control spring runoff and provide a more constant water supply in the summer. The area had suffered a severe drought in 1961, followed by severe flooding in 1962. The Bureau of Reclamation proposed the Teton Dam in 1963 and Congress passed, without opposition, an authorizing bill the following year. The planned dam was to be an earthen structure high and long, creating a reservoir in length. The impounded water would be used to generate hydroelectric power. An environmental impact statement was issued for the dam in 1971, but it did not raise the possibility of a collapse. Lack of funding and site preparation work and questions surrounding the required environmental impact statement stalled the project. Barely 14 pages long, the statement quickly drew the ire of opponents of the project.

On September 27, 1971, several environmental and conservation groups filed a lawsuit in Idaho District Court to stop the construction. Opponents of the dam questioned the project&#x27;s justifications. They argued that damming a wild and scenic river would result in the destruction of its trout fishery and other wildlife habitat and &quot;replace a unique resource with a vulgar one.&quot; The suit questioned the economic return on the investment, the bureau&#x27;s compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, and the geologic soundness of the dam&#x27;s location. Concerns over the seismic conditions of the dam site delayed the bid process pending further review by the Department of the Interior. Pressure from Idaho&#x27;s congressional delegation stopped the review, and in spite of the lawsuit, bids were taken in Idaho Falls on October 29, 1971. The $39 million contract was awarded in December 1971 to Morrison-Knudsen Co. of Boise, assisted by Peter Kiewit Sons Co. of Omaha, Nebraska. In spite of the lawsuit, work began in February 1972. After various motions, amended complaints, attempted injunctions, and appeals, the suit was dismissed on December 23, 1974.

The eastern Snake River Plain is almost entirely underlain by basalt erupted from large shield volcanos on top of rhyolitic ash-flow tuff and ignimbrites. The tuff, a late-Cenozoic volcanic rock, is 1.9 million years old. The dam site is composed of basalt and rhyolite, both of which are considered unsuitable for dam construction because of their high permeability. This was confirmed by long-term pump-in tests at rates of per minute. Test cores, drilled by engineers and geologists employed by the Bureau of Reclamation, showed that the canyon rock at the dam site is highly fissured and unstable, particularly on the right side (as one faces the direction of flow). The widest fissures were determined to be wide. The bureau planned to seal these fissures by injecting grout into the rock under high pressure to create a grout curtain in the rock.

In addition, an investigation of the area by geologists of the U.S. Geologic Survey indicated that it was seismically active; five earthquakes had occurred within of the dam site in the previous five years, two of which had been of significant magnitude. This information was provided to the Bureau of Reclamation in a memorandum, but the geologists&#x27; concerns were considerably watered down in the 6-month redrafting process before the USGS sent the final version of the memo to the USBR in July 1973.

In 1973, when the dam was only half built, but almost $5 million had already been spent on the project, large, open fissures were encountered during excavation of the keyway trench near the right end of the dam, about from the canyon wall. The two largest, near-vertical fissures trended generally east–west and extended more than below the bottom of the key trench. Some of the fissures were lined with calcite, and rubble filled others. Several voids, as much as wide, were encountered below the ground surface beyond the right end of the dam and grout curtain. The largest fissures were actually caves. One of them was wide and long. Another one was wide in places and long. These were not grouted because they were beyond the keyway trench and beyond the area where the bureau had decided grouting was required. This necessitated using twice as much grouting as had been originally anticipated; the total injected grout included 496,515 ft3 of Portland cement, 82,364 ft3 of sand, 132,000 pounds of bentonite, and 418,000 pounds of calcium chloride, injected into 118,179 linear ft of drilled holes.

Later, the report of a committee of the House of Representatives, which investigated the dam&#x27;s collapse, felt that the discovery of the caves should have been sufficient for the Bureau of Reclamation to doubt its ability to fill them in with grout, but this did not happen. Even after the dam had failed, the bureau continued to insist that the grouting was appropriate.

In December 1972, concerned about the geological conditions of the Teton River Canyon, USGS geologist David Schleicher wrote about the Teton Dam while it was still under construction, &quot;A final point is that flooding in response to seismic or other failure of the dam—probably most likely at the time of highest water—would make the flood of February 1962 look like small potatoes. Since such a flood could be anticipated, we might consider a series of strategically placed motion-picture cameras to document the process.&quot;

==Filling ==
The dam was completed in November 1975 and filling the reservoir began at the standard rate of a day. However, snows were heavy that winter, and five months later, the project&#x27;s construction engineer requested permission to double the filling rate to deal with the additional spring run-off, while continuing to inspect for leaks and monitor the groundwater. A month later, though monitoring showed that groundwater was flowing a thousand times faster than had been originally anticipated, the filling rate was doubled again, to a day.

On June 3 and 4, 1976, three small springs were discovered downstream of the dam, although the water running through the leaks was clear and such leaks are not unexpected for an earthen dam. At the time, the reservoir was almost at capacity, with a maximum depth of . The only structure that had been initially prepared for releasing water was the emergency outlet works, which could carry just . The main outlet works and spillway gates were not yet in service; the gates were cordoned off by steel walls while they were being painted.

==Collapse and flood==

On Saturday, June 5, 1976, at 7:30 am MDT, a muddy leak appeared, suggesting sediment was in the water, but engineers did not believe there was a problem. By 9:30 am, the downstream face of the dam had developed a wet spot, which began to discharge water at and the embankment material began to wash out. Crews with bulldozers were sent to plug the leak, but were unsuccessful. Local media appeared at the site and at 11:15, officials told the county sheriff&#x27;s office to evacuate downstream residents. Work crews were forced to flee on foot as the widening gap, now larger than a swimming pool, swallowed their equipment. The operators of two bulldozers caught in the eroding embankment were pulled to safety with ropes.

At 11:55 am MDT (UTC−17:55), the crest of the dam sagged and collapsed into the reservoir; two minutes later, the remainder of the right-bank third of the main dam wall disintegrated. Over (many times the average flow rate of Niagara Falls) of sediment-filled water emptied through the breach into the remaining of the Teton River canyon, after which the flood spread out and shallowed on the Snake River Plain. By 8:00 pm, the reservoir had completely emptied, although over two-thirds of the dam wall remained standing.

== Cause ==
Study of the dam&#x27;s environment and structure placed blame for the collapse on the permeable loess soil used in the core and on fissured (cracked) rhyolite in the abutments of the dam that allowed water to seep around and through the earth-fill dam. The permeable loess was found to be cracked. The combination of these flaws is thought to have allowed water to seep through the dam and to lead to internal erosion, called piping, that eventually caused the dam&#x27;s collapse.

An investigating panel had quickly identified piping as the most probable cause of the failure, then focused its efforts on determining how the piping started. Two mechanisms were possible. The first was the flow of water under highly erodible and unprotected fill, through joints in unsealed rock beneath the grout cap and development of an erosion tunnel. The second was &quot;cracking caused by differential strains or hydraulic fracturing of the core material.&quot; The panel was unable to determine whether one or the other mechanism occurred, or a combination:

The fundamental cause of failure may be regarded as a combination of geological factors and design decisions that, taken together, permitted the failure to develop.

A wide-ranging controversy ensued from the dam&#x27;s collapse. According to the Bureau of Reclamation, bureau engineers assess all reclamation dams under strict criteria established by the Safety of Dams program. Each structure is periodically reviewed for resistance to seismic activity, for internal faults, and for physical deterioration. The dam safety program identified two other dangerous dams – Fontenelle, which very nearly failed 11 years earlier, when it was filled, in a manner similar to the Teton Dam, and again in May 1985; and the Jackson Lake Dam, which would have failed during an earthquake on the nearby Teton Fault.

==Deaths, damage, and property claims==

Teton Canyon ends about below the dam site, where the river flows onto the Snake River Plain. When the dam failed, the flood struck several communities immediately downstream, particularly Wilford at the terminus of the canyon, Sugar City, Salem, Hibbard, and Rexburg. Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed. The small agricultural communities of Wilford and Sugar City were wiped from the river bank. Five of the 11 deaths attributed to the flood occurred in Wilford. The similar community of Teton, on the south bank of the river, is on a modest bench and was largely spared. One Teton resident was fishing on the river at the time of the dam failure and was drowned. An elderly woman living in the city of Teton died as a result of the evacuation.

An estimated 80% of existing structures were damaged in the Hibbard and Rexburg area, whose population was about 10,000. The Teton River flows through the industrial, commercial, and residential districts of north Rexburg. Much of the damage in the area was done by thousands of logs dislodged from a lumber yard. Dozens of them hit a bulk gasoline-storage tank a few hundred yards away. The gasoline ignited and sent flaming slicks adrift on the racing water. The force of the logs and cut lumber and the subsequent fires practically destroyed the town.

The flood waters traveled west along the route of the Henrys Fork of the Snake River, around both sides of the Menan Buttes, damaging the community of Roberts. The city of Idaho Falls, even further down on the flood plain, had time to prepare. At the older American Falls Dam downstream, engineers increased discharge by less than 5% before the flood arrived. That dam held and the flood was effectively over, but tens of thousands of acres of land near the river were stripped of fertile topsoil.

The force of the failure destroyed the lower part of the Teton River, washing away riparian zones and reducing the canyon walls. This damaged the stream&#x27;s ecology and hurt the native Yellowstone cutthroat trout population. The force of the water and excessive sediment also damaged stream habitat in the Snake River and some tributaries, as far downstream as the Fort Hall bottoms.

Debris clean-up began immediately and took the remainder of the summer. Rebuilding of damaged property continued for several years. Within a week of the disaster, President Gerald Ford requested a $200 million appropriation for initial payments for damages, without assigning responsibility for Teton Dam&#x27;s failure.

The Bureau of Reclamation set up claims offices in Rexburg, Idaho Falls, and Blackfoot. By January 4, 1977, seven months after the disaster, victims had filed over 4,800 claims totaling $194 million and the federal government had paid 3,813 of those claims worth $93.5 million. The claims program was originally scheduled to end in July 1978, but continued until January 1987, when the federal government had paid 7,563 claims for a total amount of $322 million.

No plans have been made for rebuilding the Teton Dam, but its reconstruction has been discussed over the years.

<doc id="390160" wikidata="Q428811" url="?curid=390160" title="Shibuya Station">
<text>is a major railway station in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), Keio Corporation, Tokyu Corporation, and Tokyo Metro. It serves as a terminal for six railway lines, five of which are operated by Tokyo Metro and Tokyu Corporation.

The railway was recorded to cater an average of 2.4 million passengers on a weekday in 2004. It was considered as the fourth-busiest commuter rail station in Japan and the world (after Shinjuku, Ikebukuro, and Ōsaka / Umeda). It handles a large population of commuter traffic between the city center and suburbs to the south and west.

==Lines==

===JR East===
* Saikyō Line / Shōnan–Shinjuku Line (Yamanote Freight Line) - also used by &quot;Narita Express&quot; trains
* Yamanote Line

===Private railways===
* Keio Inokashira Line - terminus
* - through service with Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line
* - through service with Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line

===Subways===
* - terminus
* - through service with Tokyu Den-en-toshi Line
* - through service with Tokyu Tōyoko Line

Note that while the Tokyo Metro Hanzōmon Line and Fukutoshin Line are directly connected to each other (and passengers can switch from one to another without passing through ticket gates), the Ginza Line station is a standalone terminal. Transfers to the Fukutoshin/Tōyoko Line are given 60 min to do so outside the fare control area, but those needing to transfer to Hanzōmon/Den-en-toshi Line should transfer at the Omotesando station instead.

==Station layout==

In 2013 and 2014, Shibuya station underwent major renovations as a part of a long-term site redevelopment plan. While all rail and subway lines continued to operate, some station exits and entrances were changed for improvement. As of March 2013, the east side of the main station was transformed due to the provision of through train services between the Tokyu Toyoko Line and the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line. While much of the main station building, previously housing the Tokyu department store, had been closed and was set for demolition, the west building of the Tokyu department store continued to operate as before. The Shibuya Hikarie building, also owned by the Tokyu Group, opened in 2012 and contains department store retail, restaurants, and offices.

The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, originally built and operated by a Tokyu keiretsu company, continues to use platforms on the third floor of the station building. The JR lines are on the second floor in a north-south orientation. The Tokyu Toyoko Line originally used parallel platforms on the second floor of the same building, but effective on 16 March 2013, the Toyoko Line moved underground to provide rail service with the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line. The Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line and Tokyu Den-en-Toshi Line share platforms underground in another part of the station. The Keio Inokashira Line uses platforms on the second floor of the Shibuya Mark City building to the west of the main station complex.

The main JR/Tokyu/Tokyo Metro complex has six exits. The northwest , named for the nearby statue of the dog Hachikō and located next to Shibuya&#x27;s famous scramble crossing, is a particularly popular meeting spot. The on the west side leads to the Keiō Inokashira Line Shibuya Station platforms.

On , a mural by Tarō Okamoto, &quot;The Myth of Tomorrow&quot;, depicting a human figure being hit by an atomic bomb, was unveiled in its new permanent location at the station, in the connecting passage to the Keio Inokashira Line entrance.

===JR East===
====Platforms====
There are two island platforms with a total of four tracks. One of the platforms serves the Yamanote Line and the other serves the Saikyō Line and Shōnan–Shinjuku Line.

The station was opened in 1885 with one island platform serving what is now the Yamanote Line. To alleviate congestion, a second side platform was opened to the west in July 1940 and the original platform was converted to a side platform. In March 1996, the first Saikyō Line platform was opened. It was located to the south of the Yamanote Line platforms, approximately away. This platform was relocated to its current location during 30–31 May 2020. The original Yamanote Line platform was then widened during 23–24 October 2021. It was widened further during 7–8 January 2023, when the west side platform was removed from service and both directions of the Yamanote Line were recombined into a single island platform.



===Tokyo Metro/Tokyu===
====Tokyu Den-en-toshi Line and Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line====
=====Platforms=====
On the third basement (B3F) level, a single underground island platform serves two tracks.


====Tokyu Toyoko Line and Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line====
=====Platforms=====
Two underground island platforms on the fifth basement (B5F) level serve four tracks. Tokyu has been managing the station since the opening of the Fukutoshin Line in 2008, and the Toyoko Line uses platforms 3 and 4 since the start of through services with the two lines on 16 March 2013.


====Tokyo Metro Ginza Line====
=====Platforms=====
As of January 2020, one island platform serves two tracks. Until December 2019, two side platforms each served one track, with one platform for terminating services and one for services departing towards Asakusa.

Due to the distance between Ginza and Hanzomon Line platforms, transfer information was announced at Omote-sando Station instead.



===Keio Inokashira Line===
====Platforms====
The Keio station consists of two bay platforms serving two tracks.

==History==
On 1 March 1885, Shibuya Station first opened as a stop on the Shinagawa Line, a predecessor of the present-day Yamanote Line. The station was later expanded to accommodate the Tamagawa Railway (1907; closed 1969), the Toyoko Line (1927), and the Teito Shibuya Line (1 August 1933; now the Inokashira Line).

Between 1925 and 1935, the legendary Akita dog named Hachikō waited for his deceased owner, appearing at the station right when his train was due for nine years.

In 1938, the station added platforms for the Tōkyō Rapid Railway, which began through service with the Ginza Line in 1939 and formally merged with it in 1941.

In 1946, the infamous Shibuya incident, a gang fight involving hundreds of people, occurred in front of the station.

More recently, the Den-en-toshi Line (1977), the Hanzōmon Line (1978), and the Fukutoshin Line (2008) began serving the station. Between December 2008 and March 2009, piezoelectric mats were installed at Shibuya Station as a small scale test.

From 22 February 2013, station numbering was introduced on Keio lines, with Shibuya Station becoming &quot;IN01&quot;.

Station numbering was later introduced to the JR East platforms in 2016 with Shibuya being assigned station numbers JS19 for the Shonan-Shinjuku line, JA10 for the Saikyo line, and JY20 for the Yamanote Line. At the same time, JR East assigned its major transfer stations a 3-letter code; Shibuya was assigned the code &quot;SBY&quot;.

On 3 January 2020, the Ginza Line platforms were shifted about east of the old platforms.

On 1 June 2020, the Saikyo Line platforms were shifted about north of the old platforms, and now sits right next to the Yamanote Line platforms.

Major widening work took place on the Yamanote Line inner circle platform (Platform 2) on 23–24 October 2021. As a result, Yamanote Line service was suspended between Ikebukuro and Osaki. To accommodate for delays, an additional special train service was run between Shinagawa and Shinjuku by way of the Yamanote Freight Line.

Effective the timetable revision on 18 March 2023, through services onto the Sagami Railway commenced courtesy of the Tokyu and Sotetsu Shin-yokohama Line. Most southbound services routing through Hiyoshi on the Tokyu Shin-yokohama Line continue as far south as Shōnandai Station on the Sōtetsu Izumino Line.
===Former Toyoko Line station===

The former above-ground Tokyu Toyoko Line terminal station platforms were taken out of use after the last train service on 15 March 2013. From the start of the revised timetable on 16 March 2013, Toyoko Line services used the underground platforms 3-4 shared with Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line services.

====Platforms====
The station had four 8-car long bay platforms numbered 1 to 4, serving four tracks.

==Future developments==
JR East is in the process of rebuilding the station, with reconstruction work starting in earnest in fiscal year 2015.

On the platform of the Toyoko Line, which was moved to the east side of the station, Tokyu Corporation constructed a high, 47-story commercial building &quot;Shibuya Scramble Square&quot;, which became the tallest building in Shibuya when it opened in November 2019. Several commercial buildings connected to the station will be constructed by 2027.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal year 2013, the JR East station was used by 378,539 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the fifth-busiest JR East station. Over the same fiscal year, the Keio station was used by an average of 336,957 passengers daily (exiting and entering passengers), making it the busiest station on the Inokashira Line. In fiscal 2013, the Tokyo Metro Ginza station was used by an average of 212,136 passengers daily and the Tokyo Metro Hanzōmon and Fukutoshin stations were used by an average of 731,184 passengers daily. Note that the latter statistics consider passengers who travel through Shibuya station on a through service as users of the station, even if they did not disembark at the station. In fiscal 2013, the Tokyu Toyoko Line station was used by an average of 441,266 passengers daily and the Den-en-toshi Line station was used by an average of 665,645 passengers daily. The daily passenger figures for each operator in previous years are as shown below.
* Note that JR East figures are for boarding passengers only.
* Note that the Tokyo Metro figures are for the Ginza Line station only.

==Surrounding area==

Surrounding the station is the commercial center of Shibuya. The Tokyu Department Store is connected to the east gate of the station and several other department stores are within walking distance.
* Shibuya Ward Office
* NHK Broadcasting Center
* NHK Hall
* Shibuya Mark City
* Shibuya 109
* Shibuya Hikarie
* Yoyogi Park
* Miyashita Park

The Shibuya River flows directly under the station, to the east and parallel to the JR tracks. Unlike most other Japanese department stores, the east block of Tokyu Department Store closed in 2013, and due for demolition as a part of the Shibuya Station redevelopment plan, did not have basement retail space due to the river passing directly underneath. An escalator in the east block of the store was constructed over the river stops a few steps above floor level to make space for machinery underneath without the need for further excavation. Rivers are deemed public space under Japanese law, so building over one is normally illegal. It is not clear why this was allowed when the store buildings were first constructed in 1933.

== Cultural References ==
Various parts of the station also feature in the manga/anime television series Jujutsu Kaisen as the setting for what is dubbed the Shibuya Incident.

<text>The Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM) is an American nonprofit organization, founded in 1965 in Chicago by pianist Muhal Richard Abrams, pianist Jodie Christian, drummer Steve McCall, and composer Phil Cohran. The AACM is devoted &quot;to nurturing, performing, and recording serious, original music,&quot; according to its charter. It supports and encourages jazz performers, composers and educators. Although founded in the jazz tradition, the group&#x27;s outreach and influence has, according to Larry Blumenfeld, &quot;touched nearly all corners of modern music.&quot;

==Background==
By the 1960s, jazz music was losing ground to rock music, and the founders of the AACM felt that a proactive group of musicians would add creativity and outlet for new music. The AACM was formed in May 1965 by a group of musicians centered on pianist Muhal Richard Abrams, who had organized the Experimental Band since 1961. The musicians were generally steadfast in their commitment to their music, despite a lack of performance venues and sometimes indifferent audiences. From 1969 the AACM organised a music education program for inner-city youths. In the 1960s and 1970s AACM members were among the most important and innovative in all of jazz, though the AACM&#x27;s contemporary influence has waned some in recent years. Many AACM members have recorded widely: in the early days on the Delmark Records Avant Garde Jazz series and later on the Black Saint/Soul Note and India Navigation labels, and to a lesser extent on the Arista Records and ECM labels.

The musical endeavors of members of the AACM often include an adventurous mixing of avant-garde jazz, classical, and world music. The AACM also ran a school, The AACM School of Music, with classes in all areas taught by members of the AACM. The AACM also had a strong relationship with an influential sister organization, the Black Artists Group (BAG) of St. Louis, Missouri. The AACM has received aid from the MacArthur Foundation and has a strong relationship with Columbia College. &quot;A Power Stronger Than Itself: The AACM and American Experimental Music&quot; by George E. Lewis, has been published by the University of Chicago Press (May 2008).

In 2015, a 50-year retrospective exhibition of art, music and group-related artifacts, entitled, &quot;Free at First&quot;, was held at the DuSable Museum of African American History.

==Music==
The AACM has been on the forefront of the avant-garde since its inception in 1965. Anthony Braxton, Henry Threadgill, and the Art Ensemble of Chicago pushed the boundaries of jazz and challenged the avant-garde classical movement led by John Cage. Concerts were heavily improvised, and many AACM members created scores that blended music, geometry, painting, and ciphers to be interpreted by the performers live. The AACM was part of an artistic movement on the South Side of Chicago that included AFRICobra (African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists) and other collectives.

<doc id="390163" wikidata="Q1197028" url="?curid=390163" title="Keihin–Tōhoku Line">
<text>The is a railway line in Japan which connects the cities of Saitama, Kawaguchi, Tokyo, Kawasaki, and Yokohama. It is part of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) network. The line&#x27;s name is derived from the characters for Tokyo (), Yokohama () and the Tōhoku Main Line (). The line runs parallel with the Tōkaidō Main Line between Yokohama and Tokyo and the Utsunomiya Line (part of the Tōhoku Main Line) except between Ueno and Akabane stations where the two lines are physically separate and thus alternate routes.

Most Keihin–Tōhoku Line trains have a through service onto the Negishi Line between Yokohama and Ōfuna stations. As a result, the entire service between Ōmiya and Ōfuna is typically referred to as the Keihin-Tōhoku–Negishi Line () on system maps and in-train station guides. Keihin–Tōhoku–Negishi Line trains are recognizable by their light blue stripe (the line&#x27;s color on maps is also light blue).

==Service outline==
Trains run every 2–3 minutes at peak hours, every 5-6 minutes during the daytime, and less frequently the rest of the time. In general, these trains are classified as , stopping at all stations en route. However, all trains in the daytime (10:30-15:30) are classified as . These rapid trains skip some stations in central Tokyo, where the Keihin-Tōhoku Line runs parallel to the Yamanote Line.

==Station list==
* Local trains stop at all stations. Rapid trains stop at stations marked &quot;●&quot; and &quot;■&quot;. (Stations marked &quot;■&quot; allow cross-platform transfers to the Yamanote Line). Additionally, stations marked &quot;▲&quot; are served by rapid trains on weekends and national holidays only.

===Keihin–Tōhoku Line===
==Rolling stock==

As of January 2010, all Keihin-Tohoku Line services are formed of E233-1000 series 10-car electrical multiple unit (EMU) trains. These were phased in from December 2007, and replaced the previous 209 series 10-car EMUs by 24 January 2010. All Keihin-Tohoku Line rolling stock is based at Urawa Depot. Yokohama Line E233-6000 series 8-car EMUs also operate on through services over the Keihin-Tohoku Line between Higashi-Kanagawa and Ofuna stations.

===Timeline===
==History==

The line opened on 20 December 1914 as an electrified passenger line connecting Shinagawa Station in Tokyo with Takashimacho Station in Yokohama. (The latter station was renamed Yokohama Station in August 1915, when the former Yokohama Station was renamed Sakuragicho Station). It was originally called the Tokaido Electric Line () and was subsequently renamed to the Keihin Line (). From 30 December 1915, services were extended south to the new Sakuragicho Station.

The Keihin Line service was extended north via the Tohoku Main Line to Akabane Station in February 1928, and to Ōmiya Station in September 1932.

The Keihin Line initially had third-class and second-class cars, analogous to today&#x27;s ordinary cars and Green Cars respectively. Second-class service ended in 1938 in order to accommodate special military cars during the World War II. The military seating was converted to seating for women and children after the war, and back to ordinary seating in 1973 amid overcrowding concerns: second-class service was briefly restored in the 1950s but abandoned shortly thereafter.
From November 1956, the Keihin-Tohoku Line was physically separated from the Yamanote Line between Tamachi and Tabata, allowing more frequent service. Through service with the Negishi Line began on 19 May 1964. 10-car trains (103 series) began operating from 1 April 1966.

Limited-stop &quot;Rapid&quot; services were introduced in 1988 to further ease congestion along the Yamanote Line corridor. From 14 March 2015, all rapid services began serving Kanda Station. Additionally, rapid services began serving Okachimachi Station on weekends and national holidays only.

On 20 August 2016, station numbering was introduced with stations being assigned station numbers between JK12 and JK47. Numbers increase towards in the northbound direction towards Omiya.

A new station, the Takanawa Gateway Station, opened on 14 March 2020, in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics to be held in Tokyo. The station is located on the Yamanote Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line between and stations. The distance between Shinagawa and Tamachi stations was . Takanawa Gateway was constructed on top of the 20-hectare former railyard, which is undergoing rationalization and redevelopment by JR East. The Yamanote Line and the Keihin Tohoku Line tracks were moved slightly to the east to be aligned closer to the Tokaido Shinkansen tracks. The area on the west side of the yard made available will be redeveloped with high-rise office buildings, creating an international business center with connections to the Shinkansen and Haneda Airport.

==Accidents==
At around 01:11 in the morning of 23 February 2014, an empty stock train operating from Sakuragicho to Kamata hit a track maintenance vehicle on the track close to Kawasaki Station. The first two cars of the 10-car E233 series train derailed, with the first car ending up on its side. The train was carrying no passengers, and the driver and conductor escaped with minor injuries.

<doc id="390164" wikidata="Q335533" url="?curid=390164" title="Adolfo López Mateos">
<text>Adolfo López Mateos (; 26 May 1909 – 22 September 1969) was a Mexican politician who served as President of Mexico from 1958 to 1964. Previously, he served as Secretary of Labor and Social Welfare from 1952 to 1957 and a Senator from the State of Mexico from 1946 to 1952.

Beginning his political career as a campaign aide of José Vasconcelos during his run for president, López Mateos encountered repression from Plutarco Elías Calles, who attempted to maintain hegemony within the National Revolutionary Party (PNR). He briefly abandoned politics and worked as a professor at the Autonomous University of Mexico State, becoming a member of the PNR (renamed Party of the Mexican Revolution) in 1941. López Mateos served as senator for the State of Mexico from 1946 to 1952 and Secretary of Labor during the administration of Adolfo Ruiz Cortines from 1952 to 1957. He secured the party&#x27;s presidential nomination and won in the 1958 general election.

Declaring his political philosophy to be &quot;left within the Constitution&quot;, López Mateos was the first self-declared left-wing politician to hold the presidency since Lázaro Cárdenas. His administration created the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers, the National Commission for Free Textbooks and the National Museum of Anthropology. An advocate of non-intervention, he settled the Chamizal dispute with the United States and led the nationalization of the Mexican electrical industry during a period of economic boom and low inflation known as &quot;Desarrollo Estabilizador&quot;.

There were also acts of repression during his administration, such as the arrest of union leaders Demetrio Vallejo and Valentín Campa, and the murder of peasant leader Rubén Jaramillo by the Mexican Army. López Mateos engaged with revolutionary Marcos Ignacio Infante, leader of the Zapatista Movement (Political ally of John F. Kennedy). Shortly before the killing of Jaramillo, Infante would visit the UN Demanding President López Mateos to step down or face a revolution. Infante attacked an Army Post outside of Mexico City, with over 300 men in 1962.

López Mateos has been praised for his policies including land redistribution, energy nationalization, and health and education programs, but has also been criticized for his repressive actions against labor unions and political opponents. Along with Cárdenas and Ruiz Cortines, he is usually ranked as one of the most popular Mexican presidents of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Adolfo López Mateos was born on 26 May 1909, according to official records, in Atizapán de Zaragoza – a small town in the State of Mexico, now called Ciudad López Mateos – to Mariano Gerardo López y Sánchez Roman, a dentist, and Elena Mateos y Vega, a teacher. His family moved to Mexico City upon his father&#x27;s death when López Mateos was still young. However, there exists a birth certificate and several testimonies archived at El Colegio de México that place his birth on 10 September 1909, in Patzicía, Guatemala.

In 1929, he graduated from the Scientific and Literary Institute of Toluca, where he was a delegate and student leader of the anti-re-electionist campaign of former Minister of Education José Vasconcelos, who ran in opposition to Pascual Ortiz Rubio, handpicked by former President Plutarco Elías Calles. Calles had founded the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR) in the wake of the assassination of President-elect Alvaro Obregón. After Vasconcelos&#x27;s defeat, López Mateos attended law school at National Autonomous University of Mexico and shifted his political allegiance to the PNR.

==Career==
===Political career===
Early in his career, he served as the private secretary to Col. Filiberto Gómez, the governor of the state of Mexico. In 1934, he became the private secretary of the president of the Partido Nacional Revolucionario (PNR), Carlos Riva Palacio.

He filled a number of bureaucratic positions until 1941, when he met Isidro Fabela. Fabela helped him into a position as the director of the Literary Institute of Toluca after Fabela resigned the post to join the International Court of Justice. López Mateos became a senator of the state of Mexico in 1946, while at the same time serving as Secretary General of the PRI. He organized the presidential campaign of PRI candidate Adolfo Ruiz Cortines and was subsequently appointed Secretary of Labor in his new cabinet. He did an exemplary job, and for the first and only time, a Secretary of Labor was tapped to be the PRI&#x27;s candidate for the presidency. As the candidate for the dominant party with only weak opposition, López Mateos easily won election, serving as president until 1964.

==Presidency (1958–1964)==
López Mateos assumed the presidency on December 1, 1958. As president of Mexico, along with his predecessor, Ruiz Cortines (1952–1958), López Mateos continued the outline of policies by President Miguel Alemán (1946–1952), who set Mexico&#x27;s postwar strategy. Alemán favored industrialization and the interests of capital over labor. All three were heirs to the legacy of the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920), but Alemán Valdés and López Mateos were too young to have participated directly. In the sphere of foreign policy, López Mateos charted a course of independence from the U.S. but cooperated on some issues despite his opposition to the hostile U.S. policy toward the 1959 Cuban Revolution.

===Domestic policy===
====Labor====
López Mateos sought the continuation of industrial growth in Mexico, often characterized as the Mexican Miracle, but it required the cooperation of organized labor. Organized labor was increasingly restive. It was a sector of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and controlled through the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), led by Fidel Velázquez. Increasingly, however, unions pushed back against government control and sought gains in wages, working conditions, and more independence from so-called &quot;charro&quot; union leaders, who followed government and party dictates. López Mateos had mainly success when he served as his predecessor&#x27;s Secretary of Labor, but as president, he was faced with major labor unrest. The previous strategy of playing off one labor organization against another, such as the CTM, the Revolutionary Confederation of Workers and Peasants (CROC), and the General Union of Workers and Peasants of Mexico (UGOCM), ceased to work.

In July 1958, the militant railway workers&#x27; union, under the leadership of Demetrio Vallejo and Valentín Campa, began a series of strikes for better wages, which culminated in a major strike during Holy Week 1959. The Easter holiday was when many Mexicans traveled by train and so the choice of the date was designed for maximum impact on the general public. López Mateos depended on the forceful cabinet minister Gustavo Díaz Ordaz to deal with the striking railway workers. The government arrested all of the leaders of the union and filled Lecumberri Penitentiary. Valentín Campa and Demetrio Vallejo were given lengthy prison sentences for violating Article 145 of the Mexican Constitution for the crime of &quot;social dissolution.&quot; The article empowered the government to imprison &quot;whomever it decided to consider an enemy of Mexico.&quot; Also imprisoned for that crime was the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, who remained in Lecumberri Penitentiary until the end of López Mateos&#x27;s presidential term. López Mateos depended on Díaz Ordaz as the enforcer of political and labor peace to allow president to attend to other matters. &quot;Throughout the years of López Mateos, in every situation of conflict, Díaz Ordaz was directly involved.&quot;

The government attempted to reduce labor unrest by setting up a National Commission for the Implementation of Profit Sharing which apportioned between 5% and 10% of each company&#x27;s profits to organized labor. In 1960, Article 123 of the Constitution of 1917 was amended. There were guarantees written into the constitution concerning salaries, paid holidays, vacations, overtime, and bonuses to government civil servants. However, government workers were required to join the Federation of Union Workers in Service to the State (FSTSE) and forbidden to join any other union. Tight price controls and sharp increases in the minimum wage also ensured that the workers&#x27; real minimum wage index reached its highest level since the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas.

====Conflict with Lázaro Cárdenas====
Although Cárdenas had set a precedent for the ex-president to turn over complete government control to his successor, he re-emerged from political retirement to push the López Mateos government more toward leftist stances. The January 1959 taking of power by Fidel Castro gave Latin America another example of revolution. Cárdenas went to Cuba in July 1959 and was with Castro at a huge rally at which Castro declared himself to be prime minister of Cuba. Cárdenas returned to Mexico with the hope that the ideals of the Mexican Revolution could be revived, with land reform, support for agriculture, and an expansion of education and health services to Mexicans. He also directly appealed to López Mateos to free jailed union leaders. López Mateos became increasingly hostile to Cárdenas, who was explicitly and implicitly rebuking him. To Cárdenas he said, &quot;They say the Communists are weaving a dangerous web around you.&quot; Cárdenas oversaw the creation of a new pressure group, the National Liberation Movement (MLN), composed of a wide variety of leftists, which participants considered a way to defend the Mexican Revolution was to defend the Cuban Revolution.

López Mateos found a way to counter Cárdenas&#x27;s criticisms, by emulating his policies. The president nationalized the electric industry in 1960. It was not as dramatic an event as Cárdenas&#x27;s expropriation of the oil industry in 1938, but it was nonetheless economic nationalism and the government could claim it as a victory for Mexico. Other reformist policies of his presidency can be seen as ways to counter the left&#x27;s criticism, such as land reform, education reform, and social programs to alleviate poverty in Mexico. Cárdenas came back into the political fold of the PRI, when he supported López Mateos&#x27;s choice for his successor in 1964, his enforcer, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz.

====Land reform====
A wide range of social reforms were carried out during his presidency. Land reform was implemented vigorously, with 16 million hectares of land redistributed. It was the most significant amount of land distributed since the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas. The government also sought to improve the lives of &quot;ejidatarios&quot;. The government expropriated land that had been owned by U.S. interests in the extreme south, which helped to reduce land tension in that part of the country.

====Public health and social welfare programs====
Public health campaigns were also launched to combat diseases such as polio, malaria, and tuberculosis. Typhus, smallpox, and yellow fever were eradicated, and malaria was significantly reduced.

Tackling poverty became one of the priorities of his government, and social welfare spending reached a historical peak of 19.2% of total spending. A number of social welfare programs for the poor were set up, and the existing social-welfare programs were improved. Health care and pensions were increased, new hospitals and clinics were built, and the IMSS programme for rural Mexico was expanded. A social security institute was established, the &quot;Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores al Servicio del Estado&quot; (ISSSTE), to provide childcare, medical services, and other social services to workers, especially state employees. A 1959 amendment to the Social Security Law also brought part-time workers within the auspices of social security. He established the National Institute for the Protection of Children to provide medical services and other aid to children.
A food distribution system was established to provide affordable staples for poor Mexicans and a market for farm produce. The government entered the housing business on a large scale for the first time in Mexican history, with a major program being initiated to build low-cost housing in major industrial cities, with over 50,000 units of low-income housing constructed between 1958 and 1964. One of the largest housing developments in Mexico City housed 100,000 people and contained several nurseries, four clinics, and several schools.

====Museums and historical memory====

López Mateos opened a number of major museums during his presidency, the most spectacular of which was the National Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park. Also opened in Chapultepec Park was the Museum of Modern Art. His Minister of Education Jaime Torres Bodet had played a major role in realizing the projects. Works from the colonial era were moved from the Historic Center of Mexico City to north of the capital in the former Jesuit colegio in Tepozotlan, creating the Museo del Virreinato. The Historical Museum of Mexico City was situated in Mexico City.

====Educational reform====
In an effort to reduce illiteracy, the idea of adult education classes was revived, and a system of free and compulsory school textbooks was launched. In 1959, the National Commission of Free Textbooks (&quot;Comisión Nacional de Libros de Textos Gratuitos&quot;) was created. The textbook program was controversial since the content would be created by the government, and the textbooks&#x27; use would be obligatory in schools. It was opposed by the &quot;Unión Nacional de Padres de Familia&quot;, a conservative organization, and the Roman Catholic Church, which also saw education as a private family matter. Education had become the largest single item in the federal budget by 1963, and there was a renewed emphasis on school construction. Almost every village was assisted in the construction of schools and provided with teachers and textbooks. Free student breakfasts for primary-school pupils were also restored.

====Student activism====
Increasingly, students were becoming politically engaged beyond the limited demands that affected them personally. The triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959 captured leftist students&#x27; imagination. However, the government&#x27;s repression of union and peasant activists was soon replicated against students. Students at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) became more politicized, and their participation in demonstrations was met with government repression. The scale of the phenomenon would become much larger later in the 1960s, when Díaz Ordaz became president, but the early 1960s marked the beginnings of the antagonism.

====Electoral reform====
An attempt was made at political liberalization, with an amendment to the constitution that altered the electoral procedures in the Chamber of Deputies by encouraging greater representation for opposition candidates in Congress. The electoral reform of 1963 introduced so-called &quot;party deputies&quot; (&quot;diputados del partido&quot;) in which opposition parties were granted five seats in the Chamber of Deputies if they received at least 2.5 percent of the national vote and one more seat for each additional 0.5 percent (up to 20 party deputies). In the 1964 elections, for instance, the Popular Socialist Party (PPS) won 10 seats, and the National Action Party (PAN) won 20. By giving opposition political parties a greater voice in government, the country, controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, had the appearance and greater legitimacy as a democracy.

====Armed forces====
The army was the enforcer of government policy and intervened to break strikes. López Mateos created more social security benefits for the military in 1961. The army had been incorporated as a sector into the Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM) under Lázaro Cárdenas, and when the Institutional Revolutionary Party was formed in 1946, the army was no longer sector, but remained loyal to the government and enforced order. During the presidency of López Mateos, the peasant leader Rubén Jaramillo, an ideological heir to peasant revolutionary Emiliano Zapata was murdered along with his family in 1962, &quot;apparently at the instigation or with the foreknowledge of General Gómez Huerta, chief of the Presidential General Staff&quot; under the president&#x27;s personal command. Young writer and intellectual, Carlos Fuentes wrote a report of the murder for the magazine &quot;Siempre!&quot;, recording for an urban readership the grief of the peasant residents of Jojutla. The use of the army against a government opponent and the concern of a young urban intellectual about such an act being committed in his name were indicators marking a change in the political climate in Mexico.

===Foreign policy===
An important position for López Mateos&#x27;s foreign policy was its stance on the Cuban Revolution. As Cuba moved leftward, the U.S. pressured all Latin America to join it to isolate Cuba, but Mexican foreign policy was to respect Cuba&#x27;s independence. The U.S. had imposed an economic blockade on Cuba and organized Cuba&#x27;s expulsion from the Organization of American States (OAS). Mexico took on principle the &quot;nonintervention in the internal affairs of countries&quot; and the &quot;respect for the self-determination of nations.&quot; However, Mexico supported some U.S. foreign policy positions, such as barring China, as opposed to Taiwan, from holding a seat in the United Nations. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, when the Soviet Union placed missiles on Cuban territory, Mexico voted in favor of an OAS resolution for the removal of the weapons, but it also called for a ban on invading Cuba. Mexico supported Cuba&#x27;s sovereignty but had its government begun a crackdown on demonstrations at home in solidarity with Cuba, which begun fomenting revolutionary movements abroad in Latin America and Africa, and Mexico could potentially have been fertile ground. Recently released documentation shows that Mexico&#x27;s stance toward Cuba allowed it to claim solidarity with another Latin American revolution and raise its profile in the Western Hemisphere with other Latin American countries, but its overall support for revolution was weak for fear of destabilization at home.

López Mateos welcomed U.S. President John F. Kennedy to Mexico for a highly-successful visit in July 1962 although Mexico&#x27;s relationship with Cuba differed from what U.S. policy sought. Mexico&#x27;s firm stance on Cuba&#x27;s independence despite U.S. pressure meant that Mexico had bargaining power with the U.S., which did not want to alienate Mexico, both of which had a long land border. At that juncture, the Chamizal conflict with the U.S. was resolved and a majority of the Chamizal area was granted to Mexico. Negotiations led to the successful conclusion of the Chamizal dispute, which had festered since the aftermath of the mid-19th-century Mexican–American War, a success for the López Mateos government.

==Later life==

In the last year of his presidency, López Mateos was visibly unwell. He looked worn-out and increasingly thin. On his very last months as president, a friend, Víctor Manuel Villegas, went to see him and later remembers asking him how he was; he replied that he was &quot;screwed up.&quot; It turned out that López Mateos had seven aneurysms.

After finishing his presidential term, he briefly served as head of the Olympic Committee, responsible for the organization of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico and called the meeting that led to the creation of the World Boxing Council. He had to resign because of failing health. Manuel Velasco Suárez quoted him as saying, &quot;In every way, life has smiled at me. Now I must accept whatever may come.&quot;

He eventually became unable to walk, and after an emergency tracheotomy, he lost his voice. Enrique Krauze exclaimed in one of his books, &quot;Gone was the voice of a once great orator.&quot;

Plagued with migraines during his adult life, he was diagnosed with several cerebral aneurysms, and after several years in a coma, he died in Mexico City 1969 of an aneurysm.
 His wife, Eva Sámano, was buried next to him, in the Panteón Jardín in Mexico City, after her death in 1984.

==Postmortem exile==
When Carlos Salinas de Gortari became president of Mexico (1988-1994), he had the remains of López Mateos and his wife exhumed and moved to López Mateos&#x27;s birthplace in Mexico State. A monument to the late president was erected there. This unusual step was likely due to Salinas&#x27; family animus toward López Mateos. Salinas&#x27;s father Raúl Salinas Lozano had been a cabinet minister in López Mateos&#x27;s government and was passed over for the party nomination to be the next president of Mexico. The town is now formally named Ciudad López Mateos.

<doc id="390165" wikidata="Q801436" url="?curid=390165" title="Shimbashi Station">
<text>is a major interchange railway station in Tokyo&#x27;s Minato Ward, located centrally and a 10-minute walk from the Ginza shopping district, directly south of Tokyo station.

Many train services such as limited express trains (except the Shōnan (train) service) and the JR East Keihin-Tōhoku Line rapid trains do not stop at this station.

==Station layout==
===JR East===
The JR East station consists of three surface platforms serving the Tōkaidō, Yamanote, and Keihin-Tōhoku lines, and an underground platform serving the Yokosuka Line.

====Surface platforms====


====Underground platform====


===Tokyo Metro===
Tokyo Metro operates in an underground station with two side platforms serving the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line.


===Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei)===
Toei operates in an underground station with two side platforms serving the Toei Asakusa Line.


===Yurikamome===
The terminus for the Yurikamome is an elevated station next to the JR station.

==History==

Shimbashi is the original terminus of Japan&#x27;s first stretch of railway, the Tōkaidō Main Line, and is one of Japan&#x27;s oldest stations (the oldest station being , a few kilometres down the line). The original Shimbashi Station, opened on October 10, 1872, was built some way to the east of the modern-day structure and was known as .

The present-day structure opened on 16 December 1909 as on the Yamanote Line. With the extension of the Tōkaidō Main Line along its modern-day route to the new terminus at Tokyo Station in 1914, the original station was demolished to make way for a freight yard, Shiodome Station (汐留駅), and Karasumori Station was renamed Shimbashi Station.

Japan&#x27;s first subway line, operated by the Tokyo Underground Railroad Company, was extended to Shimbashi in 1934. In January 1939, the Tokyo Rapid Railway Company built a second subway station at Shimbashi for its line from Shibuya. After several months, the lines were merged to allow through service, and the TRR station was closed. In 1941 the two companies merged forming today&#x27;s Tokyo Metro Ginza Line. The Ginza Line operated from a single platform until 1980, when a second parallel platform was opened to relieve congestion.

The Toei Asakusa Line began service to Shimbashi in 1968, and the elevated Yurikamome station opened in 1995.

Shiodome Station closed in 1986. The site was declared a national monument in 1996 and the area was archeologically investigated while being redeveloped as a commercial district (&quot;Shiosite&quot;) with a number of large office blocks. In 2003 a reconstruction of the original Shimbashi Station building and part of the platforms was completed. It currently houses a railway history exhibit and a restaurant.

The station facilities of the Ginza Line were inherited by Tokyo Metro after the privatization of the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (TRTA) in 2004.

PASMO smart card coverage at this station began on 18 March 2007.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 254,945 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the seventh busiest station operated by JR East.

The JR East passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

<doc id="390168" wikidata="Q1305374" url="?curid=390168" title="The Cold Six Thousand">
<text>The Cold Six Thousand is a 2001 crime fiction novel by James Ellroy. It is the first sequel to &quot;American Tabloid&quot; in the Underworld USA Trilogy and continues many of the earlier novel&#x27;s characters and plotlines. Specifically, it follows three rogue American law-enforcement officials and their involvement in the turmoil of the 1960s.

==Plot==
Ward Littell, former FBI agent turned high-powered Mafia lawyer, arrives in Dallas with J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s blessing to &quot;manage&quot; the investigation into John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination and ensure a consensus: Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Pete Bondurant, whom Littell once arrested, but now is an uneasy friend and partner, is a veteran of the CIA&#x27;s war against Fidel Castro and now the point-man for the Mafia&#x27;s Las Vegas operations. Wayne Tedrow Jr., a US Army veteran and Las Vegas Police Department officer, is paid six thousand dollars to fly to Dallas and murder Wendell Durfee, a black pimp who has offended the casinos, and is thus thrust into the assassination&#x27;s aftermath. As the tension over race relations and the Vietnam War builds and explodes throughout the 1960s, all three become involved in plots to kill Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy.

==Structure and style==
&quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot; has a structure substantially similar to that of &quot;American Tabloid&quot;. As in &quot;American Tabloid&quot;, the chapters are divided into named Parts, and each chapter is numbered and identified by location and date. The action of the book is completely sequential, as the dates indicate. Each chapter has a limited third person narrative voice from the point of view of one of the three main characters. Interspersed between many chapters are &quot;document inserts&quot; reproducing newspaper clippings, letters, and transcripts of telephone calls. Flashbacks occur, but only in the present tense memory of the protagonists.

The highly stylized prose used in the main chapters builds upon the style used in &quot;American Tabloid&quot; (and, to a certain extent, &quot;White Jazz&quot;). Of the novel&#x27;s style, Ellroy noted:

The style I developed for &quot;The Cold Six Thousand&quot; is a direct, shorter-rather-than-longer sentence style that&#x27;s declarative and ugly and right there, punching you in the nards. It was appropriate for that book, and that book only, because it&#x27;s the 1960s. It&#x27;s largely the story of reactionaries in America during that time, largely a novel of racism and thus the racial invective, and the overall bluntness and ugliness of the language.

==Film adaptation==
In 2002, Bruce Willis optioned the rights to produce and star in a TV miniseries based on &quot;American Tabloid&quot; and &quot;The Cold Six-Thousand.&quot; Willis&#x27;s option expired before production began.

In 2008, HBO and Tom Hanks&#x27;s production company, Playtone, were developing &quot;Tabloid&quot; and &quot;Six Thousand&quot; for either a mini-series or ongoing series. Screenwriter Kirk Ellis was said to be drafting a screenplay for the potential series.

<doc id="390172" wikidata="Q327920" url="?curid=390172" title="Adolfo Ruiz Cortines">
<text>Adolfo Tomás Ruiz Cortines ( 30 December 1889 – 3 December 1973) was a Mexican politician who served as President of Mexico from 1952 to 1958. A member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), he previously served as Governor of Veracruz and Secretary of the Interior. During his presidency, which constituted the Mexican Miracle, women gained the right to vote, and he instigated numerous public health, education, infrastructure, and works projects.

A member of the Constitutional Army, Ruiz Cortines was the last Mexican president to have fought in the Mexican Revolution.
 He worked at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce during the administration of Adolfo de la Huerta and served as an official in the Department of Statistics from 1921 to 1935. Ruiz Cortines joined the Institutional Revolutionary Party and became Senior Official of the Government of the Federal District in 1935 and member of the Chamber of Deputies for Veracruz in 1937. In 1939 he was appointed treasurer of the presidential campaign of Manuel Ávila Camacho and worked as Governor of Veracruz from 1944 to 1948, a position he left to become Secretariat of the Interior during the administration of Miguel Alemán Valdés.

Ruiz Cortines protested as presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1951 and was elected a year later, after winning the disputed 1952 elections. During his administration, he put forward a reform to Article 34 of the Mexican Constitution, giving women the right to vote, and proposed several infrastructure bills, leading to the creation of the National Housing Institute and the National Nuclear Energy Commission. His social policies included the implementation of &quot;aguinaldos&quot;. Unlike previous administrations from the PRI, he was an advocate of fiscal austerity. His administration was noted for increased transparency in contrast to his predecessor.

One of the oldest presidents of Mexico, Ruiz Cortines has been credited with leading a strong economy during the period known as the &quot;Mexican miracle&quot;, and has been praised for personal integrity and increasing confidence in the government through his anti-corruption policies. He was criticized for slower implementation of reforms than some of his predecessors. He has been ranked among the most popular Mexican presidents of the 20th century.

==Early life and education==
Adolfo Tomás Ruiz Cortines was born on 30 December 1889 at 3:00 pm, in the state of Veracruz, into a family of Andalusian descent. His father, Adolfo Ruiz Tejada (1851–1889), &quot;regidor&quot; of Veracruz during the Porfiriato, died two and a half months prior to his birth. His mother was María Cortines de la Cotera (1859–1932).

Ruiz&#x27;s grandfather was José Ruiz y Gómez de la Parra, better known as &quot;José Ruiz Parra&quot;, a member of the State of Veracruz&#x27;s first Congress in 1824, who co-wrote the state&#x27;s constitution. José Ruiz Parra was president of the junta that ruled over the Port of Alvarado during the American Invasion of Veracruz, having to personally sign the surrender of the port in 1847. He was also reputed for organizing fundraisers in favor of the Mexican Army during the Second French Invasion of Mexico, as well as for his deep involvement in the education of the local children. José Ruiz Parra was the maternal grandson of Isidro Gómez de la Parra, &quot;subdelegado&quot; of the Spanish Crown to the province of Tuxtlas (appointed by Bernardo de Gálvez, viceroy of the New Spain), and of his wife Dominga Casado de Toro y Tamariz, herself a descendant of the Luna y Arellano family, holders of the hereditary title of &quot;Mariscal de Castilla&quot;.
Because of his father&#x27;s premature death, Ruiz Cortines was raised and educated by his mother. María Cortines de la Cotera was the daughter of Diego Francisco Cortines y Gutiérrez de Celis (1829, Bielva, Cantabria, Spain), and María Dolores de la Cotera y Calzada (1824, Veracruz, Mexico), whose father was from Peñarrubia, also in Cantabria. His mother taught him to read and write at the age of 3. Later, he entered a school directed by Joaquín Jerónimo Díaz and Florencio Veyro, called &quot;Escuela Amiga&quot;, but did his secondary educational studies at the Colegio de los Jesuitas, and at the age twelve, he attended the reputed &quot;Instituto Veracruzano&quot;, famously directed by the poet Salvador Díaz Mirón. Adolfo learned from his mentors about liberalism, a political principle he would apply during his entire political career. In addition, it was at school where he acquired his fanatical interest in baseball. He always wanted to attend a university, but the American Invasion of 1914 forced him to abandon his studies. His first job was as an accounting assistant at a commercial textile company.

==Military career==
===During the Mexican Revolution===
In 1909, Ruiz read the book &quot;La sucesión presidencial de 1910&quot; (&quot;The Presidential Succession of 1910&quot;) published that year by Francisco I. Madero, the leader of the opposition against President Porfirio Díaz. This book motivated Ruiz&#x27;s interest in politics. In 1910, the Mexican Revolution started and he became inspired by several of its main players such as Pascual Orozco and Pancho Villa. Because of this influence, in 1912 at the age of 23, he moved to Mexico City. During his stay in Mexico City, President Madero was assassinated and General Victoriano Huerta took power. Since Ruiz Cortines was opposed to the Huerta government, considered by a broad group of Mexicans as a usurper, he volunteered alongside other former students of the Instituto Veracruzano, under the command of Alfredo Robles, a right hand of the leader of the Constitutionalist faction, General Venustiano Carranza. Robles was in charge of the anti-Huerta forces in the south and center of Mexico. Ruiz Cortines did see military action in the Battle of El Ébano, but his main task was as a bookkeeper and paymaster. In 1920, Carranza was attempting to flee the country after his defeat by Sonoran generals Adolfo de la Huerta, Álvaro Obregón, and Plutarco Elías Calles, who rejected Carranza&#x27;s attempt to impose his successor, and took with him a large amount of the national treasure (150 million pesos in gold). When the generals captured his train and the national treasure&#x27;s gold, it was the young and trusted officer, Major Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, who received it and delivered it safely and in presence of a notary to General de la Huerta in Mexico City.

===Post-Revolution and resignation===
He continued to serve in the army after the revolution ended. In 1926, he requested and was granted retirement.

==Early political career==
===Early positions===
With his reputation for precise accounting and bookkeeping, a reputation for honesty, and credentials as a veteran of the Mexican Revolution, there were several options open to him in the 1920s. He served in the government&#x27;s Department of National Statistics. He took classes in statistics from Daniel Cosío Villegas, who was then a young teacher and later an important historian of Mexico. Ruiz Cortines argued in publications that the Department of National Statistics should be an autonomous agency. 

In 1935 during the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas, Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s political career began at age 45, as the director in charge of Mexico City. It was during that time that he met Miguel Alemán Valdés, son of a revolutionary soldier, now a young lawyer who would later become president of Mexico (1946–1952). In 1940, Ruiz Cortines managed the presidential campaign of Cárdenas&#x27;s choice as successor, Manuel Avila Camacho. Miguel Alemán asked Ruiz to join him as his sub-secretary because of their personal friendship. This position gave Ruiz the opportunity to gain influence within the Institutional Revolutionary Party. After several years, the PRI designated him as candidate for governor of Veracruz.

===Governor of Veracruz===
In December 1944, Adolfo Ruiz Cortines became governor of Veracruz. During his administration, he expanded public education in the state. Some of the institutions he founded were the Technical Studies Institute (&quot;Departamento para Estudios Técnicos&quot;) which provided people with a practical education that allowed them to improve their quality of life. Furthermore, he founded the Institute of Anthropology and the State Planning Committee, among others. He also modified the local constitution to allow women to participate in the local and municipal elections. He built roads and bridges to develop Veracruz&#x27;s infrastructure since it was one of the main ports of Mexico at that time.

===Secretary of the Interior===
On February 12, 1948, Alemán Valdés&#x27; Secretary of the Interior, , died in office, and Alemán Valdés needed to fill the position. Manuel Ávila Camacho recommended Ruiz Cortines, to which Alemán Valdés agreed. It was in this position that Ruiz Cortines distinguished himself and became a contender for the next presidential election.

==1952 presidential election==

In 1951, Miguel Alemán Valdés expressed his desire to be allowed to serve a second term, but Lázaro Cárdenas and Manuel Ávila Camacho had former president Abelardo L. Rodríguez tell Alemán Valdés that they didn&#x27;t think, &quot;extension of the presidential term or re-election is convenient for the country.&quot; On 14 October 1951, Ruiz Cortines was named candidate for the presidency by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) by the incumbent president, as had become practice. The PRI was the dominant party and Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s electoral victory was entirely expected.

Ruiz Cortines is believed to have been chosen due to his more bland image in contrast to Alemán&#x27;s more colorful personality, and was not seen as divisive to differin sectors of the PRI. Reportedly, Ruiz Cortines accepted the nomination, but he &quot;apparently did not seek it and certainly did not intrigue to secure it.&quot; However, by September, Ruiz Cortines&#x27; base of support within the party had grown considerably, and included many young senators such as Adolfo López Mateos and Gustavo Díaz Ordaz. His campaign began on October 14, 1951, with his slogan being &quot;austerity and work&quot; (). In one of his first speaking events during his campaign, he stated to around 20,000 women in attendance, &quot;If the vote favors us in the next elections, we intend to initiate before the Chambers the necessary legal reforms so that women enjoy the same political rights as men,&quot; a campaign promise he would later fulfill with an amendment to Article 34 of the Constitution.

General Miguel Henríquez Guzmán, formerly of the PRI, who had twice before attempted to secure the party&#x27;s presidential nomination, was the candidate of the Federation of the Mexican People&#x27;s Parties. His support was in largely urban areas, and included Cárdenas supporters alienated during Alemán Valdés&#x27; presidency, established military men, and members of the middle class who desired a multi-party democracy. When asked for his opinion of Ruiz Cortines, Henríquez Guzmán stated:

The National Action Party, eventually the PRI&#x27;s largest political opposition party, first participated in this election, nominating . In González Luna&#x27;s campaign, he addressed social and national problems, including women&#x27;s suffrage, like Ruiz Cortines. Vicente Lombardo Toledano was the Popular Socialist Party&#x27;s candidate.

The election took place on July 7, 1952. When the results were announced, it was revealed that Ruiz Cortines won, with 74.31% of the popular vote (2,713,419 votes). Henríquez Guzmán won 15.87% (579,745 votes), González Luna won 7.82% (285,555 votes), and Lombardo Toledano won 1.98% (72,482 votes).

The day after the election, Henríquez Guzmán&#x27;s supporters gathered in the Alameda Central park in Mexico City to protest reported electoral fraud, including the theft of ballot boxes. The government suppressed the peaceful protests, with an estimated 200 being killed, and more forced disappearances and arrests of people related to the protestors occurring in the following days.

==President of Mexico==
===Inauguration and cabinet===
On 1 December 1952, he assumed the presidency of the republic, at age 62. In his inaugural address, Ruiz Cortines pledged that fighting corruption in the government and in business would be key aspects of his administration, and that he would continue to maintain close relations with the United States.

Ruiz Cortines modified the law to promote responsibility and honesty among public servants to combat increasing amounts of corruption. He created a law that forced public servants to declare their assets before beginning to work in the government, including himself. Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s purpose was to compare the public servants&#x27; fortune before and after their participation in public charges to combat illicit enrichment and corruption.

Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy, , died on May 1 1955 of a myocardial infarction. On May 9, Sub-secretary of the Navy Alfonso Poire Ruelas was nominated to succeed Sánchez Taboada, a position which he held until the 22nd of December of that year. On January 1 1956, Ruiz Cortines nominated Viceadmiral Roberto Gómez Maqueo to fill the position, and he held it until April 1 1958. From April 1 to September 15 of 1958, Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy was Héctor Meixuerio Alexandres.

After becoming president, Ruiz Cortines proposed an alliance to Henríquez Guzmán between their parties. Henríquez Guzmán stated he would only accept if political and economic monopolies were ended. Ruiz Cortines rejected this, and repression against the party continued. The government de-registered them in 1954, and in 1955 the party closed their offices.

===Domestic politics===
After the corruption scandals of the Alemán years, he wanted to give a new image to the government and re-establish its credibility. His credo was &quot;austerity and moralization&quot;. He prosecuted several of Alemán&#x27;s political and business associates who had enriched themselves during the previous administration. He suspended all government contracts in 1953 to cut waste and to root out corruption.

He exercised tight control of public expenditure, supported the construction of roads, railways, dams, schools and hospitals. He also implemented a plan called &quot;March to the Sea&quot;, which had the aim of shifting population from the highlands to the coast, and making better use and development of marine and coastal resources. Under this program, malaria was eradicated. He created the Rural Social Welfare Program to improve the living conditions of the rural population and encouraged land distribution. Large foreign estates were expropriated. Furthermore, he implemented the Farm Security program to protect farmers from natural disasters.

At the beginning of his term, President Ruiz Cortines sent a bill to amend Article 34 of the Constitution to grant women equal political rights with men, which granted the vote to Mexican women. To promote measures to meet the need for homes, he created the National Housing Institute. He gave a stimulus to industry, particularly small- and medium-sized, and laid the foundation for the development of the petrochemical industry and promoted the creation of jobs.

In response to the technical advances in the field of nuclear energy, and considering that Mexico could not remain unaffected by this development, he created the National Nuclear Energy Commission. Primary and secondary education were boosted greatly. He specially supported the polytechnic university. Ruiz Cortines equipped the facilities of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and began subsidies to support universities through the republic.

Another primary goal of his government was to improve the health of men and women in Mexico. Therefore, he fought malnutrition among children and promoted an immunization campaign. Ruiz Cortines turned his attention to social problems and imposed an era of austerity on the Mexican government.

Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s government decided to reduce public spending, to consolidate public finances and fight inflation. These policies led to macroeconomic stability, and contributed to the Mexican economy high growth rates during the 1950s. For first time in many years the Mexican government generated a budget surplus. However, following Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s 1953 suspension of all government contracts, construction companies were weakened, the national output fell, the foreign trade deficit rose by a third, and almost all employers announced layoffs. He chose to shift away from austerity and reoriented his policy towards boosting production, and announced a record $400 million spending plan to pump into public works projects. In April 1954, in the so-called &quot;crisis de la Semana Santa&quot;, he had to devaluate the peso from $8.65 per dollar to $12.50 per dollar. Despite the devaluation, in 1955, Mexico&#x27;s dollar reserves were roughly equivalent to $305 million, the highest since he took office. In December 1955, in a push for a balanced budget, Ruiz Cortines announced the next year&#x27;s budget, 6,696,374,000 pesos ($535,709,920 in 1955), which was an increase from the previous year, but was still considered somewhat conservative given Mexico&#x27;s rapidly growing economy.

By the end of his term in 1958, he had faced three social-political conflicts with peasants, teachers and the labor union of the railroad workers.

Mexico&#x27;s real national income had increased 7% halfway through 1954, and 10% halfway through 1955. In 1954, Mexico&#x27;s electric power output increased 10%, manufacturing increased 9.8%, and crude-oil production increased 15%. By 1955, Mexico&#x27;s crop, coffee, and cotton production and yield had increased 20% since the start of Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s term, at that point an all-time high for Mexico.

===Earthquake of 1957===
On July 28, 1957, an earthquake with an epicenter in the state of Guerrero shook Mexico City for about 90 seconds. It measured 7.7 on the Richter scale. Ruiz Cortines was in his office in the national palace at the time.

=== Foreign relations ===

During Ruiz&#x27; Cortines&#x27;s term, Mexico had cold diplomatic relationships with the United States because Ruiz Cortines refused to make any agreements that committed Mexico to participate in international wars. During his term, Ruiz Cortines completed the construction of projects like Falcon Dam, built with 58.6% American funds and 41.4% Mexican funds. The dam on the Rio Grande (Río Bravo in Mexico) was inaugurated on October 19, 1953, by Ruiz Cortines and United States President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

In 1956, Ruiz Cortines attended a meeting with US President Eisenhower and Canadian Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent of Canada. During the meeting, the leaders discussed immigration issues, economic cooperation, civil aviation and illegal fishing in coastal areas. In general, President Ruiz Cortines&#x27;s foreign policy was conservative and respectful of the sovereignty of other nations. His administration was looking for a closer relationship with Latin America and sought the integration into the institutional system of Latin America, the Organization of American States (OAS). In the Conference of Caracas, held in 1954, Mexico failed in its attempt to defend the self-determination of the people.

In total, Ruiz Cortines only made three foreign visits during his term, which was deliberately a small amount, as he did not want to waste money on planes or waste time on boats.
In 1935, under Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico was one of only five countries to condemn Fascist Italy&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia (then the Ethiopian Empire or Abyssinia) during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War.
In 1953, Ruiz Cortines invited Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Ethiopia, to visit Mexico, who used the opportunity to thank Mexico for condemning the invasion against him. In 1955, Selassie accepted the invitation, and inaugurated at plaque in Mexico City with his country&#x27;s name on it. He inaugurated a plaque with Mexico&#x27;s name on it in his country&#x27;s capital in 1958.

===1958 presidential succession===

In 1957, Ruiz Cortines, as was tradition, was to announce the PRI&#x27;s next presidential candidate. Taking input from ex-presidents Lázaro Cárdenas and Miguel Alemán Valdés, each symbolizing the left and right sectors of the PRI respectively, he announced his hard-working but little-known Labor Minister Adolfo López Mateos as the next candidate, with international observers seeing López Mateos as the sure winner despite his relative obscurity. López Mateos eventually won the election with 90% of the popular vote.

==Post-presidency==
On 1 December 1958, Ruiz handed over power to his successor López Mateos, and then he retired from public life almost altogether. In 1964, he attended the inauguration of López Mateos&#x27; successor, President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz.

According to Miguel Alemán Velasco, President Luis Echeverría once consulted Ruiz Cortines via telephone on an unspecified policy. Ruiz Cortines disagreed with Echeverría&#x27;s idea, but Echeverría didn&#x27;t take his advice.

In his last days, his friend Manuel Caldelas García, a politician whom he had known in his youth, began living with him at his home in Veracruz. Caldelas helped with household chores and took care of the former president. On the afternoon of 3 December 1973, the health status of Ruiz Cortines became critical. Dr. Mario Díaz Tejeda went to the home to treat the condition of the former president. When the drugs took effect on him, Ruiz Cortines fell asleep. At 9:05 am on Monday, 3 December 1973, Adolfo Tomás Ruiz Cortines died at 83 years of age, a victim of heart failure caused by arteriosclerosis.

==Personal life==
In 1915 he married his first wife, Lucía Carrillo Guitiérrez, the daughter of Veracruz&#x27;s then-governor, Lauro Carrillo. Ruiz Cortines and Lucía later divorced. Their first child, María Cristina Ruiz Carrillo, was born on December 6, 1917. Their second child, Lucía Ruiz Carrillo, was born on May 1, 1919. Their third child, Adolfo Ruiz Carrillo, was born on November 28, 1922.

He married his second wife, an old girlfriend named María de Dolores Izaguirre, in 1941, who would serve as his First Lady. She would become the first woman in Mexico to cast a vote after her husband passed the constitutional amendment promised during his campaign.

Ruiz Cortines was known to frequently play domino games.

<text>James Tully (18 September 1915 – 20 May 1992) was an Irish Labour Party politician and trade unionist. He served as Minister for Defence from 1981 to 1982, Deputy leader of the Labour Party from 1981 to 1982 and Minister for Local Government from 1973 to 1977. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Meath constituency from 1954 to 1957 and 1961 to 1982.

A native of Carlanstown, near Kells in the north of County Meath, Tully was educated in Carlanstown schools and in St Patrick&#x27;s Classical School in Navan. He was elected to Dáil Éireann as a Labour Party TD for the Meath constituency at the 1954 general election. He lost his seat at the 1957 general election, but was re-elected at the 1961 general election and served until 1982. When Labour entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael in 1973, he was appointed Minister for Local Government. While serving in that post he gained prominence for a massive increase in the building of public housing, and notoriety for an attempt to gerrymander Irish constituencies to ensure the re-election of the National Coalition at the 1977 general election. His electoral reorganisation effort via the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974, which came to be called a &quot;Tullymander&quot;, backfired spectacularly and helped engineer a landslide for the opposition, Fianna Fáil. He was regarded as a conservative within the Labour Party, though tended to support party decisions, even if he disagreed with them. For many years he was opposed to coalition, though finding the years in opposition fruitless, he changed his mind and became increasingly in favour of coalition with Fine Gael.

Also as Minister for Local government, Tully decided on alterations to the plans for the controversial Dublin Corporation Civic Offices.

Tully was appointed deputy leader of the Labour Party under Michael O&#x27;Leary in 1981, and Minister for Defence in the short-lived 1981–82 Fine Gael-Labour Party government. In that capacity he traveled to Cairo, in 1981, as the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s representative in Egypt&#x27;s annual 6 October military victory parade. While in the reviewing stand, next to President Anwar Sadat, he suffered a shrapnel injury to his face when Sadat was assassinated by members of Egyptian Islamic Jihad who had infiltrated the Egyptian Army.

In 1982, a few months after the event, James Tully retired from politics. He died ten years later at the age of 76.

<doc id="390175" wikidata="Q590162" url="?curid=390175" title="Yoyogi Station">
<text>is a railway station in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan, operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei). It is station E-26 under Toei&#x27;s numbering system.

==Station layout ==
===JR East===
The JR East station consists of two ground-level side platforms on either side of an island platform, serving four tracks in total. 


Chest-high platform edge doors were installed on the Yamanote Line platforms in September 2015, and brought into use from October.

There are three exits: East exit, West exit, and North exit. The latter two provide easy access to the Oedo line.

===Toei===
The Toei Oedo Line station has one underground island platform serving two tracks.

==History==
The station first opened on 23 October 1906 by a private company as a station on the Chūō Main Line, but was nationalized only a week later when the Japanese National Railways (JNR) took over the company and all of its assessments. The underground Toei Ōedo Line station opened on 20 April 2000.

Station numbering was introduced to the JR East platforms in 2016 with Yoyogi being assigned station numbers JB11 for the Chūō-Sobu line, and JY18 for the Yamanote line.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 70,016 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the 63rd-busiest station operated by JR East. In fiscal 2013, the Toei station was used by an average of 17,382 passengers daily (boarding passengers only). The daily average passenger figures (boarding passengers only) for JR East in previous years are as shown below.

<doc id="390179" wikidata="Q2916247" url="?curid=390179" title="I. F. Stone">
<text>Isidor Feinstein Stone (December 24, 1907 – June 18, 1989) was an American investigative journalist, writer, and author.

Known for his politically progressive views, Stone is best remembered for &quot;I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot; (1953–1971), a newsletter which the New York University journalism department in 1999 ranked 16th among the top hundred works of journalism in the U.S. in the twentieth century and second place among print journalism publications. Stone&#x27;s reputation has been dogged by allegations of contact with or espionage for the Soviet Union.

==Early life==
I. F. Stone was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jewish Russian immigrants who owned a shop in Haddonfield, New Jersey; the journalist and film critic Judy Stone was his sister.

Stone attended Haddonfield High School. He was ranked 49th in his graduating class of 52 students. His career as a journalist began in his second year of high school, when he founded &quot;The Progress&quot; newspaper. He later worked for the &quot;Haddonfield Press&quot; and for the &quot;Camden Courier-Post&quot;. After dropping out of the University of Pennsylvania, where he had studied philosophy, Stone joined &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, then known as the &quot;Republican Bible of Pennsylvania&quot;.

After advice from a newspaper editor in 1937, Stone changed his professional journalistic byline from Isidore Feinstein Stone to I. F. Stone; the editor had told him that his political reportage would be better received if he minimized his Jewish identity. Years later, Stone acknowledged being remorseful about having changed his professional name, thereby yielding to the systemic anti-Semitism then prevalent in American society. Personally, Stone spoke of himself as &quot;Izzy&quot; throughout his life and career.

==Politics in the 1930s==
Influenced by the social work of Jack London, Stone became a politically radical journalist and joined the &quot;Philadelphia Record&quot; (the morning edition rival of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;) owned by J. David Stern, a Democrat. Stone later worked for the &quot;New York Post&quot; newspaper after Stern bought it during 1929. In late adolescence, Stone joined the Socialist Party of America, a political decision influenced by his reading of the works of Karl Marx, Jack London, Peter Kropotkin and Herbert Spencer. Later, he quit the Socialist Party due to the intractable sectarian divisions, ideological and political, that existed among the organizations that constituted the American Left.

During the 1930s, Stone was an active member of the communist-dominated Popular Front, which opposed Adolf Hitler and National Socialism. On May 1, 1935, Stone joined the League of American Writers (1935–1943), whose members included Lillian Hellman, Dashiell Hammett, Frank Folsom, Alexander Trachtenberg, Louis Untermeyer, Myra Page, Millen Brand and Arthur Miller. (Members were largely either Communist Party members or fellow travelers.)
During the 1930s, as a left-wing journalist, Stone criticized Joseph Stalin&#x27;s consolidation of power in the Soviet Union in an editorial for the &quot;New York Post&quot; (December 7, 1934) that denounced and likened Stalin&#x27;s purge and execution of Soviet citizens to the political purges and executions occurring in Nazi Germany (1933–1945) and stated that Stalin&#x27;s régime in Russia had adopted the tactics of &quot;Fascist thugs and racketeers.&quot; As the Moscow Trials (1936–1938) proceeded, Stone attacked Stalin&#x27;s actions as heralding a new &quot;Thermidor&quot;, which was the time of counterrevolution and reaction against the French Revolution (1789–1799). Additionally, Stone criticized Lenin and Trotsky for their &quot;cruel and bloody ruthlessness&quot; in executing the Romanov family. He scolded the US Socialist Workers Party, then followers of Trotsky, for believing he would have been less repressive than Stalin.

However, in 1939, following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, he wrote to a friend that he would do &quot;no more fellow traveling&quot; for the U.S.S.R., and used his opinion column in &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine to denounce Joseph Stalin as &quot;the Moscow Machiavelli who suddenly found peace as divisible as the Polish plains and marshes&quot;. Stone bitterly denounced the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact in public and in private as a betrayal of leftist political principles.

==Affiliations==
A former editor of &quot;The Nation&quot;, Victor Navasky, said that plain, solid work characterized Stone&#x27;s investigative journalism. He was an old-school reporter who did his homework and perused public-domain records (official government and private-industry documents) for the facts and figures, the data, and quotations that would substantiate his reportage about the matters of the day.

As a liberal, politically outspoken reporter from the American left wing, Stone often had to work in ideologically hostile environments (military, diplomatic, business) where information was controlled, making verifiability the essence of his journalism, corroborated by facts in the public domain, which the reader could verify. About his style of work as an investigative journalist, Stone said:
I made no claims to &#x27;inside stuff&#x27;. I tried to give information which could be documented, so [that] the reader could check it for himself ... Reporters tend to be absorbed by the bureaucracies they cover; they take on the habits, attitudes, and even accents of the military or the diplomatic corps. Should a reporter resist the pressure, there are many ways to get rid of him. ... But a reporter covering the whole capital on his own – particularly if he is his own employer – is immune from these [political] pressures.

The journalistic professionalism and integrity of I. F. Stone derived from his intellectual willingness to scour and devour public documents, to bury himself in &quot;The Congressional Record&quot;, to study the transcripts of obscure congressional committee hearings, debates and reports. He prospected for news nuggets – published as boxed paragraphs in his weekly newsletter – such as contradictions in the line of official policy, examples of bureaucratic mendacity and political obscurantism. Stone especially sought evidence of the U.S. government&#x27;s legalistic incursions against the civil liberties and the civil and political rights of American citizens.

===The &quot;New York Post&quot;===
In 1933, Stone worked as a reporter for the &quot;New York Post&quot; newspaper. He supported the politics of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1933–1945), especially the progressive reforms of the New Deal (1935–1938) programs FDR was instituting to rescue the U.S. economy from the poverty imposed by the Great Depression which started in 1929. In his first book, &quot;The Court Disposes&quot; (1937), Stone criticized what he described as the politically reactionary role of the U.S. Supreme Court in blocking the realization of the socio-economic reform programs of the New Deal. 

In the course of working as publisher and reporter, Stern and Stone quarreled about journalism, its practice and its practices, especially about the content and tone of Stone&#x27;s &quot;New York Post&quot; editorials critical of a business plan to refinance the public transit system of New York City. After an acrimonious quarrelling, Stern&#x27;s concern about Stone&#x27;s juvenile attitude prompted an inter-office note to Izzy and the managing editor, informing them that, henceforth, the reporter I. F. Stone was part of the news-department staff.

In response to his publisher&#x27;s management decision – subordinating a reporter to the newsroom managing editor – Stone complained to the Newspaper Guild, presenting his case against the managers of the newspaper for unfair labor practices. The &quot;Post&quot; contested the case, which proceeded to an arbitration hearing that ruled against the reporter Stone, who consequently quit his job at the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

===&quot;The Nation&quot;===
In 1939, after leaving the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Stone worked for &quot;The Nation&quot;, first as associate editor and then as its Washington, D.C., editor. Two years later, in the book &quot;Business as Usual: The First Year of Defense&quot; (1941), Stone reported on perceived flaws of the early stages of America&#x27;s WW2 preparation. He alleged inefficient planning and execution, and the business-as-usual attitude, of the industrial and business monopolies — and its tolerance by the U.S. military — that resulted in the tardy production of matériel for the Arsenal of Democracy with which President F. D. Roosevelt said the U.S. would help Europeans and Asians combat the totalitarianism of National Socialist German Workers Party, fascist Italy and Imperial Japan.

On August 4, 1939, Stone along with 400 other writers and intellectuals signed a letter condemning anti-Soviet attitudes in the United States, called for better relations between the two countries, described the USSR as a supporter of world peace, and said &quot;The Soviet Union considers political dictatorship a transitional form and has shown a steadily expanding democracy&quot;. The letter was published in September 1939 shortly after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was known in the United States and during the same month that the Soviet invasion of Poland began. Upon hearing of the Pact, Stone repudiated the letter and denounced the actions of the Soviet Union and would criticize it and the CPUSA, which repeated the views of the USSR about the war. In return the CPUSA denounced him as one of the leading &quot;Imperialist war-mongers&quot; until Operation Barbarossa which caused a change in communist views of the war.&quot;

In the matter of war-production employment, Stone&#x27;s exposé of alleged institutional racism and anti–Semitism of the FBI&#x27;s process for vetting job applicants is evident in the semantics of questions meant to discover, identify and exclude political subversives from civil service in the U.S. government. He characterized questions the FBI asked about job applicants as ideological and bigoted, such as, &quot;Does he mix with Negroes?&quot;, &quot;Does he ... have too many Jewish friends?&quot;, &quot;Does he think the colored races are as good as the white?&quot;, &quot;Why do you suppose he has hired so many Jews?&quot; and &quot;Is he always criticizing Vichy France?&quot; All which Stone believed were poor questions to ask during a war in which collaborationist Vichy France (1940–44) actively participated in the military occupation as the puppet régime of France. To the mainstream American reader concerned with the affairs of daily life, Stone reported that, &quot;Questions like these are being used as a sieve to strain anti-fascists and liberals out of the government. They serve no other purpose.&quot;. Readers thanked &quot;The Nation&quot; for Stone&#x27;s informing the public of the FBI&#x27;s racist, fascistic and anti-Semitic un–American activities. Concomitantly, some on the American political right wing criticized Stone for maintaining the anonymity of his FBI sources.

In 1946 Freda Kirchwey, the editor (1933–55) of &quot;The Nation&quot;, fired Stone from the magazine for accepting employment with the newspaper &quot;PM&quot; (picture magazine) as a foreign correspondent covering the anti–British Jewish Resistance Movement in Mandatory Palestine (1920–48), where the Jews awaited the foundation of the State of Israel.

===&quot;PM&quot; (newspaper)===
Stone was the Washington, D.C., correspondent for &quot;PM&quot;, and published a series of feature articles about the Jewish European refugees who ran the British blockade to reach Palestine. He later further developed that reportage and wrote the book &quot;Underground to Palestine&quot;. In 1948 &quot;Picture Magazine&quot; closed, and was replaced in Stone&#x27;s career first by the &quot;New York Star (1948-1949)&quot; and then by &quot;The Daily Compass&quot;, published until 1952.

===&quot;I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot;===
Although Stone had been a mainstream journalist in the 1930s, appearing on shows like &quot;Meet the Press&quot; (then a radio show), in 1950 he found himself blacklisted and unable to get work, possibly because Stone publicly admitted to his &quot;fellow traveler&quot; tendencies. In 1953, inspired by the example of the muckraking journalist George Seldes and his political weekly, &quot;In Fact&quot;, Stone started his own independent newsletter, &quot;I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Over the next few years, Stone&#x27;s newsletter campaigned against McCarthyism and racial discrimination in the United States.

During this period he supported the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

In 1964, using evidence drawn from a close reading and analysis of published accounts, Stone was the only American journalist to challenge President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s account of the Gulf of Tonkin incident. During the 1960s, Stone continued to criticize the Vietnam War. At its peak in the 1960s, the &quot;Weekly&quot; only had a circulation of 70,000, but it was regarded as very influential.
Articles originally published in &quot;I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot; later were compiled and published in &quot;The I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly Reader&quot; (1973), in three of six volumes of &quot;A Nonconformist History of Our Times&quot; (1989), a compendium of Stone&#x27;s writing, and &quot;The Best of I.F. Stone&quot; (2006).

==Views==
===Zionism and the State of Israel===
In 1945, at war&#x27;s end, Stone went to Mandatory Palestine (1920–1948) to report on the mass emigration of Eastern European Jews to Mandatory Palestine—peoples whom the Nazis had displaced from the countries of Eastern Europe. In &quot;Underground to Palestine&quot; (1948), Stone reported that the political, financial and personal interests of those displaced Jews would have been, in his opinion, better served by emigrating to the U.S. rather than to the Zionist Homeland for the Jewish people promised in the Balfour Declaration. Nonetheless, they preferred the promise of Israel in Stone&#x27;s estimation because:
They have been kicked around as Jews, and now they want to live as Jews. Over and over I heard it said: &#x27;We want to build a Jewish country ... We are tired of putting our sweat and blood into places where we are not welcome. ... &#x27; These Jews want the right to live as a people, to build as a people, to make their contribution to the world as a people. Are their national aspirations any less worthy of respect than those of any other oppressed people?

As a secular Jew, Stone agreed with the nationalist aspirations of Zionism and publicly supported the State of Israel (1948), before the U.S. government granted official recognition. As a politically moderate Zionist, and like the politician Abba Eban, Stone supported the one-state solution of Israel as a bi-national state that Jews and Arabs would inhabit as equal citizens. Yet, in observing the military conflict that established the Jewish state in Mandatory Palestine, Stone became sympathetic to the Arab resistance to their physical dispossession (jobs, homes, land) and the political disenfranchisement (voided civil and political rights).

Stone&#x27;s reportage of the conflict in the Middle East irritated Minister Eban, both for embarrassing him (a politically moderate Zionist) and his government and for dimming the international public image of the State of Israel as a refuge for oppressed peoples.

===The Arab–Israeli conflict===

The practical and professional consequences of being an openly left-wing journalist in the U. S. continued for I. F. Stone, when the U.S. State Department refused to issue a passport for him to travel overseas as a journalist. Stone filed a lawsuit against the State Department. In court, his brother-in-law, the attorney Leonard Boudin, established the right of a journalist to freely travel in the course of practicing his profession, and so thwarted the federal government&#x27;s political interference with a journalist; afterwards, Stone travelled to Israel in 1956—before the Suez War (Oct 29 – November 7, 1956)—and reported that:

Consequent to the establishment of British, French, and Russian imperial spheres of influence in Asia Minor, by way of the Sykes–Picot Agreement (1916), the internal politics of the State of Israel became the Arab–Israeli conflict (1948 to date), which the West conflated to the geopolitics of the Cold War (1945–90) with each belligerent party, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., claiming hegemony over the Middle East.

In the book review article &quot;Holy War&quot; (&quot;Les Temps Modernes&quot;, June 1967), Stone said that superpower geopolitics are of secondary importance to the discontent of the Arabs and the Jews in the Levant.

===The Korean War===
Stone was critical of the Cold War, and its consequent reductions of the civil liberties and the civil and political rights of American citizens – what he saw as totalitarianism effected with the moral panic of loyalty oaths and the Second Red Scare (1947–57) of the McCarthy Era — Stone wrote a book on the origin of the Korean War (1950–52). According to Stone, in an effort to convince the American people to support and fight in a war between two undemocratic Asian countries, U.S. government propaganda misrepresented the Korean War as necessary to the rollback fight against the international communist conspiracy for world domination, with Joseph Stalin controlling the conspiracy from Moscow.

In &quot;The Hidden History of the Korean War, 1950–51&quot;, Stone said that South Korea had provoked North Korea to war, by way of continual guerrilla attacks across the border (38th parallel) into the north of Korea, and that, thus goaded, the North Koreans eventually counterattacked, and invaded the South, providing the official &quot;casus belli&quot; (June 25, 1950) required for Korean reunification. Stone asserted that such cross-border attacks, authorized by the South Korean government, were shaped by U.S. foreign policy for the worldwide containment of communism, which was advocated by John Foster Dulles, realized in the field by General Douglas MacArthur, U.S. commander in the Pacific Ocean military theater, and countenanced by Syngman Rhee, the strongman President of South Korea.

==Allegations of espionage==
=== Oleg Kalugin&#x27;s comments ===

In &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper in 1992, British journalist Andrew Brown reported that the Soviet Embassy attaché, KGB Major General Oleg Kalugin, said that, &quot;We had an agent—a well-known American journalist—with a good reputation, who severed his ties with us after 1956. I, myself, convinced him to resume them. But, in 1968, after the invasion of Czechoslovakia ... he said he would never again take any money from us.&quot;

In &quot;How Many I. F. Stones Were There?&quot;, Herbert Romerstein, formerly of USIA and of the HUAC, and Ray Kerrison reported that Kalugin had identified I. F. Stone as the secret agent of whom he [Kalugin] had spoken with the journalist Andrew Brown. Eight years later, in &quot;The Venona Secrets&quot; (2000), Romerstein and Eric Breindel (editorial page editor of the &quot;New York Post&quot;) developed Kalugin&#x27;s allegations about I. F. Stone being a secret agent for the Soviet Union.

In &quot;The Attack on I.F. Stone&quot;, Andrew Brown said that when he &quot;used the phrase &quot;an agent&quot;, to describe someone who turned out to be I. F. Stone&quot;, he understood the term metaphorically, meaning someone who was a &quot;useful contact&quot;, and that the expression &quot;take any money&quot; referred to the fact that the journalist I.F. Stone would not permit a Soviet embassy employee to pay for a luncheon meal, neither then nor in the future, despite earlier lunches in the 1930s and 1940s. That, in September 1992, at the Moscow Journalists&#x27; Club, Kalugin had explained to the lawyer Martin Garbus that, &quot;I have no proof that Stone was an agent. I have no proof that Stone ever received any money from the KGB, or the Russian government, I never gave Stone any money and was never involved with him as an agent.&quot;

In &quot;Who&#x27;s Out to Lunch Here?: I. F. Stone and the KGB&quot;, Cassandra Tate said that the alleged evidence of Stone&#x27;s secret agent involvement with the KGB is based upon a few lines of text at the end of a speech by a KGB officer. She concluded that Stone was neither a Soviet agent, nor a collaborator of the KGB in the U.S.

In &quot;American Radical:The Life and Times of I. F. Stone&quot;, 2009), D. D. Guttenplan cited Kalugin&#x27;s denials in &quot;The Nation&quot; and in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, although an earlier article had pointed to the possible ambiguity of the KGB&#x27;s definition of the term &quot;agent of influence.&quot; In multiple interviews, Kalugin contradicted Romerstein&#x27;s allegation that Stone was a Soviet secret agent; two Stone biographers reported Kalugin&#x27;s third-party denials that Stone was a Soviet secret agent. Myra MacPherson (&quot;All Governments Lie! The Life and Times of Rebel Journalist I. F. Stone&quot;, 2006) reported that Kalugin said: &quot;We had no clandestine relationship. We had no secret arrangement. I was the press officer [of the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C.] ... I never paid him anything. I sometimes bought lunch.&quot;

In his KGB memoirs, &quot;The First Directorate: My 32 Years in Intelligence and Espionage Against the West&quot; (1994), about working as a press attaché in the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., Kalugin said that, besides I. F. Stone, he often met with journalists such as Walter Lippmann, Joseph Kraft, Drew Pearson, Chalmers Johnson, and Murray Marder. That Stone occasionally had a working-lunch with the Soviet press-attaché on shift, but ended that luncheon relationship after his first visit to the Soviet Union in 1956, and after hearing &quot;On the Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot; (February 26, 1956), the secret speech with which Nikita Khrushchev denounced the tyranny of Josef Stalin. When he returned from the Soviet Union, in his weekly newsletter, Stone wrote:
Whatever the consequences, I have to say what I really feel, after seeing the Soviet Union, and carefully studying the statements of its leading officials. &quot;This is not a good society and it is not led by honest men&quot; ... Nothing has happened in Russia to justify cooperation abroad, between the independent Left and the Communists.

Stone&#x27;s published statements, about the Soviet Union, its regimented society, and its totalitarian government, by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), provoked hundreds of subscribers to cancel their subscriptions to &quot;I.F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot; newsletter. Kalugin said that he persuaded Stone to continue having working-luncheons with him, but that, after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Stone refused to let Kalugin pay for the lunch, and consequently ceased meeting with him.

===Venona Project===
In 1995, the National Security Agency (NSA) published documents from the Venona Project (1943–80), a counter-intelligence program for the collection and decryption of KGB and GRU telegraph messages, collected from 1943 to 1980. On September 13, 1944, the KGB station in New York City transmitted a message to Moscow that Vladimir Pravdin, an NKVD officer working undercover as a reporter for TASS (the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union), had sought to communicate with a Soviet agent code-named BLIN, in Washington, DC, but that BLIN had been avoiding a meeting with Pravdin, claiming that his work schedule did not permit the requested meeting. He reported that Samuel Krafsur, an American NKVD agent codenamed IDE, who worked for TASS in the building that housed Stone&#x27;s office, had tried to &quot;sound him out, but BLIN did not react.&quot;

The Venona project transcript No. 1506 (October 23, 1944), indicated that Pravdin had succeeded in meeting with secret agent BLIN, and that he was &quot;not refusing his aid&quot; but explained that had &quot;three children, and did not want to attract the attention of the FBI&quot; and that BLIN&#x27;s reluctance to meet Pravdin derived from &quot;his unwillingness to spoil his career&quot; because he &quot;earned $1,500.00 per month but ... would not be averse to having a supplemental income.&quot;

In the article &quot;Cables Coming in From the Cold&quot; on the Venona Project transcripts, Walter Schneir and Miriam Schneir said that interpreting the transcriptions is difficult, because of the hearsay nature of the messages; the many steps between a conversation and the sending of a cable; language-translation difficulties; the possibility of an imperfect decryption; and concluded that &quot;the Venona messages are not like the old TV show &quot;You Are There&quot; [1953–57], in which history was re‑enacted before our eyes. They are history seen through a glass, darkly.&quot;

In their Cold War history, &quot;Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America&quot; (2000), John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr said that Stone was the Soviet secret agent BLIN. They cited four Venona cables that mentioned Stone and that two of the cables contained evidence of Stone&#x27;s pro–Soviet espionage. As well, the files of the KGB, from 1936 to 1939, indicate that Stone was a Soviet secret agent, who worked as a talent spotter, as a courier to other secret agents, and that he provided private and journalistic information to KGB, and Stone collaborated with the Communist Victor Perlo group, who gave him materials for use in journalistic exposés.

Moreover, in &quot;The Venona Secrets: The Definitive Exposé of Soviet Espionage in America&quot; (2000), Herbert Romerstein and Eric Breindel re-published the allegation that Stone was the Soviet secret agent BLIN. As evidence, they cited Stone&#x27;s statement, in a column (November 11, 1951) that responded to &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; reportage about his left wing sympathies, and that he would be unsurprised to read in that newspaper, &quot;that I was smuggled in from Pinsk, in a carton of blintzes&quot;. That Stone&#x27;s use of the word &quot;blintzes&quot; (pancakes) betrayed his knowledge of the word BLIN, his code name as a Soviet secret agent.

In the event, Stone&#x27;s biographer Myra MacPherson said that the FBI never identified BLIN as being Stone and instead suspected Ernest K. Lindley, who also was father to three children. The FBI claimed that secret agent BLIN must have been someone &quot;whose true, pro–Soviet sympathies were not known to the public&quot;, hence, could not have been the journalist Stone, who, on the contrary, far from being &quot;fearful&quot;, did not hide his left wing beliefs. Rather than wishing to avoid FBI attention, as BLIN reportedly did, Stone made a point of suggesting to the Soviet press attaché Oleg Kalugin that they have lunch at Harvey&#x27;s, a favorite haunt of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, to &quot;tweak his nose&quot;.

=== Alexander Vassiliev&#x27;s allegations of espionage ===
In &quot;Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America&quot; (2009), Klehr, Haynes, and Alexander Vassiliev, formerly of KGB, cite a KGB file [which Vassiliev saw in the Soviet Union] that named &quot;Isidor Feinstein, a commentator for the &quot;New York Post&quot;&quot; in the 1930s, as being secret agent BLIN, who &quot;entered the channel of normal operational work&quot; in 1936. That a note listed BLIN as an agent of the KGB station in New York City, in 1938. Klehr, Haynes, and Vassiliev said that Stone &quot;assisted Soviet intelligence on a number of tasks, ranging from doing some talent spotting, acting as a courier, by relaying information to other agents, and providing private journalist tidbits and data [that] the KGB found interesting&quot;.

That BLIN was to help recruit and support the German resistance to Nazism in Berlin, from 1936 to 1938. Yet the authors admitted that Stone broke with the KGB after the Nazi–Soviet Pact of 1939, and speculate that later Soviet communications with Stone were meant to reactivate their previous relationship. As such, Klehr, Haynes, and Vassiliev conclude that: &quot;The documentary record shows that I. F. Stone consciously cooperated with Soviet intelligence, from 1936 through 1938, [Stone&#x27;s Popular Front period]. An effort was made, by Soviet intelligence, to reestablish that relationship in 1944–45; we do not know whether that effort succeeded. To put it plainly, from 1936 to 1939 I. F. Stone was a Soviet spy&quot;.

In the article &quot;Commentary&#x27;s Trumped-up Case Against I. F. Stone&quot;, Jim Naureckas counters that the allegations of Klehr, Haynes, and Vassiliev, if true, merely indicate that I. F. Stone was &quot;just gossiping&quot;, and criticizes them their &quot;nefarious&quot; and &quot;tendentious&quot; magnification of &quot;relatively innocuous behavior&quot; on the basis of one anti–Nazi activity. As for Stone being listed as an &quot;agent&quot; of the KGB, Naureckas said that Walter Lippmann also is listed as a Soviet secret agent.

In the article &quot;I.F. Stone: Encounters with Soviet Intelligence&quot;, Max Holland said there is no question that I. F. Stone was a &quot;fully recruited and witting agent&quot; for the Soviet Union from 1936 to 1938; yet, admits that Stone &quot;was not a &#x27;spy&#x27; in that he did not engage in espionage, and had no access to classified material&quot;.

In the book review of &quot;Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America&quot; (May 25, 2009), D. D. Guttenplan said that &quot;&quot;Spies&quot; never explains why we should believe KGB officers, pushed to justify their existence (and expense accounts), when they claim information comes from an elaborately recruited &#x27;agent&#x27; rather than merely a source or contact&quot;. That the authors of &quot;Spies&quot; distort the report in Venona transcript No. 1506 (October 1944) and never prove that, in 1936, Soviet secret agent BLIN was I. F. Stone. That their allegations merely demonstrate that Stone &quot;was a good reporter&quot;, and notes that Walter Lippmann is quoted in &quot;Spies&quot; as having professional contacts with &quot;a Soviet journalist with whom he traded insights and information.&quot; This is the same man [Pravdin] whom Stone is said to have avoided. Nonetheless, the Vassilev notebook shows that Lippman was meeting Pravdin, not to pass the intelligence to him, but rather to find out what the true intentions of the Soviet government were. One of the KGB reports said, &quot;He [Lippmann] is attempting to use his acquaintance with him [Pravdin] to determine our viewpoint on various issues of international politics. He is doing this, of course, very subtly, with the utmost tact. It should be recognized that by attempting to draw &#x27;Sergei&#x27; into making candid comments, Imperialist [Lippmann] is sharing his own information with him&quot;.

In the book review of &quot;Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America&quot; (2010), Myra MacPherson said that the American co-author of the book, the journalist Max Holland, had persistently repeated discredited allegations that the American journalist I. F. Stone had accepted money from the Soviet Union, despite Holland&#x27;s having acknowledged the unreliability of his source, KGB Gen. Oleg Kalugin:

As for the conflicting tales, woven by former KGB agent Kalugin, about his relationship with Stone, from 1966 to 1968, Holland correctly notes that &#x27;Kalugin seemed incapable of telling the same story more than once&#x27;. Still, this did not keep Holland from repeating the damaging and long-refuted lie that Herbert Romerstein, former HUAC sleuth, developed after talking with Kalugin, that Moscow Gold subsidized Stone&#x27;s weekly. Nowhere is there any evidence that Stone took money for anything, except a possible lunch or two. Nor is there any evidence, as Holland points out, that Kalugin was able to plant [news] stories with Stone.

==Retirement and classical scholarship==
In 1971, angina pectoris forced Stone to cease publication of the &quot;Weekly&quot;. After his retirement, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania, where he had dropped out years before. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in classical languages. Stone successfully learned Ancient Greek and wrote a book about the prosecution and death of Socrates, &quot;The Trial of Socrates&quot;, in which he argued that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death to shame Athenian democracy, which he despised. &quot;The Trial of Socrates&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller and was translated into 11 languages.

In 1970, Stone received the George Polk Award, and in 1976 he received the Conscience-in-Media Award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors.

==Personal life and death==
In 1929, Stone married Esther Roisman, who later worked as his assistant at &quot;I. F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Their marriage produced three children, Celia, Jeremy, and Christopher. Esther&#x27;s sister Jean, a poet, was the wife of radical lawyer Leonard Boudin. (Stone was thus the uncle of Weather Underground co-founder Kathy Boudin and conservative U.S. judge Michael Boudin.) The Stones&#x27; marriage lasted for sixty years. In 1989, Stone died of a heart attack in Boston at the age of 81.

==Legacy==
=== Memorial awards ===
On March 5, 2008, Harvard&#x27;s Nieman Foundation for Journalism announced plans to award an annual I. F. Stone Medal for Journalistic Independence and an associated I. F. Stone Workshop on Strengthening Journalistic Independence.

In 2008, the Park Center for Independent Media at the Roy H. Park School of Communications created the Izzy Award. The award goes to &quot;an independent outlet, journalist, or producer for contributions to our culture, politics, or journalism created outside traditional corporate structures&quot; for &quot;special achievement in independent media&quot;.

=== Documentaries ===
On May 6, 2015, the non-profit peace organization, Catalytic Diplomacy, released &quot;The Legacy of I.F. Stone, Part One&quot; and &quot;Part Two&quot;, a pair of documentary videos exploring the legacy and influence of I. F. Stone and &quot;I.F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

In 2016, the film &quot;ALL GOVERNMENTS LIE: Truth, Deception, and the Spirit of I.F. Stone&quot; was released; a documentary on independent journalism in which the work and principles of I.F. Stone as an outcast journalist articulate the narrative.

=== Archive ===
The entire run of &quot;I.F. Stone&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from January 17, 1953, through December 1, 1971, can be accessed through the ifstone.org website, along with many of Stone&#x27;s speeches and other writings, and the documentary videos &quot;The Legacy of I.F. Stone, Part One&quot; and &quot;The Legacy of I.F. Stone, Part Two&quot;.

=== Music ===
Composer Scott Johnson makes extensive use of Stone&#x27;s voice taken from a recorded 1981 lecture in his large-scale musical work, &quot;How It Happens&quot;, completed in 1991 on commission for the Kronos Quartet.

=== Nobel Prize ===
He was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1967 and for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1974.

=== Influences ===
The 2008 Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards listed Stone&#x27;s &quot;The Trial of Socrates&quot; as one of his three favorite books.

<text>Roger Lee Reynolds (born July 18, 1934) is an American composer. He is known for his capacity to integrate diverse ideas and resources, and for the seamless blending of traditional musical sounds with those newly enabled by technology. Beyond composition, his contributions to musical life include mentorship, algorithmic design, engagement with psychoacoustics, writing books and articles, and festival organization.

During his early career, Reynolds worked in Europe and Asia, returning to the US in 1969 to accept an appointment in the music department at the University of California, San Diego. His leadership there established it as a state of the art facility – in parallel with Stanford, IRCAM, and MIT – a center for composition and computer music exploration. Reynolds won early recognition with Fulbright, Guggenheim, National Endowment for the Arts, and National Institute of Arts and Letters awards. In 1989, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for a string orchestra composition, &quot;Whispers Out of Time&quot;, an extended work responding to John Ashbery’s ambitious &quot;Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror&quot;. Reynolds is principal or co-author of five books and numerous journal articles and book chapters. In 2009 he was appointed University Professor, the first artist so honored by University of California. The Library of Congress established a Special Collection of his work in 1998.

His nearly 150 compositions to date are published exclusively by the C. F. Peters Corporation, and several dozen CDs and DVDs of his work have been commercially released in the US and Europe. Performances by the Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego Symphonies, among others, preceded the most recent large-scale work, &quot;george WASHINGTON&quot;, written in honor of America&#x27;s first president. This work knits together the Reynolds&#x27;s career-long interest in orchestra, text, extended musical forms, intermedia, and computer spatialization of sound.

Reynolds&#x27;s work embodies an American artistic idealism reflecting the influence of Varèse and Cage, as well as Xenakis, and has also been compared with that of Boulez and Scelsi. Reynolds lives with his partner of 59 years, Karen, in Del Mar, California, overlooking the Pacific.

====Early influences: piano studies with Kenneth Aiken (1934–1952)====

The seeds for Reynolds&#x27;s focus on music were planted almost by accident when his father, an architect, recommended that he purchase some phonograph records. These recordings, including a Vladimir Horowitz performance of Frédéric Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Polonaise in A-flat Major, Op. 53&quot;, spurred Reynolds to take up piano lessons with Kenneth Aiken. Aiken demanded that his students delve into the cultural context behind the works of classic keyboard literature they played. Around the time that Reynolds graduated from high school in 1952, he performed a solo recital in Detroit that consisted of the Johannes Brahms &quot;Piano Sonata No. 3 in F minor, Op. 5&quot;, some &quot;Intermezzi&quot;, the Franz Liszt &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 6&quot;, as well as works by Claude Debussy, and Chopin. Reynolds remembers:
I don&#x27;t recall public performance as being a particularly enjoyable experience. It served to bring what I cared about in music much closer than did mere phonographic idylls, but I did not, could not, feel that what was happening as I played was actually mine. It was not the applause that interested me, but the experience of the music itself.

====University of Michigan: Engineering Physics (1952–1957)====

Reynolds was uncertain about his prospects as a professional pianist, and entered the University of Michigan to study engineering physics, in line with his father&#x27;s expectations. During what would be his first stint at the University of Michigan, he stayed connected to music and the arts because of the &quot;virtual melting pot of disciplinary aspirations that then engaged him.&quot; Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; and James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; both left marks upon his perception of music and the arts. &quot;I ... consumed [Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Portrait&quot;] hungrily, stayed in my dormitory room for weeks, feverish over the allure of its issues, not attending classes and only narrowly escaping academic disaster...&quot;. Reynolds received a B.S.E. in physics from the University of Michigan in 1957.

====Systems Development Engineer and Military Policeman====

After completing his undergraduate studies, he went to work in the missile industry for Marquardt Corporation. He moved to the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, and worked as a systems development engineer. However, he quickly found that he was spending an inordinate amount of time practicing piano, and decided to go back to school to study music, with the goal of becoming a small liberal arts college teacher.

But prior to returning to school, Reynolds had a one-year obligation as a reservist in the military, which he fulfilled after his short time at Marquardt. As he recalls:
Knowing that I was an engineer, I presumed I would have been an Army engineer. But in fact my MSOs (military service obligations) were either light-truck driver or military policeman. So I chose military policeman, and I learned how to disable people and how to be extraordinarily brutal. It was a rather strange experience.

====Return to University of Michigan: encounter with Ross Lee Finney====

Reynolds returned to Ann Arbor in 1957, prepared to commit himself to life as a pianist. He was quickly diverted from this path upon encountering resident composer Ross Lee Finney, who introduced Reynolds to composition. Reynolds took a composition for non-composers class with Finney. At the end of the semester, Reynolds&#x27; string trio was performed for the class. According to Reynolds,
Finney just decimated it. ... I mean, everything about it, he destroyed. The sounds, the time, the pitches, the form, everything was wrong. I was chastened. 
Despite the harsh introduction, Finney pulled Reynolds aside after the performance and recommended that he study composition with him over the summer. These summer lessons proved to be brutal. But when Reynolds was nearly ready to quit, at the end of the summer, Finney responded positively to what he brought in. Reynolds was engrossed by composing music, but he was still unsure what it meant to be a composer in America. He recalls that summer:
Although the process was by no means a smooth or an immediately encouraging one, by the time regular classes resumed in the fall of 1960 I was twenty-six, and I knew that I would do everything I could to become a composer. What did that actually mean? I have no recollection now of having had the slightest sense of what the life of a composer in America might involve.

Finney was particularly generous to Reynolds, programming three of his pieces on a Midwest Composers Symposium, something &quot;unheard of&quot; for student works. At these Midwest Composers Symposia, Reynolds also first encountered Harvey Sollberger, who would become a lifelong colleague and friend. From Finney, Reynolds learned of &quot;the primacy of &#x27;gesture,&#x27; which [Reynolds] took to be a composite of rhythm, contour, and physical energy: the empathic resonances that musical ideas could arouse — at root, perhaps, an American tendency to value sensation over analysis.&quot;

====Composition studies with Roberto Gerhard====

Subsequently, when the Spanish expatriate composer Roberto Gerhard came to Ann Arbor, Reynolds gravitated towards him:
I was captivated by the uncommon dimensionality of this man. Not only was he a superb musician and an inventive, even commanding composer of uncluttered, poised, and original music, but he was also both deeply intelligent and emotionally vulnerable. His susceptibility to injury, the outrage he displayed at ethical injustices, the touching warmth he offered from behind a vestigial Spanish crustiness these made an irresistible combination.
From Gerhard, Reynolds absorbed the idea that composition took &quot;the whole man... you must put everything that you have and everything that you are into every musical act. And so where I live, who I interact with, what I hear, what the weather’s like, what my granddaughter says to me, and so on, they all affect the music.&quot;

====Other early encounters; degrees conferred====

During the later part of his composition studies at the University of Michigan, Reynolds also sought out encounters with other prominent musical personalities, including Milton Babbitt, Edgard Varèse, Nadia Boulanger, John Cage, and Harry Partch. Reynolds sought these composers outside of his academic studies:
It was outside class that I came upon and dug into the implications of Ives, Cage, Varèse and Partch. I sought out the last three and had personal contact with them. Perhaps it was the feeling of, if not exactly forbidden, then, certainly, &quot;not favored&quot; fruit that caused them to loom so large for me. 
Reynolds met with Partch in 1958 in Yellow Springs, Ohio, at Antioch College, where he encountered a characteristic Antioch commandment: &quot;&#x27;Examine your basic assumptions.&#x27;&quot; Reynolds notes that such examination did not imply abandoning those assumptions.

During 1960, Reynolds met with both Varèse and Cage in New York (and the latter again in 1961 in Ann Arbor), with Babbitt in Ann Arbor in 1960, and with Nadia Boulanger in Ann Arbor in 1961.

During this time, Reynolds also composed &quot;The Emperor of Ice Cream&quot; (1961-1962), which combined aspects of music and theater, and contained many of the features of his later music. It was composed for the ONCE festivals, but was actually premiered later, in 1965, in Rome.

Reynolds received a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in music in 1960 and an M.Mus. in composition in 1961.

====ONCE Festivals 1961–1963====

Reynolds co-founded the ONCE Group in Ann Arbor with Robert Ashley and Gordon Mumma, and was active in the first three festivals in 1961 to 1963. Other important figures in these festivals included George Cacioppo, Donald Scavarda, Bruce Wise, filmmaker George Manupelli, and later, &quot;Blue&quot; Gene Tyranny. The ONCE Festival was probably the most significant nexus of avant-garde performance art and music in the Midwest in the early 1960s, with programs consisting of both American Experimentalism and European Modernism. Reynolds recalls:

I think the primary force in the beginning was Bob and Mary Ashley. Bob had been studying at the University of Michigan with Ross Finney. ... [Ashley] had [previously] been at the Manhattan School of Music; he was a pianist at that time. He was very intense and very rebellious in some regards. [Gordon] Mumma had been at Michigan but had dropped out and was working in some kind of research dealing with seismographic measurement... The two of them had become involved with a [visual] art professor named Milton Cohen, who had what he called a Space Theatre where he had taken canvas and stretched it to make a circular, tent-like situation ... in the middle there were projectors and mirrors which flashed imagery on the [surrounding] screens. Bob and Gordon had been involved in making electronic music in relation to Cohen’s [Space Theatre]. ...they realized that if they started a festival, they were going to need resources... I think that I came into the picture partly in that way. ... So there was a confluence of capacity, differential abilities, and common interest.

In 1963, C.F. Peters offered to publish Reynolds&#x27;s work, a relationship which has been exclusive since that day.

===Early career: travels abroad and to California (1962–1969)===

====Europe: Germany, France and Italy====

After he left Ann Arbor the second time, Reynolds traveled throughout Europe with his partner Karen, a flutist. They visited Germany, France and then Italy with Fulbright, Guggenheim and Rockefeller support. This sojourn to Europe served as a way for Reynolds to find his voice as a composer:

The idea was to get out and to have the time to do the kind of growing that I thought I needed to do, because I had composed very few pieces by the time I had graduated from the University of Michigan. So at that time, although it seems odd now, going to Europe was a way of living cheaply. I lived in Europe for almost three years on nothing and with nothing, and that time was spent trying to find myself and my voice.

It emerged later that Philip Glass was in Paris during a similar period and living in the same way.

Before Paris, Reynolds had gone to Germany to study with Bernd Alois Zimmermann in Cologne, on a Fulbright Scholarship in 1962/1963. But things did not turn out the way he expected:

 I was supposed to study with Zimmermann. I went to his class. And afterwards he took me to coffee and he said, “Look, there&#x27;s no point for you to be in this class.” He didn&#x27;t say why but he said, “Just do what you want, come back and see me at the end, and I&#x27;ll sign off.” So I actually never met with him, never had a lesson with him, never even had a conversation with him.

Instead, Reynolds worked with Gottfried Michael Koenig, and collaborated with Michael von Biel, who was living in the atelier of Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s friend Mary Bauermeister. Reynolds worked at the West German Radio&#x27;s Electronic Music Studio, where he completed &quot;A Portrait of Vanzetti&quot; (1963)

The following academic year, 1963-1964, Karen received a Fulbright to study in Paris, although, ironically, one of the most influential moments during that year for Reynolds was in Berlin. He and Karen traveled there to meet Elliott Carter, and heard his &quot;Double Concerto&quot; while there. Reynolds was particularly struck by the spatial elements in the piece. This influenced his own composition &quot;Quick Are the Mouths of Earth&quot; (1964–1965).

Throughout their years in Europe, despite their lack of funding, Roger and Karen curated and performed in several contemporary music concerts in Paris and Italy.

====Japan====

Reynolds accepted a fellowship from the Institute of Current World Affairs, which took him and Karen to Japan from 1966 to 1969. In Japan the Reynoldses organized the intermedia series CROSS TALK INTERMEDIA, which in 1969 culminated in a three-day festival in Kenzo Tangei&#x27;s Olympic Gymnasium. He also met and became friends with composers Toru Takemitsu, Joji Yuasa, pianist Yūji Takahashi, electronics specialist Junosuke Okuyama, critic Kuniharu Akiyama, painter Keiji Usami and theatre director Tadashi Suzuki.

Reynolds&#x27; most significant work from his time in Japan was probably PING (1968), a multimedia composition for piano, flute, percussion, harmonium, live electronic sound, film, and visual effects, based on a text by Samuel Beckett. For the work he collaborated with Butoh dancer Sekiji Maro, cinematographer Kazuro Kato, who had previously worked as a cameraman for Akira Kurosawa, and Karen, who devised a strategy for projecting the Beckett text.

====California====

Roger and Karen were visiting the Seattle Symphony during 1965 with sponsorship from the Rockefeller Foundation. A trip down the West Coast to visit various university music programs was suggested by the foundation&#x27;s Arts Officer, Howard Klein. The last stop on that trip was at the still young University of California, San Diego campus, in La Jolla. The nascent music life at this University was viewed with much promise:

We thought that the most dynamic social scene at that point – this was the late ’60s – was California, and so that&#x27;s where we went [when returning to the U.S.]. But there was not much in San Diego at that time. It was primarily a Navy town. There was a fledgling unit of the University of California ... it was an open playing field, so the possibility of doing things was very great. ... Partch was [also] in San Diego. That wasn&#x27;t a reason to go there, but it was certainly an attraction after we got there.

===University of California, San Diego (1969–present)===

Several years after their visit to La Jolla, Will Ogdon, then UCSD&#x27;s Department of Music chair, invited the Reynolds back to the area, offering Reynolds a position as a tenured associate professor. He began work on establishing what became the Center for Music Experiment and Related Research in 1971, an organized research unit that later evolved into the Center for Research in Computing and the Arts. As was the case with the San Francisco Tape Music Center, the initial funding for CME came from the Rockefeller Foundation.

While at UCSD, Reynolds has taught courses on Music Notation, Extended Vocal Techniques, Late Beethoven Works, Text (in relation to the Red Act Project and Greek Drama), Collaboration (co-taught with Steven Schick), Extending Varèse (also co-taught with Steven Schick), and the Perils of Large Scale Form (co-taught with Chinary Ung), musical analysis, as well as private and group composition lessons.

After his arrival at the University of California, his interests diverged into several concurrently evolving paths. Thus, it is easier to talk about his work from this point based on common features between works.

===Work===

Reynolds has addressed the European musical tradition with three symphonies, four concertos and five string quartets, works that have been performed internationally as well as in North America.

====Influence of technology====

Aside from the traditional instruments of the Western Classical orchestra, Reynolds worked extensively with analog and digital electronic sound, typically employed to bolster the form and timbral richness of his works.

====CCRMA====

In the late 1970s, John Chowning invited Reynolds to come to Stanford&#x27;s summer courses at the Center for Computing Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA). Because of the expense of computer equipment, electroacoustic work was done very differently at that time:
...[W]hen I went to Stanford to start working in computers at the end of the ’70s, I worked with a lot of different people there who were around the lab, because this was at a time when the so-called time-sharing machines meant that everyone in the building heard what everyone else was doing and everyone was involved with everyone else. So if something wasn&#x27;t working you just asked the person sitting next to you [for help] and you&#x27;d work it out together.
At CCRMA, Reynolds finished the sound synthesis portion of &quot;...the serpent-snapping eye...&quot; (1978) (uses FM Synthesis) and &quot;VOICESPACE IV: The Palace&quot; (1978–80) (uses digital signal processing).

====IRCAM====

Shortly after his involvement at CCRMA, the French Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM) offered Reynolds a commission and residency, which was followed up by two more residences over the course of two decades. When he first went to IRCAM, he made the choice to utilize technologically expert assistants to create software or hardware solutions to specific musical ideas inherent in his compositions. This practice has since spawned many collaborative ventures with various musical assistants, as Reynolds notes:
When I went to IRCAM ... there was this concept of the Musical Assistant. ... I realized right away that this allowed me to make a choice: whether I would decide to spend a few years not composing and learning what I would need to do to become a self-sufficient computer-music composer or that I was going to collaborate with other people.
[On collaboration:] You enter into a relationship with one or more people and you have to sacrifice some of your autonomy and they have to sacrifice some of theirs in order to get to a place that you couldn’t get without each other. And I like that kind of situation.

&quot;Archipelago&quot; (1982–83) was one of the first works that Reynolds did that used technology to drastically alter not only the sounds of the composition, but also the process of composing. The impetus was as the title suggests, a chain of islands, an idea which Reynolds elaborated on with a layered theme and variations process. With fifteen themes and their own variations, distributed unevenly over sub-groups of a thirty-two member chamber orchestra, Reynolds needed technology to transform both the timbres and the intricate fragmentation and reordering of the sounds in ways that live performers could not. This was the first time that Reynolds spent extended periods of time working with computers to transform musical material, along with spatialization. IRCAM was an extremely fertile environment for compositional innovation, allowing the &quot;Archipelago&quot; project to thrive:
...[T]he process [of composing the piece] was interactive because I was at IRCAM and had the privilege of working with a very smart young composer, Thierry Lancino, who was my musical assistant, and also consulting with people like David Wessel and Stephen McAdams and so on. It was an astonishing opportunity. But in this case, the tie between the impetus, the medium, and the need for technology was absolutely clear. If one listens to the piece, one hears that [technology] was needed and also that it works.
&quot;Odyssey&quot; (1989–93), primarily composed during the early 1990s, incorporates two singers, two speakers, instrumental ensemble, and six-channel computer sound. &quot;Odyssey required me to settle on an ideal set of multilingual Beckett texts by means of which to portray the course of his life.&quot; There was a chaotic element in the text that Reynolds wished to portray in the music, and he undertook some of the first experiments with using strange attractors (specifically the Lorenz attractor) in music with this composition, citing influence from James Gleick. Reynolds notes that the process of creating musically beguiling results from a strange attractor was &quot;arduous&quot; and &quot;grueling.&quot;

His last work at IRCAM, &quot;The Angel of Death&quot; (1998–2001), for solo piano, chamber orchestra, and 6-channel computer processed sound, was written with a substantial number of perceptual psychologists assisting and analyzing both the planning and the end results. His assistant on the project was Frédérique Voisin, and the principal psychologists were Steven McAdams (IRCAM) and Emannuel Bigand (University of Bourgone). The end results included a special issue of the journal &quot;Music Perception&quot;, edited by Daniel Levitin, an audio CD / CDROM publication by IRCAM, along with a day-long conference in Sydney, Australia.

====UPIC (1983–84)====

Shortly after his first trip to IRCAM, he was also invited to compose a work using the Les Ateliers UPIC System, which Iannis Xenakis had created for &quot;Mycenae Alpha&quot; (1978). This engagement resulted in &quot;Ariadne&#x27;s Thread&quot; for string quartet and UPIC sound.

====SANCTUARY (2003–07)====

A composer-in-residence appointment at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (at UCSD) allowed Reynolds to finish his SANCTUARY project: an evening-length, four-movement piece for percussion quartet and real-time computer transformations. The completed work was premiered in 2007 at I.M. Pei’s National Gallery of Art, and later the same year repeated in the courtyard of the Salk Institute in La Jolla. The DVD that arose from this project was intended to alter the way contemporary classical music is received, because of the intimacy with which the performers knew the work and the audio-visual complexity with which it was presented. Steven Schick and red fish blue fish had been working on the piece for five years by the time the DVD was recorded. Ross Karre prepared a complexly scripted editing plan. The embodied experience that such intimacy breeds is very important to Reynolds:
A lot of our experience with music is empathic – that is, we, our bodies, our sensibilities, identify with and respond to, even literally move with the physicality of the sounds that are generating the musical experience. ... [The immersion of the performers in a work] allows our empathy as listeners to flow out and extend and commit. We see that the performers are really engaged and we get engaged; we trust them.

====imAge/imagE====

Around 2000, Reynolds began writing a series of short, complementary solos, entitled, for example, &quot;imagE/guitar&quot; and &quot;imAge/guitar.&quot; The “E” is more elegiac and evocative, the “A”, assertive and angular. As his interest in algorithmic transformation migrated towards real-time performance interaction, Reynolds produced a series of extended compositions using the materials of a solo pair as his thematic resource. &quot;Dream Mirror&quot;, for guitar and computer musician, is a duo whose internal sections are framed by completely notated music, but move into a collaboratively improvisational interaction within these frames.

The improvisatory interactions are algorithmically driven, with the soloist and computer musician interacting flexibly, but under well-defined conditions. Both &quot;Dream Mirror&quot;, for guitarist Pablo Gómez-Cano, and &quot;MARKed MUSIC&quot;,
for contrabassist Mark Dresser, involved close collaboration with computer musician, Jaime Oliver. &quot;Toward Another World: LAMENT&quot; for clarinet and computer musician, as well as similar duos involving violin (&quot;Shifting/Drifting&quot;) and cello (&quot;PERSISTENCE&quot;) followed.

When composing &quot;Shifting/Drifting&quot;, Reynolds worked closely with his frequent violin collaborator Irvine Arditti on the acoustic material, and computer musician Paul Hembree on the electronic sound. The French classical music periodical Diapason (magazine) described the piece as: &quot;Un espace aussi artificiel que vaste apporte une sensation de distance et de perspective assez vertigineuse. Le rendu sonore global frappe par l’expansion du lyrisme et d’une virtuosité violonistique qui prend en quelque sorte racine chez Bach (la Chaconne de la Partita no 2 fait d’ailleurs une apparition masquée)...&quot; (English: A space as artificial as it is vast brings a rather dizzying sensation of distance and perspective. The overall sound rendering is striking by the expansion of lyricism and a violin virtuosity which takes root, in a way, in Bach (the Chaconne from Partita no. 2 also makes a hidden appearance)...)

====Influence of literature and poetry====

Text has been an important resource for Reynolds&#x27;s work, in particular, the poetry of Beckett, Borges, Stevens, and John Ashbery. Since the mid-1970s he has been engaged with the use of language as sound, &quot;the ways in which a vocalist&#x27;s manner of utterance – whether spoken, declaimed, sung, or indebted to some uncommon mode of production&quot; affect the experience of the ideas that the text carries. Reynolds was stimulated by his UCSD colleagues Kenneth Gaburo and baritone Philip Larson, deploying extended vocal techniques, such as &quot;vocal-fry&quot; in the VOICESPACE works (quadraphonic tape compositions): &quot;Still&quot; (1975), &quot;A Merciful Coincidence&quot; (1976), &quot;Eclipse&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Palace&quot; (1980). The VOICESPACE works also involve the intricate spatialization of both the voices and computer-generated sounds.

While serving as Valentine Visiting Professor at Amherst College in the late 1980s, Reynolds immersed himself in poetry because of the connection of Amherst with poet Emily Dickinson. He came across John Ashbery&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait a Convex Mirror&quot; (1974) while reading one evening:
The next morning I realized that things that I had understood the night before I couldn&#x27;t understand the next morning. In other words, there was something time specific about comprehension. ... That was very interesting. What usually happens when something like that occurs is that I want to write music about it, and so I decided to do a string orchestra piece. This string orchestra piece, &quot;Whispers Out of Time&quot;, was premiered in 1988 in Amherst, and won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1989. Reynolds later worked collaboratively with John Ashbery on the seventy-minute song cycle &quot;last things, I think, to think about&quot; (1994), which uses a spatialized recording of the poet speaking.

====Influence of visual arts====

Visual art has provided Reynolds with inspiration for several works, such as the &quot;Symphony [The Stages of Life]&quot; (1991–92), which drew from self-portraits by Rembrandt and Picasso, and &quot;Visions&quot; (1991), a string quartet that responded to Bruegel. A later project involving visual art was &quot;The Image Machine&quot; (2005), which arose from rather elaborate interdisciplinary collaboration called &quot;22&quot;, headed by Thanassis Rikakis, then at Arizona State University. This large-scale work involved motion capture of a dancer, to be used as a control element:
At the center of this project was the idea that it would be possible to capture the complex motion [of a dancer] in real time, and to have a computer model and then monitor the motion in such a way that it could send control information to other artists who would create parallel and deeply responsive elements to a larger performance totality.
Reynolds worked with choreographer Bill T. Jones, clarinetist Anthony Burr, and percussionist Steven Schick on the project, along with audio software designers Pei Xiang and Peter Otto, and visual rendering artists Paul Kaiser, Shelley Eshkar, and Marc Downie. The process was not necessarily tranquil, though it was rewarding, as Reynolds recalls:
We achieved a meld of media, high technology, and aesthetic force unequaled by anything else I had experienced. The process was not smooth. In fact it was sometimes destructively rancorous. None-the-less, the product of long effort and mutual adjustment, one component resource to the other, showed vividly and thrillingly what one of art&#x27;s futures might be.
Among the audio software resources created for &quot;22&quot; was MATRIX, a new algorithm designed by Reynolds which he has used since on various projects.

====Influence of mythology====

Myth has been an important resource for Reynolds&#x27;s work, as evident in the title of his second symphony: &quot;Symphony [Myths]&quot; (1990). Later, this mythological preoccupation grew into the Red Act Project, the first installment of which was commissioned by the British Broadcasting Corporation. This piece, &quot;The Red Act Arias,&quot; was premiered at the 1997 Proms, animating text from Aeschylus with narrator, choir, orchestra and eight channel electronic sound. Perhaps the most powerful impression any narrative text has ever left on me, though, is that inscribed by Aeschylus in &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, the first play of the &quot;Oresteia&quot; trilogy. Again, there is an intersection of intellectual implication, moving narrative, associations through imagery and oppositions that is magnetic. Nevertheless, it is the flow of the language itself as rendered into English by Richmond Lattimore that cemented my resolve to embark upon the Red Act Project. I [was] engaged with it for more than a decade.
Responding to related texts, Reynolds produced &quot;Justice&quot; (1999-2001), commissioned by the Library of Congress, and &quot;Illusion&quot; (2006), commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic with funding from the Koussevitsky and Rockefeller foundations.

====Space: metaphoric, auditory, architectural====

Reynolds has been involved with the concept of Space as a potential musical resource for most of his career, leading to a reputation that rests, in part, upon his “wizardry in sending music flying through space: whether vocal, instrumental, or computerized”. This signature feature first appeared in the notationally innovative theater piece, &quot;The Emperor of Ice-Cream&quot; (1961–62). In this work, Reynolds sought to bring conceptual elements in the text to the fore with the aid of spatial movement of sound.

I began my own efforts to address space in modest fashion, in a music-theater composition &quot;[The Emperor of Ice Cream]&quot; intended for the ONCE Festivals but not actually premiered until 1965 in the context of the Nuova Consonanza Festival of Franco Evangelisti&#x27;s, in Rome. ... So, in the case of [Wallace] Stevens&#x27;s line &quot;And spread it so as to cover her face,&quot; the eight singers, arrayed across the front of the stage, pass the phonemes of the associated melodic phrase back and forth by fading in and out successively.

Later, in Japan, Reynolds worked with engineer Junosuke Okuyama to build a &quot;photo-cell sound distributor,&quot; which used a matrix of photoelectric cells to move sounds around a quadraphonic setup, with the aid of a flashlight as a kind of controller. This device was used in the multimedia composition PING (1968). More recently, Reynolds&#x27;s Mode Records &quot;Watershed&quot; (1998) DVD was the first such disc to feature music conceived specifically for discrete multichannel presentation in Dolby Digital 5.1.

I wrote a piece, &quot;Watershed IV&quot;, for percussionist Steven Schick, which involved the very fundamental conceit that he was centered within an instrumental array. The idea was that the audience would be put in there with him, metaphorically. There would be speakers surrounding the audience that would reproduce, at some level, for the listener, the experience that Steve was having within his array of instruments. Steve and I worked almost a year on the setup for that piece, playing with different spiral arrangements and numbers of instruments and different geometries.

He is concerned not only with the physical locations of sound sources around a listener, but also metaphoric notions of space. As he notes, &quot;&#x27;Space&#x27; can signify a physical framework by means of which we comprehend the conditions of the &#x27;real world&#x27; around us, but it can also become a referential tool that helps us to place into relative and often revelatory relationships other less objectively characterizable data.&quot;

In addition to the auditory effects of spatial location and metaphoric notions of space, Reynolds has responded to various architectural spaces, creating works explicitly for performance in various buildings, including Arata Isozaki&#x27;s Art Tower Mito and also his Gran Ship, Kenzō Tange&#x27;s Olympic Gymnasium in Tokyo, Louis I. Kahn&#x27;s Salk Institute, Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Guggenheim Museum, Christian de Portzamparc&#x27;s Cité de la Musique, Frank Gehry&#x27;s Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Royal Albert Hall, and the Great Hall of the Library of Congress, the Kennedy Center, I.M. Pei&#x27;s East Wing of the National Gallery of Art. Reynolds adapts his use of spatial audio to the performance space.

Gradually it became clear that blunter tools can work to greater advantage in large spaces with comparatively larger audiences. In composing &quot;The Red Act Arias&quot; for performance in London&#x27;s cavernous, 6,000-seat Royal Albert Hall, for example, I decided to use a multileveled system with eight groups of loudspeakers. Rather than attempting to position sounds precisely on perceivable paths around the hall, I concentrated on broad, sweeping gestures that surged across or around the performance space in unmistakable fashion.

====Other series of works====

From the 1970s, when he produced the five VOICESPACE works, Reynolds has been interested in generating series of related works. He has performed multiple presentations of PASSAGE events (involving the reading and spatialization of original texts, projected images, and live performances), composed seven complementary pairs of imagE/ and imAge/ solo works, and, most recently, six works belonging to the “SHARESPACE” series of duos for individual instruments and computer musicians.

====Mentorship, research and writing====

In addition to his compositional activities, Reynolds&#x27;s academic career has taken him to Europe, the Nordic countries, South America, Asia, Mexico and the United States, where he has lectured, organized events, and taught. Though his focus has been on the Music Department at UCSD, Reynolds has occupied visiting positions at various universities: the University of Illinois (Champaign–Urbana, IL, Spring 1971), CUNY-Brooklyn College (Spring 1985), the Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University, Yale University (Spring 1982), Amherst College (Fall 1988), and at Harvard University as Fromm Visiting Professor (Fall 2013). In his role as a UC University Professor, Reynolds was artist-in-residence and taught courses at University of California, Washington Center, the University of California’s Washington, DC campus (2010–2015).

At the University of Illinois, Reynolds wrote his first book, &quot;Mind Models: New Forms of Musical Experience&quot; (1975). It covers a wide range of topics concerning the contemporary world and the role of art in that world, specific considerations of the materials of music, and the way those materials are shaped by contemporary composers.

At the time that &quot;Mind Models&quot; first appeared in print, no one else had attempted to rigorously define the issues raised by those composers who broke most deliberately with traditional European practice. ... Reynolds was the first to clearly identify and consolidate into a single framework the vast array of forces (cultural, political, perceptual, and technical) shaping this heterogeneous body of work. 

Reynolds wrote &quot;A Searcher&#x27;s Path&quot; (1987) while serving as visiting professor at CUNY – Brooklyn College, and &quot;Form and Method: Composing Music&quot; while serving as Randolph Rothschild Guest Composer at the Peabody Conservatory of Johns Hopkins University. The later closely details Reynolds&#x27;s compositional process. In addition to his books, he has written articles for periodicals including &quot;Perspectives of New Music&quot;, the &quot;Contemporary Music Review&quot;, &quot;Polyphone&quot;, &quot;Inharmoniques&quot;, &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot;, &quot;American Music&quot;, &quot;Music Perception&quot;, and &quot;Nature&quot;.

Most recently, Reynolds completed the monograph &quot;Xenakis Creates in Architecture and Music: The Reynolds Desert House&quot; (2022), working with his wife Karen Reynolds to describe how Xenakis designed an unbuilt but fully-planned house for the Reynolds family in the Anza Borrego desert.

In addition to visiting positions, Reynolds has also given master classes around the world, in places such as Buenos Aires, Thessaloniki, Porto Alegre, IRCAM, Warsaw, the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki, and the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Furthermore, he has been a featured composer at numerous music festivals, including Music Today and the Suntory International Program in Japan, the Edinburgh and Proms festivals in the United Kingdom, the Helsinki and Zagreb biennales, the Darmstädter Ferienkurse, New Music Concerts (Toronto), Warsaw Autumn, Why Note? (Dijon), musica viva (Munich), the Agora Festival (Paris), various ISCM festivals, and the New York Philharmonic&#x27;s Horizons.

<text>North Pyongan Province (also spelled North P&#x27;yŏngan; ; ) is a western province of North Korea. The province was formed in 1896 from the northern half of the former P&#x27;yŏng&#x27;an Province, remained a province of Korea until 1945, then became a province of North Korea. Its capital is Sinŭiju. In 2002, Sinŭiju Special Administrative Region—near the city of Sinuiju—was established as a separately governed Special Administrative Region.

==Geography==
The Yalu River forms the northern border with China&#x27;s Liaoning province. The province is also bordered to the east by Chagang Province and to the south by South Pyong&#x27;an Province. The Sinŭiju Special Administrative Region is located in the western corner of the province, and was created as an administrative entity separate from North Pyongan in 2002. North Pyongan is surrounded by water to the west with the Korea Bay and the Yellow Sea.

==Administrative divisions==
North Pyongan is divided into 3 cities (&quot;si&quot;) and 22 counties (&quot;kun&quot;). Each entity is listed below in English, Chosŏn&#x27;gŭl, and Hancha.

<doc id="390208" wikidata="Q6089705" url="?curid=390208" title="It's Academic">
<text>It&#x27;s Academic is the name for a number of televised academic student quiz shows for high school students through the United States and internationally. &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; programs have notably aired on NBC-owned WRC-TV (and, as of October 29, 2022, exclusively on PBS member station WETA-TV) in Washington, D.C., NBC affiliate WVIR-TV in Charlottesville, Virginia, and CBS-owned WJZ-TV in Baltimore, Maryland.

The Washington, D.C. version of the show has been on the air since October 7, 1961, and is recognized by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest-running quiz program in TV history. The program was created for WRC by Sophie Altman, who continued as executive producer until her death on May 24, 2008. Mac McGarry hosted the Washington shows from the beginning until June 25, 2011. Hillary Howard, formerly a news anchor for Washington radio station WTOP-FM, took over as host subsequent to McGarry&#x27;s official retirement in November 2011. The program is sponsored by philanthropist investor David Rubenstein and by the McLean, Virginia-based Mitre Corporation.

==Format==
The single-elimination tournament features 81 schools in the Washington metropolitan area, 81 schools in the Baltimore metropolitan area (including Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore), and nine schools in the Central Virginia region. The winners in each region go on to battle each other in the Super Bowl.

Each contest is composed of five rounds. Round 1 is a category round with eight themed questions (e.g. &quot;the letter B&quot; or &quot;famous paintings&quot;). Questions do not appear on the players&#x27; monitors but do appear for the home viewers. Each team is given 100 points before this round and teams receive 10 points for each correct answer and lose 10 for each incorrect answer.

In Round 2, each team is individually asked five questions and receive 20 points each for a correct answer, but do not lose points for an incorrect answer.

Round 3 is a toss-up visual round. The monitor displays an image and the host provides a question accompanying the image. Teams receive 20 points for each correct answer and lose 20 for each incorrect answer (10 until April 19, 2014 in Washington, Baltimore, and starting with the 2014 season in Charlottesville; other cities&#x27; visual rounds are still 10 points up or down). Eight questions are used. The fourth question is always a math question.

Before Round 4 the captain of each team introduces the sponsors and school administrators and coaches. Teams then select from three question packets. The team to the immediate left of the team that is supposed to answer chooses which packet the answering team will use. Eight questions are given to each team, with 20 points for a correct answer and no penalties. A 25-point bonus is given if a team correctly answers all eight questions, for a total of 185 points in this round. The fourth question is always a science question and the seventh question is always a math question (data from both those questions are displayed on the monitor or team&#x27;s screen).

Round 5 features quick-fire toss-up questions, each worth +/-20 points. Visual questions are worth +/-30 points. The number of questions varies depending on the time left in the game. The game ends when the buzzer sounds, home viewers may realize that the game will come to a close while the countdown clock appears on the television screen. If a team has buzzed in prior the buzzer sounding, the team is required to answer the question before the game is considered over. If there is a tie in the knockout round (e.g. the final), the presenter may ask one last tie-breaker question to determine the winner.

After the host has announced the teams&#x27; final scores, the studio audience is invited down from the stands to join the contestants on camera during the closing credit sequence. In the Washington version from about 1976 to June 2017, the song heard under the credit roll (if there are no musicians from any of the competing schools) was &quot;T.L.C. (Tender Loving Care)&quot; by the band MFSB (a new theme was introduced in Washington for the 2017–18 season, entitled &quot;Just Let Go&quot;, by Marti Amado and Ron Bolton, music production by Network Music which is used throughout the show).

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Washington, D.C., later episodes in the 2019–2020 season were played in a remote format, with teams in separate locations, and without buzzers. Teams were recorded separately, and were not aware of other teams&#x27; scores. The competition will return to the studio in late winter/early spring 2023.

===Discontinued rounds===
Prior to the adoption of the current format, there were several other formats of play.

====Category round====
The &quot;very fast&quot; category round consisted of questions pertaining to the same category. In some cases, the question was the same throughout the round: teams were given different items, and had to answer the common question on the basis of each item (e.g., given a state, name either senator from that state). In other cases, all the answers in the category round shared an announced characteristic in common (e.g., geographical locations whose names begin and end with &quot;A&quot;). Teams used their buzzers in this round, earning 10 points for a correct answer, but losing 10 points (later 20 points) for wrong answers.

====Timed round====
In all forms, a team individually answers questions from a packet within a time limit. In one form, at the beginning of the game, teams get one minute to answer questions for 20 points each. In this form, teams are not penalized for wrong answers, in order to help the teams in &quot;building score&quot;. In another form, teams have one and a half minutes to answer questions for 20 points each. However, 20 points are deducted for a wrong answer. Teams may pass a question, losing 10 points; however, the other two teams may buzz-in to answer the passed questions (with a few exceptions) for plus or minus 20 points after the time runs out for the team&#x27;s turn. Every question that is fully read must be answered or passed within a reasonable time. However, if a question is not finished when time expires, the team may reject it without penalty or answer the question at their own risk. In this form, getting all 10 questions (later eight) correct originally earned the team a 50-point bonus, later reduced to 25.

====Scrimmage round====
A &quot;scrimmage round&quot; was once used during the 1977–78 Buffalo season championship, as well as in Washington and Baltimore through much of the 1970s, and also in Cleveland at about that time. Teams were instructed to &quot;use [their] lights and buzzers&quot; for a &quot;one-minute scrimmage round.&quot; 10 points were scored for a correct answer, with no penalties.

An Australian version of the show aired on Network 10 and the Seven Network from 1968 to 1975, and was revived by Seven&#x27;s Perth affiliate in 2001. Seven took the show national in 2005.

A New Zealand version was also screened by TVNZ in the 1980s, with Lockwood Smith and John Hayden as hosts.

WNBC in New York aired a local edition of &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; from September 15, 1963 through July 1, 1972, hosted most of the time by Art James, with Lee Leonard filling in for a year.

WMAQ-TV in Chicago had a version in the 1960s and 1970s under the &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; name, hosted by Ed Grennan. The show debuted on September 29, 1962, with Arlington High School facing off against Homewood-Flossmoor High School.

WLWT, WCPO-TV and WCET in Cincinnati aired a local &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; from October 13, 1963 to May 30, 1982. The Cincinnati hosts included Dave Manning, Lloyd Baldwin, Steve Douglas and Claire Slemmer.

A version of &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; aired on CBS affiliate WBEN-TV in Buffalo from January 27, 1968 through 1986. Initially hosted by National Football League Hall of Fame radio broadcaster of the Buffalo Bills, Van Miller, the first season concluded on April 20, 1968. The show was later revived for a few months in 2008 by NBC affiliate WGRZ, with Kevin O&#x27;Neill as host. The show returned to the area starting January 12, 2013 and was hosted by O&#x27;Neill and produced by Full Circle Studios for broadcast on WGRZ.

A show using the &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; name aired in Richmond, Virginia on the NBC affiliate, WWBT Channel 12, from November 22, 1975 to June 26, 1976 (the Richmond championship aired on May 16, 1976), which was also hosted by Mac McGarry and sponsored by Giant. That was replaced by &quot;Battle of the Brains&quot;. &quot;Battle of the Brains&quot; has also replaced a version of &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; that aired in Hampton Roads.

The World Affairs Council, in conjunction with the United States Department of State, hosted an &quot;It&#x27;s Academic International&quot; event in 2002, also hosted by Mac McGarry.

KHII-TV in Honolulu aired a local version titled &quot;It&#x27;s Academic Hawaii&quot; hosted by Billy V (from Hawaii News Now-Sunrise). It was previously hosted by Rick Hamada and Keahi Tucker.

WEWS in Cleveland has had a version of the series since 1964. It was originally titled &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; and hosted by Don Cameron. In 1972, the series changed its name to &quot;Academic Challenge&quot; with host Don Webster, later replaced by Lou Maglio; the series later reverted to its former title during the mid-1990s, at which time Webster also returned as emcee. After a 35 consecutive year run and a brief hiatus, &quot;Academic Challenge&quot; returned to the WEWS airwaves in 2003 with host Adam Shapiro. Danita Harris hosted the 2006 season; from 2007 to 2016, Jason Nicholas was the host, succeeded by Hakem Dermish in December 2016 after Nicholas left WEWS. Dermish was succeeded by WCPN host Rick Jackson on April 28, 2018 after Dermish left WEWS for CBS Sports in New York, while Jackson was subsequently replaced by Rob Powers for the 2019 season.

==Similar shows==
A similar show predating &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; ran in the United Kingdom for many years featuring teams from British secondary schools. &quot;Top of the Form&quot; which ran on BBC Radio from 1948 to 1986 with a television version airing on BBC 1 from 1962 to 1975. 

A Canadian quiz show, &quot;Reach for the Top&quot; was modelled on &quot;Top of the Form&quot; and began on CBUT in Vancouver in 1961 with locally produced versions airing across Canada on CBC Television from 1966 to 1985. The Toronto edition of the show on CBLT was hosted for several years by Alex Trebek, who later went on to be the long-term host of &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;.

Another similar British quiz show featuring competition by post-secondary teams is &quot;University Challenge&quot;, which has been on air since 1962, making it only slightly younger than &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot;. It was featured in the British sitcom &quot;The Young Ones&quot; where one of the characters, Vyvyan, used a Stielhandgranate against another university team.

<doc id="390212" wikidata="Q559519" url="?curid=390212" title="High-Level Shader Language">
<text>The High-Level Shader Language or High-Level Shading Language (HLSL) is a proprietary shading language developed by Microsoft for the Direct3D 9 API to augment the shader assembly language, and went on to become the required shading language for the unified shader model of Direct3D 10 and higher.

HLSL is analogous to the GLSL shading language used with the OpenGL standard. It is very similar to the Nvidia Cg shading language, as it was developed alongside it. Early versions of the two languages were considered identical, only marketed differently. HLSL shaders can enable profound speed and detail increases as well as many special effects in both 2D and 3D computer graphics.

HLSL programs come in six forms: pixel shaders (fragment in GLSL), vertex shaders, geometry shaders, compute shaders, tessellation shaders (Hull and Domain shaders), and ray tracing shaders (Ray Generation Shaders, Intersection Shaders, Any Hit/Closest Hit/Miss Shaders). A vertex shader is executed for each vertex that is submitted by the application, and is primarily responsible for transforming the vertex from object space to view space, generating texture coordinates, and calculating lighting coefficients such as the vertex&#x27;s normal, tangent, and bitangent vectors. When a group of vertices (normally 3, to form a triangle) come through the vertex shader, their output position is interpolated to form pixels within its area; this process is known as rasterization.

Optionally, an application using a Direct3D 10/11/12 interface and Direct3D 10/11/12 hardware may also specify a geometry shader. This shader takes as its input some vertices of a primitive (triangle/line/point) and uses this data to generate/degenerate (or tessellate) additional primitives or to change the type of primitives, which are each then sent to the rasterizer.

D3D11.3 and D3D12 introduced Shader Model 5.1 and later 6.0.

==Shader model comparison==
GPUs listed are the hardware that first supported the given specifications. Manufacturers generally support all lower shader models through drivers. Note that games may claim to require a certain DirectX version, but don&#x27;t necessarily require a GPU conforming to the full specification of that version, as developers can use a higher DirectX API version to target lower-Direct3D-spec hardware; for instance DirectX 9 exposes features of DirectX7-level hardware that DirectX7 did not, targeting their fixed-function T&amp;L pipeline.

<text>A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. After their initial design, GPUs were found to be useful for non-graphic calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems due to their parallel structure. GPUs ability to perform vast numbers of calculations rapidly has led to their adoption in diverse fields including artificial intelligence (AI) where it excels at handling data-intensive and computationally demanding tasks. Other non-graphical uses include the training of neural networks and cryptocurrency mining. With increasing use of GPUs in non-graphical applications, mainly AI, the term GPU is also erroneously used to describe specialized electronic circuits designed purely for AI and other specialized applications.

== History ==
=== 1970s ===
Arcade system boards have used specialized graphics circuits since the 1970s. In early video game hardware, RAM for frame buffers was expensive, so video chips composited data together as the display was being scanned out on the monitor.

A specialized barrel shifter circuit helped the CPU animate the framebuffer graphics for various 1970s arcade video games from Midway and Taito, such as &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1975), &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; (1976), and &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978). The Namco Galaxian arcade system in 1979 used specialized graphics hardware that supported RGB color, multi-colored sprites, and tilemap backgrounds. The Galaxian hardware was widely used during the golden age of arcade video games, by game companies such as Namco, Centuri, Gremlin, Irem, Konami, Midway, Nichibutsu, Sega, and Taito.
The Atari 2600 in 1977 used a video shifter called the Television Interface Adaptor. Atari 8-bit computers (1979) had ANTIC, a video processor which interpreted instructions describing a &quot;display list&quot;—the way the scan lines map to specific bitmapped or character modes and where the memory is stored (so there did not need to be a contiguous frame buffer). 6502 machine code subroutines could be triggered on scan lines by setting a bit on a display list instruction. ANTIC also supported smooth vertical and horizontal scrolling independent of the CPU.

=== 1980s ===
The NEC μPD7220 was the first implementation of a personal computer graphics display processor as a single large-scale integration (LSI) integrated circuit chip. This enabled the design of low-cost, high-performance video graphics cards such as those from Number Nine Visual Technology. It became the best-known GPU until the mid-1980s. It was the first fully integrated VLSI (very large-scale integration) metal–oxide–semiconductor (NMOS) graphics display processor for PCs, supported up to 1024×1024 resolution, and laid the foundations for the emerging PC graphics market. It was used in a number of graphics cards and was licensed for clones such as the Intel 82720, the first of Intel&#x27;s graphics processing units. The Williams Electronics arcade games &quot;Robotron 2084&quot;, &quot;Joust&quot;, &quot;Sinistar&quot;, and &quot;Bubbles&quot;, all released in 1982, contain custom blitter chips for operating on 16-color bitmaps.

In 1984, Hitachi released ARTC HD63484, the first major CMOS graphics processor for personal computers. The ARTC could display up to 4K resolution when in monochrome mode. It was used in a number of graphics cards and terminals during the late 1980s. In 1985, the Amiga was released with a custom graphics chip including a blitter for bitmap manipulation, line drawing, and area fill. It also included a coprocessor with its own simple instruction set, that was capable of manipulating graphics hardware registers in sync with the video beam (e.g. for per-scanline palette switches, sprite multiplexing, and hardware windowing), or driving the blitter. In 1986, Texas Instruments released the TMS34010, the first fully programmable graphics processor. It could run general-purpose code, but it had a graphics-oriented instruction set. During 1990–1992, this chip became the basis of the Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture (&quot;TIGA&quot;) Windows accelerator cards.

In 1987, the IBM 8514 graphics system was released. It was one of the first video cards for IBM PC compatibles to implement fixed-function 2D primitives in electronic hardware. Sharp&#x27;s X68000, released in 1987, used a custom graphics chipset with a 65,536 color palette and hardware support for sprites, scrolling, and multiple playfields. It served as a development machine for Capcom&#x27;s CP System arcade board. Fujitsu&#x27;s FM Towns computer, released in 1989, had support for a 16,777,216 color palette. In 1988, the first dedicated polygonal 3D graphics boards were introduced in arcades with the Namco System 21 and Taito Air System.
IBM introduced its proprietary Video Graphics Array (VGA) display standard in 1987, with a maximum resolution of 640×480 pixels. In November 1988, NEC Home Electronics announced its creation of the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) to develop and promote a Super VGA (SVGA) computer display standard as a successor to VGA. Super VGA enabled graphics display resolutions up to 800×600 pixels, a 36% increase.

=== 1990s ===

In 1991, S3 Graphics introduced the &quot;S3 86C911&quot;, which its designers named after the Porsche 911 as an indication of the performance increase it promised. The 86C911 spawned a variety of imitators: by 1995, all major PC graphics chip makers had added 2D acceleration support to their chips. Fixed-function &quot;Windows accelerators&quot; surpassed expensive general-purpose graphics coprocessors in Windows performance, and such coprocessors faded from the PC market.

Throughout the 1990s, 2D GUI acceleration evolved. As manufacturing capabilities improved, so did the level of integration of graphics chips. Additional application programming interfaces (APIs) arrived for a variety of tasks, such as Microsoft&#x27;s WinG graphics library for Windows 3.x, and their later DirectDraw interface for hardware acceleration of 2D games in Windows 95 and later.

In the early- and mid-1990s, real-time 3D graphics became increasingly common in arcade, computer, and console games, which led to increasing public demand for hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. Early examples of mass-market 3D graphics hardware can be found in arcade system boards such as the Sega Model 1, Namco System 22, and Sega Model 2, and the fifth-generation video game consoles such as the Saturn, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64. Arcade systems such as the Sega Model 2 and SGI Onyx-based Namco Magic Edge Hornet Simulator in 1993 were capable of hardware T&amp;L (transform, clipping, and lighting) years before appearing in consumer graphics cards. Another early example is the Super FX chip, a RISC-based on-cartridge graphics chip used in some SNES games, notably &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Star Fox&quot;. Some systems used DSPs to accelerate transformations. Fujitsu, which worked on the Sega Model 2 arcade system, began working on integrating T&amp;L into a single LSI solution for use in home computers in 1995; the Fujitsu Pinolite, the first 3D geometry processor for personal computers, released in 1997. The first hardware T&amp;L GPU on home video game consoles was the Nintendo 64&#x27;s Reality Coprocessor, released in 1996. In 1997, Mitsubishi released the 3Dpro/2MP, a GPU capable of transformation and lighting, for workstations and Windows NT desktops; ATi used it for its FireGL 4000 graphics card, released in 1997.

The term &quot;GPU&quot; was coined by Sony in reference to the 32-bit Sony GPU (designed by Toshiba) in the PlayStation video game console, released in 1994.

In the PC world, notable failed attempts for low-cost 3D graphics chips included the S3 &quot;ViRGE&quot;, ATI Rage, and Matrox &quot;Mystique&quot;. These chips were essentially previous-generation 2D accelerators with 3D features bolted on. Many were pin-compatible with the earlier-generation chips for ease of implementation and minimal cost. Initially, 3D graphics were possible only with discrete boards dedicated to accelerating 3D functions (and lacking 2D graphical user interface (GUI) acceleration entirely) such as the PowerVR and the 3dfx &quot;Voodoo&quot;. However, as manufacturing technology continued to progress, video, 2D GUI acceleration, and 3D functionality were all integrated into one chip. Rendition&#x27;s &quot;Verite&quot; chipsets were among the first to do this well. In 1997, Rendition collaborated with Hercules and Fujitsu on a &quot;Thriller Conspiracy&quot; project which combined a Fujitsu FXG-1 Pinolite geometry processor with a Vérité V2200 core to create a graphics card with a full T&amp;L engine years before Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce 256; This card, designed to reduce the load placed upon the system&#x27;s CPU, never made it to market. NVIDIA RIVA 128 was one of the first consumer-facing GPU integrated 3D processing unit and 2D processing unit on a chip.

OpenGL was introduced in the early &#x27;90s by SGI as a professional graphics API, with proprietary hardware support for 3D rasterization. In 1994 Microsoft acquired Softimage, the dominant CGI movie production tool used for early CGI movie hits like Jurassic Park, Terminator 2 and Titanic. With that deal came a strategic relationship with SGI and a commercial license of SGI&#x27;s OpenGL libraries enabling Microsoft to port the API to the Windows NT OS but not to the upcoming release of Windows &#x27;95. Although it was little known at the time, SGI had contracted with Microsoft to transition from Unix to the forthcoming Windows NT OS, the deal which was signed in 1995 was not announced publicly until 1998. In the intervening period, Microsoft worked closely with SGI to port OpenGL to Windows NT. In that era OpenGL had no standard driver model for competing hardware accelerators to compete on the basis of support for higher level 3D texturing and lighting functionality. In 1994 Microsoft announced DirectX 1.0 and support for gaming in the forthcoming Windows &#x27;95 consumer OS, in &#x27;95 Microsoft announced the acquisition of UK based Rendermorphics Ltd and the Direct3D driver model for the acceleration of consumer 3D graphics. The Direct3D driver model shipped with DirectX 2.0 in 1996. It included standards and specifications for 3D chip makers to compete to support 3D texture, lighting and Z-buffering. ATI, which was later to be acquired by AMD, began development on the first Direct3D GPU&#x27;s. Nvidia, quickly pivoted from a failed deal with Sega in 1996 to aggressively embracing support for Direct3D. In this era Microsoft merged their internal Direct3D and OpenGL teams and worked closely with SGI to unify driver standards for both industrial and consumer 3D graphics hardware accelerators. Microsoft ran annual events for 3D chip makers called &quot;Meltdowns&quot; to test their 3D hardware and drivers to work both with Direct3D and OpenGL. It was during this period of strong Microsoft influence over 3D standards that 3D accelerator cards moved beyond being simple rasterizers to become more powerful general purpose processors as support for hardware accelerated texture mapping, lighting, Z-buffering and compute created the modern GPU. During this period the same Microsoft team responsible for Direct3D and OpenGL driver standardization introduced their own Microsoft 3D chip design called Talisman. Details of this era are documented extensively in the books: &quot;Game of X&quot; v.1 and v.2 by Russel Demaria, &quot;Renegades of the Empire&quot; by Mike Drummond, &quot;Opening the Xbox&quot; by Dean Takahashi and &quot;Masters of Doom&quot; by David Kushner. The Nvidia &quot;GeForce 256&quot; (also known as NV10) was the first consumer-level card with hardware-accelerated T&amp;L; While the OpenGL API provided software support for texture mapping and lighting the first 3D hardware acceleration for these features arrived with the first Direct3D accelerated consumer GPU&#x27;s.

=== 2000s ===
Nvidia was first to produce a chip capable of programmable shading: the &quot;GeForce 3&quot;. Each pixel could now be processed by a short program that could include additional image textures as inputs, and each geometric vertex could likewise be processed by a short program before it was projected onto the screen. Used in the Xbox console, this chip competed with the one in the PlayStation 2, which used a custom vector unit for hardware accelerated vertex processing (commonly referred to as VU0/VU1). The earliest incarnations of shader execution engines used in Xbox were not general purpose and could not execute arbitrary pixel code. Vertices and pixels were processed by different units which had their own resources, with pixel shaders having tighter constraints (because they execute at higher frequencies than vertices). Pixel shading engines were actually more akin to a highly customizable function block and did not really &quot;run&quot; a program. Many of these disparities between vertex and pixel shading were not addressed until the Unified Shader Model.

In October 2002, with the introduction of the ATI &quot;Radeon 9700&quot; (also known as R300), the world&#x27;s first Direct3D 9.0 accelerator, pixel and vertex shaders could implement looping and lengthy floating point math, and were quickly becoming as flexible as CPUs, yet orders of magnitude faster for image-array operations. Pixel shading is often used for bump mapping, which adds texture to make an object look shiny, dull, rough, or even round or extruded.

With the introduction of the Nvidia GeForce 8 series and new generic stream processing units, GPUs became more generalized computing devices. Parallel GPUs are making computational inroads against the CPU, and a subfield of research, dubbed GPU computing or GPGPU for &quot;general purpose computing on GPU&quot;, has found applications in fields as diverse as machine learning, oil exploration, scientific image processing, linear algebra, statistics, 3D reconstruction, and stock options pricing. GPGPU was the precursor to what is now called a compute shader (e.g. CUDA, OpenCL, DirectCompute) and actually abused the hardware to a degree by treating the data passed to algorithms as texture maps and executing algorithms by drawing a triangle or quad with an appropriate pixel shader. This entails some overheads since units like the scan converter are involved where they are not needed (nor are triangle manipulations even a concern—except to invoke the pixel shader).

Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA platform, first introduced in 2007, was the earliest widely adopted programming model for GPU computing. OpenCL is an open standard defined by the Khronos Group that allows for the development of code for both GPUs and CPUs with an emphasis on portability. OpenCL solutions are supported by Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and ARM, and according to a report in 2011 by Evans Data, OpenCL had become the second most popular HPC tool.

=== 2010s ===
In 2010, Nvidia partnered with Audi to power their cars&#x27; dashboards, using the Tegra GPU to provide increased functionality to cars&#x27; navigation and entertainment systems. Advances in GPU technology in cars helped advance self-driving technology. AMD&#x27;s Radeon HD 6000 series cards were released in 2010, and in 2011 AMD released its 6000M Series discrete GPUs for mobile devices. The Kepler line of graphics cards by Nvidia were released in 2012 and were used in the Nvidia&#x27;s 600 and 700 series cards. A feature in this GPU microarchitecture included GPU boost, a technology that adjusts the clock-speed of a video card to increase or decrease it according to its power draw. The Kepler microarchitecture was manufactured .

The PS4 and Xbox One were released in 2013; they both use GPUs based on AMD&#x27;s Radeon HD 7850 and 7790. Nvidia&#x27;s Kepler line of GPUs was followed by the Maxwell line, manufactured on the same process. Nvidia&#x27;s 28 nm chips were manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan using the 28 nm process. Compared to the 40 nm technology from the past, this manufacturing process allowed a 20 percent boost in performance while drawing less power. Virtual reality headsets have high system requirements; manufacturers recommended the GTX 970 and the R9 290X or better at the time of their release. Cards based on the Pascal microarchitecture were released in 2016. The GeForce 10 series of cards are of this generation of graphics cards. They are made using the 16 nm manufacturing process which improves upon previous microarchitectures. Nvidia released one non-consumer card under the new Volta architecture, the Titan V. Changes from the Titan XP, Pascal&#x27;s high-end card, include an increase in the number of CUDA cores, the addition of tensor cores, and HBM2. Tensor cores are designed for deep learning, while high-bandwidth memory is on-die, stacked, lower-clocked memory that offers an extremely wide memory bus. To emphasize that the Titan V is not a gaming card, Nvidia removed the &quot;GeForce GTX&quot; suffix it adds to consumer gaming cards.

In 2018, Nvidia launched the RTX 20 series GPUs that added ray-tracing cores to GPUs, improving their performance on lighting effects. Polaris 11 and Polaris 10 GPUs from AMD are fabricated by a 14 nm process. Their release resulted in a substantial increase in the performance per watt of AMD video cards. AMD also released the Vega GPU series for the high end market as a competitor to Nvidia&#x27;s high end Pascal cards, also featuring HBM2 like the Titan V.

In 2019, AMD released the successor to their Graphics Core Next (GCN) microarchitecture/instruction set. Dubbed RDNA, the first product featuring it was the Radeon RX 5000 series of video cards.

The company announced that the successor to the RDNA microarchitecture would be incremental (aka a refresh). AMD unveiled the Radeon RX 6000 series, its RDNA 2 graphics cards with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The product series, launched in late 2020, consisted of the RX 6800, RX 6800 XT, and RX 6900 XT. The RX 6700 XT, which is based on Navi 22, was launched in early 2021.

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S were released in 2020; they both use GPUs based on the RDNA 2 microarchitecture with incremental improvements and different GPU configurations in each system&#x27;s implementation.

Intel first entered the GPU market in the late 1990s, but produced lackluster 3D accelerators compared to the competition at the time. Rather than attempting to compete with the high-end manufacturers Nvidia and ATI/AMD, they began integrating Intel Graphics Technology GPUs into motherboard chipsets, beginning with the Intel 810 for the Pentium III, and later into CPUs. They began with the Intel Atom &#x27;Pineview&#x27; laptop processor in 2009, continuing in 2010 with desktop processors in the first generation of the Intel Core line and with contemporary Pentiums and Celerons. This resulted in a large nominal market share, as the majority of computers with an Intel CPU also featured this embedded graphics processor. These generally lagged behind discrete processors in performance. Intel re-entered the discrete GPU market in 2022 with its Arc series, which competed with the then-current GeForce 30 series and Radeon 6000 series cards at competitive prices.

=== 2020s ===
In the 2020s, GPUs have been increasingly used for calculations involving embarrassingly parallel problems, such as training of neural networks on enormous datasets that are needed for large language models. Specialized processing cores on some modern workstation&#x27;s GPUs are dedicated for deep learning since they have significant FLOPS performance increases, using 4×4 matrix multiplication and division, resulting in hardware performance up to 128 TFLOPS in some applications. These tensor cores are expected to appear in consumer cards, as well.

== GPU companies ==
Many companies have produced GPUs under a number of brand names. In 2009, Intel, Nvidia, and AMD/ATI were the market share leaders, with 49.4%, 27.8%, and 20.6% market share respectively. In addition, Matrox produces GPUs. Chinese companies such as Jingjia Micro have also produced GPUs for the domestic market although in terms of worldwide sales, they still lag behind market leaders.

Modern smartphones use mostly Adreno GPUs from Qualcomm, PowerVR GPUs from Imagination Technologies, and Mali GPUs from ARM.

==Computational functions==
Modern GPUs have traditionally used most of their transistors to do calculations related to 3D computer graphics. In addition to the 3D hardware, today&#x27;s GPUs include basic 2D acceleration and framebuffer capabilities (usually with a VGA compatibility mode). Newer cards such as AMD/ATI HD5000–HD7000 lack dedicated 2D acceleration; it is emulated by 3D hardware. GPUs were initially used to accelerate the memory-intensive work of texture mapping and rendering polygons. Later, were added to accelerate geometric calculations such as the rotation and translation of vertices into different coordinate systems. Recent developments in GPUs include support for programmable shaders which can manipulate vertices and textures with many of the same operations that are supported by CPUs, oversampling and interpolation techniques to reduce aliasing, and very high-precision color spaces.

Several factors of GPU construction affect the performance of the card for real-time rendering, such as the size of the connector pathways in the semiconductor device fabrication, the clock signal frequency, and the number and size of various on-chip memory caches. Performance is also affected by the number of streaming multiprocessors (SM) for NVidia GPUs, or compute units (CU) for AMD GPUs, or Xe cores for Intel discrete GPUs, which describe the number of on-silicon processor core units within the GPU chip that perform the core calculations, typically working in parallel with other SM/CUs on the GPU. GPU performance is typically measured in floating point operations per second (FLOPS); GPUs in the 2010s and 2020s typically deliver performance measured in teraflops (TFLOPS). This is an estimated performance measure, as other factors can affect the actual display rate.

===GPU accelerated video decoding and encoding===

Most GPUs made since 1995 support the YUV color space and hardware overlays, important for digital video playback, and many GPUs made since 2000 also support MPEG primitives such as motion compensation and iDCT. This hardware-accelerated video decoding, in which portions of the video decoding process and video post-processing are offloaded to the GPU hardware, is commonly referred to as &quot;GPU accelerated video decoding&quot;, &quot;GPU assisted video decoding&quot;, &quot;GPU hardware accelerated video decoding&quot;, or &quot;GPU hardware assisted video decoding&quot;.

Recent graphics cards decode high-definition video on the card, offloading the central processing unit. The most common APIs for GPU accelerated video decoding are DxVA for Microsoft Windows operating systems and VDPAU, VAAPI, XvMC, and XvBA for Linux-based and UNIX-like operating systems. All except XvMC are capable of decoding videos encoded with MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 ASP (MPEG-4 Part 2), MPEG-4 AVC (H.264 / DivX 6), VC-1, WMV3/WMV9, Xvid / OpenDivX (DivX 4), and DivX 5 codecs, while XvMC is only capable of decoding MPEG-1 and MPEG-2.

There are several dedicated hardware video decoding and encoding solutions.

====Video decoding processes that can be accelerated====
Video decoding processes that can be accelerated by modern GPU hardware are:
* Motion compensation (mocomp)
* Inverse discrete cosine transform (iDCT)
** Inverse telecine 3:2 and 2:2 pull-down correction
* Inverse modified discrete cosine transform (iMDCT)
* In-loop deblocking filter
* Intra-frame prediction
* Inverse quantization (IQ)
* Variable-length decoding (VLD), more commonly known as slice-level acceleration
* Spatial-temporal deinterlacing and automatic interlace/progressive source detection
* Bitstream processing (Context-adaptive variable-length coding/Context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding) and perfect pixel positioning

These operations also have applications in video editing, encoding, and transcoding.

===2D graphics APIs===
An earlier GPU may support one or more 2D graphics API for 2D acceleration, such as GDI and DirectDraw.

=== 3D graphics APIs ===
A GPU can support one or more 3D graphics API, such as DirectX, Metal, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulkan.

==GPU forms==

===Terminology===
In the 1970s, the term &quot;GPU&quot; originally stood for &quot;graphics processor unit&quot; and described a programmable processing unit working independently from the CPU that was responsible for graphics manipulation and output. In 1994, Sony used the term (now standing for &quot;graphics processing unit&quot;) in reference to the PlayStation console&#x27;s Toshiba-designed Sony GPU. The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as &quot;the world&#x27;s first GPU&quot;. It was presented as a &quot;single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines&quot;. Rival ATI Technologies coined the term &quot;visual processing unit&quot; or VPU with the release of the Radeon 9700 in 2002. The AMD Alveo MA35D features dual VPU’s, each using the 5 nm process in 2023.

In personal computers, there are two main forms of GPUs. Each has many synonyms:
* &quot;Dedicated graphics&quot; also called &quot;discrete graphics&quot;.
* &quot;Integrated graphics&quot; also called &quot;shared graphics solutions&quot;, &quot;integrated graphics processors&quot; (IGP), or &quot;unified memory architecture&quot; (UMA).

===Dedicated graphics processing unit===
&quot;Dedicated graphics processing units&quot; uses RAM that is dedicated to the GPU rather than relying on the computer’s main system memory. This RAM is usually specially selected for the expected serial workload of the graphics card (see GDDR). Sometimes systems with dedicated &quot;discrete&quot; GPUs were called &quot;DIS&quot; systems as opposed to &quot;UMA&quot; systems (see next section).

Dedicated GPUs are not necessarily removable, nor does it necessarily interface with the motherboard in a standard fashion. The term &quot;dedicated&quot; refers to the fact that graphics cards have RAM that is dedicated to the card&#x27;s use, not to the fact that &quot;most&quot; dedicated GPUs are removable. Dedicated GPUs for portable computers are most commonly interfaced through a non-standard and often proprietary slot due to size and weight constraints. Such ports may still be considered PCIe or AGP in terms of their logical host interface, even if they are not physically interchangeable with their counterparts.

Graphics cards with dedicated GPUs typically interface with the motherboard by means of an expansion slot such as PCI Express (PCIe) or Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP). They can usually be replaced or upgraded with relative ease, assuming the motherboard is capable of supporting the upgrade. A few graphics cards still use Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) slots, but their bandwidth is so limited that they are generally used only when a PCIe or AGP slot is not available.

Technologies such as Scan-Line Interleave by 3dfx, SLI and NVLink by Nvidia and CrossFire by AMD allow multiple GPUs to draw images simultaneously for a single screen, increasing the processing power available for graphics. These technologies, however, are increasingly uncommon; most games do not fully use multiple GPUs, as most users cannot afford them. Multiple GPUs are still used on supercomputers (like in Summit), on workstations to accelerate video (processing multiple videos at once) and 3D rendering, for VFX, GPGPU workloads and for simulations, and in AI to expedite training, as is the case with Nvidia&#x27;s lineup of DGX workstations and servers, Tesla GPUs, and Intel&#x27;s Ponte Vecchio GPUs.

===Integrated graphics processing unit===

&quot;Integrated graphics processing units&quot; (IGPU), &quot;integrated graphics&quot;, &quot;shared graphics solutions&quot;, &quot;integrated graphics processors&quot; (IGP), or &quot;unified memory architectures&quot; (UMA) use a portion of a computer&#x27;s system RAM rather than dedicated graphics memory. IGPs can be integrated onto a motherboard as part of its northbridge chipset, or on the same die (integrated circuit) with the CPU (like AMD APU or Intel HD Graphics). On certain motherboards, AMD&#x27;s IGPs can use dedicated sideport memory: a separate fixed block of high performance memory that is dedicated for use by the GPU. computers with integrated graphics account for about 90% of all PC shipments. They are less costly to implement than dedicated graphics processing, but tend to be less capable. Historically, integrated processing was considered unfit for 3D games or graphically intensive programs but could run less intensive programs such as Adobe Flash. Examples of such IGPs would be offerings from SiS and VIA circa 2004. However, modern integrated graphics processors such as AMD Accelerated Processing Unit and Intel Graphics Technology (HD, UHD, Iris, Iris Pro, Iris Plus, and Xe-LP) can handle 2D graphics or low-stress 3D graphics.

Since GPU computations are memory-intensive, integrated processing may compete with the CPU for relatively slow system RAM, as it has minimal or no dedicated video memory. IGPs use system memory with bandwidth up to a current maximum of 128 GB/s, whereas a discrete graphics card may have a bandwidth of more than 1000 GB/s between its VRAM and GPU core. This memory bus bandwidth can limit the performance of the GPU, though multi-channel memory can mitigate this deficiency. Older integrated graphics chipsets lacked hardware transform and lighting, but newer ones include it.

On systems with &quot;Unified Memory Architecture&quot; (UMA), including modern AMD processors with integrated graphics, modern Intel processors with integrated graphics, Apple processors, the PS5 and Xbox Series (among others), the CPU cores and the GPU block share the same pool of RAM and memory address space. This allows the system to dynamically allocate memory between the CPU cores and the GPU block based on memory needs (without needing a large static split of the RAM) and thanks to zero copy transfers, removes the need for either copying data over a bus (computing) between physically separate RAM pools or copying between separate address spaces on a single physical pool of RAM, allowing more efficient transfer of data.

===Hybrid graphics processing===
Hybrid GPUs compete with integrated graphics in the low-end desktop and notebook markets. The most common implementations of this are ATI&#x27;s HyperMemory and Nvidia&#x27;s TurboCache.

Hybrid graphics cards are somewhat more expensive than integrated graphics, but much less expensive than dedicated graphics cards. They share memory with the system and have a small dedicated memory cache, to make up for the high latency of the system RAM. Technologies within PCI Express make this possible. While these solutions are sometimes advertised as having as much as 768 MB of RAM, this refers to how much can be shared with the system memory.

===Stream processing and general purpose GPUs (GPGPU)===
It is common to use a general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) as a modified form of stream processor (or a vector processor), running compute kernels. This turns the massive computational power of a modern graphics accelerator&#x27;s shader pipeline into general-purpose computing power. In certain applications requiring massive vector operations, this can yield several orders of magnitude higher performance than a conventional CPU. The two largest discrete (see &quot;Dedicated graphics processing unit&quot; above) GPU designers, AMD and Nvidia, are pursuing this approach with an array of applications. Both Nvidia and AMD teamed with Stanford University to create a GPU-based client for the Folding@home distributed computing project for protein folding calculations. In certain circumstances, the GPU calculates forty times faster than the CPUs traditionally used by such applications.

GPGPUs can be used for many types of embarrassingly parallel tasks including ray tracing. They are generally suited to high-throughput computations that exhibit data-parallelism to exploit the wide vector width SIMD architecture of the GPU.

GPU-based high performance computers play a significant role in large-scale modelling. Three of the ten most powerful supercomputers in the world take advantage of GPU acceleration.

GPUs support API extensions to the C programming language such as OpenCL and OpenMP. Furthermore, each GPU vendor introduced its own API which only works with their cards: AMD APP SDK from AMD, and CUDA from Nvidia. These allow functions called compute kernels to run on the GPU&#x27;s stream processors. This makes it possible for C programs to take advantage of a GPU&#x27;s ability to operate on large buffers in parallel, while still using the CPU when appropriate. CUDA was the first API to allow CPU-based applications to directly access the resources of a GPU for more general purpose computing without the limitations of using a graphics API.

Since 2005 there has been interest in using the performance offered by GPUs for evolutionary computation in general, and for accelerating the fitness evaluation in genetic programming in particular. Most approaches compile linear or tree programs on the host PC and transfer the executable to the GPU to be run. Typically a performance advantage is only obtained by running the single active program simultaneously on many example problems in parallel, using the GPU&#x27;s SIMD architecture. However, substantial acceleration can also be obtained by not compiling the programs, and instead transferring them to the GPU, to be interpreted there. Acceleration can then be obtained by either interpreting multiple programs simultaneously, simultaneously running multiple example problems, or combinations of both. A modern GPU can simultaneously interpret hundreds of thousands of very small programs.

===External GPU (eGPU)===
An external GPU is a graphics processor located outside of the housing of the computer, similar to a large external hard drive. External graphics processors are sometimes used with laptop computers. Laptops might have a substantial amount of RAM and a sufficiently powerful central processing unit (CPU), but often lack a powerful graphics processor, and instead have a less powerful but more energy-efficient on-board graphics chip. On-board graphics chips are often not powerful enough for playing video games, or for other graphically intensive tasks, such as editing video or 3D animation/rendering.

Therefore, it is desirable to attach a GPU to some external bus of a notebook. PCI Express is the only bus used for this purpose. The port may be, for example, an ExpressCard or mPCIe port (PCIe ×1, up to 5 or 2.5 Gbit/s respectively), a Thunderbolt 1, 2, or 3 port (PCIe ×4, up to 10, 20, or 40 Gbit/s respectively), a USB4 port with Thunderbolt compatibility, or an OCuLink port. Those ports are only available on certain notebook systems. eGPU enclosures include their own power supply (PSU), because powerful GPUs can consume hundreds of watts.

==Sales==
In 2013, 438.3 million GPUs were shipped globally and the forecast for 2014 was 414.2 million. However, by the third quarter of 2022, shipments of integrated GPUs totaled around 75.5 million units, down 19% year-over-year.

<text>The Aaronic priesthood (; also called the priesthood of Aaron or the Levitical priesthood) is the lesser of the two orders of priesthood recognized in the Latter Day Saint movement. The higher being the Melchizedek priesthood. Unlike the Melchizedek priesthood, which is modeled after the authority of Jesus and the Twelve Apostles, the Aaronic priesthood is modeled after the priesthood of Aaron the Levite, the first high priest of the Hebrews, and his descendants. The Aaronic priesthood is thought to be a lesser or preparatory priesthood and an &quot;appendage&quot; of the more powerful Melchizedek priesthood.

In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) today, the holders of the Aaronic priesthood are primarily young men ages 11 to 18 and recent adult male converts to the church. The general leadership of the Aaronic priesthood, called the Presiding Bishopric, are administrative and financial agents of the church. Local leaders of the Aaronic priesthood are adult male bishops, who serve as pastoral leaders of individual congregations. Aaronic priesthood holders generally prepare, bless, and administer the sacrament, collect fast offerings, perform church and community service, assist in ministering, and occasionally perform baptisms. In their priesthood activities, holders of the Aaronic priesthood are also supported by the church&#x27;s Young Men organization.

==History==
Latter Day Saints believe that John the Baptist conferred the Aaronic priesthood directly upon Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery on May 15, 1829. Smith relates the conferral of the Aaronic priesthood in Joseph Smith–History as follows:

[W]e ... went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates [Book of Mormon] ... While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon us, he ordained us, saying:

Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.

He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter, and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterward, he should baptize me.

Accordingly, we went and were baptized.

The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second.

Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized, we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.&quot;

===Early days===
From the start of the Church of Christ, the first members of the Aaronic priesthood were mostly adults. Early priests included Joseph Smith Sr. (59), Martin Harris (47), and two 30-year-old members: Hyrum Smith and Newel Knight. Teachers were Hezekiah Peck (49), Christian Whitmer (32), Hiram Page (30), and William Smith (20). Among the early deacons in the church were Titus Billings (38).
There were some youth that were ordained to the Aaronic priesthood, including William F. Cahoon (17), Don Carlos Smith (14), and Erastus (15) and James Snow (17). In these early years, the holders of the priesthood had adult duties thrust upon them. For instance, in the Missouri Stake, the teachers quorum dealt with helping a brother quit tobacco, worked with a married couple in a dispute, settled neighborly disputes over cattle, and dealt with &quot;lying and extortion.&quot; Adult deacons assisted priests and teachers in maintaining the houses of worship, seating people, making wine for the sacrament, and getting a license so that they could preach in homes. In 1833, plans for the Kirtland Temple included four rows for the presidencies of the Aaronic priesthood; these clearly were intended for adults and not youth. In Nauvoo between 1839 and 1846, the average age of the priests was 29; however, there were four teenagers between 17 and 19. (This practice with respect to age continued on in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.)

===1849–77 in the LDS Church===
After the succession crisis which followed Smith&#x27;s death, between the years 1846 and 1877, changes started to occur as the members of the LDS Church moved west to Salt Lake City. Wards were created as the primary organizational unit of the church; however, the deacons, teachers, and priests were still stake-level positions. Adult men were still the major source for priests and teachers, as their duties entailed visiting ward members to check on spiritual well-being, settling disputes, collecting contributions, and helping those in need. Teachers occasionally would sit and judge in cases of wrongdoing, a job normally reserved for bishops. The church leadership would hold drives to ensure that positions were filled not as a need of the members to hold the priesthood, but as a need of the church to have the necessary males to accomplish the needed tasks.

By 1855, the Endowment House in Salt Lake City was completed and church leaders called for it to be busy in granting endowments to men and women. Each ward had quotas to fill in completing endowments, and the men that were sent to receive theirs were required to hold the Melchizedek priesthood. The average age of men who received the endowment at this time was 22; some were as young as 14. So many men were receiving the senior priesthood and their endowments that there were too few to fill the ranks of the junior priesthood. Brigham Young commented that perhaps men should receive the portion of the endowment pertaining to the Aaronic priesthood first before their missions. This would have allowed Aaronic priesthood holders to have served as missionaries; however, this idea was never implemented.

Melchizedek priesthood quorums also engaged in recruiting members from the Aaronic priesthood, which further depleted the ranks of the lesser priesthood. Unlike today, it was not a requirement to hold the Aaronic priesthood before receiving the Melchizedek priesthood, so the recruiting by the higher priesthood included the unordained as well. Presiding Bishop Edward Hunter and Brigham Young both lamented over the rush to ordain men to be high priests or seventies and the subsequent difficulty in keeping the Aaronic priesthood ranks filled. As examples, in 1857, Francis M. Lyman and Rudger Clawson were both ordained as elders at age 16; Clarence Merrill was ordained as a seventy at age 16.

In 1849, Young initiated an apprenticeship program whereby the holders of the Aaronic priesthood would take boys with them to teach them and give them experience. No age limits were specified. This helped to temporarily alleviate the problem arising from the dearth of Aaronic priesthood holders. By 1852, church leaders were instructing bishops to set apart members of the Melchizedek priesthood as &quot;acting&quot; teachers, priests, and deacons. Some bishops would ordain a few mature youth as teachers to accompany the &quot;acting&quot; teachers and learn the tasks. Whitney&#x27;s successor, Edward Hunter, continued this practice of ordaining seventies and high priests as &quot;acting&quot; teachers, deacons, and priests. During the 19th century, home visits, which remained the paramount task of the Aaronic priesthood, entailed visiting from between eight and 20 families monthly, quarterly, or whenever possible. They also continued to be peacemakers and occasionally would judge wrongdoers. Hunter is quoted as saying, &quot;The order of the church is to call in the labors of the teachers &amp; if they cannot reconcile the parties it cannot be done.&quot;

Youth began to be ordained to the Aaronic priesthood and in 1854 one ward reported that &quot;the principal portion of the young men had been ordained to the lesser priesthood.&quot; Possibly the youngest holders of the lesser priesthood were George J. Hunt, who was ordained a priest at age nine, and Solomon W. Harris, baptized and then ordained as a deacon at age eight. However, by the mid-1850s leaders were warning against ordaining unmarried men, and in the October 1856 general conference Young expressed disapproval regarding inexperienced &quot;young men&quot; being ordained:
When you have got your Bishop, he needs assistants, and he ordains Counsellors, Priests, Teachers, and Deacons, and calls them to help him; and he wishes men of his own heart and hand to do this. Says he, &quot;I dare not even call a man to be a Deacon, to assist me in my calling, unless he has a family.&quot; It is not the business of an ignorant young man, of no experience in family matters, to inquire into the circumstances of families, and know the wants of every person. Some may want medicine and nourishment and be looked after, and it is not the business of boys to do this, but select a man who has got a family to be a Deacon.

The 1870s saw a reversal of the trend of less youth being ordained. Circumstances at the time dictated a change. First, the youth of the Salt Lake City, Provo, and St. George areas were misbehaving in ever-increasing numbers with ever-worsening acts. Some complaints from the era were as follows: &quot;rowdyism is rampant&quot;; &quot;crowds of uncouth boys loitering around the stores halloing in the streets, and breaking horses on the Sabbath&quot;; &quot;uncouth and ill manners in refusing half the road on meeting teams&quot;; &quot;using pencils on walls and nails on the rails of the bannisters&quot;; &quot;strip[ping] of his clothes&quot; (in reference to a mentally handicapped boy); &quot;intoxicated and using the vilest language&quot;; &quot;a gang&quot; spitting &quot;tobacco juice on the floor&quot;. The church felt that it could help with such behavior, first by creating the auxiliary organizations for young women in 1869, young men in 1875, and Primary in 1878 for the younger children. This also led to a modest effort to recruit the young men into the Aaronic priesthood. Salt Lake Stake President Angus M. Cannon directed bishops &quot;to draw the young men into positions in the Priesthood and thus an excellent experience, and, at the same time, preserve them from evil associations.&quot;

However, the lack of adult men willing to serve in Aaronic priesthood was ultimately the determining factor in the church ordaining youth. Young instructed Hunter in 1873 that each stake should have a full quorum of priests, teachers, and deacons; however, Hunter complained that he could not find willing men to fill these positions. One bishop noted, &quot;It is a difficult task to find a sufficient quantity of efficient teachers. I have thought of calling upon some of the boys.&quot; Another stated, &quot;It is very hard to get the older men to act as Teachers, but the young men come forward and are willing to take their parts and therefore we have to appoint young men where older ones should be.&quot; By the time of Young&#x27;s death, he had taken the position that all boys needed some priesthood experience and that they should receive the Aaronic priesthood before reaching adulthood.

==Role within the LDS Church today==
In the LDS Church today, the Aaronic priesthood has taken on a role as a source of training, leadership, and service for adolescent boys and new converts. It is often called a &quot;preparatory priesthood.&quot; Holders of the Aaronic priesthood whom the church considers worthy are ordained to an office in the Melchizedek priesthood as a matter of course around the age of 18. Recently baptized men ages 18 and older are ordained elders after they have:

*Received the Aaronic Priesthood and served as priests.
*Developed sufficient understanding of the gospel.
*Demonstrated their worthiness.
*No specific time as a church member is required. 

The Aaronic priesthood is open only to men and boys, twelve years old or older, who are considered worthy after a personal interview with their bishop. Requirements for worthiness include abstaining from all extra-marital sexual practices, following the Word of Wisdom, payment of tithes, and attending church services.

With the exception of bishop, the offices of the Aaronic priesthood are organized primarily by age, and an adolescent boy will be ordained to the next office if found worthy upon reaching the appropriate age. Active Aaronic priesthood holders seldom delay ordination to another priesthood office. The conferral and ordination to an office in the Aaronic priesthood is performed by the laying on of hands by a priest or by those holding the Melchizedek priesthood.

With the exception of bishop, Aaronic priesthood holders of the same office are organized into a quorum, each being led by a president and counselors. The president of the priests quorum is the bishop or branch president. Each ward has one or more quorums of each office of the priesthood if there are young men of the appropriate age group.

The church-wide titular head of the Aaronic priesthood is the Presiding Bishop. However, because the Aaronic priesthood is composed primarily of the youth of the church, the presidency of the Young Men organization supervises much of the church-wide organization involving the Aaronic priesthood.

=== Hierarchy ===
Holders of the Aaronic priesthood meet at the ward or branch where the priesthood holder lives. Young men who do not hold the office of the priesthood of the age group associated with each quorum are still invited and encouraged to attend with the quorum of their age group. However, priesthood duties can only be performed by those who are ordained.
==== Bishop ====
==== Priest ====
==== Teacher ====
In the LDS Church, the teacher is the second of four offices in the Aaronic priesthood. Male members of the church are eligible to be ordained teachers at the beginning of the year in which they turn 14 years of age. Approval by the bishop and an interview with him or one of his counselors is required before ordination. Prior to ordination, the proposed ordination must also be accepted by common consent by the members of the ward. With the approval of the bishop, a priest or a holder of the Melchizedek priesthood may ordain a person to the office of teacher by the laying on of hands.

As specified in the Doctrine and Covenants, a teachers quorum may not contain more than 24 members. As a result, in some larger wards there are two teacher quorums. A presidency, consisting of a president, first counselor, and second counselor, is called from members of the quorum by the bishopric and set apart to serve as the presidency of the teachers quorum. The president of the teachers quorum is given priesthood keys by the laying on of hands by the bishop to preside over the members of his quorum. A secretary to the presidency may also be called from the quorum membership. The members of the teachers quorum presidency and the secretary may not be set apart until after they have been accepted by the common consent of the members of the quorum.

The duties of a teacher are to assist the priests in taking care of the temporal needs of the church, and &quot;to warn, expound, exhort, and teach, and invite all to come unto Christ&quot;. Teachers are permitted to assist in preparing the sacrament, usher during sacrament meeting, and perform all the duties of a deacon. Teachers are also typically paired with an adult male (often their father) to perform ministering.

An adult teachers quorum adviser may be called to assist the teachers. Sometimes an assistant adviser is also called.

After an interview with the bishop, teachers who are deemed worthy are ordained to the office of priest at the beginning of the year in which they turn 16 years of age, whereupon they will become members of the priests quorum. 

==== Deacon ====

In the LDS Church, the deacon is the first of four offices of the Aaronic priesthood to which a male may be ordained. Male members of the church may become deacons at the beginning of the year in which they turn 12 years of age. A bishop may give approval for such members to receive the Aaronic priesthood and ordained to the office of deacon. Prior to ordination, the candidate must have an interview with the bishop or one of his counselors, and the proposed ordination must be accepted by common consent by the members of the ward. With the bishop&#x27;s approval, a person who holds the office of priest or a holder of the Melchizedek priesthood is able to perform the ordination of a deacon by the laying on of hands.

Deacons in a ward are organized in quorums. The Doctrine and Covenants states that a president of a deacons quorum can preside over 12 deacons. As a result, in some large wards, there may be two or more quorums of deacons. From the members of each deacon&#x27;s quorum, a president, first counselor, second counselor, and secretary may be called and set apart by the bishopric. The president and his two counselors constitute the deacon&#x27;s quorum presidency. The president of the deacons quorum is given priesthood keys by the laying on of hands by the bishop to preside over the members of his quorum. The members of the deacons quorum presidency and the secretary may not be set apart until after they have been accepted by the common consent of the members of the quorum.

The duties of a deacon are to assist the teachers in taking care of the temporal needs of the church, and &quot;to warn, expound, exhort, and teach, and invite all to come unto Christ&quot;. In modern practice, one of the deacons&#x27; primary duties is to pass the sacrament to the members of the congregation during sacrament meeting. Deacons also may receive fast offerings from the members of their ward on fast Sunday. A deacon may often sit beside the bishopric during sacrament meeting to act as a messenger or assistant to the bishop.

An adult advisor may be called to assist the deacon&#x27;s quorum. Sometimes an assistant advisor is called.

<doc id="390227" wikidata="Q225095" url="?curid=390227" title="Rinkai Line">
<text>The is a railway line in Tokyo, Japan. It is the only line operated by the third-sector company Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit. It connects central Tokyo to the artificial islands of Aomi and Odaiba. The line is served by some trains on the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) Saikyō Line which continue on to , , , and .

==Overview==
While not part of the Tokyo subway network (as it was built to JR specifications), the Rinkai Line is fully grade separated and runs underground for nearly of its distance, going as low as below the ground when crossing under the Port of Tokyo. The Shinonome – Shin-Kiba segment (which uses the former Keiyō Freight Line) is elevated.

== Station list ==
All stations are located in Tokyo. All trains stop at every station on the line.


==Rolling stock==
* TWR 70-000 series 10-car EMUs (since 1996)
* JR East E233-7000 series 10-car EMUs (since 30 June 2013)

The TWR 70-000 series electric multiple unit (EMU) trains are based at Yashio Depot, which is accessed via a spur located between Tennōzu Isle Station and Tokyo Teleport Station (the spur track also provides access to Tokyo Freight Terminal), while the E233 series trains are based at Kawagoe Depot.

The first of a fleet of 31 new 10-car E233-7000 series sets were introduced on Saikyō Line, Kawagoe Line, and Rinkai Line services between and from 30 June 2013, displacing the fleet of 205 series EMUs.

A new train type will be introduced in 2024, replacing the 70-000 series. The new type was revealed to be designated as 71-000 series on 6 November 2023. The revised entry into service is scheduled to take place in the middle of 2025 rather than 2024.

===Former rolling stock===
* JR East 205 series 10-car EMUs (2002–2016)

==History==
Construction of the line started in 1992, with the eastern end of the line using the right-of-way of the Keiyō Freight Line (abandoned in 1983). The first portion of the line between and opened for service on March 30, 1996, initially under the name . The name was officially changed to the Rinkai Line on September 1, 2000. The extension to opened on March 31, 2001, and the final portion to Osaki on December 1, 2002.

The project ran severely over budget, with an estimated final cost of over ¥440 billion. In 2005, the Rinkai Line&#x27;s average ridership was 140,000 passengers per day and, in 2006, the line finally registered its first operational profit, although interest payments on ¥389 billion yen in debt have resulted in a consistent net loss since 1991. By comparison, the competing elevated Yurikamome line is profitable, thanks to lower construction expenses, higher ticket prices and popularity among tourists and leisure visitors for its scenic views.

However, the Rinkai Line&#x27;s ridership has steadily increased since, reaching 200,200 passengers per day in 2010. The ridership is forecast to increase further due to future development planned for the area served by the line.

Station numbering was introduced to all Rinkai Line stations in 2016 with stations being assigned station numbers R01 (Shin-Kiba) and R08 (Osaki).

==Operating company==

 was founded on March 12, 1991, for the express purpose of constructing and operating the railway line. It is a third-sector company, and, as of 1 April 2013, 91.32% of shares are held by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 2.41% by JR East, 1.77% by Shinagawa Ward, 0.70% by Mizuho Bank, 0.46% by MUFG Bank, 0.34% by Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, and the remaining 3% by 41 other companies.

In spite of its severe financial situation, TWR was discovered to have made a five million yen donation to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government on October 16, 2009, to encourage the city&#x27;s bid for the 2016 Olympic Games. The company stood to benefit financially if the games were held in Tokyo, as several of the proposed venues were located along the Rinkai Line.

In addition to its ownership and operation of the Rinkai Line, TWR is also involved in real estate and subcontracting/management of station- and building-related design.

==Future plans==

In August 2014, it was revealed that JR East was in negotiations to buy out the Rinkai Line. This would make it easier to incorporate the line into its plans for a direct line to Haneda Airport as well as providing through services to and from the JR Keiyo Line.

<text>Michel Amato, better known by his stage name The Hacker, is a French electroclash and techno producer who has worked extensively with Miss Kittin. His work has been influenced by electronic artists like Kraftwerk, new wave artists such as the Cure and Depeche Mode, as well as the French rave scene of the early 1990s. His artist name comes from the Jeff Mills track of the same name.

==Career==
The Hacker started making music in 1989 at the age of 17 in Grenoble, France. At the time, Duran Duran was an early influence, but he later discovered the darker side of electro through electronic body music groups like Cabaret Voltaire and D.A.F. In 1993, The Hacker took on the hardcore side of electro and released a few 12”s with Benoit Bollini under the name XMF.

In 1995, he made his own music in classic Detroit styled after Jeff Mills. His first tracks were released on the Ozone and Interface labels. Three years later, The Hacker founded his own label, Goodlife Records (named from a classic track from Inner City), with his friends Oxia and Alex Reynaud. However, he also released tracks on other labels such as &quot;A Strange Day&quot; on UMF and &quot;Method of Force&quot; on Sativae. His debut album &quot;Mélodies En Sous-Sol&quot; (spring 2000) echoes New Order and Dopplereffekt.

In the mid-1990s, The Hacker began producing electro-pop with his friend, Caroline Hervé (aka Miss Kittin). DJ Hell loved their first track &quot;Gratin Dauphinois&quot; and signed them to his new label International DJ Gigolo in 1997. In Germany, their success was immediate owing to the releases of the EPs &quot;Champagne&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Intimités&quot; in 1999. The &quot;Champagne&quot; EP included the tracks &quot;1982&quot; and &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot;, which immediately became anthems of the electroclash scene. After the release of their &quot;First Album&quot; in 2001 they became popular worldwide. The Hacker is also sought-after as a producer, and has done remixes for Marc Almond, Fischerspooner, Air, and Nitzer Ebb.

In 2002, after their U.S. tour, The Hacker and Miss Kittin decided to take a break from their collaborative projects. The Hacker took this opportunity to produce many new tracks released on vinyl, such as &quot;The Beach&quot; on Mental Groove and &quot;Dance Industria&quot; on Tiga&#x27;s label Turbo. He collaborated with Kiko, Alexander Robotnick, millimetric and David Carretta, touring all over the globe as a DJ and started work on his next album.

The Hacker released his second album, &quot;Rêves Mécaniques&quot; in 2004. It became his first album to chart on the French Albums Chart, peaking at #130 and spending a total of four weeks on the chart.

In 2007, he rejoined with Miss Kittin to release the double A-side &quot;Hometown&quot;/&quot;Dimanche&quot;. To celebrate his tenth anniversary as a recording artist, The Hacker released the CD/DVD set &quot;X&quot; in 2008. The compilation contains live recordings, singles and some new studio tracks.

Miss Kittin &amp; The Hacker reunited as a duo in 2008, after a short tour of European clubs at the end of 2007, and the &quot;Hometown EP&quot; was released in June that year. Further touring followed throughout America and around the world in 2008, before they both started recording new songs, some of which were performed whilst touring. In March 2009, they released their second album &quot;Two&quot;, 8 years after their first and only full LP as a duo. The first single &quot;1000 Dreams&quot; was also released in March, alongside a new club single &quot;PPPO - People Pleasure Power Objects&quot;, both taken from the new album. The reformed duo embarked on a new European tour all summer in 2008, kicking off in France in early April.

<doc id="390237" wikidata="Q1075561" url="?curid=390237" title="Automatic rifle">
<text>An automatic rifle is a type of autoloading rifle that is capable of fully automatic fire. Automatic rifles are generally select-fire weapons capable of firing in semi-automatic and automatic firing modes (some automatic rifles are capable of burst-fire as well). Automatic rifles are distinguished from semi-automatic rifles in their ability to fire more than one shot in succession once the trigger is pulled. Most automatic rifles are further subcategorized as battle rifles or assault rifles.

==History==

===Maxim===
In June 1883 Hiram Maxim filed his first patent to do with automatic firearms covering semi-automatic and fully automatic Winchester and Martini-Henry rifles as well as an original automatic rifle and blowback- and recoil-operated machine guns, both single and multi-barrelled.

===Mannlicher===

In 1885 Ferdinand Mannlicher made an experimental self-loader based on work begun in 1883 in both semi-automatic and fully automatic modes. It was an impractical failure due to fouling by its black powder ammunition, but it influenced later designs. Furthermore, Mannlicher produced smokeless powder automatic rifles from the early 1890s onwards until his death in 1904.

===Cei-Rigotti===

One of the world&#x27;s first automatic rifles was the Italian Cei-Rigotti. This rifle started out as an 1891 gas-operated conversion of the Vetterli rifle, which received positive approval and was even adopted after further refinements in 1895 for the Royal Italian Navy, but although up to 2000 rifles were ordered, the order never came through for as yet unknown reasons. Another version of the Cei-Rigotti was presented in 1900, these 6.5mm Carcano or 7.65×53mm gas-operated, selective-fire carbines attracted considerable attention at the time. They used 10-, 20- and 50-round box magazines. The Cei-Rigotti had several failings, including frequent jams and erratic shooting. In the end, no Army took an interest in the design and the rifle was abandoned before it could be further developed. Although the rifle was never officially adopted by any military, aside from the 1895 variant which never came through, it was tested extensively by the Italian Army during the lead-up to the First World War.

=== Chauchat ===
The Chauchat, designed in 1907, was one of the first automatic rifles to be adopted by a military. Its official design was the Fusil Mitrailleur Modele 1915 CSRG. It was placed into French Infantry in 1916, and was used by the French army in the First World War. The Chauchat in 8mm Lebel was also extensively used in 1917–18 by the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.), where it was officially designated as the &quot;Automatic Rifle, Model 1915 (Chauchat)&quot;.

=== Lewis Gun ===

The Lewis Gun was invented in 1911 by Isaac Newton Lewis and first mass-produced in Belgium in 1913 for the .303 British cartridge, and widely used by the British army in the First World War, both by infantry and fitted to aircraft. Pan magazines are secured above the breech, holding either 47 or 97 rounds. Cooling fins surround the barrel. The weapon is gas operated and fires automatically at 500-600 rounds per minute.

More than 50,000 Lewis guns were produced during WW1, becoming the most common automatic weapon used by British and American troops. Although superseded by the Bren gun by 1939, nearly 60,000 Lewis guns were refurbished and reissued to British forces after the Dunkirk evacuation of 1940.

=== Fedorov Avtomat ===

The Fedorov Avtomat (also anglicized as Federov, Russian: Автомат Фёдорова) or FA was a select-fire, crew-served automatic rifle and was one of the first practical automatic rifles, designed by Vladimir Grigoryevich Fyodorov in 1915 and produced in the Russian Empire and later in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. A total of 3,200 Fedorov rifles were manufactured between 1915 and 1924 in the city of Kovrov; the vast majority of them were made after 1920. The weapon saw limited combat in World War I, but was used more substantially in the Russian Civil War and in the Winter War. In 1916, the Weapons Committee of the Russian Army made a decision to order no less than 25,000 Fedorov automatic rifles. In the summer of 1916, a company from the 189th Izmail Regiment was equipped with 8 Fedorov Avtomats. Trained in tactics with the new weapon, they concluded that the Fedorov worked best as a crew served weapon. The gunner armed with the Fedorov and an ammo bearer armed with an Arisaka rifle. As both weapons used the same ammo and same 5 round stripper clips, this allowed for the greatest flexibility. It also allowed for the ammo bearer to fire defensively, while the gunner reloaded. It was also recommended that the primary mode of fire be in semi-automatic, as the Fedorov&#x27;s would rapidly overheat in full-auto. Some consider it to be an &quot;early predecessor&quot; or &quot;ancestor&quot; to the modern assault rifle, while others believe that the Fedorov Avtomat was the world&#x27;s first assault rifle.

===Browning Automatic Rifle===

The Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR) was one of the first practical automatic rifles. The BAR made its successful combat debut in World War I, and approximately 50,000 were made before the war came to an end. The BAR arose from the concept of &quot;walking fire&quot;, an idea urged upon the Americans by the French who used the Chauchat light machine gun to fulfill that role. The BAR never entirely lived up to the designer&#x27;s hopes; being neither a rifle nor a machinegun. &quot;For its day, though, it was a brilliant design produced in record time by John Browning, and it was bought and used by many countries around the world. It was the standard squad light automatic of the U.S. infantry during World War II and saw use in every theater of war.&quot; The BAR was praised for its reliability and stopping power. &quot;The US forces abandoned the BAR in the middle 1950s, though it was retained in reserve stocks for several years; it survived in smaller countries until the late 1970s.&quot;

=== AVS-36 ===

The AVS-36 (from &quot;Avtomaticheskaya Vintovka Simonova 1936 model&quot;; (АВС-36)) was a Soviet automatic rifle which saw service in the early years of World War II. It was among the early selective fire infantry rifles (capable of both single and full-automatic fire) formally adopted for military service. The designer, Sergei Simonov, began his work with a gas-operated self-loading rifle in 1930. The first prototype was ready in 1931 and appeared promising, and three years later a trial batch of an improved design was made. In 1935, a competition between Simonov&#x27;s design and a rifle made by Fedor Tokarev was held. The Simonov rifle emerged as a winner and was accepted into service as the AVS-36. The AVS-36 was first seen in public in the 1938 May Day parade in Moscow, when it was displayed by the marching 1st Rifle Division. The American public became aware when it was covered in an August 1942 issue of the American &quot;Infantry Journal&quot;, in an article by John Garrett Underhill Jr. Simonov would later design an anti-tank rifle, the PTRS-41, and the SKS carbine, which employed simpler tilting bolt operation.

===FG 42===

The FG 42 is a selective fire automatic rifle or battle rifle produced in Germany during World War II. The weapon was developed specifically for the use of the Fallschirmjäger airborne infantry in 1942 and was used in limited numbers until the end of the war. It served as a squad automatic rifle in much the same role as the Browning BAR. It combined the firepower of a light machine gun in a lightweight package no larger than the standard-issue Kar 98k bolt-action rifle. It was considered one of the most advanced weapon designs of World War II. The FG 42 influenced post-war small arms development and most of its design was copied by the US Army when they developed the M60 machine gun.

===Sturmgewehr 44===

The Germans were the first to pioneer the assault rifle concept, during World War II, based upon research that showed that most firefights happen within 400 meters and that contemporary rifles were over-powered for most small arms combat. The Germans sought to develop a select-fire intermediate powered rifle combining the firepower of a submachine gun with the accuracy and range of a rifle. This was done by shortening the standard 7.92×57mm cartridge to 7.92×33mm and giving it a lighter 125-grain bullet, that limited range but allowed for more controllable automatic fire. The result was the Sturmgewehr 44.

===AK-47===
Like the Germans, the Soviets were influenced by experience showing most combat happens within 400 meters and that their soldiers were consistently outgunned by heavily armed German troops, especially those armed with the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifles. The Soviets were so impressed with the Sturmgewehr 44, that after World War II, they held a design competition to develop an assault rifle of their own. The winner was the AK-47. It was finalized, adopted and entered widespread service in the Soviet army in the early 1950s. Its firepower, ease of use, low production costs, and reliability was perfectly suited for the Red Army&#x27;s new mobile warfare doctrines. The AK-47 was widely supplied or sold to nations allied with the USSR and the blueprints were shared with several friendly nations (the People&#x27;s Republic of China standing out among these with the Type 56). The AK-47 and AKM type rifles are the most produced firearms in history.

===M14 rifle (battle rifle)===
The U.S. Army was influenced by combat experience with semi-automatic weapons such as the M1 Garand and M1 carbine, which enjoyed a significant advantage over enemies armed primarily with bolt-action rifles. Although U.S. Army studies of World War II combat accounts had very similar results to that of the Germans and Soviets, the U.S. Army maintained its traditional views and preference for high-powered semi-automatic rifles.

After World War II, the United States military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the M1 Garand, M1/M2 Carbines, M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, M3 &quot;Grease Gun&quot; and Thompson submachine gun. However, early experiments with select-fire versions of the M1 Garand proved disappointing. During the Korean War, the select-fire M2 Carbine largely replaced submachine guns in US service. However, combat experience suggested that the .30 Carbine round was underpowered. American weapons designers reached the same conclusion as the Germans and Soviets: an intermediate round was necessary, and recommended a small caliber, high velocity-cartridge.

However, senior American commanders, having faced fanatical enemies and experienced major logistical problems during World War II and the Korean War, insisted that a single powerful .30 caliber cartridge be developed, that could not only be used by the new automatic rifle, but by the new general purpose machine gun (GPMG) in concurrent development. This culminated in the development of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge and the M14 rifle which was basically an improved select-fire M1 Garand with a 20-round magazine. The U.S. also adopted the M60 GPMG. Its NATO partners adopted the FN FAL and HK G3 rifles, as well as the FN MAG and Rheinmetall MG3 GPMGs.

===FN FAL===
The FN FAL is a 7.62×51mm NATO, selective fire, automatic rifle produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). During the Cold War, it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, most notably with the British Commonwealth as the L1A1. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries. The FAL was predominantly chambered for the 7.62mm NATO round, and because of its prevalence and widespread use among the armed forces of many western nations during the Cold War it was nicknamed &quot;The right arm of the Free World&quot;.

===H&amp;K G3===

The H&amp;K G3 is a 7.62×51mm NATO, selective fire, automatic rifle produced by the German armament manufacturer Heckler &amp; Koch GmbH (H&amp;K) in collaboration with the Spanish state-owned design and development agency CETME (&quot;Centro de Estudios Técnicos de Materiales Especiales&quot;). The rifle proved successful in the export market, being adopted by the armed forces of over 60 countries. After World War II, German technicians involved in developing the Sturmgewehr 45, continued their research in France at CEAM. The StG45 mechanism was modified by Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor Löffler at the Mulhouse facility between 1946 and 1949. Vorgrimler later went to work at CETME in Spain and developed the line of CETME automatic rifles based on his improved Stg45 design. Germany eventually purchased the license for the CETME design and manufactured the Heckler &amp; Koch G3 as well as an entire line of weapons built on the same system, one of the most famous being the MP5 SMG.

===M16 rifle===
The first confrontations between the AK-47 and the M14 (assault rifle vs battle rifle) came in the early part of the Vietnam War. Battlefield reports indicated that the M14 was uncontrollable in automatic mode and that soldiers could not carry enough ammo to maintain fire superiority over the AK-47. A replacement was needed: A medium between the traditional preference for high-powered rifles such as the M14, and the lightweight firepower of the M2 Carbine.

As a result, the Army was forced to reconsider a 1957 request by General Willard G. Wyman, commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command (CONARC) to develop a .223 caliber (5.56 mm) select-fire rifle weighing 6 lbs (2.7 kg) when loaded with a 20-round magazine. The 5.56mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. helmet at 500 yards (460 meters) and retain a velocity in excess of the speed of sound while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the .30 Carbine cartridge.

This request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaled-down version of the ArmaLite AR-10, called ArmaLite AR-15 rifle. However, despite overwhelming evidence that the AR-15 could bring more firepower to bear than the M14, the Army opposed the adoption of the new rifle. In January 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the AR-15 was the superior weapon system and ordered a halt to M14 production. At the time, the AR-15 was the only rifle available that could fulfill the requirement of a universal infantry weapon for issue to all services. After modifications (Most notably: the charging handle was re-located from under the carrying handle like AR-10 to the rear of the receiver), the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M16.

The M16 entered U.S. service in the mid-1960s and was much lighter than the M14 it replaced, allowing soldiers to carry more ammunition. Despite its early failures, the M16 proved to be a revolutionary design and stands as the longest continuously serving rifle in American military history. It is a benchmark against which other assault rifles are judged, and used by 15 NATO countries, and more
than 80 countries worldwide

===HK33===

During the 1960s, other countries would follow the Americans lead and begin to develop 5.56×45mm assault rifles, most notably Germany with the Heckler &amp; Koch HK33. The HK33 was essentially a smaller 5.56mm version of the 7.62×51mm Heckler &amp; Koch G3 rifle. As one of the first 5.56mm assault rifles on the market, it would go on to become one of the most widely distributed assault rifles. The HK33 featured a modular design with a wide range of accessories (telescoping butt-stocks, optics, bipods, etc.) that could be easily removed and arranged in a various configurations.

===5.56mm NATO===

The adoption of the M16, the H&amp;K33, and the 5.56×45mm cartridge inspired an international trend towards relatively small-sized, lightweight, high-velocity military service cartridges that allow a soldier to carry more ammunition for the same weight compared to the larger and heavier 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. The 5.56mm cartridge is also much easier to shoot. In 1961 marksmanship testing, the U.S. Army found that 43% of ArmaLite AR-15 shooters achieved Expert, while only 22% of M-14 rifle shooters did so. Also, a lower recoil impulse allows for more controllable automatic weapons fire.

Therefore, in March 1970, the U.S. recommended that all NATO forces adopt the 5.56×45mm cartridge. This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military&#x27;s long-held position about caliber size. By the middle of the 1970s, other armies were looking at assault rifle type weapons. A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977. The U.S. offered the 5.56×45mm M193 round, but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of body armor. In the end, the Belgian 5.56×45mm SS109 round was chosen (STANAG 4172) in October 1980. The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger, heavier, 62 grain bullet design, with better long range performance and improved penetration (specifically, to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters).

During the 1970s, the USSR developed the AK-74 and the 5.45×39mm cartridge, which has similar physical characteristics to the U.S. 5.56×45mm cartridge. Also during the 1970s, Finland, Israel, South Africa and Sweden introduced AK type rifles in 5.56×45mm. During the 1990s, the Russians developed the AK-101 in 5.56×45mm NATO for the world export market. In addition, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and former countries of Yugoslavia have also rechambered their locally produced assault rifle variants to 5.56mm NATO. The adoption the 5.56mm NATO and 5.45×39mm cemented the worldwide trend toward small caliber, high-velocity cartridges.

===Steyr AUG (bullpup rifle)===

In 1977, Austria introduced the 5.56×45mm Steyr AUG bullpup rifle, often cited as the first successful bullpup rifle, finding service with the armed forces of over twenty countries. It was highly advanced for the 1970s, combining in the same weapon the bullpup configuration, a polymer housing, dual vertical grips, an optical sight as standard, and a modular design. Highly reliable, light, and accurate, the Steyr AUG showed clearly the potential of the bullpup layout. In 1978, France introduced the 5.56×45mm FAMAS bullpup rifle. In 1985, the British introduced the 5.56×45mm L85 bullpup rifle. In the late 1990s, Israel introduced the Tavor TAR-21 and China&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army&#x27;s adopted QBZ-95. By the turn of the century, the bullpup design had achieved world-wide acceptance.

<text>is a private railway operator in Tokyo, Japan and the central firm of the that is involved in transport, retail, real estate and other industries. The Keio railway network connects western suburbs of Tokyo (Chōfu, Fuchū, Hachiōji, Hino, Inagi, Tama) and Sagamihara in Kanagawa with central Tokyo at Shinjuku Station.

The name is derived from taking one character each from the places through which the railway runs: and .

==Network overview==

==Lines==

The Keio network is based around the central Keiō Line, , 32 stations.

The Keio Inokashira Line does not share track with the Keio Main Line. It intersects with the Keio Line at Meidaimae Station.

==History==
The company&#x27;s earliest predecessor was the founded in 1905. In 1906 the company was reorganized as the , and in 1910 was renamed yet again to . It began operating its first stretch of interurban between Sasazuka and Chōfu in 1913. By 1923, Keiō had completed its main railway line (now the Keiō Line) between Shinjuku and Hachiōji. Track along the Fuchū – Hachiōji section was originally laid in 1,067 mm gauge by the ; it was later changed to match the rest of the line&#x27;s 1,372 mm gauge.

The Inokashira Line began operating in 1933 as a completely separate company, . This company had also planned to link with Suzaki (now Kōtō ward), though this never materialized. In 1940, Teito merged with the Odakyu Electric Railway, and in 1942 the combined companies were merged by government order into (now Tokyu Corporation).

In 1947, the shareholders of Tokyu voted to spin off the Keio and Inokashira lines into a new company, . The Teito name was dropped in 1998 in favor of , though &quot;KTR&quot; placards and insignia can still be seen occasionally. The company&#x27;s English name was changed to Keio Corporation on June 29, 2005.

=== Priority seats ===

Keiō was among the first railway companies to introduce priority seats on its trains. Priority seats are those reserved for the physically handicapped, elderly, pregnant women, and people with infants. These special seats, which were initially called &quot;Silver seats&quot; but renamed in 1993, were inaugurated on Respect for the Aged Day on September 15, 1973.

==Rolling stock==
All Keio trains have longitudinal (commuter-style) seating.

=== gauge lines===
* 7000 series (since 1984)
* 8000 series (since 1992)
* 9000 series (since 2001)
* 5000 series (2nd generation) (since 2017)

The first of a fleet of five new ten-car 5000 series EMUs was introduced on 29 September 2017, ahead of the start of new evening reserved-seat commuter services from Shinjuku in spring 2018.

<text>The Blaine Act, formally titled Joint Resolution Proposing the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution, is a joint resolution adopted by the United States Congress on February 20, 1933, initiating repeal of the 18th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which established Prohibition in the United States. Repeal was finalized when the 21st Amendment to the Constitution was ratified by the required minimum number of states on December 5, 1933.

==Initial activity in the 72nd Congress==
The Volstead Act implemented the 18th Amendment (Prohibition). The act defined &quot;intoxicating beverage&quot; as one with 0.5 percent alcohol by weight. Numerous problems with enforcement and a desire to create jobs and raise tax revenue by legalizing beer, wine, and liquor led a majority of voters and members of Congress to turn against Prohibition by late 1932.

===Political situation===

When the first legislative session of the 72nd United States Congress opened on December 7, 1931, more than two dozen bills were offered amending the Volstead Act or repealing the 18th Amendment altogether. Republicans, who controlled both houses in the previous Congress, had previously been united in their support for Prohibition and, with the support of &quot;dry&quot; (pro-Prohibition) Democrats, easily garnered more than the two-thirds majority needed to block any vote on even the slightest easing of the Volstead Act. Now, however, 64 &quot;wet&quot; Republicans formed a caucus in the House of Representatives to work with Democrats (who had a slim majority after winning a number of special elections) to seek modification or repeal. The Democrats also changed the rules of the House, adopting a discharge petition procedure which would force a bill to the floor for a vote if 145 members requested it.

Legislative activity initially focused on the Senate. Among the bills filed at the start of the session was one by Senator Hiram Bingham III (R-Conn.), which amended the Volstead Act to permit the manufacture of beer which was 4 percent alcohol by weight. His bill would not have modified the 18th Amendment. Republican &quot;wets&quot; were able to win a minor victory on December 23, 1931, when they secured an agreement establishing a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee which would hold hearings regarding modification of the Volstead Act and repeal of the 18th Amendment. Senator John J. Blaine (R-Wisc.), a leader of the Senate&#x27;s Republican &quot;wets&quot;, was named subcommittee chair. Although the five-member subcommittee had a three-member &quot;dry&quot; majority, &quot;wets&quot; only wanted to use the subcommittee to lay the groundwork for a vote (at some indeterminate future) on a Prohibition bill (of some undetermined type). &quot;Wets&quot; won another victory a few days later when the Senate Committee on Manufactures agreed to hold hearings on Bingham&#x27;s 4 percent beer bill.

These small victories emboldened &quot;wet&quot; forces. On December 26, Senator Bingham submitted legislation to repeal the 18th Amendment. Three-fourths of the state legislatures were required to approve any amendment, and Bingham believed that too many legislatures still supported Prohibition. Bingham&#x27;s bill therefore proposed submitting the amendment to the public via a national referendum or ratification by conventions specially elected by voters in each state. In the House, where &quot;wet&quot; forces were in somewhat disarray, Majority Leader Henry T. Rainey (D-Ill.) (a &quot;dry&quot; himself) tried to block legislation by telling &quot;wets&quot; that they would have a single opportunity for a vote. It didn&#x27;t matter if the bill was modification or repeal, he said. In response, a bipartisan caucus of &quot;wets&quot; decided to submit a plan to modify the 18th Amendment according to the recommendations issued in 1931 by the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement (the Wickersham Commission), a panel established by President Herbert Hoover to study law enforcement problems under Prohibition.

In the first direct vote on the issue since Prohibition began, the Senate rejected the Bingham repeal resolution, 55 to 15, on January 21, 1932. &quot;Drys&quot; hailed the vote as symbolic of the weakness of the repeal forces.

===Wavering support for changing Prohibition===

&quot;Wets&quot; in Congress perceived that support for Prohibition was waning. A week after the defeat of the Bingham repeal proposal, House &quot;wets&quot; began drafting legislation to amend the Volstead Act to permit the manufacture of beer once more. Their goal was to force a vote before the session of Congress ended in July 1932. With only 34 &quot;wet&quot; votes in the Senate and 190 in the House, repeal lobbyists believed no action could be taken until after the November 1932 elections.

Congressional &quot;wets&quot; received a major boost on February 20 when a leading Democratic candidate for president, Franklin D. Roosevelt, announced he supported repeal of the 18th Amendment as a means of generating tax revenues for the federal government and states. Roosevelt&#x27;s support for repeal boosted &quot;wet&quot; support in the House. On February 16, the House Judiciary Committee had voted 14-to-9 against the Beck-Linthicum resolution, which would have asked state legislatures to reaffirm or repeal the 18th Amendment. House &quot;wets&quot; then shocked political leaders in both sides on February 25 by obtaining 110 signatures on a discharge petition for the Beck-Linthicum resolution. The &quot;wets&quot; secured the required 145 signatures for discharge on March 1. The Beck-Linthicum resolution received 187 votes, resulting in the smallest majority &quot;drys&quot; had managed to muster since the start of Prohibition. House &quot;wets&quot;, who considered the vote on Beck-Linthicum only a test of their growing strength, were thrilled by the vote.

The House test vote was encouraging to Senate &quot;wets&quot; as well. On March 19, Blaine&#x27;s Judiciary subcommittee favorably reported a bill by Senator Bingham proposing the legalization of 4 percent beer. Surprisingly, the subcommittee report even called modification of the 18th Amendment useless. Three days later, a bipartisan group of 38 senators surprised the Senate by signing a letter demanding a vote to modify or repeal the 18th Amendment. The letter referred to four resolutions before Blaine&#x27;s subcommittee. Senator George W. Norris (R-Neb.), chair of the full Judiciary Committee, promised the group that his committee would report at least one of the bills (favorably or not), and give senators a chance to vote on it on the Senate floor.

House &quot;wets&quot; appeared to suffer a setback on March 25 when the House rejected a bill, proposed by Rep. Thomas H. Cullen (D-N.Y.), to amend the Volstead Act to permit the manufacture of 2.75 percent beer and tax it.

&quot;Wets&quot; in the Senate also lost ground. Blaine began holding hearings on repeal of the 18th Amendment in mid April, and on April 19 the Senate Manufactures Committee unfavorably reported a 4 percent beer bill which had the perverse outcome of enabling a floor vote. In this test vote, &quot;wets&quot; were able to secure only 24 votes.

In May 1932, House &quot;wets&quot; shocked the political establishment again by securing enough signatures on a discharge petition to free the O&#x27;Connor-Hull bill from the House Ways and Means Committee. The House defeated the bill, which would have permitted 2.75 percent beer and taxed it at a rate of 3 percent of its retail value, 228 to 169. It was a significant drop in anti-Prohibition support.

===Election of 1932 and effect on Prohibition repeal===

The political situation among voters in the various states was strongly in favor of Prohibition repeal, however. Although a majority of delegates to the 1932 Republican National Convention, held in Chicago June 14 to 16, were in favor of repealing the 18th Amendment, President Hoover was not. A compromise was reached in which the convention adopted a party platform plank which advocated amending Prohibition to permit states to follow the law in whole or in part (subject to federal control). The plank also rejected a national referendum in favor of approval/disapproval by state legislatures. The platform plan was widely criticized for not taking a stand on Prohibition. &quot;Dry&quot; organizations, however, backed Hoover strongly, seeing in him their only chance of preserving Prohibition in any form.

At the 1932 Democratic National Convention, held in Chicago from June 27 to July 2, an overwhelming majority supported a repeal of the 18th Amendment. The party&#x27;s platform contained a plank proposing repeal by conventions specially elected by voters in each state (the Bingham proposal from earlier in the year). The plank also proposed allowing states and their localities to stay &quot;dry&quot; if they so chose. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the party&#x27;s nominee for President of the United States, campaigned strongly in favor of repeal.

&quot;Wets&quot; of both parties in Congress were elated by the Democratic Party platform, and agreed, at a minimum, to seek significant amendment of the Volstead Act before the end of the 72nd Congress in March 1933. Senate &quot;wets&quot; were particularly encouraged after Senator Cameron A. Morrison (D-N.C.), a radical &quot;dry&quot;, was defeated for reelection in the June 1932 Democratic primary and Senator Carter Glass (D-Va.), another strong &quot;dry&quot;, abruptly began advocating repeal. However, when Senator Bingham attempted to move his repeal resolution forward, Senate leaders blocked the move. In the House, &quot;wets&quot; rushed to circulate discharge petitions on four bills which would make beer legal again.

By late fall, it was clear to many leaders in Congress that the &quot;wet&quot; movement already had majority support. Polls of candidates for Congress showed that at least 80 percent of them supported repeal of the 18th Amendment. Rep. John W. Summers (R-Wash.), &quot;dry&quot; chair of the House Judiciary Committee, now believed it was inevitable that the 18th Amendment would be resubmitted to the states. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner believed Congress would approve the sale of beer by the end of the session. Prominent &quot;wets&quot; in the Senate were less hopeful, as their forces were divided between supporting modification of the Volstead Act and outright repeal of the 18th Amendment.

On Election Day, more than 100 &quot;dry&quot; candidates lost their seats in Congress. In the House, a super-majority of new and reelected members supported outright repeal, while in the Senate the repeal super-majority was just three votes short. Two more repeal votes were gained when Senator Thomas J. Walsh (D-Mont.), a leading &quot;dry&quot;, agreed to vote for modification or repeal on November 12, followed by Senator Arthur Vandenberg (R-Mich.) on November 18.

==Passage of the Blaine Act==

As the lame-duck session of Congress opened in November, House Majority Leader Rainey—bowing to the wishes of his caucus—announced that House leaders would move with all due speed on Prohibition changes. A survey of House members showed a strong majority for amending the Volstead Act to make beer legal again, with fewer in favor of a repeal of the 18th Amendment. Despite President Hoover&#x27;s pledge to veto the legislation, Speaker Garner said he would clear all legislative calendars to give a &quot;beer bill&quot; priority before Congress was forced to adjourn.

On December 6, Senator Blaine introduced Senate Joint Resolution 211, whose text amended and rewrote the 18th Amendment to read that Congress shall not have &quot;the power to authorize the transportation or importation into any State or Territory of the United States for use therein of intoxicating liquors for beverage or other purposes within the State or Territory if the laws in force therein prohibit such transportation or importation&quot;. Alcohol imported into a prohibited area was subject to local (not federal) law, and Congress was authorized to enact legislation to aid states in enforcing their own liquor laws.

===Repeal failure in the House===
The first attempt at repeal of the 18th Amendment came in the House. Speaker Garner (a &quot;wet&quot;) surprised &quot;wet&quot; forces by announcing on November 23 that he himself had drafted a resolution (H.J.Res. 480) calling for repeal of the amendment and was prepared to suspend the rules of the House in order to get it passed. The Garner plan received a setback on December 2 when the House Judiciary Committee voted 13 to 6 to reject the resolution. Observers disputed whether the Garner resolution was flawed, or whether &quot;drys&quot; had decided to oppose it at last.

The House went into session again on December 5, and the Garner resolution went to the floor for a vote. Although Democratic Party whips had counted 275 votes in favor of repeal, the resolution failed to win the necessary two-thirds majority. The final vote was 272 to 144, with 79 former &quot;drys&quot; (66 Democrats and 13 Republicans) voting in favor of repeal. Angry and dejected, Garner proclaimed the issue &quot;dead&quot; for the remainder of the lame-duck session and said Congress would have to wait until the new &quot;wet&quot; majority took power in the 73rd Congress on March 4, 1933.

Rep. James M. Beck (R-Pa.), co-sponsor of the Beck-Linthicum bill (which had gone down to defeat nine months earlier), believed the House would have adopted Garner&#x27;s resolution if he had not tried to force the issue on the first day of the lame-duck session.

===The &quot;beer bills&quot;===
The House leadership resigned itself to action on the &quot;Collier bill&quot;, legislation sponsored by Rep. James Collier (D-Miss.) which would legalize 2.75 percent beer and wine and levy a $5 per barrel tax ($ in dollars) on beer and a 20 percent retail sales tax on wine. On December 15, the Ways and Means Committee voted 17 to 7 in favor of this bill (which was amended to legalize 3.2 percent beer). The bill was amended to prohibit legal sales of wine, but attempts to include a ban on bars and saloons were beaten back. Although proposed amendments threatened to split &quot;wet&quot; ranks, the House passed the Collier bill on December 21 by a surprising large margin of 230 to 165. An amendment to the bill restricted shipments of beer into states which chose to retain Prohibition.

In the Senate, both &quot;beer bills&quot; and 18th Amendment repeal resolutions were pursued. Senator Tydings proposed legislation authorizing the sale of beer with any percentage of alcohol, and taxing beer at 16 percent of its retail value. Senator Bingham, however, sought passage of a measure identical to the original Collier bill. &quot;Wets&quot; in the Senate also sought to bring a repeal resolution to the floor as swiftly as possible. The Senate voted down, 48 to 23, an attempt on December 23 to bring the Bingham bill to the floor for debate and a vote. Senators pointed out that the bill did not actually amend the Volstead Act, but was stand-alone legislation. They feared that the Bingham-Collier bill would be found unconstitutional unless the Volstead Act itself were amended. Senator Blaine promised an immediate redraft to meet these concerns.

===Moving the Blaine bill in the Senate===

On January 5, 1933, the Blaine subcommittee substantially amended S.J.Res. 211 during markup. Section one of the proposed constitutional amendment now explicitly repealed the 18th amendment. New language in section two prohibited the sale of intoxicating beverages in any state or territory which prohibited them, while section three gave Congress the concurrent power to regulate or prohibit the consumption of intoxicating beverages in certain establishments. The final section provided for ratification by state legislatures, with a seven-year time limit. The new text was sharply criticized by repeal advocates, who saw the new ratification procedure as a breach of faith and who strongly objected to the concurrent federal power granted in section three.

The full Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported S.J.Res. 211 on January 9 in an 11 to 5 vote.

Blaine moved to have the Senate consider S.J.Res. 211 on February 14. &quot;Drys&quot; in the Senate engaged in an eight-hour filibuster, led by Senators Morris Sheppard (D-Tex.) and Smith W. Brookhart (R-Iowa). Finally, frustrated by the filibuster&#x27;s blockage of all Senate business (including emergency legislation to deal with the Great Depression&#x27;s banking crisis), a successful cloture vote occurred at 10 P.M. which ended the filibuster.

During debate on the Blaine bill on February 15, the Senate made two substantive changes to the resolution. Senator Joseph T. Robinson (D-Ark.) offered an amendment in the form of a substitution to provide for ratification by state convention rather than state legislatures. The amendment was agreed to by a vote of 45 to 15. Senator Robinson then offered an amendment striking section two, but then modified his own motion to strike instead section three. The amendment was agreed to by a vote of 33 to 32. The Senate resumed debate on February 16. Senator David A. Reed (R-Pa.) asked for reconsideration of the vote to strike section three, and Senator Carter Glass attempted to offer S.J.Res. 202 as an amendment in the nature of a substitute. Glass&#x27; motion was rejected by a vote of 14 to 70. Senator Tydings attempted to prevent Congress from taxing any intoxicating beverage it chose to prohibit, but his amendment was rejected in a voice vote. Glass attempted again to substitute S.J.Res. 202 (this time as an amendment), and was again rejected 38 to 46. Reed&#x27;s amendment to restore section three was also rejected, by a vote of 37 to 47. Senator Thomas Gore (D-Okla.) attempted to amend section two to bar the sale of intoxicating beverages for private profit, but his motion was rejected by voice vote.

The Senate then approved the amended resolution by a vote of 63 to 23, five more votes than the required two-thirds majority.

===Moving the Blaine bill in the House===
Adoption of S.J.Res. 211 created new repeal activity in the House. Majority Leader Rainey called an immediate meeting of the Democratic caucus, and Speaker Garner said he intended to seek suspension of the rules in order to bring repeal to a quick vote and to bar any attempt to amend the resolution on the floor.

On February 20, Majority Leader Rainey asked for suspension of the rules and immediate adoption of S.J.Res. 211. Debate was limited to just 20 minutes pro and con. The House adopted Rainey&#x27;s motion on a vote of 289 to 121. S.J.Res. 211 was passed with 15 more votes than the required two-thirds majority.

==Adoption of the 21st Amendment==

S.J.Res. 211 was sent to the United States Secretary of State on February 20, 1933.

On March 21, 1933, Congress enacted the Cullen-Harrison Act, which redefined &quot;intoxicating beverage&quot; as one with 3.2 percent alcohol by weight. The Cullen-Harrison Act went into effect on April 7, 1933.

The 21st Amendment was ratified by state ratifying conventions on December 5, 1933. A nationwide radio audience listened in as Utah became the 36th state to ratify the amendment.

<doc id="390246" wikidata="Q987382" url="?curid=390246" title="EMD AEM-7">
<text>The EMD AEM-7 is a twin-cab four-axle B-B electric locomotive built by Electro-Motive Division (EMD) and ASEA between 1978 and 1988. The locomotive is a derivative of the Swedish SJ Rc4 designed for passenger service in the United States. The primary customer was Amtrak, which bought 54 for use on the Northeast Corridor and Keystone Corridor. Two commuter operators, MARC and SEPTA, also purchased locomotives, for a total of 65.

Amtrak ordered the AEM-7 after the failure of the GE E60 locomotive. The first locomotives entered service in 1980 and were an immediate success, ending a decade of uncertainty on the Northeast Corridor. In the late 1990s, Amtrak rebuilt 29 of its locomotives from DC to AC traction. The locomotives continued operating through the arrival of the final Siemens ACS-64 in June 2016. MARC retired its fleet in April 2017 in favor of Siemens Chargers, and SEPTA retired all seven of its AEM-7s in November 2018 in favor of ACS-64s.

== Background ==
Amtrak assumed control of almost all private sector intercity passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. Amtrak retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (electric and diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s.

Operation on the electrified portion of the Northeast Corridor was split between the Budd Metroliner electric multiple units and PRR GG1 locomotives. The latter were over 35 years old and restricted to . Amtrak sought a replacement, but no US manufacturer offered an electric passenger locomotive. Importing and adapting a European locomotive would require a three-year lead time. With few other options, Amtrak turned to GE to adapt the E60C freight locomotive for passenger service. GE delivered two models, the E60CP and the E60CH. However, the locomotives proved unsuitable for speeds above , leaving Amtrak once again in need of a permanent solution.

Amtrak then examined existing European high-speed designs, and two were imported for trials in 1976–77: the Swedish SJ Rc4 (Amtrak X995, SJ No. 1166), and the French SNCF Class CC 21000 (Amtrak No. X996, SNCF No. 21003). Amtrak favored the Swedish design, which became the basis for the AEM-7.

== Design ==
The AEM-7 was far smaller than its predecessors, the PRR GG1 and the GE E60. It measured long by wide, and stood tall, a decrease in length of over . The AEM-7&#x27;s weight was half that of the E60CP or the GG1. On its introduction it was the &quot;smallest and lightest high horsepower locomotive in North America.&quot; The Budd Company manufactured the carbodies for the initial Amtrak order, while the Austrian firm Simmering-Graz-Pauker built the carbodies for the MARC and SEPTA orders.

Reflecting the varied electrification schemes on the Northeast Corridor the locomotives could operate at three different voltages: 11 kV 25 Hz AC, 12.5 kV 60 Hz AC and 25 kV 60 Hz. A pair of Faiveley DS-11 two-stage pantographs, one at each end of the locomotive, collected power from the overhead catenary wire. Thyristor converters stepped down the high-voltage AC to provide DC power at a much lower voltage to four traction motors, one per axle. As built the AEM-7 was rated at , with a starting tractive effort of and a continuous tractive effort of . Its maximum speed was . A separate static converter supplied 500 kW 480 V head-end power (HEP) for passenger comfort. This was sufficient to supply heating, lighting, and other electrical needs in 8-10 Amfleet cars.

=== AEM-7AC ===

The rebuilt AEM-7ACs used AC traction instead of DC traction. The power modules used water-cooled insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) technology and provided about of traction power plus of HEP, twice the HEP capacity of the original DC units. The 6 FXA 5856 traction motors, from Alstom&#x27;s ONIX family of propulsion components, had a maximum rating of each and a continuous rating of . The remanufactured AEM-7ACs were the world&#x27;s first passenger locomotives to incorporate IGBT technology.
== History ==
Amtrak planned a fleet of 53 locomotives, with an estimated cost of $137.5 million. Limited funding hampered that plan, but in September 1977 Amtrak proceeded with a plan to buy 30 locomotives for $77.8 million. Five groups bid on the contract: General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Division (EMD)/ASEA, Morrison–Knudsen/Alstom, Brown Boveri, Siemens/KraussMaffei, and AEG/KraussMaffei. Amtrak awarded the contract to the EMD/ASEA partnership in January 1978. It ordered 17 more locomotives in February 1980, bringing the total to 47.

The Railroad Test Track at the Transportation Test Center in Pueblo, Colorado was electrified in 1979 under sponsorship by the Northeast Corridor. The first locomotive completed, No. 900, was delivered to Amtrak in February 1980, then after acceptance testing, it was shipped to TTC for performance tests from April 1980 to May 1981. Testing included evaluation of three different pantograph designs, instantaneous power and total energy consumed during operation, and reliability testing, during which the AEM-7 was operated for .

Revenue service began on May 9, 1980, when No. 901 departed Washington Union Station with a &quot;Metroliner&quot; service. The Swedish influence led to the nickname &quot;Meatball&quot;, after Swedish meatballs. Railfans nicknamed the boxy locomotives &quot;toasters&quot;. Between 1980 and 1982, 47 AEM-7s (Nos. 900–946) went into service. Amtrak retired the last of its PRR GG1s on May 1, 1981, while most of the GE E60s were sold to other operators. The new locomotives swiftly proved themselves; &quot;Car and Locomotive Cyclopedia&quot; stated that no new locomotive since the New York Central Hudson had &quot;such an impact on speeds and schedule performance.&quot;

This strong performance led to further orders. Amtrak added seven more locomotives in 1987, delivered in 1988, for a total of 54. Two commuter operators in the Northeast ordered AEM-7s. MARC ordered four in 1986 for use on its Penn Line service on the Northeast Corridor between Washington, D.C., and Perryville, Maryland. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) ordered seven in 1987. Amtrak also used the AEM-7s to handle the &quot;Keystone Service&quot; on the Keystone Corridor between Harrisburg and Philadelphia as the Budd Metroliners, displaced from the Northeast Corridor, reached the end of their service lives.

=== Refurbishment ===
In 1999, Amtrak and Alstom began a remanufacturing program for Amtrak&#x27;s AEM-7s. Alstom supplied AC propulsion equipment, electrical cabinets, transformers, HEP, and cab displays. The rebuild provided Amtrak with locomotives that had improved high end tractive effort and performance with longer trains. Amtrak workers performed the overhauls under Alstom supervision at Amtrak&#x27;s shop in Wilmington, Delaware. These remanufactured AEM-7s were designated AEM-7AC. Between 1999 and 2002, Amtrak rebuilt 29 of its AEM-7s.

=== Retirement ===
As the locomotives passed 30 years of service their operators made plans for replacements. In 2010, Amtrak ordered 70 Siemens ACS-64 locomotives to replace both the AEM-7s and the newer but unreliable Bombardier/Alstom HHP-8s. The ACS-64s began entering revenue service in February 2014. The last two active AEM-7s, Amtrak Nos. 942 and 946, made their final run on June 18, 2016, on a special farewell excursion that ran between Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia.

While Amtrak was replacing its AEM-7s, MARC initially decided in 2013 to phase out its electric operations on the Penn Line altogether and retire both its AEM-7 and Bombardier–Alstom HHP-8 locomotives, but the railroad instead started a refurbishment program for its HHP-8s in 2017. , the first HHP-8 reconditioned under this program had been delivered and was undergoing successful testing. MARC selected the Siemens Charger diesel locomotive as the replacement for its AEM-7 fleet in 2015. The last of the MARC AEM-7s were retired by April 2017, with the Chargers entering service in January 2018.

SEPTA continues to use electric traction, replacing its seven AEM-7s and lone ABB ALP-44, an improved AEM-7, with fifteen ACS-64s. The first SEPTA ACS-64, #901, entered revenue service on July 11, 2018. On December 1, 2018, SEPTA held a farewell excursion for the AEM-7 and ALP-44 locomotives along the Paoli/Thorndale Line.

=== Post-retirement ===

Two locomotives, ex-Amtrak Nos. 928 and 942, were moved to the Transportation Technology Center in July 2017. 15 AEM-7s entered storage at the Seaview Transportation Company in Rhode Island amid potential interest from the MBTA. When the MBTA declined to acquire the units, Seaview began scrapping them, with three units remaining in late 2024.

Caltrain, which operates commuter trains in the San Francisco Bay Area, purchased two retired Amtrak AEM-7s to test their electrification system once completed. The units would also serve as backup power for EMU cars. On June 7, 2018, the board awarded two contracts totalling approximately $600,000: one to purchase two AEM-7ACs from Mitsui &amp; Co, and the other to Amtrak for refurbishment, training, and transportation to the Caltrain maintenance facility in San Jose. Locomotive Nos. 929 and 938 were delivered to California by Amtrak in June 2019.

The seven SEPTA AEM-7s were leased to NJ Transit beginning in late December 2018 for the purpose of allowing NJ Transit to roster additional locomotives equipped with positive train control (PTC) in order to meet a deadline for operating PTC-capable equipment. However, they were never used and subsequently returned. SEPTA then used them exclusively for overnight work service during autumn, cleaning tracks and applying traction gel. In 2022, SEPTA sold the AEM-7s and ALP-44 for scrap.

Three ex-Amtrak units have been preserved: Nos. 915 at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, 945 at the Illinois Railway Museum, 917 at the Danbury Railway Museum. A fourth unit, no. 927, was purchased from Seaview by Northeast Rail Heritage Inc. in 2024 for eventual preservation.

<text>The Metroliners were extra-fare high-speed trains between Washington, D.C., and New York City which operated from 1969 to 2006. They were briefly first operated by Penn Central Transportation (successor to the Pennsylvania Railroad, which originally ordered the equipment), then by Amtrak for 35 years.

Service originally ran with Budd Metroliners, self-powered electric multiple unit cars designed for high-speed service. These proved unreliable and were replaced with locomotive-hauled trains in the 1980s. The trains had reserved business-class and first-class seating. The fastest trips between New York Penn Station and Washington Union Station were scheduled for 2.5 hours, though some midday trains around 1980 had schedules as long as 4 hours.

Amtrak replaced &quot;Metroliner&quot; service with the high-speed &quot;Acela Express&quot;, which runs up to in revenue service. The first &quot;Acela Express&quot; trains ran in 2000, but due to equipment difficulties at the time they did not fully replace the &quot;Metroliners&quot; until 2006.

==History==
===Beginning of service===
The High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 started a U.S. Government effort to develop a high speed train for Northeast Corridor service. The U.S. Department of Transportation worked with the Pennsylvania Railroad, Budd Company, General Electric and Westinghouse to develop an electric multiple unit high speed passenger train. An initial order of 50 Budd Metroliner cars was placed on May 6, 1966, with a target service date of October 1967. Service was to operate at with later increases to , with hourly New York – Washington service and half-hourly New York – Philadelphia service. The Johnson Administration saw the new service as political capital and pushed for an aggressive schedule.

The new cars were primarily intended for high-level platforms for faster boarding; the PRR constructed high-level island platforms at Wilmington, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. in 1967 and 1968. On June 13, 1967, the PRR announced plans for a suburban New Jersey station directly off the Garden State Parkway. The same month, the PRR decided on the &quot;Metroliner&quot; name for the vehicles and service, and announced that the trains would have higher fares than conventional service.

The first cars were delivered in September 1967, but soon proved to have numerous electric issues. Start of service was delayed to January 1968, then postponed indefinitely in March 1968. The PRR folded into Penn Central on February 1, 1968. SEPTA refused its 11 Metroliners, intended for Philadelphia-Harrisburg service, in August; Penn Central eventually leased them, increasing its fleet to 61. In October 1968, testing proved that the cars could operate the desired sub-3-hour trip time, and substation modifications by Westinghouse increased electrical reliability. Penn Central and Budd reached a settlement on their legal fight in November; on December 20, Penn Central announced that service would begin on January 16, 1969. 

A Washington-New York round trip for VIPs was operated on January 15, 1969. &quot;Metroliner&quot; service finally started on January 16, 1969, with a single daily round trip leaving New York in the morning and Washington in the afternoon. A second round trip on a corresponding reversed schedule was added on February 10. A non-stop round trip on a 2.5 hour schedule was added on April 2, 1969. However, problems with the cars persisted; maximum speeds temporarily dropped from to soon after.

Despite difficulties, the service proved overwhelmingly popular and fairly reliable, with 90% on-time performance by May 1. Penn Central added a computerized ticketing system in August 1969, and doubled service to six daily round trips on October 27. On March 16, 1970, Capital Beltway station opened to serve the &quot;Metroliners&quot;, and all trips were scheduled for under three hours. A seventh round trip was added that August. Beginning on February 1, 1971, a cross-platform transfer to Turboliner service to Boston was offered at Penn Station. However, top speed was soon reduced again to , making the &quot;Metroliners&quot; scarcely faster than conventional trains.

===Amtrak era===
Amtrak took over intercity passenger service from private operators on May 1, 1971. Although many trains were discontinued with the takeover, &quot;Metroliner&quot; service increased to 9 round trips. Schedules further increased to 12 round trips on an hourly schedule on November 14, 1971; one trip was extended to New Haven, Connecticut (then the northern limit of electrification). Two more round trips were added on May 1, 1972, and the all-time maximum of 15 round trips was reached on October 28, 1973.

===Change of equipment===
Although initially promising, the Budd Metroliners proved unreliable; by January 1978, GG1 and E60 locomotives hauling conventional Amfleet coaches (whose design was based on the &quot;Metroliner&quot;) had better on-time percentages than &quot;Metroliners&quot;. In March 1978, Amtrak began sending the cars to General Electric for rebuilding. A GG1/Amfleet set covered one &quot;Metroliner&quot; round trip on a slower schedule.

In 1982, Amtrak finished replacing the Budd Metroliner cars, which had developed problems with their motors limiting their speed, with trains powered by the Swedish-developed AEM-7 locomotives pulling Amfleet coaches. Maximum speed of locomotive-hauled &quot;Metroliner&quot;s increased to in 1982 and in 1985. In the six months following October 29, 1990, the morning nonstop express trains were scheduled to cover the distance between Washington and New York in two hours and thirty minutes, an average speed from start to arrival of better than 90 miles per hour.

===Discontinuance===
Amtrak expanded &quot;Metroliner&quot; service when problems developed with &quot;Acela Express&quot; braking systems during 2002 and 2005. As trainsets were repaired, the number of &quot;Metroliner&quot; trains declined to one round trip each weekday, which was finally discontinued on October 27, 2006. The current &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; service matches the top speed of &quot;Metroliner&quot; service, but makes more stops and does not offer first class seating. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amtrak ran one non-stop Acela train each way on weekdays with a travel time of 2 hours and 33 (or 35 southbound) minutes, comparable to the Metroliner service. As of 2023, those trains have not been restored and the fastest travel time is now 2 hours 45 minutes with stops in Baltimore, Wilmington, Philadelphia, and Newark.

===Other &quot;Metroliner&quot; services===

Amtrak operated several other short-lived services under the &quot;Metroliner&quot; brand.

On October 31, 1982, Amtrak added two &quot;New England Metroliner&quot; round trips between New York City and Boston, which ran with diesel locomotives north of New Haven. These were discontinued on April 28, 1984.

The next day, an additional round trip was added to the Los Angeles – San Diego corridor, supplementing the &quot;San Diegan&quot;. Branded as &quot;Metroliner&quot;, it made only two intermediate stops, cutting 15 minutes from the normal &quot;San Diegan&quot; schedule. The trip was discontinued on April 28, 1985.

On October 29, 1989, Amtrak introduced a single one-way morning &quot;Metroliner&quot; trip from Downingtown, Pennsylvania, to Washington. The trip largely served Amtrak employees, as a corresponding evening trip to serve regular commuters was not offered. The Downingtown trip was discontinued on October 25, 1991.

<text>is a series of light novels written by Shoji Gatoh and illustrated by Shikidouji. The series follows Sousuke Sagara, a member of the covert anti-terrorist private military organization known as Mithril, tasked with protecting Kaname Chidori, a hot-headed Japanese high school girl born with strange abilities that attracts the attention of various antagonistic groups. 

Individual chapters are published on &quot;Monthly Dragon Magazine&quot;, followed by a paperback compilation released by Fujimi Shobo&#x27;s Fujimi Fantasia Bunko. The novels are split between stories focusing on Sousuke&#x27;s mission as a soldier of Mithril and comedic side stories centered on his life at Jindai High School.

The series has been adapted into different media; including four anime television series: &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; by Gonzo in 2002, &quot;Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid&quot; by Kyoto Animation in 2003 and 2005 respectively. An OVA was also released in 2006; and the newest television series, &quot;Full Metal Panic! Invisible Victory&quot; by Xebec, premiered in April 2018. The series also had several different manga series.

Tokyopop licensed the novels for English-language publication in North America and released parts of the series, while ADV Films licensed and dubbed the first season and the spin-off. The second season was licensed by Kadokawa Pictures USA with ADV Films producing the dub yet again. Mandalay Pictures acquired the film rights to the series in 2009. At Anime USA 2009, Funimation announced that it had acquired the rights to the first and second series of &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; and both were re-released and remastered on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010. The series began airing in North America on November 22, 2010, on the Funimation Channel. The &quot;Fumoffu&quot; series made its North American television debut on the Funimation Channel on November 15, 2010.

A spin-off to the light-novel series called &quot;Full Metal Panic! Another&quot; was serialized between 2011 and 2016. &quot;Another&quot; received a manga adaptation split in two series. The light novels have sold 11 million copies.

== Synopsis ==
=== Setting ===
The series is set in a alternate history, based upon actual world events around the late 20th century to the early 21st century. The story begins in Heisei 10 (1998 A.D.), where the Cold War has yet to end. China has split into a north and south, with Hong Kong being split much like Berlin. The major differences between real life Earth and the &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; universe are:

* China has split into the People&#x27;s Liberation Committee (North China) and the Democratic Chinese Alliance (South China) along the Yangtze River. Kowloon is a North Chinese territory, while Hong Kong Island is held by South Chinese forces. Combat in Hong Kong is prohibited by terms of a recent peace treaty.
* A nuclear warhead was used in the 1991 Gulf War. This triggered the Fifth Middle East War.
* Following the beginning of the fifth Middle East war, the Soviet Union successfully reinvaded Afghanistan, which is called &quot;Helmajistan&quot; in the anime series.
* Mikhail Gorbachev was assassinated and Perestroika was halted.
* Distinct military technology such as Arm Slaves and Black Technology were developed.

A number of other details differentiates the fictional world. Common changes occur in the Japanese names, as they use homonyms to the names of real life locations. The fictional Jindai High School is based on the real life Jindai High School in Chōfu, Tokyo. The closest station to the real life Jindai High School is the Sengawa Station, changed from Sengawa to Izumikawa. The Japanese calendar of Heisei is altered from Heisei to Hiramasa.

=== Plot ===

The series follows Sousuke Sagara, a member of a covert anti-terrorist private military organization known as Mithril, tasked with protecting Kaname Chidori, a spirited Japanese high school girl. He moves to Japan to study at Chidori&#x27;s school, Jindai High School, with assistance from his comrades Kurz Weber and Melissa Mao. Having never experienced social interactions, Sousuke is seen as a military maniac by his schoolmates as he interprets everyday situations from a combat perspective. He comes to relate with Chidori who realizes that Sousuke is protecting her, but he does not reveal the reasons due to orders as well as the fact that he does not know why Chidori is being targeted by different organizations.

== Development ==
When starting the series, Shoji Gatoh commented that as the series&#x27; theme was &quot;Boy Meets Girl&quot;. Gatoh worked in the order to keep that as the focus regardless of the several other conflicts the story presented. Gatoh and Shiki Douji had a close relationship in the making of the novels. Gatoh gave Douji freedom in the design of the characters such as Sagara and Leonardo who were given multiple traits. On the other hand, Gatoh also gave Douji references for &quot;gentlemen&quot; featured in the story.

In the making of the series Gatoh did not find difficulties in creating a balance between sci-fi and realistic elements since multiple Japanese series like &quot;Tetsujin 28&quot; and &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; already provide the demographic a mixture between those elements. Originally, Douji felt that the characters were too realistic. Believing the teenage demographic would not like them, the author changed them so that were seen as cooler characters. While the duo did not have difficulties with the novels&#x27; serious storylines, they still had problems with comedy.

Chidori and Sousuke&#x27;s relationship was based on Japanese comedy due to how the two interact. To create a more interesting dynamic between the two leads, Gatoh wanted to change the ways Sagara and Chidori interact as he was tired of female characters requiring to be protected in the making for the light novels. As a result, Chidori instead supports Sagara multiple times.

== Media ==

=== Light novels ===

The light novel series &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; is written by Shoji Gatoh and illustrated by Shikidouji. It was serialised by Fujimi Shobo in its monthly magazine &quot;Gekkan Dragon Magazine&quot; since June 1998 and published under the Fujimi Fantasia Bunko imprint in tankōbon format since September 1998. Gatoh often found delays in writing of the novels, which led to delays to the publication of the series&#x27; volumes. The series focuses on Sergeant Sousuke Sagara&#x27;s arrival to the Jindai High School where he was assigned to protect the student Kaname Chidori while also acting as a student.

A total of twelve full length volumes have been released from September 18, 1998, to August 20, 2010. In parallel to the twelve volumes, nine standalone light novels of the series (which form the short story collection) have also been published from December 17, 1998, to August 20, 2011. Finally two more volumes titled &quot;Side Arms&quot; focusing on the past of some characters (which form the side story collection) and the birth of Mithril and Amalgam have been published on April 20, 2004, and July 20, 2006. In contrast to the full length volumes, short story collection focuses on the comedy elements from the series. In January 2010, Gatoh wrote another of these stories in celebration of &quot;Gekkan Dragon Magazine&quot;″s 300th issue, which has been included in the last short story collection volume. Another series of spin-off novels, &quot;Full Metal Panic! Another&quot;, has been released by Naoto Ōguro with supervision of Shoji Gatoh, and also illustrated by Shikidouji, from August 20, 2011, to February 20, 2016, consisting of thirteen volumes and set years after the original series&#x27; ending. The light novels have also been adapted into various manga, as well as three anime television series and an OVA episode for which Gatoh was also part of the staff.

Tokyopop licensed the &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; series for North America release, publishing the first regular light novel on September 11, 2007. The latest released volume is the fourth on February 1, 2011, which is a compilation from the original fourth and fifth full-length volumes from the series. No short story collection volumes nor side story collection ones have been published and the company has shut down its publishing operations in North America on May 31, 2011. In 2015, at Anime Expo and San Diego Comic-Con, Tokyopop announced that it would be relaunching its publishing operations in North America in 2016 and that they will consider light novels, but nothing has been disclosed about &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; novels publication.

On March 18, 2019, J-Novel Club announced that all the original 12 novels will be translated again and released in English. The series was released as e-books starting that year, with the final volume released in 2021. Hardcover &quot;Collectors Editions,&quot; each compiling three novels per volume, were released by J-Novel Club from 2020 to 2022. On July 1, 2022, J-Novel announced that they were translating the short stories. They were released as e-books starting that year, with the final volume released in 2023. On October 3, 2023, Podium Audio released an audiobook version of the first volume.

On May 19, 2023, Kadokawa announced that a new &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; series will be published, centering on Sousuke and Kaname two decades after the events of &quot;FMP!&quot; The first volume of the series, titled &quot;Full Metal Panic! Family&quot;, was released on January 19, 2024.

The &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; light novel series has been adapted to manga on multiple occasions. The first manga series: &quot;Full Metal Panic&quot;, was serialized in Monthly Comic Dragon by Retsu Tateo. This manga was collected in nine &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes published from August 30, 2000, to July 1, 2005. Announced in July 2003, &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; became one of the first manga series licensed by ADV Manga. They released all of the volumes between November 10, 2003 and April 11, 2006.

A parallel series titled which focused more on the comedic elements from the franchise was also written by Retsu Tateo and ran for seven volumes between November 1, 2003, and September 1, 2006.

 was a spin-off series by Tomohiro Nagai. Five volumes were released between January 30, 2001, and April 1, 2003. &quot;Overload&quot; was licensed by ADV Manga in December 2004, and all of its volumes were published in English between June 6, 2005, and May 24, 2006.

=== Anime ===
==== &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; ====

The anime series was produced by Gonzo Digimation and originally aired in 2002 after its original air date was canceled because of the September 11 attacks. The series was licensed by ADV Films for North American release in 2003. The first three novels form the basis for the anime. The series was available on the Anime Network on Demand from 2003 to 2004.

The production of 3 director&#x27;s cut movies based on the first television series was announced in 2017. The &quot;1st SECTION Boy Meets Girl&quot; premiered on November 25, 2017, at Kadokawa Cinema Shinjuku in Japan, 
&quot;2nd SECTION One Night Stand&quot; premiered on January 13, 2018, and &quot;3rd SECTION Into the Blue&quot; premiered on January 20, 2018. Home video releases for the films were planned for February 28, 2018, for the 1st film, followed by March 28 for the 2nd film, and April 28 for the 3rd film.

==== &quot;Fumoffu&quot; ====

 is a companion series to the anime series &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; by Kyoto Animation, and takes place between the first season and &quot;The Second Raid&quot;. Markedly different in tone to the first series, &quot;Fumoffu&quot; is based on the more comical short stories Gatou published alongside the main novels, emphasizing the high school romantic comedy aspects of &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; with often crude humor and focuses on the romantic tension between Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori. It frequently parodies itself and anime stereotypes. None of the mecha combat or political intrigue, which characterized much of the original &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot;, can be seen in the series. The only reference to the mecha aspect of &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; is the Bonta-kun, which is one of the most prominent parodies in the anime. Sousuke uses spare Bonta-kun costumes to make highly effective suits of power armor, but they look like teddy bears wearing army gear and can only say: &quot;Fu&quot; and &quot;Mo&quot; in different combinations.

==== &quot;The Second Raid&quot; ====

 is the direct sequel to the original anime series. It was produced by Kyoto Animation and ran for 13 episodes. The series is based on the &quot;Ending Day by Day&quot; novels and takes place three months after the events that occurred in the &quot;Tuatha de Danaan&quot; at the end of the original &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; series. Mithril learns of a secret organization that has technology able to counter the ECS (Electronic Conceal System) mode. The organization, known as Amalgam, has access to &quot;Black Technology&quot;, which was obtained from the Whispered. Like the other intelligence agencies, Amalgam intends to obtain more. Sousuke&#x27;s mission to protect Chidori is terminated by Mithril, instead leaving her in the care of an anonymous agent known as &quot;Wraith&quot;.

There is a one episode OVA that takes place after &quot;Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid&quot;. It is a humorous stand-alone story. It focuses on the Captain of the Tuatha De Danaan: Teletha Tessa Testarossa, rather than the two main characters of the series. The OVA is based on short story &quot;Wari to Hima na Sentaichou no Ichi Nichi&quot; (&quot;A comparatively leisurely day of the squadron commander&quot;) in short story collection &quot;Dounimo Naranai Gori Muchuu&quot; (&quot;Helpless in the thick of it&quot;). The story is also told in chapters 13 &amp; 14 of &quot;Full Metal Panic Sigma&quot; manga volume 4.

Home video releases also included an &quot;episode 000&quot; and a 7-part Location Scouting in Hong Kong documentary. Episode 000 includes footage from various parts of the television broadcast episodes, but also includes new scenes. The Location Scouting in Hong Kong documentary includes various locations the television production staff members had gone to as inspiration for creating scenes used in the Hong Kong episodes, featuring appearances from the series producers, and commentaries from them.

==== &quot;Invisible Victory&quot; ====

 is the fourth TV series in the franchise. Kyoto Animation had not returned to produce the fourth anime adaptation. Instead, it was produced by studio Xebec. It premiered in April 2018. During Anime Expo 2017, the series creator confirmed that &quot;Full Metal Panic! Invisible Victory&quot; is a &quot;continuation&quot; that won&#x27;t contain any &quot;explanation or expository episodes.&quot; He stated that the pacing of the story is going to be &quot;full throttle from the get-go&quot; although it would still &quot;follow the original work pretty closely.&quot; The series consisted of 12 episodes. The opening song is &quot;Even...if&quot; and the ending song is &quot;Yes&quot;, both performed by Tamaru Yamada.

=== Live action film ===
A live action film adaptation was announced by Mandalay Pictures in April 2009, with Zac Efron rumored to be attached to the project. Efron has since confirmed a meeting took place regarding the project but added that the adaptation was unlikely to happen.

=== Video game ===
&quot;Full Metal Panic! Fight! Who Dares Wins&quot;, developed by B.B. Studio and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc., was released on May 31, 2018. Specialist Box limited edition includes Invisible Victory behind-the-scenes Blu-ray, a special novel by Shoji Gatoh, drama CD, replica autographed mini script of &quot;Megami no Rainichi: Date Hen,&quot; a case for the Blu-ray and CD, and a special Shiki Douji-illustrated box. Early purchases include download code for the &#x27;Armed Slave-Use Special Weapons Three Set&#x27; (Boxer 2nd Revision 76mm Shot Cannon (Armor-Piercing Ammunition) Cartridge Extension Model, ASG96-B Revision 57mm Glide Cannon, GRAW-X Single Molecule Cutter (Repulsion Field Prototype Model)).

== Reception ==
The second DVD volume of &quot;Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid&quot; was given a favorable review by Theron Martin of Anime News Network for pushing the character developments of Sousuke and Kaname as well as dramatic elements beyond comedy and action. Describing the impact of the volume, Martin explains that &quot;[t]he full impact of that [Sousuke and Kaname&#x27;s relationship] comes out beautifully in episode 7, when Kaname seeks out Sousuke in a moment of fear and, for the first time, Sousuke isn&#x27;t there for her. It&#x27;s one of those telling moments that can define an entire series.&quot;

THEM Anime Reviews has noted that the Arm Slaves, like most real life vehicles, are done so meticulously that fans of mecha series would &quot;scour online catalogues for tech books and sketches.&quot; Bureau 42 says that the &quot;mecha[Arm Slave] action in the show is very well done. While I can&#x27;t compare the action with other more grounded mecha shows like Patlabor, the combat is very well done and easy to follow, and visually interesting.&quot; Triforce commented that Arm Slave battles in the Full Metal Panic! series would be able to keep viewer&#x27;s attention to the show.

Negative criticism has surfaced on the role of the Arm Slaves throughout the &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; series. For instance, Ender&#x27;s review states that their mecha roles are confusing that the Arm Slaves are both &quot;08th MS Team soldiers and Dragon Ball Z-type fighters, hurling energy balls at each other and going &quot;Super Saiya-jin.&quot; Anime Database rated the &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot; series 4 out of 5 because of the Arm Slaves battles since they start out from being good to being very unrealistic. GameSpot Union comments on the relationship between the Arm Slaves and the animation done on &quot;Full Metal Panic!&quot;, saying both animation and camera views were bad.

The novels have over 11 million copies in print.

<text>The is a railway line in western Tokyo, Japan, owned by the private railway operator Keiō Corporation. It connects Shinjuku, Tokyo, with the suburban city of Hachiōji. The Keiō Line is part of a network with interchanges and through running to other lines of Keiō Corporation: the Keiō New Line, Keiō Sagamihara Line, the Keiō Keibajō Line, the Keiō Dōbutsuen Line, the Keiō Takao Line, and the gauge Keiō Inokashira Line.

==Services==
Six different types of limited-stop services are operated on the Keiō Line, along with local trains. Destinations are from Shinjuku unless otherwise indicated. English abbreviations are tentative for this article.
: Also known as for short. Until 2001 it was called .
; (R)
: Most services for Hashimoto and Keiō-Tama-Center on the Sagamihara Line, and Takaosanguchi on the Takao Line
; (SeE)
: Most bound for on the Sagamihara Line. Until 2013, these were weekday-only services called .
; (E)
:Most services run from the Toei Shinjuku Line locally and used as the express on the Sagamihara Line via Chōfu in mornings and evenings; other services in mornings and evenings are bound for Keiō-Hachiōji, Takaosanguchi and Takahatafudō.
; (SpE)
: Most services bound for Keiō-Hachiōji and Takaosanguchi can make the run from Shinjuku in 37 minutes and 39 minutes respectively.
; Mt. TAKAO (MT)
: Reserved-seat supplementary-fare services between Shinjuku and Takaosanguchi on the Takao Line. Services operate weekends and holidays with three round-trips. Trains to Takaosanguchi run nonstop after Meidaimae, while trains to Shinjuku make additional stops to receive passengers.
; (KL)
: Reserved-seat supplementary-fare services between Shinjuku and either Keiō-Hachiōji or Hashimoto. Services operate seven days a week, with services to Shinjuku in the morning and from Shinjuku in the evening. Fewer trains operate on weekends and holidays. On trains from Shinjuku, reserved seat tickets are only required up to the first train stop after Meidaimae, after which the train&#x27;s seats become unreserved.

== Stations ==
* All stations are located in Tokyo.
* Local trains stop at all stations.

==History==
The Shinjuku to Chōfu section opened in 1913 as a gauge interurban line electrified at 600 V DC, and was progressively extended in both directions so that the line connected Shinjuku and Fuchu in 1916. The Sasazuka to Fuchu section was double-tracked between 1920 and 1923.

The extension to Higashi-Hachiōji (now Keiō-Hachiōji) was completed by a related company, Gyokunan Electric Railway, in 1925. This electrified line was built to the Japanese standard narrow gauge of in an attempt to seek a government subsidy, and so trains from each railway could not operate on the other&#x27;s tracks. The subsidy application was rejected on the basis that the line competed with the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) Chūō Main Line, and so the Gyokunan Electric Railway merged with the Keiō Electric Railway Co., the line was regauged to 1,372 mm, and operation of trains from Shinjuku to Higashi-Hachiōji commenced in 1928.

The Fuchu to Nakagawara and Seiseki-Sakuragaoka to Kitano sections were double-tracked in 1929. In 1963, the original terminus at Shinjuku and the streetrunning section on what is today Japan National Route 20 towards Sasazuka Station was moved to an underground alignment. Additionally the overhead line voltage was increased to 1,500 V DC. The Nakagawara to Seiseki-Sakuragaoka section was double-tracked in 1964. The Kitano to Keiō-Hachiōji section was double-tracked in 1970, and the relocation of the terminal station underground was completed in 1989.

From the start of the revised timetable introduced on 25 September 2015, Semi Special Express services were also to stop at Sasazuka and Chitose-Karasuyama stations, and Semi Express services will also stop at Sengawa Station.

The flat junction west of Chofu station between the Keiō Line and Keiō Sagamihara Line has been a source of congestion in the entire Keiō network for years. Keiō has reconfigured the station and put the entire junction and Chofu Station underground to improve operations and separate traffic between the two lines. The underground section of the Keiō around Chofu Station to Kokuryo was completed in 2012.

=== Level crossings and congestion ===
The Keiō Line is infamous for its level crossings, of which the 25 lying on the section between Sasazuka and Sengawa stations are classified by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Construction Bureau as &quot;akazu no fumikiri&quot; as they are closed to road traffic for over 40 minutes in an hour. Congestion on the Keiō Line is also a concern, with trains often running as close as 1 minute apart during rush hours. In 2016, Keiō and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Construction Bureau proposed that the section between Sasazuka and Chofu be grade separated and widened to quadruple-track to reduce the effects caused by the present bunching on the existing at-grade double-tracked line. Later the proposal evolved to call for two separate sets of tracks each dedicated to express and local services, similar to the Keiō and Keiō New lines between Sasazuka and Shinjuku Stations. 

With the completion of the undergrounding between Chofu and Kokuryo Stations in 2012, construction has started on elevating the line between Sasazuka and Sengawa Stations. The government has planned the grade-separating project for this section of line to be completed by 2022, but this date has been delayed due to land acquisition issues. 

Keiō has proposed a later phase for the whole corridor, which involves building another pair of underground tracks for express services between Sasazuka and Chofu, completing the quadruple-tracking of the corridor until the bifurcation of the Keiō New Line. The design of Chofu Station after the completion of the undergrounding works in 2012 allows for the inclusion of another set of underground express tracks in the future.

<doc id="390257" wikidata="Q4115288" url="?curid=390257" title="Ratfor">
<text>Ratfor (short for &quot;Rational Fortran&quot;) is a programming language implemented as a preprocessor for Fortran 66. It provides modern control structures, unavailable in Fortran 66, to replace GOTOs and statement numbers.

== Features ==
Ratfor provides the following kinds of flow-control statements, described by Kernighan and Plauger as &quot;shamelessly stolen from the language C, developed for the UNIX operating system by D.M. Ritchie&quot; (&quot;Software Tools&quot;, p. 318):

* statement grouping with braces
* if-else, while, for, do, repeat-until, break, next
* &quot;free-form&quot; statements, i.e., not constrained by Fortran format rules
* &lt;, &gt;, &gt;=, ... in place of .LT., .GT., .GE., ...
* include
* # comments

For example, the following code

if (a &gt; b) {
 max = a
} else {
 max = b

might be translated as

 IF(.NOT.(A.GT.B))GOTO 1
 MAX = A
 GOTO 2
 1 CONTINUE
 MAX = B
 2 CONTINUE

The version of Ratfor in &quot;Software Tools&quot; is written in Ratfor, as are the sample programs, and inasmuch as its own translation to Fortran is available, it can be ported to any Fortran system. Ratfor source code file names end in .r or .rat.

== History ==
Ratfor was designed and implemented by Brian Kernighan at Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1974, and described in &quot;Software—Practice &amp; Experience&quot; in 1975. It was used in the book &quot;Software Tools&quot; (Kernighan and Plauger, 1976).

In 1977, at Purdue University, an improved version of the Ratfor preprocessor was written. It was called Mouse4, as it was smaller and faster than Ratfor. A published document by Dr. Douglas Comer, professor at Purdue, concluded &quot;contrary to the evidence exhibited by the designer of Ratfor, sequential search is often inadequate for production software. Furthermore, in the case of lexical analysis, well-known techniques do seem to offer efficiency while retaining the simplicity, ease of coding and modularity of ad hoc methods.&quot; (CSD-TR236).

In comparison to the Ratfor preprocessor on a program of 3000 source lines running on a CDC 6500 system took 185.470 CPU seconds. That was cut by 50% when binary search was used in the Ratfor code. Rewriting the ad hoc lexical scanner using a standard method based on finite automata reduced run time to 12.723 seconds.

With the availability of Fortran 77, a successor named Ratfiv (Ratfor=rat4 =&gt; rat5=Ratfiv) could, with an option /f77, output a more readable Fortran 77 code:

 IF (A .GT. B) THEN
 MAX = A
 ELSE
 MAX = B
 ENDIF
Initial Ratfor source code was ported to C in 1985 and improved to produce Fortran 77 code too. A git tree has been set in 2010 in order to revive ratfor
Although the GNU C compiler had the ability to directly compile a Ratfor file (.r) without keeping a useless intermediate Fortran code (.f) (codice_1), this functionality was lost in version 4 during the move in 2005 from f77 to GNU Fortran.

The original source was available in .deb and .rpm forms at its original site, mirror.corbina.net/mandriva/, and its archive, www.dgate.org/ratfor/ are gone as of April, 2024.

== Ratfiv ==
Ratfiv is an enhanced version of the Ratfor programming language, a preprocessor for Fortran designed to give it C-like capabilities. Fortran was widely used for scientific programming but had very basic control-flow primitives (&quot;do&quot; and &quot;goto&quot;) and no &quot;macro&quot; facility which limited its expressiveness.

The name of the language is a pun (&quot;Ratfor&quot; (RATional FORtran) -&gt; &quot;Rat Four&quot; -&gt; &quot;Rat Five&quot; -&gt; &quot;RatFiv&quot;).

Ratfiv was developed by Bill Wood at the Institute for Cancer Research, Philadelphia, PA in the early 1980s and released on several DECUS (Digital Equipment Users Group) SIG (Special Interest Group) tapes. It is based on the original Ratfor by B. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger, with rewrites and enhancements by David Hanson and friends (U. of Arizona), Joe Sventek and Debbie Scherrer (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory).

Ratfiv V2.1 was distributed on the DECUS RSX82a SIG tape.

<doc id="390261" wikidata="Q2877155" url="?curid=390261" title="BLISS">
<text>BLISS is a system programming language developed at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) by W. A. Wulf, D. B. Russell, and A. N. Habermann around 1970. It was perhaps the best known system language until C debuted a few years later. Since then, C became popular and common, and BLISS faded into obscurity. When C was in its infancy, a few projects within Bell Labs debated the merits of BLISS vs. C.

BLISS is a typeless block-structured programming language based on expressions rather than statements, and includes constructs for exception handling, coroutines, and macros. It does not include a goto statement.

The name is variously said to be short for &quot;Basic Language for Implementation of System Software&quot; or &quot;System Software Implementation Language, Backwards&quot;. However, in his 2015 oral history for the Babbage Institute&#x27;s Computer Security History Project, Wulf claimed that the acronym was originally based on the name &quot;Bill&#x27;s Language for Implementing System Software.&quot;

The original Carnegie Mellon compiler was notable for its extensive use of optimizations, and formed the basis of the classic book &quot;The Design of an Optimizing Compiler&quot;.

Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) developed and maintained BLISS compilers for the PDP-10, PDP-11, VAX, DEC PRISM, MIPS, DEC Alpha, and Intel IA-32, The language did not become popular among customers and few had the compiler, but DEC used it heavily in-house into the 1980s; most of the utility programs for the OpenVMS operating system were written in BLISS-32. The DEC BLISS compiler has been ported to the IA-64 and x86-64 architectures as part of the ports of OpenVMS to these platforms. The x86-64 BLISS compiler uses LLVM as its backend code generator, replacing the proprietary GEM backend used for Alpha and IA-64.

== Language description ==

The BLISS language has the following characteristics:

* All &quot;constants&quot; are full word for the machine being used, e.g. on a 16-bit machine such as the PDP-11, a constant is 16 bits; on a VAX computer, constants are 32 bits, and on a PDP-10, a constant is 36 bits.
* A &quot;reference to a variable&quot; is always to the address of that variable. For example, the instruction codice_1 refers to adding 8 to the &quot;address&quot; of Z, not to its &quot;value&quot;. If one needs to add 8 to the &quot;value&quot; of Z, one must prefix the variable with a period; so one would type codice_2 to perform this function, which adds 8 to the &quot;contents&quot; of Z.
* &quot;Assignment&quot; is done with the standard codice_3 symbol, e.g. codice_4 – which says to create a full-word constant containing 8, and store it in the location whose address corresponds to that of Z. So codice_5 (or, alternatively codice_6 though this form is considered bad practice per the BLISS documentation in Digital) places the constant 14 into the location which is 12 words after the address of Z.
* &quot;Block statements&quot; are similar to those of ALGOL: a block is started with a codice_7 statement and terminated with codice_8. As with ALGOL, statements are separated with the semicolon (&quot;;&quot;). When a value is computed, it is saved until the next statement terminator – which means that a value can be computed, assigned to a variable, and carried forward to the next statement, if desired. Alternatively, an open parenthesis may be used to begin a block, with the close parenthesis used to close the block. When parentheses are included in an expression, the standard precedence rules are used, in which parenthesized expressions are computed first,
* &quot;Conditional execution&quot; uses the codice_9 expression, which tests a true-false condition, performs alternative actions, and returns a result.
* &quot;Comparison&quot; uses keywords such as codice_10 for equality (as opposed to overloading the = symbol for the same purpose), codice_11 for Greater Than, and codice_12 for not equal. For example, the following code will assign the absolute value of Z to the address indicated by Q:

::codice_13

* &quot;Identifiers&quot; (variables and constants) must be declared before use, typically using the codice_14 keyword. Declaring a variable normally causes the compiler to allocate space for it; when necessary, a variable may be assigned a fixed machine address via the codice_15 declaration. This feature is primarily used for accessing either machine registers or certain special addresses.
* &quot;Subroutines&quot; in the language are called &quot;routines&quot;, and are declared with the keyword codice_16.
* &quot;Macros&quot;, which allow for text substitution, are declared with the keyword codice_17.
* The language supports &quot;arrays&quot;, which are referred to as &quot;structures&quot;, and declared with the keyword codice_18.
* The language supports some &quot;high-level programming language constructs&quot; such as:
**&quot;Alternative execution paths&quot; via the codice_19 expression
**&quot;Looping&quot; through use of the codice_20 expression, which is similar to ALGOL&#x27;s FOR statement
**Built-in &quot;string functions&quot;
**Certain automatic &quot;data conversions&quot; (number to string, etc.)

==Source example==
The following example is taken verbatim from the &quot;Bliss Language Manual&quot;:
MODULE E1 (MAIN = CTRL) =
BEGIN
FORWARD ROUTINE
 CTRL,
 STEP;
ROUTINE CTRL =
! This routine inputs a value, operates on it, and
! then outputs the result.
 BEGIN
 EXTERNAL ROUTINE
 GETNUM, ! Input a number from terminal
 PUTNUM; ! Output a number to terminal
 LOCAL
 X, ! Storage for input value
 Y; ! Storage for output value
 GETNUM(X);
 Y = STEP(.X);
 PUTNUM(.Y)
 END;
ROUTINE STEP(A) =
! This routine adds 1 to the given value.
 (.A+1);
END

<text>Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language designed to run on the Java platform. It was known as JPython until 1999.

==Overview==
Jython programs can import and use any Java class. Except for some standard modules, Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules. Jython includes almost all of the modules in the standard Python programming language distribution, lacking only some of the modules implemented originally in C. For example, a user interface in Jython could be written with Swing, AWT or SWT. Jython compiles Python source code to Java bytecode (an intermediate language) either on demand or statically.

==History==
Jython was initially created in late 1997 to replace C with Java for performance-intensive code accessed by Python programs, moving to SourceForge in October 2000. The Python Software Foundation awarded a grant in January 2005. Jython 2.5 was released in June 2009.

==Status and roadmap==
The most recent release is Jython 2.7.4. It was released on August 18, 2024 and is compatible with Python 2.7.

Python 3 compatible changes are planned in Jython 3 Roadmap. 

Although Jython implements the Python language specification, it has some differences and incompatibilities with CPython, which is the reference implementation of Python.

==License terms==
From version 2.2 on, Jython (including the standard library) is released under the Python Software Foundation License (v2). Older versions are covered by the &quot;Jython 2.0, 2.1 license&quot; and the &quot;JPython 1.1.x Software License&quot;.

The command-line interpreter is available under the Apache Software License.

==Usage==
* JBoss Application Server&#x27;s command line interface scripting using Jython

<doc id="390266" wikidata="Q4955157" url="?curid=390266" title="Brady Anderson">
<text>Brady Kevin Anderson (born January 18, 1964) is an American former baseball outfielder and executive who played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (1988–2002) for the Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles and Cleveland Indians. He spent the majority of his career as a center fielder and leadoff hitter for the Orioles in the 1990s, where he was a three-time All Star, and, in 1996, became the 15th player in major league history to hit 50 home runs in one season. Anderson bats and throws left-handed, stands tall, and weighs .

A native of Silver Spring, Maryland, Anderson was selected by the Red Sox in the tenth round of the 1985 amateur draft. His 50 home runs in 1996 set an Orioles team record until surpassed by Chris Davis in 2013. With 53 stolen bases in 1992, Anderson became the first player in major league history to have achieved separate season totals of both 50 home runs and 50 stolen bases. He was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, on January 18, 1964, and attended Carlsbad High School in Carlsbad, California. He went on to study economics at the University of California, Irvine where he played outfield and first base for the Anteaters. He left college following his junior season after being drafted in the 10th round of the 1985 Major League Baseball draft by the Boston Red Sox.

==Baseball career==

===1988–1991===
Anderson made his major league debut on April 4, 1988. Batting .230 with 12 runs batted in (RBI) and 4 stolen bases, he was optioned on June 4, 1988 to the Pawtucket Red Sox where he hit .287 in 49 games. He was traded along with Curt Schilling to Baltimore for Mike Boddicker on July 29, 1988, two days prior to the non-waivers trade deadline. He was the key player acquired by the Orioles who needed a center fielder and leadoff batter. Anderson hit his first major league home run on August 6, 1988 versus Milwaukee&#x27;s Tom Filer at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore.

===1992===
In only his first season as a full-time player in , Anderson played in all but three of the Orioles games and led the major leagues with 749 plate appearances. He earned his first of three All-Star nominations and played in the 1992 All-Star Game at San Diego on July 14. By season&#x27;s end, he had become the first player in American League history to reach 20 homers, 50 steals and 75 RBI in a season. Anderson finished 15th in AL MVP voting.

===1993===
Despite missing 15 games with chicken pox and patellar tendinitis in both knees, Anderson led all American League leadoff hitters in extra-base hits (56) and RBI (62). He also led the Orioles in eight offensive categories, including runs scored (87), stolen bases (24), walks (82), triples (8), and extra base hits (57). He batted .571 (8-14) with the bases loaded, the fourth highest total in the American League.

===1994===
The 1994 season was cut short two months by the player&#x27;s strike. Anderson led all American League left fielders with a 1.000 fielding percentage, and his 31 stolen bases in 32 attempts was a major league record for 25 or more steals.

===1995===
On June 12, Anderson set an American League record with 34 consecutive stolen bases. The streak ended on July 3 at 36 when he was caught by Minnesota Twins catcher Matt Walbeck. His record was eclipsed by Chicago&#x27;s Tim Raines later in the year and was matched by Toronto&#x27;s Paul Molitor. Anderson was the hardest to double up in the American League, grounding into only three double plays on the year: once every 184.7 at-bats. He hit two home runs on September 5, the night teammate Cal Ripken Jr. tied Lou Gehrig&#x27;s consecutive games played record of 2,130. On September 6, Anderson spoke on behalf of his teammates at a post-game ceremony honoring Ripken&#x27;s 2,131st consecutive game.

===1996===
Anderson went into the final game of the 1996 season (visiting the Toronto Blue Jays) with 49 home runs. In his first at-bat, he hit his 50th homer off Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen, breaking Frank Robinson&#x27;s record for most home runs in a season by a Baltimore Oriole. He also became the first player in major league history to be in the 50–20 club and the 20–50 clubs. Anderson also shattered a major league record by leading off four consecutive games with a home run. The previous mark was two straight games, done 33 times. In the annual &quot;Baseball America&quot; &quot;Tools of the Trade&quot; poll, Anderson was named as the league&#x27;s third-best defensive outfielder, behind only Seattle&#x27;s Ken Griffey Jr. and Cleveland&#x27;s Kenny Lofton. Anderson also hit 37 doubles and five triples and led the American League in extra base hits with 92, breaking the Orioles club record previously held by Cal Ripken Jr.

Anderson had more than doubled his previous best of 21 home runs in 1992, and his uncharacteristic power surge has since led to allegations that he used performance-enhancing drugs during the 1996 season.

===1997===
Despite playing most of the 1997 season with a broken rib, Anderson led the Orioles to a wire-to-wire American League East title with a record of 98-64. Anderson made his third All-Star appearance at the 1997 All-Star Game in Cleveland, where he played the entire game in the leadoff spot for the American League and went 2 for 4 with a double high off the 19-foot left field wall against pitcher Curt Schilling.

Anderson led the Orioles in 13 offensive categories: batting average (.288), on-base percentage (.393), OPS (.862), plate appearances (696), runs scored (97), hits (170), doubles (39), triples (7), walks (84), stolen bases (18), and extra base hits (tied with Rafael Palmeiro – 64). He was hit by pitches a league-leading 19 times, marking the second straight year he led the league.

===1998===
Anderson appeared on the cover of the Konami video game &quot;Bottom of the 9th &#x27;99&quot;. The game was released on August 31, 1998, for the PlayStation.

===1999===
In 1999, Anderson rebounded from an injury-plagued 1998 campaign for one of the best all-around seasons of his career. He led American League leadoff hitters with a .408 on-base percentage and reached base 279 times, ninth most in the league. For the season, Anderson batted .282 with 28 doubles, 5 triples, 24 home runs, 109 runs scored, 81 runs batted in, 36 stolen bases, 96 walks, and 24 hit by pitch. He became the only leadoff hitter in history with three 75 RBI seasons to his credit. On May 23, Anderson became the first player in American League history to be hit by a pitch twice in the same inning. He broke his own American League record for hit by pitch in a season by a left-handed batter, set in 1996. The previous record was held by Washington&#x27;s Henry Homer Doc Gessler, who was hit 20 times in 1911. In a post-season statistical analysis by &quot;Baseball America&quot;, Anderson was rated as the best leadoff hitter in the American League.

===2000–2003===
With one year remaining on a five-year contract, Anderson was released by the Orioles on November 16, 2001 after a season in which he batted .202 with eight home runs and 45 RBI in 131 games. He currently holds the Orioles career stolen base record with 311. He signed a one-year contract with club options for 2003 and 2004 with the Indians three weeks later on December 6. The transaction cost the Indians the $200,000 minimum, while the Orioles had to pay $4,000,000. He hit 13-for-80 for a .163 average with one homer and five RBI in 34 games before he was released by the Indians on May 21, 2002. He signed a minor-league contract with the San Diego Padres on December 9, 2002. He accepted an assignment to the Portland Beavers on March 27, 2003 after his attempt to make the Padres&#x27; Opening Day roster was not successful. He was released by the Beavers 38 days later on May 4.

===Postseason===
In four post-season series, (Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees in 1996, Cleveland Indians and Seattle Mariners in 1997) Anderson had 80 at bats, 16 runs scored, 4 doubles, 6 home runs, a .300 batting average, a .380 on-base percentage, and a .575 slugging percentage.

In the 1997 playoffs, Anderson hit .353 against Seattle with a .588 slugging average and a .360 batting average against Cleveland with a .680 slugging average.

===Legacy===
Anderson still ranks among the top ten in Orioles/St. Louis Browns career statistics in:

* Games (1759 - 6th place)
* At-bats (6,271 - 6th)
* Plate Appearances (7,464 - 4th)
* Runs (1,044 - 5th)
* Total Bases (2,698 - 7th)
* Hits (1,614 - 6th)
* Doubles (329 - 6th)
* Triples (64 - 10th)
* Home Runs (209 - 8th) 
* RBI (744 - 10th)
* Extra Base Hits (602 - 4th) 
* Stolen Bases (307 - 2nd)
* Walks (927 - 3rd)
* Times Hit By Pitch (148 - 1st)
* Stolen Base % (75.8% - 5th)
* Power-Speed # (248.7 - 1st)
* Times on Base (2,689 - 5th)
* Intentional Walks (71 - 7th)
* Runs Created (1,094 - 5th)

He also holds the franchise&#x27;s single-season record for total bases (369 in 1996) and times hit by pitch (24 in 1999).

=== 1996 season ===
For 17 seasons, Anderson&#x27;s 1996 output of 50 home runs and 92 extra base hits were also single-season records for the Orioles/Browns franchise. Chris Davis surpassed Anderson&#x27;s career year in both categories in 2013.

As of 2016, Anderson is one of only two players (the other being Barry Bonds) to have stolen 50 or more bases in a season (53 in 1992) and hit 50 or more home runs in a season (50 in 1996). For posterity, Bonds stole 52 bases in 1990 and hit 73 home runs in 2001.

Anderson was not able to duplicate his 50 home run season; in fact, his next best power season came in 1999, when he hit 24 homers. However, for a nine-year stretch from 1992–2000, Anderson annually averaged 21 home runs, 6 triples, 31 doubles, 96 runs scored, 70 RBI, 27 stolen bases, a .376 on base average, a .462 slugging average, and 14 times hit by a pitch. Anderson attained these figures despite one season shortened two months by a player strike (1994) and another shortened one month by owner lockout (1995).

=== Player profile ===
A left-handed hitter and thrower, Anderson&#x27;s combination of power and speed made him a unique leadoff hitter: Anderson reached three All-Star Games and earned AL Most Valuable Player votes in two different seasons. The power-speed combination was so rare, he remains the only player to steal 50 bases and hit 20 home runs in one season (1992), then record at least 50 home runs and 20 steals in another (1996).

Anderson&#x27;s breakout year in 1992 and subsequent success marked a dramatic reversal of his first four years in Major League Baseball, where he&#x27;d failed to hit better than .231 in any season, becoming the first outfielder to do so according to Elias Sports Bureau.

Much of the career turnaround owed to Anderson&#x27;s commitment to cross training and fitness exercises. And reversing seemingly negative trends eventually became Anderson&#x27;s trademark: after ranking in the top 10 in times caught stealing the previous two seasons, Anderson stole 31 bases in 32 attempts in the strike-shortened 1994 season. The 96.9% stolen base percentage remains the highest percentage for players who recorded at least 25 stolen bases in a season.

==Honors==
On August 21, 2004, Anderson was inducted into the Baltimore Orioles Hall of Fame. Cal Ripken Jr. introduced Anderson and called him &quot;the greatest lead-off hitter in Orioles baseball, and the best athlete I have ever played with.&quot; During Ripken&#x27;s induction ceremony to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007, he described Anderson as &quot;simply my best friend&quot;.

== After baseball ==

=== Front office ===
Anderson was named Special Assistant to the Executive Vice-President for Baseball Operations by the Orioles on January 19, 2012. He was promoted to Vice-President of Baseball Operations one year later on February 19, 2013. He left the organization at the conclusion of the 2019 season as a result of his role being significantly reduced after Mike Elias replaced Dan Duquette in charge of the team&#x27;s baseball operations.

=== Acting and personal life ===
Anderson appeared on an episode of the television sitcom &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;. It was the Season 1, Episode 14 titled, &quot;Sabrina Through the Looking Glass,&quot; which originally aired on January 17, 1997.

Anderson appeared in the 2011 movie The Absent, and was credited as &quot;baseball player.&quot;

In 2020, Anderson began dating South Korean-American singer, actress and ballerina Stephanie, whom he met in Los Angeles in 2012.

===Work in Japan===
Brady Anderson joined Ripken on a journey to Japan, the first trip for Anderson as a &quot;sports diplomat&quot;. Anderson was an obvious choice for a companion for Ripken who said that Anderson is someone who &quot;could help on the mission, spread goodwill and be with kids&quot;. Anderson and Ripken were joined by Japanese baseball player Sachio Kinugasa. The trip took place November 8–16, 2011, and included visits to several towns (Tokyo, Ofunato, Nishinomiya, and Kyoto) affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. During the trip to Japan, Anderson and Ripken hosted baseball and softball clinics, as well as motivational activities.

<text>In mathematics, the Legendre transformation (or Legendre transform), first introduced by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1787 when studying the minimal surface problem, is an involutive transformation on real-valued functions that are convex on a real variable. Specifically, if a real-valued multivariable function is convex on one of its independent real variables, then the Legendre transform with respect to this variable is applicable to the function. 

In physical problems, the Legendre transform is used to convert functions of one quantity (such as position, pressure, or temperature) into functions of the conjugate quantity (momentum, volume, and entropy, respectively). In this way, it is commonly used in classical mechanics to derive the Hamiltonian formalism out of the Lagrangian formalism (or vice versa) and in thermodynamics to derive the thermodynamic potentials, as well as in the solution of differential equations of several variables. 

For sufficiently smooth functions on the real line, the Legendre transform formula_1 of a function formula_2 can be specified, up to an additive constant, by the condition that the functions&#x27; first derivatives are inverse functions of each other. This can be expressed in Euler&#x27;s derivative notation as
formula_3 where formula_4 is an operator of differentiation, formula_5 represents an argument or input to the associated function, formula_6 is an inverse function such that formula_7, or equivalently, as formula_8 and formula_9 in Lagrange&#x27;s notation.

The generalization of the Legendre transformation to affine spaces and non-convex functions is known as the convex conjugate (also called the Legendre–Fenchel transformation), which can be used to construct a function&#x27;s convex hull.

==Definition==

===Definition in one-dimensional real space===
Let formula_10 be an interval, and formula_11 a convex function; then the &quot;Legendre transform&quot; &quot;of&quot; formula_2 is the function formula_13 defined by
formula_14
where formula_15 denotes the supremum over formula_16, e.g., formula_17 in formula_18 is chosen such that formula_19 is maximized at each formula_20, or formula_20 is such that formula_22 has a bounded value throughout formula_18 (e.g., when formula_24 is a linear function).

The function formula_1 is called the convex conjugate function of formula_2. For historical reasons (rooted in analytic mechanics), the conjugate variable is often denoted formula_27, instead of formula_28. If the convex function formula_2 is defined on the whole line and is everywhere differentiable, then
formula_30
can be interpreted as the negative of the formula_31-intercept of the tangent line to the graph of formula_2 that has slope formula_27.

===Definition in n-dimensional real space===
The generalization to convex functions formula_34 on a convex set formula_35 is straightforward: formula_36 has domain
formula_37
and is defined by
formula_38
where formula_39 denotes the dot product of formula_28 and formula_41.

The Legendre transformation is an application of the duality relationship between points and lines. The functional relationship specified by formula_2 can be represented equally well as a set of formula_43 points, or as a set of tangent lines specified by their slope and intercept values.

===Understanding the Legendre transform in terms of derivatives===

For a differentiable convex function formula_2 on the real line with the first derivative formula_45 and its inverse formula_46, the Legendre transform of formula_2, formula_48, can be specified, up to an additive constant, by the condition that the functions&#x27; first derivatives are inverse functions of each other, i.e., formula_49 and formula_50.

To see this, first note that if formula_51 as a convex function on the real line is differentiable and formula_52 is a critical point of the function of formula_53, then the supremum is achieved at formula_54 (by convexity, see the first figure in this Wikipedia page). Therefore, the Legendre transform of formula_51 is formula_56.

Then, suppose that the first derivative formula_45 is invertible and let the inverse be formula_58. Then for each formula_59, the point formula_60 is the unique critical point formula_54 of the function formula_62 (i.e., formula_63) because formula_64 and the function&#x27;s first derivative with respect to formula_41 at formula_60 is formula_67. Hence we have formula_68 for each formula_59. By differentiating with respect to formula_59, we find 
formula_71
Since formula_72 this simplifies to formula_73. In other words, &quot;formula_74 and formula_45 are inverses to each other&quot;.

In general, if formula_76 as the inverse of formula_77 then formula_78 so integration gives formula_79 with a constant formula_80

In practical terms, given formula_81 the parametric plot of formula_82 versus formula_83 amounts to the graph of formula_84 versus formula_85

In some cases (e.g. thermodynamic potentials, below), a non-standard requirement is used, amounting to an alternative definition of with a &quot;minus sign&quot;,
formula_86

=== Formal definition in physics context ===
In analytical mechanics and thermodynamics, Legendre transformation is usually defined as follows: suppose formula_2 is a function of formula_41; then we have 

::formula_89

Performing the Legendre transformation on this function means that we take formula_90 as the independent variable, so that the above expression can be written as

::formula_91

and according to Leibniz&#x27;s rule formula_92 we then have 

::formula_93

and taking formula_94 we have formula_95 which means 

::formula_96

When formula_2 is a function of formula_98 variables formula_99, then we can perform the Legendre transformation on each one or several variables: we have 

::formula_100

where formula_101 Then if we want to perform the Legendre transformation on, e.g. formula_102, then we take formula_103 together with formula_104 as independent variables, and with Leibniz&#x27;s rule we have 

::formula_105

So for the function formula_106 we have

::formula_107

We can also do this transformation for variables formula_104. If we do it to all the variables, then we have 

::formula_109 where formula_110

In analytical mechanics, people perform this transformation on variables formula_111 of the Lagrangian formula_112 to get the Hamiltonian:

formula_113

In thermodynamics, people perform this transformation on variables according to the type of thermodynamic system they want; for example, starting from the cardinal function of state, the internal energy formula_114, we have

::formula_115

so we can perform the Legendre transformation on either or both of formula_116 to yield

::formula_117 

::formula_118

::formula_119

and each of these three expressions has a physical meaning.

This definition of the Legendre transformation is the one originally introduced by Legendre in his work in 1787, and is still applied by physicists nowadays. Indeed, this definition can be mathematically rigorous if we treat all the variables and functions defined above: for example, formula_120 as differentiable functions defined on an open set of formula_121 or on a differentiable manifold, and formula_122 their differentials (which are treated as cotangent vector field in the context of differentiable manifold). This definition is equivalent to the modern mathematicians&#x27; definition as long as formula_123 is differentiable and convex for the variables formula_124

==Properties==
*The Legendre transform of a convex function, of which double derivative values are all positive, is also a convex function of which double derivative values are all positive.&quot;Proof.&quot; Let us show this with a doubly differentiable function formula_24 with all positive double derivative values and with a bijective (invertible) derivative. For a fixed formula_27, let formula_127 maximize or make the function formula_128 bounded over formula_41. Then the Legendre transformation of formula_2 is formula_131, thus,formula_132by the maximizing or bounding condition formula_133. Note that formula_127 depends on formula_135. (This can be visually shown in the 1st figure of this page above.) Thus formula_136 where formula_137, meaning that formula_138 is the inverse of formula_45 that is the derivative of formula_2 (so formula_141). Note that formula_138 is also differentiable with the following derivative (Inverse function rule),formula_143Thus, the Legendre transformation formula_144 is the composition of differentiable functions, hence it is differentiable. Applying the product rule and the chain rule with the found equality formula_136 yieldsformula_146giving formula_147so formula_1 is convex with its double derivatives are all positive.
* The Legendre transformation is an involution, i.e., formula_149. &quot;Proof.&quot; By using the above identities as formula_150, formula_136, formula_131 and its derivative formula_153, formula_154Note that this derivation does not require the condition to have all positive values in double derivative of the original function formula_2.

== Identities ==
As shown above, for a convex function formula_24, with formula_157 maximizing or making formula_128 bounded at each formula_27 to define the Legendre transform formula_131 and with formula_137, the following identities hold.

* formula_150,
* formula_136,
* formula_153.

==Examples==

===Example 1===

Consider the exponential function formula_165 which has the domain formula_166. From the definition, the Legendre transform is 
formula_167
where formula_168 remains to be determined. To evaluate the supremum, compute the derivative of formula_169 with respect to formula_41 and set equal to zero:
formula_171
The second derivative formula_172 is negative everywhere, so the maximal value is achieved at formula_173. Thus, the Legendre transform is
formula_174
and has domain formula_175 This illustrates that the domains of a function and its Legendre transform can be different. 

To find the Legendre transformation of the Legendre transformation of formula_51, 
formula_177
where a variable formula_178 is intentionally used as the argument of the function formula_179 to show the involution property of the Legendre transform as formula_180. we compute
formula_181
thus the maximum occurs at formula_182 because the second derivative formula_183 where formula_127 is a point in maximizing or making formula_185 bounded for given and ). Since the new independent variable of the transform with respect to is , the differentials and in devolve to and in the differential of the transform, i.e., we build another function with its differential expressed in terms of the new basis and .

We thus consider the function so that
formula_186
formula_187
formula_188

The function is the Legendre transform of , where only the independent variable has been supplanted by . This is widely used in thermodynamics, as illustrated below.

==Applications==

===Analytical mechanics===
A Legendre transform is used in classical mechanics to derive the Hamiltonian formulation from the Lagrangian formulation, and conversely. A typical Lagrangian has the form

formula_189
where formula_190 are coordinates on , is a positive definite real matrix, and
formula_191

For every fixed, formula_192 is a convex function of formula_193, while formula_194 plays the role of a constant.

Hence the Legendre transform of formula_192 as a function of formula_193 is the Hamiltonian function,
formula_197

In a more general setting, formula_198 are local coordinates on the tangent bundle formula_199 of a manifold formula_200. For each , formula_192 is a convex function of the tangent space . The Legendre transform gives the Hamiltonian formula_202 as a function of the coordinates of the cotangent bundle formula_203; the inner product used to define the Legendre transform is inherited from the pertinent canonical symplectic structure. In this abstract setting, the Legendre transformation corresponds to the tautological one-form.

===Thermodynamics===
The strategy behind the use of Legendre transforms in thermodynamics is to shift from a function that depends on a variable to a new (conjugate) function that depends on a new variable, the conjugate of the original one. The new variable is the partial derivative of the original function with respect to the original variable. The new function is the difference between the original function and the product of the old and new variables. Typically, this transformation is useful because it shifts the dependence of, e.g., the energy from an extensive variable to its conjugate intensive variable, which can often be controlled more easily in a physical experiment.

For example, the internal energy is an explicit function of the &quot;extensive variables&quot; entropy , volume &quot;&quot;, and chemical composition (e.g., formula_204)
formula_205
which has a total differential
formula_206

where formula_207.

(Subscripts are not necessary by the definition of partial derivatives but left here for clarifying variables.) Stipulating some common reference state, by using the (non-standard) Legendre transform of the internal energy with respect to volume , the enthalpy may be obtained as the following.

To get the (standard) Legendre transform formula_208 of the internal energy with respect to volume , the function formula_209 is defined first, then it shall be maximized or bounded by . To do this, the condition formula_210 needs to be satisfied, so formula_211 is obtained. This approach is justified because is a linear function with respect to (so a convex function on ) by the definition of extensive variables. The non-standard Legendre transform here is obtained by negating the standard version, so formula_212.

 is definitely a state function as it is obtained by adding ( and as state variables) to a state function formula_213, so its differential is an exact differential. Because of formula_214 and the fact that it must be an exact differential, formula_215.

The enthalpy is suitable for description of processes in which the pressure is controlled from the surroundings.

It is likewise possible to shift the dependence of the energy from the extensive variable of entropy, , to the (often more convenient) intensive variable , resulting in the Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies. The Helmholtz free energy , and Gibbs energy , are obtained by performing Legendre transforms of the internal energy and enthalpy, respectively,
formula_216formula_217

The Helmholtz free energy is often the most useful thermodynamic potential when temperature and volume are controlled from the surroundings, while the Gibbs energy is often the most useful when temperature and pressure are controlled from the surroundings.

===Variable capacitor===
As another example from physics, consider a parallel conductive plate capacitor, in which the plates can move relative to one another. Such a capacitor would allow transfer of the electric energy which is stored in the capacitor into external mechanical work, done by the force acting on the plates. One may think of the electric charge as analogous to the &quot;charge&quot; of a gas in a cylinder, with the resulting mechanical force exerted on a piston.

Compute the force on the plates as a function of , the distance which separates them. To find the force, compute the potential energy, and then apply the definition of force as the gradient of the potential energy function.

The electrostatic potential energy stored in a capacitor of the capacitance and a positive electric charge or negative charge on each conductive plate is (with using the definition of the capacitance as formula_218),

formula_219

where the dependence on the area of the plates, the dielectric constant of the insulation material between the plates, and the separation are abstracted away as the capacitance . (For a parallel plate capacitor, this is proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the separation.)

The force between the plates due to the electric field created by the charge separation is then
formula_220

If the capacitor is not connected to any electric circuit, then the &quot;electric charges&quot; on the plates remain constant and the voltage varies when the plates move with respect to each other, and the force is the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential energy as
formula_221

where formula_222 as the charge is fixed in this configuration.

However, instead, suppose that the &quot;voltage&quot; between the plates is maintained constant as the plate moves by connection to a battery, which is a reservoir for electric charges at a constant potential difference. Then the amount of &quot;charges&quot; formula_223 &quot;is a variable&quot; instead of the voltage; formula_223 and formula_225 are the Legendre conjugate to each other. To find the force, first compute the non-standard Legendre transform formula_208 with respect to formula_223 (also with using formula_218),

formula_229

This transformation is possible because formula_230 is now a linear function of formula_223 so is convex on it. The force now becomes the negative gradient of this Legendre transform, resulting in the same force obtained from the original function formula_230,
formula_233

The two conjugate energies formula_230 and formula_235 happen to stand opposite to each other (their signs are opposite), only because of the linearity of the capacitance—except now is no longer a constant. They reflect the two different pathways of storing energy into the capacitor, resulting in, for instance, the same &quot;pull&quot; between a capacitor&#x27;s plates.

===Probability theory===
In large deviations theory, the &quot;rate function&quot; is defined as the Legendre transformation of the logarithm of the moment generating function of a random variable. An important application of the rate function is in the calculation of tail probabilities of sums of i.i.d. random variables, in particular in Cramér&#x27;s theorem.

If formula_236 are i.i.d. random variables, let formula_237 be the associated random walk and formula_238 the moment generating function of formula_239. For formula_240, formula_241. Hence, by Markov&#x27;s inequality, one has for formula_242 and formula_243
formula_244
where formula_245. Since the left-hand side is independent of formula_246, we may take the infimum of the right-hand side, which leads one to consider the supremum of formula_247, i.e., the Legendre transform of formula_248, evaluated at formula_249.

===Microeconomics===
Legendre transformation arises naturally in microeconomics in the process of finding the &quot;supply&quot; of some product given a fixed price on the market knowing the cost function , i.e. the cost for the producer to make/mine/etc. units of the given product.

A simple theory explains the shape of the supply curve based solely on the cost function. Let us suppose the market price for a one unit of our product is . For a company selling this good, the best strategy is to adjust the production so that its profit is maximized. We can maximize the profit
formula_250
by differentiating with respect to and solving
formula_251

 represents the optimal quantity of goods that the producer is willing to supply, which is indeed the supply itself:
formula_252

If we consider the maximal profit as a function of price, formula_253, we see that it is the Legendre transform of the cost function formula_254.

==Geometric interpretation==
For a strictly convex function, the Legendre transformation can be interpreted as a mapping between the graph of the function and the family of tangents of the graph. (For a function of one variable, the tangents are well-defined at all but at most countably many points, since a convex function is differentiable at all but at most countably many points.)

The equation of a line with slope formula_27 and formula_31-intercept formula_257 is given by formula_258. For this line to be tangent to the graph of a function formula_2 at the point formula_260 requires
formula_261
and
formula_262

Being the derivative of a strictly convex function, the function formula_45 is strictly monotone and thus injective. The second equation can be solved for formula_264 allowing elimination of formula_265 from the first, and solving for the formula_31-intercept formula_257 of the tangent as a function of its slope formula_268 formula_269 where formula_270 denotes the Legendre transform of formula_271

The family of tangent lines of the graph of formula_2 parameterized by the slope formula_27 is therefore given by
formula_274 or, written implicitly, by the solutions of the equation
formula_275

The graph of the original function can be reconstructed from this family of lines as the envelope of this family by demanding
formula_276

Eliminating formula_27 from these two equations gives
formula_278

Identifying formula_31 with formula_24 and recognizing the right side of the preceding equation as the Legendre transform of formula_281 yield formula_282

==Legendre transformation in more than one dimension==
For a differentiable real-valued function on an open convex subset of the Legendre conjugate of the pair is defined to be the pair , where is the image of under the gradient mapping , and is the function on given by the formula
formula_283
where
formula_284

is the scalar product on . The multidimensional transform can be interpreted as an encoding of the convex hull of the function&#x27;s epigraph in terms of its supporting hyperplanes. This can be seen as consequence of the following two observations. On the one hand, the hyperplane tangent to the epigraph of formula_2 at some point formula_286 has normal vector formula_287. On the other hand, any closed convex set formula_288 can be characterized via the set of its supporting hyperplanes by the equations formula_289, where formula_290 is the support function of formula_291. But the definition of Legendre transform via the maximization matches precisely that of the support function, that is, formula_292. We thus conclude that the Legendre transform characterizes the epigraph in the sense that the tangent plane to the epigraph at any point formula_293 is given explicitly byformula_294

Alternatively, if is a vector space and is its dual vector space, then for each point of and of , there is a natural identification of the cotangent spaces with and with . If is a real differentiable function over , then its exterior derivative, , is a section of the cotangent bundle and as such, we can construct a map from to . Similarly, if is a real differentiable function over , then defines a map from to . If both maps happen to be inverses of each other, we say we have a Legendre transform. The notion of the tautological one-form is commonly used in this setting.

When the function is not differentiable, the Legendre transform can still be extended, and is known as the Legendre-Fenchel transformation. In this more general setting, a few properties are lost: for example, the Legendre transform is no longer its own inverse (unless there are extra assumptions, like convexity).

==Legendre transformation on manifolds==

Let formula_295 be a smooth manifold, let formula_296 and formula_297 be a vector bundle on formula_298 and its associated bundle projection, respectively. Let formula_299 be a smooth function. We think of formula_300 as a Lagrangian by analogy with the classical case where formula_301, formula_302 and formula_303 for some positive number formula_304 and function formula_305.

As usual, the dual of formula_306 is denote by formula_307. The fiber of formula_308 over formula_309 is denoted formula_310, and the restriction of formula_300 to formula_310 is denoted by formula_313. The &quot;Legendre transformation&quot; of formula_300 is the smooth morphismformula_315 defined by formula_316, where formula_317. Here we use the fact that since formula_310 is a vector space, formula_319 can be identified with formula_310.
In other words, formula_321 is the covector that sends formula_322 to the directional derivative formula_323.

To describe the Legendre transformation locally, let formula_324 be a coordinate chart over which formula_306 is trivial. Picking a trivialization of formula_306 over formula_327, we obtain charts formula_328 and formula_329. In terms of these charts, we have formula_330, where formula_331 for all formula_332. If, as in the classical case, the restriction of formula_333 to each fiber formula_310 is strictly convex and bounded below by a positive definite quadratic form minus a constant, then the Legendre transform formula_335 is a diffeomorphism. Suppose that formula_336 is a diffeomorphism and let formula_337 be the &quot;Hamiltonian&quot; function defined by formula_338 where formula_339. Using the natural isomorphism formula_340, we may view the Legendre transformation of formula_341 as a map formula_342. Then we have formula_343

==Further properties==

===Scaling properties===
The Legendre transformation has the following scaling properties: For ,

formula_344
formula_345

It follows that if a function is homogeneous of degree then its image under the Legendre transformation is a homogeneous function of degree , where . (Since , with , implies .) Thus, the only monomial whose degree is invariant under Legendre transform is the quadratic.

A closed convex function is symmetric with respect to a given set of orthogonal linear transformations,

<doc id="390279" wikidata="Q1078110" url="?curid=390279" title="Chūō Main Line">
<text>The , commonly called the Chūō Line, is one of the major trunk railway lines in Japan. It connects Tokyo and Nagoya, although it is the slowest direct railway connection between the two cities; the coastal Tōkaidō Main Line is slightly faster, and the Tōkaidō Shinkansen is currently the fastest rail link between the cities.

The eastern portion, the , is operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East), while the western portion, the , is operated by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central). The dividing point between the two companies is , where express trains from both operators continue north onto the Shinonoi Line towards the cities of Matsumoto and Nagano. Compared to the huge urban areas at either end of the Chūō Line, its central portion is lightly traveled; the Shiojiri-Nakatsugawa corridor is only served by one limited express and one local service per hour.

The Chūō Main Line passes through the mountainous center of Honshu. Its highest point (near ) is about above sea level and much of the line has a gradient of 25 per mil (2.5% or 1 in 40). Along the Chūō East Line section, peaks of the Akaishi and Kiso as well as Mount Yatsugatake can be seen from trains. The Chūō West Line parallels the old Nakasendō highway (famous for the preserved post towns of Tsumago-juku and Magome-juku) and the steep Kiso Valley.

== Stations and services ==

This section lists all stations on the Chūō Main Line and generally explains regional services on the line. In addition, there are limited express services connecting major cities along the line, namely &quot;Azusa&quot;, &quot;Super Azusa&quot;, &quot;Kaiji&quot;, &quot;Hamakaiji&quot;, &quot;Narita Express&quot; and &quot;Shinano&quot;. For details of the limited express trains, see the relevant articles.

===Tokyo - Mitaka===
The section between Tokyo and Mitaka is grade-separated, with no level crossings. Between Ochanomizu and Mitaka, the Chūō Main Line has four tracks; two of them are with platforms at every station; the other two are with some stations without platforms. The local tracks are used by the Chūō-Sōbu Line local trains, while the rapid tracks carry rapid service and limited express trains. The Tokyo-Mitaka portion is a vital cross-city rail link.

The commuter services on the rapid tracks are collectively called the Chūō Line (Rapid) in comparison with the or the Chūō-Sōbu Line on the local tracks. The former is usually referred to simply as the Chūō Line and the latter the Sōbu Line. Separate groups of trainsets are used for these two groups of services: cars with an orange belt for the rapid service trains and cars with a yellow belt for the local service trains. Signs at stations also use these colors to indicate the services.

This section is located entirely within Tokyo.
===Mitaka - Takao===

The four-track section ends at Mitaka. Most of the section between Mitaka and Tachikawa had been elevated between 2008 and 2011 to eliminate level crossings. Plans have been proposed to add another two tracks as far as Tachikawa, but were not included in the track elevation.

===Takao - Shiojiri===
Most of the rapid service trains from Tokyo terminate at Takao, where the line exits the large urban area of Tokyo. The section between Takao and Ōtsuki still carries some commuter trains as well as long distance local trains and Limited Express trains. The &quot;Kaiji&quot; limited express terminates at Kōfu, the capital of Yamanashi Prefecture, while the &quot;Azusa&quot; continue beyond Shiojiri to Matsumoto via the Shinonoi Line.

All stations from Tachikawa to Shiojiri are served by the Chūō Main Line Local. Local trains from Tachikawa and Takao run as far as Matsumoto or even Nagano.

Legends:

* ●: All trains stop
* ▲: Stop, eastbound services only
* ▼: Stop, westbound services only

====Okaya – Shiojiri====

The Okaya-Shiojiri branch is an old route of the Chūō Main Line. It carries a small number of shuttle trains and trains from/to the Iida Line, which branches off at Tatsuno.

Prior to the opening of the new route between Okaya and Shiojiri, there was a junction () between and stations. It had a reversing layout. The signal station was closed on 12 October 1983.

===Shiojiri - Nakatsugawa ===

Shiojiri is the dividing point of the East Line and the West Line; no train continues from one to the other. The &quot;Shinano&quot; limited express is the main service for the rural Shiojiri-Nakatsugawa section.

===Nakatsugawa - Nagoya===
Local and rapid service trains run on the line from Nakatsugawa to Nagoya. This section carries urban traffic for the Greater Nagoya Area.

Local trains stop at all stations (except Sannō Junction).

Legends:
*● : All trains stop
*| ↓ ↑ : All trains pass (Arrows indicate the passing direction)
*▼ : Only southbound trains stop
*▲ : Only northbound trains stop

===Junctions===

* is a junction between Chino and Kami-Suwa stations in Suwa, Nagano. It entered into use on 2 September 1970.
* is a junction that diverts freight traffic from the Chūō Main Line to the Tōkaidō Line freight branch between Kanayama and Nagoya stations in Nagoya. It entered into use on 10 October 1962.

==Rolling stock ==

=== Chūō East Line (JR East) ===
New E233 series trains entered service on Tokyo-area commuter services from 26 December 2006. These trains are a development of the E231 series used on other commuter lines in the Tokyo area, and replaced the aging 201 series rolling stock introduced on the line in 1981.

From 2017, new E353 series EMUs were introduced on &quot;Azusa&quot; and &quot;Super Azusa&quot; limited express services, replacing the E351 and E257 series trains.

== History ==
The opened the initial section of the Chūō Line from Shinjuku Station to Tachikawa Station in 1889. The company then extended the line both westward and eastward (towards Tokyo) until it was nationalised in 1906. The Japanese Government Railways (JGR) then continued to extend the line, reaching Shiojiri the same year, and Tokyo (at ) in 1908. The JGR also built the line from Nagoya, the first section opening in 1900, with the lines connecting in 1911. The Table below gives the section opening dates.

In 1904, the section between Iidamachi Station (formerly located between Suidōbashi Station and Iidabashi Station) and Nakano Station was the first urban electric railway in Japan using 600 V DC. Electrification was extended in 1919 and 1922, was increased to 1,200 V DC when extended to Tokyo in 1927, boosted again to 1,500 V DC in 1929, and reached Kofu in 1931. Electrification from the Nagano end was commissioned in sections from 1966, and the entire line was electrified by 1973.
Notes:
* The section between Okaya Station and Shiojiri Station is the new route that replaced the old route opened on June 11, 1906, by JGR.
* Station names in parentheses are original names.
* Stations marked † are now closed.
* Prior to the connection of the East Line and the West Line in 1911, the section between Shiojiri Station and Miyanokoshi Station belonged to the East Line.

===Former connecting lines===

* Mitaka Station: A line to a Nakajima Aircraft factory opened in 1942, and was closed in 1945. In 1950, the factory site was used to build a sports stadium. The line from Mitaka to reopened on 14 April 1951, but was closed again on 1 November 1959.
* Kokubunji Station: A line was opened in 1910 to haul gravel from the Tamagawa. It closed in 1914 due to flood damage, but was reopened in 1916 after being rebuilt by the Japanese Army. On 26 May 1920, the line was absorbed into JNR, but operations were suspended from 1 December 1921. A extension to the Tokyo Racecourse opened on 1934. Services on the line were suspended from 1 October 1944, resuming from 24 April 1947. On 1 April 1973, the line to Tokyo Racecourse closed and the line was absorbed into the Musashino Line.
* Kofu Station: The Yamanashi Horse-drawn tramway opened its first gauge section in 1898, and by 1904 had opened two lines (to Katsunuma and Fujikawa) totaling . In 1930, the Katsunuma Line was closed, and the other line was closed beyond Kai-Aoyagi, from Kofu. The company renamed itself the Yamanashi Electric Railway, regauged (to 1,067 mm) and electrified the line at 600 V DC, and operated it until 1962.
* Sakashita Station: The gauge Sakagawa Line was opened to Maruno by the Hisaka River Railway in 1926. A passenger service was operated to Okuya. The Forest Service opened a line connecting at Maruno the same year, and a branch from Okuya that operated from 1933 until 1958. In 1944, the Forest Service took over the Sakagawa line, operating it until 1961, when the entire line closed.
* Nakatsugawa Station: The Kitaena Railway operated the Enaden Line to Tsukechi, electrified at 600 V DC, from 1924 until 1978. At Tsukechi, it transshipped timber from a gauge forest railway with an &quot;main line&quot; and a and two branch lines operated from 1932 until 1959.
* Ena Station: The Iwamura Electric Railway operated a line electrified at 600 V DC to its namesake town between 1906 and 1935. A line to the site of Oi dam was opened in 1922 to transport construction materials. Upon the dam&#x27;s completion, the line was sold to the Kita-Ena Railway. but it closed in 1934.
* Tokishi Station: The Ogawa Railway opened a line to its namesake town between 1922 and 1924. The line was electrified at 1,500 V DC in 1950, and closed as a result of flood damage in 1972.
* Yabuhara Station: The Ogiso Forest line operated for an unknown period.
* Agematsu Station: The Otaki Forest Railway operated between 1911 and 1975.
* Nojiri Station: The Nojiri Forest Railway operated for an unknown period.
* Tajima Station: The Kasahara Railway opened a line to its namesake town in 1928. Passenger services ceased in 1971, and the line closed in 1978.

===Proposed connecting lines===
* Chino Station: The Saku Railway, which had built the line from Komoro on the Shinetsu Line to Koumi, proposed to build a line from Tanaka on the Shinetsu Line to this station. The company was nationalised before construction started, and JGR connected the Koumi line to the Chuo Main Line in 1935, making this proposal redundant.

===Accidents===
On September 12, 1997, a &quot;Super Azusa&quot; limited express bound for Matsumoto collided with a 201 series local train that failed to stop at a red signal while passing through Ōtsuki Station.

<text>The Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists (ECAS) was founded by Albert Einstein and Leó Szilárd in May, 1946, primarily as a fundraising and policy-making agency. Its aims were to warn the public of the dangers associated with the development of nuclear weapons, promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and ultimately work towards world peace, which was seen as the only way that nuclear weapons would not be used again.

== History ==
The Committee was established in the wake of the &quot;Szilárd petition&quot; (July 1945) to United States president Harry S. Truman opposing the use of the atomic bomb on moral grounds, which was signed by 70 scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project. A majority of scientists working on the Manhattan Project did not know entirely what they were creating at the time.

Einstein called on seven other atomic scientists to join the effort, including Linus Pauling, R.F. Bacher, Hans A. Bethe, Edward U. Condon, Thorfin R. Hogness, Harold C. Urey, and V.F. Weisskopf. They were later joined by Selig Hecht, Harrison Brown, and H.J. Mueller.

=== Board of Trustees ===
The Committee only ever consisted of the eight members of the Board of Trustees, who were:
* Albert Einstein &quot;Chairman&quot;
* Harold C. Urey &quot;Vice-Chairman&quot;
* Hans Bethe
* Thorfin R. Hogness
* Philip M. Morse
* Linus Pauling
* Leó Szilárd
* Victor Weisskopf

Half the members had worked directly on the Manhattan Project and all had been indirectly involved or consulted on the production of the first atomic bomb.

=== Set of principles ===
&quot;These facts are accepted by all scientists:

# Atomic bombs can now be made cheaply and in large number. They will become more destructive.
# There is no military defense against atomic bombs and none is to be expected.
# Other nations can rediscover our secret processes by themselves.
# Preparedness against atomic war is futile, and if attempted, will ruin the structure of our social order.
# If war breaks out, atomic bombs will be used and they will surely destroy our civilization.
# There is no solution to this problem except international control of atomic energy, and ultimately, the elimination of war.

The program of the committee is to see that these truths become known to public.&quot;

=== Objective ===
== Activities ==
The Committee arranged private contributions to support atomic information and education. To facilitate this, ECAS was incorporated in New Jersey on August 6, 1946. ECAS directed the received contributions towards other groups such as National Committee for Atomic Information (NCAI), Association of Scientists for Atomic Education (ASAE), the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) and the Atomic Scientists of Chicago (ASC) of Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS). These groups aimed to educate both the general public and the U.S. government about the potential positive and negative aspects of atomic energy. They also conducted extensive educational initiatives.

Several members of the committee gave lecture tours to promote the committee&#x27;s message of peace. They produced supporting promotional materials, including one of the first films to illustrate what a full nuclear war might be like. Einstein and ECAS was also very vocal in its opposition of the development of the first hydrogen bomb.

=== Baruch Plan ===
Apart from fundraising, these programs aimed to garner backing for initiatives such as the Baruch Plan, which was presented to the United Nations in 1946 and proposed international control of the atomic bombs. The plan was passed by the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC), but not agreed to by the Soviet Union.

=== World Government ===
While committee initially saw success in fundraising efforts, Einstein and his colleagues grew increasingly convinced that the world was veering off course. They arrived at the conclusion that the gravity of the situation demanded more profound actions and the establishment of a &quot;world government&quot; was the only logical solution. In his &quot;Open Letter to the General Assembly of the United Nations&quot; of October 1947, Einstein emphasized the urgent need for international cooperation and the establishment of a world government. In the year 1948, Einstein invited United World Federalists, Inc.(UWF) president Cord Meyer to a meeting of ECAS and joined UWF as a member of the Advisory Board. Einstein and ECAS assisted UEF in fundraising and provided supporting material. Einstein described United World Federalists as: &quot;the group nearest to our aspirations&quot;. Einstein and other prominent figures sponsored the Peoples&#x27; World Convention (PWC), which took place in 1950-51. Their collaboration paid-off when Thane Read from UWF initiated a worldwide call for the World Constitutional Convention. Members of the ECAS signed the call which lead to the creation of a world constitution, for a democratic federal world government in world constituent assemblies of 1968, 1977, 1978-79, and 1991. These efforts were successful in creating the Constitution for the Federation of Earth and a Provisional World Government consisting of a Provisional World Parliament.

== Committee dissolution and legacy ==
At the end of 1948, with the gradual deterioration of international relations, failure of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) in 1947 and escalating international tensions after 1947, committee recognized that:

On the question of disposition of the funds, Einstein wrote Harrison Brown on June 12, 1951:

The proposal put forth by Einstein and Szilard did not ultimately gain acceptance. Instead, the committee&#x27;s assets were transferred to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Final dissolution of ECAS was done on September 8, 1951 in a meeting at Einstein&#x27;s Home and officially dissolved on October 10, 1951.

ECAS was active for four years, until 1950 when it was gradually disbanded, although most of the members continued to campaign against nuclear war, and participated in the development of the Constitution for the Federation of Earth and the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs.

<doc id="390296" wikidata="Q826224" url="?curid=390296" title="Tubular Bells">
<text>Tubular Bells is the debut studio album by the British musician Mike Oldfield, released on 25 May 1973 as the first album on Virgin Records. It comprises two mostly instrumental tracks. Oldfield, who was 19 years old when it was recorded, played almost all the instruments.

&quot;Tubular Bells&quot; initially sold slowly, but gained worldwide attention in December 1973 when its opening theme was used for the soundtrack to the horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. This led to a surge in sales which increased Oldfield&#x27;s profile and played an important part in the growth of the Virgin Group. It stayed in the top ten of the UK Albums Chart for one year from March 1974, during which it reached number one for one week. It reached number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number one in Canada and Australia. It has sold more than 2.7 million copies in the UK, and an estimated 15 million copies worldwide.

An orchestral version produced by David Bedford was released in 1975 as &quot;The Orchestral Tubular Bells&quot;. It was followed by the albums &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot; (1992), &quot;Tubular Bells III&quot; (1998), &quot;The Millennium Bell&quot; (1999), and a re-recorded version, &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot;, for its 30th anniversary. A remastered edition was released in 2009. In 2010, &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; was one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail. Its contribution to British music was recognised when Oldfield played extracts during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London.

== Background ==
Oldfield learned to play the guitar at an early age, and as a teenager he became the bass player for the Whole World, a band put together by Kevin Ayers, formerly of Soft Machine. The Whole World recorded their album &quot;Shooting at the Moon&quot; (1970) at Abbey Road Studios over several months in 1970, when Oldfield was 17. When the group did not have a recording session booked in the morning, Oldfield would arrive early and experiment with the different instruments, including pianos, harpischords, a Mellotron and various orchestral percussion instruments, and learned to play each of them.

The Whole World broke up in mid-1971 and Ayers lent Oldfield a two-track Bang &amp; Olufsen Beocord ¼&quot; tape recorder. Oldfield blocked off the erase head of the tape machine, which allowed him to record onto one track, bounce the recording onto the second, and record a new instrument onto the first track, thus overdubbing his playing one instrument at a time, and effectively making multitrack recordings. 

In his flat in Tottenham in north London, Oldfield recorded demos of four tracks he had been composing in his head for some years, using the tape recorder, his guitar and bass, some toy percussion instruments, and a Farfisa organ borrowed from the Whole World keyboardist David Bedford. The demos comprised three shorter melodies (early versions of what would become the sections &quot;Peace&quot;, &quot;Bagpipe Guitars&quot;, and &quot;Caveman&quot; on &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot;), and a longer piece he had provisionally titled &quot;Opus One&quot;. Oldfield was inspired to write a long instrumental after hearing &quot;Septober Energy&quot; (1971), the only album by Centipede. He was also influenced by classical music, and by &quot;A Rainbow in Curved Air&quot; (1969) by the experimental composer Terry Riley, on which Riley played all the instruments himself and used tape loops and overdubs to build up a long, repetitive piece of music.
Late in 1971, Oldfield joined the band of Arthur Louis, who were recording demos at the Manor Studio. The studio was being constructed in the former squash court of an old manor house in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, which had recently been bought by the young entrepreneur Richard Branson and which was being turned into a residential recording facility run by his music production team of Tom Newman and Simon Heyworth. Oldfield was shy and socially awkward, but struck up a friendship with the producers after they heard his guitar playing. Oldfield asked Newman to listen to his demos, but they were in his Tottenham flat, so one of Louis&#x27; roadies drove Oldfield to London and back to retrieve them. Newman and Heyworth made a copy of the demos onto 4-track tape, and promised Oldfield that they would speak to Branson and his business partner Simon Draper about them. After the album was released, Newman said he preferred the demo versions: &quot;They were complete melodies in themselves – with intros and fade-outs or ends. I liked them very much and was a little nonplussed when Mike strung them all together.&quot;

Oldfield spent much of 1972 working with his old bandmates from the Whole World on their solo projects while trying to find a record label interested in his demos. Oldfield approached labels including EMI and CBS, but each rejected him, believing the piece was unmarketable without vocals. Increasingly frustrated and short of money, Oldfield heard that the Soviet Union paid musicians to give public performances, and was at the point of looking through the telephone directory for the phone number of the Soviet embassy when Draper called him with an invitation to dinner with Branson on Branson&#x27;s houseboat moored in London. Branson told Oldfield that he liked the demos, and wanted Oldfield to spend a week at the Manor recording &quot;Opus One&quot;.

== Recording ==
&quot;Tubular Bells&quot; was recorded on an Ampex 2-inch 16-track tape recorder with the Dolby noise-reduction system, which was the Manor&#x27;s main recording equipment at the time. Oldfield had Virgin hire instruments including guitars, keyboards and percussion instruments. Oldfield has recounted differing stories over the years regarding the inclusion of the tubular bells; in 2001 he suggested that they were among the instruments he asked Branson to hire, but in 2013, he said that he saw them among the instruments being removed from the studios after John Cale had finished recording there, and asked for them to be left behind. 

Oldfield, Newman, and Heyworth spent their evenings drinking in a pub, after which they returned to the Manor and recorded through the night. Heyworth recalled several disasters, including one instance where half a day&#x27;s work was accidentally erased. Final mixing was an involved process, with the faders operated by Oldfield, Newman, Heyworth, and two others simultaneously. They followed detailed tracking charts and the process was restarted if one person made even a slight mistake. Heyworth recalled difficulty in cutting the album due to vinyl&#x27;s limited dynamic range, and insisted on heavy vinyl normally used for classical records.

Oldfield played the majority of the instruments as a series of overdubs, which was an uncommon recording technique at the time. In total, 274 overdubs were made and an estimated two thousand &quot;punch-ins&quot;, although Newman said &quot;it was really only 70 or 80&quot; in total. Despite various guitars being listed on the album sleeve, such as &quot;speed guitars&quot;, &quot;fuzz guitars&quot; and &quot;guitars sounding like bagpipes&quot;, the only electric guitar used on the album was a 1966 blonde Fender Telecaster which used to belong to Marc Bolan and to which Oldfield had added an extra Bill Lawrence pickup. The guitars were recorded via direct injection into the mixing desk. To create the &quot;speed guitar&quot; and &quot;mandolin-like guitar&quot; named in the sleeve notes, the tape was recorded at half speed. An actual mandolin was used only for the ending of Part Two. Oldfield also used a custom effects unit, the Glorfindel box, to create the &quot;fuzz guitars&quot; and &quot;bagpipe guitars&quot; distortion. In 2011, Oldfield&#x27;s Telecaster was sold for £6,500, and the money was donated to the mental health charity SANE. According to the engineer Phil Newell, the bass guitar used on the album was one of his Fender Telecaster Basses.

=== Side one ===
Oldfield recorded side one, known as &quot;Opus One&quot; at the time, during his one allotted week at the Manor in November 1972. He was particularly interested in starting the piece with a repeating riff, and devised the opening piano sequence after experimenting with an idea for several minutes on Bedford&#x27;s Farfisa organ. He wanted a slight variation on its 16/8 time signature by dropping the sixteenth beat, and chose the key of A minor as it was easy to play. Oldfield recorded the opening riff on a Steinway grand piano, but struggled to perform in time. Heyworth solved the problem by placing a microphone next to a metronome in another room and feeding it into Oldfield&#x27;s headphones. The short honky-tonk piano section was included as a tribute to Oldfield&#x27;s grandmother, who had played the instrument in pubs before World War II. The staff and workers at the Manor made up the &quot;nasal choir&quot; that accompanies it. Oldfield had difficulty in producing a sound from the tubular bells, as he wanted a loud note from them but both the standard leather-covered and bare metal hammers did not produce the volume that he wanted. In the end, Newman obtained a heavier claw hammer and Oldfield used it to produce the desired sound intensity but cracked the bells in the process.

The track closes with a segment featuring Vivian Stanshall, formerly of the comedic rock group Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, introducing each instrument being played one by one. The idea originated when the band were due to use the Manor after Oldfield, and had arrived while he was still recording. Oldfield had liked the way Stanshall introduced the instruments one at a time on the Bonzos&#x27; song &quot;The Intro and the Outro&quot; on &quot;Gorilla&quot; (1967), and told Newman that he would like Stanshall to do the same. Newman agreed, but had to persuade the shy Oldfield to ask Stanshall if he would carry out the request. Stanshall readily agreed to the idea and is credited on the liner notes as &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot;, but Newman recalled that the job proved to be more difficult than anticipated, as Stanshall forgot the names of the instruments and introduced them at the wrong points. Oldfield wrote a list of the instruments in order, indicating where Stanshall should introduce them. The way in which Stanshall said &quot;plus... tubular bells&quot; inspired Oldfield to use it as the album&#x27;s title.

=== Side two ===
After Part One had been recorded, Oldfield was allowed to stay on at the Manor to record additional overdubs during studio downtime. He spent Christmas and New Year at his family&#x27;s home, but returned to the Manor from February to April 1973 to record the second part of his planned album. Oldfield had &quot;Part Two&quot; mapped out and sequenced by the time he came to record it.

The &quot;caveman&quot; section is the only part of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; that features a drum kit, which is played by Steve Broughton of the Edgar Broughton Band. The section begins with a backing track of bass and drums, with Oldfield overdubbing all other instruments. The shouting vocals developed near the end of the recording, when he had practically finished recording the instruments for the section but felt it needed something else. Heyworth recalled that Branson was getting impatient and pressured Oldfield to deliver the album, and to include vocals on one of the tracks so he could release it as a single. Angered by Branson&#x27;s suggestion, Oldfield returned to the Manor where he drank half a bottle of Jameson&#x27;s whiskey from the studio&#x27;s cellar and demanded that the engineer take him to the studio where, intoxicated, he &quot;screamed his brains out for 10 minutes&quot; into a microphone. The incident left Oldfield so hoarse that he was unable to speak for two weeks. The engineer ran the tape at a higher speed during the recording, so that upon playback the tape ran at normal speed, thus dropping the pitch of the voice track and producing the &quot;Piltdown Man&quot; vocals listed on the credits.

Side two closes with a rendition of &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;, a track Oldfield had been performing since he was in the Whole World. It was originally preceded by a longer version of the piece, featuring a vocal contribution from Stanshall over musical backing and marching footsteps. This session occurred at 4 a.m. after Oldfield, Stanshall, and Newman had spent the night drinking. Newman placed microphones in various rooms of the Manor and began recording, and the trio set off on an unplanned tour of the house, with Oldfield on mandolin and Newman on acoustic guitar playing &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot; while Stanshall gave an inebriated, improvised tour of the Manor. In the end, a more traditional instrumental version of the tune was put on the album although Stanshall&#x27;s version was included on the &quot;Boxed&quot; compilation. It is also found on the 2001 and 2009 remasters as a bonus track.

== Artwork ==
The cover of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; was created by designer and photographer Trevor Key, who was suggested by Sue Steward, a press officer at Virgin Records at the time. Key was invited to present his portfolio, and one of his designs depicted a boiled egg with blood dripping from it, which Branson liked and wanted to use for the cover because he wanted to call the album &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot;. Oldfield hated both the image and the title and rejected them. A modified version of the image, with the blood replaced by egg yolk, was used as the cover for &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Open&quot; (1991), Oldfield&#x27;s final album for Virgin.

Steward accompanied Key to a beach on the Sussex coast to photograph the cover&#x27;s backdrop. Key brought with him bones shown burning on the beach on the back cover, but the day was bitterly cold and it took some time to set light to them. The perfectionist Key also spent several hours photographing the seascape until he had a shot of the waves that he was happy with. The triangular &quot;bent bell&quot; on the front was inspired by the damage Oldfield had caused to the tubular bells while playing them on the record. Key designed and constructed one, which he then photographed in his studio and superimposed on the beach backdrop. Oldfield was captivated by the finished artwork, and insisted that his name and the album title be in small letters and coloured pale orange, so as not to distract from the overall image. According to Steward, Key was paid £100 for his work, but he went on to design several other sleeves for Virgin and Factory Records artists, including &quot;Technique&quot; (1989) by New Order and &quot;Genetic Engineering&quot; (1983) by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.

The &quot;bent bell&quot; has become the image most associated with Oldfield, appearing on the cover of every &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; sequel album. It is also the logo of his personal music company, Oldfield Music Ltd. The cover of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; was among ten images chosen by Royal Mail for a set of &quot;Classic Album Cover&quot; postage stamps, issued in January 2010.

== Release ==
In January 1973, Branson visited the MIDEM music conference in Cannes, France and pitched side one to various music companies with the hope of securing a record deal. One American executive offered $20,000 if vocals were added to the music. The unsuccessful visit led Branson and Draper to consider putting the album out through mail order, before they chose to form their own label, Virgin Records, and use &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; as their first release. The album was released in the UK on 25 May 1973, and in North America in October 1973.
Early sales were slow, and it was not until July 1973 that the album appeared in the UK Albums Chart, reaching an initial peak of number seven. The situation changed following the release of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; in December 1973, Oldfield later attributing the music&#x27;s successful use on the soundtrack to its unusual 15/8 opening time signature. From February 1974 to May 1975, &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; dropped out of the UK top 10 for only four weeks. Sixteen months after its release, it went to number one for the week ending 5October 1974, having spent 10 consecutive weeks in second place behind &quot;Band on the Run&quot; (1973) by Wings, and Oldfield&#x27;s second album &quot;Hergest Ridge&quot; (1974).

In surpassing &quot;Hergest Ridge&quot; for the number one album, Oldfield became only the second artist in history to replace himself at the top of the UK album chart, after the Beatles in 1963, and again in 1964. The feat was later achieved by Michael Jackson and David Bowie, although on both occasions this followed the death of the artist. Prior to the 2020s, the album had re-entered the charts in every decade since its release, most recently appearing in the week ending 22 March 2018 (its 287th week in total).

On 22 April 2007, British newspaper &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; gave away 2.25 million free copies of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; to its readers in a card packet displaying the artwork. The release was organised by EMI, who had bought out Virgin Records, and the newspaper claimed that its promotion increased sales of the album by 30%. Oldfield was unhappy about the deal, as he had not been consulted about it and felt it devalued the work.

&quot;Tubular Bells&quot; has sold more than 2.63 million copies in the UK, and an estimated 15 million worldwide. As of July 2016, it was the 42nd best-selling album of all time in the UK.

=== Singles ===
The first single released from the album was created by the original US distributor, Atlantic Records. The single was an edit of the first three sections from Part One and was not authorised by Oldfield. The single was released in February 1974 in the United States and Canada only, where it peaked at number seven on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on 11 May 1974. The track also reached number 15 on the Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, the single was released as &quot;Tubular Bells (Theme from &quot;Exorcist&quot;)&quot;, peaking at number three on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart on 18 May 1974, and was placed at number 103 in the top 200 singles of the year.

&quot;Mike Oldfield&#x27;s Single (Theme from &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;)&quot; was the first 7-inch single released by Oldfield in the UK, in June 1974, peaking at number 31. The A-side was a re-recording of Part Two&#x27;s &quot;bagpipe guitars&quot; section, arranged in a more pastoral version with acoustic guitars and featuring the oboe (played by Lindsay Cooper) as the lead instrument, with &quot;Froggy Went A-Courting&quot; as the B-side.

==Reissues==
=== 2009 reissue ===
In 2008, Oldfield&#x27;s original 35-year deal with Virgin Records ended and the rights to the album returned to him. After signing to Mercury Records in 2005, Oldfield&#x27;s albums originally released on Virgin were transferred to Mercury and re-released, starting the following year. &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; was reissued in June 2009 in a number of formats, including vinyl, 2-CD and DVD, and includes a new stereo mix by Oldfield in March 2009 from his home studio in Nassau, Bahamas. The Deluxe Edition contains a 5.1 surround sound mix and the Ultimate Edition contains an accompanying book and memorabilia.

The release was promoted by a series of bell-ringing events at 6 p.m. on 6 June 2009, a reference to the Number of the Beast. One of the events was held at the British Music Experience at The O2, featuring the 29-piece Handbell Ringers of Great Britain and a performance by The Orb named &quot;Orbular Bells&quot;. There were also bell-ringing workshops and competitions at the Experience. The album reached number 11 in the UK.

=== 2023 reissue ===
A 50th anniversary edition of the album was released on 26 May 2023 on CD and half-speed mastered 2LP. It features a new master of the original album along with additional previously released tracks including the 2012 Olympics recording, the &quot;Tubular Beats&quot; recording with York, &quot;Tubular X&quot; (from &quot;The X-Files&quot;), and one new 8-minute track, the &quot;Introduction to &quot;Tubular Bells 4&quot;&quot; which was recorded by Oldfield as a demo in 2017. Oldfield&#x27;s record label has indicated that after recording the 8-minute demo he decided not to go forward with the &quot;Tubular Bells 4&quot; project, and that this &quot;may well be the last piece ever to be recorded by Oldfield&quot;. A Blu-ray audio version was also being produced which includes new Dolby Atmos and stereo mixes by David Kosten as well as Oldfield&#x27;s 2009 5.1 mix and the 1975 quadrophonic mix by Phil Newell.

== Live performances ==
=== Queen Elizabeth Hall, 1973 ===

After recording &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, Oldfield felt he had &quot;got it out of his system&quot; and was reluctant to do any promotional engagements. However, Branson and Draper felt a live performance of the work was the best way to present it to journalists and the public, and organised a concert at London&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall on 25 June 1973. Oldfield was convinced that the music would not come off well in a live setting, and despite several well-known and accomplished musicians agreeing to the one-off show, refused to do it. Desperate to prevent Oldfield pulling out, Branson offered to give Oldfield his Bentley car, which he had bought from George Harrison and knew Oldfield liked, if he went through with the gig. Oldfield agreed, and following rehearsals at Shepperton film studios, Oldfield still had reservations about the performance until Mick Taylor of The Rolling Stones brought frontman Mick Jagger backstage to meet Oldfield, whose support gave Oldfield the confidence to &quot;at least walk on stage.&quot; The concert went ahead and was well received, leaving Oldfield &quot;stunned&quot;.

The concert featured members of Henry Cow and musicians associated with the Canterbury scene, as well as Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones. Steve Winwood and Robert Wyatt were also due to take part, but Winwood pulled out as he was unable to find time to attend the rehearsals, and Wyatt was recovering from the recent accident that had left him paralysed.

=== BBC TV &quot;2nd House&quot;, 1973 ===
Oldfield and many of the musicians who had taken part in the Queen Elizabeth Hall concert performed Part One again later in the year for the BBC arts programme &quot;2nd House&quot;, this time as a pre-recorded performance in a studio setting without an audience. The performance was recorded on 30 November 1973 and transmitted on BBC2 on 5 January 1974. The arrangement included a new part for oboe, played by Soft Machine&#x27;s Karl Jenkins, and accompanied on-screen visuals of tubular steel sculptures and sequences from the film &quot;Reflections&quot;, both created by artist William Pye. The performance was released on the &quot;Elements&quot; (2004) DVD and as part of the Deluxe and Ultimate Editions of the 2009 reissue of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;.

== Reception ==
Influential British DJ John Peel was an early admirer of the record, and played it on his &quot;Top Gear&quot; radio show on BBC Radio 1 on 29 May 1973, four days after the album&#x27;s release, calling it &quot;one of the most impressive LPs I&#x27;ve ever had the chance to play on the radio, really a remarkable record&quot;. Branson and Oldfield were listening to the show on Branson&#x27;s houseboat, and Oldfield stated in his autobiography that Peel played the album in its entirety, although the running order from the BBC archives and existing audio copies of the programme show that Peel played Part One only.

Peel reviewed the album for &quot;The Listener&quot; magazine the following week, describing it as &quot;a new recording of such strength and beauty that to me it represents the first break-through into history that any musician has made&quot;. The UK&#x27;s major music magazines were also unanimous in their praise of the album. Al Clark of &quot;NME&quot; said that the &quot;veritable orgy of over-dubbing results in a remarkable piece of sustained music, never content with the purely facile yet equally disinclined towards confusing the listener&quot;. He concluded that &quot;&quot;Tubular Bells&quot; ... is a superlative record which owes nothing to contemporary whims. It is one of the most mature, vital, rich and humerous [&quot;sic&quot;] pieces of music to have emerged from the pop idiom.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Geoff Brown observed that &quot;&quot;Tubular Bells&quot; is a vast work, almost classical in its structure and in the way a theme is stated and deftly worked upon&quot; and that it was &quot;an enjoyable, evocative album which bodes well for the future of both the country&#x27;s newest label and of Mike Oldfield&quot;.

Reviewing the whole batch of Virgin&#x27;s first album releases in &quot;Sounds&quot;, Steve Peacock named &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; the best, saying that after careful listening he &quot;ended up convinced that it really is a remarkable album&quot;, noting the &quot;complex, interlocking carefully woven music that works its way through an enormous dynamic and emotional range&quot;, and stating, &quot;I can&#x27;t think of another album that I&#x27;d as unhesitatingly recommend to everyone who&#x27;s likely to read this&quot;. A more reserved review came from Simon Frith in &quot;Let It Rock&quot; who felt that &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; was &quot;more than an attractive wall-paper, more than a nature-film score, because of Mike Oldfield&#x27;s ability to make what happens to the music self-sufficient and satisfying&quot;, but questioned why Peel and other critics viewed the album as rock music, and concluded that &quot;Oldfield&#x27;s concern is the sound of rock, but &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; lacks rock&#x27;s other essence — energy. This is no way body music — no sex, no violence, no ecstasy; nothing uncontrolled, nothing uncontrollable.&quot;

Paul Gambaccini wrote an enthusiastic review of the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, calling it &quot;the most important one-shot project of 1973&quot; and &quot;a debut performance of a kind we have no right to expect from anyone. It took Mike Oldfield half a year to lay down the thousands of overdubs required for his 49 minutes of exhilarating music. I will be playing the result for many times that long.&quot; He concluded, &quot;I can say that this is a major work&quot;. On the other hand, in an article in the same magazine seven months later which discussed the current top twenty albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, Jon Landau dismissed the record as &quot;a clever novelty&quot; and said, &quot;Light, rather showy and cute in places, it probably makes pleasant background music for a dinner or conversation&quot;. Writing for &quot;Creem&quot;, Robert Christgau was also left unmoved, saying, &quot;The best I can come up with here is &#x27;pleasant&#x27; and &#x27;catchy&#x27;. Oldfield isn&#x27;t Richard Strauss or even Leonard Cohen — this is a soundtrack because that&#x27;s the level at which he operates.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic Mike DeGagne called the album &quot;arguably the finest conglomeration of off-centered instruments concerted together to form a single, unique piece&quot; and stated that &quot;the most interesting and overwhelming aspect of this album is the fact that so many sounds are conjured up, yet none go unnoticed, allowing the listener a gradual submergence into each unique portion of the music. &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; is a divine excursion into the realm of new-age music.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
Oldfield won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018.

In &quot;Q&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1998 list of &quot;The 50 Best Albums of the &#x27;70s&quot;, &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; was placed at number six. In the &quot;Q&quot; &amp; &quot;Mojo&quot; Classic special issue &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot; in 2005, the album was listed at number nine in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

== Legacy ==
=== &quot;The Exorcist&quot; ===
The introduction to Part One was chosen to feature in the 1973 horror film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. According to the British film critic Mark Kermode, the decision to include the music was the result of chance – the director, William Friedkin, had decided to discard the original score by Lalo Schifrin and was looking for music to replace it. Friedkin was visiting the offices of Ahmet Ertegun, the president of Atlantic Records (which distributed &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; in the US), and picking up a white label record of the album from the selection of records in Ertegun&#x27;s office, he put it on the record player and instantly decided that the music would be perfect for the film. Although the introduction only features briefly in two scenes, it has become the track most commonly associated with the film. Oldfield said he did not want to see the film because he believed he would find it too frightening.

=== Sequels and other albums ===
&quot;Tubular Bells&quot; remains the album most identified with Oldfield, and he has released three sequels. &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot; was released in 1992 which, like its predecessor, reached number one in the UK. It was followed by the electronic and dance-oriented &quot;Tubular Bells III&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Millennium Bell&quot; (1999). On the thirtieth anniversary of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, Oldfield re-recorded the original &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; with contemporary technology, making several corrections to what he saw as flaws in the album&#x27;s original production. Since Stanshall died in 1995, the re-recording features new narration provided by actor John Cleese. &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot; went to number 51 in the UK.

In 1975, an orchestral arrangement of the original album was released as &quot;The Orchestral Tubular Bells&quot;.

Compilations:
* &quot;The Best of Tubular Bells&quot; (2001)
* &quot;The Complete Tubular Bells&quot; (2003)

Oldfield and York&#x27;s 2013 remix album &quot;Tubular Beats&quot; contains two remixes of sections of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;.

=== Virgin Group ===

Richard Branson recognised the significance of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; to the Virgin Group&#x27;s success, who named one of his first Virgin America aircraft, an Airbus A319-112, N527VA &quot;Tubular Belle&quot;. Prior to this Virgin Atlantic had named a Boeing 747-4Q8, G-VHOT &quot;Tubular Belle&quot;, in 1994.

In the United Kingdom Virgin Money signalled its entry into the banking sector in January 2012 with a television advertisement titled &#x27;40 Years of Better&#x27;. The advertisement opened with an image of a record orbiting the Earth accompanied by the music of the introduction to &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, signifying the beginnings of Virgin, and ended with a shot of the same record framed and hanging on the wall of the new bank. Two months later a Virgin Media TV advertisement starring Branson and actor David Tennant also featured the record, where a younger version of Branson is seen holding a copy of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; under his arm upon exiting a time machine. However, the advert was withdrawn shortly afterwards following objections from the BBC that it was being used to endorse a rival TV service (in the advert Tennant is shown searching on Virgin&#x27;s TiVo on-demand service for episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a BBC series in which he formerly played the titular character).

In May 2021, Virgin Orbit, the commercial rocket launch provider subsidiary of the Virgin Group, announced the first operational mission of their LauncherOne air-launched rocket would be named after the first track of the album, Tubular Bells, Part One.

=== Cultural references ===
The use of the opening theme in the 1973 film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; gained the record considerable publicity and introduced the work to a broader audience. Along with a number of other Oldfield pieces the theme was used in the 1979 NASA movie &quot;The Space Movie&quot;. It has gained cultural significance as a &quot;haunting theme&quot;, partly due to the association with &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, and has been sampled by many other artists.

In television it was used in several episodes of the Dutch children&#x27;s series &quot;Bassie en Adriaan&quot;, and an episode (&quot;Ghosts&quot;) of the BBC series &quot;My Family&quot;. It was used in a television advertisement for the Volkswagen Golf Diesel in 2002 and in various films.

=== Computer tie-ins ===
With the aid of the software house CRL and distributor Nu Wave, Mike Oldfield released an interactive Commodore 64 version of the album in 1986, which used the computer&#x27;s SID sound chip to play back a simplified re-arrangement of the album, accompanied by some simple 2D visual effects. The &quot;interactivity&quot; offered by the album/program was limited to controlling the speed and quantity of the visual effects, tuning the sound&#x27;s volume and filtering, and skipping to any part of the album.

In 2004, Oldfield launched a virtual reality project called &quot;Maestro&quot; which contains music from &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot;. The original title of the game was &quot;The Tube World&quot;. This was the second game which was released under the MusicVR banner, the first being &quot;Tres Lunas&quot;. MusicVR set out to be a real-time virtual reality experience combining imagery and music, as a non-violent and essentially a non-goal driven game.

In 2012 Universal and Indaba Music created a &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; remix contest, where users could download original stem recordings to create their own pieces and the winner of the $1,000 prize was judged by Oldfield.

=== 2012 Olympic Games ===
On 27 July 2012 at the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony Mike Oldfield performed during a segment about the NHS and children’s literature. 600 dancers, all of whom were NHS staff, along with 1,200 volunteers recruited from British hospitals, along with people from the Great Ormond Street Hospital, entered along with children on 320 hospital beds, some of which functioned as trampolines. The show&#x27;s director Danny Boyle stated that he had wanted to make &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; a &quot;cornerstone&quot; of a 20-minute sequence of the ceremony. A studio version of Oldfield&#x27;s performance appears on the soundtrack album &quot;Isles of Wonder&quot;. Although listed as &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;/&quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot;, the track consists of a number of parts, the first being the introduction piece to his &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; in its normal arrangement, then this is followed by a rearranged version of that same theme that during interviews Oldfield has called &quot;swingular bells&quot;. The piece that is used when children&#x27;s literature villains appear features two arrangements of &quot;Far Above the Clouds&quot; (from &quot;Tubular Bells III&quot;), and finally as the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; characters appear to drive off the villains, there is a rendition of &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot; followed by a short coda.

The Olympics version was released as a 500-copy limited edition pink/blue vinyl single on 8 October 2012. This was also released on iTunes as &quot;Tubular Bells/In Dulci Julio (Music from the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games)&quot; as well as on the official 2012 Olympics album. In 2023, this rendition appeared on the 50th anniversary release of &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;.

This lists the movements as:
# &quot;Tubular Bells (Part One Excerpt)&quot;
# &quot;Tubular Bells (Part One Swing)&quot;
# &quot;Tubular Bells (Part Two Excerpt)&quot;
# &quot;Tubular Bells III (Far Above the Clouds)&quot;
# &quot;Mary Poppins Arrival&quot;
# &quot;Fanfare for the Isles of Wonder&quot;
# &quot;In Dulci Jubilo&quot;
# &quot;Olympic Tubular Bells Coda&quot;

== Adaptations ==
American artist Tori Amos has frequently used the opening &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; theme in her live shows. It began during the 1996 Dew Drop Inn Tour where she let &quot;Father Lucifer&quot; segue into &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; on the piano while singing words from Bronski Beat&#x27;s &quot;Smalltown Boy&quot; as well as playing it on the harpsichord during songs &quot;Love Song&quot; (a Cure cover) and &quot;Bells for Her&quot; (from the album &quot;Under the Pink&quot;), usually while mixing in lyrics from a third song such as Björk&#x27;s &quot;Hyperballad&quot; or &quot;Blue Skies&quot;. It appeared again in 2005 as part of &quot;Yes, Anastasia&quot;, and on the 2007 tour promoting her album &quot;American Doll Posse&quot; where it was performed with full band as an intro to &quot;Devils and Gods&quot;. On the 2011 tour, promoting her album &quot;Night of Hunters&quot; it is being performed as the intro to and backing melody for &quot;God.&quot;

&quot;Tubular Bells for Two&quot; is a music-theatre production created by two Australian multi-instrumentalists, Aidan Roberts and Daniel Holdsworth, in 2009. The two musicians perform over twenty instruments to recreate the original album &#x27;as faithfully as physically possible&#x27;. The show won a Sydney Fringe Award for &quot;Best Musical Moment&quot; in the 2010 Festival, and has been performed at festivals around Australia and the Pacific. The show made its European debut at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2012, where it won two awards.

In 2013, Oldfield invited Branson to the opening of St. Andrew&#x27;s International School of The Bahamas, where two of Oldfield&#x27;s children were pupils. This was the occasion of the debut of &quot;Tubular Bells for Schools&quot;, a piano solo adaptation of Oldfield&#x27;s work.

The music from the 1973 film was used in a 1982 Hungarian traffic safety film. (Caution! Railroad crossing!) from 9:20.

<doc id="390307" wikidata="Q509266" url="?curid=390307" title="USS America (CV-66)">
<text>USS &quot;America&quot; (CVA/CV-66) was one of three supercarriers built for the United States Navy in the 1960s. Commissioned in 1965, she spent most of her career in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, but did make three Pacific deployments serving in the Vietnam War. She also served in the Persian Gulf War&#x27;s operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

&quot;America&quot; was the first large aircraft carrier since Operation Crossroads in 1946 to be expended in weapons tests. In 2005, she was scuttled southeast of Cape Hatteras, after four weeks of tests, despite a large protest of former crew members who wanted to see her instituted as a memorial museum. She was the largest warship ever sunk.

==Construction and shakedown==

Originally ordered as an &quot;Enterprise&quot;-class nuclear carrier, the ballooning costs of during construction caused the cancellation of the nuclear CVAN-66 and her reordering as a conventionally powered &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;-class carrier. She was laid down on 1 January 1961 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Corp.; launched on 1 February 1964, sponsored by Mrs. Catherine McDonald, wife of Admiral David L. McDonald, the Chief of Naval Operations; and commissioned at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 23 January 1965, Captain Lawrence Heyworth Jr., in command.

After fitting out there until 15 March 1965, &quot;America&quot; remained in Hampton Roads for operations off the Virginia Capes until getting underway on 25 March. She conducted her first catapult launch on 5 April 1965, with Commander Kenneth B. Austin, the carrier&#x27;s executive officer, piloting a Douglas A-4C Skyhawk. Proceeding thence to the Caribbean, the carrier conducted shakedown training and concluded it at Guantánamo Bay on 23 June.

Entering the Norfolk shipyard for post-shakedown availability on 10 July, she remained there until 21 August. She next operated locally through late August and then proceeded to the operating areas off the Virginia Capes and to Bermuda, arriving back at Norfolk on 9 September. On 25 September, Rear Admiral J. O. Cobb broke his flag as Commander, Carrier Division 2 (CarDiv 2).

==First deployment (1965–1966)==
&quot;America&quot; sailed for her first Mediterranean deployment late in 1965. New Year&#x27;s Day, 1966, found her at Livorno, Italy. Over the ensuing weeks, the ship visited Cannes, Genoa, Toulon, Athens, Istanbul, Beirut, Valletta, Taranto, Palma, and Pollensa Bay in Spain. She sailed on 1 July for the United States. Early in the deployment, from 28 February – 10 March, &quot;America&quot; participated in a joint Franco-American exercise &quot;Fairgame IV&quot;, which simulated conventional warfare against a country attempting to invade a NATO ally. She arrived at Naval Station Norfolk on 10 July, remaining there for only a short time before shifting to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 15 July for availability.

&quot;America&quot; operated locally in the Norfolk area from 29 August – 19 September, after which time she proceeded to Guantánamo Bay to carry out training. After Hurricane Inez swirled through the region, her sailors spent an estimated 1,700-man-hours in helping the naval base at Guantanamo to recover and return to normal operations.

The following month, &quot;America&quot; initiated into carrier service the A-7 Corsair II, conducting its flight qualifications off the Virginia Capes, while she also conducted automatic carrier landing system trials which demonstrated the feasibility of &quot;no hands&quot; landings of F-4 Phantom, F-8 Crusader and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft.

On 16 Oct 1965, two Phantom jets collided in midair from &quot;America&quot;, and both pilots ejected safely. On 3 September 1965 on the way to Taranto, a plane and pilot were lost when the catapult malfunctioned and tore the front landing gear off the plane; the plane&#x27;s auxiliary fuel tank ruptured, and the plane went over the side. An airman was burned in the catwalk and the RA ejected safely, but the pilot went down with the plane. Since leaving Norfolk, &quot;America&quot; had lost five planes.

From 28 November – 15 December, &quot;America&quot; took part in &quot;LANTFLEX 66&quot;, gaining experience in the areas of antiair, antisubmarine, and carrier strike operations. The ship also participated in a mine drop and missile shoots, and provided air support for amphibious operations. She returned to Norfolk on 15 December, remaining there through the end of the year 1966.

==Second deployment (1967)==
On 10 January 1967, &quot;America&quot; departed Norfolk for her second Mediterranean cruise and relieved at Pollensa Bay on 22 January. While crossing the Atlantic, &quot;America&quot; conducted: carrier qualifications for her SH-3A crews, missile shoots in the mid-Atlantic, day and night air operations and various other exercises. Upon nearing Gibraltar, she received a visit from Soviet long-range reconnaissance aircraft, Tu-95 &quot;Bears&quot; on 18 January. Two F-4B Phantom jets met the &quot;Bears&quot; as they approached and escorted them past the ship.

Before anchoring at Athens, on 4 February, &quot;America&quot; participated with Italian control and reporting centers in an intercept-controller exercise. Shortly afterwards, she again met with Italian forces in an exercise involving raids upon an attack carrier by fast patrol boats.

The beginning of March found &quot;America&quot; and her consorts, operating as Task Group 60.1 (TG 60.1)of Task Force 60, participating in the United States/United Kingdom exercise &quot;Poker Hand IV&quot; with the British carrier . &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot; provided raid aircraft to test each other&#x27;s antiaircraft defenses.

On 1 April, &quot;Dawn Clear&quot;, a two-day NATO exercise, commenced with TG 60.1 units participating. During the first day, &quot;America&quot; provided raid aircraft against Greek and Turkish &quot;targets&quot;. The following day, the exercise continued as Greek aircraft flew raids against TG 60.1 surface units. Following &quot;Dawn Clear&quot;, the ship conducted routine training operations in the Ionian Sea.

&quot;America&quot; anchored at Valletta at 10:00 on 5 April for a five-day visit. Weighing anchor on 10 April, the carrier departed Malta to sail for TG 60.1 operations in the Ionian Sea. She conducted an open sea missile exercise with the guided missile destroyers and . Other operational aspects of the at-sea period consisted of routine day/night flight operations and a major underway replenishment with other units of TG 60.1.

The following days saw the threat of civil war in Greece commencing with the military coup that ended parliamentary rule in that country. Although King Constantine II of Greece held his throne, the possibility of violence in the streets of Athens loomed as a potential threat to the American citizens suddenly caught up in the turmoil. Evacuation by ship seemingly might be necessary and the United States Sixth Fleet commander ordered the formation of a special operations task force. Under the command of Rear Admiral Dick H. Guinn, Task Force 65, with &quot;America&quot; as flagship, sailed eastward to stand by for evacuation, should that step be necessary. Fortunately, violence never materialized in Greece, and the task force was not called upon to act. On 29 April, Rear Admiral Lawrence R. Geis relieved Rear Admiral Guinn as Commander, Carrier Division 4, Commander, TF 60, Commander, TF 65, and Commander, TF 502 (NATO). With a new admiral on board, and the Greek political crisis behind her, &quot;America&quot; sailed into Taranto Harbor, Italy, on the first day of May for eight days of relaxation. During three days of general visiting in Taranto, &quot;America&quot; hosted 1,675 visitors, who came aboard to tour the hangar and flight decks. &quot;America&quot; and TG 60.1 departed Taranto on 8 May for routine operations in the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas, she followed these with a port visit to Livorno.

===Crisis in the Middle East===
By 25 May 1967, evidence arose that a crisis was brewing in the Middle East. As soon as the ship was slated to finish with the last of her &quot;Poop Deck&quot; exercises, she would be heading back to the Sea of Crete.

For the next 48 hours, &quot;America&quot; steamed east and south from the coast of Spain, through Malta Channel and on to the Sea of Crete to join up with the ships of TG 60.2, the carrier and her destroyers. The carrier task force, under the command of Rear Admiral Geis, prepared for any contingency.

The situation worsened. First, Egypt moved troops into the Gaza Strip, demanding that the United Nations (UN) Peacekeeping Force be withdrawn. Then, Israel beefed up her forces, and in turn, each of the other Arab countries put its armed forces on alert. As war clouds darkened, the United Arab Republic closed the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping.

During this time, the carrier conducted normal training operations off the island of Crete and held two major underway replenishment operations. On 5 June, seven American newsmen from the wire services, the three major American television networks, and several individual newspapers across the country flew on board. These seven were soon joined by others, 29 in all, including media representatives from England, Greece, and West Germany.

Their presence was evident everywhere on board the carrier. They lined the signal bridge and the flight deck, with their cameras recording the cycle of flight operations, refueling, and the tempo of shipboard routine. At night, Robert Goralski of NBC News and Bill Gill of ABC News teamed up to present the WAMR &quot;Gill-Goralski Report&quot;, a half-hour on the latest developments in the Mideast and around the world.

&quot;America&quot;″s presence was soon noted by the potential belligerents. The carrier also attracted other observers. A Soviet destroyer had maneuvered nearby in the morning of 2 June. Armed with surface-to-air missiles, the Russian ship constantly cut in and out of the carrier&#x27;s formation. Shortly after noon on 7 June, Vice Admiral William I. Martin, Commander 6th Fleet sent the following message to the Soviet ship, in Russian and English:
Although that particular Soviet guided missile destroyer left &quot;America&quot;, her sister ships soon arrived to follow the carrier and her escorting destroyers for days.

===The Six Day War===
On the morning of 5 June 1967, the Israelis and the Arabs were announced to be at war. That afternoon, the bosun&#x27;s pipe called the crew to a general quarters drill, and the excitement of the moment was evident as all hands rushed to their battle stations. When general quarters were secured, the word was passed over the 1-MC, the ship-wide general announcement system, to set condition three, an advanced state of defensive readiness.

On 7 June, the destroyer , in company with &quot;America&quot;, obtained a sonar contact, which was classified as a &quot;possible&quot; submarine. Rear Admiral Geis immediately dispatched &quot;Lloyd Thomas&quot; and the guided missile destroyer to investigate the contact. &quot;Sampson&quot; obtained contact quickly and coordinated with &quot;Lloyd Thomas&quot; in tracking the possible submarine.

&quot;America&quot; launched one of her antisubmarine helicopters, a Sikorsky SH-3A Sea King of Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron 9, and gained sonar contact. At midnight, the contact was reclassified as a &quot;probable&quot; submarine. At that time, no known or friendly submarines were reported to be in the area of the contact. The destroyers maintained good sonar contact through the night.

At 05:30 on 8 June, a Lockheed SP-2H Neptune antisubmarine patrol plane of Patrol Squadron 7, coordinating with the destroyers and helicopters, obtained a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) confirmation over the contact. The MAD equipment allows an ASW aircraft to confirm that a contact detected in the sea by other means is actually a very large metal object.

Rear Admiral Geis announced the &quot;probable&quot; submarine&#x27;s presence at noon. The newsmen, still embarked, dashed off stories to their home offices. Other events, however, soon overshadowed the story about a &#x27;probable&#x27; submarine lurking near an American carrier task force.

===Attack on USS &quot;Liberty&quot;===

At about 14:00 local time on 8 June 1967, the technical research ship was attacked by Israeli torpedo boats and jet fighters, about north of the Sinai port of El Arish, in international waters.

However, the first word that reached &quot;America&quot; and the Department of Defense in Washington gave no indication as to the identity of the attackers. &quot;America&quot;″s flight deck came alive. In a matter of minutes, F-4B Phantom interceptors were in the air to ward off any possible attack against task force units. At the same time, bombs and rockets moved from the magazines deep within the ship to the flight deck. Two A-4 Skyhawks were loaded and launched together with fighter cover. As the planes sped towards&quot; Liberty&#x27;s &quot;position, however, word was received from Tel Aviv that the attackers had been Israeli and that the attack had been made in error. The planes outbound from &quot;America&quot; were recalled with their ordnance still in the racks, with the A-4s landing ashore to unload their ordnance.

The attack on &quot;Liberty&quot; had cost the lives of 34 men, with 173 wounded. Admiral Martin dispatched two destroyers, and , with Lt. Cmdr. Peter A. Flynn, MC, USN, one of &quot;America&#x27;s&quot; junior medical officers, and two corpsmen from the carrier on board. The destroyers rendezvoused with &quot;Liberty&quot; at 06:00 on 9 June, and the medical personnel, including a second doctor from one of the destroyers, were transferred immediately to the damaged research ship.

At 10:30, two helicopters from &quot;America&quot; met with &quot;Liberty&quot; and began transferring the more seriously wounded to the carrier. An hour later, about east of Souda Bay Crete, &quot;America&quot; met with &quot;Liberty&quot;. The carrier&#x27;s crew lined every topside vantage point, silent, watching the helicopters bring 50 wounded and nine dead from &quot;Liberty&quot; to &quot;America&quot;. As &quot;Liberty&quot; drew alongside, listing, her sides perforated with rockets and cannon shell, nearly 2,000 of the carrier&#x27;s crew were on the flight deck, and spontaneously moved by the sight, gave the battered &quot;Liberty&quot; and her brave crew a tremendous cheer.

&quot;America&quot;″s medical team worked around the clock removing shrapnel, and treating various wounds and burns. Doctors Gordon and Flynn and Lieutenant Donald P. Griffith, MC, worked for more than 12 hours in the operating room, while other doctors, Lt. George A. Lucier and Lt. Frank N. Federico, made continuous rounds in the wards to aid and comfort the wounded. Their jobs were not finished that day, for the next week and more, &quot;Liberty&quot;″s wounded required constant attention.

Since the fighting had started between the Israelis and the Arabs, a quiet settled over the carrier&#x27;s flight deck. Ready, the ship waited for any possible situation, but the planes never left the decks.

As the Israeli forces moved to speedy victory in the Six-Day War, the Arabs charged that 6th Fleet aircraft were providing air cover for Israeli ground forces. The newsmen on board reported that these charges were false. The 6th Fleet, as with all other American forces, had remained neutral. In addition, the Soviet destroyers also knew the charges were false.

On Wednesday morning 7 June, Admiral Martin issued a statement to the press: 

The admiral gave members of the press copies of both &quot;America&quot;″s and &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s flight plans for the days in question and a rundown of the task force&#x27;s position at all times during the conflict. He pointed out that a check of the carriers&#x27; ordnance inventory would refute the charges, that both the number of pilots and aircraft embarked had changed only with the return of personnel and planes from the Paris Air Show.

&quot;America&quot; conducted a memorial service on 10 June, on the carrier&#x27;s flight deck.

==Atlantic and Mediterranean Service==

As Israeli forces advanced towards the Suez Canal and the Jordan River, and appeals for a cease-fire came, the tension relaxed aboard ship. The crew took time out for an 11-bout boxing smoker in the hangar bay. With a running commentary by the Gill-Goralski team, nearly 2,000 crew members crowded around the ring while others watched the action over closed circuit television. &quot;America&quot; continued on station for several more days, but the tension seemed to have gone. The newsmen left, the uninvited Soviet guests called no more, and regular flight operations resumed.

On a lighter note, during the same period, other activities were happening aboard ship, and in Paris, France. Two squadrons of CVW-6 participated in the 27th Paris Air Show held at the French capital&#x27;s Le Bourget Airport from 25 May – 5 June. A Fighter Squadron 33 (VF 33) F-4B Phantom II and an Early Warning Squadron 122 (VAW-122) Grumman E-2A Hawkeye were on display at the airfield throughout the show.

&quot;America&quot; next hosted, commencing on 14 June, forty-nine midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy and Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) units across the country. For six weeks the &quot;middies&quot;, under the watchful eyes of the ship&#x27;s officers, filled junior officer billets in all of the departments in the ship. In late July, the second group of 41 &quot;middies&quot; arrived for their six-week cruise.

&quot;America&quot; transited the Dardanelles on 21 June and arrived at Istanbul, where Rear Admiral Geis laid a wreath at the foot of the grave of the Unknown Soldier as a tribute to the Turkish war dead. Three days later, however, a group of angry demonstrators burned the wreath. Then, approximately 600 students with 1,500 spectators and sympathizers, participated in an anti-American/6th Fleet protest march, culminating in speeches in the area of the fleet landing. Liberty for the crew was cancelled for most of the afternoon-however, by early evening the situation had quieted down enough so that liberty could be resumed. All was peaceful for the remainder of the visit.

&quot;America&quot; departed Istanbul on 26 June for five days of operations in the Aegean Sea. On 1 July, the carrier steamed into the port of Thessaloniki, Greece for her first visit to that port. For Fourth of July celebrations aboard ship, Rear Admiral Geis and &quot;America&quot;″s commanding officer, Capt. Donald D. Engen hosted the Prefect of Thessaloniki, the Mayor of Thessaloniki, the American Consul and approximately 75 Greek Army officers and civilians. On 8 July, Rear Admiral Daniel V. Gallery USN (Ret.) arrived on board via &quot;COD&quot; (Carrier Onboard Delivery) aircraft. Admiral Gallery was visiting as many 6th Fleet ships as possible during his month stay in the Mediterranean to gather material for articles and books. He also departed by COD, on 9 July.

On 16 July, &quot;America&quot; anchored at Athens for her second visit to that port of the 1967 cruise, before she proceeded thence to Valletta on 29 July. On 7 August, &quot;America&quot; anchored in the Bay of Naples. After visits to Genoa and Valencia, the carrier sailed into Pollensa Bay and commenced the turnover of her 6th Fleet materials to her relief, the attack carrier .

&quot;America&quot; moored at Norfolk on 20 September and entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 6 October. She remained there, undergoing a restricted availability, into early January 1968. From 6–8 January, the ship steamed for three days of sea trials in the Virginia Capes operating area. After a four-day ammunition onload at anchorage X-ray in Hampton Bay and a brief stay at Norfolk, &quot;America&quot; departed for a month-long cruise to the Caribbean for the naval technical proficiency inspection (NTPI), refresher training with the Fleet Training Group, Guantánamo Bay, and type training in the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range (AFWR) before she could proceed to the Jacksonville Operating area for carrier qualifications.

&quot;America&quot; departed Norfolk on 16 January, arriving at Guantánamo Bay for extensive drills, exercises and inspections. General quarters was a daily routine as the ship strove to reach the peak of proficiency required in its upcoming combat deployment to the western Pacific (WestPac).

On 1 February, &quot;America&quot; departed the Guantanamo area, bound for the AFWR. The next day, 2 February, representatives from the AFWR came on board to brief &quot;America&quot; representatives and Carrier Air Wing 6 pilots on forthcoming operations. The training consisted of invaluable and highly successful exercises in environmental tracking, antimissile defense, airborne jamming against radars, emergency aircraft recovery, and simulated PT boat attacks. With this phase of her combat training completed, &quot;America&quot; departed the AFWR on 9 February for carrier qualifications in the Jacksonville operating area, and held them from the 12th through the 15th.

On the 17th, &quot;America&quot; moored at berths 23 and 24 at Norfolk Naval Shipyard to prepare for final type training, prior to her upcoming WestPac deployment. On 7 March, &quot;America&quot; again put to sea, back to the AFWR for further type training and exercise &quot;Rugby Match&quot;. &quot;En route&quot; to the Caribbean, the ship held various exercises in weapons loading, electronic countermeasures (ECM), and general quarters. On 10 March, &quot;America&quot; flew off the first of eight simulated air strikes. &quot;America&#x27;s&quot; CVW flew &quot;attack&quot; sorties against &quot;enemy&quot; positions on Vieques, Puerto Rico. A search and rescue exercise (SAREX) was conducted to test the ship and air wing response to the distress call of a downed aviator. She also held several missile defense exercises to test the ship&#x27;s reflexes against a surface threat.

&quot;America&quot;″s planes flew photographic reconnaissance sorties over Vieques, and &quot;found&quot; simulated targets on film. Communications exercises simulated conditions in Gulf of Tonkin, as a high volume of message traffic similar to that to be experienced in southeast Asia was generated by Commander, CarDiv 2, who was embarked in the ship. On 13 and 14 March, the weapons department also flexed their muscles by firing two Terrier missiles.

Exercise &quot;Rugby Match&quot;, a major Atlantic Fleet exercise involving approximately eighty ships was held in the AFWR from 7–29 March. &quot;America&quot; and Commander, CarDiv 2 (as commander, Task Group 26.1 (TG 26.1)), participated from the 18th to the 20th.

As the &quot;Blue&quot; Force attack carrier, &quot;America&quot; and her air wing pilots provided close air support (CAS), photo reconnaissance and combat air patrol (CAP) sorties for Task Force 22 (TF 22), the &quot;Blue&quot; amphibious landing force, during a landing on the island of Vieques. Prior to America&#x27;s main participation during this period, CVW-6 flew an aerial mining mission in the amphibious operating area on the 15th. D-Day was 19 March. On return from their missions as CAS and CAP, several aircraft tested the antiaircraft defenses of the task force by flying raids against &quot;America&quot;.

==Bound for Vietnam==
On 10 April 1968, &quot;America&quot; stood out of Hampton Roads, bound for &quot;Yankee Station&quot;, off the coast of Vietnam. The next day, the ship&#x27;s complement of men and machines was brought up to full strength as &quot;America&quot; recovered the remainder of CVW-6&#x27;s aircraft off the coast of the Carolinas. En route, she conducted one last major training exercise. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was the next stop en route to southeast Asia, &quot;America&quot;″s first to that city and continent. Now with her course set almost due east, &quot;America&quot; sailed through waters she had never traveled before. Across the southern Atlantic, around the Cape of Good Hope, past Madagascar and to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands. From Subic, the ship sailed northwest through the South China Sea towards &quot;Yankee Station&quot;. &quot;En route&quot;, on 26 May, the ship participated in exercise &quot;Newboy&quot; and the next day held carrier qualifications. At 10:00, 30 May, she arrived at &quot;Yankee Station, and at 06:30 the next morning the first aircraft since commissioning to leave her deck in anger was launched against the enemy.&quot;

During four line periods, consisting of 112 days on &quot;Yankee Station&quot;, &quot;America&quot;″s aircraft pounded at roads and waterways, trucks and waterborne logistics craft (WBLCS), hammered at petroleum storage areas and truck parks and destroyed bridges and cave storage areas in the attempt to impede the flow of men and war materials to the south. On 10 July 1968, Lt. Roy Cash, Jr. (pilot) and Lt. j.g. Joseph E. Kain, Jr. (radar intercept officer), in an F-4J Phantom from VF-33 downed a MiG-21 &#x27;Fishbed&#x27;, northwest of Vinh, North Vietnam, for the ship&#x27;s first MiG kill in the Vietnam War. America and her embarked air wing, CVW-6, would later be awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for their work during that time.

Between line periods, &quot;America&quot; visited Hong Kong, Yokosuka and Subic Bay. With &quot;America&quot;″s mission on &quot;Yankee Station&quot; nearing completion, she launched the last of her attack aircraft at 10:30 on 29 October. The next day, she set sail for Subic Bay and the offload of various &quot;Yankee Station&quot; assets. In addition, a heavy attack squadron, VAH-10, and an electronic countermeasures squadron, VA-130, departed the ship on 3 November as they began a transpacific movement of their entire detachments to Alameda, and 144 aviators along with several members of the ship&#x27;s company departed for the United States on the &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; flight.

The days the ship spent en route to Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, and Norfolk were, of necessity, more relaxed than those of her six months of combat. Nine hundred ninety-three &quot;Pollywogs&quot; were initiated into the realm of Neptunus Rex on the morning of 7 November as the ship again crossed the Equator. On 9 November, a flight deck &quot;cookout&quot; was sponsored by the supply department as the entire crew enjoyed char-broiled steaks and basked in the equatorial sun. After mooring at 13:30 on 16 December in Norfolk, her &quot;round-the-world&quot; cruise completed, post-deployment and holiday leave began, continuing through the first day of the year 1969.

On 8 January 1969, she headed for the Jacksonville operating area where she served as the platform for carrier qualifications. On 24 January, &quot;America&quot; arrived at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard to begin a nine-month overhaul. Upon completion of the overhaul, the carrier conducted post-repair trials and operated locally off the Virginia Capes. During one period of local operations, between 21 and 23 November 1969, &quot;America&quot; took part in carrier suitability tests for the Lockheed U-2R reconnaissance plane.

On 5 January 1970, the carrier departed the Norfolk area to commence a nine-week cruise in the Guantánamo Bay operating area. From 15 to 21 February, &quot;America&quot; participated in Operation &quot;SPRINGBOARD 70&quot;, the annual series of training exercises conducted in the Caribbean. The program was established to take advantage of good weather and the extensive modern training facilities, including targets of all kinds, which are available in order to achieve maximum training during the period. This exercise included submarine operations, air operations, and participation by the Marine Corps. At the completion of this testing and training, America departed the Guantanamo area to arrive at the Jacksonville area on 1 March in order to conduct carrier qualification landings with the various squadrons stationed in and around the Jacksonville/Cecil Field area.

&quot;America&quot; arrived in Norfolk on 8 March and remained there for approximately one month making last minute preparations for an eight-month deployment.

===Second Vietnam War deployment===
On 10 April 1970, with CVW-9 on board, &quot;America&quot; left Norfolk and paused briefly in the Caribbean for an operational readiness inspection before proceeding on a voyage that took her across the equator to Rio de Janeiro, round the Cape of Good Hope, across the Indian Ocean, into the Pacific Ocean and finally to Subic Bay in the Philippines.

On 26 May, &quot;America&quot; began its first day of special operations in the Gulf of Tonkin, when Cmdr. Fred M. Backman, commanding officer of VA-165, and his bombardier/navigator, Lt. Cmdr. Jack Hawley, in a Grumman A-6C Intruder flew the ship&#x27;s first combat sortie of the 1970 WestPac cruise. On the same day, the Navy&#x27;s newest light attack aircraft, the A-7E Corsair II received its first taste of combat. At 12:01, Lt. (j.g.) Dave Lichterman, of VA-146, was catapulted from the deck in the first A-7E ever to be launched in combat. He and his flight leader, Cmdr. Wayne L. Stephens, the squadron&#x27;s commanding officer, subsequently delivered their ordnance with devastating accuracy using the A-7E&#x27;s digital weapons computer. Shortly after 13:00, Cmdr R. N. Livingston, skipper of the &quot;Argonauts&quot; of VA-147, and Lt Cmdr. Tom Gravely rolled in on an enemy supply route to deliver the first bombs in combat in an A-7E, reportedly &quot;all on target&quot;.

For five line periods, consisting of 100 days on &quot;Yankee Station&quot;, &quot;America&quot;″s aircraft pounded at roads and waterways, trucks and waterborne logistic craft (WBLC), hammered at petroleum storage areas and truck parks in an attempt to impede the flow of men and war materials to the south.

On 20 August, at Manila, Vice Admiral Frederic A. Bardshar, Commander, Attack Carrier Striking Force, 7th Fleet, hosted the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand E. Marcos, on board &quot;America&quot;. Marcos was given a 21-gun salute as he and his wife Imelda Marcos arrived on board from their presidential yacht to visit the ship. Accompanied by U.S. ambassador Henry A. Byroade and his wife, they were greeted by Vice Admiral Bardshar and &quot;America&quot;″s commanding officer, Capt. Thomas B. Hayward and were subsequently escorted to the ship&#x27;s hangar deck where the carrier division band and the ship&#x27;s marine detachment rendered honors. Following their arrival, the visiting party dined with Vice Admiral Bardshar and Capt. Hayward, and were later given a brief tour of the ship.

On 17 September, &quot;America&quot; completed her fourth line period and headed for special operations off the coast of Korea and subsequently, the Sea of Japan. On 23 September, the carrier entered the Tsushima Straits, remained in the Sea of Japan for approximately five days and exited on 27 September through the Tsugaru Strait.

During this period, &quot;America&quot; and CVW-9 engaged in three exercises: &quot;Blue Sky&quot;, with elements of the Republic of China Air Force; &quot;Commando Tiger&quot;, conducted in the Sea of Japan, involving air units of the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF); and, after exiting the Tsugara Straits, &quot;Autumn Flower&quot;, air defense exercises with the Japanese Air Self Defense Force (JASDF) and the United States Fifth Air Force.

On 7 November, &quot;America&quot; completed her fifth line period and departed for her last visit to Subic Bay. Through five line periods, the carrier had flown off 10,600 sorties (7,615 combat plus combat support), 2,626 actual combat sorties, completed 10,804 carrier landings, expended 11,190 tons of ordnance, moved of cargo, handled 6,890 packages and transferred of mail. She had accomplished this without a single combat loss and only one major landing accident with fortunately, no fatalities.

The day before the carrier arrived at Sydney, Australia, for a three-day rest and recreation visit, United States ambassador to Australia and his wife, the Honorable and Mrs. Walter L. Rice, flew on board to accompany the ship into Sydney.

&quot;America&quot; celebrated two Thanksgivings. At exactly 23:29 on 26 November, &quot;America&quot; crossed the International Date Line. Moments later it became Thanksgiving Day again.

After rounding Cape Horn on 5 December 1970, &quot;America&quot; headed north, stopped briefly at Rio de Janeiro for fuel, and arrived in Norfolk, on 21 December. She remained there until 22 January 1971, when the ship entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a three-month restricted availability. She departed the yard, on schedule, on 22 March. Over the ensuing weeks, the ship operated locally in the Virginia Capes operating areas. She then carried out exercises in Puerto Rican waters, with United States Navy as well as Royal Navy warships-including , , and .

After a return to Norfolk, &quot;America&quot; stood out of Hampton Roads on 6 July 1971 for the Mediterranean. On 16 July 1971, America dropped anchor at Naval Station Rota, Spain in order to receive her turnover information from the ship she was relieving on station, &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;. &quot;America&quot; then entered the Mediterranean for the third time since her commissioning. Between the time the ship left Rota, until she reached Naples, she participated in three major exercises.

Following a port call at Naples, &quot;America&quot; proceeded on a course toward Palma, Majorca. While &quot;en route&quot;, she participated in &quot;PHIBLEX 2–71&quot;, in which she covered a mock amphibious landing at Capoteulada, Sicily. After a port visit at Palma, Majorca, &quot;America&quot; participated from 16 to 27 August in &quot;National Week X&quot;, one of the largest exercises conducted in the Mediterranean. At the termination of the exercise, America proceeded to Corfu, Greece, her next liberty port. She then visited Athens shortly afterwards.

After conducting routine operations in the eastern Mediterranean and making a port call at Rhodes, Greece, the ship proceeded to the Aegean Sea to participate in Operation &quot;Deep Furrow 71&quot;, &quot;America&quot; and CVW-8 providing close air support for almost the entire exercise.

Proceeding to Thessaloniki, Greece, for a port visit &quot;America&quot; then participated in &quot;National Week XI&quot;, in the central Mediterranean. The carrier subsequently visited Naples before she steamed into the western Mediterranean to participate in exercises with British, Dutch, Italian, and French forces in exercise &quot;Ile D&#x27;Or&quot;, completing her part in the evolutions by 19 November. America then conducted port visits to Cannes and Barcelona before proceeding to Rota. There, on 9 December, she was relieved on station by .

Arriving back at Norfolk on 16 December, &quot;America&quot; moored in Norfolk, for post-deployment stand down before unloading ammunition in preparation for availability at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. After the two-month overhaul, the carrier conducted sea trials. Soon afterwards America embarked on a program of training, accelerated due to the fact that the date of her deployment had been advanced one month, and participated in exercise &quot;Exotic Dancer V.&quot; She returned to Norfolk, upon conclusion of the exercises.

===Third deployment to Vietnam===
On 2 June 1972, three days before &quot;America&quot; was to sail Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt, the Chief of Naval Operations, visited the ship and explained the reason why her orders had been changed sending her to the Gulf of Tonkin instead of the Mediterranean. Sailing on 5 June, &quot;America&quot; crossed the equator on 12 June and held the usual initiation of &quot;pollywogs&quot; into the realm of Neptune.

Escorted by destroyers and , and accompanied by the fleet oiler , &quot;America&quot; proceeded toward southeast Asia, and rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 21 June. Joining the 7th Fleet later in June, &quot;America&quot; relieved the attack carrier on station, and commenced combat operations on 12 July. A ruptured main feed pump, however, prompted an early return to Subic Bay on 25 July for repairs, the ship arriving in the Philippines during a time of natural devastationfloods and landslides.

The repair work was delayed for two weeks while needed parts were rushed to Subic Bay. &quot;America&quot; stood out on 9 August to return to the line, and soon resumed carrying out strike operations against communist targets in North Vietnam. On 6 October, bombs from her planes dropped the Thanh Hoa Bridge, a major objective since the bombing of the North had begun years before.

Completing her line period and stopping over briefly at Subic Bay, &quot;America&quot; steamed to Singapore, departing that port on 20 October to resume operations on &quot;Yankee Station.&quot; Less than a month later, a fire broke out on board &quot;America&quot;, at 14:10 on 19 November 1972, in the number two catapult spaces. The ship went to general quarters as smoke began to fill the 03 level, and damage control parties soon had the blaze extinguished. Clean-up and repair work ensued, and despite not having the services of one of her catapults, &quot;America&quot; remained on the line and continued to meet her commitments.

After an extended line period of 43 days, &quot;America&quot; reached Subic Bay on 2 December, where the number two catapult was repaired, and departed the Philippines on 8 December to return to &quot;Yankee Station&quot;. A week before Christmas, &quot;America&quot; learned that the breakdown of peace talks in Paris had led to a resumption of bombing of targets in North Vietnam. &quot;America&quot; swung into action, and the pace proved hectic until the Christmas cease-fire. &quot;Christmas away from home is never good&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s&quot; historian wrote, &quot;but the men of &quot;America&quot; made the best of it with homemade decorations.&quot; There were services to celebrate the season, &quot;and carolers were noted strolling through the passageways ...&quot;

&quot;America&quot; received five battle stars for her service in the Vietnam War.

===Cessation of hostilities===
On 28 December, the carrier anchored in Hong Kong harbor, and remained there until 4 January 1973, when she stood out for the Philippines and the period of rest and repairs at Subic Bay that would precede the ship&#x27;s return to the line. All hands avidly followed the progress of the peace talks as &quot;America&quot; returned to &quot;Yankee Station&quot;, and resumed operations. After two weeks on the line, the ship learned that peace had been secured and that an agreement was to be signed in Paris. At 08:00 on 28 January 1973, the Vietnam Warat least that stage of itwas at an end. Rumors swept the ship that her deployment would be shortened because of the cessation of hostilities, and hope ran high as the ship moored at Subic Bay on 3 February.

America did return to &quot;Yankee Station&quot; one last time, but her time on station proved short, as she returned to Subic Bay on 17 February and sailed thence for the United States three days later, on 20 February. The carrier arrived at Mayport Florida, disembarking men from CVW-8 and embarking the teen-aged sons of some of the ship&#x27;s company officers and men, thus allowing them to ride the ship back to Norfolk with their fathers.

On 24 March, &quot;America&quot; arrived back at Norfolk, bringing to a close her sixth major deployment since commissioning. She immediately began preparations for a 30-day stand down and the restricted availability to follow at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. She entered the yard on 11 May and emerged after that period of repairs and alterations on 10 August.

&quot;America&quot; conducted local operations out of Norfolk into October, and during this period the ship celebrated a significant milestone in the life of a carrier: she logged her 100,000th landing on 29 August 1973, when her COD aircraft (nicknamed &quot;Miss America&quot;), piloted by Lt. Cmdr. Lewis R. Newby and Lt. Cmdr. Ronnie B. Baker, landed on board. Cake-cuttings on the hangar deck and in the wardroom celebrated the occasion.

On 29 October, &quot;America&quot; cleared Hampton Roads for Jacksonville and a period of carrier qualifications. She was conducting routine training operations on 1 November when she went to the assistance of the crippled sailing schooner &quot;Harry W. Adams&quot; of Nova Scotia. The schooner, her engine disabled and without power for her pumps, was taking on water. Helicopters from &quot;America&quot; sped to the scene, and the ship provided rescue specialists and underwater demolition experts to assist in the effort. The ship&#x27;s captain and his crew of nine all escaped serious injury, although the carrier&#x27;s helicopters brought three of the crew on board for medical examinations and a warm meal. America stood by until the late afternoon, when the Coast Guard cutter &quot;PORT ROBERTS&quot; arrived to assist &quot;Harry W. Adams&quot; into port at Jacksonville.

After concluding her operations in the Jacksonville area &quot;America&quot; paid a port call at Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, from 4–8 November. She proceeded thence to sea for exercises of various kinds to hone the skills of the ship-air wing team and, following her operational readiness inspection off Mayport, proceeded back to Norfolk, on 21 November.

&quot;America&quot; then steamed south after the Thanksgiving holiday, for Atlantic Fleet readiness exercises, returned via Mayport to Norfolk on 13 December, and remained in her home port until sailing for the Mediterranean on 3 January 1974.

Relieving &quot;Independence&quot; at Rota, Spain, on 11 January, she became the flagship for Rear Admiral Frederick C. Turner, Commander, TF 60. &quot;America&quot; commenced operations in the western Mediterranean that day and, over the next few weeks; divided her time between at-sea periods and port visits to Toulon, Barcelona, and Valencia. From 15 to 19 February, the carrier participated in exercise &quot;National Week XVI&quot;, and upon the conclusion of that evolution anchored in Souda Bay, Crete. She proceeded thence for a port call at Athens.

Standing out of the waters of that Greek port on 1 March, &quot;America&quot; participated in &quot;PHIBLEX 9–74&quot;, in which the ship&#x27;s air wing, CVW, practiced supporting an amphibious landing. The carrier then operated north of Crete on exercises in early April, after which time she put into Athens on 9 April.

&quot;America&quot; then participated in NATO exercise, &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot;, in which units of the navies of the United States, United Kingdom, Portugal, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and West Germany participated. During one phase of this exercise, the carrier&#x27;s marine detachment embarked in and stormed ashore from that amphibious ship while &quot;America&quot;″s planes provided close air support.

Upon the conclusion of Dawn Patrol, the carrier paid another visit to Athens, proceeding thence on 19 May for a four-day period of exercises, after which time she steamed to Istanbul, arriving there on 23 May.

Immediately following this port call, the ship returned to Athens and sailed thence for exercise &quot;Shahbaz&quot; to test the air defense capability of NATO ally Turkey early in June. America then anchored off the island of Rhodes, Greece, on 6 June for a four-day port visit, after which time she returned to Athens to embark Naval Academy midshipmen for their summer training cruise. America then participated in exercise &quot;Flaming Lance&quot;, off the coast of Sardinia, during which time controlled over 1,000 intercepts by &quot;America&quot;″s aircraft.

Making her last port call at Athens for the deployment, the carrier steamed to Souda Bay on 1 July, loading minesweeping equipment that had been used in Operation Nimbus Star, the clearance of the Suez Canal. &quot;America&quot; then proceeded to Corfu, and began the transit out of the eastern Mediterranean on 6 July, arriving at Palma, Majorca, three days later.

&quot;America&quot; anchored off Rota on 15 July, for what was scheduled to have been an off-load of the equipment of Commander, TF 60, staff. Clashes between Greek and Turkish forces on Cyprus, however, prompted the Joint Chiefs of Staff to order &quot;America&quot; to remain at Rota until the arrival of her relief, &quot;Independence&quot;, on 28 July. As soon as that attack carrier entered the 6th Fleet operating area, &quot;America&quot; commenced her homeward voyage, ultimately reaching Norfolk, on 3 August.

A little over a month later, &quot;America&quot; sailed for the North Sea, to participate in a NATO exercise, &quot;Northern Merger&quot;, departing Norfolk on 6 September. &quot;America&quot; joined with HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; in providing air support for a NATO task force and for an amphibious landing. Throughout the exercise Soviet surface units, as well as &quot;Bear&quot; and Tu-16 &#x27;Badger&#x27; aircraft, conducted surveillance missions over and near the NATO force.

Upon the conclusion of &quot;Northern Merger&quot;, America steamed to Portsmouth, England, arriving there on 29 September to commence a five-day port visit. The carrier proceeded thence back to the United States, reaching Norfolk on 12 October, to commence preparations for a major overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Entering the yard on 27 November 1974, &quot;America&quot; remained there until 27 September 1975, when the ship got underway to conduct post-overhaul sea trials.

&quot;America&quot; departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 16 October 1975 for local operations off the Virginia Capes and, after a few weeks in Norfolk, departed Hampton Roads for Cuban waters and refresher training.

While steaming north of Cuba and preparing for the operational readiness inspection that concludes refresher training, &quot;America&quot; picked up distress calls, immediately deploying helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to search for a disabled motorized sailboat, &quot;Ruggentino&quot;. One of the carrier&#x27;s helicopters located a boat in distress and guided a tug to the scene which took the disabled craft in tow. The boat, however, was the &quot;Content&quot;, so &quot;America&quot; and her aircraft resumed the search for &quot;Ruggentino&quot;. One of her planes soon located &quot;Ruggentino&quot;, and the ship dispatched a motor whaleboat to assist. &quot;America&quot; sailors soon had the boat pumped out and headed for port.

&quot;America&quot; completed her schedule of training in Cuban waters and then returned north, arriving back at Norfolk on 16 December 1975. Following the year-end stand down, the carrier resumed local operations out of Norfolk in January 1976 and, in March participated in exercise &quot;Safe Pass &#x27;76&quot; with ships of the Canadian, West German, Dutch and British navies. She ultimately sailed for the Mediterranean on 15 April 1976 with CVW-6 and Commander, Carrier Group 4 (CarGru 4), Rear Admiral James B. Linder, embarked.

==Crisis in Lebanon==
Soon after her arrival in the turnover port of Rota, &quot;America&quot; participated in a NATO exercise, &quot;Open Gate&quot;, before entering the Mediterranean. Passing the Pillars of Hercules on 3 May, the ship entered into the eastern Mediterranean in support of Operation &quot;Fluid Drive&quot;, a contingency operation for the evacuation of non-combatants from war-torn Lebanon. For the next three months, the carrier maintained a high state of readiness. In conjunction with &quot;Fluid Drive&quot;, the ship and her air wing maintained continuous surveillance of the Soviet Mediterranean fleet, which at that point was at its largest since the Yom Kippur War of 1973.

On 24 May, &quot;America&quot; anchored in Rhodes, Greece, to commence her first liberty of the deployment-but violent anti-American demonstrations prevented the carrier&#x27;s crew from going ashore, and the ship stood out two days later. &quot;America&quot; conducted a port visit to Taranto Italy, instead, but the deteriorating situation in the eastern Mediterranean required the ship to sail sooner than scheduled.

The assassination of the United States ambassador to Lebanon Francis E. Meloy, and Economic Counselor Robert O. Waring as they were on their way to visit Lebanese President Elias Sarkis on 16 June 1976 prompted the evacuation of Americans from that nation a week later, on the 20th. America remained on alert while landing craft from the dock landing ship transferred the evacuees from the beach to safety. Following the successful evacuation, the carrier proceeded westward for a few days of liberty in Italian ports celebrating the country&#x27;s bicentennial Independence Day, 4 July 1976, at Bari, Italy.

Proceeding back into the eastern Mediterranean on 11 July to conduct a missile exercise north of Crete, the ship continued to maintain responsibility for &quot;Fluid Drive.&quot; On 27 July, as more Americans were evacuated from Lebanon on board , the carrier provided support. Relieved of her responsibilities in the eastern Mediterranean on 2 August, &quot;America&quot; reached Naples soon afterwards, and remained in port for two weeks. The carrier returned to sea on 18 August and participated in exercise &quot;National Week XXI&quot; with other 6th Fleet units.

Upon the termination of &quot;National Week XXI&quot;, &quot;America&quot; proceeded to Palma, whence she proceeded to participate in &quot;Poop Deck 76&quot; with Spanish Air Force units and United States Air Force units based in Spain. Then, following visits to the Spanish ports of Barcelona and Málaga, America took part in the final exercise of her Mediterranean cruise, exercise &quot;Display Determination&quot;. teamed with &quot;America&quot;, and ships from the navies of Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Turkey participated as well. The American carrier conducted convoy escort duties, simulated close air support for amphibious operations, and simulated strikes against military targets. Upon conclusion of &quot;Display Determination&quot;, the carrier proceeded to Rota, where she was relieved by &quot;Franklin D. Roosevelt&quot;. &quot;America&quot; ultimately reached Norfolk on 25 October 1976.

On 6 November, the carrier proceeded up the Elizabeth River to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard, where she remained into February 1977. America then operated locally out of Norfolk into the spring of 1977 until sailing for the Mayport, Florida, operating area on 3 May. Following her participation in exercise &quot;Solid Shield 77&quot;, a joint service amphibious training exercise, the carrier returned to Norfolk on 24 May.

&quot;America&quot; sailed from Hampton Roads on 10 June 1977 for a five-week South Atlantic deployment as a unit of TG 20.4. Other ships in company included , , , and . Following her return to Norfolk, &quot;America&quot; operated locally before she sailed to conduct operations in the Caribbean.

After returning to Norfolk on 27 August, &quot;America&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean on 29 September, with CVW-6 embarked, and reached Rota on 9 October. Departing that port on 14 October the carrier proceeded to the Tyrrhenian Sea, where she operated until 26 October. Following a port call at Brindisi, Italy, &quot;America&quot; began operations in the Ionian Sea on 7 November, and anchored at Souda Bay, Crete, two days later. She operated locally in these waters until 12 November, when she sailed for Kithira Island, Greece, anchoring there on the 19th.

Weighing anchor the following morning, &quot;America&quot; sailed for the Adriatic Sea, bound for Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia. Visiting this seaport from 22 to 26 November, the carrier transited the Adriatic for a port call at Trieste, staying there from 28 November to 3 December. Returning to operate in the waters of Souda Bay for more exercises, &quot;America&quot; subsequently departed Crete on 12 December for Palma, where she spent Christmas.

Departing Palma two days later, &quot;America&quot; proceeded through the Ligurian Sea to her next port of call, Genoa, which she reached on 30 December. She remained there until 8 January 1978, when she sailed to carry out antisubmarine exercises in the Tyrrhenian Sea, upon the conclusion of which she anchored in Golfo di Palma, Sicily. Operations in the western Mediterranean and again in the Tyrrhenian Sea rounded out most of January 1978, and the ship rested briefly at Catania, Italy, before getting underway for exercise &quot;National Week&quot; on 5 February.

She returned to the Tyrrhenian Sea and western Mediterranean for further exercises during March, and then visited Barcelona before she brought the deployment to a close with further exercises in the western Mediterranean. At Rota, she was relieved by , and sailed for Norfolk, arriving home on 25 April 1978.

Following post-deployment stand down, &quot;America&quot; conducted carrier qualifications off the Virginia Capes, and then entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard for an availability. Upon the conclusion of that period of repairs and alterations, the carrier conducted post-availability sea trials on 19–20 September 1978, and conducted carrier qualifications with CVW from 12 to 20 October. Tragedy marred the last day of operations, when a Lockheed S-3 Viking antisubmarine aircraft went over the side upon landing; hung on the safety nets momentarily, then plunged into the sea. Although the pilots, Lt. Cmdr. Ziolowski and Lt. (j.g.) Renshaw ejected clear of the plane, they were not recovered.

&quot;America&quot; subsequently conducted refresher training out of Guantánamo Bay early in November, before she called at Ft. Lauderdale on 10 November to commence a four-day stay. Returning to Norfolk soon afterwards, the carrier remained in the Norfolk area, alternating periods of time in port with type-training and exercises off the Virginia Capes.

The carrier cleared Norfolk on 5 January 1979 for the Caribbean operating areas, and conducted type training there from 5–23 January after which time the ship visited St. Thomas, in the U.S. Virgin Islands, from 24 to 29 January. &quot;America&quot; then resumed type training in the waters of the Caribbean and West Indies, concluding those evolutions on 12 February to return to Norfolk.

After bringing CVW-11 on board off the Virginia Capes on 8 and 9 March, &quot;America&quot; spent the next two days moored in Norfolk making final preparations for her departure for the Mediterranean. The carrier sailed on 13 March. Two days later, on 15 March, &quot;America&quot; conducted a &quot;BEAREX&quot; with a Lockheed P-3 Orion from Bermuda simulating a Russian &quot;Bear&quot; reconnaissance aircraft. Such practice proved timely, for the following day, A-7 and Grumman F-14 Tomcat aircraft from &quot;America&quot; intercepted a pair of the long-range &quot;Bear D&quot; planes that were &quot;en route&quot; to Cuba from their bases in the Soviet Union. The &quot;Bears&quot; never came within visual range of the carrier&#x27;s battle group.

Reaching Rota on 24 March, &quot;America&quot; relieved and commenced operations in the western Mediterranean on 29 March. During this deployment, the ship visited a variety of ports, starting with Naples, Taranto, and Catania. Moving into the Adriatic, the carrier stopped at Split, Croatia, before moving north to Venice and Trieste. In the eastern Mediterranean, America called at Alexandria, Egypt, at Souda Bay, Crete. Returning west, she visited Palma and Barcelona in Spain, Marseille on the coast of France, Genoa in northern Italy and Valencia in Spain before heading for Rota. She completed turnover proceedings at Rota on 10–11 September 1979, and got underway immediately to commence the homeward voyage.

Highlighting this period were numerous multilateral and unilateral exercises, as in previous Mediterranean deployments. During one phase of &quot;National Week XXVII&quot;, &quot;America&quot; and her consorts took part in an open sea exercise that took them into the waters of the Gulf of Sidra (Sirte) – claimed by Libya as territorial waters since 11 October 1973. The Libyan government serving notice that any ship or aircraft operating south of the 32-30 north latitude would be violating its territory, &quot;America&quot;″s battle group maintained an alert, in view of the proximity of Libyan airfields and Soviet-made aircraft operating therefrom. Departing Augusta Bay, Sicily, on 26 July, the task group arrived in its exercise area on the 28th. As planes from CVW-11 maintained nearly continuous fighter cover, the ships conducted their exercise unhindered.

Ultimately departing Rota on 12 September 1979 to conduct a blue water turnover with , &quot;America&quot; encountered her second pair of &quot;Bears&quot;. F-14 Tomcats of VF-213 intercepted the two, however, and caused them to turn away to the north, having never sighted a single ship in the carrier&#x27;s battle group. Reaching Norfolk on 22 September, &quot;America&quot; stood down after her 6th Fleet deployment.

The carrier departed Norfolk again on 15 October for Mayport, and conducted local operations off the coast of Florida before moving into the Gulf of Mexico to conduct carrier qualifications. Returning north upon completion of those evolutions, &quot;America&quot; put to sea on 30 October for more carrier qualifications-these, however, involved the first arrested carrier landings of the new McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. This aircraft underwent rigorous testing over the days which followed, before &quot;America&quot; returned to Norfolk on 3 November.

Entering the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 6 November 1979, &quot;America&quot; underwent repairs and alterations for much of 1980 commencing her post-repair trials on 23 September 1980. Among the work performed during the availability was the installation of the NATO &quot;Sea Sparrow&quot; missile and close-in weapon systems such as the multi-barreled &quot;Phalanx&quot; machine gun.

The ship carried out a second period of post-repair trials from 16 to 21 October, after which time she returned to Norfolk whence she conducted sea trials from 27 to 29 October. Subsequently, conducting refresher training out of Guantánamo Bay, &quot;America&quot; returned to the Virginia Capes operating area to conduct carrier qualifications in early December. She spent the remainder of the year 1980, undergoing upkeep at Norfolk.

&quot;America&quot; operated locally in the Virginia Capes area into January 1981 and, during these operations on 14 January 1981, brought on board a Grumman C-1A &quot;Trader&quot; COD aircraft piloted by Ens. Brenda Robinson, USNR. Ens. Robinson became the first black female naval aviator to be carrier qualified. The ship later conducted carrier qualifications for CVW-11.

On 29 January 1981, as &quot;America&quot; was returning to Norfolk, she received a message from a Greek motor vessel, &quot;Aikaterini&quot;, in distress. &quot;America&quot;, diverted to the scene to render assistance until the Coast Guard could arrive, sent helicopters from her embarked HS-12 with damage control equipment, members of the ship&#x27;s fire department, and damage control assistance to the stricken ship.

Returning to Norfolk on 2 February, &quot;America&quot; proceeded thence for carrier qualifications off the Virginia Capes, and thence to the Caribbean for type training. Returning to Norfolk on 19 March, &quot;America&quot; – in company with her consorts and subsequently sailed for the Mediterranean on 14 April 1981, destined, ultimately, for the Indian Ocean.

Reaching Palma on 23 April, &quot;America&quot; then participated in NATO exercise &quot;Daily Double&quot;, with the amphibious assault ship , as well as with Greek and Italian Navy units on the 28th before she steamed to Port Said, Egypt.

Originally scheduled to have commenced her transit of the Suez Canal on 5 May, the tense situation in Lebanon prompted a 24-hour &quot;hold&quot; on the evolution. Given the go-ahead soon after, &quot;America&quot; made the transit on 6 May, in ten hours – the first United States Navy carrier to steam through the Suez Canal since had made the passage shortly before the Arab-Israeli &quot;Six-Day War&quot; of 1967. It was also the first &quot;super-carrier&quot; to transit the canal since it had been modified to permit passage of supertankers.

&quot;America&quot; operated in the Indian Ocean, on &quot;Gonzo&quot; Station, for the first time from 12 May – 3 June, after which time she visited Singapore. On 18 June, the carrier departed that port for her second stint on &quot;Gonzo Station&quot;. This deployment was to last 35 days. &quot;America&quot; and her embarked air wing provided a vital U.S. presence in the North Arabian Sea and ensured freedom of the seas for all nations operating ships through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf. These operations were conducted in a routine manner through three line periods (except for the loss of the ship&#x27;s anchor while mooring off of Masirah Island).

On 15 July, &quot;America&quot; was requested to provide search and rescue (SAR) aircraft to assist in locating a merchant ship in distress in the northern Arabian Sea. The Greek merchantman &quot;Irene Sincerity&quot; was reportedly afire. &quot;America&quot;″s planes located the ship and &quot;California&quot; rescued the 39 crewmen and disembarked them in good condition in Karachi, Pakistan.

Upon completion of her second northern Arabian Sea line period on 4 August, &quot;America&quot; shaped a course for Australian waters conducting a &quot;Weapons Week&quot; exercise in the vicinity of Diego Garcia. During &quot;Weapons Week&quot;, a Lockheed P-3 &quot;Orion&quot; of Patrol Squadron (VP) 50 requested two F-14 Tomcats from America, flying in the vicinity of Pierre Island, near Diego Garcia, to assist in contacting their ship for SAR assistance. &quot;California&quot; sped to the island and located an individual stranded on Pierre Island, he had been on a treasure-hunting expedition bound from Sri Lanka to Mauritius. The cruiser took the man to Diego Garcia.

Departing the Diego Garcia operating area on 15 August, &quot;America&quot; conducted a unique burial-at-sea on the 18th, when the remains of the late Lt. Stephen O. Musselman were consigned to the ocean. Musselman had been shot down on 10 September 1972 in an A-7 Corsair II from &quot;America&quot;, over North Vietnam, and his remains had been returned by the Vietnamese government on 8 July 1981. Lt. Musselman&#x27;s widow requested that these remains be consigned to the last ship he had served in and buried thence.

&quot;America&quot; anchored in Gage Roads at Fremantle, Western Australia on 25 August, and remained there for six days, sailing for &quot;Gonzo Station&quot; on the 31st. During her third line period, the ship spent 34 days on station. On 23 September, a fire broke out in a steam trunk line that carries steam from the main engineering spaces to the flight deck catapult system, at about 17:45. Soon after &quot;America&quot;″s fire party arrived on the scene to isolate the fire, smoke began filling the areas adjacent to the crew berthing areas, so Capt. James F. Dorsey, Jr., ordered general quarters sounded.

&quot;America&#x27;s&quot; firefighters soon managed to quell the blaze, and the ship secured from battle stations at 23:16. The carrier resumed normal flight operations the next morning at sunrise, and remained on station until relieved by &quot;Coral Sea&quot; on 16 October. Two days later, while &quot;America&quot; steamed toward the Bab el Mandeb Strait, the ship went to general quarters, in view of threats issued by the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Yemen. The ship passed without incident, and continued her journey through the Red Sea unhindered.

On 21 October 1981, &quot;America&quot; commenced the northbound transit of the Suez Canal. This transit, unlike the comparatively light-hearted one of 6 May, proved more tense. As a result of the unsettled conditions in Egypt following 6 October 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian government accorded &quot;America&quot;″s passage through the Suez Canal the utmost security considerations. The Egyptian Navy provided a patrol vessel to escort the carrier, while an Egyptian Air Force helicopter conducted reconnaissance flight over both banks of the waterway. Egyptian Army units patrolled the adjacent canal roads. Additionally, liaison officers on board the carrier maintained constant touch with the security forces by radio.

Making the passage of the canal without incident, &quot;America&quot; continued on across the Mediterranean, reaching Palma on 25 October. After a three-day port call, the carrier conducted exercises with Spanish forces, and subsequently sailed for home on 1 November, departing the Mediterranean the following day. She arrived at Norfolk on 12 November.

Following a short stand down, &quot;America&quot; conducted carrier qualifications in the Virginia Capes operating area, before she moored at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 14 December. Emerging from the naval shipyard on 20 April 1982, &quot;America&quot; operated locally off the Virginia Capes. Departing Norfolk on 10 May, the ship steamed to the Guantánamo Bay operating area and returning to her home port on 28 May.

Following further carrier qualifications off the Virginia Capes the carrier then steamed south to conduct type training in the West Indies, interspersing these evolutions with a port visit to St. Thomas. Returning to Norfolk on 8 July, &quot;America&quot; operated locally from 22 to 24 July, before she sailed on 22 August, with CVW-1 embarked, to participate in joint NATO exercises &quot;United Effort&quot; and &quot;Northern Wedding 82&quot;.

&quot;America&quot; visited Edinburgh, Scotland, from 15 to 21 September and proceeded thence to Portsmouth, England, arriving there on 23 September. Sailing for the Mediterranean on 26 September, the carrier operated briefly with the 6th Fleet, participating in exercise &quot;Display Determination&quot; from 30 September – 8 October. She then sailed for the United States, and, following her operational readiness evaluation in the Caribbean operating areas, reached Mayport to disembark CVW-1. &quot;America&quot; returned to Norfolk on 4 November.

==Returning to Lebanon==

&quot;America&quot; departed Norfolk on 8 December 1982, proceeded to the Virginia Capes operating area and embarked CVW-1, and set out across the Atlantic. Visiting Palma on 22 December America remained there through the Christmas holiday, weighing anchor on 28 December to sail for the Lebanese coast, where she was to take up duty in support of the Multinational Peacekeeping Force in strife-torn Lebanon. Relieving USS &quot;Nimitz&quot; on station on 2 January 1983, &quot;America&quot; spent the next 18 days off Lebanon, before &quot;Nimitz&quot; took over on 20 January. Steaming thence to Piraeus, Greece, &quot;America&quot;, along with and , anchored there on 23 January for a five-day port visit to Athens.

Underway on 29 January, the carrier transited the Sea of Crete en route to an overnight anchorage at Port Said. Transiting the Suez Canal on 31 January, &quot;America&quot; reached the Red Sea the same day and reported for duty with the 7th Fleet on 4 February. On 9 February, the carrier and her accompanying battle group conducted exercise &quot;Beacon Flash 83&quot;. Subsequently, on 28 February, America and her consorts conducted a &quot;Weapons Week&quot; exercise in the vicinity of Diego Garcia. Following those evolutions, the carrier visited Colombo, Sri Lanka, anchoring on 7 March. Weighing anchor on 12 March, &quot;America&quot; resumed operations in the Indian Ocean soon afterwards, culminating in &quot;Beacon Flash 83-4&quot;, and a subsequent port visit to Masirah Island, Oman.

Steaming thence to Mombasa, Kenya, and a five-day port visit &quot;America&quot; departed that port for a week of intense flight operations, followed by participation in &quot;Beacon Flash 85&quot; on 19 April. Returning to anchor at Masirah Island again three days later, the carrier and her battle group operated in the northern Arabian Sea, en route to the Suez Canal. Transiting that waterway on 4 May, &quot;America&quot; headed for Souda Bay, reaching an anchorage there on 7 May. Five days later, the carrier got underway for Málaga, Spain, reaching her destination on 14 May for a nine-day port visit. The ship subsequently departed Málaga on 23 May, and reached Norfolk on 2 June.
&quot;America&quot; then entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 8 July. For four months, the ship underwent a period of repairs and alterations, emerging from the yard on 28 October. She then operated locally off the Virginia Capes with CVW-1 embarked, before she proceeded thence to Mayport, and, ultimately, to Puerto Rican waters for refresher training. Subsequently, visiting Nassau, in the Bahamas, for a five-day port visit, &quot;America&quot; returned to the East Coast of the United States, reaching Mayport on 8 December. She then conducted carrier qualifications for both East and West Coast squadrons en route to her home port reaching Norfolk on 14 December.

The carrier operated locally from Norfolk into February 1984 alternating periods of upkeep in port with carrier qualifications and exercises. She then conducted two periods of type training (6–20 February and 25 March – 8 April), interspersing these with an in-port period at Ft. Lauderdale from 21 to 24 February and then calling at St. Thomas upon conclusion of the second period of training. Returning to Norfolk on 22 March, &quot;America&quot; spent the next month preparing for her next deployment, and got underway to participate in exercise &quot;Ocean Venture&quot; on 24 April. Visiting Caracas, Venezuela, upon conclusion of that evolution, &quot;America&quot; departed on 9 May for the Mediterranean.

Reaching Málaga, Spain, on 21 May, the carrier commenced her transit of the Mediterranean on 29 May and reached Port Said on 3 June. Transiting the Suez Canal on the following day she passed through the Red Sea and joined the 7th Fleet on 8 June, relieving &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;. On 10 July, while operating in the Indian Ocean, &quot;America&quot; lost an EA-6B Prowler from the VAQ-135 Black Ravens due to a failure of the waist catapult system. The crew ejected but the pilot, LTJG Michael Debartolomeo was killed in the process. An investigation into the Class A mishap revealed that faulty maintenance of the catapult system was to blame. Returning to the 6th Fleet on 29 August, &quot;America&quot; transited the Suez Canal on 2 September bound for Naples.

The carrier visited Monaco from 13 to 22 September before she participated in one phase of NATO exercise, &quot;Display Determination&quot;. After stopping briefly to Naples, &quot;America&quot; returned to sea soon afterwards, and took part in the second phase of &quot;Display Determination&quot; before visiting Catania. She reached Augusta Bay on 27 October, where she was relieved by and sailed for the United States.

Arriving at Norfolk on 14 November, &quot;America&quot; conducted carrier qualifications in the Virginia Capes operating areas from 29 November – 17 December before returning to port on 18 December. The ship remained in an upkeep status until 18 January 1985, when she shifted to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for overhaul.

Emerging from the yard on 13 May for sea trials off the Virginia Capes, &quot;America&quot; remained at Norfolk until 28 May, when she sailed to conduct refresher training. Then, following a port call at Port Everglades, Florida (13–17 June), &quot;America&quot; conducted carrier qualifications before returning to Norfolk on 25 June. The ship operated locally out of Norfolk through mid-August.

&quot;America&quot; sailed on 24 August to participate in &quot;Ocean Safari&quot;, a six-week NATO exercise which ultimately took her to Norwegian waters. After visiting Portsmouth, United Kingdom, upon conclusion of her training, &quot;America&quot; returned to Norfolk on 9 October. She spent the remainder of the year 1985 alternating periods of upkeep in Norfolk, with local operations in the Virginia Capes operating area.

==Crisis in Libya==
As the new year 1986 began, tensions in the Mediterranean basin would result in &quot;America&quot;″s sailing to deploy with the 6th Fleet one month earlier than planned. On 7 January 1986, President Ronald Reagan ordered all U.S. citizens out of Libya, and broke off all remaining ties between the two nations. At the same time, President Reagan directed the dispatch of a second carrier battle group to the Mediterranean, and directed the Joint Chiefs of Staff to look into military operations against Libya, a country strongly suspected of fomenting terrorist activity.

Operations near Libya began at the end of January. These evolutions, collectively named &quot;Attain Document&quot;, were carried out from 24 to 31 January 1986 and from 10 to 15 February, by surface ships and aircraft. &quot;America&quot;, with CVW-1 embarked, and her accompanying battle group departed Norfolk on 10 March 1986, and arrived in the Mediterranean in time to participate in the third phase of &quot;Attain Document&quot;, a freedom of navigation (FON) exercise in the Gulf of Sidra.

Late on 23 March, American planes flew south of latitude 32-30° N – the &quot;Line of Death&quot; proclaimed by Libyan leader Muammar al-Qadaffi. On 24 March, , accompanied by two destroyers, and , moved south of the &quot;Line&quot;, covered by fighter aircraft, at 06:00.

A Libyan missile installation near Surt (Sirte) launched two Soviet-made SA-5 &quot;Gammon&quot; surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) at 07:52, toward F-14A Tomcats of &quot;America&quot;″s VF-102. Later that afternoon, the installation at Surt (Sirte) fired additional SAMs at U.S. planes, but, like the first pair, went wide of their mark. About 14:30, a Libyan missile-equipped Combattante II G-type patrol craft sortied from Misratah, Libya, and approached &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; and her consorts. Two A-6E Intruders from &quot;America&quot;″s Attack Squadron 34 (VA 34) fired AGM-84 Harpoon missiles at the craft and sank her in the first use of the Harpoon in combat. Shortly afterwards, when American radars detected the Libyan installation at Sirte activating its target acquisition radars, two A-7 Corsairs from &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s VA-81 put the site out of action with AGM-88 HARMs (high-speed anti-radiation missiles).

One hour after the first patrol boat had sortied, a Soviet-built &quot;Nanuchka&quot;-type patrol craft began heading out into the Gulf of Sidra. Intruders from VA-34 and &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s VA-85 attacked with Rockeye cluster bombs, but the craft sought refuge alongside a neutral merchant ship, and avoided destruction. Damaged, she returned to the Port of Benghazi after nightfall.

The following day, at 02:00 25 March, another &quot;Nanuchka&quot;-II-type patrol boat entered International waters and came under attack from Intruders from VA-85 and &quot;Coral Sea&quot;″s VA-55; the former utilized Rockeyes in the attack, the latter then sank the craft with a Harpoon. The same squadrons then attacked and damaged a second &quot;Nanuchka&quot;-II, forcing her to put into Benghazi.

&quot;Attain Document III&quot; came to a close at 09:00 on 27 March, three days ahead of schedule and after 48 hours of largely unchallenged use of the Gulf of Sidra by the U.S. Navy. Thence steaming to Augusta Bay, Sicily, &quot;America&quot; relieved &quot;Saratoga&quot; on station, and subsequently visited Livorno, Italy, from 4–8 April 1986.

In the meantime, however, in the wake of the strikes designed to let Col. Qaddafi know that the United States had not only the desire but the capability to respond effectively to terrorism, intelligence information indicated that Qaddafi intended to retaliate.

===Libyan retaliation===
On 5 April 1986, two days after a bomb exploded on board a Trans World Airlines (TWA) flight en route to Athens from Rome, killing four U.S. citizens, a bomb exploded in the La Belle Discothèque in West Berlin, killing two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish civilian. Another 222 people were wounded in the bombing – 78 Americans among them. Colonel Qaddafi threatened to escalate the violence against Americans, civilian and military, throughout the world.

Repeated efforts by the United States to persuade the Libyan leader to forsake terrorism as an instrument of policy, including an attempt to persuade other western nations to isolate Libya peacefully, failed. Rumors of retaliation by the United States were soon followed by Qaddafi&#x27;s threat to take all foreigners in Libya hostage, to use them as a shield to protect his military installations. In light of that threat, and of the failure to gain peaceful sanctions against Libya, and citing &quot;incontrovertible evidence&quot; of Libyan complicity in the recent terrorist acts, President Reagan directed that attacks on terrorist-related targets in Libya be carried out.

===Operation El Dorado Canyon===
   &quot;See main article on Operation El Dorado Canyon&quot;

Operation &quot;El Dorado Canyon&quot; commenced early on the afternoon of 14 April 1986 around 1700 hours British Time as tanker aircraft took off from American RAF bases in England to support the US Air Force General Dynamics F-111F Aardvark and EF-111A Raven planes that soon followed them into the air from other American RAF bases. Thus began their trip to the target, flying around the Iberian Peninsula and through the Strait of Gibraltar, thereby avoiding over flight over France, Spain, and possibly Portugal. Later that afternoon, between 17:45 and 18:20 local time in the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;America&quot; launched six A-6 Intruder strike aircraft from VA-34 and six A-7E Corsair IIs (strike support); &quot;Coral Sea&quot; launched her strike/strike support aircraft, eight A-6Es from VA-55 and six F/A-18 Hornets between 17:50 and 18:20. Both carriers launched additional aircraft to support the strike to provide CAP and other functions.

&quot;In a spectacular feat of mission planning and execution&quot;, the Navy and Air Force planes, based apart, reached their targets on time at 19:00. The F-18 Hornets from &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and A-7 Corsair IIs from &quot;America&quot; launched air-to-surface Shrike and HARM missiles against Libyan SAM sites at Benghazi and Tripoli. Moments later, VA-34&#x27;s A-6E Intruders dropped their Mk. 82 bombs on the Benghazi military barracks, believed to be an alternate command and control facility for terrorist activities and a billeting area for Qaddafi&#x27;s elite Jamahiriya Guard, as well as a warehouse for components for MiG aircraft. VA-34&#x27;s attack heavily damaged the warehouse, destroying four crated MiGs and damaging a fifth.

Following that counter-terrorist strike, &quot;America&quot; visited Naples from 28 April – 4 May, and then participated in NATO exercise &quot;Distant Hammer&quot; with units of the Italian and Turkish Air Forces, and visited Nice/Monaco upon conclusion of the evolution. During June, the carrier operated with &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and the newly arrived , and took part in a &quot;poopdeck&quot; exercise with Spanish and United States Air Force units off the coast of Spain, arriving at Palma soon after.

Participating in a NATO exercise, &quot;Tridente&quot;, in late June, &quot;America&quot; visited Naples before she participated in a &quot;National Week&quot; exercise. Subsequently, visiting Catania and operating in the central and western Mediterranean, the carrier wound up the month of July at Benidorm, Spain, before returning to sea for further operations at sea in that region. Visiting Naples from 11 to 17 August, &quot;America&quot; spent the rest of her deployment in operations in the western and central Mediterranean before &quot;John F. Kennedy&quot; relieved her at Rota from 28 to 31 August. &quot;America&quot; arrived back at Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 20 November 1986 for an overhaul which lasted until 11 February 1988. She spent the remainder of that year operating along the East Coast and in the Caribbean.

&quot;America&quot; participated in Operation North Star during February and March 1989, an exercise to rehearse the Vestfjord operations planned to project power over the Kola peninsula against the Soviet Union. She was shadowed by a Soviet &quot;Slava-class&quot; cruiser, but shed her tail on departure from the fjord. She returned to Norfolk from the mini-deployment in April to prepare for her upcoming major deployment. &quot;America&quot; departed Norfolk 11 May 1989 for her sixteenth major deployment, to the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean. Her journey was not without incident. On 13 May 1989, a failed turnover of JP-5 pumproom monitors resulted in a fire and explosion, killing two crew members. The ship was briefly endangered, but after 7 hours of firefighting the situation was under control and normal operations resumed. On 11 August, &quot;Coral Sea&quot; and &quot;America&quot; departed early from separate port visits when they were diverted to the eastern Mediterranean as a show of force in the wake of the suspected hanging of Marine Corps LtCol William R. Higgins by Middle East terrorists, and threats to other hostages. LtCol Higgins had been kidnapped in February 1988 while a member of the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon. After operations in the Mediterranean, Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean, &quot;America&quot; returned home on 10 November 1989.

She later evacuated the American Embassy in Lebanon in 1989, and also went on a six-month deployment from May 1989 to November 1989 and served during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991. &quot;America&quot; also Participated in Operation Deny Flight in the mid-1990s.

==Persian Gulf War: Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm==

On 2 August 1990, the day &quot;America&quot; departed the Norfolk Naval Shipyard following a four-month Selected Restricted Availability, Iraq invaded Kuwait. As the international community geared toward possible military action against Iraq, &quot;America&quot; and CVW-1 rushed toward a much accelerated deployment schedule.

On 28 December, just over four months after her SRA and having completed a five-month training cycle into two months, &quot;America&quot; deployed to the Red Sea in support of Operation Desert Shield with Captain J. J. Mazach in command. At that time, the combined Command, Control, Communication, Cryptology, and Intelligence (C4I) package installed aboard &quot;America&quot; included systems such as the Navy Tactical Command System Afloat (NTCSA), the Contingency Tactical Action Planning System (CTAPS) and Advance Tracking Prototype. Although these systems were not unique to the fleet, it was the first time they had been integrated into one comprehensive package. Coupled with the disseminated capabilities of the Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS), &quot;America&quot;″s C4I package allowed intelligence and operations information to be meshed together into one single tactical picture. Utilizing digital data links between other ships, &quot;America&quot; had intelligence processing capabilities unparalleled by any other ship in the fleet. &quot;America&quot; also deployed with B57 and B61 nuclear weapons aboard.

On 9 January 1991, the &quot;America&quot; Battle Group transited the Strait of Gibraltar and sailed into the Mediterranean. Less than a week later, on 15–16 January, she passed through the Suez Canal and into the Red Sea on the UN-imposed deadline for Iraq&#x27;s unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. The &quot;America&quot; joined and battle groups to form Battle Force Red Sea. At 02:00 hours (Saudi time) on 17 January, Operation Desert Shield became Operation Desert Storm. &quot;America&quot;″s embarked airwing, CVW-1, initially provided Combat Air Patrol coverage over the battle force. On the second day of the war, &quot;America&quot; launched its first air strikes, targeting and destroying an ammunition depot north of Baghdad. In the next day&#x27;s darkness, CVW-1 flew its first night strike of the war against an oil production facility. Strikes of up to five hours into Iraq against bridges, mobile Scud sites, oil production facilities and Iraqi Republican Guard units continued for three weeks, when the focus of the air war changed. On 9 February Captain Kent W. Ewing took command of the great warship at an informal ceremony on the flight deck and newly selected
Rear Admiral Mazach departed under orders to his new assignment.

On 14 February, &quot;America&quot; entered the Persian Gulf to become the fourth carrier of Battle Force Zulu. Joining , and strikes were flown into the Kuwait Theater of Operations (KTO), with attacks on Iraqi military forces in Kuwait proper, as well as targets in eastern Iraq. This would make &quot;America&quot; the only carrier to operate on both sides of the Arabian Peninsula during Desert Storm. On 20 February, America&#x27;s VS-32 became the first S-3 squadron to engage, bomb and destroy a hostile vesselan Iraqi gunboat. On 23 February, aircraft from America destroyed a Silkworm (anti-ship) missile battery after Iraq unsuccessfully fired a missile at . The focus of the war changed again on 24 February with the beginning of the ground assault into Iraq and Kuwait. &quot;America&quot; aircraft provided air support for coalition troops by attacking Iraqi troop, tank and artillery sites in Kuwait, including the highway of death. One hundred hours later, Kuwait was successfully liberated and a cease-fire was ordered. CVW-1&#x27;s aircraft were credited with destroying close to 387 armored vehicles and tanks in the KTO.

&quot;America&quot; departed the Persian Gulf on 4 March, with CVW-1 having conducted 3,008 combat sorties, dropped over of ordnance and suffered no aircraft losses during the war. The Red Sea coastal town of Hurghada, Egypt would be &quot;America&quot;″s only port visit from 16 to 22 March, following 78 consecutive days at sea.

After passing through the Suez Canal and exiting the Mediterranean, &quot;America&quot; reached Norfolk on 18 April. She and CVW-1 earned a Navy Unit Commendation, a third for &quot;America&quot;, for service during Desert Storm. After a short stay at home, and participating in New York City&#x27;s Operation Welcome Home/Fleet Week festivities, &quot;America&quot; and CVW-1 once again headed for the Northern Atlantic to participate in NATO exercise &quot;North Star&quot;. Departing Norfolk in August for eight weeks, she became the first carrier to conduct flight operations within Havesfjord, Norway. Less than two months later, &quot;America&quot; departed on 2 December for her second deployment of the year. This uneventful six-month deployment would see &quot;America&quot; return to the Persian Gulf, and thus become the first carrier to redeploy to the region following the Gulf War. The entire Kuwaiti leadership and US Ambassador visited for a day to extend their praise and thanks for saving their country.

Exercises would also place her in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea, as well as the Mediterranean, before returning to Norfolk in June 1992.

==Final deployments==

&quot;America&quot; and her Joint Task Group departed Norfolk and other east Coast ports on 11 August 1993 for another major Mediterranean deployment to relieve &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; in Operation Deny Flight. After several weeks supporting United Nations peacekeeping efforts over Bosnia and Herzegovina, &quot;America&quot; transited the Suez on 29 October 1993 to relieve in the Indian Ocean in support of UN humanitarian efforts in Somalia. She was followed, on 1 November by members of her battle group, and the replenished oiler . &quot;America&quot; covered over in a week. Supporting the U.N humanitarian efforts in Somalia was the Naval Battle Force Somalia, commanded by Rear Adm. Arthur Cebrowski, Commander, Carrier Group 6 on &quot;America&quot;. Other elements of naval battle force Somalia include &quot;Simpson&quot;, amphibious vessels , , , and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit.

Before returning to the Mediterranean, CVW-1 aircraft flew missions into southern Iraq from the Red Sea in support of Operation Southern Watch. On 12 December 1993, &quot;America&quot; transited the Suez before returning to Norfolk in February 1994.

A unique operation developed 12 September 1994 due to the situation in Haiti. &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; and &quot;America&quot; deployed with a large contingent of Army helicopters on board, but no air wings. The carriers headed for the Caribbean in support of President Bill Clinton policy to restore democracy to Haiti. &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; also embarked Navy squadrons HS-7, HCS-4 and HC-2. This was the first time that carriers deployed operationally with a large contingent of Army helicopters and no air wing on board.

On 28 August 1995, &quot;America&quot; departed Norfolk on her 20th and final deployment in her 30-year history for anything but a routine six-month deployment to the Mediterranean, the Adriatic Sea and the Persian Gulf. She crossed the Atlantic Ocean in three days rather than the usual six-day transit through a Perfect Storm after leaving Norfolk. The carrier participated in Operation Deny Flight and Operation Deliberate Force, in association with the UN and NATO, and also flew missions in support of Operation Southern Watch over Iraq. &quot;America&quot; visited the capital city of Valletta, Malta, in January 1996 – the first U.S. Navy carrier to visit this historical port in over 24 years. &quot;America&quot;, operating from the Adriatic Sea, supported the NATO Implementation Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina for Operation Joint Endeavor before returning to Norfolk, Virginia on 24 February 1996.

===Decommissioning===
Originally scheduled to undergo a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) in 1996 for subsequent retirement in 2010, CV-66 fell victim to budget cuts and was instead retired early by the U.S. Navy.

She was decommissioned in a ceremony at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia on 9 August 1996. &quot;America&quot;″s final commanding officer was Capt. Robert E. Besal. The guest speaker for the ceremony was Adm. Leighton W. Smith, a former &quot;America&quot; commanding officer. Following the decommissioning, &quot;America&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and was transferred to the Ready Reserve Fleet at the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Though already decommissioned, she was awarded the 1995 Battenberg Cup in recognition of her crew&#x27;s achievements in her last full year in service.

==Post decommissioning service==
&quot;America&quot; was planned to be sold for scrapping. However, she was chosen to be a live-fire test and evaluation platform in 2005, to aid the design of future aircraft carriers. There was some objection to a ship being named &quot;America&quot; being deliberately sunk at sea, and a committee of her former crew members and other supporters attempted to save the ship for use as a museum ship. Their efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. In a letter to them, then-Vice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John B. Nathman explained:

On 25 February 2005, a ceremony to salute &quot;America&quot; and her crew was held at the ship&#x27;s pier in Philadelphia, sponsored by the USS America Carrier Veterans Association, Inc. and the America Museum Foundation, and attended by former crew members and various dignitaries. She departed the Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility on 19 April 2005 to conduct the aforementioned tests. The experiments lasted approximately four weeks. The Navy tested &quot;America&quot; with underwater explosives, watching from afar and through monitoring devices placed on the vessel. These explosions were designed to simulate underwater attacks.

After the completion of the tests, &quot;America&quot; was sunk in a controlled scuttling on 14 May 2005 at approximately 11:30, although the sinking was not publicized until six days later. At the time, no warship of that size had ever been sunk, and effects were closely monitored; theoretically, the tests would reveal data about how supercarriers respond to battle damage.

On 16 May 2005, Naval Sea Systems Command released the following statement:

===Scuttling location===
The U.S. Navy released the exact location where &quot;America&quot; was sunk: , around southeast of Cape Hatteras. The wreck lies upright in one piece below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean.
