<text>The Maumee River (pronounced ) (; ) is a river running in the United States Midwest from northeastern Indiana into northwestern Ohio and Lake Erie. It is formed at the confluence of the St. Joseph and St. Marys rivers, where Fort Wayne, Indiana has developed, and meanders northeastwardly for through an agricultural region of glacial moraines before flowing into the Maumee Bay of Lake Erie. The city of Toledo is located at the mouth of the Maumee. The Maumee was designated an Ohio State Scenic River on July 18, 1974. The Maumee watershed is Ohio&#x27;s breadbasket; it is two-thirds farmland, mostly corn and soybeans. It is the largest watershed of any of the rivers feeding the Great Lakes, and supplies five percent of Lake Erie&#x27;s water.

==History==


Historically the river was also known as the &quot;Miami&quot; in United States treaties with Native Americans. As early as 1671, French colonists called the river &#x27;Miami of the Lake&#x27; (in contrast to the &quot;Miami of the Ohio&quot; or the Great Miami River, called in the Miami-Illinois language). &quot;Maumee&quot; is an anglicized spelling of the Ottawa or Odawa name for the Miami tribe, . The Odawa had a village at the mouth of the Maumee River and occupied other territory in northwestern Ohio, including along its tributary, the Blanchard River.

The Battle of Fallen Timbers, the final battle of the Northwest Indian War, was fought north of the banks of the Maumee River. After this decisive victory for General Anthony Wayne, in 1795 Native Americans ceded a twelve-mile square tract around Perrysburg and Maumee to the United States by the Treaty of Greenville. They ceded additional lands, north of the river and downstream of Defiance, in the 1807 Treaty of Detroit. They ceded the remainder of the Maumee River valley in the 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs.

Prior to the development of canals, portages between the rivers were important trade routes. U.S. forces built forts such as Fort Loramie, Fort Recovery, and Fort Defiance along these routes. In honor of General Wayne&#x27;s victory on the banks of the Maumee, the primary bridge crossing the river near downtown Toledo is named the Anthony Wayne Suspension Bridge.

A dispute over control of part of the Maumee River region led to the so-called Toledo War between Ohio and the Michigan Territory.

Agricultural practices along the Maumee River have contributed in the 21st century to high phosphate levels in Lake Erie. This has triggered algae blooms in the lake. The drinking water from the city of Toledo was made unsafe for consumption for nearly a week in August 2014 because of such algae blooms.

==Natural history==

The Maumee River watershed was once part of the Great Black Swamp, a remnant of Glacial Lake Maumee, the proglacial ancestor of Lake Erie. The swamp was a vast network of forests, wetlands, and grasslands, a rich habitat for numerous species of birds, mammals, fish and flora. During the 19th century, European-American settlers struggled to drain the swamp and to convert the land to farmland; they dramatically altered the habitat, reducing areas where species could flourish.

==Transportation==
The mouth of the river at Toledo and Lake Erie is wide and supports considerable commercial traffic, including oil, grain, and coal. About upstream, in the town of Perrysburg, Ohio, the river becomes much shallower and today supports only recreational navigation above that point. The Miami and Erie Canal was built parallel to and north of the Maumee between Toledo and Defiance, Ohio, to enable extended transportation of shipped goods. The canal entered the river at a &quot;slackwater&quot; created by Independence Dam. It exited the river at Defiance and was built to the south, ending at Cincinnati, Ohio. While abandoned for commercial use, portions of the canal&#x27;s towpath are maintained for recreational use in both Lucas and Henry counties. A restored section of canal, including a canal lock, is operated at Providence Metropark, where visitors can ride an authentic canal boat.

The Wabash and Erie Canal was constructed on the south side of the river, continuing southwest from Defiance to Fort Wayne, Indiana, crossing the &quot;summit&quot; to the Wabash River valley (in Miami-Illinois the Wabash River was known as &quot;Waapaahšiki siipiiwi&quot;). Both canals were important pre-railway transportation methods in the 1840–60 period.

==Watershed==
The Maumee has the largest watershed of any Great Lakes river, with . This area includes a portion of southern Michigan. In addition to its source tributaries – the St. Joseph River (in Miami-Illinois: &quot;Kociihsasiipi&quot;) and St. Marys (in Miami-Illinois: &quot;Nameewa siipiiwi&quot;), the Maumee&#x27;s principal tributaries are the Auglaize River and the Tiffin River, which join it at Defiance from the south and north, respectively.

== Environmental Conditions ==

=== Great Lakes Area of Concern ===

Due to environmental contamination, a portion of the river was designated a Great Lakes Area of Concern (AOC) under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1987. The Maumee covers 8,316 square miles and has the largest drainage area of any Great Lakes river. The Maumee AOC is contained within 775 square miles of the river and includes several creeks. The environmental problems were caused by sediment contamination and agricultural runoff. The runoff caused large amounts of phosphorus to enter the river, eventually leading to manmade eutrophication in Lake Erie. Sediments at the site contained high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals, which came from old dumps, contaminated industrial sites, combined sewer overflows and disposal of dredged materials.

A 2006 remedial action plan for the AOC identified 10 &quot;beneficial use impairments&quot; caused by the pollution:

*Added costs to industry and agriculture, which was removed in 2015 due to no additional costs required to treat the water prior to agricultural and industrial use
*Restrictions on fish and wildlife consumption due to PCBs and heavy metals in sediments
*Eutrophication or undesirable algae, which causes persistent water quality problems, such as nuisance algal blooms, decreased water clarity and decrease of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters
*Degradation of fish and wildlife populations These levels are set based on what would be expected from the amount and quality of suitable physical, chemical and biological habitat present in the AOC.
*Beach closings due to the potential for high bacteria levels caused by combined sewer overflows
*Fish tumors or other deformities are caused by pollutants such as petroleum products and PCBs in the sediment and water.
*Degradation of aesthetics Materials and events that might cause this include oil slicks, surface scum, combined sewer overflows, excessive dust or algal blooms.
*Degradation of benthos, which was first documented in the 1950s and has been attributed to waste deposited old dumps, contaminated industrial sites, disposal of dredged materials and combined sewer overflows
*Restriction on dredging activities Contaminants in sediment can get stirred up and reintroduced to the water column during dredging activities, which remove sediment and debris from the bottom of a lake or river.
*Loss of fish and wildlife habitat Restoration actions include removing stream barriers, enhancing shoreline complexity, removing invasive species or restoring wetlands.

==Islands==
There are several small islands in the section of the Maumee River in northwest Ohio. The names of the islands are:

* Indian Island – near Farnsworth Park west of Toledo
* Woodcock Island – just west of Indian Island, adjacent to Missionary Island

==Walleye run==
According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, the annual walleye run up the Maumee River is one of the largest migrations of riverbound walleye east of the Mississippi. The migration of the walleye normally starts in early March and runs through the end of April. Although the first week of April is &quot;historically&quot; the peak of the migration, it varies according to environmental conditions. When river flows rise due to snow melt-off and the river water temperature reaches , the migration begins. Walleye come to spawn from the western end of Lake Erie and the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair in Michigan. The most popular method of fishing for the migrating walleye is by wading out into the river and casting.

<text>Admiral Charles William de la Poer Beresford, 1st Baron Beresford, (10 February 1846 – 6 September 1919), styled Lord Charles Beresford between 1859 and 1916, was a British admiral and Member of Parliament.

Beresford was the second son of John Beresford, 4th Marquess of Waterford, thus despite his courtesy title as the younger son of a Marquess, he was still eligible to enter the House of Commons. He combined the two careers of the navy and a member of parliament, making a reputation as a hero in battle and champion of the navy in the House of Commons. He was a well-known and popular figure who courted publicity, widely known to the British public as &quot;Charlie B&quot;. He was considered by many to be a personification of John Bull, indeed was normally accompanied by his trademark, a bulldog.

His later career was marked by a longstanding dispute with Admiral of the Fleet Sir John Fisher, over reforms championed by Fisher introducing new technology and sweeping away traditional practices. Fisher, slightly senior to Beresford and more successful, became a barrier to Beresford&#x27;s rise to the highest office in the navy. Beresford rose to occupy the most senior sea commands, the Mediterranean and Channel fleets, but failed in his ambition to become First Sea Lord.

== Family life and character ==
Beresford was born in Philipstown (Daingean) County Offaly and grew up in Curraghmore, Ireland, the second of five brothers. His older brother John joined the Life Guards, succeeding to the family estate and titles in 1866 on the death of their father. William joined the 9th Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers, was awarded the VC in the Anglo-Zulu War and became military secretary to several viceroys of India. Marcus joined the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars, became an equerry to King George V and in charge of the King&#x27;s racehorses. The youngest brother, Delaval, became a rancher in Canada.

The Beresfords traced their ancestry to an English officer serving in Ireland during the reign of James I. They subsequently married into the de la Poer family (Lady Catharine Power) who were of Norman origin and owned Curraghmore, hence their surname de la Poer Beresford. Their estate covered at Curraghmore near Waterford in south east Ireland, had stables for 100 horses and employed 600 people. The family enjoyed hunting, to the extent that his uncle was killed in a riding accident, his brother was crippled in another, and he himself managed ten broken bones at various times.

Beresford had a reputation for kindness to his men, saying &#x27;Any smart action performed by an officer or man should be appreciated publicly by signal...Everyone is grateful for appreciation&#x27;. At 46 and as captain, he took part in inter-ship rowing competitions.

He married Ellen Jeromina (Mina) Gardner, daughter of Richard Gardner and Lucy Mandesloh, on 25 June 1878 at London, England. They had two daughters, Eileen Teresa Lucy de la Poer Beresford (d. 1939) and Kathleen Mary de la Poer Beresford (1879–1939).

== Military and political career ==
Beresford had been captivated by the sight of the Channel Fleet at age twelve, and joined the Royal Navy in 1859 aged 13, following preparatory education at Stubbington House School. He started his training as a cadet at the naval training academy , successfully completing his passing-out examination in March 1861. He was immediately appointed a midshipman on the flagship of the Mediterranean fleet, the steam three-decker . Beresford described &quot;Marlborough&quot; as &quot;the smartest and happiest ship that ever floated&quot;. Beresford left &quot;Marlborough&quot; in early 1863, and was appointed to in the summer of 1863. &quot;Defence&quot; was one of four new ironclads serving in the Channel Squadron; Beresford was unhappy in &quot;Defence&quot;, which he described as &quot;a slovenly, unhandy tin kettle, which could not sail without steam...and which took minutes instead of seconds to cross topgallant yards&quot;. Beresford got into debt, his father consulted Admiral Eden, who arranged for Beresford&#x27;s transfer in mid-1864 to the steam-corvette , where Beresford would be the senior midshipman, which it was hoped would develop his sense of responsibility.

On 9 April 1865 &quot;Clio&quot; visited the Kingdom of Hawaii (then known as the Sandwich Islands) to escort Dowager Queen Emma to Panama for her visit to London. On the evening of 21 April Beresford and two other midshipmen pulled a prank and stole a wooden American eagle sign from the gate of the legation of United States Minister to Hawaii James McBride. Following the sign&#x27;s discovery by their superior officer Captain Nicolas Edward Brook Turnour and a formal diplomatic demand to return the sign by the American legation, they were ordered to apologize to the Americans, return and reinstall the sign the next day. The event was negatively reported in American newspapers including Harper&#x27;s Weekly. Beresford later claimed he did it because of a bet from a fair lady in Honolulu. It was in Honolulu where Beresford first met Nancy Wahinekapu Sumner, one of Queen Emma&#x27;s court ladies. Beresford and Sumner became friends, and continued their friendship through correspondence. Later in 1865, Beresford was transferred to the steam-corvette , which was commanded by Lord Gilford and was one of the smartest ships in the navy at the time. Beresford was promoted to acting sub-lieutenant in January 1866. A month later Beresford was transferred to the steam-frigate , the flagship of the Pacific Squadron. Beresford passed his seamanship examination to qualify for lieutenant on board &quot;Sutlej&quot;, which he left later in 1866. Beresford did a gunnery course on , a hulk in Portsmouth Harbour. Beresford broke a bone in his foot whilst dismounting a gun on &quot;Excellent&quot;, an injury that caused him pain for the rest of his life. Beresford joined still as a sub-lieutenant in 1867, and then in the summer of 1868 was one of the sub-lieutenants on the royal yacht &quot;Victoria and Albert&quot;. Beresford joined the steam-frigate , commanded by Queen Victoria&#x27;s son the Duke of Edinburgh, and toured the world, witnessed executions in Japan and got tattooed. On a visit to the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1869, Beresford met Nancy Sumner again. He proposed to her, but she refused likely due to their social and racial differences.

He entered Parliament as a Conservative in 1874, representing County Waterford and retained his seat until 1880. Some difficulties arose with the Lords of the Admiralty, who objected to a junior officer debating the navy publicly in the House of Commons. Beresford&#x27;s parliamentary career was saved by the intervention of the Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, who feared the loss of the seat to an opposition party, should Beresford be forced to resign. Whilst an MP he continued to serve in the navy, becoming a commander in 1875.

In 1874, Beresford was one of thirty-two aides chosen to accompany the Prince of Wales on a tour of India. Victoria objected, on the grounds of his bad reputation, but he remained at the Prince&#x27;s insistence. The tour was a lively mixture of social engagements and animal hunts. The Prince insisted on dressing for dinner, even in the jungle, but allowed the concession of cutting off the tails of their evening coats, creating the dinner jacket. He was aide-de-camp to the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, from 1875 until 1876. 

In 1891 Beresford&#x27;s affair with Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick (i.e., Frances Brooke) resulted in a serious dispute with the Prince of Wales. A letter written by the Countess to Beresford came into the possession of Beresford&#x27;s wife. She lodged the letter with solicitor George Lewis and threatened to use this to destroy the reputation of the Countess. The Prince of Wales, who had a special affection for the Countess, tried to have the letter destroyed but Lewis would not allow this. The Prince of Wales then took steps to exclude Lady Charles from his social circle. An angry Charles Beresford eventually extracted a written apology from the Prince. The Prince subsequently wrote to Lord Waterford (Beresford&#x27;s brother) saying that he &quot;can never forget, and shall never forgive, the conduct of your brother and his wife towards me&quot;

=== Involvement in Egypt and Sudan ===
From 1878 until 1881 Beresford was second in command of the royal yacht . He was captain of the gunboat in 1882 when it took part in the Bombardment of Alexandria during the Egyptian war of 1882 and won admiration amongst the British public for taking his ship inshore to bombard the Egyptian batteries at close range.

In 1884 and 1885 Beresford joined the staff of the Gordon Relief Expedition under Garnet Wolseley, along with the Naval Brigade and a Gardner machinegun, to which Beresford was much attracted. During the Battle of Abu Klea, Dervishes overran his Gardner gun when it jammed at the last moment. Beresford just escaped death by diving under the trail of the gun. Henry Newbolt&#x27;s Abu Klea poem &quot;Vitaï Lampada&quot; is often quoted, &quot;The Gatling&#x27;s jammed and the Colonel&#x27;s dead...&quot;, although it was a Gardner machine gun which jammed.

=== Re-election to Parliament, promotion to rear admiral ===
In 1885 he was again elected to Parliament, this time as MP for Marylebone East, and re-elected at the 1886 general election. Beresford constantly pushed for greater expenditure on the navy, resigning his seat in protest on this issue in 1889. Meanwhile, in 1886 he had also become Junior Naval Lord. The Naval Defence Act 1889, which increased naval spending, was passed partly as a result of public pressure resulting from this action.

Beresford was a believer in promoting physical recreation beyond the armed forces, being one of the founding committee of the National Physical Recreation Society which began in 1886 under the presidency of Herbert Gladstone. In 1888 he put down a motion in Parliament proposing that the County Councils (formed in 1889) provide a gymnasium for every 100,000 inhabitants. William Penny Brookes invited him to be president of the Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games in Shropshire for the years 1888 and 1889 but he was unable to be present at the sports, because of other commitments. In the latter year news of his affair with the Countess of Warwick broke after she threatened Lady Charles Beresford; despite this Brookes, an advocate of physical education, and Beresford had a warm correspondence from 1888 until Brookes&#x27; death in 1895, and Beresford was elected an honorary member of the Wenlock Olympian Society in 1891.

In July 1889, Beresford resigned from the House of Commons for the first of four times by being appointed Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds. ( only four other MPs had resigned by becoming stewards of both the Chiltern Hundreds and the Manor of Northstead.) From 1889 until 1893 he was the captain of , which was part of the Mediterranean Fleet.
In 1898 Beresford was promoted to rear-admiral and again entered Parliament, this time representing York, though he spent much of his time in China representing the Associated Chambers of Commerce. He spent 100 days in China, and on his return to London, spent 31 days writing &quot;The Break-Up of China&quot; (1899). He resigned from the House of Commons for a second time in January 1900, becoming Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds again, to become second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet, and left London to take up this position the following month. A dislike steadily developed between Beresford and Admiral Sir John Fisher, who was then commanding that fleet. Shortly after his arrival, Beresford took a company of men ashore and used them as stand-ins for ships to practice manoeuvring and assembling a fleet. Fisher noticed the display and publicly sent a signal demanding to know why Beresford had landed his men without permission. Lord Charles resented his superior as a social climber from unknown origins, while Fisher was jealous of Beresford&#x27;s inherited wealth and social position. In early February 1902 he left his position in the Mediterranean Fleet and returned to England.

=== As admiral ===

Beresford was again elected to Parliament in April 1902, this time for Woolwich, and in October that year visited New York City. He was promoted to vice-admiral on 3 October 1902, and in February 1903 resigned from the Commons for a third time (this time becoming Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead) when he was offered command of the Channel Fleet. He took up this position in April 1903 when he hoisted his flag on board . Later that year he was knighted in both the Order of the Bath and the Royal Victorian Order, followed by promotion to GCVO in 1906 and GCB in 1911. Beresford was in command of the Mediterranean Fleet from 1905 until 1907. David Beatty, then a captain serving under Beresford, commented that Beresford&#x27;s command of the fleet was characterised by &#x27;rigid training and discouragement of initiative&#x27;. Beresford aspired to reach the navy&#x27;s most senior post, First Sea Lord, but the position was held by Fisher, who was widely respected. Mandatory retirement at 65 would have led to Fisher departing in 1906, but Fisher&#x27;s promotion to admiral of the fleet also brought with it an extension of retirement age to 70. Beresford himself would reach retirement at 65 in 1911, unless he too could achieve the same promotion. As this seemed unlikely, the only possibility was if Fisher resigned, or was obliged to. Beresford set about organising a campaign criticising his handling of the navy and its reforms.

Beresford transferred to command of the Channel fleet from 1907 to 1909. He was complimented by a then-junior officer as having &#x27;no superior as a seaman&#x27;, but his time in charge was described as &#x27;principally a processional career around the ports of Britain ... I do not recall that any serious problems of war were either attempted or solved [but] Lord Charles received deputations, addressed crowded meetings in his honour, and became freeman of innumerable cities&#x27;.

Beresford is credited with recommending the use of Grimsby trawlers for minesweeping operations following visits he made to various East Coast ports in 1907. Grimsby, with its impressive docklands and trawler fleet was seen as ideal, with Beresford arguing that the fishing fleet would be inactive during times of war as fishing grounds became war zones. It was also thought that trawlermen would be more skilled than naval ratings with regards to the handling of the sizeable warps and winches that would be required for minesweeping as they were already accustomed to using them with the working of the trawl. In the First World War the boats provided the craft, the trawler fleet the crew, and the port a base for the Royal Naval Patrol Service.

It was noted that his personality seemed to have changed for the worse, and historians have suggested that he might have suffered a minor stroke at some time before 1907. In 1907 and 1908, there were two incidents involving Admiral Percy Scott, commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. In November 1907, Beresford ordered all ships of the Channel Fleet then at sea to return to harbour to be repainted for a review by the Kaiser. The armoured cruiser was engaged in gunnery practice at Portland, and its captain requested permission to finish the exercise before returning to harbour. Scott refused, signalling &quot;Paintwork appears to be more in demand than gunnery, so you had better come in in time to make yourself look pretty by the 8th&quot;. Nothing happened for four days, until a staff officer visiting Scott&#x27;s flagship heard of the signal and reported it to Beresford, who summoned and severely reprimanded Scott without giving Scott an opportunity to explain his remarks and actions, and refused to listen when Scott tried to offer an explanation. Beresford then asked the Admiralty to relieve Scott of his command, writing that Scott&#x27;s signal was &quot;totally opposed to loyalty and discipline...contemptuous in tone, insubordinate in character and wanting in dignity.&quot; The Admiralty did not comply, although they expressed their disapproval of Scott&#x27;s signal. In 1908, Scott disobeyed an order from Beresford which would have resulted in a collision.

After his term with the Channel Fleet finished in 1909, Beresford returned to Parliament at the January 1910 general election, representing Portsmouth. During his spell as commander of the Channel Fleet Beresford had become increasingly critical of Admiralty policy, in particular the organisational reforms instituted by Fisher. In April 1909, he wrote a letter to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister, expressing his discontent and threatening to express his concerns in public; Asquith responded by setting up a sub-committee of the Committee for Imperial Defence to report on the matter. This upheld Admiralty policy, but sufficient damage was done to Fisher&#x27;s reputation that he was obliged to retire slightly early, in 1910, in anticipation of a forthcoming general election.

In 1912, it was proposed by George V, who knew Beresford, that he might be promoted admiral of the fleet, but it fell to Beatty, now Naval Secretary to First Lord Winston Churchill to point out that others would be more deserving of such a promotion. He was later, in 1914, appointed an Honorary Colonel in the Royal Marines. Beresford had been somewhat left behind by the technological innovations and changes in the navy during the last years of his service as an admiral. It is likely that he would have performed poorly had he continued as an admiral into the First World War. However, at times during his career he supported proposals to reform the fleet signal book, which, it has been claimed, might have made it more suitable for wartime use, and had championed reforms in fire control, where understanding of how best to use the new big guns on Fisher&#x27;s dreadnought ships allegedly lagged behind their ability to hit at long ranges.

Fisher was succeeded as First Sea Lord in January 1910 by Sir Arthur Wilson, followed in 1911 by Sir Francis Bridgeman. Bridgeman proved to be unsatisfactory, and Churchill resolved to replace him with the Second Sea Lord, Prince Louis of Battenberg. Beresford questioned the matter of Bridgeman&#x27;s resignation, officially said to be for reasons of ill health, by challenging Churchill in the House of Commons. Churchill responded, saying of Beresford that &quot;since I became first lord of the admiralty...within a fortnight he made a speech in which he said I had betrayed the navy...and ever since he has been going about the country pouring out charges of espionage, favouritism, blackmail, fraud, and inefficiency... The noble Lord nourishes many bitter animosities on naval matters&quot;. The House of Commons supported Churchill, considering that Beresford&#x27;s attack was a continuation of his dispute with Fisher, who was now acting privately as advisor to Churchill.

On the eve of the First World War, First Lord Churchill and First Sea Lord Prince Louis of Battenberg made the crucial decision to cancel the scheduled dispersal of the British fleet following practice manoeuvres, to preserve the Royal Navy&#x27;s battle readiness. Nonetheless, with the outbreak of war, rising anti-German sentiment among the British public, newspapers, and elite gentlemen&#x27;s clubs (where resentment was inflamed by Beresford despite Churchill&#x27;s remonstrances) drove Churchill to ask Prince Louis to resign as on 27 October 1914, which Louis did amidst an outpouring of appreciation from politicians and his naval comrades.

Beresford remained an MP until 1916, after he retired from the navy in 1911. In January 1916, he resigned from the Commons for the fourth and final time, again becoming Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Beresford of Metemmeh and of Curraghmore in the County of Waterford. In October 1910, The Boy Scouts Association established a Sea Scout Branch and Beresford accepted the post of Chief Sea Scout. Together with Warington Baden-Powell, he devised the training scheme for the new section.

==Death and funeral==
Lord Beresford died in 1919 at Langwell, Berriedale, Caithness, at the age of 73, at which point his title became extinct. After a ceremonial funeral at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, he was buried at Putney Vale Cemetery, south London.

==Foreign honours==
Besides his peerage, Lord Beresford also held a number of foreign honours:
* Grand Cordon of the Order of the Medjidie of the Ottoman Empire.
* Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle of Prussia.
* Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer of Greece.
* Grand Cross of the Order of St Olav of Norway.
* Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour of France.

<doc id="391726" wikidata="Q922063" url="?curid=391726" title="International Plant Names Index">
<text>The International Plant Names Index (IPNI) describes itself as &quot;a database of the names and associated basic bibliographical details of seed plants, ferns and lycophytes.&quot; Coverage of plant names is best at the rank of species and genus. It includes basic bibliographical details associated with the names. Its goals include eliminating the need for repeated reference to primary sources for basic bibliographic information about plant names.

The IPNI also maintains a list of standardized author abbreviations. These were initially based on Brummitt &amp; Powell (1992), but new names and abbreviations are continually added.

==Description==
IPNI is the product of a collaboration between The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (Index Kewensis), The Harvard University Herbaria (Gray Herbarium Index), and the Australian National Herbarium (APNI). The IPNI database is a collection of the names registered by the three cooperating institutions and they work towards standardizing the information. The standard of author abbreviations recommended by the &quot;International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants&quot; is Brummitt and Powell&#x27;s &quot;Authors of Plant Names&quot;. A digital and continually updated list of authors and abbreviations can be consulted online at IPNI.

The IPNI provides names that have appeared in scholarly publications, with the objective of providing an index of published names rather than prescribing the accepted botanical nomenclature.

<doc id="391750" wikidata="Q310001" url="?curid=391750" title="Mp3PRO">
<text>mp3PRO is an unmaintained proprietary audio compression codec that combines the MP3 audio format with the spectral band replication (SBR) compression method. At the time it was developed it could reduce the size of a stereo MP3 by as much as 50% while maintaining the same relative quality. This works, fundamentally, by discarding the higher half of the frequency range and algorithmically replicating that information while decoding.

The technology behind SBR was developed by the former Swedish company Coding Technologies AB (acquired by Dolby Laboratories in 2007) in the late 1990s. It was included in their MPEG-2 AAC derived codec aacPlus, which would later be standardized as MPEG-4 HE-AAC. Thomson Multimedia (now Technicolor SA) licensed the technology and used it to extend the MP3 format, for which they held patents, hoping to also extend its profitable lifetime. This was released as mp3PRO in 2001.

It was originally claimed that mp3PRO files were compatible with existing MP3 decoders, and that the SBR data could simply be ignored. The reality was that MP3 players lacking specific mp3PRO decoding capability experienced a significant reduction in audio quality when playing mp3PRO files as only the lower half of the original frequency range is available.

mp3PRO development has been abandoned. The format was never standardized and there is no publicly available reference source code or documentation in existence. A very old software encoder/player exists, but is not maintained. Nero&#x27;s Soundtrax application, bundled in the Nero Multimedia Suite, is capable of encoding and decoding this format into several others. Some versions of the outdated MusicMatch Jukebox player (which will still run even on Windows 10 x64) were able to decode and encode this format, too. In the early 2000s, mp3PRO was usable in several portable music players and in popular music software, but its market share has deteriorated rapidly. The codec itself is largely surpassed in quality and efficiency, as well as device and application support, by modern codecs like AAC and its HE-AAC variants which employ the same SBR method.

==Thomson Demo mp3PRO Player==
Thomson Demo mp3PRO Player/Encoder is an unmaintained proprietary freeware media software program originally released by Thomson (now Technicolor SA) and Coding Technologies (acquired by Dolby Laboratories in 2007) which converts Waveform Audio File Format (WAV) files to mp3PRO.

The official website claims that nearly 50% more music, compared to standard MP3, can be held by a storage device whether CD, hard drive, or flash drive. The quality of 64 kbit/s mp3PRO technology is stated to be in the range between 96 and 128 kbit/s MP3.

This demo provides playback as well as compression capabilities. This specific demo program performs one WAV file to mp3PRO conversion at a time. Batch conversion is not available. Files must be 16bit PCM/WAV 44.1 kHz files.

The software, as well as the mp3PRO codec, has been unmaintained for more than a decade and is generally regarded as obsolete.

<text>Brigid&#x27;s cross or Brigit&#x27;s cross (Irish: &quot;Cros Bhríde&quot;, &quot;Crosóg Bhríde&quot; or &quot;Bogha Bhríde&quot;) is a small variant of the Christian cross often woven from straw or rushes. It appears in many different shapes; the earliest designs were simple Christian Latin or Greek crosses, but the most popular modern iteration features a woven diamond or lozenge in the centre. The cross is named for the Christian saint Brigid of Kildare.

Brigid&#x27;s cross is typically woven on 1 February, her feast day, as well as the festival of Imbolc in pre-Christian Ireland. Hanging Brigid&#x27;s cross from the rafters of one&#x27;s house was believed to bring the blessing and protection of the saint for the remainder of the year. The practice of crafting Brigid&#x27;s crosses is first attested in the 17th century and seems to have been in decline by the 20th century, in part due to house renovations that made hanging them difficult.

In addition to the shamrock and Celtic harp, Brigid&#x27;s cross is a national symbol of Ireland. From 1962 to 1995, it was incorporated into the Raidió Teilifís Éireann logo. A collection of Brigid&#x27;s crosses collected by the Irish Folklore Commission is on display at the National Museum of Ireland – Country Life.

== Design ==

Brigid&#x27;s crosses broadly refer to a type of cross woven out of straw or rushes. They are defined by building material more than appearance, and the exact shape of a Brigid&#x27;s cross varies greatly. The National Museum of Ireland has identified seven basic categories of cross: diamond, which is subdivided into single or multiple; &quot;swastika&quot; type, with four or three arms; wheel type; interlaced type; traditional Latin crosses made from straw or rush; bare wooden crosses in the Latin or Greek style which are bound with straw; and a final &quot;miscellaneous&quot; category.
The most popular of these is the diamond or lozenge cross, the dominant variant throughout Munster and Connacht. Two sticks are crossed over one another to provide a wooden framework for this cross, and at its centre, straw is woven into the shape of a diamond. Sometimes, additional woven diamonds are added to the four arms of the cross. Some historians have compared the lozenge shape at the centre of the diamond cross to that of the Mexican god&#x27;s eye or the Eurasian &quot;magic square&quot;.

Another popular variant is the &quot;swastika&quot; cross. Rather than being set parallel to one another like a traditional cross, the arms of the swastika cross are set at right angles from a lozenge or diamond at the centre. These offset angles evoke the image of a wheel in motion and may have originally represented the sun, or &quot;the great wheel in the sky&quot;. In certain regions of Ulster, this wheel spinning in a circle imagery is evoked with a three-armed woven cross. This three-armed variant has been compared to the triskelion, a popular motif in Celtic imagery. In rare cases, Brigid&#x27;s cross may be set fully inside a circle; this is known as a &quot;wheel cross&quot; or &quot;St. Brigid&#x27;s Bow&quot;.

Unlike other Brigid&#x27;s crosses, which were typically made of straw, the interlaced cross is often made of rushes. Unlike other forms of the cross which contain a woven shape in the centre, the interlaced cross consists only of rush or straw strands woven into a Christian cross shape. While straw is the more popular weaving material for most variants of Brigid&#x27;s cross, the interlaced cross is more frequently made from rushes. An even simpler variant is the bare cross, which consists either of two bound plaits of straw or of two planks of wood bound together in the centre by straw. Occasionally, no straw is used at all: the Sheaf-Cross, located in eastern County Galway and County Roscommon, involves two small sheathes of unthreshed corn are bound together by a split thatching branch.

== Folklore ==
Brigid&#x27;s cross is named for Brigid of Kildare, the only female patron saint of Ireland, who was born in Leinster. Unlike her contemporary, Saint Patrick, Brigid left no historical record, and most information about her life and work derives from a hagiography written by the monk Cogitosus some 200 years after her birth. The prevailing Christian folklore surrounding Brigid&#x27;s cross involves the deathbed conversion of an Irish pagan chieftain, in some stories her father. While telling the pagan about the Crucifixion of Jesus, Brigid collected rushes from the ground and wove them into a cross, after which the chieftain requested a Christian baptism. In another story, Brigid was given a poisoned drink by a woman of ill intent, and she wove the cross to neutralise the toxins.

== Ritual use ==

One of the customs associated with Brigid of Kildare&#x27;s feast day was to hang Brigid&#x27;s crosses in the rafters or over entryways of buildings, thus invoking the saint&#x27;s blessing and protection for the remainder of the year. Families would gather rushes on 31 January, the eve of Brigid&#x27;s feast day. After an evening feast, the head of household would supervise the rest of the family as they wove crosses from the collected material. These crosses were left out overnight to receive Brigid&#x27;s blessing, and on 1 February, crosses would be mounted in the main dwelling place, outhouses, and stables. While the direction in which the crosses were hung remains unknown, that the centre shape is frequently described as a lozenge rather than a square suggests that Brigid&#x27;s cross is properly displayed in a saltire style rather than that of the Latin cross. Crosses were either taken down annually and replaced, or they accumulated between feasts. If they were discarded, they were burned or buried, with the latter preferred due to Brigid&#x27;s associations with agriculture.

The weaving of Brigid&#x27;s crosses was popular throughout Ireland, particularly in the north and midland, but its popularity dwindled during the 20th century. Some families attributed the decline of Brigid&#x27;s crosses to house renovations that inhibited the ability to hang them appropriately. Outside of Ireland, Brigid&#x27;s crosses are also customarily hung in Glastonbury, England, in accordance with a local legend that says Brigid of Kildare visited the town in 488 CE. Families may also send woven crosses to their friends and relatives who live abroad, or they will carry a cross with them when they leave Ireland. The weaving of crosses was not restricted to Brigid&#x27;s feast day: friends would often gift crosses to incur blessings and strengthen their bond, while newlywed couples would often receive &quot;womb crosses&quot; to hang above their door, as Brigid was also a patron of fertility.

Although they take place at different points of the season, the weaving of Brigid&#x27;s cross is associated with other rituals in which the last sheaf of that year&#x27;s harvest is woven into intricate shape. In County Armagh, for instance, the harvest season involves the weaving of Harvest Knots and Harvest Stars, the former of which involves a lozenge shape similar to that of Brigid&#x27;s cross. These &quot;last sheaf&quot; celebrations are collectively known as the &quot;Cailleach&quot;.

== As a national symbol ==

Shortly after the Irish Free State gained its independence in 1922, Brigid&#x27;s cross became one of several nationalist symbols, alongside such other motifs as the shamrock and Celtic harp, used by Irish artists in order to create a national cultural identity separate from that of Britain. In the 1950s, Brigid&#x27;s cross was incorporated into the logo of the Irish Department of Health, and as of 2024, the cross remained a part of the logo of the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, who frequently incorporate Brigid into their imagery for her associations with midwifery.

Brigid&#x27;s cross was selected as the first station identification marker for Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) in 1962, with Alice Curtayne writing that the cross was selected to evoke &quot;the image of quiet, serene places in the springtime of our history, of rush-bordered rivers in a serene arcadian landscape&quot;. The RTÉ logo underwent nine redesigns between 1962 and 1987, with the cross taking varying levels of prominence compared to the station name. It was removed from the RTÉ logo in 1995 in favour of &quot;a clean striking piece of modern design&quot;, a decision which Carol Coulter of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; opined, &quot;Saint Brigid&#x27;s cross has lost its place as a symbol of our national identity, well at least as far as our national broadcasting station is concerned.&quot;

In 1942, the Irish Folklore Commission created a questionnaire regarding the Feast of Saint Brigid, during which they collected several hundred Brigid&#x27;s crosses. In 2022, the Commission selected a sample of 21 of these crosses to be displayed at the National Museum of Ireland – Country Life in Castlebar. The display coincided with an announcement from the Irish government that 1 February would be declared a national holiday.

<doc id="391792" wikidata="Q685857" url="?curid=391792" title="Medgidia">
<text>Medgidia ( ; historical Turkish names: &quot;Karasu&quot; or &quot;Carasu&quot;, &quot;Mecidiye&quot; or &quot;Megidie&quot;) is a city in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, south-eastern Romania.

==History==
Archaeological findings show that Dobruja was inhabited since the Neolithic period. Starting with 46 BC the region was administered by the Roman Empire. A castrum was built in the Carasu Valley, becoming the cradle of the settlement.

In 1417, the Turks invaded Dobruja. From the 15th century onwards, the region started to be colonized with a Muslim population. The settlement named &quot;Karasu&quot; (Turkish for &quot;Black Water&quot;) was mentioned on the map of Iehuda ben Zara in 1497, in the notes of Paolo Giorgio (1590) and Evliya Çelebi (1653).

Modern Medgidia was built by the Ottoman administration on the place of the old Karasu beginning with 1856. It was built as a planned city to accommodate refugees from the Crimean War and to serve as an economic hub for the central zone of Dobruja. The town was named in honour of the sultan Abdülmecid I, the Ottoman sovereign of the period.

After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, Northern Dobruja became part of Romania. Medgidia was the last capital of Silistra Nouă County (1878–1879) before it was merged into Constanța County.

==Geography==
Medgidia is located between the Danube and the Black Sea, away from Constanța. The city is crossed by the Danube–Black Sea Canal west to east; the river Medgidia discharges into the Canal in Remus Opreanu village.

The general aspect of the relief is that of a low plateau with a limestone structure, covered with thick deposits of loess. The natural resources in the area consist of limestone deposits and kaolin sand. The limestone structure of the earth permits a natural filtering of the groundwater.

==Climate==
The climate is temperate-continental, with short and cold winters and very hot summers.

==Local administration==
Medgidia became a municipality in 1994.

The town infrastructure is continuously developing and offers the inhabitants 4 high schools, 8 primary schools, 12 nurseries, 4 cultural centers with a hall for cultural activities, 2 show and cinema halls, 3 clubs and 5 libraries, a 30,000-seat stadium, a sports hall, and a swimming pool. Medgidia also houses a 500-bed hospital.

The following villages are administered by the municipality:
* Remus Opreanu (historical name: &quot;Alibei-Ceair&quot;, ) – renamed after Remus Opreanu, the first Romanian prefect of Constanța County (1878–1881)
* Valea Dacilor (historical name: &quot;Endecarachioi&quot;, or &quot;Hendek Kara Kuyusu&quot;)

=== Politics ===
The current mayor of Medgidia is (PNL). The Medgidia Municipal Council, elected in the 2024 local government elections, consists of 18 councillors. The National Liberal Party holds 10 seats, the Social Democratic Party holds 5 seats, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians holds 2 seats, and one seat is held by the S.O.S. Romania party.

==Economy==

The economic landscape spotlights the existence of a town fully involved in its progress. Out of 1,200 registered enterprises, only 30 are state-owned and 15 are joint ventures.

Beside the agricultural activities (milk-processing, milling, bakery and wine growing), the main industry deals in cement and building materials, agricultural machinery and forging equipment, wood processing and furniture factories.

Medgidia lies in the center of an agricultural area of several tens of millions hectares, with a fertile soil and provided with irrigation systems.

The area offers:
* a rich agricultural tradition and trained specialists
* a road network for the transport of goods
* relatively short transport distances, especially through the port
* access to other Romanian or European regions
* better climate conditions than in other parts of Romania (winter is shorter)
* an outstanding irrigation potential

The Medgidia clinker storage facility was completed in 2009 and is the world&#x27;s largest dome-type cement clinker storage facility.

The Romanian Air Force operates a WSR-98D radar station in Medgidia. The facility is officially designated and operated as a civilian radar station by the National Meteorological Administration, however the data is fed into the NATO Integrated Air Defense System as well.

==Transport==

The town is a road and rail node and an inland port to the Danube–Black Sea Canal. The Canal crosses the town for about of its length.

The Danube–Black Sea Canal has a capacity of 11.2 million tons/year and can admit ships of . Provided with road and rail links, the harbor offers storage facilities and cranes able to lift up to 16-ton weights. Beside a SNCFR marshaling yard, along the Canal there is a Free Trade Area in course of being finalized.

The A2 highway from Bucharest to Constanța, partially financed by the European Union, bypasses the town, allowing the development of associated services (hotels, petrol stations and a parking yard for trucks) in the area.
Also, the Medgidia train station is an important node on the CNCFR Main Line 800. The station provides rail service to several towns and cities, including Constanța (35 km), Tulcea (144 km), and București Nord (199 km).

==Landmarks==

===The Art Museum &quot;Lucian Grigorescu&quot;===
It was opened in 1964 with exhibitions of Romanian contemporary painting, sculpture, and graphics, signed Lucian Grigorescu, Marius Bunescu, Ion Jalea, and others. The permanent exhibition takes in classic and modern artworks but also works of contemporary art classics, including Lucian Grigorescu, Nicolae Tonitza, Francisc Șirato, Ștefan Dimitrescu, and Iosif Iser. The museum also displays a collection of ceramic artworks.

In 1991 the museum was named after Lucian Grigorescu, a town native, who was deemed as the most Latin among the Romanian painters. The city honors the painter every year on 1 February, the anniversary of his birthday.

Because of low income due to few visitors and high maintenance costs, the museum was closed in 2009.

===The &quot;Abdul Mejid&quot; Mosque===

Built in 1860 by the Ottoman Government, the mosque is an historic and architectural monument. It was named after the sultan Abdulmejid I, who reigned between 1839 and 1861.

The mosque is served by an imam and a muezzin. The building respects the traditional form of the Muslim cultural placements, decorated in the interior with oriental ornaments and inscriptions in Arabic.

===The &quot;Saints Peter and Paul&quot; Orthodox church===
The church was built in a Roman-Greek style and it was raised with the contribution of the local Christians on the ruins of a Roman castrum.

===The Serbian Heroes&#x27; Monument===
In 1926, Medgidia commemorated the heroism of the First Serbian Volunteer Division, which fought in Dobruja during World War I as a part of the bloody Romanian theatre, by inaugurating a monument in the group&#x27;s honor. The completed memorial, featuring an iconic white marble pyramid, was the setting of a ceremony held with the participation of both Romanian and Yugoslavian officials. Wreaths were laid at the base of the monument by members of the Serbian and Romanian royal families.

<doc id="391793" wikidata="Q7488920" url="?curid=391793" title="Shannon Noll">
<text>Shannon Noll (born 16 September 1975) is an Australian singer-songwriter who first came to prominence as runner-up of the first season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in 2003, which led to him being signed to Sony BMG. He has released five top-ten albums, including two number-one multi-platinum sellers. Noll&#x27;s first ten singles all peaked inside the ARIA top ten, including three that reached number one. He is the only Australian male artist in Australian chart history to have ten consecutive top-ten singles. Noll&#x27;s debut single, &quot;What About Me?&quot;, was certified 4× platinum and became the highest-selling single of 2004 in Australia.

With 17 platinum and three gold certifications and combined album and single sales of over 1.3 million in Australia, Noll has the third-highest certification and sales level for an &quot;Australian Idol&quot; contestant. Noll has received six ARIA Music Award nominations, including Best Pop Release for his second album &quot;Lift&quot;, and has won five ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards. He also won the MTV Australia Video Music Award for Best Male Artist three years in succession between 2005 and 2007. In 2010, Noll ended his contract with Sony, briefly signed with Universal Music Australia before signing with Warner Music Australia, to release his fifth studio album &quot;Unbroken&quot; in February 2018.

In January 2018, he was revealed as a celebrity contestant on the fourth season of the Australian version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, and in August 2022, he was revealed to be the &quot;Blowfly&quot; on the fourth season of Network 10&#x27;s &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot;.

== Early life ==
Noll was born on 16 September 1975 in Orange, New South Wales, to Neil and Sharyn Noll. He grew up in the small town of Tullibigeal in central western New South Wales as the youngest of three children with his older brothers Adam and Damian. Noll spent his entire childhood and teenage years on the family farm, which raised sheep and cattle and grew cereal crops. At school, he enjoyed drama classes and performed in school productions. After leaving school, he traveled to Sydney where he met his wife Rochelle Ogston and played AFL. As an adult, Noll worked shearing sheep among other tasks. He and his brothers formed the band called Cypress (named after the Cypress pine timber mill where they rehearsed). He provided vocals and played guitar. In gigs around the Australian outback, the band played in country pubs. Although they performed mainly covers, the group also wrote original music. Noll&#x27;s father Neil was killed during a farming accident in 2001, which left the farm to him and his brothers. After two years of extreme drought, Noll leased the farm out and got by on drought support money and odd-jobbing on a friend&#x27;s farm. He penned a song on his album &quot;Lift&quot; titled &quot;Now I Run&quot; in his father&#x27;s memory.

==Career==
===2003–2004: &quot;Australian Idol&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Talking About&quot;===
In 2003, Noll successfully auditioned for the first season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, singing Southern Sons&#x27; &quot;Hold Me in Your Arms&quot;. His audition impressed all three judges, including Marcia Hines who told him that she had just discovered &quot;a voice&quot; and Ian Dickson who informed Noll that &quot;Australia will love you&quot;. Following the semi-final process, Noll had advanced through to the top twelve. He eventually progressed through to the grand final with Guy Sebastian, following contestant Cosima De Vito&#x27;s withdrawal from the competition. The grand final was held on 19 November 2003 at the Sydney Opera House. After the viewer votes had been tallied it was announced that Guy Sebastian was the winner.

Shortly after &quot;Idol&quot; Noll signed a five-album deal with BMG Australia, which later merged with Sony. He then embarked on the &quot;Australian Idol&quot; national tour in January 2004, with eleven other contestants from the top twelve. That same month Noll released his cover of the Moving Pictures song &quot;What About Me?&quot; as his debut single. It debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart and spent four consecutive weeks at the top spot. &quot;What About Me&quot; was the highest-selling single of 2004 in Australia and was certified 4× platinum for shipments of 280,000 copies. The song also reached number two in Ireland and number ten in New Zealand. Noll&#x27;s debut album &quot;That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Talking About&quot; was released on 9 February 2004, and debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart with first-week sales of 131,680 copies. Containing a mixture of pop, rock and country tracks, the album spent fourteen weeks in the top ten, including four weeks at number one, and was certified 5× platinum for shipments of 350,000 copies.

The second single &quot;Drive&quot;, an uptempo rock track written by Canadian singer Bryan Adams, reached number four in Australia and was certified platinum for shipments of 70,000 copies. Noll&#x27;s cover of boy band A1&#x27;s &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; was released as the third and final single from &quot;That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Talking About&quot;. It became his second number one single and was certified gold for shipments of 35,000 copies. Noll received two nominations at the 2004 ARIA Music Awards, including Highest Selling Single for &quot;What About Me&quot; and Highest Selling Album for &quot;That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Talking About&quot;. He embarked on his first solo headlining tour titled The Overdrive Tour in April 2004 to promote the album. In August 2004 Noll starred in a TV special on Network Ten titled &quot;Up Close with Shannon Noll&quot;, which was hosted by Ian Dickson. By late 2004 the Nine Network had approached Noll to re-record the Australian cricket anthem &quot;C&#x27;mon Aussie C&#x27;mon&quot; with updated lyrics. His version peaked at number two and was certified platinum. All proceeds from the single went towards Red Cross&#x27; Good Start Breakfast Club, a community initiative set up to ensure all Australian school children start the day with a healthy breakfast.

=== 2005–2006: &quot;Lift&quot; ===
In early 2005, Noll went on a songwriting trip to the United States and the United Kingdom to work on his second album with Desmond Child, Dianne Warren and Wayne Hector. He later decided not to use any of the material he wrote with Child and also passed on a song by Warren because he preferred his work with local Australian songwriters. Throughout February and March 2005, Noll opened for Bryan Adams on the Australian leg of his Room Service Tour. His second album &quot;Lift&quot; was released on 16 October 2005, and debuted at number one. The album, with 11 out of 13 tracks co-written by Noll, covered topics including finding love, death, overcoming odds and self belief. It spent nine weeks in the top ten and was certified 3× platinum for shipments of 210,000 copies. The lead single &quot;Shine&quot; also debuted at number one and was certified platinum. The album&#x27;s title track and second single &quot;Lift&quot; peaked at number 10 and was certified gold. It was later chosen as the theme song for the Australian version of reality series &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;. Two further singles were released from the album, &quot;Now I Run&quot; which peaked at number six and &quot;Lonely&quot; which peaked at number eight. Noll received two nominations at the 2006 ARIA Music Awards, including Highest Selling Single for &quot;Shine&quot; and Best Pop Release for &quot;Lift&quot;. He embarked on his second solo headlining tour titled the Lift Tour in January 2006 to promote the album.

Noll was set to star in the film &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;, based loosely on the life of Australian racer Peter Brock, but he declined the offer. In September 2006 Noll dropped Sydney firm Caplice Management and signed with New York-based management group Worldwide Entertainment Group (WEG). The decision was seen as part of his effort to gain success in the US, after having previously put on showcase performances for music industry executives with no luck. He supported American rock band Live on their Australian tour the following month. In December 2006 Noll and Natalie Bassingthwaighte released a cover of the Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush duet &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; which peaked at number two and was certified platinum, after spending eleven consecutive weeks in the top ten. It served as the lead single from the compilation album &quot;&quot;, which was released to raise funds for beyondblue&#x27;s depression research activities. &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; earned Noll a nomination for Highest Selling Single at the ARIA Music Awards the following year.

=== 2007–2009: &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, &quot;No Turning Back: The Story So Far&quot; and &quot;What Matters the Most&quot;===
In September 2007, Noll made his theatrical debut as Parson Nathaniel in the Australian tour of the stage musical &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;. His third album, &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, was released on 15 September 2007; it debuted at number three and was certified platinum. Noll had travelled to the US earlier that year to work on the album with several songwriters and producers, including Richard Marx, Luke Ebbin and Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora. The anthemic rock tune &quot;Loud&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Turn It Up&quot; and debuted at number three. The second single &quot;In Pieces&quot; reached number 26, while the third single &quot;Everybody Needs a Little Help&quot; did not chart. Noll embarked on his third solo headlining tour, titled the Turn It Up Tour, in June 2008 to promote the album.

Noll was honoured in an episode of the Australian version of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. His first compilation album &quot;No Turning Back: The Story So Far&quot; was released on 27 September 2008, and debuted at number seven. The album included ten of Noll&#x27;s hit singles and five new tracks. His cover of the Brian Melo song &quot;Summertime&quot; was released as the only single from the album and peaked at number 54. He embarked on his No Turning Back Tour to promote the album&#x27;s release. In June 2009, Noll again appeared as Parson Nathaniel in the UK tour of &quot;Jeff Wayne&#x27;s Musical Version of The War of the Worlds&quot;. Noll&#x27;s second compilation album &quot;What Matters the Most&quot;, featuring songs from his previous albums, was released in the UK to coincide with the tour but it did not chart. Two of his previous singles, &quot;Shine&quot; and &quot;Now I Run&quot;, were re-released to accompany the album&#x27;s UK release. He returned to Australia the following month for his acoustic In the Raw Tour, which featured a special Q&amp;A session with host Nick Bennett.

=== 2010–2014: &quot;A Million Suns&quot;===

In January 2010, Noll announced that he had parted ways with Sony, adding that it was time for a fresh start elsewhere. He later signed with Universal Music Australia and released his fourth album &quot;A Million Suns&quot; on 14 October 2011 which debuted at number eight. The lead single &quot;Switch Me On&quot; was co-written by Benji Madden of Good Charlotte, and its music video was filmed in Tokyo. &quot;Switch Me On&quot; reached number 42 and was certified gold. Three further singles &quot;My Place in the Line&quot;, &quot;Living in Stereo&quot; and &quot;Rewind&quot; all failed to chart. Noll embarked on his A Million Suns Tour in 2012 to promote the album. In April 2012, Noll became a contestant on the twelfth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars Australia&quot; and was partnered with professional dancer Elena Samodanova. He was forced to withdraw from the competition the following month after suffering a severe spinal injury while rehearsing a lift with Samodanova.

Noll released the single &quot;Man I Can Trust&quot; on 1 October 2012 to coincide with the release of his autobiography &quot;Shannon Noll: So Far&quot;, which he wrote with Sydney writer Alan Whiticker. The book explores Noll&#x27;s early days on the family farm, the pain his family suffered following his father&#x27;s death, his depression and drug usage, as well as the battles he waged against his critics and the music industry. From November 2012 to February 2013, Noll embarked on his In My Youth Tour which featured him performing acoustic covers of songs from the &#x27;80s that were chosen by his fans. In late 2013 Noll became the featured promoter of South Australian retailer Radio Rentals and its sister brand RT Edwards in Queensland. The commercials for Radio Rentals and RT Edwards featured Noll singing the Roy Orbison hit &quot;You Got It&quot;. He embarked on his Invincible Tour in February 2014 and performed a mixture of old and new songs. Noll released &quot;We Only Live Once&quot; in July 2014 as the lead single from his next album, but it did not chart. The single&#x27;s music video featured an appearance by Miss Universe finalist Renae Ayris. Noll embarked on his We Only Live Once Tour in September 2014 to support the single&#x27;s release.

=== 2016–present: &quot;Unbroken&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot;===
On 30 September 2016, Noll released the single &quot;Who I Am&quot;, from his forthcoming fifth studio album. On 5 May 2017, Noll released the single &quot;Southern Sky&quot; This was followed by the release of a video and announcement of a national tour on 9 May.
On 4 December, Noll and his record label Warner Music announced his fifth studio album is titled &quot;Unbroken&quot; and was released in Australia on 2 February 2018. In January 2018, Noll competed in the fourth season of the Australian &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. He was announced as runner-up on the show&#x27;s finale on 12 March 2018.

On 4 November 2019, Noll released a song titled &quot;Long Live the Summer&quot;, which was the lead single for his forthcoming sixth studio album. He then went on to release a track called &quot;Wonderful&quot;, on 20 November 2020, which was featured as the second single for the album. In 2020, Noll toured across New South Wales and performed over 30 intimate and acoustic shows. Following this successful run of shows, fans requested an album based on these shows. The album includes the first song written entirely by Noll. The third and final single of the album was a song titled &quot;Better&quot;, which was released on 23 April 2021. Noll&#x27;s sixth studio album, titled &quot;Raw&quot;, was officially released on 28 May 2021 and was supported by the &quot;Raw &amp; Uncovered&quot; Australian tour. Upon release, Noll said the album &quot;features some new songs plus new recordings of many of the songs you love hearing at my live shows plus covers of some Aussie classics.&quot; &quot;Raw&quot; debuted at number 3 on the ARIA Charts, becoming his sixth consecutive top ten studio album. At the end of the year, the album was positioned at number 49 on the ARIA Year End Charts for Australian Country Albums.

In August 2022, Noll was revealed to be blowfly on the fourth season of Network 10&#x27;s &quot;The Masked Singer Australia&quot;, where he placed fifth overall. On 23 August, he released his first song for 2022, a non-album single titled &quot;Take Me Away&quot;. In September 2022, he released two remixed versions of his 2004 hit song &quot;What About Me&quot;. In Early 2023, Noll released a podcast titled &quot;Idol Talking With Nollsie&quot;, to coincide with the return of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, which had been picked up by the Seven Network. In April 2023, he released another single titled &quot;Believe It&quot;, which was his first release of that year, and revealed that he was working on his seventh studio album.

== Charity ==
Noll has to date donated well over $1 million to various charities throughout Australia. Most notably he donated the earnings from two of his platinum singles, &quot;C&#x27;mon Aussie C&#x27;mon&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;. Noll additionally makes appearances and personally raises funds for charities.

Noll regularly appears in fundraisers for Movember, a foundation that supports research into testicular cancer.

==Legacy==
Noll has become a popular Internet meme, particularly in Australia. The popular phrase &quot;Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 &quot;Australian Idol&quot; title&quot; gained popularity in 2015, with multiple Facebook pages appearing featuring the phrase. Noll acknowledged the internet fame, finding it &quot;very funny&quot; and stating, &quot;Some of the stuff they&#x27;ve done is bloody brilliant and very clever and very funny. I reckon half of the kids putting together these memes need to be on my marketing team!&quot; In January 2016, a Facebook page was created titled &quot;Get Shannon Noll to Groovin&#x27; the Moo 2016&quot;. Despite the page&#x27;s thousands of likes, the organisers of Groovin&#x27; the Moo did not reach out to the artist to perform. In June 2016, the &#x27;GATchphrase&#x27; for the 2016 GAT (a theme chosen by the VCE students of Victoria to write into their papers to show group protest) was voted to be &quot;Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title&quot;. An estimated 3,600 took part in this event.

==Personal life==
Noll married his long-time girlfriend Rochelle Ogston at St Peter&#x27;s Church in Cremorne, New South Wales, on 2 October 2004. They have three sons and a daughter.

==Legal issues==
In December 2004, Noll was caught driving drunk in his home town of Condobolin. He promptly admitted that it was a &quot;stupid mistake&quot;. On 5 April 2005, Noll pleaded guilty in court to driving with a blood alcohol reading of 0.11. The magistrate disqualified him from driving for nine months, fined him $1,000, and ordered him to pay court costs.

On 15 January 2017, Noll was arrested for assaulting a bouncer at an Adelaide strip club. He was charged with two counts of assault and was scheduled to appear at the Adelaide magistrates court in February 2017.
The charges were dropped during a brief court hearing on 6 April 2017.

In July 2018 during a gig at the Duck Creek Picnic Races in Nyngan, New South Wales, Noll launched an almost two-minute tirade at a crowd member who threw a can of beer on stage, receiving appreciative support from the crowd. A video of the incident recorded on a phone, in which Noll angrily responds to the beer can incident with an outburst including &quot;Fucking private school, stupid fucking motherfucker... Have some balls and come up here and I&#x27;ll punch your fucking teeth down your throat out the back, dog-arse prick. Then I&#x27;ll fuck your missus and your mum,&quot; went viral. Noll later apologised on Facebook, writing: &quot;I completely understand that that is still no excuse for the way I spoke and I am deeply sorry for the terrible things I said that were purely out of frustration.&quot; Noll was dropped from a Queensland Rodeo as a result of the outburst. The crowd&#x27;s reaction during the incident, appearing to goad Noll into threats of violence was widely reported as disturbing. In his apology, Noll blamed his outburst on one of his band previously getting hurt when a firecracker was thrown on stage, and the large number of beer cans being thrown at the band.

On 13 September 2018, Noll was charged after NSW police allegedly found him with a bag of &quot;white powder&quot; while searching the premises of the Caringbah Hotel, Caringbah.
On 11 October 2018, Noll was placed on a 12-month good behaviour bond after pleading guilty to cocaine possession. The magistrate chose not to record a criminal conviction.

<text>Hassler Whitney (March 23, 1907 – May 10, 1989) was an American mathematician. He was one of the founders of singularity theory, and did foundational work in manifolds, embeddings, immersions, characteristic classes and, geometric integration theory

==Biography==

===Life===
Hassler Whitney was born on March 23, 1907, in New York City, where his father, Edward Baldwin Whitney, was the First District New York Supreme Court judge. His mother, A. Josepha Newcomb Whitney, was an artist and political activist. He was the paternal nephew of Connecticut Governor and Chief Justice Simeon E. Baldwin, his paternal grandfather was William Dwight Whitney, professor of Ancient Languages at Yale University, linguist and Sanskrit scholar. Whitney was the great-grandson of Connecticut Governor and US Senator Roger Sherman Baldwin, and the great-great-grandson of American founding father Roger Sherman. His maternal grandparents were astronomer and mathematician Simon Newcomb (1835-1909), a Steeves descendant, and Mary Hassler Newcomb, granddaughter of the first superintendent of the Coast Survey Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler. His great uncle Josiah Whitney was the first to survey Mount Whitney.

He married three times: his first wife was Margaret R. Howell, married on the 30 May 1930. They had three children, James Newcomb, Carol and Marian. After his first divorce, on January 16, 1955 he married Mary Barnett Garfield. He and Mary had two daughters, Sarah Newcomb (later a notable statistician, Sally Thurston), and Emily Baldwin. Finally, Whitney divorced his second wife and married Barbara Floyd Osterman on 8 February 1986.

Whitney and his first wife Margaret made an innovative decision in 1939 that influenced the history of modern architecture in New England, when they commissioned the architect Edwin B. Goodell, Jr. to design a new residence for their family in Weston, Massachusetts. They purchased a rocky hillside site on a historic road, next door to another International Style house by Goodell from several years earlier, designed for Richard and Caroline Field.
Throughout his life he pursued two particular hobbies with excitement: music and mountain-climbing. An accomplished player of the violin and the viola, Whitney played with the Princeton Musical Amateurs. He would run outside, 6 to 12 miles every other day. As an undergraduate, with his cousin Bradley Gilman, Whitney made the first ascent of the Whitney–Gilman ridge on Cannon Mountain, New Hampshire in 1929. It was the hardest and most famous rock climb in the East. He was a member of the Swiss Alpine Society and the Yale Mountaineering Society (the precursor to the Yale Outdoors Club) and climbed most of the mountain peaks in Switzerland.

====Death====
Three years after his third marriage, on 10 May 1989, Whitney died in Princeton, after suffering a stroke. In accordance with his wish, Hassler Whitney&#x27;s ashes rest atop mountain Dent Blanche in Switzerland where Oscar Burlet, another mathematician and member of the Swiss Alpine Club, placed them on August 20, 1989.

===Academic career===
Whitney attended Yale University, where he received baccalaureate degrees in physics and in music, respectively in 1928 and in 1929. Later, in 1932, he earned a PhD in mathematics at Harvard University. His doctoral dissertation was &quot;The Coloring of Graphs&quot;, written under the supervision of George David Birkhoff.
At Harvard, Birkhoff also got him a job as Instructor of Mathematics for the years 1930–31, and an Assistant Professorship for the years 1934–35. Later on he held the following working positions: NRC Fellow, Mathematics, 1931–33; Assistant Professor, 1935–40; Associate Professor, 1940–46, Professor, 1946–52; Professor Instructor, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University, 1952–77; Professor Emeritus, 1977–89; Chairman of the Mathematics Panel, National Science Foundation, 1953–56; Exchange Professor, Collège de France, 1957; Memorial Committee, Support of Research in Mathematical Sciences, National Research Council, 1966–67; President, International Commission of Mathematical Instruction, 1979–82; Research Mathematician, National Defense Research Committee, 1943–45; Construction of the School of Mathematics.

He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences; Colloquium Lecturer, American Mathematical Society, 1946; Vice President, 1948–50 and Editor, American Journal of Mathematics, 1944–49; Editor, Mathematical Reviews, 1949–54; Chairman of the Committee vis. lectureship, 1946–51; Committee Summer Instructor, 1953–54;, American Mathematical Society; American National Council Teachers of Mathematics, London Mathematical Society (Honorary), Swiss Mathematics Society (Honorary), Académie des Sciences de Paris (Foreign Associate); New York Academy of Sciences.

===Honors===
In 1947 he was elected member of the American Philosophical Society.
In 1969 he was awarded the Lester R. Ford Award for the paper in two parts &quot;&quot;The mathematics of Physical quantities&quot; (1968a, 1968b). In 1976 he was awarded the National Medal of Science. In 1980 he was elected honorary member of the London Mathematical Society. In 1982, he received the Wolf Prize from the Wolf Foundation, and finally, in 1985, he was awarded the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society.

==Work==

===Research===
Whitney&#x27;s earliest work, from 1930 to 1933, was on graph theory. Many of his contributions were to the graph-coloring, and the ultimate computer-assisted solution to the four-color problem relied on some of his results. His work in graph theory culminated in a 1933 paper, where he laid the foundations for matroids, a fundamental notion in modern combinatorics and representation theory independently introduced by him and Bartel Leendert van der Waerden in the mid 1930s. In this paper Whitney proved several theorems about the matroid of a graph : one such theorem, now called Whitney&#x27;s 2-Isomorphism Theorem, states: Given and are graphs with no isolated vertices. Then and are isomorphic if and only if and are 2-isomorphic.

Whitney&#x27;s lifelong interest in geometric properties of functions also began around this time. His earliest work in this subject was on the possibility of extending a function defined on a closed subset of formula_1 to a function on all of formula_1 with certain smoothness properties. A complete solution to this problem was found only in 2005 by Charles Fefferman.

In a 1936 paper, Whitney gave a definition of a smooth manifold of class &quot; &quot;r&quot;, and proved that, for high enough values of &quot;r&quot;, a smooth manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot; may be embedded in formula_3, and immersed in formula_4. (In 1944 he managed to reduce the dimension of the ambient space by 1, provided that &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, by a technique that has come to be known as the &quot;Whitney trick&quot;.) This basic result shows that manifolds may be treated intrinsically or extrinsically, as we wish. The intrinsic definition had been published only a few years earlier in the work of Oswald Veblen and J. H. C. Whitehead. These theorems opened the way for much more refined studies of embedding, immersion and also of smoothing—that is, the possibility of having various smooth structures on a given topological manifold.

He was one of the major developers of cohomology theory, and characteristic classes, as these concepts emerged in the late 1930s, and his work on algebraic topology continued into the 40s. He also returned to the study of functions in the 1940s, continuing his work on the extension problems formulated a decade earlier, and answering a question of Laurent Schwartz in a 1948 paper &quot;On Ideals of Differentiable Functions&quot;.

Whitney had, throughout the 1950s, an almost unique interest in the topology of singular spaces and in singularities of smooth maps. An old idea, implicit even in the notion of a simplicial complex, was to study a singular space by decomposing it into smooth pieces (nowadays called &quot;strata&quot;). Whitney was the first to see any subtlety in this definition, and pointed out that a good &quot;stratification&quot; should satisfy conditions he termed &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, now referred to as Whitney conditions. The work of René Thom and John Mather in the 1960s showed that these conditions give a very robust definition of stratified space.
The singularities in low dimension of smooth mappings, later to come to prominence in the work of René Thom, were also first studied by Whitney.

In his book &quot;Geometric Integration Theory&quot; he gives a theoretical basis for Stokes&#x27; theorem applied with singularities on the boundary:. Later, his work on such topics inspired the research of Jenny Harrison.

These aspects of Whitney&#x27;s work have looked more unified, in retrospect and with the general development of singularity theory. Whitney&#x27;s purely topological work (Stiefel–Whitney class, basic results on vector bundles) entered the mainstream more quickly.

===Teaching===

In 1967, he became involved full-time in educational problems, especially at the elementary school level.
He spent many years in classrooms, both teaching mathematics and observing how it is taught. He spent four months teaching pre-algebra mathematics to a classroom of seventh graders and conducted summer courses for teachers. He traveled widely to lecture on the subject in the United States and abroad. He worked toward removing &quot;mathematical anxiety,&quot; which he felt leads young pupils to avoid mathematics. Whitney spread the ideas of teaching mathematics to students in ways that relate the content to their own lives as opposed to teaching them rote memorization.

<text>Darwen Football Club is a football club from Darwen, Lancashire, England. The club was formed in 2009 as A.F.C. Darwen, a successor to the original Darwen club, which had been wound up. They currently play in the and are based at the Anchor Ground.

==History==

On 22 December 2003 Carlsberg Tetley tried to wind up Darwen Football and Social Club. Although the club, then playing in Division One of the North West Counties League, avoided liquidation on that occasion, another winding up petition was brought by The Bee radio station on 14 April 2008 in respect of £8,000 owed for advertising. Plans were made for Blackburn with Darwen Council to buy the Anchor Ground. However, following two further petitions for liquidation brought by Thwaites Brewery and ING Lease UK and their refusal of an offer of 25p in the pound, the 134-year old Darwen Football Club was wound up in the High Court on 14 May 2009.

Almost immediately, there were plans for a new Darwen football club to be formed. This was achieved before the start of the 2009–10 season, with AFC Darwen created, taking over the Anchor Ground from the dissolved club. However, the new club had to start at step 7 (level 11) of the football pyramid. They successfully applied for admission to the West Lancashire League, and were placed in the Premier Division. After finishing eighth in their first season, they were promoted to Division One of the North West Counties League. In 2014–15 the club won the Division One Trophy with a 3–1 win over Atherton Collieries in the final, also finishing third in Division One and qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After beating Chadderton 2–1 in the semi-finals, they defeated Hanley Town 5–3 in the final, earning promotion to the Premier Division.

The 2017–18 season saw AFC Darwen finish bottom of the Premier Division, resulting in relegation to Division One North. In June 2022 the club was renamed Darwen Football Club.

As Part of the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee Celebrations, in summer 2022 The Club announced it would be reverting back to it&#x27;s original name Darwen Football Club.

<text>Mangalia (, ), ancient Callatis (; other historical names: Pangalia, Panglicara, Tomisovara), is a city and a port on the coast of the Black Sea in the south-east of Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, Romania.

The municipality of Mangalia also administers several summertime seaside resorts: Cap Aurora, Jupiter, Neptun, Olimp, Saturn, Venus.

==History==
The Greek colony of Callatis was founded in the 6th century BC by the city of Heraclea Pontica. Like the other Greek cities on the coast nearby, it became a Greek city-state with its own &quot;chora&quot; (territory) which included the fortified settlement of Albesti 15km distant. Its first silver coinage was minted around 350 BC. 

The Macedonians invaded the area from 339 BC against which Callatis and the nearby Greek cities revolted leading to the siege of the city in 313-311 by Lysimachus and its reoccupation.

In 72 BC, Callatis was conquered by the Roman general Lucullus and was assigned to the Roman province of Moesia Inferior. Throughout the 2nd century AD, the city built defensive fortifications and the minting of coinage under the Roman emperors Septimius Severus and Caracalla continued. Callatis suffered multiple invasions in the 3rd century but recovered in the 4th century to regain its status as an important trade hub and port city. From the 7th to the 11th century the city was under the rule of the First Bulgarian Empire.

Callatis existed until the mid-7th century under this name. Life in the town resumed from the 10th century. In the 13th century Callatis came to be known as Pangalia. The Vlachs called it Tomisovara and the Greeks called it Panglicara. From the 16th century the town had acquired its present name, Mangalia. 

Between March and July 1878 the city of Mangalia was part of Bulgaria according to the Treaty of San Stefano. In July 1878 the Congress of Berlin modified the Treaty of San Stefano. According to Article XLVI the Bulgaria–Romania border in Dobrudja was defined as &quot;a line starting from the east of Silistra and terminating on the Black Sea, south of Mangalia.&quot;

===Sights===
A Roman Byzantine building has been excavated against the city wall and next to a street paved with big limestone tiles and which has a channel on its longitudinal axis. It is composed of an atrium with a complex system for collecting rainwater, a palace composed of monumental halls with columns and a basilica. It was probably a bishop&#x27;s palace.

==Geography and climate==
Mangalia is positioned at 43°49’ latitude and 28°35’ longitude, with an approximate elevation of 10 meters, south of the municipality of Constanţa, on the same latitude as the French resort of Nice. Mangalia is one of the southernmost resorts on the Romanian coast of the Black Sea.

Mangalia is characterized by a moderate maritime climate (annual average temperature - one of the highest in Romania) with hot summers (July average over ) and mild winters (January average ), Mangalia being the country&#x27;s second place, after Băile Herculane, with positive average temperatures in wintertime. Spring comes early but is cool and autumn is long and warm. In summer, cloudiness is reduced (about 25 sunny days in a month) and the duration of sunshine is of 10–12 hours a day. Annual precipitation is low (about ).

The sea breeze is stronger in summer. The natural cure factors are the water of the Black Sea, which is chlorided, sulphated, sodic, magnesian, hypotonic (mineralization 15.5g), the sulphurous, chlorided, bicarbonated, sodic, calcic, mesothermal (21-28 °C) mineral waters of the springs in the northern part of the city, in the area of the beach between Saturn and Venus, the sulphurous peat mud, rich in minerals, which is extracted from the peat bog north of the city (expected to last another 250 years) and the marine climate, rich in saline aerosols and solar radiation that have a bracing effect on the organism.

The resort has a large, fine-sand beach developed for purposes of aeroheliotherapy and wave therapy, as well as high seawalls with a specific microclimate where one may benefit from inhalations of saline aerosols having therapeutic effects.
==Demographics==
At the 2021 census Mangalia had a population of 31,950 with a majority of Romanians (74.27%) and minorities of Tatars (3.07%), Turks (2.01%), Lipovans (0.19%), Roma (0.18%), Hungarians (0.13%), Bulgarians (0.01%), others (0.78%) and unknown (19.36%). 

At the 2011 census Mangalia had a population of 36,364 with a majority of Romanians (82.4%) and minorities of Turks (4.05%), Tatars (3.25%), Roma (0.45%), Lipovans (0.32%), Hungarians (0.23%), others (0.14%) and unknown (9.16%). 

According to the religion of the respondents for whom data is available, 89.5% were Romanian Orthodox, 8.3% Muslim, 0.9% Roman Catholic, 0.3% Pentecostal, and 1% other or none.

<doc id="391816" wikidata="Q521075" url="?curid=391816" title="Connection (vector bundle)">
<text>In mathematics, and especially differential geometry and gauge theory, a connection on a fiber bundle is a device that defines a notion of parallel transport on the bundle; that is, a way to &quot;connect&quot; or identify fibers over nearby points. The most common case is that of a linear connection on a vector bundle, for which the notion of parallel transport must be linear. A linear connection is equivalently specified by a &quot;covariant derivative&quot;, an operator that differentiates sections of the bundle along tangent directions in the base manifold, in such a way that parallel sections have derivative zero. Linear connections generalize, to arbitrary vector bundles, the Levi-Civita connection on the tangent bundle of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, which gives a standard way to differentiate vector fields. Nonlinear connections generalize this concept to bundles whose fibers are not necessarily linear.

Linear connections are also called Koszul connections after Jean-Louis Koszul, who gave an algebraic framework for describing them .

This article defines the connection on a vector bundle using a common mathematical notation which de-emphasizes coordinates. However, other notations are also regularly used: in general relativity, vector bundle computations are usually written using indexed tensors; in gauge theory, the endomorphisms of the vector space fibers are emphasized. The different notations are equivalent, as discussed in the article on metric connections (the comments made there apply to all vector bundles).

==Motivation==

Let be a differentiable manifold, such as Euclidean space. A vector-valued function formula_1 can be viewed as a section of the trivial vector bundle formula_2 One may consider a section of a general differentiable vector bundle, and it is therefore natural to ask if it is possible to differentiate a section, as a generalization of how one differentiates a function on .

The model case is to differentiate a function formula_3 on Euclidean space formula_4. In this setting the derivative formula_5 at a point formula_6 in the direction formula_7 may be defined by the standard formula
:formula_8
For every formula_6, this defines a new vector formula_10

When passing to a section formula_11 of a vector bundle formula_12 over a manifold formula_13, one encounters two key issues with this definition. Firstly, since the manifold has no linear structure, the term formula_14 makes no sense on formula_13. Instead one takes a path formula_16 such that formula_17 and computes 
:formula_18
However this still does not make sense, because formula_19 and formula_20 are elements of the distinct vector spaces formula_21 and formula_22 This means that subtraction of these two terms is not naturally defined.

The problem is resolved by introducing the extra structure of a connection to the vector bundle. There are at least three perspectives from which connections can be understood. When formulated precisely, all three perspectives are equivalent.

# (&quot;Parallel transport&quot;) A connection can be viewed as assigning to every differentiable path formula_23 a linear isomorphism formula_24 for all formula_25 Using this isomorphism one can transport formula_19 to the fibre formula_27 and then take the difference; explicitly, formula_28In order for this to depend only on formula_29 and not on the path formula_23 extending formula_29 it is necessary to place restrictions (in the definition) on the dependence of formula_32 on formula_33 This is not straightforward to formulate, and so this notion of &quot;parallel transport&quot; is usually derived as a by-product of other ways of defining connections. In fact, the following notion of &quot;Ehresmann connection&quot; is nothing but an infinitesimal formulation of parallel transport.
# (&quot;Ehresmann connection&quot;) The section formula_11 may be viewed as a smooth map from the smooth manifold formula_13 to the smooth manifold formula_36 As such, one may consider the pushforward formula_37 which is an element of the tangent space formula_38 In Ehresmann&#x27;s formulation of a connection, one chooses a way of assigning, to each formula_39 and every formula_40 a direct sum decomposition of formula_41 into two linear subspaces, one of which is the natural embedding of formula_22 With this additional data, one defines formula_43 by projecting formula_44 to be valued in formula_22 In order to respect the linear structure of a vector bundle, one imposes additional restrictions on how the direct sum decomposition of formula_46 moves as is varied over a fiber.
# (&quot;Covariant derivative&quot;) The standard derivative formula_44 in Euclidean contexts satisfies certain dependencies on formula_11 and formula_29 the most fundamental being linearity. A covariant derivative is defined to be any operation formula_50 which mimics these properties, together with a form of the product rule. 

Unless the base is zero-dimensional, there are always infinitely many connections which exist on a given differentiable vector bundle, and so there is always a corresponding &quot;choice&quot; of how to differentiate sections. Depending on context, there may be distinguished choices, for instance those which are determined by solving certain partial differential equations. In the case of the tangent bundle, any pseudo-Riemannian metric (and in particular any Riemannian metric) determines a canonical connection, called the Levi-Civita connection.

==Formal definition==
Let formula_51 be a smooth real vector bundle over a smooth manifold formula_13. Denote the space of smooth sections of formula_51 by formula_54. A covariant derivative on formula_51 is either of the following equivalent structures:
# an formula_56-linear map formula_57 such that the product rule formula_58 holds for all smooth functions formula_59 on formula_13 and all smooth sections formula_61 of formula_36
# an assignment, to any smooth section and every formula_63, of a formula_56-linear map formula_65 which depends smoothly on and such that formula_66 for any two smooth sections formula_67 and any real numbers formula_68 and such that for every smooth function formula_59, formula_70 is related to formula_71 by formula_72 for any formula_63 and formula_74
Beyond using the canonical identification between the vector space formula_75 and the vector space of linear maps formula_76 these two definitions are identical and differ only in the language used.

It is typical to denote formula_77 by formula_78 with formula_39 being implicit in formula_80 With this notation, the product rule in the second version of the definition given above is written
:formula_81

&quot;Remark.&quot; In the case of a complex vector bundle, the above definition is still meaningful, but is usually taken to be modified by changing &quot;real&quot; and &quot;formula_56&quot; everywhere they appear to &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;formula_83&quot; This places extra restrictions, as not every real-linear map between complex vector spaces is complex-linear. There is some ambiguity in this distinction, as a complex vector bundle can also be regarded as a real vector bundle.

== Induced connections ==

Given a vector bundle formula_51, there are many associated bundles to formula_12 which may be constructed, for example the dual vector bundle formula_86, tensor powers formula_87, symmetric and antisymmetric tensor powers formula_88, and the direct sums formula_89. A connection on formula_12 induces a connection on any one of these associated bundles. The ease of passing between connections on associated bundles is more elegantly captured by the theory of principal bundle connections, but here we present some of the basic induced connections.

=== Dual connection ===
Given formula_91 a connection on formula_12, the induced dual connection formula_93 on formula_86 is defined implicitly by
:formula_95
Here formula_96 is a smooth vector field, formula_97 is a section of formula_12, and formula_99 a section of the dual bundle, and formula_100 the natural pairing between a vector space and its dual (occurring on each fibre between formula_12 and formula_86), i.e., formula_103. Notice that this definition is essentially enforcing that formula_93 be the connection on formula_86 so that a natural product rule is satisfied for pairing formula_106.

=== Tensor product connection ===
Given formula_107 connections on two vector bundles formula_108, define the tensor product connection by the formula
:formula_109
Here we have formula_110. Notice again this is the natural way of combining formula_107 to enforce the product rule for the tensor product connection. By repeated application of the above construction applied to the tensor product formula_112, one also obtains the tensor power connection on formula_87 for any formula_114 and vector bundle formula_12.

=== Direct sum connection ===

The direct sum connection is defined by

:formula_116
where formula_117.

=== Symmetric and exterior power connections ===

Since the symmetric power and exterior power of a vector bundle may be viewed naturally as subspaces of the tensor power, formula_118, the definition of the tensor product connection applies in a straightforward manner to this setting. Indeed, since the symmetric and exterior algebras sit inside the tensor algebra as direct summands, and the connection formula_91 respects this natural splitting, one can simply restrict formula_91 to these summands. Explicitly, define the symmetric product connection by
:formula_121
and the exterior product connection by
:formula_122
for all formula_123. Repeated applications of these products gives induced symmetric power and exterior power connections on formula_124 and formula_125 respectively.

=== Endomorphism connection ===

Finally, one may define the induced connection formula_126 on the vector bundle of endomorphisms formula_127, the endomorphism connection. This is simply the tensor product connection of the dual connection formula_93 on formula_86 and formula_91 on formula_12. If formula_97 and formula_133, so that the composition formula_134 also, then the following product rule holds for the endomorphism connection:
:formula_135

By reversing this equation, it is possible to define the endomorphism connection as the unique connection satisfying

:formula_136

for any formula_137, thus avoiding the need to first define the dual connection and tensor product connection.

=== Any associated bundle ===

Given a vector bundle formula_12 of rank formula_139, and any representation formula_140 into a linear group formula_141, there is an induced connection on the associated vector bundle formula_142. This theory is most succinctly captured by passing to the principal bundle connection on the frame bundle of formula_12 and using the theory of principal bundles. Each of the above examples can be seen as special cases of this construction: the dual bundle corresponds to the inverse transpose (or inverse adjoint) representation, the tensor product to the tensor product representation, the direct sum to the direct sum representation, and so on.

==Exterior covariant derivative and vector-valued forms==

Let formula_51 be a vector bundle. An formula_12-valued differential form of degree formula_139 is a section of the tensor product bundle:

:formula_147

The space of such forms is denoted by

:formula_148
where the last tensor product denotes the tensor product of modules over the ring of smooth functions on formula_13.

An formula_12-valued 0-form is just a section of the bundle formula_12. That is,

:formula_152

In this notation a connection on formula_51 is a linear map

:formula_154

A connection may then be viewed as a generalization of the exterior derivative to vector bundle valued forms. In fact, given a connection formula_91 on formula_12 there is a unique way to extend formula_91 to an exterior covariant derivative

:formula_158

This exterior covariant derivative is defined by the following Leibniz rule, which is specified on simple tensors of the form formula_159 and extended linearly:

:formula_160

where formula_161 so that formula_162, formula_97 is a section, and formula_164 denotes the formula_165-form with values in formula_12 defined by wedging formula_167 with the one-form part of formula_71. Notice that for formula_12-valued 0-forms, this recovers the normal Leibniz rule for the connection formula_91.

Unlike the ordinary exterior derivative, one generally has formula_171. In fact, formula_172 is directly related to the curvature of the connection formula_91 (see below).

==Affine properties of the set of connections==

Every vector bundle over a manifold admits a connection, which can be proved using partitions of unity. However, connections are not unique. If formula_174 and formula_175 are two connections on formula_51 then their difference is a formula_177-linear operator. That is,
:formula_178
for all smooth functions formula_59 on formula_13 and all smooth sections formula_61 of formula_12. It follows that the difference formula_183 can be uniquely identified with a one-form on formula_13 with values in the endomorphism bundle formula_127:
:formula_186
Conversely, if formula_91 is a connection on formula_12 and formula_189 is a one-form on formula_13 with values in formula_191, then formula_192 is a connection on formula_12.

In other words, the space of connections on formula_12 is an affine space for formula_195. This affine space is commonly denoted formula_196.

==Relation to principal and Ehresmann connections==

Let formula_51 be a vector bundle of rank formula_198 and let formula_199 be the frame bundle of formula_12. Then a (principal) connection on formula_199 induces a connection on formula_12. First note that sections of formula_12 are in one-to-one correspondence with right-equivariant maps formula_204. (This can be seen by considering the pullback of formula_12 over formula_206, which is isomorphic to the trivial bundle formula_207.) Given a section formula_61 of formula_12 let the corresponding equivariant map be formula_210. The covariant derivative on formula_12 is then given by
:formula_212
where formula_213 is the horizontal lift of formula_11 from formula_13 to formula_199. (Recall that the horizontal lift is determined by the connection on formula_199.)

Conversely, a connection on formula_12 determines a connection on formula_199, and these two constructions are mutually inverse.

A connection on formula_12 is also determined equivalently by a linear Ehresmann connection on formula_12. This provides one method to construct the associated principal connection.

The induced connections discussed in #Induced connections can be constructed as connections on other associated bundles to the frame bundle of formula_12, using representations other than the standard representation used above. For example if formula_223 denotes the standard representation of formula_224 on formula_225, then the associated bundle to the representation formula_226 of formula_224 on formula_228 is the direct sum bundle formula_229, and the induced connection is precisely that which was described above.

==Local expression==
Let formula_51 be a vector bundle of rank formula_198, and let formula_232 be an open subset of formula_13 over which formula_12 trivialises. Therefore over the set formula_232, formula_12 admits a local smooth frame of sections

:formula_237
Since the frame formula_238 defines a basis of the fibre formula_27 for any formula_240, one can expand any local section formula_241 in the frame as
:formula_242
for a collection of smooth functions formula_243.

Given a connection formula_91 on formula_12, it is possible to express formula_91 over formula_232 in terms of the local frame of sections, by using the characteristic product rule for the connection. For any basis section formula_248, the quantity formula_249 may be expanded in the local frame formula_238 as

:formula_251

where formula_252 are a collection of local one-forms. These forms can be put into a matrix of one-forms defined by

:formula_253

called the &quot;local connection form of formula_91 over formula_232&quot;. The action of formula_91 on any section formula_257 can be computed in terms of formula_189 using the product rule as

:formula_259
If the local section formula_61 is also written in matrix notation as a column vector using the local frame formula_238 as a basis,

:formula_262
then using regular matrix multiplication one can write
:formula_263
where formula_264 is shorthand for applying the exterior derivative formula_265 to each component of formula_61 as a column vector. In this notation, one often writes locally that formula_267. In this sense a connection is locally completely specified by its connection one-form in some trivialisation.

As explained in #Affine properties of the set of connections, any connection differs from another by an endomorphism-valued one-form. From this perspective, the connection one-form formula_189 is precisely the endomorphism-valued one-form such that the connection formula_269 on formula_270 differs from the trivial connection formula_265 on formula_270, which exists because formula_232 is a trivialising set for formula_12.

=== Relationship to Christoffel symbols ===

In pseudo-Riemannian geometry, the Levi-Civita connection is often written in terms of the Christoffel symbols formula_275 instead of the connection one-form formula_189. It is possible to define Christoffel symbols for a connection on any vector bundle, and not just the tangent bundle of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. To do this, suppose that in addition to formula_232 being a trivialising open subset for the vector bundle formula_51, that formula_232 is also a local chart for the manifold formula_13, admitting local coordinates formula_281.

In such a local chart, there is a distinguished local frame for the differential one-forms given by formula_282, and the local connection one-forms formula_283 can be expanded in this basis as

:formula_284

for a collection of local smooth functions formula_285, called the &quot;Christoffel symbols&quot; of formula_91 over formula_232. In the case where formula_288 and formula_91 is the Levi-Civita connection, these symbols agree precisely with the Christoffel symbols from pseudo-Riemannian geometry.

The expression for how formula_91 acts in local coordinates can be further expanded in terms of the local chart formula_232 and the Christoffel symbols, to be given by

:formula_292
Contracting this expression with the local coordinate tangent vector formula_293 leads to
:formula_294

This defines a collection of formula_295 locally defined operators

:formula_296

with the property that

:formula_297

=== Change of local trivialisation ===

Suppose formula_298 is another choice of local frame over the same trivialising set formula_232, so that there is a matrix formula_300 of smooth functions relating formula_238 and formula_298, defined by
:formula_303
Tracing through the construction of the local connection form formula_189 for the frame formula_238, one finds that the connection one-form formula_306 for formula_298 is given by
:formula_308
where formula_309 denotes the inverse matrix to formula_310. In matrix notation this may be written
:formula_311

where formula_312 is the matrix of one-forms given by taking the exterior derivative of the matrix formula_310 component-by-component.

In the case where formula_288 is the tangent bundle and formula_310 is the Jacobian of a coordinate transformation of formula_13, the lengthy formulae for the transformation of the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection can be recovered from the more succinct transformation laws of the connection form above.

==Parallel transport and holonomy==

A connection formula_91 on a vector bundle formula_51 defines a notion of parallel transport on formula_12 along a curve in formula_13. Let formula_321 be a smooth path in formula_13. A section formula_61 of formula_12 along formula_23 is said to be parallel if
:formula_326
for all formula_327. Equivalently, one can consider the pullback bundle formula_328 of formula_12 by formula_23. This is a vector bundle over formula_331 with fiber formula_21 over formula_327. The connection formula_91 on formula_12 pulls back to a connection on formula_328. A section formula_61 of formula_328 is parallel if and only if formula_339.

Suppose formula_23 is a path from formula_39 to formula_342 in formula_13. The above equation defining parallel sections is a first-order ordinary differential equation (cf. local expression above) and so has a unique solution for each possible initial condition. That is, for each vector formula_344 in formula_27 there exists a unique parallel section formula_61 of formula_328 with formula_348. Define a parallel transport map
:formula_349
by formula_350. It can be shown that formula_351 is a linear isomorphism, with inverse given by following the same procedure with the reversed path formula_352 from formula_342 to formula_39.

Parallel transport can be used to define the holonomy group of the connection formula_91 based at a point formula_39 in formula_13. This is the subgroup of formula_358 consisting of all parallel transport maps coming from loops based at formula_39:
:formula_360
The holonomy group of a connection is intimately related to the curvature of the connection .

The connection can be recovered from its parallel transport operators as follows. If formula_96 is a vector field and formula_97 a section, at a point formula_63 pick an integral curve formula_364 for formula_11 at formula_39. For each formula_367 we will write formula_368 for the parallel transport map traveling along formula_23 from formula_370 to formula_371. In particular for every formula_367, we have formula_373. Then formula_374 defines a curve in the vector space formula_27, which may be differentiated. The covariant derivative is recovered as
:formula_376
This demonstrates that an equivalent definition of a connection is given by specifying all the parallel transport isomorphisms formula_377 between fibres of formula_12 and taking the above expression as the definition of formula_91.

==Curvature==

The curvature of a connection formula_91 on formula_51 is a 2-form formula_382 on formula_13 with values in the endomorphism bundle formula_127. That is,
:formula_385
It is defined by the expression
:formula_386
where formula_11 and formula_388 are tangent vector fields on formula_13 and formula_61 is a section of formula_12. One must check that formula_382 is formula_177-linear in both formula_11 and formula_388 and that it does in fact define a bundle endomorphism of formula_12.

As mentioned above, the covariant exterior derivative formula_397 need not square to zero when acting on formula_12-valued forms. The operator formula_172 is, however, strictly tensorial (i.e. formula_177-linear). This implies that it is induced from a 2-form with values in formula_191. This 2-form is precisely the curvature form given above. For an formula_12-valued form formula_403 we have
:formula_404

A flat connection is one whose curvature form vanishes identically.

=== Local form and Cartan&#x27;s structure equation ===

The curvature form has a local description called Cartan&#x27;s structure equation. If formula_91 has local form formula_189 on some trivialising open subset formula_407 for formula_12, then
:formula_409
on formula_232. To clarify this notation, notice that formula_189 is a endomorphism-valued one-form, and so in local coordinates takes the form of a matrix of one-forms. The operation formula_265 applies the exterior derivative component-wise to this matrix, and formula_413 denotes matrix multiplication, where the components are wedged rather than multiplied.

In local coordinates formula_414 on formula_13 over formula_232, if the connection form is written formula_417 for a collection of local endomorphisms formula_418, then one has

:formula_419

Further expanding this in terms of the Christoffel symbols formula_420 produces the familiar expression from Riemannian geometry. Namely if formula_421 is a section of formula_12 over formula_232, then

:formula_424
Here formula_425 is the full curvature tensor of formula_382, and in Riemannian geometry would be identified with the Riemannian curvature tensor.

It can be checked that if we define formula_427 to be wedge product of forms but commutator of endomorphisms as opposed to composition, then formula_428, and with this alternate notation the Cartan structure equation takes the form
:formula_429
This alternate notation is commonly used in the theory of principal bundle connections, where instead we use a connection form formula_167, a Lie algebra-valued one-form, for which there is no notion of composition (unlike in the case of endomorphisms), but there is a notion of a Lie bracket.

In some references (see for example ) the Cartan structure equation may be written with a minus sign:
:formula_431
This different convention uses an order of matrix multiplication that is different from the standard Einstein notation in the wedge product of matrix-valued one-forms.

===Bianchi identity===

A version of the second (differential) Bianchi identity from Riemannian geometry holds for a connection on any vector bundle. Recall that a connection formula_91 on a vector bundle formula_51 induces an endomorphism connection on formula_191. This endomorphism connection has itself an exterior covariant derivative, which we ambiguously call formula_397. Since the curvature is a globally defined formula_191-valued two-form, we may apply the exterior covariant derivative to it. The Bianchi identity says that
:formula_437.
This succinctly captures the complicated tensor formulae of the Bianchi identity in the case of Riemannian manifolds, and one may translate from this equation to the standard Bianchi identities by expanding the connection and curvature in local coordinates.

There is no analogue in general of the &quot;first&quot; (algebraic) Bianchi identity for a general connection, as this exploits the special symmetries of the Levi-Civita connection. Namely, one exploits that the vector bundle indices of formula_288 in the curvature tensor formula_439 may be swapped with the cotangent bundle indices coming from formula_440 after using the metric to lower or raise indices. For example this allows the torsion-freeness condition formula_441 to be defined for the Levi-Civita connection, but for a general vector bundle the formula_442-index refers to the local coordinate basis of formula_440, and the formula_444-indices to the local coordinate frame of formula_12 and formula_86 coming from the splitting formula_447. However in special circumstance, for example when the rank of formula_12 equals the dimension of formula_13 and a solder form has been chosen, one can use the soldering to interchange the indices and define a notion of torsion for affine connections which are not the Levi-Civita connection.

== Gauge transformations ==

Given two connections formula_450 on a vector bundle formula_51, it is natural to ask when they might be considered equivalent. There is a well-defined notion of an automorphism of a vector bundle formula_51. A section formula_133 is an automorphism if formula_454 is invertible at every point formula_63. Such an automorphism is called a gauge transformation of formula_12, and the group of all automorphisms is called the gauge group, often denoted formula_457 or formula_458. The group of gauge transformations may be neatly characterised as the space of sections of the &quot;capital A adjoint bundle&quot; formula_459 of the frame bundle of the vector bundle formula_12. This is not to be confused with the &quot;lowercase a adjoint bundle&quot; formula_461, which is naturally identified with formula_191 itself. The bundle formula_463 is the associated bundle to the principal frame bundle by the conjugation representation of formula_464 on itself, formula_465, and has fibre the same general linear group formula_466 where formula_467. Notice that despite having the same fibre as the frame bundle formula_199 and being associated to it, formula_459 is not equal to the frame bundle, nor even a principal bundle itself. The gauge group may be equivalently characterised as formula_470

A gauge transformation formula_471 of formula_12 acts on sections formula_97, and therefore acts on connections by conjugation. Explicitly, if formula_91 is a connection on formula_12, then one defines formula_476 by
:formula_477
for formula_478. To check that formula_476 is a connection, one verifies the product rule
:formula_480
It may be checked that this defines a left group action of formula_457 on the affine space of all connections formula_196.

Since formula_196 is an affine space modelled on formula_484, there should exist some endomorphism-valued one-form formula_485 such that formula_486. Using the definition of the endomorphism connection formula_487 induced by formula_91, it can be seen that
:formula_489
which is to say that formula_490.

Two connections are said to be gauge equivalent if they differ by the action of the gauge group, and the quotient space formula_491 is the moduli space of all connections on formula_12. In general this topological space is neither a smooth manifold or even a Hausdorff space, but contains inside it the moduli space of Yang–Mills connections on formula_12, which is of significant interest in gauge theory and physics.

==Examples==

* A classical covariant derivative or affine connection defines a connection on the tangent bundle of &quot;M&quot;, or more generally on any tensor bundle formed by taking tensor products of the tangent bundle with itself and its dual.
* A connection on formula_494 can be described explicitly as the operator
::formula_495
:where formula_265 is the exterior derivative evaluated on vector-valued smooth functions and formula_497 are smooth. A section formula_498 may be identified with a map 
::formula_499
:and then
::formula_500
* If the bundle is endowed with a bundle metric, an inner product on its vector space fibers, a metric connection is defined as a connection that is compatible with the bundle metric.
* A Yang-Mills connection is a special metric connection which satisfies the Yang-Mills equations of motion.
* A Riemannian connection is a metric connection on the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold.
* A Levi-Civita connection is a special Riemannian connection: the metric-compatible connection on the tangent bundle that is also torsion-free. It is unique, in the sense that given any Riemannian connection, one can always find one and only one equivalent connection that is torsion-free. &quot;Equivalent&quot; means it is compatible with the same metric, although the curvature tensors may be different; see teleparallelism. The difference between a Riemannian connection and the corresponding Levi-Civita connection is given by the contorsion tensor.
* The exterior derivative is a flat connection on formula_501 (the trivial line bundle over &quot;M&quot;).
* More generally, there is a canonical flat connection on any flat vector bundle (i.e. a vector bundle whose transition functions are all constant) which is given by the exterior derivative in any trivialization.

<doc id="391823" wikidata="Q1326230" url="?curid=391823" title="Nihon University">
<text>, abbreviated as , is a private research university in Japan. Its predecessor, Nihon Law School (currently the Department of Law), was founded by Yamada Akiyoshi, the Minister of Justice, in 1889. The university&#x27;s name is derived from the Japanese word &quot;Nihon&quot; meaning Japan. Nihon University now has 16 colleges and 87 departments, 20 postgraduate schools, one junior college which is composed of five departments, one correspondence division, 32 research institutes and three hospitals. The number of students exceeds 70,000 and is the largest in Japan.

== University profile ==
Most of the university&#x27;s campuses are in the Kantō region, with the vast majority in Tokyo or surrounding areas, although two campuses are as far away from Tokyo as Shizuoka Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture. These campuses mostly accommodate single colleges or schools ( in Japanese). In December 2016 the university acquired the former Newcastle Court House in , New South Wales, Australia for 6.6 million as its inaugural international campus.

The university comprises a federation of colleges and institutes known for having produced numerous Japanese CEOs. Its College of Art (日芸 — &quot;Nichigei&quot;), located right next to Ekoda train station in Tokyo&#x27;s Nerima ward, is well-known for producing many artists who represent Japan in photography, theater, and cinema. In addition, the university has over 20 affiliated high schools bearing its name across Japan, from which a significant number of students go on to study at the institution as undergraduates.

== Controversies ==

=== American football team scandals ===

====Dirty tackle====
In May 2018, at an American football game between the Nihon University Phoenix and the Kwansei Gakuin University Fighters, a Nihon University team member violently tackled an opposing team member from behind after play was over. The tackled Kwansei Gakuin team member received an injury in his back ligaments as a result, and had to take a month out from football to recover. A third-party committee convened by Nihon University to investigate the incident found that the Nihon University team&#x27;s coach and assistant coach had instructed a team member to dirty-tackle that particular player on the Kwansei Gakuin team. Furthermore, another independent investigation, by the Kantoh Collegiate American Football Association, reached the same conclusion, and expelled the coaches from the Association. Nihon University reached an out-of-court settlement with the injured Kwansei Gakuin team player. A decision by Tokyo&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Department not to prosecute the coaches was harshly criticized by those who had carried out the above investigations.

====Drug possession====
Three members of the Nihon University American football team were arrested between August and November 2023 for suspicion of using cannabis. In August 2023 police searched the team&#x27;s dormitory after the university found pieces of a plant and pills there the previous month. The university suspended the team&#x27;s activities in September following the first arrest. Following a second arrest in October, it was reported that notes from an August meeting of university executives suggested ten or more members of the American football team may have used cannabis.

In November 2023 the Nihon University Board of Trustees recommended the resignation of its President Takeo Sakai and its Vice President Yasuhiro Sawada, while Trustees Chair Mariko Hayashi agreed to a 50% pay cut. Soon after a third person was arrested, Japanese news sources reported that Nihon University planned to disband its American football team after a history of 83 years, during which it won the Koshien Bowl 21 times and the Rice Bowl four times. A third-party investigation into how the matter was handled, led by lawyer Hideaki Kubori, suggested a culture of secrecy and xenophobia on the part of university officials.

=== Alleged tax evasion by Chairman of the Board ===
On November 29, 2021, the former chairman of the board of Nihon University, Hidetoshi Tanaka, was arrested for alleged tax evasion, and indicted by prosecutors on December 20. Tanaka had allegedly received approximately 118 million yen in bribes from 2018 to 2020 paid by contractors in return for contracts being awarded for work at Nihon University. He had allegedly failed to declare the money as income, thus allegedly evading payment of approximately 52 million yen in tax. Tanaka announced his resignation on December 1, 2021. By accepting his resignation rather than dismissing him, the board ensured that Tanaka would remain eligible for a retirement bonus of hundreds of millions of yen.

<text>Mary Ann Moorman (; born August 5, 1932) is an American woman who chanced to photograph US president John F. Kennedy a fraction of a second after he was fatally shot in the head in Dallas, Texas. 
The Badge Man, whom conspiracy theorists claim to be one of Kennedy&#x27;s assassins, is purportedly visible in another of her photographs taken that day.

==Biography==
Mary Ann Moorman was born Mary Ann Boshart. She married Donald G. Moorman in 1952 and divorced him in 1973. She later married Gary Krahmer in 1980.

==Assassination witness==

On November 22, 1963, U.S. president John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.

Moorman stated that her 11-year-old son had wanted to see Kennedy, but was unable to attend because of school. She said she promised to take a picture for him.

Moorman was standing on grass about south of the south curb of Elm Street in Dealey Plaza, directly across from the grassy knoll and the North Pergola concrete structure that Abraham Zapruder and his assistant Marilyn Sitzman were standing on – during the assassination. Moorman stated that she stepped off the grass onto the street to take a photo with her Polaroid camera. Zapruder can be seen standing on the pergola in the Moorman photograph, with the presidential limousine already having passed through the line of sight between Zapruder and Moorman.

Both Moorman and her friend, Jean Hill, can be clearly seen in the Zapruder film. Between Zapruder frames 315 and 316, Moorman took a Polaroid photograph, her fifth that day, showing the presidential limousine with the grassy knoll area in the background.

Moorman&#x27;s photograph captured the fatal headshot that killed President Kennedy. When she took it – approximately one-sixth of a second after President Kennedy was struck in the head at Zapruder frame 313, Moorman was standing behind and to the left of President Kennedy, about from the presidential limousine. Moorman said in a TV interview that immediately after the assassination, there were three or four shots close together, that shots were still being fired after the fatal headshot, and that she was in the line of fire. She later stated in a 2013 PBS documentary &quot;Kennedy Half Century&quot; that she was close enough to hear Jackie Kennedy exclaim that John had been shot.

In 2013, Moorman attempted to sell the original Polaroid through Cowan&#x27;s Auctions in Cincinnati. The photo was expected to sell for between $50,000 and $75,000, but did not meet its reserve. Moorman had previously tried selling the photo to Sotheby&#x27;s in New York, but the auction house deemed it to be &quot;too sensitive to auction&quot;. That same year, she expressed her opinion on the assassination; she was convinced that Kennedy was killed as a result of a conspiracy. &quot;I really don&#x27;t know what exactly happened, but I do know there is bound to be a lot more to the story that hasn&#x27;t been told,&quot; she said. &quot;I was hoping it would come out in my lifetime, but who knows. So much has been hidden by the government; anything can take place and it can be hidden. Oswald probably wasn&#x27;t a lone person, he probably had backers. I really do think it was a conspiracy&quot;.

===Controversy===

Whatever was captured in the background of Moorman&#x27;s photo has been a matter of contentious debate. On the grassy knoll, some have claimed to identify as many as four different human figures, while others dismiss these indistinct images as either trees or shadows. Most often, one figure has been dubbed the &quot;Badge Man&quot; as it seems to resemble a uniformed police officer wearing a badge. Others claim to see Gordon Arnold, a man who claimed to have filmed the assassination from that area, a man in a construction hard hat, and a hatted man behind the stockade fence.

Moorman stated she heard a shot as the limousine passed her, then heard another two shots, &quot;pow pow&quot;, when the president&#x27;s head exploded. She stated that she could not determine where the shots came from, and that she saw no one in the area that appeared to have possibly been the assassin. Moorman was interviewed by the Dallas County Sheriff&#x27;s Department and the FBI. She was called by the Warren Commission to testify, but due to a sprained ankle, she was unable to be questioned. She was never contacted by them again.

<text>Louis Buchalter, known as Louis Lepke or Lepke Buchalter, (February 6, 1897March 4, 1944) was a Jewish-American organized crime figure and head of the Mafia hit squad Murder, Inc., during the 1930s. Buchalter was one of the premier labor union racketeers in New York City during that era.

Charles Birger and Buchalter are the only National Crime Syndicate bosses to be executed after being convicted of murder. Buchalter was executed using the infamous &quot;Old Sparky&quot; electric chair after being sent &quot;up the river&quot; to Sing Sing Correctional Facility.

==Background==
Buchalter was born on February 6, 1897 into a large Ashkenazi Jewish family in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. His parents emigrated separately from the Russian Empire and married in 1893 in New York, where they had three sons together. His mother called Louis, their second son, &quot;Lepkeleh&quot; (&quot;little Louis&quot; in Yiddish), which later became &quot;Lepke&quot;.

His father, Barnett (Berl) Buchalter, had been a widower from Pruzhany (now Belarus) who immigrated to the United States in 1890 with three daughters. He was a machinist who operated a hardware store on the Lower East Side. His mother, Rose (Reisel) Kauvar Buchalter (&quot;née&quot; Devaltov or De Waltoff), was from Vilnius and had three sons and two daughters by her first husband. His half-brother was Rabbi Charles Kauvar, while his brother Emanuel became a dentist and brother Isadore a pharmacist. 

In 1909, when Buchalter was 12, his father died. In 1910, Buchalter finished elementary school and started a job selling theatrical goods. Reportedly, on the Lower East Side, he attended the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School, where he was an &quot;honor roll&quot; student. Soon after, his mother moved to Arizona for health reasons, leaving Buchalter in the care of his sister, Sarah. However, Buchalter was beyond her control.

On September 2, 1915, Buchalter was arrested in New York for the first time for burglary and assault, but the case was discharged.

In late 1915 or early 1916, Buchalter went to live with his uncle in Bridgeport, Connecticut. On February 29, 1916, Buchalter was arrested in Bridgeport on burglary charges and was sent to the Cheshire Reformatory for juvenile offenders in Cheshire, Connecticut, until July 12, 1917. After a dispute with his uncle over wages, Buchalter moved back to New York City.

On September 28, 1917, Buchalter was sentenced in New York to 18 months in state prison at Sing Sing in Ossining, New York, on a grand larceny conviction. After a transfer to Auburn Prison in Auburn, New York, Buchalter was released on January 27, 1919. On January 22, 1920, Buchalter returned to Sing Sing on a 30-month sentence for attempted burglary. He was released on March 16, 1922.

==Rise to power==
Upon Buchalter&#x27;s 1922 release from prison, he started working with his childhood friend, mobster Jacob &quot;Gurrah&quot; Shapiro. Through force and fear, they began gaining control of the garment industry unions. Buchalter then used the unions to threaten strikes and demand weekly payments from factory owners while dipping into union bank accounts. Buchalter&#x27;s control of the unions evolved into a protection racket, extending into areas such as bakery trucking. The unions were profitable for him and he kept a hold over them even after becoming an important figure in organized crime. Buchalter later formed an alliance with Tommy Lucchese, a leader of the Lucchese crime family, and together they controlled the garment district.

Buchalter and Shapiro moved into new and fashionable luxury buildings on Eastern Parkway (135) with family who were active synagogue goers (Union Temple and Kol Israel Synagogue of Brooklyn). In later years, Buchalter and his family lived in a penthouse in the exclusive Central Park West section of Manhattan.

In 1927, Buchalter and Shapiro were arrested for the murder of Jacob Orgen (Little Augie) and the attempted murder of Irish-American bootlegger Jack Diamond, a criminal rival. However, the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence.

Buchalter was described as a quiet man who for years managed to avoid the public spotlight. In conversations with his criminal associates, Buchalter preferred listening over talking. Buchalter generously compensated his gang members and took them to hockey games, boxing matches, and even winter cruises. On August 20, 1931, Buchalter married Betty Wasserman, a British-born widow of Russian descent, at New York City Hall. Buchalter adopted Betty&#x27;s child from her previous marriage.

==Murder, Inc.==

In the early 1930s, Buchalter created an effective process for performing contract killings for Cosa Nostra mobsters; it had no name, but the press 10 years later called it Murder, Inc. The Cosa Nostra mobsters wanted to insulate themselves from any connection to these murders. Buchalter&#x27;s partner, mobster Albert Anastasia, would relay a contract request from the Cosa Nostra to Buchalter. In turn, Buchalter would assign the job to Jewish and Italian street gang members from Brooklyn.

None of these contract killers had any connections with the major crime families. If they were caught, they could not implicate their Cosa Nostra employers in the crimes. Buchalter used the same killers for his own murder contracts. The Murder, Inc., killers were soon completing jobs all over the country for their mobster bosses.

In 1935, Buchalter arranged his most significant murder: the powerful New York gangster Dutch Schultz. Schultz had proposed to the National Crime Syndicate, a confederation of mobsters, that New York District Attorney Thomas Dewey be murdered. Co-founder of the Syndicate and leading mafioso Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano argued that a Dewey assassination would precipitate a massive law enforcement crackdown. An enraged Schultz said he would kill Dewey anyway and walked out of the meeting. After six hours of deliberations The Commission ordered Buchalter to eliminate Schultz. On October 23, 1935, Schultz was shot in a Newark, New Jersey tavern, and succumbed to his injuries the following day. In 1941, Buchalter killer Charles &quot;The Bug&quot; Workman was charged in the Schultz murder.

In 1935, law enforcement estimated that Buchalter and Shapiro had 250 men working for them, and that Buchalter was grossing over $1 million ($ in current dollar terms) per year. They controlled rackets in the trucking, baking, and garment industries throughout New York. Buchalter also owned the Riobamba, a posh nightclub in Manhattan.

==Downfall==
On September 13, 1936, Murder, Inc. killers, acting on Buchalter&#x27;s orders, gunned down Joseph Rosen, a Brooklyn candy store owner. Rosen was a former garment industry trucker whose union Buchalter took over. Rosen had angered Buchalter by refusing to leave town as Buchalter demanded when, despite the absence of proof, Buchalter believed Rosen was cooperating with District Attorney Thomas Dewey. At the time, no one was indicted in the Rosen murder.

On November 8, 1936, Buchalter and Shapiro were convicted of violating federal anti-trust laws in the rabbit fur industry in New York. While out on bail, both Buchalter and Shapiro disappeared. On November 13, both men were sentenced in absentia to two years in federal prison. The two men later appealed the verdict, but in June 1937 both convictions were upheld.

==Manhunt==
Before they could be taken into custody, both Buchalter and Shapiro disappeared. On November 9, 1937, the federal government offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to Buchalter&#x27;s capture.

On December 1, 1937, the fugitive Buchalter was indicted in federal court on conspiracy to smuggle heroin into the United States. The scheme involved heroin hidden in the trunks of young women and couples traveling by ocean liner from China to France, then to New York City. Lepke bribed U.S. customs agents not to inspect the trunks.

On April 14, 1938, Shapiro surrendered to authorities in New York. However, Buchalter remained a fugitive.

Over the next two years, an extensive manhunt was conducted in both the United States and Europe, with reports of Buchalter hiding in Poland and Palestine. On July 29, 1939, Thomas Dewey requested that the City of New York offer a $25,000 reward for Buchalter&#x27;s capture, citing a string of unsolved gangland murders. On August 24, 1939, Buchalter surrendered to FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover in front of a Manhattan hotel. The surrender deal was allegedly negotiated by the columnist and radio broadcaster Walter Winchell. It was later revealed that Buchalter had been hiding in New York City during his entire time as a fugitive.

After Buchalter was convicted on the federal narcotics trafficking charges, federal authorities turned him over to New York State for trial on labor extortion charges. On April 5, 1940, Buchalter was sentenced to 30 years to life in state prison on those charges. However, Buchalter was sent to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in Kansas to serve his federal sentence of 14 years for narcotics trafficking.

On August 20, 1940, Buchalter was indicted on murder charges in Los Angeles for the killing of Harry Greenberg, a mob associate of casino owner Meyer Lansky and mobster Bugsy Siegel. However, Buchalter never went to trial on this killing.

==Murder trial==
On May 9, 1941, Buchalter was arraigned in New York state court on the 1936 Rosen murder along with three other murders. Buchalter&#x27;s order for the Rosen hit had been overheard by mobster Abe Reles, who turned state&#x27;s evidence in 1940 and implicated Buchalter in four murders. Returned from Leavenworth to Brooklyn to stand trial for the Rosen slaying, Buchalter&#x27;s position was worsened by the testimony of Albert &quot;Tick-Tock&quot; Tannenbaum. Four hours into deliberation, at 2 am on November 30, 1941, the jury found Buchalter guilty of first degree murder. On December 2, 1941, Lepke was sentenced to death along with his lieutenants Emanuel &quot;Mendy&quot; Weiss and Louis Capone. Buchalter&#x27;s lawyers immediately filed an appeal.

In October 1942, the New York Court of Appeals voted four to three to uphold Buchalter&#x27;s conviction and death sentence. (People v. Buchalter, 289 N.Y. 181) Two dissenting judges thought the evidence was so weak that errors in the jury instructions as to how to evaluate certain testimony were harmful enough to require a new trial. The third dissenter agreed, but added that, in his opinion, there was insufficient evidence to sustain a guilty verdict, so the indictment should be dismissed altogether (failure of proof means no retrial). Buchalter&#x27;s lawyers then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The United States Supreme Court granted Buchalter&#x27;s petition to review the case. In 1943, the Court affirmed the Buchalter conviction seven to zero, with two justices abstaining. (319 U.S. 427 (1943)). His appeals were now exhausted.

==Execution==
When the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed Buchalter&#x27;s conviction, he was serving his racketeering sentence at Leavenworth Federal Prison. New York State authorities demanded that the federal government turn over Buchalter for execution. On January 21, 1944, after many delays and much controversy, federal agents finally turned Buchalter over to state authorities, who immediately transported him to Sing Sing prison. Buchalter made several pleas for mercy, but they were rejected.

On March 4, 1944, Louis Buchalter was executed in the electric chair in Sing Sing. He had no final words. A few minutes before Buchalter&#x27;s execution, his lieutenants Weiss and Capone were also executed.

Louis Buchalter was buried at the Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens.

==In popular culture==

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Buchalter was portrayed by David J. Stewart in the 1960 film &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot;; by Gene Roth, Robert Carricart, and Joseph Ruskin in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; television series of 1959; as well as by John Vivyan and Shepherd Sanders in &quot;The Lawless Years&quot; television series.

The 1975 film &quot;Lepke&quot;, starring Tony Curtis, was based on Buchalter&#x27;s life. Other portrayals include the 1981 film &quot;Gangster Wars&quot; by Ron Max.

Buchalter was also mentioned in &quot;The Legend of Tennessee Moltisanti&quot;, episode eight of the first season of the popular HBO television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

The poet Robert Lowell encountered Buchalter in prison during the 1940s, when Lowell was incarcerated for being a conscientious objector. Lowell described Buchalter (whom he calls &quot;Czar Lepke&quot;) in his poem &quot;Memories of West Street and Lepke&quot;, published in his book &quot;Life Studies&quot; (1959). Lowell&#x27;s poem claims that prior to execution, Lepke had been lobotomized. Their meeting is discussed in the 1993 film &quot;Romeo Is Bleeding&quot;, where Lepke says he&#x27;s in prison because he killed someone and Lowell says he&#x27;s in prison because he didn&#x27;t kill someone.

&quot;The Making of the Mob: New York&quot; (2015) – Buchalter was portrayed by Evan Boymel.

Buchalter&#x27;s labor racketeering and extortion is prominently featured in &quot;Button Man, &quot; a 2018 novel by Andrew Gross partially based on Gross&#x27;s maternal grandfather&#x27;s career in the New York City garment industry.

<text>Wilmersdorf (), an inner-city locality of Berlin, lies south-west of the central city. Formerly a borough by itself, Wilmersdorf became part of the new borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf in Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform.

==History==

The village near Berlin was first mentioned in 1293 as &quot;Wilmerstorff&quot;, probably founded in the course of the German &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot; under the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. From the 1850s on &quot;Deutsch-Wilmersdorf&quot; was developed as a densely settled, affluent residential area, which in 1920 became a part of Greater Berlin. The former borough of Wilmersdorf included the localities of Halensee, Schmargendorf and Grunewald.

During the era of the Weimar Republic Wilmersdorf was a popular residential area for artists and intellectuals.

In 1923 the foundation stone for the first mosque in Germany was laid on the initiative of some Islamic students in Wilmersdorf. It was completed in 1925. The so called Wilmersdorfer Moschee (&quot;Mosque of Wilmersdorf&quot;) is still owned and maintained by the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement.

In 1933, the year in which Hitler came to power, 13.5% of the population was Jewish; many of them were deported by the Nazis from Berlin-Grunewald Station. Deutsche Bahn established a memorial on 27 January 1998 at the historic track 17 (&quot;Gleis 17&quot;), where most of the deportation trains departed. The synagogue of Wilmersdorf in the &quot;Prinzregentenstraße&quot; was destroyed by the Nazis in the Reichspogromnacht on 9–10 November 1938. A memorial plaque commemorates the former synagogue. A new synagogue and community centre was established 2007 in the &quot;Münstersche Straße&quot; for the growing Jewish community in Wilmersdorf.

During World War II, Wilmersdorf was the location of a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After 1945 Wilmersdorf was located in the British Zone of occupation.

<doc id="391830" wikidata="Q1547287" url="?curid=391830" title="Groklaw">
<text>Groklaw was a website that covered legal news of interest to the free and open source software community. Started as a law blog on May 16, 2003, by paralegal Pamela Jones (&quot;PJ&quot;), it covered issues such as the SCO-Linux lawsuits, the EU antitrust case against Microsoft, and the standardization of Office Open XML.

Jones described &quot;Groklaw&quot; as &quot;a place where lawyers and geeks could explain things to each other and work together, so they&#x27;d understand each other&#x27;s work better&quot;.

Its name derives from &quot;grok&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;to understand completely&quot;, which had previously entered geek slang.

Other topics covered included software patents, DMCA, the actions of the RIAA against alleged illegal file sharers, and actions against free and open software such as Android and Linux.

==Origins==
According to a 2003 interview with Jones, the blog was started to cover legal news and to explain it to the tech community.

The first article was entitled &quot;The Grokster Decision – Ode To Thomas Jefferson&quot;. It was about the effect of P2P on the music industry, and the then-recent court decision in &quot;MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.&quot;, by Judge Steven Wilson in favor of the defendants. It also covered the previous Napster decision, and why it was different, causing Napster to be shut down. The article included a quote from Thomas Jefferson and references to David Boies, who was Napster&#x27;s attorney.

The second post, on May 17, 2003, also covered legal issues – the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; lawsuit – entitled &quot;SCO Falls Downstairs, Hitting its Head on Every Step&quot;. It criticized Caldera Systems for the way they were handling the suit outside of court, and included quotes from Bruce Perens, Richard Stallman, Steve Ballmer, and Linus Torvalds. It ended:
:David Boies has agreed to represent SCO. I am trying to remind myself that our legal system is predicated on lawyers sometimes representing people they don&#x27;t personally admire, and the system really does depend on someone being willing to take on unpopular clients. I know Boies doesn&#x27;t use email, or at least he didn&#x27;t the last time I checked. So maybe he doesn&#x27;t quite get the tech ... ah, hang it all, there&#x27;s no way around it: I feel bad he&#x27;s chosen to represent them, especially after I posted an Ode singing his praises, and I hope he loses.

The blog soon became popular with the free software and open source communities and others, and attracted a community of volunteers and commenters. Its popularity caused it to outgrow Radio Userland, and on November 22, 2003, the standalone &quot;Groklaw&quot; website, hosted by ibiblio and running Geeklog software, was up and running.

==Main focus==
The main focus of Jones&#x27;s writing became the &quot;Caldera Systems v. IBM&quot; litigation (Caldera Systems changed its name to The SCO Group during this time). Other issues were explored, including intellectual property and patent issues (for example, Microsoft IP claims against Linux, and the drafting of the GPL version 3). &quot;Groklaw&quot; was known for its contributors&#x27; ability to explain complex legal issues in simple terms and the research used in putting together articles. Members of the &quot;Groklaw&quot; community attended court hearings and interviewed movers and shakers in the software/IP world.

The site became a community effort. While Jones understood law, she was not a programmer. Many readers were techies, however, and when technical issues arose they provided relevant comments. This enabled &quot;Groklaw&quot; to solicit guest commentary on issues such as:

* Linux kernel coding practices
* C language programming
* Operating systems programming
* Operating systems history
* Standards organizations

Each of these issues appeared to have some application to the &quot;SCO v. IBM&quot; case, and most were revisited many times. Additional topics included later lawsuits by The SCO Group against Daimler Chrysler, AutoZone, and Novell, the countersuit by Red Hat, and their implications and Microsoft&#x27;s attempt to fast track OOXML as an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard.

==Awards==
&quot;Groklaw&quot; was cited by the attorneys for several firms in law journal articles. It also won awards:
* 2012 – ABA Journal Blawg 100
* 2010 – The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Pioneer Award
* 2009 – Top 200 Tech Blogs: The Datamation 2009 List &quot;The famed Groklaw is still going strong, far past the SCO case that first brought the blog to prominence.&quot;
* 2008 – The Award for Projects of Social Benefit – The Free Software Foundation (FSF)
* 2007 – Knowledge Masters Award for Innovation – Knowledge Trust and the Louis Round Wilson Academy
* 2007 – Best FUD Fighter – Google-O&#x27;Reilly Open Source Awards
* 2005 – Best News Site – ConsortiumInfo*.org – Pamela Jones/&quot;Groklaw&quot;: Best Community Site or Blog (Non-Profit)
* 2005 – Best Blogger of the Year – Dana Blankenhorn, Corante
* 2004 – Best Website of 2004 – The Inquirer
* 2004 – Best Independent Tech Blog – TechWeb Network: Readers Choice Award
* 2004 – Best Nontechnical or Community Website – Linux Journal: Editors&#x27; Choice Award
* 2003 – Best News Site – OSDir.com: Editor&#x27;s Choice Winner

==Editorial stance==
&quot;Groklaw&quot; was the personal creation of Jones, and it published articles (both news and opinion) from a self-described pro-FOSS, anti-FUD perspective.

While articles meticulously followed SCO&#x27;s litigation activities, they were accompanied by reader-submitted comments that were &quot;overwhelmingly pro-Linux and anti-SCO.&quot;

==Media controversy==
Jones was widely respected by journalists and people inside the Linux community. Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols wrote, &quot;Jones has made her reputation as a top legal IT reporter from her work detailing the defects with SCO&#x27;s case against IBM and Linux. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that her work has contributed enormously to everyone&#x27;s coverage of SCO&#x27;s cases.&quot;

Despite the high regard of Jones&#x27; peer journalists and the Linux community (or possibly in part because of it) , a number of prominent attacks against &quot;Groklaw&quot; and Jones occurred. These attacks were documented and addressed in detail, on &quot;Groklaw&quot; and other web sites and also in court as part of the SCO litigation .

During the first week of May 2005, Maureen O&#x27;Gara, writing in &quot;Linux World&quot;, wrote an exposé claiming to unmask Jones. Two weeks before O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s publication, McBride said that SCO was investigating Jones&#x27; identity. The article included alleged, but unverified, personal information about Jones, including a photo of Jones&#x27; supposed house and purported addresses and telephone numbers for Jones and her mother. After a flood of complaints to the publisher, lobbying of the site&#x27;s advertisers, and claims of a denial-of-service attack launched against the Sys-Con domain, &quot;Linux Business News&quot;&#x27; publisher Sys-Con issued a public apology, and said they dropped O&#x27;Gara and her &quot;LinuxGram&quot; column. Despite this assertion, O&#x27;Gara remained with Sys-Con; as of 2009, she is the Virtualization News Desk editor at Sys-Con Media, who describe her as &quot;[o]ne of the most respected technology reporters in the business&quot; and has her work published in multiple magazines owned by Sys-Con Media.

SCO executives Darl McBride and Blake Stowell also denigrated Jones, and claimed that she worked for IBM. Jones denied this allegation, as did IBM in a court filing. During an SCO conference call on April 13, 2005, McBride said, &quot;The reality is the web site is full of misinformation, including the people who are actually running it&quot; when talking about &quot;Groklaw&quot;, adding also &quot;What I would say is that it is not what it is purported to be&quot;. Later developments in the court cases showed that McBride&#x27;s statements to the press regarding the SCO litigation had limited credibility; very few such statements were ever substantiated and most were shown to be false. For example, McBride claimed that SCO owned the copyrights to UNIX, and SCO filed suit to try to enforce these claims. The outcome went against McBride&#x27;s claims. The jury found that SCO had not purchased these copyrights.
SCO appealed this ruling and lost. McBride also made a claim to the press that there was a &quot;mountain of code&quot; misappropriated to create Linux. When SCO finally presented their evidence of infringement, which centered on nine lines of error name and number similarities in the file errno.h, Judge Wells famously said &quot;Is this all you&#x27;ve got?&quot; Professor Randall Davis of MIT later made a convincing demonstration that there were no elements of UNIX which might be copyright protectable present in the Linux source code.

==Additional projects==
Anticipating further legal threats against GNU, Linux, and the free software community, Jones launched Grokline, a Unix ownership timeline project, in May 2004. One notable result of the &quot;Groklaw&quot;/Grokline effort was obtaining and publishing the 1994 settlement in &quot;USL v. BSDi&quot;, which for over a decade had been sealed by the parties. The document was obtained through a California freedom of information statute (the University of California, being a publicly funded institution, is required by law to make almost all of its documents public), and the release of the settlement answered many questions as to the ownership of the Unix intellectual property.

The Linux documentation project Grokdoc wiki was started in 2004, with the stated goal &quot;to create a useful manual on basic tasks that new users will find simple and clear and easy to follow.&quot;

&quot;Groklaw&quot; extensively covered patent problems with software and hardware, use of the DMCA against free software ideals, Open standards, digital rights management, GPLv3, and published &quot;The Daemon, the GNU &amp; the Penguin&quot;, a series of articles by Peter Salus covering the history of Unix, Linux and the GNU project.

It covered the Oracle v. Google in which Oracle alleged that Google&#x27;s Android platform infringed copyrights and patents related to Java.

==Later history==
In January 2009, &quot;Groklaw&quot; entered a second phase, focusing on consolidation and cleanup of the legal history collected on the site.

In April 2010, &quot;Groklaw&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for its web archival project, in the category of Legal Blogs.

On April 9, 2011, Jones announced that &quot;Groklaw&quot; would stop publishing new articles on May 16, 2011, its 8th anniversary, as it had accomplished its original mission of revealing the truth behind the SCO lawsuits.

On May 16, 2011, Jones reaffirmed her desire to step down from writing daily articles and announced that the new editor would be Mark Webbink.

Subsequent to this decision, new patent and copyright based attacks on the Android operating system led to Jones resuming an editorial role, and along with Mark Webbink she moderated and edited the site.

On August 20, 2013, a final article appeared on &quot;Groklaw&quot;, explaining that due to pervasive government monitoring of the Internet, there could no longer be an expectation of the sort of privacy online that was necessary to collaborate on sensitive topics. Citing the closure of Lavabit earlier that month, Jones wrote &quot;I can&#x27;t do Groklaw without your input... and there is now no private way, evidently, to collaborate.&quot; and &quot;What I do know is it&#x27;s not possible to be fully human if you are being surveilled 24/7... I hope that makes it clear why I can&#x27;t continue. There is now no shield from forced exposure.&quot;

During 2020, the site was intermittently unavailable. , the home page and parts of the content were still available. As of Oct 2024, although the domain name is still registered, the landing page displays a GoDaddy domain-parking page.

<text>In mathematics, cobordism is a fundamental equivalence relation on the class of compact manifolds of the same dimension, set up using the concept of the boundary (French &quot;&quot;, giving &quot;cobordism&quot;) of a manifold. Two manifolds of the same dimension are &quot;cobordant&quot; if their disjoint union is the &quot;boundary&quot; of a compact manifold one dimension higher.

The boundary of an formula_1-dimensional manifold formula_2 is an formula_3-dimensional manifold formula_4 that is closed, i.e., with empty boundary. In general, a closed manifold need not be a boundary: cobordism theory is the study of the difference between all closed manifolds and those that are boundaries. The theory was originally developed by René Thom for smooth manifolds (i.e., differentiable), but there are now also versions for
piecewise linear and topological manifolds.

A &quot;cobordism&quot; between manifolds formula_5 and formula_6 is a compact manifold formula_2 whose boundary is the disjoint union of formula_5 and formula_6, formula_10.

Cobordisms are studied both for the equivalence relation that they generate, and as objects in their own right. Cobordism is a much coarser equivalence relation than diffeomorphism or homeomorphism of manifolds, and is significantly easier to study and compute. It is not possible to classify manifolds up to diffeomorphism or homeomorphism in dimensions ≥ 4 – because the word problem for groups cannot be solved – but it is possible to classify manifolds up to cobordism. Cobordisms are central objects of study in geometric topology and algebraic topology. In geometric topology, cobordisms are intimately connected with Morse theory, and -cobordisms are fundamental in the study of high-dimensional manifolds, namely surgery theory. In algebraic topology, cobordism theories are fundamental extraordinary cohomology theories, and categories of cobordisms are the domains of topological quantum field theories.

== Definition ==
===Manifolds===
Roughly speaking, an formula_3-dimensional manifold formula_5 is a topological space locally (i.e., near each point) homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space formula_13. A manifold with boundary is similar, except that a point of formula_5 is allowed to have a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of the half-space

:formula_15

Those points without a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space are the boundary points of formula_5; the boundary of formula_5 is denoted by formula_18. Finally, a closed manifold is, by definition, a compact manifold without boundary (formula_19).

===Cobordisms===
An formula_1-dimensional &quot;cobordism&quot; is a quintuple formula_21 consisting of an formula_1-dimensional compact differentiable manifold with boundary, formula_2; closed formula_3-manifolds formula_5, formula_6; and embeddings formula_27, formula_28 with disjoint images such that

:formula_29

The terminology is usually abbreviated to formula_30. formula_5 and formula_6 are called &quot;cobordant&quot; if such a cobordism exists. All manifolds cobordant to a fixed given manifold formula_5 form the &quot;cobordism class&quot; of formula_5.

Every closed manifold formula_5 is the boundary of the non-compact manifold formula_36; for this reason we require formula_2 to be compact in the definition of cobordism. Note however that formula_2 is &quot;not&quot; required to be connected; as a consequence, if formula_39 and formula_40, then formula_5 and formula_6 are cobordant.

===Examples===
The simplest example of a cobordism is the unit interval formula_43. It is a 1-dimensional cobordism between the 0-dimensional manifolds formula_44, formula_45. More generally, for any closed manifold formula_5, formula_47 is a cobordism from formula_48 to formula_49.

If formula_5 consists of a circle, and formula_6 of two circles, formula_5 and formula_6 together make up the boundary of a pair of pants formula_2 (see the figure at right). Thus the pair of pants is a cobordism between formula_5 and formula_6. A simpler cobordism between formula_5 and formula_6 is given by the disjoint union of three disks.

The pair of pants is an example of a more general cobordism: for any two formula_3-dimensional manifolds formula_5, formula_61, the disjoint union formula_62 is cobordant to the connected sum formula_63 The previous example is a particular case, since the connected sum formula_64 is isomorphic to formula_65 The connected sum formula_66 is obtained from the disjoint union formula_62 by surgery on an embedding of formula_68 in formula_62, and the cobordism is the trace of the surgery.

===Terminology===
An &quot;n&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot; is called &quot;null-cobordant&quot; if there is a cobordism between &quot;M&quot; and the empty manifold; in other words, if &quot;M&quot; is the entire boundary of some (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-manifold. For example, the circle is null-cobordant since it bounds a disk. More generally, a &quot;n&quot;-sphere is null-cobordant since it bounds a (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-disk. Also, every orientable surface is null-cobordant, because it is the boundary of a handlebody. On the other hand, the 2&quot;n&quot;-dimensional real projective space formula_70 is a (compact) closed manifold that is not the boundary of a manifold, as is explained below.

The general &quot;bordism problem&quot; is to calculate the cobordism classes of manifolds subject to various conditions.

Null-cobordisms with additional structure are called fillings. &quot;Bordism&quot; and &quot;cobordism&quot; are used by some authors interchangeably; others distinguish them. When one wishes to distinguish the study of cobordism classes from the study of cobordisms as objects in their own right, one calls the equivalence question &quot;bordism of manifolds&quot;, and the study of cobordisms as objects &quot;cobordisms of manifolds&quot;.

The term &quot;bordism&quot; comes from French , meaning boundary. Hence bordism is the study of boundaries. &quot;Cobordism&quot; means &quot;jointly bound&quot;, so &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are cobordant if they jointly bound a manifold; i.e., if their disjoint union is a boundary. Further, cobordism groups form an extraordinary &quot;cohomology theory&quot;, hence the co-.

===Variants===
The above is the most basic form of the definition. It is also referred to as unoriented bordism. In many situations, the manifolds in question are oriented, or carry some other additional structure referred to as G-structure. This gives rise to &quot;oriented cobordism&quot; and &quot;cobordism with G-structure&quot;, respectively. Under favourable technical conditions these form a graded ring called the cobordism ring formula_71, with grading by dimension, addition by disjoint union and multiplication by cartesian product. The cobordism groups formula_71 are the coefficient groups of a generalised homology theory.

When there is additional structure, the notion of cobordism must be formulated more precisely: a &quot;G&quot;-structure on &quot;W&quot; restricts to a &quot;G&quot;-structure on &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot;. The basic examples are &quot;G&quot; = O for unoriented cobordism, &quot;G&quot; = SO for oriented cobordism, and &quot;G&quot; = U for complex cobordism using &quot;stably&quot; complex manifolds. Many more are detailed by Robert E. Stong.

In a similar vein, a standard tool in surgery theory is surgery on normal maps: such a process changes a normal map to another normal map within the same bordism class.

Instead of considering additional structure, it is also possible to take into account various notions of manifold, especially piecewise linear (PL) and topological manifolds. This gives rise to bordism groups formula_73, which are harder to compute than the differentiable variants.

==Surgery construction==
Recall that in general, if &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; are manifolds with boundary, then the boundary of the product manifold is .

Now, given a manifold &quot;M&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot; and an embedding formula_74 define the &quot;n&quot;-manifold

:formula_75

obtained by surgery, via cutting out the interior of formula_76 and gluing in formula_77 along their boundary

:formula_78

The trace of the surgery

:formula_79

defines an elementary cobordism (&quot;W&quot;; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;). Note that &quot;M&quot; is obtained from &quot;N&quot; by surgery on formula_80 This is called reversing the surgery.

Every cobordism is a union of elementary cobordisms, by the work of Marston Morse, René Thom and John Milnor.

===Examples===

As per the above definition, a surgery on the circle consists of cutting out a copy of formula_81 and gluing in formula_82 The pictures in Fig. 1 show that the result of doing this is either (i) formula_83 again, or (ii) two copies of formula_83


For surgery on the 2-sphere, there are more possibilities, since we can start by cutting out either formula_85 or formula_86

==Morse functions==
Suppose that &quot;f&quot; is a Morse function on an (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-dimensional manifold, and suppose that &quot;c&quot; is a critical value with exactly one critical point in its preimage. If the index of this critical point is &quot;p&quot; + 1, then the level-set &quot;N&quot; := &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;c&quot; + ε) is obtained from &quot;M&quot; := &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;c&quot; − ε) by a &quot;p&quot;-surgery. The inverse image &quot;W&quot; := &quot;f&quot;−1([&quot;c&quot; − ε, &quot;c&quot; + ε]) defines a cobordism (&quot;W&quot;; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) that can be identified with the trace of this surgery.

===Geometry, and the connection with Morse theory and handlebodies===
Given a cobordism (&quot;W&quot;; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) there exists a smooth function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;W&quot; → [0, 1] such that &quot;f&quot;−1(0) = &quot;M&quot;, &quot;f&quot;−1(1) = &quot;N&quot;. By general position, one can assume &quot;f&quot; is Morse and such that all critical points occur in the interior of &quot;W&quot;. In this setting &quot;f&quot; is called a Morse function on a cobordism. The cobordism (&quot;W&quot;; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) is a union of the traces of a sequence of surgeries on &quot;M&quot;, one for each critical point of &quot;f&quot;. The manifold &quot;W&quot; is obtained from &quot;M&quot; × [0, 1] by attaching one handle for each critical point of &quot;f&quot;.
The Morse/Smale theorem states that for a Morse function on a cobordism, the flowlines of &quot;f&quot;′ give rise to a handle presentation of the triple (&quot;W&quot;; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;). Conversely, given a handle decomposition of a cobordism, it comes from a suitable Morse function. In a suitably normalized setting this process gives a correspondence between handle decompositions and Morse functions on a cobordism.

==History==
Cobordism had its roots in the (failed) attempt by Henri Poincaré in 1895 to define homology purely in terms of manifolds . Poincaré simultaneously defined both homology and cobordism, which are not the same, in general. See Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory for the relationship between bordism and homology.

Bordism was explicitly introduced by Lev Pontryagin in geometric work on manifolds. It came to prominence when René Thom showed that cobordism groups could be computed by means of homotopy theory, via the Thom complex construction. Cobordism theory became part of the apparatus of extraordinary cohomology theory, alongside K-theory. It performed an important role, historically speaking, in developments in topology in the 1950s and early 1960s, in particular in the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, and in the first proofs of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem.

In the 1980s the category with compact manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms played a basic role in the Atiyah–Segal axioms for topological quantum field theory, which is an important part of quantum topology.

==Categorical aspects==
Cobordisms are objects of study in their own right, apart from cobordism classes. Cobordisms form a category whose objects are closed manifolds and whose morphisms are cobordisms. Roughly speaking, composition is given by gluing together cobordisms end-to-end: the composition of (&quot;W&quot;; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) and (&quot;W&quot; ′; &quot;N&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) is defined by gluing the right end of the first to the left end of the second, yielding (&quot;W&quot; ′ ∪&quot;N&quot; &quot;W&quot;; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;P&quot;). A cobordism is a kind of cospan: &quot;M&quot; → &quot;W&quot; ← &quot;N&quot;. The category is a dagger compact category.

A topological quantum field theory is a monoidal functor from a category of cobordisms to a category of vector spaces. That is, it is a functor whose value on a disjoint union of manifolds is equivalent to the tensor product of its values on each of the constituent manifolds.

In low dimensions, the bordism question is relatively trivial, but the category of cobordism is not. For instance, the disk bounding the circle corresponds to a nullary (0-ary) operation, while the cylinder corresponds to a 1-ary operation and the pair of pants to a binary operation.

==Unoriented cobordism==
The set of cobordism classes of closed unoriented &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifolds is usually denoted by formula_87 (rather than the more systematic formula_88); it is an abelian group with the disjoint union as operation. More specifically, if [&quot;M&quot;] and [&quot;N&quot;] denote the cobordism classes of the manifolds &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; respectively, we define formula_89; this is a well-defined operation which turns formula_87 into an abelian group. The identity element of this group is the class formula_91 consisting of all closed &quot;n&quot;-manifolds which are boundaries. Further we have formula_92 for every &quot;M&quot; since formula_93. Therefore, formula_87 is a vector space over formula_95, the field with two elements. The cartesian product of manifolds defines a multiplication formula_96 so

:formula_97

is a graded algebra, with the grading given by the dimension.

The cobordism class formula_98 of a closed unoriented &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; is determined by the Stiefel–Whitney characteristic numbers of &quot;M&quot;, which depend on the stable isomorphism class of the tangent bundle. Thus if &quot;M&quot; has a stably trivial tangent bundle then formula_99. In 1954 René Thom proved

:formula_100

the polynomial algebra with one generator formula_101 in each dimension formula_102. Thus two unoriented closed &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifolds &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot; are cobordant, formula_103 if and only if for each collection formula_104 of &quot;k&quot;-tuples of integers formula_105 such that formula_106 the Stiefel-Whitney numbers are equal

:formula_107

with formula_108 the &quot;i&quot;th Stiefel-Whitney class and formula_109 the formula_95-coefficient fundamental class.

For even &quot;i&quot; it is possible to choose formula_111, the cobordism class of the &quot;i&quot;-dimensional real projective space.

The low-dimensional unoriented cobordism groups are

:formula_112

This shows, for example, that every 3-dimensional closed manifold is the boundary of a 4-manifold (with boundary).

The Euler characteristic formula_113 modulo 2 of an unoriented manifold &quot;M&quot; is an unoriented cobordism invariant. This is implied by the equation

:formula_114

for any compact manifold with boundary formula_2.

Therefore, formula_116 is a well-defined group homomorphism. For example, for any formula_117

:formula_118

In particular such a product of real projective spaces is not null-cobordant. The mod 2 Euler characteristic map formula_119 is onto for all formula_120 and a group isomorphism for formula_121

Moreover, because of formula_122, these group homomorphisms assemble into a homomorphism of graded algebras:

:formula_123

==Cobordism of manifolds with additional structure==
Cobordism can also be defined for manifolds that have additional structure, notably an orientation. This is made formal in a general way using the notion of &quot;X&quot;-structure (or G-structure). Very briefly, the normal bundle ν of an immersion of &quot;M&quot; into a sufficiently high-dimensional Euclidean space formula_124 gives rise to a map from &quot;M&quot; to the Grassmannian, which in turn is a subspace of the classifying space of the orthogonal group: ν: &quot;M&quot; → Gr(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;n&quot; + &quot;k&quot;) → &quot;BO&quot;(&quot;k&quot;). Given a collection of spaces and maps &quot;Xk&quot; → &quot;Xk&quot;+1 with maps &quot;Xk&quot; → &quot;BO&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) (compatible with the inclusions &quot;BO&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) → &quot;BO&quot;(&quot;k&quot;+1), an &quot;X&quot;-structure is a lift of ν to a map formula_125. Considering only manifolds and cobordisms with &quot;X&quot;-structure gives rise to a more general notion of cobordism. In particular, &quot;Xk&quot; may be given by &quot;BG&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), where &quot;G&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) → &quot;O&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is some group homomorphism. This is referred to as a G-structure. Examples include &quot;G&quot; = &quot;O&quot;, the orthogonal group, giving back the unoriented cobordism, but also the subgroup SO(&quot;k&quot;), giving rise to oriented cobordism, the spin group, the unitary group &quot;U&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), and the trivial group, giving rise to framed cobordism.

The resulting cobordism groups are then defined analogously to the unoriented case. They are denoted by formula_71.

===Oriented cobordism===

Oriented cobordism is the one of manifolds with an SO-structure. Equivalently, all manifolds need to be oriented and cobordisms (&quot;W&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) (also referred to as &quot;oriented cobordisms&quot; for clarity) are such that the boundary (with the induced orientations) is formula_127, where −&quot;N&quot; denotes &quot;N&quot; with the reversed orientation. For example, boundary of the cylinder &quot;M&quot; × &quot;I&quot; is formula_128: both ends have opposite orientations. It is also the correct definition in the sense of extraordinary cohomology theory.

Unlike in the unoriented cobordism group, where every element is two-torsion, 2&quot;M&quot; is not in general an oriented boundary, that is, 2[&quot;M&quot;] ≠ 0 when considered in formula_129

The oriented cobordism groups are given modulo torsion by

:formula_130

the polynomial algebra generated by the oriented cobordism classes

:formula_131

of the complex projective spaces (Thom, 1952). The oriented cobordism group formula_132 is determined by the Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin characteristic numbers (Wall, 1960). Two oriented manifolds are oriented cobordant if and only if their Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin numbers are the same.

The low-dimensional oriented cobordism groups are :

:formula_133

The signature of an oriented 4&quot;i&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; is defined as the signature of the intersection form on formula_134 and is denoted by formula_135 It is an oriented cobordism invariant, which is expressed in terms of the Pontrjagin numbers by the Hirzebruch signature theorem.

For example, for any &quot;i&quot;1, ..., &quot;ik&quot; ≥ 1

:formula_136

The signature map formula_137 is onto for all &quot;i&quot; ≥ 1, and an isomorphism for &quot;i&quot; = 1.

==Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory==
Every vector bundle theory (real, complex etc.) has an extraordinary cohomology theory called K-theory. Similarly, every cobordism theory Ω&quot;G&quot; has an extraordinary cohomology theory, with homology (&quot;bordism&quot;) groups formula_138 and cohomology (&quot;cobordism&quot;) groups formula_139 for any space &quot;X&quot;. The generalized homology groups formula_140 are covariant in &quot;X&quot;, and the generalized cohomology groups formula_141 are contravariant in &quot;X&quot;. The cobordism groups defined above are, from this point of view, the homology groups of a point: formula_142. Then formula_138 is the group of &quot;bordism&quot; classes of pairs (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;f&quot;) with &quot;M&quot; a closed &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; (with G-structure) and &quot;f&quot; : &quot;M&quot; → &quot;X&quot; a map. Such pairs (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;f&quot;), (&quot;N&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) are &quot;bordant&quot; if there exists a G-cobordism (&quot;W&quot;; &quot;M&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) with a map &quot;h&quot; : &quot;W&quot; → &quot;X&quot;, which restricts to &quot;f&quot; on &quot;M&quot;, and to &quot;g&quot; on &quot;N&quot;.

An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; has a fundamental homology class [&quot;M&quot;] ∈ &quot;Hn&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) (with coefficients in formula_144 in general, and in formula_145 in the oriented case), defining a natural transformation

:formula_146

which is far from being an isomorphism in general.

The bordism and cobordism theories of a space satisfy the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms apart from the dimension axiom. This does not mean that the groups formula_139 can be effectively computed once one knows the cobordism theory of a point and the homology of the space &quot;X&quot;, though the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence gives a starting point for calculations. The computation is only easy if the particular cobordism theory reduces to a product of ordinary homology theories, in which case the bordism groups are the ordinary homology groups

:formula_148

This is true for unoriented cobordism. Other cobordism theories do not reduce to ordinary homology in this way, notably framed cobordism, oriented cobordism and complex cobordism. The last-named theory in particular is much used by algebraic topologists as a computational tool (e.g., for the homotopy groups of spheres).

Cobordism theories are represented by Thom spectra &quot;MG&quot;: given a group &quot;G&quot;, the Thom spectrum is composed from the Thom spaces &quot;MGn&quot; of the standard vector bundles over the classifying spaces &quot;BGn&quot;. Note that even for similar groups, Thom spectra can be very different: &quot;MSO&quot; and &quot;MO&quot; are very different, reflecting the difference between oriented and unoriented cobordism.

From the point of view of spectra, unoriented cobordism is a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spectra – &quot;MO&quot; = &quot;H&quot;(∗(&quot;MO&quot;)) – while oriented cobordism is a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spectra rationally, and at 2, but not at odd primes: the oriented cobordism spectrum &quot;MSO&quot; is rather more complicated than &quot;MO&quot;.

==Other results==
In 1959, C.T.C. Wall proved that two manifolds are cobordant if and only if their Pontrjagin numbers and Stiefel numbers are the same.

<text>Michael Te-pei Chang (born February 22, 1972) is an American former professional tennis player and coach. He was ranked world No. 2 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in 1996. Chang is the youngest man in history to win a singles major, winning the 1989 French Open at 17 years and 109 days old. He won a total of 34 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including seven Masters titles, and was a three-time major runner-up. 

Chang was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2008. He began coaching Kei Nishikori in 2014.

==Early life==
Michael Te-Pei Chang was born to Joe and Betty Chang on February 22, 1972, in Hoboken, New Jersey. Chang&#x27;s parents had emigrated to the United States from Taiwan.

After moving from Hoboken to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he learned tennis, Chang and his family moved first to Placentia, California, and then to Encinitas, California, to increase the tennis opportunities for him and his older brother, Carl. Growing up, Chang learned some Chinese from his Taiwanese parents and can speak Mandarin. Betty quit her job as a chemist to travel with Chang on tour. After rising to #163 in the world as a 15-year-old amateur, Chang dropped out of tenth grade at San Dieguito High School in Encinitas to pursue a professional tennis career. He received his GED in February 1988.

==Tennis career==
===Junior career===
Chang first came to the tennis world&#x27;s attention at age 12 as an outstanding junior player who set numerous &quot;youngest-ever&quot; records. At age 12 he also won his first national title, the USTA Junior Hard Court singles. At age 13, he won the Fiesta Bowl 16s. In July 1987, at the age of 15, Chang won another USTA Junior Hard Court singles, beating Pete Sampras in the final, and a month later, in Kalamazoo, he won America’s most prestigious junior event, the United States Nationals U18s tournament, beating Jim Courier in the final. This victory earned him a wildcard for the U.S. Open.

===Professional career===
On 1 September 1987, at age 15, Chang became the youngest player to win a main draw match at the US Open when he defeated Paul McNamee in four sets (6–3, 6–7, 6–4, 6-4) in the first round. A month later, he reached the semifinals at Scottsdale, Arizona, to become the youngest player to reach the semifinal stage of a top-level professional tournament. In 1988, aged 16 years and seven months, he won his first top-level singles title at San Francisco, defeating Johan Kriek in the final. During his title run, Chang registed a 6-4, 6-0 win over Mikael Pernfors, the 1986 French Open finalist who just the previous week had beaten Andre Agassi in the finals of Los Angeles.

Chang&#x27;s most significant &quot;youngest-ever&quot; record came in 1989 when he won the French Open at the age of , to become the youngest male player ever to win a Grand Slam title. He defeated Stefan Edberg in a five-set final, 6–1, 3–6, 4–6, 6–4, 6–2. Chang thus became the first American man to win the French Open since Tony Trabert in 1955, and the first American man to win a Grand Slam since 1984. His 1989 French Open tournament performance is equally remembered for an epic fourth-round encounter with Ivan Lendl, who was then the world&#x27;s No. 1-ranked player, was the reigning Australian Open champion, and was a three-time former French Open champion.

In 1988, Chang had been easily beaten by Lendl in an exhibition match held in Des Moines, Iowa. After the match, Lendl advised Chang, &quot;First off, you&#x27;ve got no serve. And you&#x27;ve certainly got no second serve. You can&#x27;t hurt me. You can run but you better develop a weapon to survive out here&quot;, all weaknesses that Chang worked to improve on. At the 1989 French Open, Lendl appeared to be on the way to beating Chang after taking the first two sets 6–4, 6–4 and breaking Chang&#x27;s serve in his opening service game of the third set. However, Chang broke back immediately and went on to claim the third set, 6–3. During the fourth set, Chang experienced a severe attack of leg cramps, and though he won the set to level the match, he considered retiring from the match while up 2–1 in the fifth set. He later said that he felt &quot;an unbelievable conviction in my heart&quot; not to give up, and decided to finish the match.

Chang adopted some unusual tactics in an attempt to overcome his cramps. Those tactics included hitting shots high into the air (known as &quot;moon balls&quot;) to slow the match down and going for more winners in order to shorten the points. The success of these tactics caused Lendl to lose his rhythm and also prompted him to swear at the umpire and the crowd, especially after losing a key point in the fifth set when Chang shocked him by delivering an under-arm serve. On match point, Chang stood just behind the service line while waiting to receive Lendl&#x27;s second serve. The tactic worked, as Lendl produced a double-fault to give Chang the victory, 4–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3, 6–3, in 4 hours and 37 minutes.

Chang subsequently defeated Ronald Agénor in the quarter-final and Andrei Chesnokov in the semi-final. Then seven days after his match against Lendl, after beating Stefan Edberg in five sets, Chang went on to lift the &quot;Coupe des Mousquetaires&quot;, becoming the youngest men&#x27;s champion in Grand Slam history. Chang&#x27;s match against Lendl was played on June 5, 1989, just one day after the height of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. Chang has frequently noted the impact of the massacre when recalling his French Open victory:


Chang became the first American man to win the French Open since Tony Trabert in 1955, and the first American man to win a Grand Slam since 1984. In August 1989, Chang became the youngest player to be ranked in the world&#x27;s top 5.

Chang would defeat Lendl again in near-duplicate fashion, 2–6, 4–6, 6–4, 7–6 (7–5), 9–7 in a 4-hour, 42-minute semi-final match at the Grand Slam Cup on December 14, 1991.

Chang met Edberg in the semifinals of the US Open in 1992; this time, Edberg won in five sets, 6–7, 7–5, 7–6, 5–7, 6–4. The five-hour, 26-minute match is the second longest in US Open history. Chang reached three further Grand Slam finals after his 1989 French Open triumph, losing the 1995 French Open final to Thomas Muster, the 1996 Australian Open final to Boris Becker, and the 1996 US Open final to Pete Sampras. In the 1995 French Open, he defeated Michael Stich and then two-time defending champion Sergi Bruguera in the semifinals in straight sets, eventually losing to Muster. In both the 1996 Australian and U.S. Opens, he defeated Andre Agassi in the semifinals in straight sets; a win over Sampras at the U.S. Open would have made Chang the no. 1 player in the world. In the 1997 U.S. Open, he was the odds-on favorite to win after Sampras was upset by Petr Korda; however, Chang lost to eventual champion Patrick Rafter in the semifinals in straight sets.

Chang was the first player to be beaten by Roger Federer in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, at the 2000 Australian Open. He was also the second player to be beaten by Andy Roddick in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, in the second round of the French Open in 2001.

Chang was introduced to tennis by his father Joe, who was his first coach. During his rise in 1989 (including his French Open title), he was coached by José Higueras. For much of his professional career, he was coached by his older brother Carl Chang, who also played in several doubles tournaments with him in the early 1990s.

Chang retired from the professional tour in 2003. During his career, he won a total of 34 top-level professional singles titles. His final top-level title was won in 2000 at Los Angeles. His total career prize-money earnings was US$19,145,632. His career-high singles ranking was world no. 2 in 1996, following his US Open finals performance. He was a year-end top-ten player for six consecutive years in the 1990s (1992–1997), a feat matched in the decade only by Pete Sampras. He is one of a few players to win ATP titles in three different decades. His three Indian Wells Masters titles was an ATP record which stood for 15 years, before being eclipsed by Roger Federer in 2012.

Chang&#x27;s success marked the start of an era in which a new generation of American players—which also included Pete Sampras, Jim Courier, and Andre Agassi—would come to dominate the game.

===International play===
Chang was a key member of the US team which won the Davis Cup in 1990. In the semifinals in Austria, his dramatic comeback from two-sets down against Horst Skoff, 3–6, 6–7, 6–4, 6–4, 6–3, led the US into its first Davis Cup final since 1984. Chang went on to defeat Darren Cahill in straight sets, as the US defeated Australia in the final. He was also on the US team which won the World Team Cup in 1993. His best performance in the year-end singles championship came in 1995, when he defeated Muster, Jim Courier, and then dominated Pete Sampras in the semifinals, before losing in the final to Boris Becker.

Chang represented the US in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, reaching the second round before being eliminated by Jaime Oncins. He chose to skip the 1996 Summer Olympics despite the fact that the event was held in Atlanta and that he would have been the tournament&#x27;s number-one seed (the singles&#x27; gold medal was won by Andre Agassi). Chang participated in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where he was eliminated in the first round by Sébastien Lareau.

<text>Pamela Jones, commonly known as PJ, is the creator and was editor of &quot;Groklaw&quot;, a website that covered legal news of interest to the free and open-source software community. Jones is an open source advocate who previously trained and worked as a paralegal.

Jones&#x27; articles have appeared in &quot;Linux Journal&quot;, LWN, &quot;LinuxWorld Magazine&quot;, &quot;Linux Today&quot;, and LinuxWorld.com. She also wrote a monthly opinion column for the UK print publication &quot;Linux User and Developer&quot;. She is one of the contributors to the book &quot;Open Sources 2.0: The Continuing Evolution&quot;.

In 2010, the Electronic Frontier Foundation awarded the Pioneer award to &quot;Pamela Jones and the Groklaw Website&quot;
for &quot;Legal Blogging&quot;.

== Grok projects ==

=== Groklaw ===

Jones had a website, Groklaw, which covered open source legal issues, notably the SCO–Linux disputes. The website started as a blog but grew from there. 

Groklaw covered the various lawsuits involving the SCO Group in detail but also covered general legal news of interest to the Free Software and Open Source community. The site won numerous awards, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award in 2010 and the American Bar Association Journal Blawg 100 in 2012.

Groklaw shut down on August 20, 2013, following the Lavabit email shutdown, because there was &quot;no way to do Groklaw without email&quot;, and the inability to privately collaborate without it: &quot;I can&#x27;t do Groklaw without your input.&quot;

=== Grokline ===
Jones also launched Grokline, a Unix ownership timeline project, in February 2004.

=== Grokdoc ===
Grokdoc was a Groklaw spinoff whose original goal was to create a useful manual on basic Linux tasks that new Linux users will find simple and clear and easy to follow, using what they learn from their study. The site now also supports many other collaborative projects which benefit from its wiki-like structure.

== Use of initials ==
Jones reveals very little personal information, as she considers it private and has expressed from the beginning a strong preference for avoiding fame. Here are the reasons she gave in the early days for using just her initials:

I originally wanted to stay anonymous, in a sense, by just saying PJ. Eventually media attention and other factors made it impossible to remain just PJ but I would have if I could have. I have no desire to be famous, for one thing. And I have been creatively influenced by Scott McCloud&#x27;s work. He points out in &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; (p. 45–51) in a section on iconic representation that people respond most strongly to a drawing of a character that simplifies to the point that anyone can identify with the character. I guess I was hoping for that effect. In other words, I was hoping people could assume whatever they wanted and just focus on what I said, rather than on who was saying it. For that reason, I chose PJ, because it could be anyone, either sex, any nationality, anyone and no one in particular. I wanted participation by anyone interested in the SCO story. No politics. Nothing extraneous. Just an effort to locate and provide evidence that could be useful. I knew the community could answer SCO, if they just knew what was needed. And they have.

<doc id="391839" wikidata="Q7593042" url="?curid=391839" title="St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate">
<text>St Ethelburga-the-Virgin within Bishopsgate is a Church of England church in the City of London, located on Bishopsgate near Liverpool Street station.

One of the few surviving medieval City churches in London, the foundation date of the church is unknown, but it was first recorded in 1250 as the church of St Adelburga the Virgin.

The church was rebuilt around 1411 and some of this material remains, notably in the south arcade. 

The church was severely damaged by an IRA bomb in 1993. Following rebuilding and restoration it re-opened as a Centre for Reconciliation and Peace.

==History==
This structure is a rare survivor of the medieval City churches that were mostly destroyed during the Great Fire of London in 1666. It is dedicated to St Ethelburga, a 7th-century abbess of Barking Abbey; she was the sister of Saint Erkenwald, a Bishop of London. Its foundation date is unknown, but it was first recorded in 1250 as the church of &quot;St Adelburga-the-Virgin&quot;. The dedication to &quot;-the-Virgin&quot; was dropped in Puritan times but was later restored.

The church was rebuilt in the 15th century – possibly around 1411 – and a small square bell turret was added in 1775. A weathervane was added in 1671. In order to raise revenue for the church, whose parish covered just three acres (1.2  ha), a wooden porch was built over its exterior in the 16th century to house two shops. It underwent major changes in 1932, when Bishopsgate was controversially widened. The shops were demolished and the porch dismantled, revealing the façade of the church for the first time in centuries.

It suffered modest bomb damage during the Blitz of the Second World War and was restored in 1953. In 1993, the church was half destroyed when a massive IRA bomb exploded 7 metres from the church, devastating Bishopsgate and causing an estimated £350 million worth of damage. An evangelical faction of the Church of England proposed to demolish St Ethelburga&#x27;s in the aftermath but, following a sustained public outcry, it was rebuilt to its original plan, though much changed inside.

==Description==
The church&#x27;s tiny interior comprises a nave and aisle divided by an arcade. Most of the original fittings were destroyed by the 1993 bombing although they were not as old as the church. Dating from the early 20th century, they were the work of Ninian Comper. One of the more notable surviving elements is the curious 19th-century font, which is inscribed with one of the longest known palindromes, written in Greek: , which translates as &quot;Cleanse [your] transgressions, not only [your] face&quot;.

The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950, and its reconstruction retains the listing.

==Centre for Reconciliation and Peace==
St Ethelburga&#x27;s Centre for Reconciliation and Peace is a non-profit charity which aims to build relationships across divisions of conflict, culture and religion. Its work includes: a multi-faith conflict resilience programme (faith leaders working together to become more intelligent in their responses to conflict); community reconciliation (building a coalition for peace within the North and South Sudanese diaspora in London); the Narrative Practitioners Forum (promoting the use of narrative and personal story for building empathy between people with different backgrounds); Re-awakening the Sacred (a secular and spiritual multi-disciplinary enquiry into bringing a deeper sense of meaning into the earth, environment, leadership, economics and business etc.); an MA in reconciliation at Winchester University; and several strands of cultural exchange work mentoring young adults into social action leadership roles.

It also runs a certificated three-day course in conflict coaching aimed at anyone dealing with workplace or personal conflict.

The centre also works with a social enterprise, Seasoned Events, for building/venue hire purposes.

Every year the Centre organises a 10km walk, &#x27;The Ethelburga Walk&#x27;, which links two historic sites associated with the St Ethelburga of Barking: Barking Abbey and St Ethelburga&#x27;s Centre.

St Ethelburga&#x27;s is a partner in the community of the Cross of Nails.

==Notable people associated with the church==
*Blessed John Larke, Rector (1504–1544) who was martyred for denying the royal supremacy in matters spiritual.
*Henry Hudson, explorer, took communion with his crew before setting out in search of the Northwest Passage, 1607.
*Charles Viner (1678-1756) married in the church in 1699.
*John Medows Rodwell, Rector (1843–1900) who made the first reliable rendering of the Qur&#x27;an into English (1861).
*William Geikie-Cobb, Rector (1900–1941) who achieved notoriety by marrying many divorced persons in the church. 
*Singers Webster Booth and Anne Ziegler (born Irené Frances Eastwood) had their marriage blessed by W. F. Geikie-Cobb in a special ceremony for divorced persons on 5 November 1938.

<text>Cathare is a goat&#x27;s milk cheese from the Languedoc-Roussillon region of France. The cheese comes in flat discs whose face is covered in charcoal powder with the Occitan cross inscribed. Under the rind, Cathare is pure white with a soft, creamy texture. Its goat-milk flavor intensifies as it ages, and reaches its prime after two to three weeks, which makes it typically unavailable in the United States, due to the Food and Drug Administration&#x27;s stance that raw milk soft cheeses can pose a health risk. The sale of raw milk cheese aged under 60 days is illegal in the United States.

<text>This is a list of towns in New Zealand. The term &quot;town&quot; has no current statutory meaning in New Zealand, the few &quot;Town Districts&quot; having been abolished in 1989 or earlier. 

The list includes most urban areas in New Zealand. Those deemed urban areas by Statistics New Zealand (under either the NZSCA92 or SSGA18 standard) are marked with an asterisk. Isolated towns, such as Ashburton and Levin, are usually parts of a local government &quot;District&quot; (which occasionally has the same name), but the rest, such as Wainuiomata, Pukerua Bay, and Port Chalmers, are within city council boundaries, and are often referred to as suburbs of their respective cities. Many were boroughs during most of the twentieth century, and some earlier.

<doc id="391850" wikidata="Q1017532" url="?curid=391850" title="Bushy Park">
<text>Bushy Park in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames is the second largest of London&#x27;s Royal Parks, at in area, after Richmond Park. The park, most of which is open to the public, is immediately north of Hampton Court Palace and Hampton Court Park and is a few minutes&#x27; walk from the west side of Kingston Bridge. It is surrounded by Teddington, Hampton, Hampton Hill and Hampton Wick and is mainly within the post towns of Hampton and Teddington, those of East Molesey and Kingston upon Thames taking the remainder.

In September 2014, most of it was designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest together with Hampton Court Park and Hampton Court Golf Course as &quot;Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI&quot;.
The park is listed at Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==

The area now known as Bushy Park has been settled for at least the past 4,000 years: the earliest archaeological records that have been found on the site date back to the Bronze Age. There is also evidence that the area was used in the medieval period for agricultural purposes.

When Henry VIII took over Hampton Court Palace from Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1529, the King named three parks that make up modern-day Bushy Park and a small area beside: Hare Warren, Middle Park and Bushy Park. A keen hunter, he established them as deer-hunting grounds.

His successors, perhaps less involved in traditional sporting activities, added a number of picturesque features, including the Longford River, a canal built on the orders of Charles I to provide water to Hampton Court, and the park&#x27;s various ponds. This period also saw the construction of the main thoroughfare, Chestnut Avenue, which runs from Park Road in Teddington to the Lion Gate entrance to Hampton Court Palace in Hampton Court Road. This avenue and the Arethusa &#x27;Diana&#x27; Fountain were designed by Sir Christopher Wren as a grand approach to Hampton Court Palace.

The park has long been popular with locals, but also attracts visitors from further afield. From the mid-19th century until World War II, Londoners came here to celebrate Chestnut Sunday and to see the abundant blossoming of the trees along Chestnut Avenue. The customs were discovered and resurrected in 1993 by Colin and Mu Pain.

Among those who served as ranger (an honorary position, long including residence at Bushy House) was King William IV, while Duke of Clarence (1797–1830). To ensure his consort Queen Adelaide, could remain at their long-time home after his death, he immediately appointed her as his successor as ranger (1830–1849), after whose death the position was left vacant and fell into disuse.

During World War I, Bushy Park housed the King&#x27;s Canadian Hospital in the modern &quot;White Lodge&quot;, and between the wars it hosted a camp for undernourished children.

During World War II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower planned the D-Day landings from Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) at Camp Griffiss in the Park. A memorial by Carlos Rey dedicated to the Allied troops who fell on D-Day now marks the spot where General Eisenhower&#x27;s tent stood. The nearby Eisenhower House is named in the General&#x27;s honour, and Shaef Gate is named after the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force.

From May 1942, a group of temporary buildings on the north-east of the park, codenamed &quot;Widewing&quot;, hosted the &quot;de facto&quot; headquarters of the US Eighth Air Force under Generals Carl Spaatz and, later, Ira Eaker. Spaatz went on to command the US Army Air Forces throughout the European Theatre of Operations (ETO) and in early 1944 became commander of the newly formed US Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF) in Europe at &quot;Widewing&quot;. Also known by its US Army code, AAF-586, Camp Griffiss/&quot;Widewing&quot; was often confused with the wartime headquarters of VIII Fighter Command (part of Eighth Air Force) at &quot;Bushey&quot; Hall, near Watford, Hertfordshire. The park also had a runway for planes. 

==The park today==
Originally created for royal sports, Bushy Park is now home to Teddington Rugby Club and four cricket clubs – Teddington Town Cricket Club, Hampton Wick Royal Cricket Club, Teddington Cricket Club, and Hampton Hill Cricket Club. Teddington Hockey Club was based in the Park until it moved to Teddington School; from 1871 onwards, the rules of the modern game of field hockey were largely devised at Bushy.
It also has fishing and model boating ponds, horse rides, formal plantations of trees and other plants, wildlife conservation areas, and herds of both red deer and fallow deer.

The park also contains several lodges and cottages: Bushy House, housing the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at the Teddington end, and the Royal Paddocks and two areas of allotments – the Royal Paddocks Allotments at Hampton Wick and the Bushy Park Allotments at Hampton Hill.

The original Parkrun began in Bushy Park in October 2004, initially as the &#x27;Bushy Park Time Trial&#x27;, then Bushy Parkrun. It is a free, timed, 5K run that takes place every Saturday morning at 9am, attracting up to 1,500 runners each week. Events also take place annually on Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Day.

As part of an upgrade of the park facilities, the new Pheasantry Café was added, and the restored and largely reconstructed Upper Lodge Water Gardens were opened in October 2009. The work was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

==Flora and fauna==

Bushy Park is part of the &quot;Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI&quot; designated in September 2014 for its range of semi-natural habitats such as acid and neutral grassland, scrubland, woodland, and wood pasture. There is an internationally important assemblage of invertebrates due to the mosaic of habitats including two hundred veteran trees. A fungus gnat – a type of fly – new to the UK was found in the Waterhouse Woodland Gardens by entomologist Peter Chandler and identified as &quot;Grzegorzekia bushyae&quot; and also known as the Bushy Gnat. This fly has since been found in a forest in south-east France.

==Transport==
The closest railway stations are Hampton Court in East Molesey to the south, Hampton Wick to the east, Teddington and Fulwell to the north, and Hampton to the west. All are within a 10- to 20-minute walk.

Transport for London bus routes 111, 216, and 411 pass the Hampton Court Gate on Hampton Court Road (the main southern entrance to the Park).

R70, R68, and 285 buses stop near the two Hampton Hill Gates off the High Street, while the R68 also serves the Blandford Road Gate (next to the NPL on Hampton Road, Teddington) before continuing to Hampton Court Green via Hampton Hill.

To the north, the main Teddington gate on Park Road, and a second on Sandy Lane, are only served by a half-hourly 481 bus service. But, the main gate is best reached, either on foot or by bike, from Teddington&#x27;s town centre, which is served by the 33, 281, 285, 481, R68, and X26 services, via Park Road, or from the railway station.

The main north and south gates, connected by the Chestnut Avenue private highway, provide vehicle access to traffic from 6.30am until dusk (or to 7.00pm in the winter months). There is one straight road through the Park between the two gates but cars are no longer permitted to drive straight through the Park, and can only access respective car parks from either gate.

There is 24/7 bicycle access via the main avenue between the north and south gates and cycle paths/restricted access private highways across the park.

<text>Vera-Ellen (born Vera-Ellen Rohe; February 16, 1921 – August 30, 1981) was an American dancer, actress, and singer. She is remembered for her solo performances as well as her work with partners Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Danny Kaye, and Donald O&#x27;Connor. She is best known for her starring roles in &quot;On the Town&quot; (1949) with Kelly and &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954) with Kaye.

==Early life==
Vera-Ellen Rohe was born in Norwood, Ohio, to Martin F. Rohe, a piano dealer, and Alma C. Westmeier. Both were descended from German immigrants. Her mother dreamed she would have a girl named Vera-Ellen, including the hyphen.

She began dancing at age 10 and quickly became proficient. One of her fellow dance students at Hessler Studio of Dancing was Doris Day. At age 13, she was a winner on the &quot;Major Bowes Amateur Hour&quot; and embarked upon a professional career.

==Career==
===Stage===
In 1939, she made her Broadway debut in the Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein musical &quot;Very Warm for May&quot;. She became one of the youngest Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall. This led to roles on Broadway in &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;, &quot;By Jupiter&quot;, and &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot;, where she was spotted by Samuel Goldwyn, who cast her opposite Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo in the 1945 film &quot;Wonder Man&quot;.

===Dubbing===
Starting in 1945 with &quot;Wonder Man&quot;, her first film, her singing was dubbed. However, the Decca Broadway Original Cast Album of 1943&#x27;s revival of &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; has two vocals by Vera-Ellen, &quot;I Feel at Home with You&quot; and &quot;You Always Love the Same Girl,&quot; both duets with Chester Stratton. Her style is of a comic soubrette.

===Film===
She danced with Gene Kelly in the Hollywood musicals &quot;Words and Music&quot; and &quot;On the Town&quot;, while also appearing in the last Marx Brothers film, &quot;Love Happy&quot;. She received top billing alongside Fred Astaire in the musicals &quot;Three Little Words&quot; and &quot;The Belle of New York&quot;. She had a co-starring role with Donald O&#x27;Connor in the Ethel Merman vehicle &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;. She also starred in the 1951 musical comedy &quot;Happy Go Lovely&quot; alongside David Niven and Cesar Romero. Vera-Ellen&#x27;s penultimate film role was the 1954 blockbuster hit &quot;White Christmas&quot;, co-starring with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, and Rosemary Clooney. She starred in only one more film, the 1957 British production &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Happy&quot;.

===Television===
Vera-Ellen was a frequent guest on US variety programming in the mid-to-late 1950s. Her final performances were on a November 22, 1958, television episode of &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; and a February 14, 1959, broadcast of &quot;The Dinah Shore Show&quot;. Following that, Vera-Ellen retired from performing.

==Personal life==
According to Hollywood chronicler Brian Cronin, what he describes as Vera-Ellen&#x27;s &quot;extremely thin&quot; appearance led to rumors during her career that she had an eating disorder. A rumor that her neck was always covered during the filming of &quot;White Christmas&quot; because of wrinkling caused by supposed anorexia persists to this day. However, pictures and video taken at the same time show her neck appearing normal and undamaged. A friend, Bill Dennington, who knew her during the last 20 years of her life, dismissed the story about her neck and added that he hated &quot;that people think of her as &#x27;the dancer with anorexia&#x27; and not just the fabulous dancer who has been so overlooked.&quot;

Her niece by marriage, Ileana Rothschild, born in 1967, remembered that her aunt &quot;never stopped taking dance classes and maintained her slim figure always.&quot; She was also an &quot;avid swimmer&quot;, who used a swimming program to recover from a mild stroke late in her life. According to Rothschild, she had no eating disorder.

Vera-Ellen was married twice. Her first husband was a fellow dancer, Robert Hightower, to whom she was married from February 1941 to November 1946. Her second husband was oilman Victor Bennett Rothschild. They were married from 1954 to 1966 when they divorced. While married to Rothschild, she gave birth to a daughter, Victoria Ellen, who died in 1963 at three months from SIDS. Following the death of her only child, she withdrew from public life.

==Death==
Vera-Ellen died at the Los Angeles County General Hospital on August 30, 1981, of ovarian cancer. She was 60 years old.

<text>Kensington Palace is a royal residence situated within Kensington Gardens in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London, England. It has served as a residence for the British royal family since the 17th century and is currently the official London residence of several royals, including the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke and Duchess of Kent, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, and Princess Eugenie alongside her husband, Jack Brooksbank, and their two sons. The term &quot;Kensington Palace&quot; is often used as a metonym for the offices of the royals who reside there.

Today, the State Rooms of Kensington Palace are open to the public and are managed by Historic Royal Palaces, an independent charity that operates without public funding. The palace&#x27;s offices and private living quarters remain the responsibility of the Royal Household. Additionally, Kensington Palace showcases numerous paintings and other artifacts from the Royal Collection.

==History==

===King William III and Queen Mary II===
Kensington Palace was originally a two-storey Jacobean mansion built by Sir George Coppin in 1605 in the village of Kensington.

Shortly after William and Mary assumed the throne as joint monarchs in 1689, they began searching for a residence better suited for the comfort of the asthmatic William. Whitehall Palace was too near the River Thames, with its fog and floods, for William&#x27;s fragile health. 
In the summer of 1689, William and Mary bought the property, then known as Nottingham House, from the Secretary of State Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham, 7th Earl of Winchilsea, for £20,000. They instructed Sir Christopher Wren, Surveyor of the King&#x27;s Works, to begin an immediate expansion of the house. In order to save time and money, Wren kept the structure intact and added a three-storey pavilion at each of the four corners, providing more accommodation for the King and Queen and their attendants. The Queen&#x27;s Apartments were in the north-west pavilion and the King&#x27;s in the south-east.

Wren re-oriented the house to face west, building north and south wings to flank the approach, made into a proper cour d&#x27;honneur that was entered through an archway surmounted by a clock tower. The palace was surrounded by straight cut solitary lawns, and formal stately gardens, laid out with paths and flower beds at right angles, in the Dutch garden fashion. The royal court took residence in the palace shortly before Christmas 1689. For the next seventy years, Kensington Palace was the favoured residence of British monarchs, although the official seat of the Court was and remains at St. James&#x27;s Palace, which has not been the actual royal residence in London since the 17th century.

Additional improvements soon after included Queen Mary&#x27;s extension of her apartments, by building the Queen&#x27;s Gallery. After a fire in 1691, the King&#x27;s Staircase was rebuilt in marble and a Guard Chamber was constructed, facing the foot of the stairs. William had constructed the South Front, to the design of Nicholas Hawksmoor, which included the Kings&#x27; Gallery where he hung many works from his picture collection. Mary II died of smallpox in the palace in 1694. In 1702, William suffered a fall from a horse at Hampton Court and was brought to Kensington Palace, where he died shortly afterwards from pneumonia.

===Queen Anne===

After William III&#x27;s death, the palace became the residence of Queen Anne. She had Christopher Wren complete the extensions that William and Mary had begun, resulting in the section known as the Queen&#x27;s Apartments, with the Queen&#x27;s Entrance, and the plainly decorated Wren designed staircase, that featured shallow steps so that Anne could walk down gracefully. These were primarily used by the Queen to give access between the private apartments and gardens.

Queen Anne&#x27;s most notable contribution to the palace were the gardens. She commissioned the Hawksmoor-designed Orangery, modified by John Vanbrugh, that was built for her in 1704. The level of decoration of the interior, including carved detail by Grinling Gibbons, reflects its intended use, not just as a greenhouse, but as a place for entertaining. A magnificent baroque parterre, with sections of clipped scrolling designs punctuated by trees formally clipped into cones, was laid out by Henry Wise, the royal gardener.

Kensington Palace was the setting of the final argument between Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, and Queen Anne. The Duchess, who was known for being outspoken and manipulative, was jealous of the attention the Queen was giving to Abigail Masham, Baroness Masham. Along with the previous insensitive acts of the Duchess after the death of Anne&#x27;s husband, Prince George of Denmark, who had died at Kensington Palace in October 1708, their friendship came to an abrupt end on 6 April 1710, with the two seeing each other for the last time after an argument in the Queen&#x27;s Closet. Queen Anne died at Kensington Palace on 1 August 1714.

===King George I and King George II===
George I spent lavishly on new royal apartments, creating three new state rooms known as the Privy Chamber, the Cupola Room and the Withdrawing Room. He hired the unknown William Kent in 1722 to decorate the state rooms, which he did with elaborately painted trompe-l&#x27;œil ceilings and walls. The Cupola Room was Kent&#x27;s first commission for the King. The octagonal coffering in the domed ceiling was painted in gold and blue, and terminated in a flat panel decorated with the Star of the Order of the Garter. The walls and woodwork were painted brown and gold to contrast with the white marble pilasters, doorways and niches which were surmounted with gilded statuary.

George I was pleased with his work, and between 1722, and 1727, Kent oversaw the decoration and picture hanging for all of the royal apartments at Kensington Palace. Kent&#x27;s final commission was the King&#x27;s Grand Staircase which he painted with 45 intriguing courtiers from the Georgian court, including the King&#x27;s Turkish servants Mahomet and Mustapha, Peter &#x27;the wild boy&#x27; as well as himself along with his mistress. King George I enlarged the palace with the addition of an apartment, built on the north-west side, to house his mistress, Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal.

The last reigning monarch to use Kensington Palace was George II, who did not undertake any major structural changes to the palace during his reign, and left the running of the palace to his wife Caroline of Ansbach. At the request of the Queen, Charles Bridgeman, successor to Henry Wise as royal gardener, swept away the outmoded parterres and redesigned Kensington Gardens in a form that is still recognisable today: his remaining features are the Serpentine, the basin called the Round Pond, and the Broad Walk. After the death of his wife, George II neglected many rooms and the palace fell into disrepair. King George II died at Kensington Palace on 25 October 1760.

===Notable palace residents===
====19th century====
With the accession of George III in 1760, Kensington Palace was only used for minor royalty. The sixth son of George III, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, was allocated apartments in the south-west corner of Kensington Palace in 1805 known as Apartment 1. He was interested in the arts and science and amassed a huge library that filled ten rooms and comprised over fifty thousand volumes. He had a large number of clocks, and a variety of singing birds that were free to fly around his apartments. He was elected as president of the Royal Society and gave receptions in his apartments at Kensington Palace to men of science. The expense they incurred induced him to resign the presidency, as he preferred to employ the money in making additions to his library.

The Duke of Sussex caused quite a scandal when he married twice in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772, because it had not been approved by the King. His second wife, Cecilia Underwood, Duchess of Inverness, was never titled or recognised as the Duchess of Sussex. However, she was created Duchess of Inverness in her own right in 1840. The Duke died at Kensington Palace in 1843. As he had lived beyond his means and amassed substantial debts, his possessions, including the library, were sold after his death. The Duchess of Inverness continued to reside at Kensington Palace until her death in 1873.

Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III, was allocated two floors of rooms in the south-east corner of the palace, below the State Apartments, which he renovated for his use. The apartments were next to his near-blind sister Princess Sophia. His daughter, Alexandrina Victoria, was born on 24 May 1819, and her christening conducted in the Cupola Room the following month. The Duke of Kent and Strathearn died nine months after the birth of his daughter.

She grew up in the confines of the palace in an unhappy and lonely childhood as a result of the Kensington System adopted by her mother, Victoria, Duchess of Kent, and the domineering Sir John Conroy, her mother&#x27;s comptroller of the household. Princess Sophia fell under the sway of Conroy, who took advantage of her senility and blindness. She frequently served as his spy on the Kensington household, as well as on her two elder brothers. Conroy squandered most of her money until she died in 1848, at Kensington Palace.
In 1837, Princess Alexandrina Victoria was awakened to be told that her uncle, King William IV, had died and that she was now queen. She took the regnal name of &quot;Victoria&quot; and held her first privy council in the Red Saloon at the palace. The Queen promptly moved to Buckingham Palace. She granted rooms in Kensington Palace to her family and retired retainers, who included the Duke and Duchess of Teck, parents of Queen Mary (great-grandmother of King Charles III), who was born at Kensington Palace on 26 May 1867. In 1873, Princess Louise (then Marchioness of Lorne, later Duchess of Argyll), resided in the apartment with her husband, the Marquess of Lorne (later the Duke of Argyll), departing after he was appointed Governor General of Canada for Rideau Hall.

The couple returned after his tenure, and Louise used her art studio at the apartments to design and sculpt the Statue of Queen Victoria, Kensington Palace. The apartment became her primary residence upon her widowhood in 1914 before her death in 1939. In 1955, the apartment was given to the widowed Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, and her children until her death in 1969. Louise&#x27;s younger sister, Princess Beatrice, was given by Queen Victoria the apartments once occupied by the Queen and her mother below the State Apartments.

====20th century====
During World War I, George V allowed a number of rooms in the palace to be used by those working for Irish POWs and Irish soldiers at the front, and decreed that its royal inhabitants adhere to the same rations as everyone else. The royal inhabitants now included Princess Helena, Duchess of Albany; Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone; and Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone. In 1921, upon widowhood, Victoria, Marchioness of Milford Haven, moved into a grace-and-favour apartment at Kensington Palace. During this period, her grandson, Prince Philip, lived with her at times as she was in charge of his education. As a result of the number of royal relatives residing there during the 1920s and 1930s, Edward VIII called the palace &quot;the aunt heap.&quot;
Kensington Palace was severely damaged during the Blitz of 1940. It was hit by an incendiary bomb that exploded in the north side of Clock Court, damaging many of the surrounding buildings including the State Apartments, particularly the Queen&#x27;s Apartments. The Headquarters of Personnel Section occupied Apartment 34, and as a result the garden was overrun with anti-aircraft guns, sandbags and trenches. Repairs to the palace were not completed for several years, but after the war, Prince Philip stayed with his grandmother, Victoria, Marchioness of Milford Haven in the lead-up to his 1947 marriage with Princess Elizabeth, later to become Queen Elizabeth II.

With the bombing damage and the deaths of Princess Louise and Princess Beatrice, the palace entered a period of neglect. During the 1950s, residents of the palace included the Master of the Horse, Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort, who had married Lady Mary Cambridge - a niece of Queen Mary as the daughter of Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge, Sir Alan Lascelles, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s private secretary and Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, who lived in the palace until her death in 1981.

In 1955, the widowed Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, moved into Apartment 1, with her children, which had been vacant since Princess Louise&#x27;s death in 1939. It was at this time that the apartment was divided and Apartment 1A created. The stylish Duchess of Kent continued to live in the apartment until her death at Kensington Palace of a brain tumour in 1968.

Following their wedding on 6 May 1960, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, sister of Queen Elizabeth II, and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, moved into Apartment 10, while they set about transforming the much larger Apartment 1A to new designs. In 1960, Kensington Palace was under the auspices of the Department of the Environment. The renovation had to be carried out under the strictest of budgets, with the eventual costs coming in at £85,000, approximately £1.5 million today. By 1962, the whole interior had been gutted. All the floors, except the attic floor, were removed to deal with rising damp. The resulting modern apartment consisted of the main reception rooms, three principal bedrooms and dressing rooms, three principal bathrooms, the nursery accommodation, nine staff bedrooms, four staff bathrooms, two staff kitchens and two staff sitting rooms.

Twenty ancillary rooms included a linen store, a luggage room, a drying room, a glass pantry and a photographic dark room for Lord Snowdon. The house in 18th century style, had a modern colour palette, with the bold use of colours including Margaret&#x27;s favourites, pink and kingfisher blue. The house was largely designed by Snowdon and Princess Margaret with the assistance of the theatre designer Carl Toms, one-time assistant to Oliver Messel, Lord Snowdon&#x27;s uncle, and a close friend of the royal couple. The royal couple moved into Apartment 1A on 4 March 1963, prior to the birth of their daughter, Lady Sarah, who was born at the palace the following year.

Prince and Princess Richard of Gloucester, later Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, moved into Apartment 1 after their marriage in 1972, the 21-room house previously occupied by Princess Marina, where they subsequently raised their three children. In 1994, after the Gloucesters had to give up their country home, Barnwell Manor, for financial reasons, they moved the Duke&#x27;s aged mother Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, from Barnwell to Kensington Palace where she died in her sleep on 29 October 2004 at age 102. She holds the record as the oldest person in the history of the British royal family.

The Queen gave the keys to the five-bedroom, five-reception grace-and-favour Apartment 10 to Prince and Princess Michael of Kent on the occasion of their marriage in 1978. Their children, Lord Frederick Windsor and Lady Gabriella Kingston, were raised at the residence. In 2008, there was controversy when it was claimed that the couple paid a rent of only £70 per week, though they fulfilled no official duties on behalf of the Queen. The British Monarchy Media Centre denied these reports and stated that, &quot;The Queen is paying the rent for Prince and Princess Michael of Kent&#x27;s apartment at a commercial rate of £120,000 annually from her own private funds... This rent payment by The Queen is in recognition of the Royal engagements and work for various charities which Prince and Princess Michael of Kent have undertaken at their own expense, and without any public funding.&quot;

It was announced that from 2010, that Prince and Princess Michael would begin paying rent of £120,000 a year out of their own funds to continue living in the apartment. In 1996, Prince Michael&#x27;s older brother, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and his wife Katharine moved into Wren House on the Kensington Palace estate.
In 1981, in the part of the palace that King George I had built for his mistress, the Duchess of Kendal, Apartments 8 and 9 were combined to create the London residence of the newly married Prince of Wales and his wife, Diana, Princess of Wales. It remained the official residence of the Princess after their divorce until her death. Her sons, Princes William and Harry, were raised in Kensington Palace and went to local nursery and pre-preparatory schools in Notting Hill, which is a short drive away. According to Andrew Morton, the palace was a &quot;children&#x27;s paradise&quot; with its long passageways, a helicopter pad, and many outdoor gardens, including one on the roof where the family spent many hours.

Several notable courtiers live or have lived at The Old Barracks building, on the southern end of the palace. Notable residents include: Paul Burrell, Princess Diana&#x27;s butler; Sir Miles Hunt-Davies, Private Secretary to Prince Philip; Jane, Lady Fellowes, Diana&#x27;s sister, and her husband Robert Fellowes, Baron Fellowes, Private Secretary to the Queen. Diana&#x27;s interview with Martin Bashir for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; programme was recorded in Diana&#x27;s sitting room at the palace. In February 1987, a thief wearing a ski mask hit police guards with a hammer while in the gardens but did not get inside the palace, where Prince Charles, Diana and other royals were sleeping.

Upon Diana&#x27;s death on 31 August 1997, the gates at Kensington Palace became the focus of public mourning with over one million bouquets, reaching deep in places, placed as tribute before them stretching out into Kensington Gardens. The Princess&#x27;s coffin spent its last night in London at the palace. On the morning of 6 September 1997, a tenor bell signalled the departure of the funeral cortège carrying the coffin from the palace on a gun carriage to Westminster Abbey for the ceremony. Her residence was stripped bare and lay vacant for 10 years after her death. It was split back into two apartments, with Apartment 8 being used by four of Charles&#x27;s charities and Apartment 9 becoming home to the Chief of the Defence Staff.

====21st century====

Following their marriage in 2011, the then-Duke and Duchess of Cambridge used Nottingham Cottage as their London residence. They then moved into the four-storey, 20-room Apartment 1A, the former residence of Princess Margaret, in 2013. Renovations took 18 months at a cost of £4.5 million, including new heating, electrics and plastering, and the removal of asbestos that required nearly everything to be stripped out internally, as well as a new roof.

Kensington Palace became the Duke and Duchess&#x27;s main residence in 2017, moving from their country home, Anmer Hall. The apartment covers four storeys, with three bedrooms, two nurseries and five reception rooms. In 2016, Diana&#x27;s former residence, Apartment 8, was turned into office space for the couple&#x27;s staff, official duties and charity work. The Duke and Duchess have hosted multiple engagements, receptions, and meetings at the palace.

On 28 March 2012, it was announced that Prince Harry had moved his residence from Clarence House to a one-bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace. From 2013, he resided at Nottingham Cottage. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex continued to live at the property until the birth of their son in spring 2019.

In April 2018, Princess Eugenie moved from St James&#x27;s Palace into Ivy Cottage at Kensington Palace. She lived there with her husband Jack Brooksbank until November 2020. In September 2019, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, previously residents of Apartment 1, moved to the Old Stables, a smaller home located within the palace&#x27;s estate. In summer 2022, The Prince and Princess of Wales moved their family residence to Adelaide Cottage near Windsor Castle. Kensington Palace remains their official London residence as well as the location of their household and offices.

==Interior and grounds==
Kensington Palace contains public and private apartments and residences within the building and its grounds. The palace houses a total of fifty residents. Apart from members of the royal family, it also hosts members of the military, courtiers, staff, and citizens who pay market rent.

===King and Queen&#x27;s State Apartments===

The King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s State Apartments are state rooms and private apartments historically used by various monarchs and consorts. The King&#x27;s State Apartments were used for diplomatic audiences and meetings, described as &quot;opulent&quot; and &quot;surprisingly sparse&quot;. The Queen&#x27;s State Apartments were a domestic residence typically used by consorts to live in and entertain. The state apartments were first opened to the public in 1899. The museum closed intermittently during the conflicts of the First and Second World Wars before reopening permanently in 1949.
The entryway to the King&#x27;s State Apartments is marked by the King&#x27;s Staircase, decorated with a painting by William Kent depicting George I&#x27;s royal court, completed in 1724. The apartment possesses several reception rooms. The Presence Chamber features a limewood fireplace where the monarch received ministers. The Privy Chamber was one of Queen Caroline&#x27;s favourite entertaining spaces. The Cupola Room has been described as the &quot;most splendidly decorated room in the palace&quot;, also by Kent.

The King&#x27;s Drawing Room, where courtiers would come &quot;in search of power and patronage&quot;, features a copy of &quot;Venus and Cupid&quot; by Giorgio Vasari, which Caroline attempted to have removed to no avail. The King&#x27;s Gallery, built for William III, is decorated with red accents and golden ornaments, used for exercise and displaying paintings. Featuring numerous works by Kent, it houses &quot;Charles I at the Hunt&quot; by Anthony van Dyck.

The Queen&#x27;s State Apartments consist of the rooms where Mary II and later royal consorts resided. The Queen&#x27;s Staircase is &quot;deliberately plainer&quot; than its counterpart, accessible to the gardens. The Queen&#x27;s Gallery, built in 1693, was previously filled with Turkish carpets and oriental artifacts, and was designed as a place for Mary to fulfil &quot;simple pastimes such as walking, reading, and needlework.&quot; The Queen&#x27;s Dining Room is where Mary and William would take their meals together in private, featuring 17th-century panelling. The Queen&#x27;s Drawing Room features décor from China and Japan, and features William and Mary&#x27;s intertwined monogram carved into the crown moulding. Mary&#x27;s bedroom, where she entertained friends, is included in the apartments.

===Apartment 1===
Apartment 1 is a royal residence located in the southwest wing of the palace. During its vacancy from 1939 and 1955, it was divided into two, with a separate Apartment 1 and Apartment 1A within the space. The apartment has 21 rooms and a walled garden, as well as adjoining doors to Apartment 1A. It has been described as a “lovely big apartment”; Apartment 1 is the second-biggest residence in the palace. Previous interior rooms have included the &quot;sizable&quot; library of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, and the sculpting studio of Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll.

===Apartment 1A ===
Apartment 1A is a royal residence, covering four storeys, with twenty rooms total. It has five reception rooms, each with fireplaces, as well as three bedrooms, dressing rooms and two nurseries. The upper level has nine staff bedrooms, while the basement holds a luggage room, gym, and laundry quarters. There are three kitchens, one for family use and two for the staff. The residence overlooks a large, walled-in garden, hidden from public view in the palace&#x27;s museum wing by frosted windows.

The entrance hall has intricate crown moulding and black-and-white tiling. The apartment features art and furnishings from the Royal Collection. The Duchess of Cambridge decorated the space with furniture from IKEA, with the interior featuring &quot;warm beiges and floral pillows&quot;, gold trim upholstery, and detailed carpeting.

===Apartments 8 &amp; 9===
Apartments 8 &amp; 9 are two conjoined chambers situated on the northern-most section of the main palatial building. The apartment covers three storeys. During its use as a residence, the two-room nursery covered the entirety of the top floor. Other spaces included two reception rooms: a drawing room doubling as Diana&#x27;s office, a sitting room with a television, and a formal dining room. In 1981, the apartments were combined to create a family home for Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales.

The residence had a helicopter pad, and many outdoor gardens, including one on the roof and a greenhouse where the family spent many hours. Diana decorated the residence in &quot;bold patterns and lush fabrics&quot;, as well as floral wallpaper and a mix of modern and antique furniture, upholstered with golden lacquer. From 1997, the apartments have been used as office space for various groups, charities, and staff.

===Apartment 10===
Apartment 10 is a residence situated in the north-east section of the palace, in the public gardens. The three-storey apartment holds five bedrooms and five reception rooms. Former tenant Princess Margaret described it as &quot;the doll&#x27;s house&quot;.

===Wren House===

Named for architect Christopher Wren, Wren House residence is near a cluster of cottages on the grounds of the palace, located north of the main building. It has five bedrooms and five reception rooms. The cottage covers two storeys, and has been noted as one of the more modest residences within the palace. Wren House is said to have the &quot;best view&quot; of the palace&#x27;s walled gardens.

===Nottingham Cottage===

Nottingham Cottage is a residence near a cluster of cottages on the grounds of the palace, located north of the main building. Described as a &quot;cosy property&quot;, it contains two bedrooms, two reception rooms, and a small garden.

===Ivy Cottage===

Ivy Cottage is a residence near a cluster of cottages on the grounds of the palace, located north of the main building. The cottage holds three bedrooms. While in residence, Princess Eugenie was reported to have renovated the residence and &quot;brightened the cottage up with lots of pops of colour&quot; and various art pieces.

===Old Stables===
The Old Stables is a residence near a cluster of cottages on the grounds of the palace, located north of the main building. During Sir Alan Lascelles&#x27; occupation, it was described as &quot;lavishly decorated&quot;. During the residence of Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester, the house was decorated with &quot;old wooden furniture&quot; and &quot;bright turquoise walls&quot;.

===King&#x27;s Kitchen Cottages and the Upper Lodge===
The King&#x27;s Kitchen Cottages and Upper Lodge make up staff residences.

===Chapel===
The Kensington Palace Chapel was built in the 1830s, used for private family services and occasions. Described as the &quot;heart&quot; of the palace, it was converted into residential space before being restored as a chapel by a conservation company in 2002. The space is approximately 9 meters long, including a &quot;variety of antique features&quot; and oak wall panelling. Renaissance era art pieces from the Royal Collection adorn the room, alongside a 19th-century brass hung chandelier. Family events that have taken place at the chapel include the 2004 wedding of Lady Davina Windsor, and the 2015 christening of Isabella Windsor, daughter of Lord Frederick Windsor and Lady Frederick Windsor.

==As a tourist attraction/other uses==
By the end of the 19th century, the State Rooms were severely neglected. The brickwork was decaying and the woodwork was infested with dry rot. Calls were made for the palace to be demolished, but Queen Victoria declared that &quot;while she lived, the palace in which she was born should not be destroyed&quot;. In 1897, Parliament was persuaded to pay for the restoration which was completed two years later. The State Rooms were opened to the public on the Queen&#x27;s birthday, 24 May 1899. This began the palace&#x27;s dual role as a private home to royalty and a public museum.

Queen Mary was instrumental in opening the State Apartments as a temporary location for the London Museum, now known as the Museum of London, from 1911 to 1914. The State Apartments were filled with showcases, some containing hundreds of objects including 18th-century costumes and dresses worn by Queen Victoria, Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary. The museum returned from 1950 to 1976 before it moved to its next home on London Wall.

In 1989 care for the Kensington Palace State Rooms was contracted out to Historic Royal Palaces Agency, a non-departmental public body, on behalf of the Department of the Environment. Historic Royal Palaces Agency became an independent charity in 1998 called Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which is dependent on charitable giving for management of the site. Under HRP the Kensington Palace State Rooms underwent a two-year, £12 million renovation, underwritten with contributions from the Heritage Lottery Fund as well as other public and private donations. New uniforms for staff were designed by Stuart Stockdale at Jaeger.

The re-opening of the palace occurred in time for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2012. Visitors now can choose four different routes throughout the palace that offer exhibits incorporating cutting-edge digital presentations, interactive experiences, and audio sequences that bring to life the gatherings of gowns, antique furniture, and other memorabilia of notable residents of the palace. These include William and Mary in the Queen&#x27;s State Apartments, the court of George I and II in the King&#x27;s State Apartments, and the life of Queen Victoria in the rooms most associated with her.

The fourth exhibit displays selections of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s wardrobe in the 1950s, Princess Margaret from the 1960 and 70s and Diana, Princess of Wales, in the 1980s during their fashion heyday. The grounds of the palace were renovated with enhancements including eliminating railings, fences, and shrubs that had undermined royal gardener Charles Bridgeman&#x27;s original landscaping. Two new public gardens to the south and east of the palace were installed that connect the property to Kensington Gardens.

The nearest tube stations are Queensway, Bayswater, High Street Kensington, or (slightly farther) Gloucester Road.

In October 2011, Disney, in cooperation with Historic Royal Palaces, hosted &quot;Rapunzel&#x27;s Royal Celebration&quot; at Kensington Palace, a special event in which Rapunzel (&quot;Tangled&quot;) was inducted as the tenth official Disney Princess and crowned. All nine existing Princesses attended – title characters Snow White, Cinderella, Pocahontas, and Mulan, as well as Aurora (&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;), Ariel (&quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;), Belle (&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;), Jasmine (&quot;Aladdin&quot;), and Tiana (&quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot;). Each of them arrived by carriage in a procession that passed through Hyde Park. Other Disney characters who attended were the Fairy Godmother and Flynn Rider, who crowned Rapunzel. An estimated 10,000 people watched the procession, and over 100 girls from 25 countries attended the ceremony inside the palace. It was the second Disney Princess induction/coronation to take place outside the Disney Parks and Resorts, and the first to take place outside the United States.

<text>A coalfield is an area of certain uniform characteristics where coal is mined. The criteria for determining the approximate boundary of a coalfield are geographical and cultural, in addition to geological. A coalfield often groups the seams of coal, railroad companies, cultural groups, and watersheds and other geographical considerations. At one time the coalfield designation was an important category in business and industrial discussions. The terminology declined into unimportance as the 20th century progressed, and was probably only referred to by a few small railroads and history buffs by the 1980s. Renewed interest in industrial heritage and coal mining history has brought the old names of the coalfields before a larger audience.

<text>The scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) is a medium-sized American songbird. Until recently, it was placed in the tanager family (Thraupidae), but it and other members of its genus are now classified as belonging to the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). The species&#x27; plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family, although the &quot;Piranga&quot; species lacks the thick conical bill (well suited to seed and insect eating) that many cardinals possess. The species resides in thick deciduous woodlands and suburbs.

==Etymology==

The genus name &quot;Piranga&quot; is from Tupi &quot;Tijepiranga&quot;, the name for an unknown small bird, and the specific &quot;olivacea&quot; is from Neo-Latin &quot;olivaceus&quot;, &quot;olive-green&quot;.

==Description==

The scarlet tanager, a mid-sized passerine, is marginally the smallest of the four species of &quot;Piranga&quot; that breed north of the Mexican border. It can weigh from , with an average of during breeding and an average of at the beginning of migration. Scarlet tanagers can range in length from and from in wingspan. Adults of both sexes have pale, horn-colored, fairly stout, and smooth-textured bills. Adult males are crimson-red with black wings and tail. The male&#x27;s coloration is intense and deeply red, similar but deeper in shade than the males of two occasionally co-existing relatives, the northern cardinal and the summer tanager, both which lack black wings. Females are yellowish on the underparts and olive on top, with yellow-olive-toned wings and tail. The adult male&#x27;s winter plumage is similar to the female&#x27;s, but the wings and tail remain darker. Young males briefly show a more complex, variegated plumage intermediate between adult males and females.

The somewhat confusing specific epithet &quot;olivacea&quot; (&quot;the olive-colored one&quot;) was based on a female or immature specimen rather than &quot;erythromelas&quot; (&quot;the red-and-black one&quot;), which authors attempted to ascribe to the species throughout the 19th century (older scientific names always takes precedence, however).

Female, immature, and nonbreeding males may be distinguished from the same ages and sexes in summer tanagers, which are more brownish overall, and western tanagers, which always have bold white bars and more yellowish undersides than scarlet tanagers. The song of the scarlet tanager sounds somewhat like a hoarser version of the American robin&#x27;s and is only slightly dissimilar from the songs of the summer and western tanagers. The call of the scarlet tanager is an immediately distinctive &quot;chip-burr&quot; or &quot;chip-churr&quot;, which is very different from the &quot;pit-i-tuck&quot; of the summer tanager and the softer, rolled &quot;pri-tic&quot; or &quot;prit-i-tic&quot; of western tanager.

==Behavior==
Their breeding habitat is large stretches of deciduous forest, especially with oaks, across eastern North America. They can occur, with varying degrees of success, in young successional woodlands and occasionally in extensive plantings of shade trees in suburban areas, parks, and cemeteries. For a viable breeding population, at least 10 to 12 hectares of forest are required. In winter, Scarlet tanagers migrate to the montane forest of the Andean foothills of northwestern South America, passing through Central America around April, and again around October. They begin arriving in their breeding grounds in numbers by about May and already start to move south again in midsummer; by early October, they are all on their way south. The bird is an extremely rare vagrant to Western Europe.

Scarlet tanagers are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight and then returning to the same general perch, in a hunting style known as &quot;sallying&quot;. Sometimes, however, they also capture their prey on the forest floor. They eat mainly insects, but opportunistically consume fruit when plentiful. Any flying variety of insect can readily be taken when common, such as bees, wasps, hornets, ants, and sawflies; moths and butterflies; beetles; flies; cicadas, leafhoppers, spittlebugs, treehoppers, plant lice, and scale insects; termites; grasshoppers and locusts; dragonflies; and dobsonflies. Scarlet tanagers also take snails, earthworms, and spiders. While summer tanagers are famous for this feeding method, when capturing bees, wasps, and hornets, scarlet tanagers also rake the prey against a branch to remove their stingers before consumption. Plant components of their diet include a wide variety of fruits that are eaten mainly when insect population are low: blackberries (&quot;Rubus allegheniensis&quot;), raspberries (&quot;R. ideaus&quot;), huckleberries (&quot;Gaylussacia&quot; sp.), juneberries and serviceberries (&quot;Amelanchier&quot; spp.), mulberries (&quot;Morus rubra&quot;), strawberries (&quot;Fragaria virginiana&quot;), and chokeberries (&quot;Aronia melanocarpa&quot;).

===Breeding===
Male scarlet tanagers reach their breeding ground from mid-May to early June. Females generally arrive several days to a week later. Nest building and egg laying both occur usually in less than two weeks after the adults arrive. The clutch is usually four eggs, occasionally from three to five and exceptionally from one to six eggs may be laid. The eggs are a light blue color, often with a slight greenish or whitish tinge. Incubation lasts for 11 to 14 days. Hatching and fledging are both reached at different points in summer depending on how far north the tanagers are breeding, from June-early July in the southern parts of its breeding range to as late as August or even early September in the northernmost part of its range. The average weight at hatching is , with the nestlings increasing their weight to by 10 days, or 70% of the parent&#x27;s weight. The young leave the nest by 9–12 days of age and fly capably by the time they are a few weeks old. If the nesting attempt is disturbed, scarlet tanagers apparently are unable to attempt a second brood, as several other passerines can. In a study of 16 nests in Michigan, 50% were successful in producing one or more fledglings. In western New York, fledgling success increased from 22% in scattered patches of woods to as high as 64% in extensive, undisturbed hardwood forest.

==Threats and status==

Exposure and starvation can occasionally kill scarlet tanagers, especially when exceptionally cold or wet weather hits eastern North America. They often die from collisions with man-made objects including TV and radio towers, buildings and cars. Beyond failure due to brood parasitism of brown-headed cowbirds (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;), predation is the primary direct cause of nesting failures. In one study, 69–78% of nests were preyed upon. Recorded nest predators are primarily avian like blue jays (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), common grackles (&quot;Quiscalus quiscula&quot;) and American crows (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;), although others such as squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), domestic cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), and snakes take a heavy toll. Raptorial birds hunt and kill many scarlet tanagers from fledgling throughout their adult lives, including all three North American &quot;Accipiter&quot; species, merlins (&quot;Falco columbarius&quot;), and owls, including eastern screech owls (&quot;Megascops asio&quot;), barred owls (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), long-eared owls (&quot;Asio otus&quot;), and short-eared owls (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;).

Scarlet tanagers birds do best in the forest interior, where they are less exposed to predators and brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird. Being a bird that evolved to breed in forest interior and not exposed to the brown cowbird prior to habitat fragmentation, scarlet tanagers have not evolved any defensive strategies to cope with it. Where forest fragmentation occurs, which is quite widespread, the scarlet tanager suffers high rates of predation and brood parasitism in small forest plots and is often absent completely from plots less than a minimum size. Their nests are typically built on horizontal tree branches. Specifically, their numbers are declining in some areas due to habitat fragmentation, but the IUCN still classifies the scarlet tanager as being of least concern.

<doc id="391865" wikidata="Q447077" url="?curid=391865" title="Mamoru Shigemitsu">
<text>was a Japanese diplomat who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs three times during and after World War II and as Deputy Prime Minister. As a civilian plenipotentiary representing the Japanese government, Shigemitsu cosigned the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on board the battleship on September 2, 1945.

==Early life and career==
Shigemitsu was born in what is now part of the city of Bungo-ōno, Ōita Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from the Law School of Tokyo Imperial University in 1911 and immediately entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After World War I, he served in numerous overseas diplomatic assignments, including in Germany and the United Kingdom and briefly as consul at the Japanese consulate in Seattle, Washington, United States.

==Pre-war==
Following the Mukden Incident in 1931, Shigemitsu was active in various European capitals, attempting to reduce alarm at Japanese military activities in Manchuria.

During the First Shanghai Incident of 1932, he was successful in enlisting the aid of western nations in brokering a ceasefire between the Kuomintang Army and the Imperial Japanese Army. On April 29, 1932, while attending a celebration for the birthday of Emperor Hirohito in Shanghai, a Korean independence activist, Yoon Bong-Gil, threw a bomb at a reviewing stand killing General Yoshinori Shirakawa and wounding several others, including Shigemitsu. Shigemitsu lost his right leg in the attack and walked with an artificial leg and cane for the rest of his life.

Shigemitsu later became ambassador to the Soviet Union, and in 1938, he negotiated a settlement of the Russo-Japanese border clash at Changkufeng Hill. He then became Japan&#x27;s ambassador to the United Kingdom during a period of deteriorating Anglo-Japanese relations, most notably the Tientsin incident of 1939, which pushed Japan to the brink of war with the United Kingdom. He was recalled in June 1941.

==World War II==
Shigemitsu was highly critical of the foreign policies of Yōsuke Matsuoka, especially the Tripartite Pact, which he warned would further strengthen anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States. Shigemitsu spent two weeks in Washington, DC, on the way back from Britain and conferred with Ambassador Kichisaburō Nomura to attempt to arrange for direct face-to-face negotiations between Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Shigemitsu&#x27;s many attempts to stave off World War II angered the militarists in Tokyo, and only two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was sidelined with an appointment as ambassador to the Japanese-sponsored Reorganized National Government of China. In China, Shigemitsu argued that the success of the proposed Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere depended on the equal treatment of China and the other Asian nations by Japan.

On April 20, 1943, in a move that was viewed as a sign that Japan might be preparing for a collapse of the Axis Powers, Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō replaced Foreign Minister Masayuki Tani with Shigemitsu, who had been steadfast in his opposition to the militarists. Shigemitsu was thus foreign minister during the Greater East Asia Conference. The American press often referred to him in headlines as &quot;Shiggy&quot;.

From July 22, 1944, to April 7, 1945, he served simultaneously as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Greater East Asia in the Kuniaki Koiso administration. He then again served as Minister of Foreign Affairs briefly in August 1945 in the Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko administration right before Japan&#x27;s surrender.

Shigemitsu, as civilian plenipotentiary, along with General Yoshijirō Umezu, signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on board the battleship on September 2, 1945.

==Post-war==
Despite Shigemitsu&#x27;s well-known opposition to the war, at the insistence of the Soviet Union, he was taken into custody by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers and held in Sugamo Prison as an accused war criminal. Despite a signed deposition by Joseph Grew, the former ambassador of the United States to Japan, over the protests of Joseph B. Keenan, the chief prosecutor, Shigemitsu and his case came to trial and was convicted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East for waging an aggressive war and for not doing enough to protect prisoners-of-war from inhumane treatment. However, the tribunal was extremely lenient on the grounds that Shigemitsu had regularly opposed Japanese militarism and protested the POWs&#x27; inhumane treatment.

He was sentenced to seven years in prison, the lightest punishment that was handed down to anyone convicted at the trial. He was paroled in 1950.

After the end of the occupation of Japan, Shigemitsu formed a short-lived political party, Kaishintō, which merged with the Japan Democratic Party in 1954. In October 1952, he was elected to a seat in the Lower House of the Diet of Japan, and in 1954, he became Deputy Prime Minister of Japan under Prime Minister Ichirō Hatoyama, the leader of Japan Democratic Party.

The cabinet continued after the merger of the party and the Liberal Party as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in 1955, and Shigemitsu continued to hold the post of Deputy Prime Minister of Japan until 1956.

Shigemitsu concurrently served as Foreign Minister from 1954 to 1956. In April 1955, he represented Japan at the Bandung Conference held in Indonesia, which marked the beginning of the return of Japan to participating in an international conference since the League of Nations. Then in August, Shigemitsu led a high-level Japanese delegation to the United States to press for a revision to the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty, but this effort was met with a cold reception from Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who had been the treaty&#x27;s primary architect and was loath to revisit it. Dulles told Shigemitsu in no uncertain terms that any discussion of treaty revision was &quot;premature&quot; because Japan lacked &quot;the unity, cohesion, and capacity to operate under a new treaty arrangement,&quot; and Shigemitsu was forced to return to Japan empty-handed.

The following year, Shigemitsu addressed the United Nations General Assembly, pledging Japan&#x27;s support of the founding principles of the United Nations and formally applying for membership. Japan became the UN&#x27;s 80th member on December 18, 1956. Shigemitsu also travelled to Moscow in 1956 in an attempt to normalize diplomatic relations and to resolve the Kuril Islands dispute. The visit resulted in the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956.

==Death==
In January 1957, a year after his visit to the Soviet Union, Shigemitsu died of myocardial infarction at 69 in his summer home in Yugawara, Kanagawa.

<doc id="391866" wikidata="Q1078246" url="?curid=391866" title="Summer tanager">
<text>The summer tanager (Piranga rubra) is a medium-sized American songbird. Formerly placed in the tanager family (Thraupidae), it and other members of its genus are now classified in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). The species&#x27;s plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family.

==Taxonomy==

The summer tanager was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Fringilla rubra&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;summer red-bird&quot; described and illustrated by Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; which was published in 1729–1732. Catesby gave the location as Carolina, Linnaeus specified America; the type location is now South Carolina. The summer tanager is the type species of the genus &quot;Piranga&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1808. The genus name &quot;Piranga&quot; is from Tupi &quot;Tijepiranga&quot;, the name for an unknown small bird; the specific &quot;rubra&quot; is from Latin &quot;ruber&quot; meaning &quot;red&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognised:
==Description==
Adults have stout, pointed bills and measure in length and weigh a mean , ranging from 25.8–33.6 g (0.99–1.19 oz). Wingspan ranges from 28 to 30 cm. Adult males are rose red and similar in appearance to the hepatic tanager, although the latter has a dark bill; females are orangish on the underparts and olive on top, with olive-brown wings and tail. As with all other birds, all red and orange colorations are acquired through their diet.

The summer tanager has an American robin-like song, similar enough that novices sometimes mistake this bird for that species. The song consists of melodic units, repeated in a constant stream. The summer tanager&#x27;s song, however, is much more monotonous than that of &quot;T. migratorius&quot;, often consisting of as few as three or four distinct units. It is clearer and less nasal than the song of the scarlet tanager. The summer tanager also has a sharp, agitated-sounded call &quot;pi-tuk&quot; or &quot;pik-i-tuk-i-tuk&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The summer tanager&#x27;s habitat varies regionally, with pine-oak and mixed forests preferred in the southeastern United States, and riparian lowlands preferred in the southwest. These birds spend the breeding season across the southern United States and Northern Mexico, reaching as far north as Iowa and New Jersey in the east. They overwinter in Mexico, Central America and northern South America. This tanager is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe.

==Behaviour and ecology==

These birds are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects, but also regularly supplement their diets with fruit. Fruit of &quot;Cymbopetalum mayanum&quot; (Annonaceae) are an especially well-liked food in their winter quarters and birds will forage in human-altered habitat. Consequently, these trees can be planted to entice them to residential areas, and they may well be attracted to bird feeders. Summer tanagers have also been reported to eat larger invertebrate prey, including snails and slugs; there is additionally one report of an individual attempting to eat a vertebrate–a green anole–at a migratory stopover site in Mississippi.

Summer tanagers build a cup nest on a horizontal tree branch anywhere from 4–45 feet from the ground.

<doc id="391868" wikidata="Q6679988" url="?curid=391868" title="Frogmore">
<text>Frogmore is an estate within the Home Park, adjoining Windsor Castle, in Berkshire, England. It comprises , of primarily private gardens managed by the Crown Estate. It is the location of Frogmore House, a royal retreat, and Frogmore Cottage. The name derives from the preponderance of frogs which have always lived in this low-lying and marshy area near the River Thames. This area is part of the local flood plain. Its large landscaped gardens are Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Part of the gardens of the estate are set aside as burial places for members of the British royal family: the Royal Mausoleum (containing the tomb of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert); the Royal Burial Ground; and the Duchess of Kent&#x27;s Mausoleum (the burial place of Queen Victoria&#x27;s mother).

==Frogmore House and grounds==

Frogmore House was built in the 1680s and in 1792 the house and estate were bought by George III for his wife Queen Charlotte, although the land had formed part of the Windsor royal hunting ground since the reign of Henry VIII. Charlotte engaged James Wyatt to redesign the house and sought the advice of her Vice-Chamberlain, William Price, regarding the redevelopment of the grounds. Price’s brother Uvedale, an early exponent of the Picturesque, clearly influenced the design. In 1840, Frogmore was inherited by the Duchess of Kent and, following her death in 1861, by her daughter, Queen Victoria. The estate became a favoured, almost sacred, retreat; after burying her mother in a mausoleum overlooking the lake, the Queen commissioned another, the Royal Mausoleum, for her husband Albert, Prince Consort and for herself, after Albert’s death in 1861.

During her long widowhood, when she rarely visited London, Victoria spent much of her time at Windsor and at Frogmore. She undertook further building work in the gardens, employing Samuel Sanders Teulon to construct a teahouse, and engaging Thomas Willement to redecorate the Gothic Ruin, originally designed by Wyatt and Princess Elizabeth. In this setting Victoria placed the Indian Kiosk, and in her later years would often undertake correspondence in a tent set up nearby, attended by her Indian servant Abdul Karim.

In 1900 Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma was born at Frogmore House. On the estate near the House is Frogmore Cottage, built for Queen Charlotte around 1801. Frogmore Gardens are Grade I listed.

==Places of burial==
===Duchess of Kent&#x27;s Mausoleum===

The first of two mausoleums within the Frogmore Gardens is the burial place of Queen Victoria&#x27;s mother, Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, the Duchess of Kent. The Mausoleum was designed by the architect A J Humbert, to a concept design by Prince Albert&#x27;s favourite artist, Professor Ludwig Gruner.

In the latter years of her life, the Duchess lived in Frogmore House and in the 1850s, construction began on a beautiful domed &#x27;temple&#x27; in the grounds of the estate. The top portion of the finished building was intended to serve as a summer-house for the Duchess during her lifetime, while the lower level was destined as her final resting place. The Duchess died at Frogmore House on 16 March 1861 before the summer-house was completed so the upper chamber became part of the mausoleum and now contains a statue of the Duchess by William Theed (1864).

===Royal Mausoleum===
The second mausoleum in the grounds of Frogmore, just a short distance from the Duchess of Kent&#x27;s Mausoleum, is the much larger Royal Mausoleum, the burial place of Queen Victoria and her consort, Prince Albert. Queen Victoria and her husband had long intended to construct a special resting place for them both, instead of the two of them being buried in one of the traditional resting places of British Royalty, such as Westminster Abbey or St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. The mausoleum for the Queen&#x27;s mother was being constructed at Frogmore in 1861 when Prince Albert died in December of the same year. Within a few days of his death, proposals for the mausoleum were being drawn up by the same designers involved in the Duchess of Kent&#x27;s Mausoleum: Professor Gruner and A. J. Humbert.

Work commenced in March 1862. The dome was made by October and the building was consecrated in December 1862, although the decoration was not finished until August 1871. The building is in the form of a Greek cross. The exterior was inspired by Italian Romanesque buildings, the walls are of granite and Portland stone and the roof is covered with Australian copper. The internal decoration is in the style of Albert&#x27;s favourite painter, Raphael, an example of Victoriana at its most opulent. The interior walls are mainly faced in Portuguese red marble, a gift from King Luis I of Portugal, a cousin of both Victoria and Albert, and are inlaid with other marbles from around the world. The monumental tomb itself was designed by Baron Carlo Marochetti. It features recumbent marble effigies of the Queen and Prince Albert. The sarcophagus was made from a single piece of flawless grey Aberdeen granite. The Queen&#x27;s effigy was made at the same time, but was not put in the mausoleum until after her funeral.

Only Victoria and Albert are interred there, but the mausoleum contains other memorials. Among those is a monument to Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse-Darmstadt (1843–1878), Victoria&#x27;s second daughter, who died of diphtheria shortly after her youngest daughter May (1874–1878). In the centre of the chapel is a monument to Edward, Duke of Kent, Victoria&#x27;s father. He died in 1820 and is buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

One of the sculptures is of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in Saxon Dress, commissioned after Prince Albert&#x27;s death and executed by William Theed (1804–91). It was unveiled on 20 May 1867 in Windsor Castle, and was moved to the Royal Mausoleum in 1938. The plaster model, which was exhibited in 1868 at the Royal Academy of Arts, is on loan from the Royal Collection to the National Portrait Gallery, London. Queen Victoria recorded in her diary that the idea for it came from Victoria, Princess Royal (her eldest child) and that the inscription on the plinth is a quotation from &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith. The inscription on the plinth alludes to the poet&#x27;s lament for the passing of the imagined village of &#x27;Sweet Auburn&#x27;.

The building has been closed to the public since 2007 because it is structurally unsound. The foundations are waterlogged, and the lower elements of the building are disintegrating. In February 2018, the Royal Household announced it was undertaking repair work on the mausoleum; the work is expected to be complete by 2023.

===Royal Burial Ground===

Since its inauguration in 1928, most members of the royal family, except for Kings and Queens, have been interred in the Royal Burial Ground, a cemetery behind Queen Victoria&#x27;s mausoleum. Among those buried there are Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, and Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, as well as Prince George, Duke of Kent; the Duke of Windsor, who reigned as King Edward VIII before abdication; and his wife Wallis. Many members of the families of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein and of the Marquess of Cambridge are also buried there. Also in the Burial Ground is the cenotaph of Queen Maria of Yugoslavia, a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria and wife of King Aleksandar I of Yugoslavia. Having lived in exile in London, she was buried here from 1961 until April 2013, when her remains were exhumed and returned to Oplenac, Serbia.

==The Gothic Ruin, Queen Victoria&#x27;s Teahouse and the Indian Kiosk==
Various other structures stand in the grounds including the Gothic Ruin (1793), Queen Victoria&#x27;s Teahouse (a brick pavilion of 1869) and the Indian Kiosk. Constructed of marble, the kiosk was taken from the Qaisar Bagh in Lucknow following the looting of the city, by the Viceroy of India, Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning in 1858. The kiosk is octagonal with an onion dome with round arches and deep eaves. It is a Grade II listed structure. Teulon’s Teahouse also has a Grade II listing while James Wyatt’s nearby Gothic Ruin (a folly) is designated Grade II*.

==Public access==
The house and gardens are usually open to the public on about six days each year, usually around Easter and the August Bank Holiday. The Royal Burial Ground may be viewed from around its perimeter on the days that the gardens are open to the public. The Duchess of Kent&#x27;s mausoleum may also be viewed externally, but is never open to the public.

<text>81 (eighty-one) is the natural number following 80 and preceding 82.

==In mathematics==
81 is:

* the square of 9 and the second fourth-power of a prime; 34.
* with an aliquot sum of 40; within an aliquot sequence of three composite numbers (81,40,50,43,1,0) to the Prime in the 43-aliquot tree.
* a perfect totient number like all powers of three.
* a heptagonal number.
* an icosioctagonal number.
* a centered octagonal number.
* a tribonacci number.
* an open meandric number.
* the ninth member of the Mian-Chowla sequence.
* a palindromic number in bases 8 (1218) and 26 (3326).
* a Harshad number in bases 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10 and 13.
* one of three non-trivial numbers (the other two are 1458 and 1729) which, when its digits (in decimal) are added together, produces a sum which, when multiplied by its reversed self, yields the original number:
: 8 + 1 = 9
: 9 × 9 = 81 (although this case is somewhat degenerate, as the sum has only a single digit).

The inverse of 81 is 0. recurring, missing only the digit &quot;8&quot; from the complete set of digits. This is an example of the general rule that, in base &quot;b&quot;,
:formula_1
omitting only the digit &quot;b&quot;−2.

==In other fields==
Eighty-one is also:
*The number of chapters in the Tao Te Ching, the foundational text of Taoism.
*The symbolic number of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club. &#x27;H&#x27; and &#x27;A&#x27; are the 8th and 1st letter of the alphabet, respectively.
*81 (八一) is referenced in flags and symbols of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army as it was founded on August 1 (8/1).
*The career high of points scored in a single game by Kobe Bryant on January 22, 2006 against the Toronto Raptors.

<text>84 (eighty-four) is the natural number following 83 and preceding 85. It is seven dozens.

== In mathematics ==

84 is a semiperfect number, being thrice a perfect number, and the sum of the sixth pair of twin primes formula_1. It is the number of four-digit perfect powers in decimal.

It is the third (or second) dodecahedral number, and the sum of the first seven triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28), which makes it the seventh tetrahedral number.

The number of divisors of 84 is 12. As no smaller number has more than 12 divisors, 84 is a largely composite number.

The twenty-second unique prime in decimal, with notably different digits than its preceding (and known following) terms in the same sequence, contains a total of 84 digits. 

A hepteract is a seven-dimensional hypercube with 84 penteract 5-faces.

84 is the limit superior of the largest finite subgroup of the mapping class group of a genus formula_2 surface divided by formula_2.

Under Hurwitz&#x27;s automorphisms theorem, a smooth connected Riemann surface formula_4 of genus formula_5 will contain an automorphism group formula_6 whose order is classically bound to formula_7. 

84 is the thirtieth and largest formula_8 for which the cyclotomic field formula_9 has class number formula_10 (or unique factorization), preceding 60 (that is the composite index of 84), and 48.

There are 84 zero divisors in the 16-dimensional sedenions formula_11.

== In other fields ==
Eighty-four is also:
* The number of years in the , a cycle used in the past by Celtic peoples, equal to 3 cycles of the Julian Calendar and to 4 Metonic cycles and 1 octaeteris

<text>86 (eighty-six) is the natural number following 85 and preceding 87.

==In mathematics==
86 is:

* nontotient and a noncototient.
* the 25th distinct semiprime and the 13th of the form (2.q).
* together with 85 and 87, forms the middle semiprime in the 2nd cluster of three consecutive semiprimes; the first comprising 33, 34, 35.
* an Erdős–Woods number, since it is possible to find sequences of 86 consecutive integers such that each inner member shares a factor with either the first or the last member.
* a happy number and a self number in base 10.
* with an aliquot sum of 46; itself a semiprime, within an aliquot sequence of seven members (86,46,26,16,15,9,4,3,1,0) in the Prime 3-aliquot tree.

It appears in the Padovan sequence, preceded by the terms 37, 49, 65 (it is the sum of the first two of these).

It is conjectured that 86 is the largest n for which the decimal expansion of 2n contains no 0.

86 = (8 × 6 = 48) + (4 × 8 = 32) + (3 × 2 = 6). That is, 86 is equal to the sum of the numbers formed in calculating its multiplicative persistence.

==In other fields==
*In American English, and particularly in the food service industry, 86 has become a slang term referring to an item being out of stock or discontinued, and by extension to a person no longer welcome on the premises.
*86, particularly &quot;Hachi-Roku (ハチロク),&quot; is often used in Japan as the nickname for the Toyota AE86.

<text>87 (eighty-seven) is the natural number following 86 and preceding 88.

==In mathematics==
87 is:

* the sum of the squares of the first four primes (87 = 22 + 32 + 52 + 72).
* the sum of the sums of the divisors of the first 10 positive integers.
* the thirtieth semiprime, and the twenty-sixth distinct semiprime and the eighth of the form (3.q).
* together with 85 and 86, forms the last semiprime in the 2nd cluster of three consecutive semiprimes; the first comprising 33, 34, 35.
* with an aliquot sum of 33; itself a semiprime, within an aliquot sequence of five composite numbers (87,33,15,9,4,3,1,0) to the Prime in the 3-aliquot tree.
* 5! - 4! - 3! - 2! - 1! = 87
* the last two decimal digits of Graham&#x27;s number.

==In sports==
* Cricket in Australia holds 87 as a superstitiously unlucky score and is referred to as &quot;the devil&#x27;s number&quot;. This originates from the fact that 87 is 13 runs short of a century. 187, 287, and so on are also considered unlucky but are not as common as 87 on its own.

==In other fields==
Eighty-seven is also:
*The opus number of the 24 Preludes and Fugues of Dmitri Shostakovich.
*In model railroading, the ratio of the popular H0 scale is 1:87. scale claims to offer precise proportions of wheels and tracks of real railroads.
*87 is by far the most commonly used octane rating of gasoline in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

<text>89 (eighty-nine) is the natural number following 88 and preceding 90.

== In mathematics ==
89 is:

* the 24th prime number, following 83 and preceding 97.
* a Chen prime.
* a Pythagorean prime.
* the smallest Sophie Germain prime to start a Cunningham chain of the first kind of six terms, {89, 179, 359, 719, 1439, 2879}.
* an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form .
* The 11th Fibonacci number and thus a Fibonacci prime as well. The first few digits of its reciprocal coincide with the Fibonacci sequence due to the identity 
::formula_1
* a Markov number, appearing in solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation with other odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers.

&quot;M&quot;89 is the 10th Mersenne prime.

Although 89 is not a Lychrel number in base 10, it is unusual that it takes 24 iterations of the reverse and add process to reach a palindrome. Among the known non-Lychrel numbers in the first 10000 integers, no other number requires that many or more iterations. The palindrome reached is also unusually large: 8813200023188.

There are exactly 1000 prime numbers between 1 and 892=7921.

== In sports ==
* The Oklahoma Redhawks, an American minor league baseball team, were formerly known as the Oklahoma 89ers (1962–1997). The number alludes to the Land Run of 1889, when the Unassigned Lands of Oklahoma were opened to white settlement. The team&#x27;s home of Oklahoma City was founded during this event.
* In Rugby, an &quot;89&quot; or eight-nine move is a phase following a scrum, in which the number 8 catches the ball and transfers it to number 9 (scrum half).

== In other fields ==

Eighty-nine is also:
* &quot;Information Is Beautiful&quot; cites eighty-nine as one of the words censored on the Chinese internet.

<text>The American Academy of Arts and Sciences (The Academy) is one of the oldest learned societies in the United States. It was founded in 1780 during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, Andrew Oliver, and other Founding Fathers of the United States. It is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Membership in the academy is achieved through a petition, review, and election process. The academy&#x27;s quarterly journal, &quot;Dædalus&quot;, is published by the MIT Press on behalf of the academy, and has been open-access since January 2021. The academy also conducts multidisciplinary public policy research.

Laurie L. Patton has served as President of the Academy since January 2025.

==History==
The Academy was established by the Massachusetts legislature on May 4, 1780, charted in order &quot;to cultivate every art and science which may tend to advance the interest, honor, dignity, and happiness of a free, independent, and virtuous people.&quot; The sixty-two incorporating fellows represented varying interests and high standing in the political, professional, and commercial sectors of the state. The first class of new members, chosen by the Academy in 1781, included Benjamin Franklin and George Washington as well as several international honorary members. The initial volume of Academy &quot;Memoirs&quot; appeared in 1785, and the &quot;Proceedings&quot; followed in 1846. In the 1950s, the Academy launched its journal &quot;Daedalus&quot;, reflecting its commitment to a broader intellectual and socially-oriented program.

Since the second half of the twentieth century, independent research has become a central focus of the Academy. In the late 1950s, arms control emerged as one of its signature concerns. The Academy also served as the catalyst in establishing the National Humanities Center in North Carolina. In the late 1990s, the Academy developed a new strategic plan, focusing on four major areas: science, technology, and global security; social policy and education; humanities and culture; and education. In 2002, the Academy established a visiting scholars program in association with Harvard University. More than 75 academic institutions from across the country have become Affiliates of the Academy to support this program and other Academy initiatives.

The Academy has sponsored a number of awards and prizes, throughout its history and has offered opportunities for fellowships and visiting scholars at the Academy. 

In July 2013, the Boston Globe exposed then president Leslie Berlowitz for falsifying her credentials, faking a doctorate, and consistently mistreating her staff. Berlowitz subsequently resigned.

==Projects==
===The Humanities Indicators===

A project of the Academy that equips researchers, policymakers, universities, foundations, museums, libraries, humanities councils, and other public institutions with statistical tools for answering basic questions about primary and secondary humanities education, undergraduate and graduate education in the humanities, the humanities workforce, levels and sources of program funding, public understanding and impact of the humanities, and other areas of concern in the humanities community. It is modeled on the Science and Engineering Indicators, published biennially by the National Science Board as required by Congress.

Astronomer Maria Mitchell was the first woman elected to the Academy, in 1848.

The current membership encompasses over 5,700 members based across the United States and around the world. Academy members include more than 250 Nobel laureates and more than 60 Pulitzer Prize winners.

Of the Academy&#x27;s 14,343 members since 1780, 1,406 are or have been affiliated with Harvard University, 611 with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 433 with Yale University, 425 with the University of California, Berkeley, and 404 with Stanford University.

<text>Donington Park is a motorsport circuit located near Castle Donington in Leicestershire, England. The circuit business is now owned by Jonathan Palmer&#x27;s MotorSport Vision organisation, and the surrounding Donington Park Estate, still owned by the Wheatcroft family, is currently under lease by MotorSport Vision until 2038. It has a capacity of 120,000, and is also the venue of the Download Festival.

Originally part of the Donington Hall estate, it was created as a racing circuit during the period between the First and Second World Wars when the German Silver Arrows were battling for the European Championship. Used as a military vehicle storage depot during the Second World War, it fell into disrepair until bought by local construction entrepreneur Tom Wheatcroft. Revived under his ownership in the 1970s, it hosted a single Formula One race in 1993, but became the favoured home of the British round of the MotoGP motorcycling championship.

Leased by Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd in 2007 the hope that Formula One racing could return to the track, the incomplete venture failed to raise sufficient financial backing during the aftermath of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. DVLL consequently lost the rights to the British rounds of both Formula 1 and MotoGP series, and in its bankruptcy returned the track to the Wheatcroft family in December 2009.

Under Wheatcroft&#x27;s ownership, the venue underwent significant work, with the track restored to use in autumn 2010, before major upgrades in the following five years. At the end of 2010, it was announced that Donington would become home to an annual historic motorsport event, the Donington Historic Festival, with new events constantly being added. Since 2010, significant investment across the venue has seen major improvements made to its infrastructure, while the circuit has become a regular fixture for top class motorcycling in the form of the Superbike World Championship.

In January 2017, the circuit business and a long-term lease on the estate was purchased by MotorSport Vision, with the purchase cleared by authorities in August of the same year. Significant investment has seen facilities at the venue brought up to modern standards, with a new restaurant, toilet blocks, large new grandstand and new circuit offices, as well as other detail changes. As well as improving the infrastructure, MSV made additions to the race calendar, with additional major events planned for 2019 which included extra rounds of the British Superbike Championship and British GT.

==History==

===Creation and pre-war racing===
Donington Park motor racing circuit was the first permanent park circuit in England, which also ended the race circuit monopoly that Brooklands had held since 1907.

Fred Craner was a former motorcycle rider who had taken part in seven Isle of Man TT races, and was by 1931 a Derby garage owner and secretary of the Derby &amp; District Motor Club.
Craner approached John Gillies Shields, the owner of the Donington Hall estate, to use the extensive roads on his land for racing.

The original track was in length, and based on normal width unsealed estate roads. The first motor cycle race took place on Whit Monday (25 May) 1931. For 1933 Craner obtained permission to build a permanent track, with the original layout widened and sealed at a cost of £12,000. The first car race was held on 25 March, followed by three car meetings further that year. The first Donington Park Trophy race was held on 7 October 1933, and the 20-lap invitation event was won by the Earl Howe in a Bugatti Type 51.

In 1935 the first Donington Grand Prix was won by Richard &quot;Mad Jack&quot; Shuttleworth in an Alfa Romeo P3.
In the 1937 Donington Grand Prix and 1938 Donington Grand Prix, the race winners were respectively Bernd Rosemeyer and Tazio Nuvolari, both in Auto Union &#x27;Silver Arrows.&#x27;

The circuit at Donington Park was closed in 1940 due to World War II, when it was requisitioned by the Ministry of Defence and was converted into a military vehicle depot. It was &quot;derequisitioned&quot; in 1956 and approved for racing by local planning authorities in 1957.

===Wheatcroft revival (1971–2006)===
In 1971 the park was bought by business man and car collector Tom Wheatcroft, who funded the rebuilding of the track. Wheatcroft moved his collection to a museum known as the Donington Grand Prix Exhibition which opened in 1973, and had the largest collection of Grand Prix cars in the world until its closure in 2018.

Wheatcroft had to battle against Leicestershire County Council, which had refused to allow planning consent for a return to racing, but Wheatcroft successfully appealed and had laid out the track by early 1976.

The first postwar race meeting was for motorcycles held on Sunday, 15 May 1977, organised by The Pathfinders and Derby Motor Club. The motor racing circuit re-opened for cars on Saturday 28 May 1977. The first postwar car race meeting was organised by the Nottingham Sports Car Club, sponsored by local Lotus dealers, J A Else of Codnor. That first car meeting nearly did not happen, as the local ramblers tried to assert their rights to retain access to footpaths at the eleventh hour. The meeting went ahead as a &quot;Motor Trial&quot;, a legal loophole that curtailed the use of single seater racing cars for that opening meeting. The NSCC continued to run race meetings at Donington until the Donington Racing Club was formed and a licence to run race meetings obtained.

The Melbourne Loop was built in 1985 to increase the lap distance to and allow the track to host Grand Prix motorcycle races. At the previously the circuit was deemed too short. The shorter layout remains as the &quot;National&quot; circuit, which is used for most non-Grand Prix events.

Near the end of the 20th century Donington has held meetings of MotoGP, the British Touring Car Championship and British Superbike Championship, as well as the 1993 European Grand Prix.

Other events taking place at the track include a 1000 km endurance race for the Le Mans Series in 2006, the World Series by Renault and the Great and British Motorsport Festival. On 26 August 2007, the circuit hosted the British Motocross Grand Prix, with a purpose-built motocross circuit constructed on the infield of the road circuit.

===Donington Ventures Leisure (2007–2009)===
In 2007, Wheatcroft via the holding company Wheatcroft &amp; Son Ltd, sold a 150-year lease on the land on which the track and museum are located to Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd (DVLL).

In July 2008, it was announced that DVLL had won the rights to the British Grand Prix for 17 years from July 2010, with North West Leicestershire council approving plans for the required track and facility rebuilt design by Hermann Tilke to be constructed from January 2009.

On 27 and 28 September 2008, the Motocross des Nations, the biggest and longest running event in World Championship Motocross, was at Donington Park.

It soon became clear that DVLL, led by Simon Gillett, was in serious financial difficulty. Chris Sylt, a respected journalist specialising in the financial side of Formula One, questioned Simon Gillett&#x27;s track record, citing an earlier failure of his company Innovation Motorsport, owing £200,000, and his apparent lack of experience.

In April 2009, Wheatcroft &amp; Son Ltd took legal action against DVLL in Derby County Court, seeking £2.47m in rent arrears, as well as forfeiture of the lease. The legal action put the future of the British Grand Prix in doubt, with Bernie Ecclestone restating that if Donington did not meet required standards to host the event, there will be no British Grand Prix from 2010.

On 5 June 2009, it was announced that an out of court settlement had been reached between Wheatcroft &amp; Son Ltd and DVLL.

On 24 October 2009, media sources reported that Donington had failed to raise the £135 million needed to stage a British Grand Prix. The BBC commented in its coverage that: &quot;Donington&#x27;s bid looks over, and that Ecclestone has offered the race to Silverstone.&quot; Although DVLL gave further public relations assurance that it would be able to raise the required finance and host the Grand Prix, on 29 October 2009, Ecclestone confirmed that the British Grand Prix would not be held at Donington.

On 18 November 2009, the company went into administration with debts to contractors and suppliers approaching £4 million and a secured loan of £14 million with Anglo Irish Bank, according to the Administrator&#x27;s report. Acting chairman Mr Price said: &quot;This need not be the end of Formula One racing at Donington. It still remains a fantastic location. It needs people of vision to get the dream to the starting grid. We are certainly hopeful that a 2011 Grand Prix could take place at the site.&quot;

On 7 December 2009, Formula One Management announced that Silverstone had been awarded a 17-year contract to hold the British Grand Prix from 2010 until 2026.

On 11 December 2009, it was announced that DVLL had lost the rights to hold the British Superbike Championship race due to be held on 10–12 September 2010. These dates will now be used for a race at Croft.

===Return to Wheatcroft family (2009–2017)===

On 24 December 2009 it was announced that a buyer for Donington Ventures Leisure had not been found, which thus meant that the 150-year lease given by Wheatcroft &amp; Son Ltd to Donington Ventures Leisure was terminated. The ownership immediately reverted to Wheatcroft &amp; Son Ltd, now led by Kevin Wheatcroft in light of the death of his father in 2009. Wheatcroft vowed to re-open Donington Park as soon as possible. There were hopes to re-open the circuit in August 2010, and this was accomplished with the Donington Revival meeting.

On 26 May 2010 Wheatcroft announced that the lease for Donington Park had been sold (Subject To Contract) to Worcestershire-based Adroit Group. Adroit proceeded to resurrect the circuit, not only rebuilding the removed track sections, but also renewing infrastructure. This included the re-alignment of Foggy&#x27;s bend, but not the old Dunlop Bridge due to new built MSA/FIA regulations. As a result of a series of inspections, the circuit successfully regained its ACU, MSA and FIA Grade 2 licences. However, Wheatcrofts and Adroit failed to agree terms of a final lease contract, and hence terminated their outline agreement.

The Wheatcroft-owned company Donington Park Racing took control of the circuit in late 2010, gaining events from both World Touring Cars and the World Superbikes, plus the inaugural Donington Historic Festival.

60 race days are held each year, including events from the British Touring Car Championship, British Superbikes, World Superbikes, British GT, rallying and historic festivals for both cars and motorcycles. Racing takes place on most weekends between March and October, with visits from most British racing clubs. Donington has also been host to the annual Season Launch for the BTCC since 2013, while the British Superbike Championship also holds major test days at the circuit.

The FIA Formula E Championship and its teams also constructed its headquarters at the circuit in the early years of its competition. All teams in the electric series were based at the venue, and Donington hosted several pre-season test dates before each season, some of which were open to spectators. For the 2017–18 season, the series switched their pre-season test venue to the Circuit Ricardo Tormo in Valencia, Spain.

Wheatcroft has also invested heavily to restore the circuit infrastructure to its former glories. The infield which was excavated during the late 2000s has been completely restored and raised even higher in some areas, while pit and paddock facilities have also been improved. Outside the circuit boundaries, an all terrain course has been constructed, as well as improvements to hospitality buildings and conferencing suites.

=== Purchase by MotorSport Vision (2017–present) ===
In January 2017, the circuit business was taken over by MotorSport Vision, with the Donington Park Estate on a 21-year lease, until 2038. The purchase was cleared by the Competition and Markets Authority in August 2017, with work commencing almost immediately on venue improvements.

Additions over the winter period of 2017-18 included a full resurface of paddock areas and access roads, the addition of the Garage 39 Restaurant, cafe and bar, and a large new grandstand at Hollywood corner. Several old toilet blocks were also demolished to make way for more modern units. while detail changes were carried out around the venue. The circuit office was also relocated to a newer building within the paddock.

For 2019, work was completed on a new main entrance area near the existing paddock entrance, that better separates pedestrians from vehicle traffic.

In April 2021 MSV announced it had purchased the freehold of the Donington Hall Estate comprising Donington Hall itself, former office building Hastings House and the Lansdowne workshops building. The estate is set in 28 acres of grounds next to the Donington Park race circuit. MSV plans to develop the Grade II* listed Hall into a 40-bedroom hotel, scheduled to open in 2023. Hastings House will become the Donington Hall Motorhouse, a stabling facility for supercars, classic road and racing cars and motorcycles, whilst the Lansdowne workshops, will be available to let for high-end motor engineering businesses which support the preparation and maintenance of vehicles kept at the Donington Hall Motorhouse and used on the race circuit.

==Motorsport at Donington==

Donington Park has long been home to many prestigious motorsport events including BTCC, British F3, British Superbike Championship, WorldSBK, Superleague Formula, Truck Racing.

===Formula One===

====1993 European Grand Prix====
Donington Park was the host of the 1993 European Grand Prix on 11 April 1993. The race, which was affected by rain, was notable for the dominance of Ayrton Senna where he won the race by over 1 minute from Damon Hill, having advanced from fifth to first in the opening lap.

This race was described by AtlasF1 as the &#x27;Drive of the Decade&#x27;. There is a memorial to Senna in the grounds of the racetrack, outside the Donington Collections.

====Failed 2010 British Grand Prix bid====

On 4 July 2008 Bernie Ecclestone announced that Donington Park would hold the British Grand Prix from onwards in a 17-year deal, having been hosted exclusively by Silverstone since 1987. On 10 July 2008, the proposal was that the track would have a major upgrade designed by Hermann Tilke, to include an entirely new pit complex along Starkey&#x27;s Straight and increasing the circuit length to , by the addition of a new infield loop, to get it up to the standards required for modern day Formula One racing.

The proposal included that the racetrack would be the first to be accessed only by public transportation, with viewers&#x27; cars not being allowed to enter the facility. This was in part an answer to the lack of road access, which regularly resulted in long tailbacks, for example when 30,000 bikers exited major motorcycle events. A shuttle-bus service would run from the close by East Midlands Parkway station, on the Midland Main Line from London to Sheffield.

Due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis and Donington&#x27;s potential inability to raise the necessary funds, Bernie Ecclestone stated on 20 June 2009 that the 2010 British Grand Prix would be held at Silverstone if Donington was not ready to host it. This was a change from his previous &quot;Donington or nothing&quot; standpoint and he cited changes in the structure of the BRDC, meaning there was a better way of negotiating with them over future commercial rights. Furthermore, during an interview with the BBC about the Formula One Teams Association threatening to break away and form their own series, FIA president Max Mosley said it was &quot;highly likely&quot; the 2010 British Grand Prix would return to Silverstone.

Donington was given an extended two-week deadline to prove their financing to host the 2010 British Grand Prix. This did not work out, as fundraising attempts fell through on 22 October 2009. Consequently, Bernie Ecclestone confirmed a few days after, that Donington would not be hosting the British Grand Prix.

On 18 November 2009, less than one month after it was confirmed that the Donington had lost the right to host the British Grand Prix, circuit owner Donington Ventures Leisure Limited was placed into administration. Ecclestone initially had promised potential new owners the option of reviving the deal, but in December 2009 Silverstone won the contract for the next 17 years.

===Motorcycle Grands Prix (1987–2009)===
Donington Park has also been the home of Grand Prix motorcycle racing. After the Isle of Man TT Races lost World Championship status, from the 1977 UK inaugural race, GP racing was held at Silverstone until 1986. For the next 23 years, Donington held the race up until 2009, but in light of the proposed Donington Formula 1 deal, Grand Prix organisers Dorna Sports agreed a five-year deal with Silverstone from 2010. Following the failed 2010 Formula 1 bid, in less than a year Donington had lost both competitions for the foreseeable future.

Donington Park was proposed to host the British Grand Prix as an alternative venue chosen for 2015, since the Circuit of Wales, having won the Dorna contract from 2015, was a failed proposal. However, in February 2015, it was announced that Donington had called off the deal, and that 2015 Grands Prix would likely remain at Silverstone.

===British Touring Car Championship (BTCC)===
Donington Park has been a mainstay of the BTCC calendar, since the series was created in 1987 (as a development from the previous British Saloon Car Championship). In 1999 Donington was the location of one of the standout events from the BTCC&#x27;s Super Touring era. Matt Neal caused a sensation by winning a race in his Nissan Primera, the first &#x27;Independent&#x27; to do so in the modern era. This won him a £250,000 prize from BTCC series promoter Alan Gow.

===FIA World Touring Car Championship (2011)===
After five years at Brands Hatch, the WTCC moved to Donington Park in 2011. The event attracted thousands of people on race day, where the two races were both won by Yvan Muller for Chevrolet. The weekend also had two races for the Auto GP series as well as the Maserati Trofeo. The 2012 WTCC season did not include a UK-based round of the competition.

===DTM===
Donington hosted rounds of the German DTM (Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters) series in 2002 and 2003. Former F1 driver Jean Alesi secured a clean sweep of wins across both years for AMG Mercedes.

===Rallying===
The Park hosted a stage of the 1989 RAC Rally. Donington is the venue for two rallies, with one of the events being a round of the MSN Circuit Rally Championship. These events do not take place exclusively on the circuit, including sections on the looser sections surrounding the track itself.

===Sports cars / GTs===
Donington was one of the venues for the 2001 European Le Mans Series season. It was a series for Le Mans Prototypes (LMP) and Grand Touring (GT) race cars run by IMSA. The ill-fated series began in March 2001 and ended in October that year after only seven races. The Donington winner was Audi Sport Team Joest with drivers Tom Kristensen and Rinaldo Capello.

Donington was also a venue for races in the FIA GT Championship from 1997 to 1999 and then 2002 to 2004.

===Lap records===

The unofficial all-time track record set during a race weekend is 1:10.458, set by Alain Prost in a Williams FW15C, during second (final) qualifying for the 1993 European Grand Prix. As of September 2024, the fastest official race lap records at the Donington Park Circuit are listed as:

===Layout history===
==Incidents==
On 16 April 2017, British racing driver Billy Monger was critically injured after being involved in a racing car crash. His car slammed into a stationary car containing Patrik Pasma. Monger was conscious after the crash. Pasma was not seriously injured in the crash. Both drivers were sent directly to two hospitals. Both of Monger’s legs were amputated afterwards in the hospital.

==Other events==
Beside motorsports, many other events are held at Donington. The 1975 BMF Rally was held in the grounds with period reports of 10,000 motorcycle riders attending.

Other events included music festivals such as the Download Festival, and the Donington Grand Prix Museum exhibition until it closed down in November 2018. The Donington Park Sunday Market used to be held in the grounds of the park for nearly 40 years before being closed down in September 2016, the owners citing changing shopping habits contributing to fewer traders and customers.

===Music festivals===

Donington Park has a long history of holding rock festivals having played host to the Monsters of Rock festival from 1980 to the mid 90s, when groups such as Van Halen, Bon Jovi, AC/DC, Metallica, and Iron Maiden performed there. With a few years off the park then played host to Stereophonics&#x27; &quot;A Day At The Races&quot; event and the Rock and Blues Festival in 2001, and the Ozzfest in 2002.

In 2003, the Download Festival (owned and operated by Live Nation) began annually at the venue and continues to an increased three-day event with five stages, though as of 2008 the event is now held outside of the track boundary.

Donington Park was the venue for the biggest rave to ever take place in the United Kingdom, when music promotor Fantazia held their &#x27;One Step Beyond&#x27; event there in 1992. 25,000 tickets were sold, but police estimated that 3000 people had entered without tickets.

===Donington Grand Prix Exhibition===
The Donington Grand Prix Exhibition first opened to the public in March 1973. Five halls, with over 130 exhibits, illustrated the history of motor sport from the turn of the 20th century. Cars included examples driven by such famous names as Nuvolari, Mansell, Prost, Moss, Senna, Fangio, Clark and Stewart. The Donington Grand Prix Exhibition housed a collection of McLaren and Vanwalls racing cars. Notable exhibits included the 1936 twin engined Alfa Romeo Bimotore which had a top speed of , Jim Clark&#x27;s World Championship winning Lotus 25, the &#x27;howling&#x27; flat 12 Ferrari 312B, and Stirling Moss&#x27;s Lotus, in which he defeated the Ferrari works team in the 1961 Monaco Grand Prix. The Collection also featured the World&#x27;s largest collection of Driver&#x27;s Helmets. There were several different type of simulators that allowed users to experience the thrills of racing at speed.

After closing briefly in 2009 following the death of Tom Wheatcroft and Donington Ventures Leisure Ltd. entering administration, the exhibition reopened on 6 January 2010 along with the cafe and race control offices. With dwindling visitor numbers, and not being part of the core MSV business plan, the museum closed permanently on 5 November 2018.

==Location==
Donington Park lies south west of Nottingham, south east of Derby and is situated in Leicestershire. It is a matter of a few yards/metres east of the border with Derbyshire and indeed has a Derby postcode and telephone code. The western end of the runway at East Midlands Airport is just 400 yards from the eastern end of the racing track. It is also fairly close to the M1.

East Midlands Parkway railway station and Derby Midland Station are close by and the owners have expressed their desire for spectators to use these stations and coaches to the circuit. The owners are also in support of any future light rail transport to East Midlands Airport itself.

Donington Hall was, for a time, the HQ of the airline British Midland International (later known as BMI).

==Media==
Donington Park has been simulated and can be driven in several racing simulations, such as &quot;Spirit of Speed 1937&quot; (the 1937 version of the track is featured, as the name suggests). Another 1937 layout features in the popular &quot;rFactor&quot; simulation. This version is far more accurate than that of the &quot;Spirit of Speed&quot; version. The track also features in &quot;Sports Car GT&quot;, &quot;Le Mans 24 Hours&quot;, &quot;ToCA Touring Car Championship&quot;, &quot;ToCA 2 Touring Cars&quot;, &quot;ToCA Race Driver&quot;, &quot;ToCA Race Driver 2&quot;, &quot;TOCA Race Driver 3&quot;, &quot;Alfa Romeo Racing Italiano&quot;, &quot;GTR&quot;, &quot;GTR2&quot;, &quot;GT Legends&quot;, &quot;F1 Challenge &#x27;99-&#x27;02&quot; (with a mod), &quot;Grand Prix 4&quot; (1993 configuration, unofficial add-on track), &quot;MotoGP 3&quot;, &quot;Redline&quot;, &quot;rFactor&quot;, &quot;SBK-07&quot;, &quot;Race Driver: GRID&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed: Shift&quot;, &quot;iRacing&quot;, &quot;Assetto Corsa&quot; (as a mod), &quot;Assetto Corsa Competizione&quot; (in British GT pack DLC), &quot;Automobilista 2&quot;, and &quot;Project CARS&quot;. Donington Park also appears as a venue in the game &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;.

<text>77 (seventy-seven) is the natural number following 76 and preceding 78. Seventy-seven is the smallest positive integer requiring five syllables in English.

==In mathematics==
77 is:
*the 22nd discrete semiprime and the first of the (7.q) family, where q is a higher prime.
* with a prime aliquot sum of 19 within an aliquot sequence (77, 19, 1, 0) to the Prime in the 19-aliquot tree. 77 is the second composite member of the 19-aliquot tree with 65
*a Blum integer since both 7 and 11 are Gaussian primes.
*the sum of three consecutive squares, 42 + 52 + 62.
*the sum of the first eight prime numbers.
*the number of integer partitions of the number 12.
* the largest number that cannot be written as a sum of distinct numbers whose reciprocals sum to 1.
*the number of digits of the 12th perfect number.

It is possible for a sudoku puzzle to have as many as 77 givens, yet lack a unique solution.

It and 49 are the only 2-digit numbers whose home primes (in base 10) have not been calculated.

==In history==
During World War II in Sweden at the border with Norway, &quot;77&quot; was used as a shibboleth (password), because the tricky pronunciation in Swedish made it easy to instantly discern whether the speaker was native Swedish, Norwegian, or German.

==In religion==
In the Islamic tradition, &quot;77&quot; figures prominently. Muhammad is reported to have explained, &quot;Faith has sixty-odd, or seventy-odd branches, the highest and best of which is to declare and believe that there is no god but Allah without any equals or highers and anyone worthy of worship, and the lowest of which is to remove something harmful from a road. Shyness, too, is a branch of faith.&quot; While some scholars refrain from clarifying &quot;sixty-odd or seventy-odd&quot;, various numbers have been suggested, 77 being the most common. Some have gone so far as to delineate these branches.

===In religious numerology===
In certain numerological systems based on the English alphabet, the number 77 is associated with Jesus Christ. CHRIST is C = 3, H = 8, R = 18, I = 9, S = 19, T = 20, which added together equal 77.

==In other fields==
Seventy-seven is also:
* 10-77, the New York City Fire Department&#x27;s (FDNY) 10 code for high-rise, multiple-dwelling fire

<text>79 (seventy-nine) is the natural number following 78 and preceding 80.

==In mathematics==
79 is:

* An odd number.
* The smallest number that can not be represented as a sum of fewer than 19 fourth powers.
* The 22nd prime number (between and )
* An isolated prime without a twin prime, as 77 and 81 are composite.
* The smallest prime number &quot;p&quot; for which the real quadratic field Q[] has class number greater than 1 (namely 3).
* A cousin prime with 83.
* An emirp in base 10, because the reverse of 79, 97, is also a prime.
* A Fortunate prime.
* A circular prime.
* A prime number that is also a Gaussian prime (since it is of the form ).
* A happy prime.
* A Higgs prime.
* A lucky prime.
* A permutable prime, with ninety-seven.
* A Pillai prime, because 23! + 1 is divisible by 79, but 79 is not one more than a multiple of 23.
* A regular prime.
* A right-truncatable prime, because when the last digit (9) is removed, the remaining number (7) is still prime.
* A sexy prime (with 73).
* The &quot;n&quot; value of the Wagstaff prime 201487636602438195784363.
* Similarly to how the decimal expansion of 1/89 gives Fibonacci numbers, 1/79 gives Pell numbers, that is, formula_1
* A Leyland number of the second kind and Leyland prime of the second kind, using 2 &amp; 7 (formula_2)

<doc id="391889" wikidata="Q4689697" url="?curid=391889" title="African Americans in the United States Congress">
<text>From the first United States Congress in 1789 through the 116th Congress in 2020, 162 African Americans served in Congress. Meanwhile, the total number of all individuals who have served in Congress over that period is 12,348. Between 1789 and 2020, 152 have served in the House of Representatives, nine have served in the Senate, and one has served in both chambers. Voting members have totaled 156, while six others have served as delegates. Party membership has been 131 Democrats and 31 Republicans. While 13 members founded the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971 during the 92nd Congress, in the 116th Congress (2019-2020), 56 served, with 54 Democrats and two Republicans (total seats are 535, plus six delegates). 

By the time of the first edition of the House sponsored book, &quot;Black Americans in Congress&quot;, in the bicentennial year of 1976, 45 African Americans had served in Congress throughout history; that rose to 66 by the second edition in 1990, and there were further sustained increases in both the 2008 and 2018 editions. The first African American to serve was Senator Hiram Revels in 1870. The first African American to chair a congressional committee was Representative William L. Dawson in 1949. The first African-American woman was Representative Shirley Chisholm in 1968, and the first African American to become Dean of the House was John Conyers in 2015. The first African American to become party leader in either chamber of congress was Hakeem Jeffries in 2023. One member, then Senator Barack Obama, went from the Senate to President of the United States in 2009. 
The first African Americans to serve in the Congress were Republicans elected during the Reconstruction Era. After the 13th and 14th Amendments granted freedom and citizenship to enslaved people, freedmen gained political representation in the Southern United States for the first time. In response to the growing numbers of black statesmen and politicians, white Democrats turned to violence and intimidation to regain their political power. 

By the presidential election of 1876, only three state legislatures were not controlled by whites. The Compromise of 1877 completed the period of Redemption by white Southerners, with the withdrawal of federal troops from the South. State legislatures began to pass Jim Crow laws to establish racial segregation and restrict labor rights, movement, and organizing by black people. They passed some laws to restrict voter registration, aimed at suppressing the black vote. From 1890 to 1908, state legislatures in the South essentially disfranchised most black people and many poor white people from voting by passing new constitutions or amendments or other laws related to more restrictive electoral and voter registration and electoral rules. As a result of the Civil Rights Movement, the U.S. Congress passed laws in the mid-1960s to end segregation and enforce constitutional civil rights and voting rights.

As Republicans accommodated the end of Reconstruction becoming more ambiguous on civil rights and with the rise of the Republican lily-white movement, African Americans began shifting away from the Republican Party. During two waves of massive migration within the United States in the first half of the 20th century, more than six million African Americans moved from the South to Northeastern, Midwestern, and Western industrial cities, with five million migrating from 1940 to 1970. Some were elected to federal political office from these new locations, and most were elected as Democrats. During the Great Depression, many black voters switched allegiances from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, in support of the New Deal economic, social network and work policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. This trend continued through the 1960s civil rights legislation, when voting rights returned to the South, to present.

==History of black representation==

===Reconstruction and Redemption===
The right of black people to vote and to serve in the United States Congress was established after the Civil War by amendments to the Constitution. The Thirteenth Amendment (ratified December 6, 1865), abolished slavery. The Fourteenth Amendment (ratified July 9, 1868) made all people born or naturalized in the United States citizens. The Fifteenth Amendment (ratified February 3, 1870) forbade the denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude, and gave Congress the power to enforce the law by appropriate legislation.

The first black person to address Congress was Henry Highland Garnet, in 1865, on occasion of the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment.

In 1866, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act and the four Reconstruction Acts, which dissolved all governments in the former Confederate states with the exception of Tennessee. It divided the South into five military districts, where the military through the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau helped protect the rights and safety of newly freed black people. The act required that the former Confederate states ratify their constitutions conferring citizenship rights on black people or forfeit their representation in Congress.

As a result of these measures, black people acquired the right to vote across the Southern states. In several states (notably Mississippi and South Carolina), black people were the majority of the population. By forming coalitions with pro-Union white people, Republicans took control of the state legislatures. At the time, state legislatures elected the members of the U.S. Senate. During Reconstruction, only the state legislature of Mississippi elected any black senators. On February 25, 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels was seated as the first black member of the Senate, while Blanche Bruce, also of Mississippi, seated in 1875, was the second. Revels was the first black member of the Congress overall.

Black people were a majority of the population in many congressional districts across the South. In 1870, Joseph Rainey of South Carolina was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, becoming the first directly elected black member of Congress to be seated. Black people were elected to national office also from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia.

All of these Reconstruction era black senators and representatives were members of the Republican Party. The Republicans represented the party of Abraham Lincoln and of emancipation. The Democrats represented the party of planters, slavery and secession.

From 1868, Southern elections were accompanied by increasing violence, especially in Louisiana, Mississippi and the Carolinas, in an effort by Democrats to suppress black voting and regain power. In the mid-1870s, paramilitary groups such as the White League and Red Shirts worked openly to turn Republicans out of office and intimidate black people from voting. This followed the earlier years of secret vigilante action by the Ku Klux Klan against freedmen and allied white people.

After the disputed Presidential election of 1876 between Democratic Samuel J. Tilden, governor of New York, and Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, governor of Ohio, a national agreement between Democratic and Republican factions was negotiated, resulting in the Compromise of 1877. Under the compromise, Democrats conceded the election to Hayes and promised to acknowledge the political rights of black people; Republicans agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South and promised to appropriate a portion of federal monies toward Southern projects.

===Disenfranchisement===
With the Southern states &quot;redeemed&quot;, Democrats gradually regained control of Southern legislatures. They proceeded to restrict the rights of the majority of black people and many poor white people to vote by imposing new requirements for poll taxes, subjective literacy tests, more strict residency requirements and other elements difficult for laborers to satisfy.

By the 1880s, legislators increased restrictions on black voters through voter registration and election rules. In 1888 John Mercer Langston, president of Virginia State University at Petersburg, was elected to the U.S. Congress as the first African American from Virginia. He would also be the last for nearly a century, as the state passed a disenfranchising constitution at the turn of the century that excluded black people from politics for decades.

Starting with the Florida Constitution of 1885, white Democrats passed new constitutions in ten Southern states with provisions that restricted voter registration and forced hundreds of thousands of people from registration rolls. These changes effectively prevented most black people and many poor white people from voting. Many white people who were also illiterate were exempted from such requirements as literacy tests by such strategies as the grandfather clause, basing eligibility on an ancestor&#x27;s voting status as of 1866, for instance.

Southern state and local legislatures also passed Jim Crow laws that segregated transportation, public facilities, and daily life. Finally, racial violence in the form of lynchings and race riots increased in frequency, reaching a peak in the last decade of the 19th century.

The last black congressman elected from the South in the 19th century was George Henry White of North Carolina, elected in 1896 and re-elected in 1898. His term expired in 1901, the same year that William McKinley, who was the last president to have fought in the Civil War, died. No black people served in Congress for the next 28 years, and none represented any Southern state for the next 72 years.

==The modern era==
From 1910 to 1940, the Great Migration of black people from the rural South to Northern cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland began to produce black-majority Congressional districts in the North. In the North, black people could exercise their right to vote. In the two waves of the Great Migration through 1970, more than six and a half million black people moved north and west and became highly urbanized.

In 1928, Oscar De Priest won the 1st Congressional District of Illinois (the South Side of Chicago) as a Republican, becoming the first black congressman of the modern era. Arthur Wergs Mitchell became the first African-American Democrat elected to Congress, part of the New Deal Coalition, when he replaced De Priest in 1935 after having defeated him in the prior year&#x27;s general election. De Priest, Mitchell and their eventual successor, William Dawson, were the only African Americans in Congress up to the mid-1940s, when additional black Democrats began to be elected in Northern cities. In 1949, Dawson became the first African American in history to chair a congressional committee. De Priest was the last African-American Republican elected to the House for 58 years, until Gary Franks was elected to represent Connecticut&#x27;s 5th in 1990. Franks was joined by J.C. Watts in 1994 but lost his bid for reelection two years later. After Watts retired in 2003, the House had no black Republicans until 2011, with the 2010 elections of Allen West in Florida&#x27;s 22nd and Tim Scott in South Carolina&#x27;s 1st. West lost his reelection bid in 2012, while Scott resigned in January 2013 to accept appointment to the U.S. Senate. Two new black Republicans, Will Hurd of Texas&#x27;s 23rd district and Mia Love of Utah&#x27;s 4th district, were elected in 2014, with Love being the first ever black Republican woman to be elected to Congress. She lost reelection in 2018, leaving Hurd as the only black Republican member of the U.S. House. Hurd forwent reelection in 2020, but two black Republicans were elected to the House that year: Byron Donalds in Florida and Burgess Owens in Utah. In 2022, African-American Republicans Wesley Hunt and John James were elected to the House from Texas and Michigan, respectively, and there currently are four black Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives.

The election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932 led to a shift of black voting loyalties from Republican to Democrat, as Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal programs offered economic relief to people suffering from the Great Depression. From 1940 to 1970, nearly five million black Americans moved north and also west, especially to California, in the second wave of the Great Migration. By the mid-1960s, an overwhelming majority of black voters were Democrats, and most were voting in states outside the former Confederacy.

It was not until after passage by Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the result of years of effort on the part of African Americans and allies in the Civil Rights Movement, that black people within the Southern states recovered their ability to exercise their rights to vote and to live with full civil rights. While legal segregation ended, accomplishing voter registration and redistricting to implement the sense of the law took more time.

On January 3, 1969, Shirley Chisholm was sworn as the nation&#x27;s first African-American congresswoman. Two years later, she became one of the 13 founding members of the Congressional Black Caucus. 

Until 1992, most black House members were elected from inner-city districts in the North and West: New York City, Newark, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, St. Louis and Los Angeles all elected at least one black member. Following the 1990 census, Congressional districts needed to be redrawn due to the population shifts of the country. Various federal court decisions resulted in states redistricting to provide some districts where the majority of the population was composed of African Americans, rather than gerrymandering to exclude black majorities.

Both parties have used gerrymandering to gain political advantage by drawing districts to favor their own party. Some districts were created to link widely separated black communities. As a result, several black Democratic members of the House were elected from new districts in Alabama, Florida, rural Georgia, rural Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia for the first time since Reconstruction. Additional black-majority districts were also created in this way in California, Maryland and Texas, thus increasing the number of black-majority districts.

The creation of black-majority districts was a process supported by both parties. The Democrats saw it as a means of providing social justice, as well as connecting easily to black voters who had been voting Democratic for decades. The Republicans believed they gained by the change, as many of the Democratic voters were moved out of historically Republican-majority districts. By 2000, other demographic and cultural changes resulted in the Republican Party holding a majority of white-majority House districts.

Since the 1940s, when decades of the Great Migration resulted in millions of African Americans having migrated from the South, no state has had a majority of African-American residents. Nine African Americans have served in the Senate since the 1940s: Edward W. Brooke, a Republican from Massachusetts; Carol Moseley Braun, Barack Obama and Roland Burris (appointed to fill a vacancy), all Democrats from Illinois; Tim Scott (initially appointed to fill a vacancy, but later elected), a Republican from South Carolina; Mo Cowan (appointed to fill a vacancy), a Democrat from Massachusetts; Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey; Kamala Harris, a Democrat from California; and Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia.

<text>Nomenclature (, ) is a system of names or terms, or the rules for forming these terms in a particular field of arts or sciences. (The theoretical field studying nomenclature is sometimes referred to as &quot;onymology&quot; or &quot;taxonymy&quot; ). The principles of naming vary from the relatively informal conventions of everyday speech to the internationally agreed principles, rules, and recommendations that govern the formation and use of the specialist terminology used in scientific and any other disciplines.

Naming &quot;things&quot; is a part of general human communication using words and language: it is an aspect of everyday taxonomy as people distinguish the objects of their experience, together with their similarities and differences, which observers identify, name and . The use of names, as the many different kinds of nouns embedded in different languages, connects nomenclature to theoretical linguistics, while the way humans mentally structure the world in relation to word meanings and experience relates to the philosophy of language.

Onomastics, the study of proper names and their origins, includes: anthroponymy (concerned with human names, including personal names, surnames and nicknames); toponymy (the study of place names); and etymology (the derivation, history and use of names) as revealed through comparative and descriptive linguistics.

The scientific need for simple, stable and internationally accepted systems for naming objects of the natural world has generated many formal nomenclatural systems. Probably the best known of these nomenclatural systems are the five codes of biological nomenclature that govern the Latinized scientific names of organisms.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;nomenclature&quot; is derived from the Latin word (&#x27;name&#x27;), and (&#x27;to call&#x27;). The Latin term refers to a list of names, as does the word &quot;nomenclator&quot;, which can also indicate a provider or announcer of names.

==Onomastics and nomenclature==

The study of proper names is known as &quot;onomastics&quot;, which has a wide-ranging scope that encompasses all names, languages, and geographical regions, as well as cultural areas.

The distinction between onomastics and nomenclature is not readily clear: onomastics is an unfamiliar discipline to most people, and the use of nomenclature in an academic sense is also not commonly known. Although the two fields integrate, nomenclature concerns itself more with the rules and conventions that are used for the formation of names.

== Influence of social, political, religious factors ==
Due to social, political, religious, and cultural motivations, things that are the same may be given different names, while different things may be given the same name; closely related similar things may be considered separate, while on the other hand significantly different things might be considered the same.

For example, Hindi and Urdu are both closely related, mutually intelligible Hindustani languages (one being sanskritised and the other arabised). However, they are favored as separate languages by Hindus and Muslims respectively, as seen in the context of Hindu-Muslim conflict resulting in the violence of the 1947 Partition of India. In contrast, mutually unintelligible dialects that differ considerably in structure, such as Moroccan Arabic, Yemeni Arabic, and Lebanese Arabic, are considered to be the same language due to the pan-Islamism religious identity.

==Cultural nomenclature==

Names provide us with a way of structuring and mapping the world in our minds so, in some way, they mirror or represent the objects of our experience.

===Names, words, language, meaning===

Elucidating the connections between language (especially names and nouns), meaning, and the way we perceive the world has provided a rich field of study for philosophers and linguists. Relevant areas of study include: the distinction between proper names and proper nouns; as well as the relationship between names, their referents, meanings (semantics), and the structure of language.

===Folk taxonomy===

Modern scientific taxonomy has been described as &quot;basically a Renaissance codification of folk taxonomic principles&quot;.&quot;&quot;
Formal systems of scientific nomenclature and are exemplified by biological classification. All classification systems are established for a purpose. The scientific classification system anchors each organism within the nested hierarchy of internationally accepted classification categories. Maintenance of this system involves formal rules of nomenclature and periodic international meetings of review. This modern system evolved from the folk taxonomy of prehistory.

Folk taxonomy can be illustrated through the Western tradition of horticulture and gardening. Unlike scientific taxonomy, folk taxonomies serve many purposes. Examples in horticulture would be the grouping of plants, and naming of these groups, according to their properties and uses:

* annuals, biennials and perennials (nature of life cycle);
* vegetables, fruits, culinary herbs and spices (culinary use);
* herbs, trees and shrubs (growth habit); 
* wild and cultivated plants (whether they are managed or not); and
* weeds (whether they are considered to be a nuisance or not), etc.

Folk Taxonomy is generally associated with the way rural or indigenous peoples use language to make sense of and organise the objects around them. Ethnobiology frames this interpretation through either &quot;utilitarianists&quot; like Bronislaw Malinowski who maintain that names and classifications reflect mainly material concerns, and &quot;intellectualists&quot; like Claude Lévi-Strauss who hold that they spring from innate mental processes. The literature of ethnobiological classifications was reviewed in 2006. Folk classification is defined by the way in which members of a language community name and categorize plants and animals whereas ethnotaxonomy refers to the hierarchical structure, organic content, and cultural function of biological classification that ethnobiologists find in every society around the world.

Ethnographic studies of the naming and classification of animals and plants in non-Western societies have revealed some general principles that suggest pre-scientific man&#x27;s conceptual and linguistic method of organising the biological world in a hierarchical way. Such studies indicate that the urge to classify is a basic human instinct.

:*in all languages natural groups of organisms are distinguished (present-day taxa)
:*these groups are arranged into more inclusive groups or ethnobiological categories
:*in all languages there are about five or six ethnobiological categories of graded inclusiveness
:*these groups (ethnobiological categories) are arranged hierarchically, generally into mutually exclusive ranks
:*the ranks at which particular organisms are named and classified is often similar in different cultures

The levels, moving from the most to least inclusive, are:

#&quot;unique beginner&quot; — e.g. &quot;plant&quot; or &quot;animal&quot;. A single all-inclusive name rarely used in folk taxonomies but loosely equivalent to an original living thing, a &quot;common ancestor&quot;
#&quot;life form&quot; — e.g. &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;bird&quot;, &quot;grass&quot; and &quot;fish&quot;. These are usually primary lexemes (basic linguistic units) loosely equivalent to a phylum or major biological division.
#&quot;generic name&quot; — e.g. &quot;oak&quot;, &quot;pine&quot;, &quot;robin&quot;, &quot;catfish&quot;. This is the most numerous and basic building block of all folk taxonomies, the most frequently referred to, the most important psychologically, and among the first learned by children. These names can usually be associated directly with a second level group. Like life-form names these are primary lexemes.
#&quot;specific name&quot; — e.g. &quot;white fir&quot;, &quot;post oak&quot;. More or less equivalent to species. A secondary lexeme and generally less frequent than generic names.
#&quot;varietal name&quot; — e.g. &quot;baby lima bean&quot;, &quot;butter lima bean&quot;.

In almost all cultures objects are named using one or two words equivalent to &#x27;kind&#x27; (&quot;genus&quot;) and &#x27;particular kind&#x27; (&quot;species&quot;). When made up of two words (a &quot;binomial&quot;) the name usually consists of a noun (like &quot;salt&quot;, &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;star&quot;) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more &quot;specific&quot;, for example, &quot;lap dog&quot;, &quot;sea salt&quot;, or &quot;film star&quot;. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (&quot;whelk&quot;, &quot;elm&quot;, &quot;lion&quot;, &quot;shark&quot;, &quot;pig&quot;) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism&#x27;s use, appearance or other special properties (&quot;sting ray&quot;, &quot;poison apple&quot;, &quot;giant stinking hogweed&quot;, &quot;hammerhead shark&quot;). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like &quot;Simpson&quot; and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say &quot;Homer Simpson&quot;. It seems reasonable to assume that the form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names—but with the use of Latin as a universal language.

In keeping with the utilitarian view other authors maintain that ethnotaxonomies resemble more a &quot;complex web of resemblances&quot; than a neat hierarchy. Likewise, a recent study has suggested that some folk taxonomies display more than six ethnobiological categories. Others go further and even doubt the reality of such categories, especially those above the generic name level.

==Names and nouns==

A name is a label for any noun: names can identify a class or category of things; or a single thing, either uniquely or within a given context. Names are given, for example, to humans or any other organisms, places, products—as in brand names—and even to ideas or concepts. It is names as nouns that are the building blocks of nomenclature.

The word &quot;name&quot; is possibly derived from the Proto-Indo-European language hypothesised word . The distinction between names and nouns, if made at all, is extremely subtle, although clearly &quot;noun&quot; refers to names as lexical categories and their function within the context of language, rather that as &quot;labels&quot; for objects and properties.

===Personal names===

Human personal names, also referred to as &quot;prosoponyms&quot;, are presented, used and categorised in many ways depending on the language and culture. In most cultures (Indonesia is one exception) it is customary for individuals to be given at least two names. In Western culture, the first name is given at birth or shortly thereafter and is referred to as the given name, the forename, the baptismal name (if given then), or simply the first name. In England prior to the Norman invasion of 1066, small communities of Celts, Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians generally used single names: each person was identified by a single name as either a personal name or nickname. As the population increased, it gradually became necessary to identify people further—giving rise to names like John the butcher, Henry from Sutton, and Roger son of Richard...which naturally evolved into John Butcher, Henry Sutton, and Roger Richardson. We now know this additional name variously as the second name, last name, family name, surname or occasionally the byname, and this natural tendency was accelerated by the Norman tradition of using surnames that were fixed and hereditary within individual families. In combination these two names are now known as the personal name or, simply, the name. There are many exceptions to this general rule: Westerners often insert a third or more names between the given and surnames; Chinese and Hungarian names have the family name preceding the given name; females now often retain their maiden names (their family surname) or combine, using a hyphen, their maiden name and the surname of their husband; some East Slavic nations insert the patronym (a name derived from the given name of the father) between the given and the family name; in Iceland the given name is used with the patronym, or matronym (a name derived from the given name of the mother), and surnames are rarely used. Nicknames (sometimes called hypocoristic names) are informal names used mostly between friends.

===Common names and proper names===

The distinction between proper names and common names is that proper names denote a unique entity e.g. London Bridge, while common names are used in a more general sense in reference to a class of objects e.g. bridge. Many proper names are obscure in meaning as they lack any apparent meaning in the way that ordinary words mean, probably for the practical reason that when they consist of Collective nouns, they refer to groups, even when they are inflected for the singular e.g. &quot;committee&quot;. Concrete nouns like &quot;cabbage&quot; refer to physical bodies that can be observed by at least one of the senses while abstract nouns, like &quot;love&quot; and &quot;hate&quot; refer to abstract objects. In English, many abstract nouns are formed by adding noun-forming suffixes (&#x27;-ness&#x27;, &#x27;-ity&#x27;, &#x27;-tion&#x27;) to adjectives or verbs e.g. &quot;happiness&quot;, &quot;serenity&quot;, &quot;concentration.&quot; Pronouns like &quot;he&quot;, &quot;it&quot;, &quot;which&quot;, and &quot;those&quot; stand in place of nouns in noun phrases.

The capitalization of nouns varies with language and even the particular context: journals often have their own house styles for common names.

===-onym nouns===

Distinctions may be made between particular kinds of names simply by using the suffix -onym, from the Greek &quot;ónoma&quot; (ὄνομα, &#x27;name&#x27;). So we have, for example, hydronyms name bodies of water, synonyms are names with the same meaning, and so on. The entire field could be described as chrematonymy—the names of things.

===Toponyms===

Toponyms are proper names given to various geographical features (geonyms), and also to cosmic features (cosmonyms). This could include names of mountains, rivers, seas, villages, towns, cities, countries, planets, stars etc. Toponymy can be further divided into specialist branches, like: choronymy, the study of proper names of regions and countries; econymy, the study of proper names of villages, towns and cities; hodonymy, the study of proper names of streets and roads; hydronymy, the study of proper names of water bodies; oronymy, the study of proper names of mountains and hills, etc.

Toponymy has popular appeal because of its socio-cultural and historical interest and significance for cartography. However, work on the etymology of toponyms has found that many place names are descriptive, honorific or commemorative but frequently they have no meaning, or the meaning is obscure or lost. Also, the many categories of names are frequently interrelated. For example, many place-names are derived from personal names (Victoria), many names of planets and stars are derived from the names of mythological characters (Venus, Neptune), and many personal names are derived from place-names, names of nations and the like (Wood, Bridge).

==Scientific nomenclature==

===Nomenclature, classification, identification===

In a strictly scientific sense, nomenclature is regarded as a part of &quot;taxonomy&quot; (though distinct from it). Moreover, the precision demanded by science in the accurate naming of objects in the natural world has resulted in a variety of codes of nomenclature (worldwide-accepted sets of rules on biological classification).

Taxonomy can be defined as the study of classification including its principles, procedures and rules, while classification itself is the ordering of taxa (the objects of classification) into groups based on similarities or differences. Doing taxonomy entails identifying, describing, and naming taxa; therefore, in the scientific sense, nomenclature is the branch of taxonomy concerned with the application of scientific names to taxa, based on a particular classification scheme, in accordance with agreed international rules and conventions.

Identification determines whether a particular organism matches a taxon that has already been classified and named – so classification must precede identification. This procedure is sometimes referred to as &quot;determination&quot;.

===Biology===

Although Linnaeus&#x27; system of binomial nomenclature was rapidly adopted after the publication of his Species Plantarum and Systema Naturae in 1753 and 1758 respectively, it was a long time before there was international consensus concerning the more general rules governing biological nomenclature. The first botanical code was produced in 1905, the zoological code in 1889 and cultivated plant code in 1953. Agreement on the nomenclature and symbols for genes emerged in 1979.

:*International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants
:*International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes
:*International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants
:*International Code of Zoological Nomenclature
:* Virus nomenclature – used in Virus classification
:* Enzyme nomenclature
:*PhyloCode (the International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature) – a recent code of biological nomenclature that took effect in 2020 (see also Phylogenetic nomenclature).
:* Terminologia Anatomica – international standard on human anatomic terminology
:*Gene nomenclature
:* Red Cell Nomenclature
:*Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) – used in medical devices.

===Astronomy===

Over the last few hundred years, the number of identified astronomical objects has risen from hundreds to over a billion, and more are discovered every year. Astronomers need universal systematic designations to unambiguously identify all of these objects using astronomical naming conventions, while assigning names to the most interesting objects and, where relevant, naming important or interesting features of those objects.

:* Planetary nomenclature
:* Meteorite nomenclature
:* International Astronomical Union

===Chemistry===

The IUPAC nomenclature is a system of naming chemical compounds and for describing the science of chemistry in general. It is maintained by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry.

* the &quot;Blue Book&quot; and the &quot;Red Book&quot;: the two publications containing the rules for naming organic and inorganic compounds.
* the &quot;Green Book&quot;, contains recommendations for the use of symbols for physical quantities (in association with the IUPAP)
* the &quot;Gold Book&quot;, defines a large number of technical terms used in chemistry.

Similar compendia exist for biochemistry (in association with the IUBMB), analytical chemistry and macromolecular chemistry. These books are supplemented by shorter recommendations for specific circumstances which are published from time to time in the journal &quot;Pure and Applied Chemistry&quot;. These systems can be accessed through the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).

===Other sciences===

* Metallurgy: the classic English translation of &quot;De re metallica&quot; includes an appendix (Appendix C) detailing problems of nomenclature in weights and measures.
* Physics: symbols, units and nomenclature.
* Archaeology: typology and archaeological record

<text>The Metropolitan Cathedral of the Most Precious Blood, informally known as Westminster Cathedral, is the largest Roman Catholic church in England and Wales. The shrine is dedicated to the Blood of Jesus Christ and is the seat of the Archbishop of Westminster.

The original site on which the cathedral stands in the City of Westminster was purchased by the Diocese of Westminster in 1885, and construction was completed in 1903. Designed by John Francis Bentley in a 9th-century Christian neo-Byzantine style, and accordingly made almost entirely of brick, without steel reinforcements, Sir John Betjeman called it &quot;a masterpiece in striped brick and stone&quot; that shows &quot;the good craftsman has no need of steel or concrete.&quot;

The cathedral merited an Apostolic Visit from Pope John Paul II on 28 May 1982 and Pope Benedict XVI in 18 September 2010. 

==History==
In the late 19th century, the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s hierarchy had only recently been restored in England and Wales, and it was in memory of Cardinal Wiseman (who died in 1865, and was the first Archbishop of Westminster from 1850) that the first substantial sum of money was raised for the new cathedral. The land was acquired in 1884 by Wiseman&#x27;s successor, Cardinal Manning, having previously been occupied by the second Tothill Fields Bridewell prison.

After two false starts, in 1867 (under architect Henry Clutton) and 1892 (architect Baron von Herstel), construction started in 1895 under Manning&#x27;s successor, the third archbishop, Cardinal Vaughan, with John Francis Bentley as architect, in a style heavily influenced by Byzantine architecture. The cost of the building was anticipated at £150,000 and its area 54,000 sq ft, the cathedral to be 350 ft long by 156 ft wide by 90 ft high.

The foundation stone blessing by Cardinal Vaughan took place on a Saturday morning, 29 June 1895, before a &quot;distinguished&quot; gathering. After the &quot;recitation of the Litanies, Cardinal Logue celebrated Low Mass &quot;coram episcopo&quot;. A procession composed of Benedictines, Franciscans, Jesuits, Passionists, Dominicans, Redemptorists, and secular clergy made the circuit of the grounds. The choir, directed by the Rev. Charles Cox, rendered, among other pieces, Webbe&#x27;s &#x27;O Roma Felix&#x27; and &#x27;O Salutaris&#x27;. At the luncheon which followed, the speakers included Cardinal Vaughan, Cardinal Logue, the Duke of Norfolk, Lord Acton, Henry Matthews MP, Lord Edmund Talbot, and Sir Donald Macfarlane.&quot;

The cathedral opened in 1903, a year after Bentley&#x27;s death. One of the first public liturgies to be celebrated in the cathedral was Cardinal Vaughan&#x27;s Requiem Mass; the Cardinal died on 19 June 1903. When the debt on the building fund was liquidated, consecration ceremony took place on 28 June 1910 Under the laws of the Catholic Church, no place of worship could be consecrated unless free from debt. 

The decoration of the interior had hardly been started at the time of consecration, as the decoration in Byzantine churches is applied, rather than integral to the architecture. Therefore finishing the decoration of the cathedral was left to the subsequent generations. It is an architectural gem with its interior notable for rich marble decorations and the beautiful, but still incomplete, mosaics.

In 1895, the cathedral was dedicated to the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ. This is commemorated by the Latin dedication above the portal tympanum:

The Feast of the Dedication of the Cathedral is celebrated each year on 1 July, which from 1849 until the Second Vatican Council (1969) was the feast of the Most Precious Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

The additional co—patrons are the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, Saint Peter, Saint Augustine of Canterbury, Saint Patrick, along with all remaining Catholic saints of Britain and Ireland.

In 1977, as part of her Silver Jubilee Celebrations, Queen Elizabeth II visited the cathedral to view a flower show.

On 28 May 1982, the first day of his six-day pastoral visit to the United Kingdom, Pope John Paul II celebrated Holy Mass in the cathedral.

On Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day, 30 November 1995, at the invitation of Basil Cardinal Hume, Queen Elizabeth again visited the cathedral but this time she attended Choral Vespers, the first participation of the Queen in a Roman Catholic church liturgy in Great Britain.

On 18 September 2010, on the third day of his four-day state visit to the United Kingdom, Pope Benedict XVI celebrated Mass in the cathedral.

In January 2011 the cathedral was the venue for the reception and later ordination of three former Anglican bishops into the newly formed Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham.

In 2012, the cathedral was the host of two episodes of the BBC Four three-part documentary series named &quot;Catholics&quot;: the first episode looked at women who attend and/or work at the cathedral and their faith, and the third episode looked at the men training to become priests at Allen Hall seminary, and in the episode was a brief scene of their ordination at the cathedral.

In May 2021, during the Covid Pandemic and the banning of public mass, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds were wed at the Cathedral.

==Architecture==
Westminster Cathedral is the 50th largest church in the world in terms of interior area (5,017m²), seating up to 2,000 people. It is the 38th largest Catholic church globally in terms of interior area.

The whole building, in the neo-Byzantine style, covers a floor area of about ; the dominating factor of the scheme, apart from the campanile, being a spacious and uninterrupted nave, wide and long from the narthex to the sanctuary steps, covered with domical vaulting.

In planning the nave, a system of supports was adopted not unlike that to be seen in most Gothic cathedrals, where huge, yet narrow, buttresses are projected at intervals, and stiffened by transverse walls, arcading and vaulting. Unlike in a Gothic cathedral, at Westminster they are limited to the interior. The main piers and transverse arches that support the domes divide the nave into three bays, each about . The domes rest on the arches at a height of from the floor, the total internal height being .

In selecting the pendentive type of dome, of shallow concavity, for the main roofing, weight and pressure have been reduced to a minimum. The domes and pendentures are formed of concrete, and as extraneous roofs of timber were dispensed with, it was necessary to provide a thin independent outer shell of impervious stone. The concrete flat roofing around the domes is covered with asphalt. The sanctuary is essentially Byzantine in its system of construction. The extensions that open out on all sides make the corona of the dome seem independent of support.

The eastern termination of the cathedral suggests the Romanesque, or Lombardic style of Northern Italy. The crypt with openings into the sanctuary, thus closely following the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, Milan, the open colonnade under the eaves, the timber roof following the curve of the apex, are all familiar features. The large buttresses resist the pressure of a vault in span. Although the cruciform plan is not very noticeable inside the building, it is emphasised outside by the boldly projecting transepts. These with their twin gables, slated roofs, and square turrets with pyramidal stone cappings suggest a Norman prototype in striking contrast to the rest of the design.

The main structural parts of the building are of brick and concrete, the latter material being used for the vaulting and domes of graduated thickness and complicated curve. Following Byzantine tradition, the interior was designed with a view to the application of marble and mosaic. Throughout the exterior, the lavish introduction of white stone bands in connection with the red brickwork (itself quite common in the immediate area) produces an impression quite foreign to the British eye. The bricks were hand-moulded and delivered by Faversham Brickfields at Faversham in Kent and Thomas Lawrence Brickworks in Bracknell. The main entrance façade owes its composition, in a measure, to accident rather than design. The most prominent feature of the façade is the deeply recessed arch over the central entrance, flanked by tribunes, and stairway turrets. The elevation on the north, with a length of nearly contrasted with the vertical lines of the campanile and the transepts, is most impressive. It rests on a continuous and plain basement of granite, and only above the flat roofing of the chapels does the structure assume a varied outline.

Marble columns, with capitals of Byzantine type, support the galleries and other subsidiary parts of the building. The marble selected for the columns was, in some instances, obtained from formations quarried by the ancient Romans, chiefly in Greece.

===High altar===
The central feature of the decoration in the cathedral is the baldacchino over the high altar. This is one of the largest structures of its kind, the total width being , and the height . The upper part of white marble is richly inlaid with coloured marbles, lapis lazuli, pearl, and gold. Eight columns of yellow marble, from Verona, support the baldacchino over the high altar, and others, white and pink, from Norway, support the organ galleries.

Behind the baldacchino the crypt emerges above the floor of the sanctuary, and the podium thus formed is broken in the middle by the steps that lead up to the retro-choir. The curved wall of the crypt is lined with narrow slabs of green carystran marble. Opening out of this crypt is a smaller chamber, directly under the high altar. Here are laid the remains of the first two Archbishops of Westminster, Cardinal Wiseman and Cardinal Manning. The altar and relics of Saint Edmund of Canterbury occupy a recess on the south side of the chamber. The little chapel of Saint Thomas of Canterbury, entered from the north transept, is used as a chantry for Cardinal Vaughan. A large Byzantine style crucifix, suspended from the sanctuary arch, dominates the nave.

===Chapels===
The chapel of the Blessed Sacrament, on the north side of the sanctuary, and the Lady Chapel on the south, are entered from the transepts; they are 6.7 m (22 ft) wide, lofty, with open arcades, barrel vaulting, and apsidal ends. Over the altar of the Blessed Sacrament chapel a small baldacchino is suspended from the vault, and the chapel is enclosed with bronze grilles and gates through which people may enter. In the Lady Chapel the walls are clad in marble and the altar reredos is a mosaic of the Virgin and Child, surrounded by a white marble frame. The conches of the chapel contain predominantly blue mosaics of the Old Testament prophets Daniel, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Unlike the Blessed Sacrament chapel, the chapel dedicated to the Blessed Mother is completely open. The building of the Lady Chapel was funded by Baroness Weld in memory of her second husband.

Those chapels which may be entered from the aisles of the nave are also wide, and roofed with simple barrel vaulting. The chapel of Saints Gregory and Augustine, next to the baptistery, from which it is separated by an open screen of marble, was the first to have its decoration completed. The marble lining of the piers rises to the springing level of the vaulting and this level has determined the height of the altar reredos, and of the screen opposite. On the side wall, under the windows, the marble dado rises to but little more than half this height. From the cornices the mosaic decoration begins on the walls and vault. This general arrangement applies to all the chapels yet each has its own distinct artistic character. Thus, in sharp contrast to the chapel dedicated to St. Gregory and St. Augustine which contains vibrant mosaics, the chapel of the Holy Souls employs a more subdued, almost funereal style, decoration with late Victorian on a background of silver.

As in many Catholic churches, there are the Stations of the Cross to be found along the outer aisles. The ones at Westminster Cathedral are by the sculptor Eric Gill, and are considered to be amongst the finest examples of his work.

==Mosaics==
When the cathedral&#x27;s architect John Bentley died, there were no completed mosaics in the cathedral and Bentley left behind precious little in terms of sketches and designs. Consequently, the subject and styles of the mosaics were influenced by donors as well as designers, overseen by a cathedral committee established for this purpose. Indeed, Bentley&#x27;s influence is, in reality, only seen in the chapel dedicated to the Holy Souls. Due to the prevailing absence of any real designs by Bentley, there was no real agreement as to how the mosaics should look, and in one instance, works already installed (in the Sacred Heart shrine) were removed after the death of the artist, George Bridge.

Mosaics installed during the period 1912–1916 were mostly done by devotees of the Arts and Crafts Movement. Those in the Lady Chapel were installed by the experienced mosaicist Gertrude Martin (who had worked with George Bridge), in 1912–1913. The work was supervised by Anning Bell and Marshall, who later designed the mosaic of Christ enthroned which is above the entrance to the cathedral. The Tympanum of the portal shows in a Byzantine mosaic technique from left to right the kneeling St Peter with the Keys of Heaven, the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ as Pantocrator on the throne, St Joseph, the Nursing Father of Jesus with a lily in his right hand, and in a kneeling position the canonized English King Edward the Confessor in royal regalia. As Jesus Christ blesses the viewer with his right hand, he holds in his left hand the Book of Life. The Latin inscription of the opened book pages reads: &quot;Ego sum ostium per me si quis introierit salvabitur&quot; (I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved; Gospel of John 10,9).

The mosaics in the chapel dedicated to Saint Andrew, paid for by The 4th Marquess of Bute, also belong to work of the Arts and Craft Movement.

The five-year period 1930 to 1935 saw a tremendous amount of work done, with mosaics placed in the Lady Chapel, in the alcoves above the confessionals, in the crypt dedicated to Saint Peter, and on the sanctuary arch.

No new mosaics were installed until 1950 when one depicting St Thérèse of Lisieux (later replaced by a bronze) was placed in the south transept and another, in 1952, in memory of those in the Royal Army Medical Corps who died in World War II, in the chapel of Saint George. From 1960 to 1962, the Blessed Sacrament Chapel was decorated in a traditional, early Christian style, with the mosaics being predominantly pale pink in order to afford a sense of light and space. The designer, Boris Anrep, chose various Eucharistic themes such as the sacrifice of Abel, the hospitality of Abraham and the gathering of the manna in the wilderness, as well as the Feeding the multitude and the Wedding Feast at Cana. In his old age, Anrep also acted as adviser and principal sketch artist for the mosaics installed in the chapel of Saint Paul (1964–1965). These mosaics depict various moments in the life of Paul; his occupation as a tent-maker, his conversion to Christ, the shipwreck on Malta and his eventual execution in Rome.

It was not until the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1982 that the next mosaic was installed above the north-west entrance. Rather than a scene, this mosaic is an inscription: &quot;Porta sis ostium pacificum per eum qui se ostium appellavit, Jesus Christum&quot; (May this door be the gate of peace through Him who called Himself the gate, Jesus Christ). In 1999, the mosaic of Saint Patrick, holding a shamrock and a pastoral staff as well as trampling on a snake, was installed at the entrance to the chapel in his honour. In 2001, a striking mosaic of Saint Alban, strongly influenced by the style of early Byzantine iconography, was installed by the designer, Christopher Hobbs. Due to the very favourable reception of the work, Hobbs was commissioned for further mosaics: the chapel to Saint Joseph which contains mosaics of the Holy Family (2003) and men working on Westminster Cathedral (2006). Hobbs also did the chapel in honour of Saint Thomas Becket illustrating the saint standing in front of the old Canterbury Cathedral on the chapel&#x27;s east wall and the murder of Thomas on the west wall. The vault is decorated with a design of flowers, tendrils and roundels (2006). , there were plans for further mosaics, including depictions of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Anthony in the narthex.

==Music==
Despite its relatively short history compared to other English cathedrals, Westminster has a distinguished choral tradition. It has its origin in the shared vision of Cardinal Vaughan, the cathedral&#x27;s founder, and Sir Richard Runciman Terry, its inaugural Master of Music. Terry prepared his choristers for a year before their first sung service in public. For the remainder of his tenure (until 1924) he pursued a celebrated revival of great quantities of Latin repertoire from the English Renaissance, most of which had lain unsung ever since the Reformation. Students at the Royal College of Music who would become household names were introduced to their heritage when Charles Villiers Stanford sent them to the cathedral to hear &quot;polyphony for a penny&quot; (the bus fare). This programme also required honing the boys&#x27; sight-reading ability to a then-unprecedented standard.

The choir has commissioned many works from distinguished composers, many of whom are better known for their contribution to Anglican music, such as Benjamin Britten and Ralph Vaughan Williams. However, the choir is particularly renowned for its performance of Gregorian chant and polyphony of the Renaissance.

Unlike most other English cathedrals, Westminster does not have a separate quire; instead, the choir are hidden from view in the apse behind the high altar. This, with the excellent acoustic of the cathedral building, contributes to its distinctive sound.

Located in the west gallery, the Grand Organ of four manuals and 81 stops occupies a more commanding position than many British cathedral organs enjoy. Built by Henry Willis III from 1922 to 1932, it remains one of the most successful and admired. One of Louis Vierne&#x27;s best-known organ pieces, &quot;Carillon de Westminster&quot;, the final movement from Suite no. 3 (op. 54) of Pièces de Fantaisie, was originally improvised on it in 1924, and the subsequent 1927 published version is dedicated to Willis.

The apse organ of fifteen stops was built in 1910 by Lewis &amp; Co. Although the Grand Organ has its own attached console, a console in the apse can play both instruments.

On 3 May 1902, some 3,000 people attended a concert of sacred music in the cathedral, organised to raise money for the Choir School and to test the acoustics in the building. The music was provided by an orchestra of a hundred and a choir of two hundred, including the Cathedral Choir, directed by Richard Terry. The programme included music by Wagner, Purcell, Beethoven, Palestrina, Byrd and Tallis. The acoustics proved to be excellent. One year later, on 6 June 1903, the first performance in London of &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;, a poem by Cardinal John Henry Newman, set to music by Edward Elgar, took place in the cathedral. The composer himself conducted, with Richard Terry at the organ. Once again, the proceeds went to support the Cathedral Choir School.

John Tavener&#x27;s &quot;The Beautiful Names&quot;, a setting of the 99 names of Allah found in the Qur&#x27;an, premièred in the cathedral on 19 June 2007, in a performance by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in the presence of Charles, Prince of Wales.

==Choir==
The founder of Westminster Cathedral, Cardinal Herbert Vaughan laid great emphasis on the beauty and integrity of the cathedral&#x27;s liturgy. Initially, he determined there should be a community of Benedictine monks at the new cathedral, performing the liturgies and singing the daily Office. This caused great resentment amongst the secular clergy of the diocese, who felt they were being snubbed. In the end, negotiations with both the English Benedictines and the community of French Benedictines at Farnborough failed and a traditional choir of men and boys was set up instead. Despite great financial problems, the Choir School opened on 5 October 1901 with eleven boy choristers, in the building originally intended for the monks. Cardinal Vaughan received the boys with the words &quot;You are the foundation stones&quot;. The Cathedral Choir was officially instituted three months later in January 1902. Sung Masses and Offices were immediately established when the cathedral opened for worship in 1903, and have continued without interruption ever since.

In September 2020, Cardinal Vincent Nichols responded to a strategic review of sacred music at Westminster Cathedral, asking that &quot;all those who profess to be fervent supporters of this precious inheritance of sacred music to become regular contributors to its financial support. It is, unquestionably, time to look ahead in order to ensure that this tradition of sacred music in Westminster Cathedral...can be put onto a firm footing for years to come.&quot;

When the question of a musical director was first considered, the choice fell on the singer Sir Charles Santley, who had conducted the choir of the pro-cathedral in Kensington on several occasions. But Santley knew his limitations and refused. Richard Runciman Terry—Director of Music at Downside Abbey School—then became the first director of music of Westminster Cathedral. It proved to be an inspired choice. Terry was both a brilliant choir trainer and a pioneering scholar, one of the first musicologists to revive the great works of the English and other European Renaissance composers. Terry built Westminster Cathedral Choir&#x27;s reputation on performances of music—by Byrd, Tallis, Taverner, Palestrina and Victoria, among others—that had not been heard since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and Mass at the cathedral was soon attended by inquisitive musicians as well as the faithful. The performance of great Renaissance Masses and motets in their proper liturgical context remains the cornerstone of the choir&#x27;s activity.

Terry resigned in 1924, and was succeeded by Canon Lancelot Long who had been one of the original eleven choristers in 1901.

At the beginning of the Second World War, the boys were at first evacuated to Uckfield in East Sussex, but eventually the choir school was closed altogether for the remainder of the war. The music at the cathedral was performed by a reduced body of professional men singers. During this period, from 1941 to 1947, the Master of Music was William Hyde, who had been the sub-organist under Richard Terry.

Hyde was succeeded by George Malcolm, who developed the continental sound of the choir and consolidated its musical reputation—in particular through the now legendary recording of Victoria&#x27;s &quot;Tenebrae responsories&quot;. More recent holders of the post have included Francis Cameron, Colin Mawby, Stephen Cleobury, David Hill, James O&#x27;Donnell and Martin Baker. In May 2021, Simon Johnson was appointed as the Master of Music.

In addition to its performances of Renaissance masterpieces, Westminster Cathedral Choir has given many first performances of music written especially for it by contemporary composers. Terry gave the premières of music by Vaughan Williams (whose Mass in G minor received its liturgical performance at a Mass in the cathedral), Gustav Holst, Herbert Howells and Charles Wood; in 1959 Benjamin Britten wrote his Missa brevis for the choristers; and since 1960 works by Lennox Berkeley, William Mathias, Colin Mawby and Francis Grier have been added to the repertoire. Most recently four new Masses—by Roxanna Panufnik, James MacMillan, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies and Judith Bingham—have received their first performance in the cathedral. In June 2005 the choristers performed the world première of Sir John Tavener&#x27;s Missa Brevis for boys&#x27; voices.

Westminster Cathedral Choir made its first recording in 1907. Many more have followed in the Westminster Cathedral Choir discography, most recently the series on the Hyperion label, and many awards have been conferred on the choir&#x27;s recordings. Of these the most prestigious are the 1998 Gramophone Awards for both Best Choral Recording of the Year and Record of the Year, for the performance of Martin&#x27;s Mass for Double Choir and Pizzetti&#x27;s Requiem, conducted by O&#x27;Donnell. It is the only cathedral choir to have won in either of these categories.

When its duties at the cathedral permit, the choir also gives concert performances both at home and abroad. It has appeared at many important festivals, including Aldeburgh, Cheltenham, Salzburg, Copenhagen, Bremen and Spitalfields. It has appeared in many of the major concert halls of Britain, including the Royal Festival Hall, the Wigmore Hall and the Royal Albert Hall. The cathedral choir also broadcasts frequently on radio and television.

Westminster Cathedral Choir has undertaken a number of international tours, including visits to Hungary, Germany and the US. The choristers participated in the 2003 and 2006 International Gregorian chant Festival in Watou, Belgium, and the full choir performed twice at the Oslo International Church Music Festival in March 2006. In April 2005, 2007 and 2008 they performed as part of the &quot;Due Organi in Concerto&quot; festival in Milan. In October 2011, they sang the inaugural concert of the Institute for Sacred Music at Saint John&#x27;s in Minnesota.

The cathedral is frequently referred to as the &#x27;Drome&#x27;. This dates from the early 20th century days when the Lay Clerks were represented by Equity—the trade union for actors and variety artists. In the profession, it was jokingly referred to as &#x27;The Westminster Hippodrome&#x27;—a nickname which was later shortened to the &#x27;Drome&#x27;.

==&quot;Oremus&quot; magazine==

Westminster Cathedral has published a monthly magazine since 1896, before the building work was completed. The latest in a series of titles is &quot;Oremus&quot;, which first appeared in 1996. (The Latin word &quot;oremus&quot; translates into English as &quot;Let us pray&quot;.) &quot;Oremus&quot; is a 32-page colour magazine, which contains features and articles by well-known members of the Catholic community, as well as non-Catholic commentators and leading figures within British society. It is the successor of titles such as the &quot;Westminster Cathedral Record&quot;, selling at 6d per copy from January 1896, the &quot;Westminster Cathedral Chronicle&quot;, a monthly, available from January 1907 at 2d a copy or 3/- a year, post paid, and the &quot;Westminster Cathedral Bulletin&quot;, first published in 1974. Dylan Parry, who edited the magazine between 2012 and August 2016, took the decision to make &quot;Oremus&quot; a free publication in 2013. The magazine is also available to download via Westminster Cathedral&#x27;s website.

<text>The western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana), is a medium-sized American songbird. Formerly placed in the tanager family (Thraupidae), it and other members of its genus are classified in the cardinal family (Cardinalidae). The species&#x27;s plumage and vocalizations are similar to other members of the cardinal family.

==Taxonomy==
The western tanager was illustrated and formally described by American ornithologist Alexander Wilson in 1811 under the binomial name &quot;Tanagra ludoviciana&quot; from a specimen collected on the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804–1806). The type locality is Kamiah, Idaho. The specific epithet is from the Late Latin &quot;ludovicianus&quot; for &quot;Louis&quot;. The name is from Louisiana, the 18th-century French administrative district of New France, rather than the modern state. The western tanager is now placed in the genus &quot;Piranga&quot; that was introduced by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1808. The species is monotypic; no subspecies are recognized.

== Description ==
Measurements:

* Length: 6.3–7.5 in (16–19 cm)
* Weight: 0.8–1.3 oz (24–36 g)
* Wingspan: 11.5 in (29 cm)

Adults have pale, stout pointed bills, yellow underparts, and light wing bars. Adult males have a bright red face and a yellow nape, shoulder, and rump, with black upper back, wings, and tail; in non-breeding plumage, the head has no more than a reddish cast and the body has an olive tinge. Females have a yellow head and are olive on the back, with dark wings and tail.

The song of disconnected short phrases suggests an American robin&#x27;s, but is hoarser and rather monotonous. The call is described as &quot;pit-er-ick&quot;.

Their breeding habitat is coniferous or mixed woods across western North America from the Mexico-U.S. border as far north as southern Alaska; thus, they are the northernmost-breeding tanager. They build a flimsy cup nest on a horizontal tree branch, usually in a conifer. They lay four bluish-green eggs with brown spots.

These birds migrate, wintering from central Mexico to Costa Rica. Some also winter in Southern California.

==Distribution and habitat==
The breeding range of the western tanager includes forests along the western coast of North America from southeastern Alaska south to northern Baja California, Mexico. Western tanagers extend east to western Texas and north through central New Mexico, central Colorado, extreme northwest Nebraska, and areas of western South Dakota to southern Northwest Territories, Canada. The western tanager&#x27;s wintering range stretches from central Costa Rica north through Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala to southern Baja California Sur and extreme southeastern Sonora in western Mexico and to southern Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico. Western tanagers do not typically occur in the Caribbean lowlands. They have been reported wintering further north and have been observed as far south as Panama. Vagrants are rare to casual in the eastern United States.

In addition to the plant communities listed above, western tanagers are reported from disturbed habitats. For instance, western tanagers were seen in an area of northwestern California that had been logged less than five years previously. Cutleaf burnweed (&quot;Erechtites glomerata&quot;) was characteristic of the youngest age class, while slightly older sites were composed predominantly of tanoak (&quot;Lithocarpus densiflorus&quot;) with smaller amounts of snowbrush ceanothus (&quot;Ceanothus velutinus&quot;), whitebark raspberry (&quot;Rubus leucodermis&quot;), and Sierra gooseberry (&quot;Ribes roezlii&quot;). In addition, western tanagers were captured along the Rio Grande in New Mexico during spring and fall migration in an agricultural area composed primarily of alfalfa (&quot;Medicago sativa&quot;) and corn (&quot;Zea mays&quot;).

Western tanagers have also been observed in saltcedar (&quot;Tamarix&quot; species) communities and in Russian olive (&quot;Elaeagnus angustifolia&quot;) vegetation. In New Mexico, western tanagers were observed in nearly pure stands of saltcedar 10 to 23 ft (3–7 m) tall. Western tanagers were also observed in saltcedar communities during fall migration in along the Rio Grande. Ten western tanagers were observed among three sites composed of Russian olive in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho. All sites were dominated by Russian olive with cheatgrass (&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;) comprising a substantial portion of the understory. Along the Rio Grande, western tanagers were most often captured during fall migration in vegetation with a Rio Grande cottonwood (&quot;Populus deltoides species wislizenii&quot;) overstory and a moderate to dense Russian olive understory.

==Behavior and ecology==
Western tanagers migrate alone or in groups of up to 30 birds. On average, hatching-year western tanagers were captured later (early September) at Rio Grande Nature Center than adult western tanagers (mid-August) during fall migration. Migration timing, condition of birds, and site differences in spring and fall migration were also addressed in this investigation.

===Breeding===
Western tanagers arrive on their breeding grounds in spring. Breeding usually occurs among birds two years or older, beginning in May and continuing into July, although some first-year western tanagers also breed. In the Sandia Mountains of north-central New Mexico, western tanagers were heard singing beginning in late May, and the first nest was found in early June. In public open-space areas in Boulder County, Colorado, the start of the western tanager breeding season was estimated as 28 May, and the peak of the breeding season, defined as at least 50% of western tanager nests active, was from 6 June to 1 July. In the Southwest, brooding generally begins in early May, while in the Northwest, brooding starts typically in mid-June. Brooding can begin earlier in British Columbia and Alberta than in the northwestern United States. An egg-laying date as early as 16 May in British Columbia was estimated by back calculation, and a complete egg set was observed as early as 26 May in Alberta.

Cup nests are built by the female, take about four or more days to construct, and are made from twigs, rootlets, grasses, and pine needles. No evidence has been found for second broods in western tanagers, but a review notes a nesting attempt after a failed nest in west-central Idaho, and suggests that renesting is a substantial source of late nesting attempts. In addition, renesting was suggested as the explanation for a few late nests observed in Boulder County, Colorado.

Clutch size is typically three to five eggs. Average clutch size in 10 nonparasitized nests in Boulder County was 3.8 eggs. Average clutch in the Southwest may be smaller than that of western tanagers nesting in the north. Egglaying generally takes about one day per egg. The female incubates the eggs for about 13 days, although shorter incubation periods have been reported. The young are fed by both parents, and typically fledge 11 to 15 days after hatching. Immature western tanagers have been observed with the parents at least two weeks after fledging.

Immature western tanagers initiate migration later than adult birds. Generally, western tanagers leave more northerly locations in late summer or early fall, while those in more southerly areas may stay as late as early November.

Reproductive success of western tanagers varies widely between studies and across years. An average annual nest success probability estimate is 0.186 over 3 years, with a low of 0.035 and a high of 0.349. In a northern Arizona study area, an average of 43% (n=7) of nests succeeded to the nestling stage. In Boulder County, nesting success varied from 11.3% to 75.3%, with an average of 51.8% over a 3-year period. Daily nest survival rate on ungrazed sites in northeastern New Mexico was 0.955, which was not significantly (p&lt;0.05) different from the 0.973 daily nest survival rate found on grazed sites. Nest predation is the leading cause of nest failure. Predation rates ranged from 30% (n=48) in a study in New Mexico pinyon-juniper woodland to 86% (n=14) in a mixed-conifer forest in Idaho.

Western tanagers can live several years. The annual average survival rate is 0.753 and a return rate is 30.1% for western tanagers in west-central Idaho. A wild western tanager 7 years and 11 months old has been documented from banding data.

====Habitat====
During the breeding season, western tanagers are found primarily in relatively open coniferous forests and mixed woodlands. During migration, western tanagers occur in more areas, including lowland woodlands of Southern California, desert oases, riparian areas, parks, and orchards. In the western tanager&#x27;s wintering range, it occupies pine (&quot;Pinus&quot; spp.) and pine-oak (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.) woodlands, as well as low-canopied scrub forests, forest edges, and coffee plantations.

Western tanagers breed at a wide range of elevations from about 183 ft (56 m) in the Northwest up to 10,000 ft (3,050 m). In the northern portion of their breeding range, western tanagers have been observed on sites over 8,300 ft (2,530 m) in Oregon down to sites as low as 183 ft (56 m) in Oregon&#x27;s Central Willamette Valley. In the southern portion of their breeding range, western tanagers are more typical on high-elevation sites. They were observed on an Arizona site 8,270 ft (2,520 m) in elevation and on a site at 9,500 ft (2,900 m) in Nevada.

====Nesting====
Western tanagers nest in second-growth and mature conifer and mixed forests. They only breed in stands of pole- to large-sized trees and stands of pole- to medium-sized trees with &gt;70% canopy cover. Nesting was confined to older second-growth (&gt;40 years) and mature (120+ years) Douglas fir (&quot;Pseudotsuga menziesii&quot;) communities in the western Cascade Range in Oregon.

Western tanager nests are typically found in coniferous trees toward the end of horizontal branches and at heights greater than 10 ft (3 m); 79% of 43 western tanager nests in British Columbia were found in conifers, primarily Douglas fir. The deciduous trees most often used were quaking aspen (&quot;Populus tremuloides&quot;) and willows (&quot;Salix&quot; spp.). The position of their nests along the branches of deciduous trees was more variable than in conifers. On this site, 56% of nests were at heights from 21 to 36 ft (6.4–11 m). Of 9 western tanager nests in an Alberta study site, eight occurred in white spruce (&quot;Picea glauca&quot;) and one was found in quaking aspen. Nest height ranged from 20 to 42 ft (6.3–12.8 m), with a mean of about 30 ft (9.3 m). On average, nests were located 80% of the distance from the trunk to the tip of the branch. Of 49 western tanager nests found in a pinyon-juniper (&quot;Pinus-Juniperus&quot; spp.) woodland in northeastern New Mexico, 98% were in Colorado pinyon (&quot;P. edulis&quot;) and the remainder occurred in Douglas fir. On this site, nest trees averaged 24 ft (7.4 m) in height and over 8 in (21.9 cm) in diameter at breast height (dbh). The average height of nests was 18 ft (5.4 m). In a nearby mixed-conifer forest, nests were found in Douglas fir and ponderosa pine (&quot;P. ponderosa&quot;). Nest trees on this site averaged nearly 50 ft (15.1 m) in height and 13 in (32.7 cm) in dbh. The average nest height was 16 ft (4.93 m) and on average nests were located about 5 ft (1.49 m) from the tree stem and 3 ft (0.97 m) from the edge of the tree&#x27;s foliage. Western tanager nests on a north-central New Mexico site occurred at heights from 8 to 15 ft (2–5 m), typically in white fir (&quot;Abies concolor&quot;) located in open areas. In Idaho, nests were found in conifers at an average height of 40 ft (12.3 m) and ranged from 8 to 55 ft (2.4–16.8 m). Of 58 nests at a Colorado study site, 54 occurred in ponderosa pine and four were found in Douglas fir. Nest height was significantly associated with tree height, with the mean nest height around 54% of tree height. On average, western tanager nests were located 63% of the distance between the trunk and the branch tip. This is closer to the bole than found in most studies, and the authors suggest that the conical shape of the ponderosa pine requires nests be placed closer in toward the trunk to provide cover. Canopy cover at nest sites averaged 71%, with a minimum of 31% cover.

====Foraging habitat====

Western tanagers forage in many habitats, in all successional stages from grass-forb communities to stands of large trees with greater than 70% cover. In western Oregon, they were not observed using the grass and forb successional stages, but were observed foraging in areas not used for nesting, such as shrub/sapling and young second-growth (16–40 years old) stands typically made up of Douglas fir.

Although western tanagers forage in many habitats, they are typically observed foraging in forest canopies. For instance, in an area of California primarily dominated by giant sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;), western tanagers spent 60% to 75% of their foraging time above 35 ft (10 m) and less than 2% of foraging time below 12 ft (4 m). In coniferous forests of western Montana, they were typically observed foraging in canopy foliage above 26 ft (8 m). In mixed conifer-oak forests in California, they foraged from 16 to 92 ft (5–28 m).

In primarily Douglas fir-dominated vegetation in British Columbia, the occurrence of western tanager foraging in various portions of trees and the size of those trees were investigated. This species perched on stems less than 1 in (&lt;2.5 cm) in diameter in 96.9% of observations. Nearly 85% of observations were either near the branch tip or in the middle of the branch. Western tanagers foraged on larger trees, with nearly 80% of observations on trees with a trunk diameter of more than about 8 in (20.0 cm), and over 80% of observations occurring on trees 33 ft (10 m) or taller. They used taller trees and trees with larger diameters significantly more than their availability in all silvicultural treatments analyzed.

Western tanagers may preferentially forage on certain species. In a California study of foraging and habitat relationships of insect-gleaning birds in mixed conifer-oak forest, they used white fir more and incense-cedar (&quot;Calocedrus decurrens&quot;) less than would be expected from their availability. Sugar pine (&quot;Pinus lambertiana&quot;), Douglas fir, and California black oak (&quot;Quercus kelloggii&quot;) were used slightly more than their availability, but this was not considered significant, since 95% confidence intervals overlapped with use in accordance with availability. Ponderosa pine was used in proportion to its availability. In mostly Douglas fir-dominated communities in British Columbia, western tanagers were observed foraging in Douglas fir in 88.9% of observations, ponderosa pine in 7.4% of observations, and in living trees of other species in 3.7% of observations. Over all sites, the preference for Douglas-fir was significantly (p&lt;0.001) greater than availability. When sites were separated by the various silvicultural treatments, only the 3-year-old light cut (Douglas fir and ponderosa pine larger than 14 in (35 cm) in dbh and other species larger than 6 in (15 cm) dbh were harvested) and the selectively logged (20% of 6- to 8-in dbh (15.2–20.3 cm) trees, 25% of 8- to 12-in dbh (20.3–30.5 cm) trees, 45% of 12- to 24-inch dbh (30.5–61.0 cm) trees, and 75% of &gt;24-inch dbh (&gt;61.0 cm) trees were removed) sites showed significantly greater use of Douglas fir by western tanagers than would be expected from availability. They were reported foraging on quaking aspen, as well as balsam poplar (&quot;P. balsamifera&quot; ssp. &quot;balsamifera&quot;), speckled alder (&quot;Alnus rugosa&quot;), and white spruce in central Alberta.

Although western tanagers occur in stands of varying ages and have been observed in higher densities on young sites, they are typically detected more often in relatively mature stands. For example, they appear to occur more often in mature (50–60 years old) and old-growth (100+ years) quaking aspen than young (&lt;23 years old) trembling aspen stands in the Prince Rupert Forest Region of British Columbia. In Alberta, western tanager was detected significantly (p&lt;0.001) more often in old (120+ years old) quaking aspen mixed-wood stands than in mature (50–65 years old) or young (20–30 years old) mixed-wood stands. The same trend has been found in other communities. In Washington, western tanager was observed on sites dominated by older (35-year- and 60-year-old) red alder (&quot;A. rubra&quot;), but not on sites containing young (4-year- and 10-year-old sites) red alder. Although western tanagers were fairly common on recently harvested sites, they were detected at the most points in &quot;mature&quot; and &quot;old-growth&quot; ponderosa pine in northern Idaho and western Montana. Western tanagers had higher densities in mature (33 ft, &gt;10 m tall) conifer plots and young conifer/mature conifer transition plots than in young (3–33 ft, 1–10 m tall) conifer plots in British Columbia. Western tanagers occurred at an average density of 53.2 birds/100 ha in sawtimber Douglas fir stands (&gt;80–150 years old), 37.0/100 ha in mature Douglas fir stands (&gt;100 years old), and 3.1/100 ha in sapling Douglas fir stands (&lt;20 years old) in northern California. Although they occurred at higher densities in young Douglas fir forest in Oregon, the stands were 40 to 72 years old. Mature forest was from 80 to 120 years old, and old-growth forest was 200 to 525 years old.

====Stand structure and composition====

Western tanagers appear to prefer large trees, which are considered an important component of stands for them. In addition, western tanagers were significantly positively associated with large saw timber (&gt;20% cover, &gt;21 in [&gt;53.2 cm] mean dbh) and significantly negatively associated with pole timber (&gt;20% cover; conifers &gt;10 ft [&gt;3 m] tall and 4–12 inh (10.2–30.4 cm) mean dbh; hardwoods 10–50 ft (3–15 m) tall and 4–12 in mean dbh) stands dominated by Douglas fir, western hemlock (&quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot;), and red alder in the central Oregon Coast Ranges. In primarily Douglas fir-dominated communities in British Columbia, western tanagers foraged in trees &gt;33 ft (&gt;10 m) tall in more than 80% of observations, and nearly 80% of foraging observations were in trees with trunk diameters greater than 8 in (&gt;20.0 cm). In addition, western tanagers foraged in trees smaller than 33 ft (10 m) tall less than their availability.

Most evidence suggests that western tanagers prefer areas with moderate canopy cover. They avoid continuous canopy. Stands with large trees and 40 to 69% canopy cover are an optimal western tanager habitat. Large trees and canopy cover ≥70% is considered suitable habitat, while areas with large trees and &lt;40% cover are categorized as marginal habitat. In sapling/pole and mature ponderosa pine habitats of the Black Hills in South Dakota, western tanagers occurred at the highest densities in stands with intermediate (40%-70%) canopy cover. In 35- to 45-year-old Douglas fir and red alder-dominated stands, an average of 322% more western tanagers were detected on sites logged to a density of 240 to 320 trees/ha, and an average of 363% more of them were detected on sites logged to a density of 180 to 220 trees/ha, compared to controls with 410 to 710 trees/ha. The difference in western tanager detections between the logging treatments and the control grew larger over time. In Arizona, western tanagers occurred at significantly higher densities (15.8/40 ha) in forest dominated by Douglas fir and ponderosa pine the year after logging to an average of 167.7 trees/ha compared to control stands (7.7/40 ha) with average tree density of 626.2 trees/ha. Western tanager densities on the treatment and control sites were more similar the following year. In British Columbia, western tanagers occurred at significantly higher densities after &quot;light&quot; logging on a site containing Douglas fir and ponderosa pine. The species apparently was positively influenced by thinning a ponderosa pine stand by 20% in Arizona. In the Sierra Nevada of California, western tanagers occurred at a higher density in an open-canopied (602 trees &gt;10 cm dbh/ha) mixed-conifer stand consisting of Jeffrey pine (&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot;), lodgepole pine (&quot;P. contorta&quot;), white fir, and incense-cedar compared to a closed-canopied (994 trees &gt;10 cm dbh/ha) mixed conifer stand of incense-cedar and white fir. This same pattern was found in open- (420 trees &gt; 10 cm dbh/ha) and closed-canopied (658 trees &gt; 10 cm dbh) California red fir (&quot;Abies magnifica&quot; var.&quot; magnifica&quot;) stands.

Western tanagers have been reported to prefer areas with a diverse forest structure, but importance of lower forest layers is unclear. In the Black Hills of South Dakota, they were significantly more abundant in multistoried habitats with bur oak (&quot;Q. macrocarpa&quot;) and quaking aspen/paper birch (&quot;Betula papyrifera&quot;) under a ponderosa pine canopy than in sapling/pole or mature ponderosa pine stands with varying canopy cover. Reviews assert the importance of a diverse forest structure and a dense deciduous understory for western tanagers. In some areas, though, the influence of lower forest layers may be relatively insignificant. For example, removal of incense-cedar and white fir from 1 to 10 ft (0.3–3 m) tall in giant sequoia forests had little impact on western tanager density.

Western tanagers may associate with or avoid some plant species. For example, in mixed-wood forests in Alberta, western they were significantly positively associated with conifer density. The western tanager was also considered a conifer-associated species in quaking aspen-dominated and mixed quaking aspen-conifer communities in British Columbia. Western tanagers&#x27; preference for multistoried habitats in the Black Hills may be related to the bur oak and quaking aspen/paper birch midstory. Western tanagers were not significantly related with abundance of pineland dwarf mistletoe (&quot;Arceuthobium vaginatum&quot; ssp. &quot;cryptopodum&quot;) in ponderosa pine stands in central Colorado. The western tanager species was negatively associated with subalpine fir (&quot;A. lasiocarpa&quot;) cover in northern Rocky Mountain conifer forests.

===Food and feeding===
Western tanagers obtain their food by foliage gleaning and hawking. The degree to which each of these methods is used apparently varies across locations. For instance, in a California mixed conifer-oak forest consisting mainly of white fir, Douglas fir, incense-cedar, and California black oak, about 47% of western tanager foraging observations were gleaning, about 40% were hawking, and lunging and hovering occurred in about 6% and 7% of observations, respectively. In contrast, in the mainly Douglas fir-dominated communities of interior British Columbia, gleaning constituted 93.2% of western tanager foraging observations. Hawking only occurred in 3.7% of observations and hovering in 3.1%.

Western tanagers primarily glean from foliage. In the mixed conifer-oak woodland of California, 45% of their foraging observations were foliage gleaning. Western tanagers gleaned from twigs in 10% of observations and from branches in 5% of observations. Hawking constituted the remainder of western tanager foraging observations. In British Columbia, 88.3% of gleaning observations occurred on foliage, 10.5% on branches and twigs, and 1.2% on trunks.

Western tanagers eat fruits (~18%) and a wide range of insects (~82%). Fruits include hawthorn apples (&quot;Crataegus&quot; spp.), raspberries (&quot;Rubus&quot; spp.), mulberries (&quot;Morus&quot; spp.), elderberries (&quot;Sambucus&quot; spp.), serviceberries (&quot;Amelanchier&quot; spp.), and wild and cultivated cherries (&quot;Prunus&quot; spp.). They have been observed foraging on Perry&#x27;s agave (&quot;Agave parryi&quot;) nectar. Reports of western tanager eating eucalyptus (&quot;Eucalyptus&quot; spp.) nectar, Russian olive fruits, and human-provided food, including bird seed and dried fruit, were summarized. Western tanagers are major consumers of western spruce budworms (&quot;Choristoneura occidentalis&quot;), and they have been observed eating Douglas fir tussock moth larvae (&quot;Orgyia pseudotsugata&quot;). Hymenopterans, mostly wasps and ants, constituted 75% of insects in western tanager stomachs in August. The other insects were beetles (Coleoptera, 12%), mainly click beetles (Elateridae) and woodborers (Bupestridae), true bugs (Hemiptera, 8%), grasshoppers (Orthoptera, 4%), and caterpillars (Lepidoptera, 2%).

==Predators==
Several birds prey on western tanagers. Remains of a western tanager were found in a red-tailed hawk&#x27;s (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;) nest in Colorado. In southwestern Idaho, western tanager remains were reported in one of over 170 prairie falcon (&quot;Falco mexicanus&quot;) nests observed. Northern goshawks (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;), Mexican spotted owls (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot; spp. &quot;lucida&quot;), sharp-shinned hawks (&quot;A. striatus&quot;) and Cooper&#x27;s hawks (&quot;A. cooperii&quot;) are also western tanager predators. Accipiter hawks (Accipitrinae) and jays (Corvidae) are major predators of western tanagers. Domestic cats also preyed on western tanagers in British Columbia.

Clark&#x27;s nutcrackers (&quot;Nucifraga columbiana&quot;), northern pygmy owls (&quot;Glaucidium gnoma&quot;), great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), and jays such as scrub jays (&quot;Aphelocoma&quot; species), pinyon jays (&quot;Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus&quot;), and Steller&#x27;s jays (&quot;Cyanocitta stelleri&quot;) are typical avian predators of western tanager nests. Other reported nest predators include black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;), prairie rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus viridis&quot;), and bullsnakes (&quot;Pituophis catenifer&quot;).

Western tanager nests are parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds (&quot;Molothrus aster&quot;). Parasitism rates can be high, and can dramatically reduce the number of western tanagers fledged per nest.

<doc id="391902" wikidata="Q16152123" url="?curid=391902" title="Andrew Bartlett">
<text>Andrew John Julian Bartlett (born 4 August 1964) is an Australian politician, social worker, academic, and social campaigner who served as a Senator for Queensland from 1997 to 2008 and from 2017 to 2018. He represented the Australian Democrats in his first stint in the Senate, including as party leader from 2002 to 2004 and deputy leader from 2004 to 2008. In November 2017, he returned to the Senate as a member of the Australian Greens, replacing Larissa Waters after her disqualification during the parliamentary eligibility crisis. He resigned from the Senate in August 2018 in an unsuccessful attempt to win the House of Representatives seat of Brisbane, allowing Waters to fill his seat in advance of the 2019 election.

==Early life==
Bartlett was born in Brisbane on 4 August 1964. He is of Irish, Swiss, English and Greek descent – his great-great-grandfather, who is claimed to be the first Greek settler in Australia, arrived in Adelaide in 1840.

Bartlett holds the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Social Work from the University of Queensland. He worked for a community radio station from 1985 to 1986 and later as a social worker. He then worked as an electorate officer for Queensland Democrats senators Cheryl Kernot and John Woodley between 1990 and 1997.

==Political career==
===Entry into politics===
Bartlett has campaigned for gay rights. In 2004, he cried in the Senate chamber over a proposed law to define marriage as between a man and a woman, which he called an &quot;absolute disgrace&quot;.

===Leader of the Australian Democrats===

After the resignation of party leader Natasha Stott Despoja on 21 August 2002, Bartlett was elected as her replacement on 5 October 2002, defeating the temporary leader Brian Greig.

To a degree, Bartlett stabilised the Democrats&#x27; troubled party room and spoke strongly against the Government&#x27;s maltreatment of refugees and maladministration of the Department of Immigration. He also oversaw the Democrat senators&#x27; use of their potential balance of power role to influence increased funding for Medicare, protection of the welfare payments of sole parents, the unemployed and the disabled, and entitlement of some homosexual couples to superannuation entitlements equivalent to those enjoyed by heterosexual couples.

In December 2003, Bartlett resigned his Senate leadership. Accused by Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris of physical and verbally abusing her when she confronted him upon leaving the Senate chamber after a vote, Bartlett gave her an unreserved apology. He admitted to abusing and manhandling the Senator. Bartlett, who had been drinking at a Liberal Party function held just outside the chamber, was accused of stealing five bottles of wine from the function. Some time after Ferris had retrieved the wine, Bartlett approached Ferris, and was alleged to have gripped her arm and verbally abused her, both inside the chamber and along the way to an outside courtyard. Parliamentary video of part of the incident appeared to show that Bartlett was drunk in the chamber. Bartlett&#x27;s subsequent formal apology was accompanied by a bottle of wine, which Ferris described as &quot;quite inappropriate ... as an apology for drunken behaviour involving abuse and a physical attack.&quot; By contrast, Liberal Senator Brett Mason, who witnessed the incident, said &quot;Perhaps a little more was made of the incident than should have been made. I think it was overplayed by the media, and by everyone.&quot; Labor Senator Claire Moore was reported in &quot;The Bulletin&quot; magazine as saying Bartlett had been &quot;unfairly demonized.&quot;

Bartlett resumed the party&#x27;s parliamentary leadership in January 2004, giving an assurance that he would totally abstain from alcohol. However, the party&#x27;s support levels remained at the same low level to which they had fallen at the time of Stott Despoja&#x27;s resignation. He was unable to increase the party&#x27;s support leading up to the 2004 election in which the Democrats were defending three Senate seats. All three seats were lost—one going to the Greens and two to Liberals. The party polled what was at the time the lowest vote since their inception in 1977.

===Departure from the Democrats and Greens candidacy===
Following the 2004 election, Bartlett did not re-contest the leadership, instead taking on the deputy leadership under Lyn Allison. Bartlett was defeated at the 2007 election, polling only 1.88% of the primary vote in Queensland. The Democrat vote was even lower in other states, and the party lost all its remaining Senate seats. He left the Senate at the expiration of his term in June 2008.
In November 2009, Greens leader Bob Brown announced that Bartlett would contest the lower house seat of Brisbane at the 2010 federal election as a candidate for the Australian Greens. Bartlett came third in the seat in the 2010 election, gaining 21.3% of the vote with a swing to the Greens of just over 10%.

This was not the first time that Bartlett contested Brisbane and against the sitting Labor member Arch Bevis. 
Bartlett had first contested Brisbane in 1996 for the Australian Democrats when he received 9.04% of the vote. 

In May 2012, Bartlett ran for the Lord Mayoralty of Brisbane for the Greens, receiving 10.7% of the primary vote, a 2.3% increase on the previous election.

In 2015, years after the Democrats&#x27; parliamentary oblivion, the party was deregistered by the Australian Electoral Commission. Speaking as a former Democrats leader, Bartlett reflected that the party&#x27;s support of the Howard Government&#x27;s introduction of the GST was &quot;politically catastrophic&quot;, but the &quot;last straw&quot; for the party was the demise of Stott Despoja as leader in 2002:
Bartlett was again endorsed by the Greens as a Senate candidate for Queensland at the 2016 federal election. While he did not meet the quota for election, his colleague Senator Larissa Waters resigned her position on 18 July 2017 after discovering she held dual Australian and Canadian citizenship. She was ruled ineligible on 27 October 2017. As the second person on the 2016 Australian Greens Senate ticket, he replaced her after a recount. After his election was announced on 10 November, Bartlett was sworn in as a Senator for Queensland on 12 November 2017. Despite stirrings of a pre-selection showdown between himself and Waters for the next Senate election, Bartlett announced on 9 February 2018 that he would not seek to remain in the Senate, opting to seek pre-selection for the Queensland seat of Brisbane in the House of Representatives instead. On 16 June 2018, Bartlett announced that he would resign from the Senate at the end of August, to be replaced by Waters. The resignation was formally submitted to the Senate President Scott Ryan on 27 August 2018.

As announced, Bartlett contested the Division of Brisbane in the House of Representatives at the 2019 federal election receiving 22% of first preferences. Despite not winning the seat, he brought the Greens vote to its highest ever percentage in the Brisbane electorate, falling short of entering the two-party preferred vote behind Labor in second place, at 24.49%.

Bartlett contested the Electoral district of Clayfield in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland at the 2020 Queensland state election and received 17.61% of the vote.
