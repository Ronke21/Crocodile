<text>Günter Guillaume (1 February 1927 – 10 April 1995) was an East German spy who gathered intelligence as an agent for East Germany&#x27;s secret service, the Stasi, in West Germany. Guillaume became West German chancellor Willy Brandt&#x27;s secretary, and his discovery as a spy in 1973 led to Brandt&#x27;s downfall in the Guillaume affair.

==Early life==
Günter Karl Heinz Guillaume was born on 1 February 1927, at 31 Choriner Straße in Prenzlauer Berg, then a working-class district of Berlin. He was the only child of Karl Ernst Guillaume, a pianist who played in bars and theatres, where he provided background music for silent films, and Johanna Old Pauline (), a hairdresser. His parents, who had married four months before Günter&#x27;s birth, were both native to Berlin. Due to the combination of the Great Depression and the introduction of sound films, the Guillaumes suffered financial hardship. These experiences made the extremist policies being presented by Adolf Hitler and Nazi Party attractive to Karl Guillaume, and he joined in March 1934.

Guillaume was conscripted as a Flakhelfer in 1944.
On January 17, 1944, Guillaume applied for admission to the NSDAP and was admitted on April 20 of the same year (membership number 9,709,880).

==Career==
In 1956, he and his wife Christel, also a Stasi agent, emigrated to West Germany on Stasi orders to penetrate and spy on West Germany&#x27;s political system. Rising through the hierarchy of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, he became a close aide to West German chancellor Willy Brandt.

In 1974, West German authorities discovered that Guillaume was spying for the East German government. The resulting scandal, the Guillaume Affair, led to Brandt&#x27;s resigning the chancellorship. On 15 December 1975, Guillaume was sentenced to 13 years in prison for treason; his wife Christel, to eight years. In 1981, Guillaume was returned to East Germany in exchange for Western spies caught by the Eastern Bloc. Christel, who had returned earlier that year, divorced him.

In East Germany, Guillaume was received and celebrated as a hero, worked as a spy trainer, and published his autobiography &quot;Die Aussage&quot; (&quot;The Statement&quot;) in 1988. Two years later, he married his second wife, nurse Elke Bröhl. Guillaume and East German spymaster Markus Wolf said that Willy Brandt&#x27;s downfall was not intended, and that the affair was among the Stasi&#x27;s biggest mistakes. After &quot;Die Wende&quot; and German reunification, the reunified Germany granted Guillaume immunity from any further prosecutions. 

Guillaume was called as a witness for the prosecution in Markus Wolf&#x27;s trial for treason in 1993. In his testimony, he claimed he &quot;could barely remember details of events stretching back over forty years&quot; and in response to most questions put by the prosecution and the presiding judge, Guillaume only referred them to his autobiography.

==Death==
Guillaume died of heart attack and a stroke on 10 April 1995, in Petershagen/Eggersdorf, near Berlin. Guillaume&#x27;s first wife died on 20 March 2004.

==In culture==
The Brandt-Guillaume story is told in the play &quot;Democracy&quot; by Michael Frayn. It follows Brandt&#x27;s political career as West Germany&#x27;s first left-of-centre chancellor in 40 years, and his fall because of his assistant. It portrays Guillaume as in conflict by spying on Brandt while growing to admire him.

<text>31 (thirty-one) is the natural number following 30 and preceding 32. It is a prime number.

== Mathematics ==
31 is the 11th prime number. It is a superprime and a self prime (after 3, 5, and 7), as no integer added up to its base 10 digits results in 31. It is the third Mersenne prime of the form 2&quot;n&quot; − 1, and the eighth Mersenne prime &quot;exponent&quot;, in-turn yielding the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing: 2,147,483,647. After 3, it is the second Mersenne prime not to be a double Mersenne prime, while the 31st prime number (127) is the second double Mersenne prime, following 7. On the other hand, the thirty-first triangular number is the perfect number 496, of the form 2(5 − 1)(25 − 1) by the Euclid-Euler theorem. 31 is also a &quot;primorial prime&quot; like its twin prime (29), as well as both a lucky prime and a happy number like its dual permutable prime in decimal (13).

31 is the number of regular polygons with an odd number of sides that are known to be constructible with compass and straightedge, from combinations of known Fermat primes of the form 22&quot;n&quot; + 1 (they are 3, 5, 17, 257 and 65537).

Only two numbers have a sum-of-divisors equal to 31: 16 (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16) and 25 (1 + 5 + 25), respectively the square of 4, and of 5. In total, only thirty-one integers are not the sum of distinct squares (31 is the sixteenth such number, where the largest is 124). 

31 is the 11th and final consecutive supersingular prime. After 31, the only supersingular primes are 41, 47, 59, and 71.

31 is the first prime centered pentagonal number, the fifth centered triangular number, and the first non-trivial centered decagonal number.

For the Steiner tree problem, 31 is the number of possible Steiner topologies for Steiner trees with 4 terminals.

At 31, the Mertens function sets a new low of −4, a value which is not subceded until 110.

31 is a repdigit in base 2 (11111) and in base 5 (111).

The cube root of 31 is the value of  correct to four significant figures:
:formula_1

The thirty-first digit in the fractional part of the decimal expansion for pi in base-10 is the last consecutive non-zero digit represented, starting from the beginning of the expansion (i.e, the thirty-second single-digit string is the first formula_2); the partial sum of digits up to this point is formula_3 31 is also the prime partial sum of digits of the decimal expansion of pi after the eighth digit.

The first five Euclid numbers of the form &quot;p1&quot; × &quot;p2&quot; × &quot;p3&quot; × ... × &quot;pn&quot; + 1 (with &quot;pn&quot; the &quot;n&quot;th prime) are prime:

* 3 = 2 + 1
* 7 = 2 × 3 + 1
* 31 = 2 × 3 × 5 + 1
* 211 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 + 1 and
* 2311 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 + 1

The following term, 30031 = 59 × 509 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 + 1, is composite. The next prime number of this form has a largest prime &quot;p&quot; of 31: 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11 × 13 × ... × 31 + 1 ≈ 8.2 × 1033.

While 13 and 31 in base-ten are the proper first duo of two-digit permutable primes and emirps with distinct digits in base ten, 11 is the only two-digit permutable prime that is its own permutable prime. Meanwhile 1310 in ternary is 1113 and 3110 in quinary is 1115, with 1310 in quaternary represented as 314 and 3110 as 1334 (their mirror permutations 3314 and 134, equivalent to 61 and 7 in decimal, respectively, are also prime). (11, 13) form the third twin prime pair between the fifth and sixth prime numbers whose indices add to 11, itself the prime index of 31. Where 31 is the prime index of the fourth Mersenne prime, the first three Mersenne primes (3, 7, 31) sum to the thirteenth prime number, 41. 13 and 31 are also the smallest values to reach record lows in the Mertens function, of −3 and −4 respectively. 

The numbers 31, 331, 3331, , , , and are all prime. For a time it was thought that every number of the form 3w1 would be prime. However, the next nine numbers of the sequence are composite; their factorisations are:

* = 17 × 
* = 673 × 
* = 307 × 
* = 19 × 83 × 
* = 523 × 3049 × 
* = 607 × 1511 × 1997 × 
* = 181 × 
* = 199 × and
* = 31 × 1499 × .

The next term (3171) is prime, and the recurrence of the factor 31 in the last composite member of the sequence above can be used to prove that no sequence of the type RwE or ERw can consist only of primes, because every prime in the sequence will periodically divide further numbers.

31 is the maximum number of areas inside a circle created from the edges and diagonals of an inscribed six-sided polygon, per Moser&#x27;s circle problem. It is also equal to the sum of the maximum number of areas generated by the first five &quot;n&quot;-sided polygons: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and as such, 31 is the first member that diverges from twice the value of its previous member in the sequence, by 1.

Icosahedral symmetry contains a total of thirty-one axes of symmetry; six five-fold, ten three-fold, and fifteen two-fold.

== In other fields ==
31 equal temperament is a popular microtonal tuning for musical instruments because it provides a good approximation of harmonic intervals.

Thirty-one is also a slang term for masturbation in Turkish.

<text>Scott Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base in St. Clair County, Illinois, near Belleville and O&#x27;Fallon, east-southeast of downtown St. Louis. Scott Field was one of 32 Air Service training camps established after the United States entered World War I in April 1917. It is headquarters of Air Mobility Command (AMC) and its showcase wing, and it is also the headquarters of the U.S. Transportation Command, a Unified Combatant Command that coordinates transportation across all the services.

The base is operated by the 375th Air Mobility Wing (375 AMW) and is also home to the Air Force Reserve Command&#x27;s 932d Airlift Wing (932 AW) and the Illinois Air National Guard&#x27;s 126th Air Refueling Wing (126 ARW), the latter two units being operationally gained by AMC.

The base currently employs 13,000 people, 5,100 civilians with 5,500 active-duty Air Force, and an additional 2,400 Air National Guard and Reserve personnel. It was announced in June 2014 that two new cybersecurity squadrons will be added to the three currently on base.

Its airfield is also used by civilian aircraft, with civilian operations at the base referring to the facility as MidAmerica St. Louis Airport. MidAmerica has operated as a Joint Use Airport since beginning operations in November 1997.

==History==

===World War I===
During World War I, Secretary of War Newton Baker advocated an expanded role for aviation. Business and political leaders on both sides of the Mississippi River wanted the Midwest to be chosen as a site for one of the new &quot;flying fields.&quot; Aerial expert Albert Bond Lambert joined the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce and directors of the Greater Belleville Board of Trade to negotiate a lease agreement for nearly 624 acres of land.

After inspecting several sites, the U.S. War Department agreed to the lease June 14, 1917. Congress appropriated $10 million for its construction, and 2,000 laborers and carpenters were immediately put to work. The layout of Scott Field was typical of aviation fields built during World War I. Construction began in June 1917. The government gave the Unit Construction Company 60 days to erect approximately 60 buildings, lay a mile-long railroad spur, and to level off an airfield with a 1,600 foot landing circle. Construction was underway when the government announced, on July 20, 1917, that it would name the new field after Corporal Frank S. Scott, the first enlisted service member killed in an aviation crash. Scott had died after an unexpected engine failure had brought down the aircraft that Lieutenant Lewis Rockwell had been giving him an orientation flight in at College Park, Maryland, on September 28, 1912.

Scott Field began as an aviation-training field for World War I pilots in August 1917 when the 11th and 21st Aero Squadrons from Kelly Field, Texas, arrived. Construction was completed in August, and the first flight from Scott Field occurred 2 September 1917. Flying instruction began 11 September 1917. Later the 85th and 86th Aero Squadrons arrived, and more than 300 pilots and many ground units were trained for service by the war&#x27;s end in 1918.

Training units assigned to Scott Field were:
* Post Headquarters, Scott Field – October 1919
* 114th Aero Squadron, February 1918
: Re-designated as Squadron &quot;A&quot;, July–November 1918
* 221st Aero Squadron, December 1917
: Re-designated as Squadron &quot;B&quot;, July–November 1918 
* 242d Aero Squadron (II), April 1918
: Re-designated as Squadron &quot;C&quot;, July–November 1918
* Squadron &quot;D&quot;, July–November 1918 
* Flying School Detachment (Consolidation of Squadrons A–D), November 1918 – November 1919

By 2 September, William Couch, a civilian flying instructor, and Scott Field Commander, Major George E. A. Reinburg, made the first flight from Scott Field in a Standard J-1 two-seater biplane. At least seven J-1s were already on Scott; by the time the first Curtiss JN-4D &quot;Jenny&quot; arrived. Operable from the front or rear seat, the 8-cylinder, 90- horsepower, Jenny would become the primary trainer used on Scott Field. Everything moved fast in a wartime environment, including the dangerous act of learning to fly airplanes. A judgment error or weather shift could produce severe accidents in the fragile aircraft of the day, so it soon became apparent that Scott Field needed a medical air evacuation capability.

Determined to improve the recovery of Scott&#x27;s downed pilots, Captains Charles Bayless (post surgeon), Early Hoag (officer-in-charge of flying) and A.J. Etheridge (post engineer), along with Second Lieutenant Seth Thomas, designed two air ambulances, or hospital planes—using a configuration likely modeled after one in use at Gerstner Field, Louisiana. By the summer of 1918, Scott Field&#x27;s engineering department had completed the rear cockpit modifications needed to convert two Jennies. Not long thereafter, on 24 August 1918, as aviator with a broken leg became Scott&#x27;s first air evacuated patient.

Also reassuring was the support Scott Field enjoyed from the local community. Plenty of curious sightseers came just to watch the construction or catch a glimpse of airplane activity, but many from the local community also gave morale support to their &quot;Sammies&quot; (Uncle Sam&#x27;s boys). They hosted dances and receptions, established a library branch on the field, and invited soldiers into their homes for Thanksgiving dinners. Likewise, Scott Field hosted sporting events with their community neighbors. On 17 August 1918, they invited the public to attend a field meet and flight exhibition—Scott&#x27;s first air show.

Flying was discontinued at Scott Field after the war and the base population dropped. The War Department purchased Scott Field in 1919 for $119, 285.84

===Inter-War period===
Scott Field&#x27;s future became uncertain after the 11 November 1918 armistice with Germany and the end of World War I. Large scale demobilization closed many U.S. airfields. Scott&#x27;s remaining units were organized into a Flying School Detachment, and the field itself was designated as a storage site for demobilized equipment. Welcome news came early in 1919, with the War Department&#x27;s announcement of its decision to purchase Scott Field, a decision influenced by Scott&#x27;s central location and exceptional purchase price of $119,285.84. This gave Scott a promise of a future; however, it still lacked a mission.

Scott was transformed into a lighter-than-air (LTA) station in 1921, with the transfer of the Army Balloon and Airship School from Brooks Field, Texas. Lighter-than-air ships were used at Scott Field to research the capabilities of aerial photography, meteorology and conduct altitude experiments. The most notable addition was the new airship hangar. Constructed between September 1921 and January 1923, it was three blocks long, nearly one block wide and 15 stories high. One report commented that 100,000 men—nearly the entire U.S. Army in 1923—could have stood in formation inside it. Scott&#x27;s hangar was second in size only to the naval station hangar in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the largest one in the world at the time. The base also had hydrogen production facilities, which were enhanced significantly around 1923.

Consistent with the transformation of the facility, Major John A. Paegelow was selected as commanding officer of the facility in 1923, succeeding Colonel C. G. Hall who left the facility &quot;to pursue a course of instruction in rigid airships with the Navy.&quot; Paegelow had been during World War I the commander of all Allied lighter-than-air activities on the warfront.

A couple of highlights of Scott&#x27;s LTA era (1921–1937) include the 74-mph speed record for dirigibles, set by Scott Field&#x27;s TC-1 in 1923, and the American free balloon altitude record of , set in 1927, by Captain Hawthorne C. Gray. Captain Gray would have set a world record later that same year had he survived that flight.

In the late 1920s, emphasis shifted from airships to balloons. In 1929, the 12th Airship Company was inactivated and replaced the next day by the 1st Balloon Company. Airplanes began to dominate activities at Scott Field by the mid-1930s. A series of airship mishaps led the Chief of the Army Air Corps to recommend an end to LTA activities in May 1937, and the following month Scott&#x27;s LTA era came to an abrupt end.

Scott Field&#x27;s central location was advantageous when it was considered for the relocation site of the General Headquarters Air Force (GHQAF), which managed the combat arm of the U.S. Army. Scott Field grew from 628 acres in 1938 to 1,882 acres in 1939. Most of the frame World War I and lighter-than-air constructions were torn down—only a few, such as the 9th Airstrip Squadron headquarters/barracks building, a brick theater and nine sets of brick non-commissioned officers&#x27; quarters at the south end of the field were saved.

New housing, industrial and administrative buildings were completed by May 1939. The expansion program continued into 1940 with the construction of 21 more buildings, including a 200-man barracks, a 300,000-gallon elevated water tank, a 43-bed hospital, Hangar No. 1 and a General Headquarters Air Force office.

Scott Field, as it existed at the end of the 1940 expansion program, is listed as the Scott Field Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.

===World War II===


With the outbreak of World War II, the GHQAF move to Scott was cancelled. Instead, Scott Field reverted to its former role as a training installation. On 1 June 1939, one of Scott&#x27;s Balloon Groups was redesignated as a headquarters unit of the Scott Field Branch of the Army Air Corps Technical Schools. Subsequently, various technical schools moved to Scott. Its communications training era began in September 1940 with the opening of the Radio School.

After September 1940, the primary wartime mission of Scott was to train skilled radio operator/maintainers; to produce, as the Radio School&#x27;s slogan proclaimed, &quot;the best damned radio operators in the world!&quot; Scott&#x27;s graduates flew in aircraft and operated command and control communications in every Theater of the War, and were often referred to as the &quot;Eyes and Ears of the Army Air Forces.&quot; By the end of World War II, Scott&#x27;s Radio School—becoming something of a &quot;Communications University of the Army Air Forces&quot;, where it expanded during the war to fill about 46 large school buildings on base. It was from this course that many specialized radio and communications courses evolved, and had graduated 77,370 radio operator/mechanics. While all had been important to the nation&#x27;s victory, two of the schools better known graduates were Medal of Honor recipient Technical Sergeant Forrest Lee Vosler, and the future first Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force, Paul Airey.

Though the Radio School was the primary World War II-era mission, it was not intended to be Scott&#x27;s only mission. The Air Corps had also planned for Scott to become a major air terminal due to its centralized location in the United States. In 1940, a $1 million project began to construct four mile-long concrete runways. Though not fully completed until November 1942, the portions that were complete provided a capability to give advanced flying school graduates instruction in instrument and night flying, navigation, photography, and administrative flights. By late 1943, the Radio School students were in the air as well, practicing code transmission under actual flight conditions. Unfortunately, airfield operations had to be sharply curtailed in May 1944, after an accidental tool-spark set fire to Hangar 1—Scott&#x27;s only hangar. Repairs were not completed until May 1945.

===United States Air Force===
The U.S. Air Force became a separate service on 18 September 1947, and on 13 January 1948, Scott Field was re-designated as Scott Air Force Base and the 3310th Technical Training Wing assumed host responsibility from the 3505th Army Air Forces Base Unit. In 1948, Scott&#x27;s Radio School was re-organized, with the radio operator and control tower courses relocated to Keesler AFB, Mississippi. In addition, the fixed wire courses at Scott went to Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming, so that Scott had room to expand its radio mechanic school.

In early 1949, Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson initiated a series of economic measures throughout the armed forces. His purpose was to effect greater utilization of the assets assigned to all services. As a result of these actions, a number of bases transferred between major commands, schools moved, and other bases closed. Because of these DOD-directed initiatives, Headquarters USAF decided to move Air Training Command (ATC) headquarters from Barksdale AFB, Louisiana to Scott AFB, effective 17 October 1949. The new ATC headquarters established in Building P-3, which was originally designed to be Headquarters, General Headquarters Air Force (GHQ Air Force). Air Training Command moved its headquarters into the building on 17 October 1949. At Scott, ATC absorbed the functions of its previous three subordinate headquarters—Flying, Technical, and Indoctrination Divisions.

Throughout the USAF transition, Scott&#x27;s primary mission remained technical training; however, Scott&#x27;s aeromedical evacuation mission continued to grow. By the end of 1950, Douglas C-54 Skymasters were bringing 200 patients a week to Scott.

In 1957, Military Air Transport Service (MATS) moved to Scott AFB to help facilitate management of its east and west coast units, and between July and October 1957, ATC transferred its headquarters to Randolph AFB, Texas. During the changeover some technical training continued, however, by February 1959, the few remaining technical courses left Scott for other bases. As part of the air mobility transition, ATC&#x27;s 3310th Technical Training Wing was re-designated on 1 October 1957, as the 1405th Air Base Wing, a MATS organization. With the transition complete, Scott&#x27;s new primary mission became air mobility.

With the re-alignment to MATS, Aeromedical evacuation continued to grow and in 1964, Scott&#x27;s host wing was re-designated as the 1405th Aeromedical Transport Wing. Increasing importance placed on airlift and the decision by the Navy to set up its own transport command led to the Military Air Transport Service being re-designated as Military Airlift Command (MAC) in 1966. Associated with this reorganization, the 1405th was discontinued and its mission and resources were absorbed by the newly activated AFCON 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing. The addition of a fleet of C-9A Nightingales in 1968 further expanded the 375th&#x27;s aeromedical mission. In 1973, Scott&#x27;s Patient Airlift Center coordinated 61 aeromedical missions to bring 357 former Vietnam War Prisoners of War back to the United States. In June 1973, the 1400th Air Base Wing inactivated, the 375th Air Base Group (today the 375th Mission Support Group) reactivated, and host wing responsibilities reverted to the 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing. By 1975, the 375th gained responsibility for the worldwide aeromedical evacuation system.

The 375th gained another mission in 1978; Operational Support Airlift. Scott received its first T-39A Sabreliner in 1962. After 1978, the 375th was managing a dispersed continental fleet of 104 Sabreliners flying a combined 92,000 hours a year. The CT-39As were phased out in 1984, the same year the first Gates C-21A Learjets arrived at Scott.

As the 375th reorganized, it transitioned to a Military Airlift Wing in 1990 and an Airlift Wing in 1991. In 1992, Military Airlift Command inactivated and its personnel and assets were combined with others to form Air Mobility Command (AMC). Later in the 1990s, two new partners joined Scott&#x27;s team, MidAmerica Airport and the Illinois Air National Guard 126th Air Refueling Wing. A 1987 Federal Aviation Administration authorization, followed by a 1991 joint use agreement resulted in the 1998 opening of the new MidAmerica Airport. Similarly, the 1992 realignment of refueling units to AMC, plus the planned MidAmerica construction, led to a 1995 Base Realignment and Closure committee recommendation to relocate the 126th Air Refueling Wing to Scott AFB.

AMC&#x27;s 15th and 21st Air Forces became Expeditionary Mobility Task Forces in 2003. They, along with all AMC wings and independent groups realigned to a newly activated 18th Air Force. The new ready mobility operations capability would speed AMC&#x27;s support for contingencies and humanitarian missions. In 2003, age, noise, maintenance and lack of demand led to the retirement of the C-9A Nightingale. In the years that followed, the C-21A fleet was reorganized and reduced. These events caused a flying mission restructuring that today has Scott using a diverse mix of assigned and non-assigned aircraft to support aeromedical airlift, operational support airlift and air refueling missions.

The 375th Airlift Wing officially became the 375th Air Mobility Wing on 30 September 2009. The Total Force Integration effort called for the creation of an associate unit consisting of active duty KC-135 pilots, boom operators, and maintainers who worked side by side with their counterparts in the 126th Air Refueling Wing. The 375th Operation Group staff had administrative responsibilities for 135 aircrew members and maintainers under the 906th Air Refueling Squadron, a unit that moved from Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota. The 126th Air Refueling Wing maintained the operational direction and control of the mission execution responsibility of these Airmen. Scott AFB served as one of six locations in Air Mobility Command and one of 10 throughout the Air Force where TFI efforts unfolded.

On June 25, 2014, the base was awarded two new cybersecurity squadrons that will add over 300 personnel, and an additional $16 million infrastructure improvements. The base presently has three cyber units.

<doc id="392400" wikidata="Q4788249" url="?curid=392400" title="Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>More than 96% of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to one of its three autochthonous constituent peoples (): Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats. The term &quot;constituent&quot; refers to the fact that these three ethnic groups are explicitly mentioned in the constitution, and that none of them can be considered a minority or immigrant. The most easily recognisable feature that distinguishes the three ethnic groups is their religion, with Bosniaks predominantly Muslim, Serbs predominantly Eastern Orthodox, and Croats Catholic.

Bosniaks, Croats, and Serbs speak the Shtokavian dialect of a pluricentric language known in linguistics as Serbo-Croatian. The question of standard language is resolved in such a way that three constituent peoples have their educational and cultural institutions in the standard varieties, which are considered official languages at sub-state levels: Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian.

A Y chromosome haplogroup study published in 2005 found that &quot;three main groups of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in spite of some quantitative differences, share a large fraction of the same ancient gene pool distinctive for the Balkan area&quot;. However, the study also found that Serbs and Bosniaks are genetically closer to each other than either of them are to Croats.

== Historical background ==

While Kingdom of Bosnia existed, no specific Bosnian identity emerged during medieval times. In Bosnia and Herzegovina during the Ottoman rule, the population did not identify with national categories, except for a few intellectuals from urban areas who considered themselves to be Croats or Serbs. The population of Bosnia and Herzegovina primarily identified itself by religion, using the terms Turk (for Muslims), &quot;Hrišćani&quot; (Christians) or Greeks (for the Orthodox) and &quot;Kršćani&quot; or Latins (for the Catholics). The Christians, both the Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox, were organised in their respective millets, the religious communities with internal autonomy. The Catholics identified more with the Croatians, while the Eastern Orthodox with the Serbian nation, respectively. For Muslims, identity was more related to defence of local privileges, but it did not call into question the allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. The use of the term &quot;Bosniak&quot; at that time did not have a national meaning but a regional one.

When Austria-Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, national identification was still a foreign concept to Bosnian Muslims. The new Austro-Hungarian authorities tried to impose a collective Bosnian identity to curb Croatian and Serbian nationalism, going so far as to forbid the usage of Croatian or Serbian names in the title of cultural associations. The idea of collective identity was met with opposition from the Croat, Serb and Muslim elites, and was accepted only by a small number of emerging modernising Muslims. The Christian elites in Bosnia and Herzegovina accepted Croatian and Serbian identities as their own, which resulted in a rapid rise of Croatian and Serbian nationalism in the country. The Muslims, on the other hand, gathered around their religious and landowning elites, requesting religious autonomy. The Austro-Hungarian authorities eventually started to accept and later favored such consolidation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

After World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina was incorporated into the newly established Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). The Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were the constituent (&quot;old&quot;) nations. Although the new government changed the power dynamic among the ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the communitarianism inherited from Austria-Hungary remained dominant. This was especially evident in the voting patterns. The same situation was present in the whole of Yugoslavia, not just Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serbs and Croats voted for their respective parties, of which several existed, while the Muslims voted for just one, the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO). During the reign of King Alexander I, a modern single Yugoslav identity was unsuccessfully propagated to erase the particularistic identities. Serb and Croat populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina saw Belgrade and Zagreb as their national centers, while at the same time, the conflict between the two groups deepened. At the same time, the decline of the Muslim elite caused an identity crisis among Muslims. With Croatian and Serbian nationalism competing for their inclination, they instead found refuge in national indeterminism or Yugoslavism. In 1939, the Serbian and Croatian political leadership agreed on the partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, creating the Banovina of Croatia. After its creation, the leaders of JMO and the Muslim religious elites created a movement for the autonomy of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

During World War II, in 1941, Germany invaded Yugoslavia and established its puppet, the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), into which Bosnia and Herzegovina was incorporated. The majority of Bosnian Muslims considered themselves to be ethnic Croats at the time. This period saw the destruction of traditional communitarianism in favor of exclusive nationalisms, with Serbs being heavily persecuted by the Croat Ustaše, while the Serb Chetniks murdered Muslims as a reprisal. The communist Yugoslav Partisans emerged as the strongest anti-fascist force in the country. The Partisan movement addressed Serbs, Muslims and Croats, even though most of their activity was organised by Serbs initially. In 1943, the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the main political body of the Partisans in Bosnia and Herzegovina, established Bosnia and Herzegovina as a distinct territory, guaranteeing &quot;full equality of all Serbs, Muslims and Croats&quot;.

With the formation of Socialist Yugoslavia, there were six republics and five constitutive nations, adding Macedonians and Montenegrins (whose identities were not earlier recognized); the Bosnian Muslims were recognized only in the late 1960s. For the 1961 census, a new ethnic category was introduced–&quot;Muslims&quot;–with which 972,954 Bosnians identified. In 1964, the &quot;Muslims&quot; were declared a &quot;narod&quot; (&quot;people&quot;), as the other five &quot;peoples&quot;, but were not ascribed a national republic. In 1968, the Bosnian Central Committee declared that &quot;...Muslims are a distinct nation&quot;. For the 1971 census, accordingly, &quot;Muslims, in the sense of a nation&quot; was introduced.

== Decision of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina ==
On 12 February 1998, Alija Izetbegović, at the time Chair of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted proceedings before the Constitutional Court for an evaluation of the consistency of the Constitution of the Republika Srpska and the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The request was supplemented on 30 March 1998 when the applicant specified which provisions of the Entities&#x27; Constitutions he considered to be unconstitutional.

The four partial decisions were made in 2000, by which many of the articles of the constitutions of entities were found to be unconstitutional, which had a great impact on the politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina because there was a need to adjust the current state in the country with the decision of the Court. A narrow majority (5-4) ruled in favor of the applicant. In its decision, among other things, the Court stated:

The formal name of this item is &quot;U-5/98&quot;, but it is widely known as the &quot;Decision on the constituency of peoples&quot;, referring to the Court&#x27;s interpretation of the significance of the phrase &quot;constituent peoples&quot; used in the Preamble of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision was also the basis for other notable cases that came before the court.

== Inter-ethnic relations ==

Serbs tend to be Orthodox Christian, Croats tend to be Catholic, and Bosniaks tend to be Muslim. Tensions between these groups were expressed in terms of religion, and religious symbols continue to be used for nationalist purposes. Fundamentalists existed on all sides; so, in regards to propaganda supported by the views of religious leaders, the Bosnian War took on some features of a &quot;religious war.&quot; Historical stereotypes and prejudice were further established by experiences of war. On the other hand, it has been found that direct individual experiences of war did not influence the individual&#x27;s measured ethno-nationalism. The situation still impedes the development of relations post-war. It has been found that ethnic civil war alone does not have a tendency to increase the abundance of ethno-nationalism in a country, though this is context-dependent. Karin Dyrstad argues that the Dayton agreement, although intended to improve relations following the war, damaged them and segregated the country even further. Her argument lies on her finding that local policy change provides the context that determines the lasting effect that ethnic civil wars have on ethnonationalism. So, the Dayton agreement, she argues, is the local policy change that propelled the Bosnian War into having the disastrous post-war effects on inter-ethnic relations that it did. Conversely, the pluralistic makeup of the Dayton agreement suggested it would have a beneficial effect on inter-ethnic relations within the country. Before the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina had rather good inter-ethnic relations compared to other Western Balkan states. In the years following the war, all three ethnic groups experienced a drastic increase in the prevalence of ethno-nationalism, the group with the most dramatic shift being the Serbs. This increased ethno-nationalism contributed to the deterioration of inter-ethnic relations in the country. The prevalence of this ethno-nationalism can be displayed, in part, by the finding that, upon return, almost all displaced persons moved into an area in which their activated ethnic identity aligned with that of the majority. To further exacerbate ethnic homogeneity following the war, ethnic elites were known to sometimes halt the return of displaced persons to their pre-war place of residence. 

The magnitude of communal exposure to violence during the Bosnian War has continued to have significant resounding effects on inter-ethnic relations and the political system, even after twenty years. It has been found that communities that had a higher exposure to violence continue to have lower levels of inter-ethnic trust and associate more with their ethnic political party. This leads to ethnic voting, otherwise known as voting along ethnic party lines; though, the levels of ethnic voting have begun to dwindle in recent elections, suggesting the violence&#x27;s effect on ethnic voting is beginning to decrease. Still, a lasting effect of this violence is that it eroded social networks that extended beyond an individual&#x27;s ethnic group and diminished the probability of reforming them. Since discussions of the Bosnian War are often contained to the microcosm of an individual&#x27;s predominantly homogenous social network, there tends to be an absence of opposing viewpoints, which cements ethnic boundaries based on ethnically biased collective memories. The evidence for this is strengthened by Hadzic et al.&#x27;s finding that those with social ties that are almost strictly contained to their own ethnic group also tend to have lower levels of inter-ethnic trust than those that do not. They also found that the Bosnian War led to increased ethnic homogeneity, which has been shown to influence government spending on ethnically homogenous areas in a way meant to further induce ethnic voting. 

Trends in the geographic concentration of the development of more ethnically homogeneous areas during the war contributed to the location of the eventual Inter-Entity Boundary Line between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. As a result, the differences in the ethnic makeups of the two entities are drastic; it has been estimated that Bosniaks make up around 73% of the population of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Serbs make up around 81% of the population of the Republika Srpska. All of these factors help to explain the extremity of political polarization along ethnic cleavages, which Larisa Kurtovic termed &quot;ethnic hyper-representation.&quot; Hadzic et al. argue that ethnic parties are harming Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s development and preventing the betterment of inter-ethnic relations, as they are incentivized to withhold universally beneficial policies in order to avoid unintentionally helping out-group members. This argument is reinforced by the counteractive implications of the slogan of the Republika Srpska&#x27;s governing party: &quot;RS forever and B&amp;H while it has to last.&quot; Politicizing ethnicity makes it a focal point of people&#x27;s everyday lives, driving behavior, cognition, and their experience of emotion. In effect, this politicization perpetuates the poor inter-ethnic relations that have continued to embody Bosnia and Herzegovina since at least the adoption of the Dayton Agreement.

<doc id="392403" wikidata="Q172083" url="?curid=392403" title="Omar Bongo">
<text>Omar Bongo Ondimba (born Albert-Bernard Bongo; 30 January 1935 – 8 June 2009) was a Gabonese politician who was the second president of Gabon from 1967 until his death in 2009. Bongo was promoted to key positions as a young official under Gabon&#x27;s first President Léon M&#x27;ba in the 1960s, before being elected the second vice-president in his own right in 1966. In 1967, he succeeded M&#x27;ba to become the country&#x27;s president, upon the latter&#x27;s death.

Bongo headed the single-party regime of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG) until 1990, when, faced with public pressure, he was forced to introduce multi-party politics into Gabon. His political survival despite intense opposition to his rule in the early 1990s seemed to stem once again from consolidating power by bringing most of the major opposition leaders at the time to his side. The 1993 presidential election was extremely controversial but ended with his re-election then and the subsequent elections of 1998 and 2005. His respective parliamentary majorities increased and the opposition becoming more subdued with each succeeding election. After Cuban leader Fidel Castro stepped down in February 2008, Bongo became the world&#x27;s longest-ruling non-royal leader. He was one of the longest serving non-royal rulers before his death. Throughout his regime, he received strong diplomatic, financial and military backing from France (tied to the presence of French oil giant Elf and subsequently Total in the country).

Bongo was criticised for in effect having worked for himself, his family and local elites and not for Gabon and its people. For instance, French green politician Eva Joly claimed that during Bongo&#x27;s long reign, despite an oil-led GDP per capita growth to one of the highest levels in Africa, Gabon built only 5 km of freeway a year and still had one of the world&#x27;s highest infant mortality rates by the time of his death in 2009. Press freedom was curtailed throughout the regime, which typically banned news outlets critical of Bongo or his entourage. He is also suspected to have been involved in assassinations including those of Ndouna Dépénaud, Joseph Rendjambé and (in France) Robert Luong. After Bongo&#x27;s death in June 2009, his son Ali Bongo, who had long been assigned key ministerial responsibilities by his father, was elected to succeed him in August of that year. Ali Bongo was overthrown in 2023 by his cousin, so that the Bongo family remains in power.

==Early life==
The youngest of twelve siblings, Albert-Bernard Bongo was born on 30 January 1935 in Lewai (since renamed Bongoville), French Equatorial Africa, a town of the Haut-Ogooué province in what is now southeastern Gabon near the border with the Republic of the Congo. He was a member of the small Bateke ethnic group. He changed his name to El Hadj Omar Bongo when he converted to Islam in 1973. After completing his primary and secondary education in Brazzaville (then the capital of French Equatorial Africa), Bongo held a job at the Post and Telecommunications Public Services, before joining the French military where he served as a second lieutenant and then as a first lieutenant in the Air Force, in Brazzaville, Bangui and Fort Lamy (present-day N&#x27;djamena, Chad) successively, before being honourably discharged as captain.

==Political career==

===Pre-Presidency===
After Gabon&#x27;s independence in 1960, Albert-Bernard Bongo began his political career, rapidly rising through a succession of positions under President Léon M&#x27;ba. Bongo campaigned for M. Sandoungout in Haut Ogooué in the 1961 parliamentary election, choosing not to run for election in his own right; Sandoungout was elected and became Minister of Health. Bongo worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a time, and he was named Assistant Director of the Presidential Cabinet in March 1962; he was named Director seven months later. In 1964, during the only coup attempt in 20th-century Gabon, M&#x27;ba was kidnapped and Bongo was held in a military camp in Libreville, though M&#x27;ba was restored to power two days later.

On 24 September 1965, he was appointed as Presidential Representative and placed in charge of defence and coordination. He was then appointed Minister of Information and Tourism, initially on an interim basis, then formally holding the position in August 1966. M&#x27;ba, whose health was declining, appointed Bongo as Vice-President of Gabon on 12 November 1966. In the presidential election held on 19 March 1967, M&#x27;ba was re-elected as President and Bongo was elected as Vice-President during the same election. Bongo was in effective control of Gabon since November 1966 during President Léon M&#x27;ba&#x27;s long illness.

===Single-party rule===

Bongo became President on 2 December 1967, following the death of M&#x27;ba four days earlier, and was installed by de Gaulle and influential French leaders. Aged 32, Bongo was Africa&#x27;s fourth youngest president at the time, after captain Michel Micombero of Burundi and sergeant Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo. In March 1968 Bongo decreed Gabon to be a one-party state and changed the name of the Gabonese Independence Party, the Bloc Démocratique Gabonais (BDG), to the Parti Démocratique Gabonais (PDG). In the 1973 elections for the national assembly and the presidency, Bongo was the sole candidate for president. He and all PDG candidates were elected by 99.56% of the votes cast. In April 1975 Bongo abolished the post of vice-president and appointed his former vice-president, Léon Mébiame, as prime minister, a position Bongo had held concurrently with his presidency from 1967. Mebiame would remain as prime minister until his resignation in 1990.

In addition to the presidency, Bongo held several ministerial portfolios from 1967 onward, including Minister of Defence (1967–1981), Information (1967–1980), Planning (1967–1977), Prime Minister (1967–1975), the Interior (1967–1970), and many others. Following a Congress of the PDG in January 1979 and the December 1979 elections, Bongo gave up some of his ministerial portfolios and surrendered his functions as head of government to Prime Minister Mebiame. The PDG congress had criticized Bongo&#x27;s administration for inefficiency and called for an end to the holding of multiple offices. Bongo was again re-elected for a seven-year term in 1979, receiving 99.96% of the popular vote. In the autumn of that same year, Robert Luong, a lover of Bongo&#x27;s wife, was assassinated by &quot;barbouze&quot; mercenaries in Villeneuve-sur-Lot, France.
Opposition to President Bongo&#x27;s regime first appeared in the late 1970s, as economic difficulties became more acute for the Gabonese. The first organized, but illegal, opposition party was the Movement for National Restoration (&quot;Mouvement de redressement national&quot;, MORENA). This moderate opposition group sponsored demonstrations by students and academic staff at the Université Omar Bongo in Libreville in December 1981, when the university was temporarily closed. MORENA accused Bongo of corruption and personal extravagance and of favouring his own Bateke tribe; the group demanded that a multi-party system be restored. Arrests were made in February 1982, when the opposition distributed leaflets criticizing the Bongo regime during a visit by Pope John Paul II. In November 1982, 37 MORENA members were tried and convicted of offences against state security. Severe sentences were handed out, including 20 years of hard labour for 13 of the defendants; all were pardoned, however, and released by mid-1986.

Despite these pressures, Omar Bongo remained committed to one-party rule. In 1985, legislative elections were held which followed past procedures; all nominations were approved by PDG, which then presented a single list of candidates. The candidates were ratified by popular vote on 3 March 1985. In November 1986 Bongo was re-elected by 99.97% of the popular vote.

===Multi-party rule===
On 22 May 1990, after strikes, riots and unrest, the PDG central committee and the National Assembly approved constitutional amendments to facilitate the transition to a multi-party system. The existing presidential mandate, effective through 1994, was to be respected. Subsequent elections to the presidency would be contested by more than one candidate, and the presidential term of office was changed to five years with a term limit consisting of one re-election to the office.

The next day, 23 May 1990, a vocal critic of Bongo and the leading political opposition leader, , was found dead in a hotel, reportedly murdered by poison. The death of Rendjambe, a prominent business executive and secretary-general of the opposition group &quot;Parti gabonais du progres&quot; (PGP), touched off the worst rioting in Bongo&#x27;s 23-year rule. Presidential buildings in Libreville were set on fire and the French consul-general and ten oil company employees were taken hostage. French troops evacuated foreigners and a state of emergency was declared in Port Gentil, Rendjambe&#x27;s hometown and a strategic oil production site. During this emergency Gabon&#x27;s two main oil producers, Elf and Shell, cut output from to 20,000. Bongo threatened to withdraw their exploration licences unless they restored normal output, which they soon did. Under the moniker &quot;Opération Requin&quot;, France sent in 500 troops (1,200 according to other sources) to reinforce the 500-man battalion of Marines permanently stationed in Gabon &quot;to protect the interests of 20,000 resident French nationals&quot;. Tanks and troops were deployed around the presidential palace to halt rioters.

In December 1993, Bongo won the first presidential election held under the new multi-party constitution, by a considerably narrower margin of around 51.4%. Opposition candidates refused to validate the election results. Serious civil disturbances led to an agreement between the government and opposition factions to work toward a political settlement. These talks led to the Paris Accords in November 1994, under which several opposition figures were included in a government of national unity. This arrangement soon broke down, however, and the 1996 and 1997 legislative and municipal elections provided the backdrop for renewed partisan politics. The PDG won a landslide victory in the legislative election, but several major cities, including Libreville, elected opposition mayors during the 1997 local election. Bongo was eventually successful in consolidating power again, with most of the major opposition leaders being either co-opted by being given high-ranking posts in the government or bought off, ensuring his comfortable re-election in 1998.

In 2003, Bongo secured a change in the Constitution allowing him to seek re-election as many times as he wanted, and changing the Presidential term to seven years, up from five. Bongo&#x27;s critics accused him of intending to rule for life. On 27 November 2005 Bongo won a seven-year term as president, receiving 79.2 percent of the vote, comfortably ahead of his four challengers. He was sworn in for another seven-year term on 19 January 2006 and remained president until his death in 2009.

===Relations with France===
French culture, economy, and polity have long dominated the small African country of Gabon. The French control of the colonial era ... has been replaced, since independence in 1960, by an insidious rapprochement with Paris, fashioned by Gabon&#x27;s leadership. A French journalist long familiar with the continent wrote that &quot;Gabon is an extreme case, verging on caricature, of neocolonialism. Bongo&#x27;s international relations and affairs were dominated by his, and by extension Gabon&#x27;s, relations with France, Gabon falling within the ambit of the Françafrique. With its oil, a fifth of the world&#x27;s known uranium (Gabonese uranium supplied France&#x27;s nuclear bombs, which President Charles de Gaulle tested in the Algerian deserts in 1960), big iron and manganese deposits, and plenty of timber, Gabon was always important to France. Bongo reportedly said: &quot;Gabon without France is like a car with no driver. France without Gabon is like a car with no fuel...&quot; Relations between France and Gabon were mainly fostered through the informal networks of Jacques Foccart, the oil company Elf, the diplomat , the SDECE officer and the leader of the SAC militia .

In 1964 when renegade soldiers arrested him in Libreville and kidnapped president M&#x27;ba, French paratroopers rescued the abducted president and Bongo, restoring them to power. Bongo became Vice President in 1966 after what was effectively an interview and subsequent approval by de Gaulle in 1965 in Paris.

In 1988, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Last year, French aid to Gabon amounted to US$360 million. This included subsidizing a third of Gabon&#x27;s budget, extending low-interest trade loans, paying the salaries of 170 French advisers and 350 French teachers and paying scholarships for most of the roughly 800 Gabonese who study in France every year... [A]ccording to &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;, a French opposition weekly, US$2.6 million of this aid also went for the interior decoration of a DC-8 jet belonging to President Bongo.&quot;

In 1990, France, which has always maintained a permanent military base in Gabon as well as in some of its other ex-colonies, helped maintain Bongo in power in the face of sustained pro-democracy protests that threatened to oust him from power through its &quot;Opération Requin&quot;. When Gabon found itself on the brink of a civil war after the first multiparty presidential elections in 1993, with the opposition staging violent protests, Paris hosted the talks between Bongo and the opposition, resulting in the Paris Agreement/Accords which restored calm.In France, his old ally, Mr. Bongo and his family lived in the rarefied air of the super-rich. At their disposal were 39 luxurious properties, 70 bank accounts and at least 9 luxury vehicles worth about US$2 million, according to Transparency International... 
French president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing claimed that Bongo helped bankroll Jacques Chirac&#x27;s campaign in the 1981 presidential election. Giscard said Bongo had developed a &quot;very questionable financial network&quot; over time. &quot;I called Bongo and told him &#x27;you&#x27;re supporting my rival&#x27;s campaign&#x27; and there was a dead silence that I still remember to this day and then he said &#x27;Ah, you know about it&#x27;, which was extraordinary. From that moment on, I broke off personal relations with him&quot;, said Giscard. Socialist parliamentarian André Vallini reportedly claimed that Bongo had bankrolled numerous French electoral campaigns, on both the right and the left. In 2008, President Nicolas Sarkozy demoted his minister in charge of looking after the ex-colonies, Jean-Marie Bockel, after the latter noted the &quot;squandering of public funds&quot; by some African regimes, provoking Bongo&#x27;s fury.He made his country and his oil industry available as a source of offshore slush funds&quot;, said political analyst Nicholas Shaxson, the author of a book on Africa&#x27;s oil states. &quot;These were used by all the French political parties — from the left to the right — for secret party financing, and as a source of bribes in support of French commercial bids all over the world.
After Bongo&#x27;s demise, President Sarkozy expressed his &quot;sadness and emotion&quot; ... and pledged that France would remain &quot;loyal to its long relationship of friendship&quot; with Gabon. &quot;It is a great and loyal friend of France who has left us — a grand figure of Africa,&quot; Sarkozy said in a statement.

===Allegations of corruption===

Italian fashion designer Francesco Smalto admitted providing Bongo with Parisian prostitutes to secure a tailoring business worth $600,000 per year.

Bongo was one of the wealthiest heads of state in the world, his wealth attributed primarily to oil revenue and alleged corruption. In 1999, an investigation by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on investigations into Citibank estimated that the Gabonese President held US$130 million in the bank&#x27;s personal accounts, money the Senate report said was &quot;sourced in the public finances of Gabon&quot;.

In 2005, an investigation by the United States Senate Indian Affairs Committee into fundraising irregularities by lobbyist Jack Abramoff revealed that Abramoff had offered to arrange a meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush and Bongo for the sum of US$9,000,000. Although such an exchange of funds remains unproven, Bush met with Bongo 10 months later in the Oval Office.

In 2007, his former daughter-in-law, , the second wife of his son Ali Bongo, caused a stir when she appeared on the US music channel VH1&#x27;s reality show &quot;Really Rich Real Estate&quot;. She was featured trying to buy a US$25,000,000 mansion in Malibu, California.

Bongo was cited in recent years during French criminal inquiries into hundreds of millions of euros of illicit payments by Elf Aquitaine, the former French state-owned oil group. One Elf representative testified that the company was giving 50 million euros per year to Bongo to exploit the oil fields of Gabon. As of June 2007, Bongo, along with President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo, Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea and José Eduardo dos Santos from Angola was being investigated by the French magistrates after the complaint made by French NGOs Survie and Sherpa due to claims that he has used millions of pounds of embezzled public funds to acquire lavish properties in France. The leaders all denied wrongdoing.

The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; (UK) reported on 20 June 2008 as follows:A mansion worth £15m in one of Paris&#x27;s most elegant districts has become the latest of 33 luxury properties bought in France by President Omar Bongo Ondimba of Gabon ... a French judicial investigation has discovered that Bongo, 72, and his relatives also bought a fleet of limousines, including a £308,823 Maybach for his wife, Edith, 44. Payment for some of the cars was taken directly from the treasury of Gabon ... The Paris mansion is in the Rue de la Baume, near the Elysée Palace ... The home was bought in June last year by a property company based in Luxembourg. The firm&#x27;s partners are two of Bongo&#x27;s children, Omar, 13, and Yacine, 16, his wife Edith and one of her nephews... [T]he residence is the most expensive in his portfolio, which includes nine other properties in Paris, four of which are on the exclusive Avenue Foch, near the Arc de Triomphe. He also rents a nine-room apartment in the same street. Bongo has a further seven properties in Nice, including four villas, one of which has a swimming pool. Edith has two flats near the Eiffel Tower and another property in Nice. Investigators identified the properties through tax records. Checks at Bongo&#x27;s houses, in turn, allowed them to find details of his fleet of cars. Edith used a cheque, drawn on an account in the name of &quot;Prairie du Gabon en France&quot; (part of the Gabon treasury), to buy the Maybach, painted Côte d&#x27;Azur blue, in February 2004. Bongo&#x27;s daughter Pascaline, 52, used a cheque from the same account for a part-payment of £29,497 towards a £60,000 Mercedes two years later. Bongo bought himself a Ferrari 612 Scaglietti F1 in October 2004 for £153,000 while his son Ali acquired a Ferrari 456 M GT in June 2001 for £156,000. Bongo&#x27;s fortune has repeatedly come under the spotlight. According to a 1997 US Senate report, his family spends £55m a year. In a separate French investigation into corruption at the former oil giant Elf Aquitaine, an executive testified that it paid Bongo £40m a year via Swiss bank accounts in exchange for permission to exploit his country&#x27;s reserves. Bongo denied this. The latest inquiry, by the French antifraud agency OCRGDF, followed a lawsuit that accused Bongo and two other African leaders of looting public funds to finance their purchases. &#x27;Whatever the merits and qualifications of these leaders, no one can seriously believe that these assets were paid for out of their salaries&#x27;, alleges the lawsuit brought by the Sherpa association of judges, which promotes corporate social responsibility.
In 2009, Bongo spent his last months in a major row with France over the French inquiry. A French court decision in February 2009 to freeze his bank accounts added fuel to the fire and his government accused France of waging a &quot;campaign to destabilize&quot; the country.

In the aftermath of the 2007 complaint by Sherpa and Survie, parts of the Bongo family&#x27;s real estate and other assets have been seized in France through &quot;biens mal acquis&quot; rulings.

===Leadership style===
[W]ith a neat mustache and piercing gaze often hidden behind dark glasses, he ruled... He was a short man, like many of his minority Bateke ethnic group, and often wore raised platform shoes so as to appear taller... But his diminutive height belied his towering stature: on Gabon&#x27;s political stage – which he ruled shrewdly for nearly 42 years -; and on the African continent, as one of the last of the so-called &quot;big men&quot;.

Omar Bongo, Africa&#x27;s &quot;little Big Man&quot;, described as &quot;a diminutive, dapper figure who conversed in flawless French, a charismatic figure surrounded by a personality cult&quot;, was one of the last of the African &quot;Big Man&quot; rulers. The pillars of his long rule were France, revenues from Gabon&#x27;s of oil reserves, and his political skills.
An ardent Francophile, at the inception of his presidency Bongo was happy to strike a favourable bargain with the old colonial power, France. He gave the French oil company, Elf Aquitaine, privileged rights to exploit Gabon&#x27;s oil reserves while Paris returned the favour by guaranteeing his grip on power for the indefinite future.

Bongo went on to preside over an oil boom that undoubtedly fuelled an extravagant lifestyle for him and his family—dozens of luxurious properties in and around France, a US$800 million presidential palace in Gabon, fancy cars, etc. This enabled him to amass enough wealth to become one of the world&#x27;s richest men. He carefully allowed just enough oil money to trickle down to the general population of 1.4 million, thus avoiding mass unrest. He built some basic infrastructure in Libreville and, ignoring advice to establish a road network instead, constructed the US$4 billion Trans-Gabon Railway line deep into the forested interior. Petrodollars funded the salaries of a bloated civil service, spreading enough of the state&#x27;s wealth among the population to keep most of them fed and dressed. Gabon under Bongo was described in 2008 by the UK&#x27;s &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper:Gabon produces some sugar, beer and bottled water. Despite the rich soil and tropical climate, there is only a tiny amount of agricultural production. Fruit and vegetables arrive on trucks from Cameroon. Milk is flown in from France. And years of dependence on relatives with civil service jobs means that many Gabonese have no interest in seeking work outside the state sector – most manual jobs are taken by immigrants.
Bongo used part of the money to build up a fairly large circle of people who supported him such as government ministers, high administrators, and army officers. He had learned from M&#x27;ba how to give government ministries to different tribal groups so that someone from every important group had a representative in the government. Bongo had no ideology beyond self-interest, but there was no opposition with an ideology either. He ruled by knowing how the self-interest of others could be manipulated. He was skilled at persuading opposition figures to become his allies. He offered critics modest slices of the nation&#x27;s oil wealth, co-opting or buying off opponents rather than crushing them outright. He became the most successful of all Africa&#x27;s Francophone leaders, comfortably extending his political dominance into the fifth decade.

When multi-party presidential elections were held in 1993, which he won, the poll was marred by allegations of rigging, with the opposition claiming that chief rival, Father Paul Mba Abessole, was robbed of victory. Gabon found itself on the brink of a civil war, as the opposition staged violent demonstrations. Determined to prove that he was not a dictator who relied on brute force for his political survival, Bongo entered into talks with the opposition, negotiating what became known as the Paris Agreement. When Bongo won the second presidential elections held in 1998, similar controversy raged over his victory. The president responded by meeting some of his critics to discuss revising legislation to guarantee free and fair elections. After Bongo&#x27;s Gabonese Democratic Party scored a landslide victory in the 2001 legislative elections, Bongo offered government posts to influential opposition members. Father Abessole accepted a ministerial post in the name of &quot;friendly democracy&quot;.
The main opposition leader, Pierre Mamboundou of the Gabonese People&#x27;s Union, refused to attend the post 1998 elections meetings, claiming that they were merely a ploy by Bongo to lure opposition leaders. Mamboundou called for a boycott of the legislative elections held in December 2001, and his supporters burned ballot boxes and papers in a polling station in his hometown of Ndende. He then rejected offers for a senior post after the 2001 legislative elections. But despite threats from Bongo, Mamboundou was never arrested. The president declared that a &quot;policy of forgiveness&quot; was his &quot;best revenge&quot;. &quot;In 2006, however, Maboundou, stopped his public criticisms of Mr. Bongo. The former brand made no secret that the president pledged to give him US$21.5 million for the development of his constituency of Ndende&quot;. As time went on, Bongo depended on more and more on his close family members. By 2009, his son Ali by his first wife had been the Minister of Defence since 1999, while his daughter, Pascaline, was the head of the president&#x27;s administration and her husband the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paul Toungui.

In 2000, he put an end to a student strike by providing about US$1.35 million for the purchase of the computers and books they were demanding. &quot;[He] was a self-proclaimed nature lover in a country with the largest percentage of the untrammelled virgin jungle of all the nations in the Congo Basin. In 2002, he set aside 10 percent of Gabon&#x27;s land as national parks, pledging that they would never be logged, mined, hunted or farmed.&quot; He was not beyond some measure of self-aggrandisement, &quot;thus, Gabon acquired Bongo University, Bongo Airport, numerous Bongo Hospitals, Bongo Stadium and Bongo Gymnasium. The president&#x27;s hometown, Lewai, was inevitably renamed Bongoville.&quot;

On the international stage, Bongo cultivated an image as a mediator, playing a pivotal role in attempts to solve the crises in the Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 1986, Bongo&#x27;s image was boosted abroad when he received the Dag Hammarskjöld Peace Prize for efforts to resolve the Chad-Libya border conflict. He was popular among his own people as his reign had guaranteed peace and stability. Under Mr. Bongo&#x27;s rule, Gabon never had a coup or a civil war, a rare achievement for a nation surrounded by unstable, war-torn states. Fuelled by oil, the country&#x27;s economy was more like that of an Arabian emirate than a Central African nation. For many years Gabon was said, perhaps apocryphally, to have the world&#x27;s highest per capita consumption of Champagne.

According to the political scientist Thomas Atenga, despite the large oil revenues, &quot;the Gabonese rentier state has functioned for years on the predation of resources for the benefit of its ruling class, around which a parasitic capitalism has developed that has hardly improved the living conditions of the population&quot;.

==Illness and death==
On 7 May 2009, the Gabonese Government announced that Bongo had temporarily suspended his official duties and taken time off to mourn his wife and rest in Spain.

International media, however, reported that he was seriously ill, and undergoing treatment for cancer in hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The Gabonese government maintained that he was in Spain for a few days of rest following the &quot;intense emotional shock&quot; of his wife&#x27;s death, but eventually admitted that he was in a Spanish clinic &quot;undergoing a medical check-up&quot;.

On 7 June 2009, unconfirmed reports quoting French media and citing sources &quot;close to the French government&quot; reported that Bongo had died in Spain of complications from advanced cancer. The Government of Gabon denied the reports, which had been picked up by numerous other news sources, and continued to insist that he was well. His death was eventually confirmed by Gabonese Prime Minister Jean Eyeghe Ndong, who said in a written statement that Bongo had died of a heart attack shortly before 12:30 GMT on 8 June 2009.

Bongo&#x27;s body was flown back to Gabon, where it lay in state for five days, as thousands of people came to pay their respects. A state funeral followed on 16 June 2009 in Libreville which was attended by nearly two dozen African heads of state, including several of the continent&#x27;s strongmen who themselves had ruled for decades, and by the French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his predecessor Jacques Chirac, who were the only Western heads of state to attend.

Bongo&#x27;s body was then flown to Franceville, the main town in the southeastern province of Haut-Ogooue, where he was born, where he was buried in a private family burial on 18 June 2009.

==Personal life==

Bongo converted to Islam and took the name Omar while on a visit to Libya in 1973. At the time Muslims constituted a tiny minority of the native population; following Bongo&#x27;s conversion the numbers grew, although they remained a small minority. He added Ondimba as a surname on 15 November 2003 in recognition of his father, Basile Ondimba, who died in 1942.

Bongo&#x27;s first marriage was to Louise Mouyabi-Moukala. They had a daughter, Pascaline Bongo Ondimba, born at Franceville in 1957. Pascaline was Gabon&#x27;s Foreign Minister and subsequently Director of the Presidential Cabinet.

Bongo&#x27;s second marriage was to Marie Joséphine Kama, later known as Joséphine Bongo. He divorced her in 1987, after which she went on to launch a music career under a new name, Patience Dabany. They had a son, Alain Bernard Bongo, and a daughter, Albertine Amissa Bongo. Born at Brazzaville in 1959, Alain Bernard Bongo (later known as Ali-Ben Bongo) served as foreign minister from 1989 to 1992, then as defence minister from 1999 to 2009, and was then elected president in August 2009 to replace his father.

Bongo then married Edith Lucie Sassou-Nguesso, nearly 30 years his junior, in 1989. She was the daughter of Congolese President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. She was a trained pediatrician, known for her commitment to fighting AIDS. She bore Bongo two children. Edith Lucie Bongo died on 14 March 2009, four days after her 45th birthday in Rabat, Morocco, where she had been undergoing treatment for several months. The statement announcing her death did not specify the cause of death or the nature of her illness. She had not appeared in public for around three years preceding her death. She was buried on 22 March 2009 in the family cemetery in the northern town of Edou, in her native Congo.

In all, Bongo had more than 30 children with his wives and other women.

Bongo did also have some measure of scandal. In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that:
Peru is investigating claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon to become the lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said he was unaware of the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo&#x27;s presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, &quot;he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed.&quot; She said, &quot;I told him I was not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru.&quot; She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women&#x27;s groups and others intervened.

==In popular culture==

Bongo was referenced in Robert Altman&#x27;s 1983 offbeat comedy &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot; - in which the irreverent title characters, who admire Bongo, phone the seemingly amused Gabonese leader to recount their &quot;utterly monstrous, mind-roasting summer.&quot;

<text>Yahya Abdul-Aziz Jemus Junkung Jammeh (born 25 May 1965) is a Gambian politician and former soldier, who served as President of the Gambia from 1996 to 2017. He was the Chairman of the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) from 1994 to 1996.

Jammeh was born in Kanilai, in West Coast Region of the Gambia, and is a Muslim of the Jola ethnic group. He attended Gambia High School in Banjul from 1978 to 1983 and served in the Gambian National Gendarmerie from 1984 to 1989. He was then commissioned as an officer of the Gambian National Army, commanding the Military Police from 1992 to 1994. In July 1994, he came to power by leading a bloodless coup d&#x27;etat that overthrew the elected government of Sir Dawda Jawara. At first ruling by decree, he was elected president in the 1996 election. Jammeh was re-elected as president in 2001, 2006 and 2011, but lost to Adama Barrow in 2016.

His presidency oversaw a shift towards authoritarianism, demonstrated in particular by his policies towards anti-government journalists, LGBT+ people and opposition parties. His foreign policy led to constant difficulties with the country&#x27;s sole neighbour, Senegal. In 2013, Jammeh withdrew the Gambia from the Commonwealth of Nations and in 2016 he began the process of withdrawing the country from the International Criminal Court, one year after he declared the nation an Islamic republic. All three decisions were later rescinded by successor government, despite Jammeh&#x27;s supporters arguing that his foreign policy encouraged self-sufficiency and anti-colonialism.

Jammeh has been implicated in serious human rights violations, such as murder, rape and torture, as highlighted in the final report of the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission. He is now living in exile in Equatorial Guinea. His assets around the world have been frozen by many countries amidst additional accusations of stealing millions of dollars from his country to fund a life of luxury. Jammeh has denied the allegations against him and has not been formally charged.

== Early life and military service ==
Jammeh was born on 25 May 1965 in Kanilai, a village in the Foni Kansala district of the Western Division of the Gambia. He is the son of Aja Fatou Ashombi Bojang, a housewife and trader, and Abdul Aziz James Junkung Jammeh, a career wrestler. Jammeh&#x27;s grandparents migrated to the Gambia from the Casamance region of Senegal. He had a rural upbringing as part of a Muslim Jola family, primarily focused in Kanilai. One of his closest childhood friends was reportedly Mustapha James Kujabi. He attended Kanilai primary school, Saint Edwards primary school in Bwiam, from 1972 to 1978. After passing the common entrance (CE) exam, he was awarded a government scholarship to Gambia High School in Banjul, in 1978. His formal education ended after he was successful in his O Levels in 1983.

In April 1984, Jammeh joined what was then the Gambian National Gendarmerie as a private. He was part of the Special Intervention Unit from 1984 to 1986 and was an escort training instructor at the Gendarmerie Training School from 1986 to 1989. He was promoted to sergeant in April 1986, and to cadet officer in December 1987. A former Gendarmerie officer, Binneh S. Minteh, later claimed that Jammeh &quot;had always singled out Mandinkas as bad people&quot; during his time as a Gendarme. In particular, Minteh recalled Jammeh&#x27;s &quot;ruthless and disrespectful encounter&quot; with sergeant major Kebba Dibba, and when he &quot;brandished a pistol and threatened to shoot&quot; a captain named Ebrima Camara simply on the basis of his ethnicity.

He joined the Gambian National Army and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 29 September 1989, serving as the officer in charge (OIC) of the Presidential Escort, part of the Presidential Guards, from 1989 to 1990. In 1991, he served as the officer commanding (OC) the Mobile Gendarmerie, and from 1992 to 1994 was the OC of the Gambia National Army Military Police. On 1 February 1992, he had been promoted to lieutenant. Jammeh was the head of security detail attached to Pope John Paul II during his visit to the Gambia in February 1992. He attended the Military Police Officers Basic Course (MPOBC) at Fort McClellan in the United States from September 1993 to January 1994.

== 1994 coup d&#x27;etat and military rule ==

=== 1994 coup d&#x27;etat ===
Jammeh was one of the four junior Army officers who organised the 1994 coup d&#x27;etat against Sir Dawda Jawara&#x27;s government. The other three were &quot;Sana Sabally&quot;, &quot;Sadibou Hydara&quot; and Edward Singateh. The coup, which took place on 22 July 1994, was successful and bloodless, leading to Jawara fleeing into exile. Four days later, on 26 July, the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) was formed with Jammeh as its chairman. Jammeh promised that it would be a &quot;coup with a difference&quot;, and that the country would be returned to civilian rule &quot;as soon as we have set things right&quot;. One result of the coup was that the European Union and the United States, the major donors of foreign aid to the Gambia, suspended their aid programmes until the country was returned to civil rule. Jammeh claimed the suspension of aid programmes amounted to &quot;neocolonialism&quot;. A Western diplomat who spoke to &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;This is exactly the same phenomenon we have seen elsewhere, with the only difference being that so far there has been no violence.&quot; In particular, the coup was compared with Samuel Doe&#x27;s in the Liberia, which led to the First Liberian Civil War.

The 1994 &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; in the Gambia, overthrowing the government of Sir Dawda Jawara, represented a reversal in the general trend in sub-Saharan Africa after 1989 away from authoritarianism and towards multiparty politics. The Gambia had previously represented an anomaly in Africa as one of the few countries that had a functioning democracy prior to 1989.

=== Rule through the AFPRC ===
In the aftermath of the coup, Jammeh governed by decree alongside four other junior officers and several civilians. He banned all political activity, arrested two socialist journalists, and detained several of his Army superiors. He also confined ministers of Jawara&#x27;s government under house arrest. On 17 October, Jammeh announced that there would be a four-year transition to civilian government. In November 1994, the same month when Jammeh was formally promoted to the rank of captain, there was an unsuccessful coup attempt by several disaffected young officers leading to numerous deaths, but Jammeh remained in power. The National Consultative Committee (NCC) was appointed on 7 December to review the transition process, and when they reported on 27 January 1995, they recommended a two-year transition period. The same day as the NCC&#x27;s report, two of the original coup leaders, Sabally and Hydara, launched an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow Jammeh as chairman. Subsequently, Edward Singateh was appointed as vice-chairman of the AFPRC, and Hydara died in prison on 3 June.

The Constitutional Review Commission (CRC) was appointed in April 1995 and reported to the government in November 1995. Its report was published in March 1996 was put to a national referendum on 8 August 1996. The new constitution, which provided for multiparty elections, an unlimited number of five-year presidential terms, and a lowering of the voting age from 21 to 18, was approved by a majority of 70%. According to Gambian American author Abdoulaye Saine, Jammeh would &quot;[enjoy] unrivalled political and economic power as a consequence of the new constitution. In contrast, opposition political parties [would be] sidelined and allowed little political space in a one-sided electoral contest in which Jammeh was the assured ‘winner’.&quot; Decree no. 89, issued on 14 August, reiterated the ban on the PPP, the NCP and the GPP, but lifted the ban on the PDOIS and the PDP. In 1996, on 28 August, Jammeh was formally promoted to the rank of colonel and then retired from the army on 6 September, one month before the 1996 presidential election.

== President of the Gambia ==
=== 1996 and 1997 elections ===

Jammeh won the 1996 presidential election as the APRC candidate, winning 56% of the vote and beating Ousainou Darboe, Hamat Bah and Sidia Jatta. Darboe was forced to seek refuge in the Senegalese embassy in Banjul, fearing an assassination plot. In the 1997 parliamentary election, the first to the new National Assembly put in place by the 1996 constitution, the APRC won a majority of seats. However, these two elections, the first following the transition from military to civil rule, were &quot;marred by provisions of the new, doctored constitution, an electoral commission appointed by Jammeh alone in 1995 and a political network that included the Green Boys – a now-disbanded vigilante group that was mobilised to intimidate the electorate to ensure Jammeh’s ‘victory’.&quot; Saine argues that this combination of intimidation and harassment of the opposition, an inherent bias provided by the 1996 constitution, as well as a distinct financial advantage, meant that &quot;the presidential and national assembly elections were lost long before the first ballot was cast.&quot;

=== Elections ===

Jammeh founded the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction as his political party. He was elected as president in September 1996. Foreign observers did not deem these elections free and fair. He was re-elected on 18 October 2001 with about 53% of the vote; this election was generally deemed free and fair by observers, despite some very serious shortcomings ranging from overt government intimidation of voters to technical innovations (such as raising the required deposit to stand for election by a factor of 25) to distort the process in favour of the incumbent regime.

A coup attempt against Jammeh was reported to have been thwarted on 21 March 2006; Jammeh, who was in Mauritania at the time, quickly returned home. Army chief of staff Col. Ndure Cham, the alleged leader of the plot, reportedly fled to neighbouring Senegal, while other alleged conspirators were arrested and were put on trial for treason. In April 2007, ten former officers accused of involvement were convicted and given prison sentences; four of them were sentenced to life in prison.

Jammeh ran for a third term in the presidential election held on 22 September 2006; the election was initially planned for October but was moved forward because of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. He was re-elected with 67.3% of the vote and was declared the winner of the election; the opposition candidate Ousainou Darboe finished second, as in 2001.

In November 2011, Jammeh was again re-elected as president for a fourth term in office, reportedly having received 72% of the popular vote.

=== Domestic policy ===

==== Suppression of the press ====

One of Jammeh&#x27;s consistent targets throughout his time as President was the press and the media, as a whole as well as individual journalists. In 1998, the independent Citizen FM radio station was forced to close after a number of its staff were arrested and its equipment was confiscated. After its American proprietor sold it to a businessman with close ties to Jammeh in 1999, &quot;The Daily Observer&quot; became notably pro-Jammeh. In August 2000, the anti-government Radio 1 FM suffered an arson attack. Abdoulaye Saine states that Jammeh was able to use Gambia Radio &amp; Television Service as his personal propaganda outlet whenever he required.

Jammeh had made a number of public statements against the press. In July 2000, he said that &quot;anybody bent on disturbing the peace and stability of the nation [should] be buried six feet deep.&quot; In April 2004, Jammeh told journalists to obey his government &quot;or go to hell&quot;. In June 2005, he said that he had allowed &quot;too much freedom of expression&quot; in the Gambia.

In response to his suppression of the press and media in the Gambia, various online newspapers and radio stations were established by self-exiled Gambian journalists to publicise alleged government atrocities. These include &quot;Freedom Newspaper&quot;, &quot;The Gambia Echo&quot; and &quot;Gainako&quot;.

Jammeh also saw through legislation to restrict the activities of the press. The Newspaper Act 1994 imposed criminal penalties on private publications that failed to pay a yearly registration fee. The National Media Communication Act 2000 forced journalists to reveal confidential sources to police and the judiciary on demand. In December 2004, the Criminal Code (Amendment) Bill 2004 allowed prison terms for defamation and sedition. The same month, the Newspaper (Amendment) Bill 2004 required newspaper proprietors to purchase expensive operating licenses and forcing them to register their homes as security.

A number of individual journalists were also targeted. In December 2004, Deyda Hydara, then editor of &quot;The Point&quot;, announced his intention to publicly challenge newly-introduced legislation restricting press freedoms. He was shot and killed when driving home in Banjul on 16 December, leading to thousands protesting on the streets. Some pointed at the government, led by Jammeh, as the murderers, but it has remained unsolved. Furthermore, in July 2006, Ebrima Manneh of &quot;The Daily Observer&quot; was arrested by state security after attempting to publish a BBC report critical of Jammeh. His arrest was witnessed by his coworkers, and, despite being ordered to release Manneh by an ECOWAS court, the government denied that Manneh was still imprisoned. An unnamed police source said that he believed Manneh &quot;is no longer alive&quot;. Both Amnesty International and the Committee to Protect Journalists have called for his release.

==== Women&#x27;s rights ====
In 1999, Jammeh called those who campaigned against female genital mutilation (FGM) &quot;enemies of Islam&quot;. In December 2015, Jammeh banned FGM in the Gambia, labelling the practice as having &quot;no place in Islam or in modern society&quot;; anyone that ignored the ban would face a prison sentence of up to three years. After the end of Ramadan and Eid ul-Fitr in July 2016, Jammeh further announced a ban on child marriages. In 2016, some 30% of women were married while under the age of 18. Yahya Jammeh&#x27;s response was that anyone caught marrying a girl under 18 years of age would be jailed for up to twenty years.

==== Judiciary ====
As President, Jammeh had significant influence over the judiciary in the Gambia, particularly because Section 98 of the 1996 constitution permits the President to appoint judges directly. Saine argues that Jammeh&#x27;s employment of judges mainly from other Commonwealth countries allowed him to effectively issue tough sentences to reduce dissent and to imprison both real and perceived threats to the president&#x27;s power.

==== LGBT rights ====
On 15 May 2008, Jammeh announced that his government would introduce legislation that would set laws against homosexuals that would be &quot;stricter than those in Iran&quot;, and that he would &quot;cut off the head&quot; of any gay or lesbian person discovered in the country. News reports indicated his government intended to execute all homosexuals in the country. In a speech given in Tallinding, Jammeh gave a &quot;final ultimatum&quot; to any gays or lesbians in the Gambia, warning them to leave the country. In a speech to the United Nations on 27 September 2013, Jammeh said &quot;[h]omosexuality in all its forms and manifestations which, though very evil, antihuman as well as anti-Allah, is being promoted as a human right by some powers,&quot; who &quot;want to put an end to human existence.&quot; On 18 February 2014, Jammeh called homosexuals &quot;vermins&quot; by saying that: &quot;We will fight these called &quot;homosexuals&quot; or &quot;gays&quot; the same way we are fighting malaria-causing mosquitoes, if not more aggressively&quot;. He also went on to disparage the LGBT by saying that &quot;As far as I am concerned, LGBT can only stand for Leprosy, Gonorrhoea, Bacteria and Tuberculosis, all of which are detrimental to human existence&quot;.

In May 2015, in defiance of Western criticism, Jammeh intensified his anti-gay rhetoric, telling a crowd during an agricultural tour: &quot;If you do it [in the Gambia] I will slit your throat – if you are a man and want to marry another man in this country and we catch you, no one will ever set eyes on you again, and no white person can do anything about it.&quot;

This prompted a fresh round of condemnation from international human rights leaders. US National Security Advisor Susan Rice released a statement of condemnation on 16 May 2015: &quot;We condemn his comments, and note these threats come amid an alarming deterioration of the broader human rights situation in the Gambia&quot;, said Rice. &quot;We are deeply concerned about credible reports of torture, suspicious disappearances – including of two American citizens – and arbitrary detention at the government&#x27;s hands&quot;.

==== HIV/AIDS policy ====
In January 2007, Jammeh claimed he could cure HIV/AIDS and asthma with natural herbs. His claimed treatment program includes instructing patients to cease taking their anti-retroviral drugs. His claims have been criticised for promoting unscientific treatment that could have dangerous results, including the infection of others by those who thought they had been cured by the method. In December 2011, he restated during an interview that the alleged cure for HIV/AIDS was &quot;going very well&quot;.

Fadzai Gwaradzimba, the country representative of the United Nations Development Programme in the Gambia, was told to leave the country after she expressed doubts about the claims and said the remedy might encourage risky behaviour. In August 2007, Jammeh claimed to have developed a single dose herbal infusion that could treat high blood pressure. Jammeh has also claimed to develop a treatment for infertility in women as part of what is called the President&#x27;s Alternative Treatment Program (PATP).

=== Foreign policy ===

==== Senegal ====

August and October 2005 saw a border feud with Senegal over increased ferry prices for crossings over the Gambia River. Jammeh has a close relationship with Jolas in the Casamance region of Senegal, who allowed him to &quot;rule with impunity&quot;. In turn, Jammeh supported the rebels in the Casamance conflict, by engaging in the trade of illegal drugs, small arms, and also money-laundering with the rebel groups.

==== Mediation and peacekeeping role ====

Shortly after the outbreak of the Guinea-Bissau Civil War in June 1998, Jammeh sought a peaceful resolution to the conflict. He personally canvassed regional opinion on the war in Cape Verde, Mauritania, Guinea and Senegal. He also sent Momodou Lamin Sedat Jobe, his foreign minister, to meet with rebel leader Ansumane Mané to attempt to arrange peace talks in Banjul, though these efforts were fruitless.

According to &quot;The Daily Observer&quot;, on 10 December 2012, Jammeh secured the release of Senegalese soldiers who had been held as hostages by rebels. He sent a delegation to meet with Senegalese president Macky Sall in early December 2012. The delegation&#x27;s goal was to discuss a resolution to the ongoing civil unrest in Senegal&#x27;s southern region of Casamance. Members of the delegation included the Minister of Presidential Affairs, the US ambassador to the Gambia, and members from the Red Cross and Red Crescent.

The Jammeh Foundation for Peace (JFP) was created by Jammeh to help eradicate poverty among Gambians, improve agricultural production, and sponsor educational opportunities for needy students. The foundation has a hospital that is sponsored by the president and provides medical services to the general public.

Donations in 2012 included $2,563,138 to the National Youths Conference and Festival, and &quot;two truckloads of turkey&quot; to the Gambia Christian Council for delivery to the Christian community. Jammeh also bankrolled university education for the less privileged both in the Gambia and abroad.

==== Taiwan ====

Taiwan was once the &quot;financial lifeline&quot; for Jammeh&#x27;s regime, providing financial support as part of its campaign for international recognition at the United Nations. Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou visited the Gambia during Jammeh&#x27;s presidency. However, Jammeh later cut ties with Taiwan.

=== Human rights abuses ===

==== 2000 shooting of students ====

On 10 and 11 April 2000, the government was accused of the killing of 14 students and a journalist during a student demonstration to protest the death of a student in the Gambia. Jammeh was accused of ordering the shooting of the students, but the government denied the allegations. A government commission of inquiry reportedly concluded that the Police Intervention Unit (PIU) officers were &quot;largely responsible&quot; for many of the deaths and other injuries. The commission also said that five soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Battalion were responsible for the deaths of two students at Brikama. The government stated that the report implicated several PIU officers in the students&#x27; deaths and injuries, but those responsible were not prosecuted.

==== 2005 killing of West African migrants ====

Testimony to the Gambia&#x27;s Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) between 2019 and 2021 implicated Gambian military officials and the Junglers, a paramilitary unit commanded by Jammeh, in the 2005 killings of 50–60 West African migrants, mostly Ghanians, destined for Europe. This corroborates 2018 findings by Human Rights Watch and TRIAL International on the same incident, but contradicts an unpublished UN/ECOWAS report that attributed the killings to rogue security personnel.

According to defence and National Intelligence Agency officials who testified to TRRC, these migrants were detained in the town of Barra on 22 July 2005, and then tortured in various detention centers around Banjul. The bodies of eight of the migrants were found near Ghana Town the following day, while two people escaped but disappeared on 24 July. The 40–45 survivors were summarily executed in Senegal, across the southern border from Jammeh&#x27;s hometown of Kanilai, except for one survivor. Ex-Junglers who testified attributed the execution orders to Jammeh himself. The Jammeh administration proceeded to cover up the incident from Ghana and ECOWAS.

==== 2009 witch hunting campaign ====
In March 2009 Amnesty International reported that up to 1,000 Gambians had been abducted by government-sponsored &quot;witch doctors&quot; on charges of witchcraft, and taken to government detention centres where they were forced to drink dirty water with poisonous herbs; this left several captives with sequelae. On 21 May 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the alleged witch-hunting campaign had been sparked by the President Yahya Jammeh, who believed that the death of his aunt earlier that year could be attributed to witchcraft. These crimes were influenced by Bissauguinean president João Bernardo Vieira&#x27;s assassination on 2 March 2009.

==== Disappearances and imprisonments ====

Newspaper reports list dozens of individuals who have disappeared after being picked up by men in plain-clothes, and others who have languished under indefinite detention for months or years without charge or trial. The regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court ordered the Gambian government to produce one journalist who had disappeared. In April 2016, at least 50 people were arrested during a demonstration, and there were fears that Solo Sandeng, an opposition politician, died alongside two others while being held in detention. In July 2016, a Gambian opposition leader and another 18 people were sentenced to three years in jail for participation in the April demonstration. A Gambian diplomat publicly denied that Sandeng had died in custody.

===2014 coup attempt===

On 30 December 2014, gunmen attacked the State House of the Gambia, the official presidential residence. Local media quickly identified them as having entered the country from neighbouring Senegal under the command of Lt Col. Lamin Sanneh. Yahya Jammeh ran away and was out of the country, with sources differing on whether he was in France or Dubai.

However, with the gunmen failing to consolidate control, the coup failed. Jammeh returned to Gambia the following day.

=== 2016 election, crisis and ECOWAS intervention ===

Ahead of the 2016 presidential election a number of opposition members, including United Democratic Party leader Ousainou Darboe, were sentenced to three years in jail for staging pro-democracy protests. In a public address, Jammeh called members of the opposition &quot;opportunistic people supported by the West,&quot; adding that &quot;I will bow to only Allah and my mother. I will never tolerate opposition to destabilize this country.&quot; The election itself took place on 1 December 2016 and, in a surprise result, Jammeh was defeated by Adama Barrow leading a coalition of opposition parties. At first, Jammeh stated that he would not contest the result.

Although Jammeh initially conceded defeat, on 9 December 2016 he rejected the result citing &quot;unacceptable abnormalities&quot;. He subsequently announced that he had annulled the result, pending a new vote. He then filed a petition with the Supreme Court of the Gambia to contest the result. The court began hearing the case on 21 December. ECOWAS warned on 23 December that it would militarily intervene to uphold the results of the election if Jammeh didn&#x27;t resign by 19 January. Jammeh appointed six new judges to the Supreme Court, having sacked all but one in 2015. The hearing was to be heard on 10 January, but was delayed until May. Jammeh stated that he would only relinquish the presidency if the court upheld the election result.

The African Union additionally stated that it would stop recognising Jammeh as president as of 19 January 2017. He attempted to have Barrow&#x27;s inauguration blocked, but the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court refused to rule on the matter. On Tuesday 17 January, he declared a 90-day state of emergency, prohibiting &quot;acts of disobedience&quot; and &quot;acts intended to disturb public order&quot;. Various ministers resigned, and about 46,000 civilians (about 75% of whom were children) fled the country. Senegal, which was selected by ECOWAS to lead the operation to remove Jammeh from his post, moved its troops closer to the border with the Gambia on 18 January. Jammeh was warned to step down by midnight. Jammeh refused to step down and the deadline passed. On 18 January, parliament voted to extend Jammeh&#x27;s term by three months, while in parallel, Adama Barrow was internationally recognised as president. On 19 January, Senegalese troops entered the Gambia. The United Nations Security Council approved a resolution backing Barrow while calling on Jammeh to step down. It backed ECOWAS&#x27; efforts to ensure that the results of the 2016 presidential election were respected by using political means first. Senegal halted its offensive, to allow mediation of the crisis one final time, with the invasion to proceed at noon on 20 January if Jammeh were to refuse to relinquish power. Jammeh again refused to step down and missed two deadlines on 20 January while regional leaders tried to persuade him to step down.

During the early hours of 21 January, Jammeh announced on state television that he was stepping down from the post of president, and left the country later on the same day, travelling to Guinea and then Equatorial Guinea.

=== Sexual abuse and rape allegations ===

Three women from Gambia accused the former president, Yahya Jammeh, of raping and sexually abusing them while still in office, as per rights advocacy group Human Rights Watch and TRIAL International. According to ex-Gambian officials, women were pressured by presidential aides regularly to visit and work for Jammeh. One of the women is a Gambian pageant winner who has accused the ex-president of raping her. The victim, Fatou &quot;Toufah&quot; Jallow said she met Jammeh when she was 18 years old after winning a beauty pageant in 2014.

As per Jallow, in the months that followed, Jammeh asked her to marry him at a dinner organized by one of his aides. Later, Fatou was invited by the former president via his aide to attend a religious ceremony at the State House. However, on her arrival the victim claims to have been taken to the president&#x27;s private residence, where she was injected with a needle and &quot;sodomized&quot;. In October 2019, Jallow testified before Gambia’s public Truth and Reconciliation Commission about the rape charges.

=== Terror ===
In 2018 the American treasury that designated Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi as a terrorist and one of Hezbollah financier, linked him to Jammeh. Since 1997 Hezbollah is designated by the US as a terrorist organization, a fact that did not prevent him from doing business with the millitant group and to provide protection to its financiers.

== Exile ==

As Jammeh left the Gambia on 21 January 2017, Barrow stated that a &quot;truth and reconciliation commission&quot; would be appointed to investigate any possible crimes committed by Jammeh. Barrow cautioned that the commission would not prosecute Jammeh, only investigate the alleged crimes. West African leaders did not guarantee any form of immunity to Jammeh. The United Nations, African Union and ECOWAS declared that any country offering refuge to him or his family would not be punished and he should be free to return to the country in the future. The statement added that it would work with the government of the Gambia to make sure that assets and properties legally belonging to him or his family, cabinet members, government officials or party supporters would not be seized. Jammeh later left the Gambia for Equatorial Guinea, where he allegedly lives in a mansion in the village of Mongomo.

After Jammeh went into exile, Adama Barrow&#x27;s special adviser Mai Ahmad Fatty alleged that in late January 2017, Jammeh had stolen million from the state&#x27;s treasury and used a cargo plane to ship out his luxury vehicles during his last week in power. He added that the state&#x27;s treasury was virtually empty, which was confirmed by technicians in the Ministry of Finance as well as the Central Bank of the Gambia. About a month later, two senior ministers alleged that he had siphoned at least $50 million from social security, ports, and the national telecoms company. They also alleged that his private jet, which cost $4.5 million, was bought using the state&#x27;s pension fund. The government stated that his actions had left the country with a debt of more than $1 billion. Reuters released a report regarding Jammeh&#x27;s charity on 24 February 2017 in which it stated that funds from the Jammeh Foundation for Peace went to Jammeh himself, not to the foundation&#x27;s projects. The Minister of Justice announced on 10 March that the government would launch an investigation into his finances including his personal use of a charity bank account.

A Gambian court froze Jammeh&#x27;s known remaining assets in the Gambia in May 2017 after it emerged he had siphoned off $50 million (~$ in ) of public money through the state-owned telecommunications company Gamtel to his own bank accounts during his presidency.

Effective 21 December 2017, US President Donald Trump issued an executive order under the Magnitsky Act that specifically named Yahya Jammeh among the persons whose US-based assets are to be blocked.

There also been some controversy in the Gambia over the revelation that Jammeh during his time in office allowed a Franco-Polish arms dealer Pierre Dadak to use jetliners belonging to the Gambian state to fly around Europe and Africa to conduct his business. Jammeh&#x27;s private secretary Njogu Bah, who was present at the Jammeh-Dadak meetings, has refused interview requests from the Gambian media to explain why Dadak was allowed to use Gambian jets. In June 2018, the Gambian government decided to auction off his fleet of luxury cars and aircraft to raise money for health and education projects. On 27 July 2018, Jammeh&#x27;s mother died in exile.

He was photographed in May 2019 accompanied by Teodoro Obiang Nguema himself, Jammeh had grown his beard, the matches of the Equatoguinean opposition denounced the presence of this &quot;annoying guest&quot; claiming that &quot;they do not want another dictator in the country&quot;.

On 12 January 2020, Jammeh was warned by Gambian officials not to return to the Gambia without permission, as his safety could not be guaranteed.

In August 2021, Adama Barrow sold one of Yahya Jammeh&#x27;s presidential aircraft to a company in Belarus.

Exiled Jammeh endorsed his former rival Mama Kandeh in the 2021 Gambian presidential election.

In May 2022, the Government of Gambia has accepted the recommendation to prosecute the exiled former president for killings and other crimes committed during his tenure of office. His $3.5m mansion in Potomac, Maryland was seized by the US Justice Department.

On December 15, 2024, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) approved, at a summit of heads of state, the creation of a special tribunal to try crimes committed during the presidency of Yahya Jammeh between 1994 and 2017. 

Yahya Jammeh, a former Gambian president who has been residing in exile in Equatorial Guinea since January 2017, has lately declared his desire to return to The Gambia. He vowed in a speech that he intended to return and that no one could stop him. 

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===
Jammeh is an ethnic Jola. He briefly dated Tuti Faal, of Mauritanian descent, in 1994 before marrying her. She worked for the Gambia Telecommunication Company (GAMTEL) until the coup in July 1994. They had difficulty conceiving a child, and in 1998 Jammeh sent her to Saudi Arabia for a gynaecological exam, and during her time abroad, divorced her. Jammeh married his second wife Zeinab (Zineb) Suma Jammeh, on 26 March 1999. They have two children as of 2007, a daughter, Mariam Jammeh, and a son, Muhammed Yahya Jammeh. The latter was born in late 2007, when his daughter was eight years old.

On 30 September 2010, Jammeh announced his marriage to a 21-year-old (or possibly 18-year-old) additional wife by the name Alima Sallah, daughter of Omar Gibril Sallah, Gambia&#x27;s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, and Zahra Sallah. It was announced that his new wife would officially be referred to as Lady Alima Yahya Jammeh, and would not be referred to as a &quot;first lady&quot;, since Zeinab Suma Jammeh was the official &quot;first lady&quot;.

According to at least one source, his marriage to Sallah was a shock to his other wife Zeinab Suma Jammeh, and the additional marriage led to strains in their relationship and even plans for their divorce. Zeinab Jammeh had reportedly already been living in the US separately from her husband for some time. Sallah reportedly also left Gambia for the US in June 2010. According to the same publication, he then divorced Sallah in early 2011.

=== Religion ===
Jammeh, like the majority of Gambians, practises Islam. In July 2010, Jammeh stressed that people should believe in God: &quot;If you don&#x27;t believe in God, you can never be grateful to humanity and you are even below a pig.&quot; In 2011 he told the BBC, &quot;I will deliver to the Gambian people and if I have to rule this country for one billion years, I will, if Allah says so.&quot; On 12 December 2015, Jammeh declared the Muslim-majority country to be an Islamic republic, saying the move marked a break with the Gambia&#x27;s colonial past. Jammeh told state television that the proclamation was in line with Gambia&#x27;s &quot;religious identity and values&quot;. He added that no dress code would be imposed and citizens of other faiths would be allowed to practise freely.

== Titles and styles ==
The official title used was His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr. Yahya Abdul-Aziz Awal Jemus Junkung Jammeh Naasiru Deen Babili Mansa. He was Commander in Chief of The Armed Forces and Chief Custodian of the Sacred Constitution of the Gambia.

On 16 June 2015, a statement from the State House stated that President Jammeh should be addressed as &quot;His Excellency Sheikh Professor Alhaji Dr. Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh Babili Mansa&quot;. The title &quot;Babili Mansa&quot;, which the President decided to drop in December 2014, is a phrase in the Mandinka language that could be translated as either &quot;Chief Bridge Builder&quot; or &quot;Conqueror of Rivers&quot;. Two months before, he had already removed the title &quot;Nasirul Deen&quot; (&quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;), which had been conferred to him by the Gambia Supreme Islamic Council.

He has also received dubious awards through the International Parliament for Safety and Peace, an unrecognised higher education accreditation organisation. Among these was a Nebraska Admiral certificate; however, Rae Hein, a spokeswoman for the Governor of Nebraska, stated &quot;We regret that this individual has attempted to embellish a certificate for a Nebraska admiralship, claiming that it was a high honour bestowed upon him by the governor, when to the best of our knowledge, this person has no relationship with or ties to Nebraska.&quot; IPSP representatives also gave Jammeh two awards and a letter from Barack Obama that were later described as inauthentic or non-existent. Jammeh also received &quot;Russian&quot; and &quot;German&quot; honorary degrees from members of the IPSP.

<text>Alfonso Antonio Portillo Cabrera (born 24 September 1951) is a Guatemalan politician who served as the 45th president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004.

He took office on 14 January 2000, representing the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG), the party then led by retired general and deposed military ruler Efraín Ríos Montt (1926–2018). In 2014, ten years after his departure from the presidency, Portillo would plead guilty to corruption charges in a United States court.

==Early life and education==
Portillo was born in Zacapa. He obtained his academic qualifications in Mexico. He allegedly received a degree in social sciences from the Autonomous University of Guerrero (UAG) in Chilpancingo, Guerrero, and his doctorate from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City. However, the veracity of such claims remains to be determined since no evidence has been provided to support them.

==Career==
In the late 1970s, he became involved with left-wing indigenous groups in Guerrero and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG). During the 1980s, he lectured in political science at the university in Chilpancingo. During that time, Portillo shot and killed two students. He later claimed that he had shot the students in self-defense. His political opponents, however, asserted that he had killed the two unarmed students in a &quot;bar brawl.&quot; He was never charged for the shootings, and in 1995, a Mexican judge declared the case &quot;inactive.&quot;

In 1989, Portillo returned to Guatemala and joined the Social Democratic Party, which had replaced the Authentic Revolutionary Party the previous year. The little-known PSD was one of the few leftist parties that survived the military repression that characterized the 1970s and 1980s. He then moved to the Guatemalan Christian Democrats (DCG). This center-right formation was the governing party at that time. In 1992, he was appointed Director of the Guatemalan Institute of Social and Political Sciences (IGESP), a role he held till 1994. He became the DCG&#x27;s Secretary General in 1993, was elected as one of their deputies in 1994, and became head of their group in Congress. During this time, he also became an editorial adviser to &quot;Siglo Veintiuno,&quot; one of the two largest-selling daily newspapers. 

===FRG===
In April 1995, Portillo and another seven of the DCG&#x27;s 13 deputies, left the party to become independents after the parliamentary group was accused of corruption. On 20 July 1995, he joined the Guatemalan Republican Front (FRG). Its leader, Efraín Ríos Montt, was at the time leader of Congress. When Ríos Montt was constitutionally barred from running in the 12 November presidential election because he had previously taken power through a coup d&#x27;etat, the FRG chose Portillo as their candidate. After gaining 22% of the vote in the first round of voting, he lost to Álvaro Arzú in the second round on 7 January 1996. With both candidates promising to finalize the peace negotiations, Portillo narrowly lost, garnering 48.7% of the vote.

===Presidential aspirations===
In July 1998, the FRG voted for him to be their presidential candidate the following year, having decided not to nominate Ríos Montt. Portillo launched a campaign in favor of bringing morality into political life, to implacably fight corruption, and to defend the indigenous population and the poor campesinos against the small, urban, white elite. He also promised security in the face of the growing problem of delinquency during Arzú&#x27;s tenure in the office. In contrast to 1995, the issue of the homicides in Mexico was brought up and became a central electoral issue. Portillo immediately admitted that he had shot the two students but claimed it was an act of self-defense. He said that he had fled from the Mexican authorities rather than face trial, both because of his political affiliations and because he was a foreigner in Mexico. These revelations enhanced Portillo&#x27;s as a &quot;tough, no-nonsense&quot; politician. On 7 November, he won the first round with 47.8% of the vote, and in the second round on 26 December, he decisively beat Óscar Berger with 68.3% of the vote. 

===Presidency (2000–2004)===
On the day of his investiture, Portillo said that Guatemala was &quot;on the edge of collapse&quot; and promised a thorough government investigation into corruption. On 9 August 2000, he declared that the governments of the previous two decades had been involved in human rights abuses. While he showed determination to see through his regenerative and progressive program, his government soon became overwhelmed by the reality of the political and mafia corruption in the country. During 2001 his government faced a continuous wave of protests that sapped its credibility. The FRG was accused of bringing corruption to the nation on an unprecedented scale. His government has been tainted by accusations of theft, money laundering, money transferring to the army, and the creation of bank accounts in Panama, Mexico, and the United States by many members of his staff, totaling more than US$1 billion. 

In the first round of the November 2003 elections (see: 2003 Guatemala election), he backed former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt to succeed him. However, the FRG lost to Óscar Berger Perdomo&#x27;s GANA party, who was sworn in to replace Portillo on 14 January 2004.

A 2014 audit of 2001 showed illegal transfers from other departments to the military.

===Post-presidency===
When his political immunity was revoked on 19 February 2004, Portillo immediately fled to Mexico. On 16 August 2004, immigration authorities granted him a year-long work visa. He then lived in Mexico City in an apartment in one of the city&#x27;s most exclusive neighborhoods. Portillo was accused of authorizing $15 million in transfers to the Guatemalan defense department, where authorities believe most of the money was stolen by his associates. After a long process, Mexico&#x27;s foreign ministry approved Portillo&#x27;s extradition back to Guatemala on 30 October 2006. His actual extradition did not occur until 7 October 2008.

According to reports in May 2007, Portillo sued Guatemala in the Central American Court of Justice in Nicaragua to be reinstated as a member of the Central American Parliament (and thus regain his immunity from prosecution).

In January 2010, reports stated that the U.S. government was looking for Portillo in relation to money laundering charges.

On 26 January 2010, Portillo was apprehended by local authorities in Guatemala near Punta de Palma.

Portillo and his associates were absolved of all embezzlement charges on 9 May 2011 by a Guatemalan court that determined that prosecutors, Guatemala&#x27;s Public Ministry, did not present sufficient evidence to convict the former president. The Public Ministry stated they disagreed with the court&#x27;s decision and announced plans to appeal the ruling.

On 26 August 2011, the Constitutional Court ruled that he must be extradited to the United States. He would then be the first former Guatemalan President to stand prosecution in the United States. He was extradited to the United States on 24 May 2013 to face money laundering charges. He is accused of laundering US$70 million of Guatemalan money through US banks.

On 18 March 2014, former President Portillo pleaded guilty at a hearing before United States District Judge Robert P. Patterson. On 22 May 2014, Judge Patterson sentenced Portillo to 70 months in prison, $2.5 million in forfeiture and a $100 special assessment fee. Guatemala&#x27;s former president, 62 years of age, faced a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine or twice the money involved in the illegal transactions.

On 25 February 2015, Portillo was released from prison in Denver, the U.S., and returned to Guatemala City.

<doc id="392412" wikidata="Q202582" url="?curid=392412" title="Lansana Conté">
<text>Lansana Conté (; 30 November 1934 – 22 December 2008) was a Guinean politician and military official who served as the second president of Guinea from 1984 until his death in 2008. Conté came to power in the 1984 Guinean coup d&#x27;état.

==Early life==
Born in Moussayah Loumbaya (Dubréka), a member of the Susu ethnic group, he estimated his birthdate to be 1934, although he never knew exactly. Conté was educated at a local Quranic school and attended Dubréka primary school. He then went on to study at military preparatory schools in Bingerville, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire
and Saint Louis, Senegal.

==Military and government service==
In 1955, he enlisted in the French Army and was posted to Algeria during the war of independence in 1957. After his service in the French Army, Conté returned to Guinea, which became independent from France on 2 October 1958, and was integrated into the new army with the rank of sergeant. In 1962, he attended the Camp Alpha officer&#x27;s school in Conakry. Soon after, he was transferred to the 2nd Battalion artillery-training center in Kindia. On 1 July 1963, he was promoted to Second Lieutenant. This was followed two years later by another promotion from Second Lieutenant to Lieutenant. On 22 November 1970, Portuguese military together with Guinean dissidents invaded the country from Portuguese Guinea (now Guinea-Bissau) in an apparent attempt to overthrow the government of President Ahmed Sékou Touré and destroy PAIGC guerillas. For his service to the nation, he was promoted to the rank of Captain on 27 February 1971. In 1973, he was named commander of the Boké operational zone (in Northwestern Guinea) to assist the pro-independence guerrilla movement, African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) in neighboring Portuguese Guinea. On 10 May 1975, he was named assistant Chief of Staff of the army.

In 1977, he was head of the Guinean delegation during negotiations that resolved a border dispute with Guinea-Bissau and was elected to the National Assembly in 1980. Later that year, he took part in the ruling Democratic Party of Guinea&#x27;s (PDG) official pilgrimage to Mecca.

==Presidency==

===1984 coup and military rule===

President Ahmed Sékou Touré, Guinea&#x27;s head of state since independence, died on 26 March 1984. Prime Minister Louis Lansana Beavogui was named interim president, pending elections to be held within 45 days. On 3 April, however, hours before the PDG was to choose a new leader—who would have been the only candidate for president—Conté led a military coup that toppled the government. Conté denounced the Touré regime&#x27;s human rights abuses and released 250 political prisoners. He also encouraged the return of approximately 200,000 Guineans from exile, and the Camp Boiro detention center was closed down.

The country&#x27;s constitution was immediately suspended after the takeover, along with the National Assembly, and political activity was banned. A 25-member Military Committee of National Restoration (CMRN) was set up and led by Conté, who on 5 April was proclaimed President of the Republic.

On 4 July 1985, soldiers loyal to Conté, who was attending an Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) summit in Lomé, Togo, thwarted a counter-coup. Conté, a member of the Susu people (or Sousou), used the opportunity to eliminate rival soldiers from the Malinké ethnic group, including former Prime Minister Diarra Traoré.

On 3 April 1990, Conté was promoted to the rank of Army General.

===Economic and political transition===
Conté&#x27;s economic reforms, including currency devaluation and reduction of government spending met with approval of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and realignment with western nations encouraged foreign investments.

He initiated Guinea&#x27;s transition to civilian, multiparty rule in the early 1990s. A new constitution was approved in a referendum held on 23 December 1990 and the CMRN was disbanded on 16 January 1991. It was replaced by the Transitional Committee for National Recovery (CTRN), a body composed of civilians and military officials. Political parties were legalized in 1992 in preparation for upcoming elections.

===Civilian rule===
The first multi-party presidential election held since independence was conducted on 19 December 1993. Conté, candidate of the newly formed Party of Unity and Progress (PUP), won 51.7% of the vote—just barely enough to avoid a runoff. Alpha Condé of the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) was second with 19.6% of the vote. The opposition alleged electoral fraud, especially after the Supreme Court discounted as invalid the results in two prefectures where Condé of the RPG had received a large majority of the vote.

Despite Conté&#x27;s stated commitment to democracy, his regime remained authoritarian. However, he had far less power than Touré, and for the most part his rule was much milder.

Conté&#x27;s government narrowly survived a 2 February 1996 coup attempt that stemmed from an army mutiny over payment of salaries. Several dozen civilians were killed, and the presidential residence sustained significant damage.

In Guinea&#x27;s second multi-party presidential election, held on 14 December 1998, Conté won another five-year term with 56.1% of the vote. The polls, although an improvement over the troubled 1993 election, were considered flawed by opposition parties and observers. A November 2001 referendum that lifted presidential term limits and would extend the term in office from five to seven years was supported by 98.4% of the voters. The results, however, were rejected by opposition parties who claimed that the outcome was rigged.

He went on to win a third presidential election held on 21 December 2003 with 95.6% of the vote after all but one of the opposing candidates boycotted the race, expressing their belief that Conté would never allow a fair election. Conté had been in declining health, suffering from diabetes and heart problems, and his ability to serve and survive another full term in office was doubted by many. He was sworn in on 19 January 2004, and in a television broadcast on this occasion, he vowed to fight corruption.

On 19 January 2005, shots were reportedly fired at his motorcade on its way into Conakry in what was apparently a failed assassination attempt. One bodyguard was reportedly wounded. Conté, who was unharmed, went on state radio and television that night to say that he had survived because God had not yet decided it was his time to die. He also mentioned &quot;threats from those who do not wish to see the development of Guinea or those who obey orders given to them from abroad&quot; and vowed that he would &quot;not be manipulated&quot;. On the next morning, he made a public appearance to pray. One eyewitness of the shooting told RFI that the attackers had exchanged gunfire with Conte&#x27;s bodyguards for about four minutes before dropping their weapons and fleeing.

While on a visit to France with his family in 2005, Prime Minister François Lonseny Fall resigned and sought asylum. He complained of corruption and increasing interference from Conté. Fall&#x27;s successor, Cellou Dalein Diallo, endured until April 2006. Conté failed to appoint a new prime minister until the end of January 2007.

In April 2006 he was flown to Morocco for medical treatment. Most people expected he would not return, but he did. Then in May 2006 riots in Conakry over the price of rice and fuel led to around twenty deaths as security forces savagely repressed the popular uprising. In August 2006 he was again flown to Switzerland for medical treatment. This time no crowds met him on his return to Guinea. Meanwhile, Henriette Conté, the President&#x27;s first wife, was accused of flouting the rule of law and taking advantage of the President&#x27;s physical and mental incapacity to abuse her power.

In August 2006 Human Rights Watch produced a 30-page report condemning human rights abuses in Guinea, highlighting the power vacuum resulting from the President&#x27;s ongoing illness, and expressing concern about the future.

In an interview with journalists reported by Guinéenews in October 2006, Lansana Conté said that he intended to stay as president until 2010, which was the end of his seven-year term. Conté also said that he was looking for a replacement who &quot;loves the country and will protect it against its enemies.&quot;

In November 2006 Transparency International updated its annual Corruption Index. Guinea under Lansana Conté was then second equal as the most corrupt country in the world (pride of place for corruption going to Haiti). This is a matter of concern for foreign firms intending to invest in Guinea (for example to exploit its extensive bauxite reserves) as they are unable to operate in Guinea without paying huge bribes to highly placed government officials, but if caught doing so they may face legal action in their country of origin.

In January 2007, a general nationwide strike was held protesting Conté&#x27;s continued leadership of the country. The strike continued for over two weeks, during which hundreds of thousands of protesters marched in the streets. Within the first two weeks, savage repression by red-caps (Presidential guards) and other security forces left at least twenty protesters dead. By the end of the strike on 27 January, it was reported that at least 90 protesters had died in violent clashes with police and at least 300 had been injured, according to a local human rights group.

The strike ended following an agreement between Conté and the labor unions, according to which a new Prime Minister would be appointed as head of government; Conté also agreed to lower rice and fuel prices. On 9 February, Conté appointed Eugène Camara, who had been Minister of State for Presidential Affairs since January, as Prime Minister. This was rejected by the opposition, and widespread violence broke out after the appointment. The strike resumed on 12 February, and Conté declared martial law on the same day. On 25 February Conté agreed to a deal to end the strike, and on 26 February he appointed a new Prime Minister, Lansana Kouyaté, from a list of individuals chosen by the unions and representatives of civil society; people returned to work on 27 February. Kouyaté was sworn in on 1 March in a ceremony at which Conté was not present.

In an interview with Agence France-Presse and TV5 on 14 June 2007, Conté asserted that he was still in charge of the country (&quot;I&#x27;m the boss, others are my subordinates&quot;), rejected the possibility of a transition, and said that his appointment of a prime minister was not due to pressure and that he was pleased with Kouyaté&#x27;s performance.

On 5 December 2007, a decree restructuring ministries increased the powers of the Secretary-General of the Presidency at the expense of those of the Prime Minister, and on 3 January 2008 Conté dismissed and replaced Justin Morel Junior, the Minister of Communication and Government Spokesman, without consulting Kouyaté. On 4 January, Kouyaté demanded that Morel be restored to his position, and labor unions announced plans to begin a new &quot;unlimited general strike&quot; on 10 January, demanding that Conté&#x27;s agreement with the unions be properly implemented and that Morel be restored. On 9 January, the unions withdrew their call for a strike.

In a surprise move, on 20 May 2008, Conté dismissed Kouyaté and replaced him with Ahmed Tidiane Souaré. Kouyaté was widely considered a disappointment in his role as Prime Minister, and his unpopularity meant that his dismissal was not greeted with any major unrest of the kind that led to his appointment a year earlier. Through this dismissal and the appointment of Souaré, who was considered close to Conté, Conté was considered to have strengthened his position.

==Health issues and death==

In his final years, Conté left the country for medical treatment on numerous occasions, and speculation about his health had long been widespread. Contrary to his usual practice, Conté did not appear on television to mark Tabaski earlier in December 2008, which sparked renewed speculation. At around the same time, a newspaper published a photograph suggesting that Conté was in poor physical condition and having difficulty standing up. The editor of that newspaper was arrested, and the newspaper was required to print a photograph in which Conté looked healthy.

Conté died on 22 December 2008 at 6:45 pm local time, according to a statement read on television by Aboubacar Somparé, the President of the National Assembly, who said he had suffered from &quot;a long illness&quot;, but did not specify the cause of death. According to Somparé, Conté &quot;hid his physical suffering&quot; for years &quot;in order to give happiness to Guinea.&quot; Somparé requested that the President of the Supreme Court, Lamine Sidimé, declare a vacancy in the Presidency and apply the constitution. Prime Minister Souaré and Diarra Camara, the head of the army, stood alongside Somparé during his announcement. Declaring 40 days of national mourning for Conté, Souaré urged &quot;calm and restraint&quot;. He told the army to secure the borders and maintain calm within the country &quot;in homage to the memory of the illustrious late leader&quot;. According to the constitution, the President of the National Assembly was to assume the presidency in the event of a vacancy, and a new presidential election was to be held within 60 days.

Six hours after Somparé announced Conté&#x27;s death, a coup d&#x27;état was announced on state media. This statement, read by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara on behalf of a group called the National Council for Democracy and Development (CNDD), said that &quot;the government and the institutions of the Republic have been dissolved&quot;. The statement also announced the suspension of the constitution &quot;as well as political and union activity&quot;.

Conté&#x27;s funeral was held in Conakry on 26 December. His body was put on display in the parliament building before being taken to the national stadium, where over 20,000 people were in attendance. Leaders of neighboring countries were present for the funeral. General Mamadou Ba Toto of the CNDD said at the funeral that &quot;we pray God to give us the courage to continue [Conté&#x27;s] work of tolerance and peace for the welfare of Guinea&quot;. Afterwards, his body was buried in the village of Lansanya in front of his mansion. It was taken out of its coffin and placed into the ground, then covered with handfuls of dirt tossed by mourners. The burial was marked by some disorder, as thousands of mourners tried to reach the grave and security forces formed a cordon around it.

==History==
The Odawara Express Railway Co. opened the entire line on 1 April 1927 in order to allow for the Emperor&#x27;s family to travel on the line, though as duplication works were not completed until October that year, there was initial timetable and signalling issues. Although primarily intended as a passenger line, gravel began to be hauled in 1930.

In 1942, the company was forcibly merged by the government with Tokyu Corporation and the line was named the Tokyu Odawara Line. Tokyu was broken up in 1948 and the line was transferred to the newly founded Odakyu Electric Railway Co.

Through operation to the Hakone Tozan Railway&#x27;s Hakone Tozan Line began in 1950 once dual gauge track was commissioned (the Hakone Tozan Line is , the Odawara Line ). A connecting track was laid in 1955 to Matsuda Station on the Gotemba Line of the (then) Japanese National Railways, and limited express service through to the line started. To function as a bypass to central Tokyo, through service on the Eidan Subway (now Tokyo Metro) Chiyoda Line commenced in 1978 via Yoyogi-Uehara.

Increasing traffic volume since the 1970s led to plans being formed in 1985 for a track upgrading project on the Odawara Line, though land acquisition issues stalled major track expansion work until construction began in 2013; the project is being carried out between Yoyogi-Uehara and Mukōgaoka-Yūen, quadrupling the Odawara Line trackage and stacking the tracks underground, allowing for increased express services. Originally a viaduct was planned but this was changed to underground tracks, and work on the tunnel between Setagaya-Daita and Higashi-Kitazawa was completed in 2018.

<text>Pad Abort Test 1 was the first abort test of the Apollo spacecraft on November 7, 1963.

==Objectives==
Pad Abort Test 1 was a mission to investigate the effects on the Apollo spacecraft during an abort from the pad. The launch escape system (LES) had to be able to pull the spacecraft away from an exploding rocket on the launch pad. The LES then had to gain enough altitude to allow the command module&#x27;s parachutes to open, preferably with the spacecraft over water and not land.

The flight featured a production model LES and a boilerplate (BP-06) Apollo spacecraft, the first mission to feature one. The spacecraft carried no instruments for measuring structural loads as the capsule&#x27;s boilerplate structure did not represent that of a real spacecraft.

==Flight==
On November 7, 1963, an abort signal was sent to the LES at 09:00:01 local time. This began a sequence in which the main solid rockets fired to lift the spacecraft and smaller altitude rockets fired to move it laterally toward the ocean.

The LES separated after 15 seconds, allowing the spacecraft to take a ballistic trajectory. The parachute system worked perfectly: the drogue chute stabilized the spacecraft, then the three main parachutes slowed the descent to a leisurely 26 kilometers per hour.

The only problems found with the flight were that the LES rockets left soot on the spacecraft exterior and the stability of the spacecraft was less than predicted.

<doc id="392417" wikidata="Q286130" url="?curid=392417" title="Henrique Rosa">
<text>Henrique Pereira Rosa (18 January 1946 – 15 May 2013) was a Bissau-Guinean politician who served as interim President of Guinea-Bissau from 2003 to 2005. He was born in 1946 in Bafatá.

==Interim President of Guinea-Bissau==
Rosa served as the interim President of Guinea-Bissau from 28 September 2003 until 1 October 2005. His appointment came following a military coup that deposed the elected government of President Kumba Ialá on 14 September, and subsequent talks between political officials, civil society leaders, and the Military Committee for the Restitution of Constitutional and Democratic Order, led by Veríssimo Correia Seabra.

The main goal of the Rosa-led caretaker government was to administer elections that would return the country to constitutional, democratic rule. This was achieved in March 2004 with the holding of a free and fair legislative election. A presidential election held in June and July 2005 was also considered democratic and transparent. The latter election was won by João Bernardo &quot;Nino&quot; Vieira, who had previously been President from 1980 to 1999; Rosa was not a candidate.

Additionally, during the two-year interim presidency, Rosa&#x27;s government managed to bring a level of political stability to Guinea-Bissau along with notable improvements to the country&#x27;s human rights record.

==Resignation and subsequent political activity==
Rosa handed over power to Vieira on 1 October 2005.

Rosa stood as an independent candidate in the June 2009 presidential election, finishing in third place.

==Death==
On 15 May 2013, Rosa died at a hospital in Porto, in northern Portugal, after losing a nine-month battle with lung cancer. He was 67 years old.

<text>John Kofi Agyekum Kufuor (born 8 December 1938) is a Ghanaian politiciana who served as the tenth president of Ghana from 2001 to 2009. He was the fifth chairperson of the African Union from 2007 to 2008 and his victory over John Atta Mills at the end of Jerry Rawlings&#x27; second term marked the first transition of power in Ghana from a democratic party to another democratic party.
Kufuor&#x27;s career has been spent on the liberal-democratic side of Ghanaian politics, in the parties descended from the United Gold Coast Convention and the United Party. 
As a lawyer and businessman, he was a minister in Kofi Abrefa Busia&#x27;s Progress Party government during Ghana&#x27;s Second Republic, and a Popular Front Party opposition frontbencher during the Third Republic. In the Fourth Republic, Kufuor stood as the New Patriotic Party&#x27;s candidate at the 1996 election, and then led it to victory in 2000 and 2004. Having served two terms in power, he retired from politics in 2008. He is popularly known as the &quot;Gentle Giant&quot;.

==Early life and schooling==

The scion of a royal maternal lineage, John Kufuor was born in Daaban, a suburb of Kumasi in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. He started his primary and elementary school at the Kumasi Government School located in Asem built by Sir Gordon Guggisberg. Kufuor was the 7th of 10 children of Nana Kwadwo Agyekum, an Asante and Nana Ama Dapaah, a Queen Mother. In 1951, he continued his primary (then called &#x27;standard&#x27; three) education at Osei Tutu Boarding School (Osei Tutu Senior High School) from 1951 to 1953. At Prempeh College from 1954 to 1958, he schooled from Form 1 to Form 5. Arriving in London on 30 April 1959, he was by June accepted into Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, London (1959–61) to study law, becoming qualified as a barrister in one year and eight months. He was called to the London bar in 1961. In the following year, he was called to the bar in Ghana before going on to Oxford University, graduating from Exeter College, in 1964. He was initially employed at the Ghana Commercial Bank in London as a manager and legal officer. He returned to Ghana in the year 1965 at the behest of his mother who (having already bought a first-class ticket for his return) wished him to practice in Africa. He practiced in the Chambers of Victor Owusu with another lawyer, Owusu Yaw. In 1966, he became the town clerk of Kumasi City Council (now Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly). In the Second Republic&#x27;s Parliamentary register, Kufuor listed his hobbies and interests as table tennis, reading, football, and film shows. He was once the chairman of Kumasi Asante Kotoko Football Club.
==Early political career==

After completing his education, Kufuor returned to Ghana and launched his political career. In 1967, he became chief legal officer and town clerk for the city of Kumasi. By 1969, he was a member of Parliament and deputy foreign minister in the government of Kofi Abrefa Busia. Kufuor served as the Member of Parliament for Atwima Nwabiagya in the Second (1969–72) and Third (1979–81) Republics. He is a founding member of the Progress Party which was established in Busia&#x27;s house. As Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, he represented Ghana on a number of occasions. From 1969 to December 1971, he led Ghana&#x27;s delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Ministerial Meetings in Addis Ababa, and the Summit Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Lusaka. In 1970 he led the Ghanaian delegation to Moscow in the Soviet Union, Prague (Czechoslovakia), and Belgrade (Yugoslavia) to discuss Ghana&#x27;s indebtedness to these countries. As the Spokesman on Foreign Affairs and Deputy Opposition Leader of the Popular Front Party (PFP) Parliamentary Group during the Third Republic, he was invited to accompany President Hilla Limann to the OAU Summit Conference in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He was also a member of the parliamentary delegation that visited the United States in 1981 to talk to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank on Ghana&#x27;s economic problems. In January 1982, the leadership of the All People&#x27;s Party (APP), which was an alliance of all the opposition parties, advised some leading members, including the Deputy Leader of the Alliance, Alhaji Iddrisu Mahama, its general secretary, Dr Obed Asamoah and Kufuor, to accept an invitation from the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) to serve in what was purported to be a National Government. Kufuor was appointed the Secretary for Local Government in this new government. As Secretary for Local Government, he wrote the Local Government Policy Guidelines that were to be the foundation of the current decentralized District Assemblies.
==Elections==

On 20 April 1996, Kufuor was nominated by 1034 out of 2000 delegates of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) drawn from all the 200 Constituencies of the Country to run for the president of Ghana on 10 December 1996. After campaigning for less than nine months, Kufuor polled 39.62% of the popular votes to Rawlings&#x27; 57% in the 1996 election. On 23 October 1998 he was re-nominated by the New Patriotic Party not only to run again for president but also to officially assume the position of Leader of the Party. Kufuor won the presidential election of December 2000; in the first round, held on 7 December, Kufuor came in first place with 48.4%, while John Atta-Mills, Jerry Rawlings&#x27; Vice-president, came in second with 44.8%, forcing the two into a run-off vote. In the second round, held on 28 December, Kufuor was victorious, taking 56.9% of the vote. When Kufuor was sworn in on 7 January 2001, it marked the first time in Ghana&#x27;s history that an incumbent government had peaceful transition of power to the opposition. Kufuor was re-elected in presidential and parliamentary elections held on 7 December 2004, earning 52.45% of the popular vote in the first round and thus avoiding a run-off, while at the same time Kufuor&#x27;s party, the New Patriotic Party, was able to secure more seats in the Parliament of Ghana.
==Presidency==

His administration&#x27;s domestic policy in the first term was marked by fiscal and monetary stringency on the economic front, aimed at stabilizing a national economy that stagnated and was in decline. His social vision was focused on unleashing the entrepreneurial, creative and innovative potential of Ghanaians as a means of creating wealth and hence dealing with the social challenges facing them. This socioeconomic vision was encapsulated in the Five Priority Areas Programme, viz., the pursuit of good governance, modernization of agriculture for rural development, private sector participation, enhanced social services and vigorous infrastructure development. His administration is said to have received the most financial assistance in the history of Ghana, due essentially to donors&#x27; distrust for the military governments before it, as well as those with some military connections. Kufuor&#x27;s foreign policy was underpinned by what he termed &quot;economic diplomacy&quot;. It is within this context that in Africa in general and in West Africa in particular, a good neighborliness policy has been pursued, which saw Ghana under Kufuor brokering peace in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau, among other African states. On the global stage, Kufuor actively sought the establishment of a just and equitable international social and economic order, while promoting and safeguarding the interests of Ghana through bilateral and multilateral agreements. His stature as statesman, democrat and credible spokesman for Africa found expression in his invitation to major international meetings and conferences including the founding summit of the AU, G8 Summits in Sea Island, Georgia and Gleneagles, Scotland, and the World Economic Forum. He served as chairman of the regional grouping ECOWAS for two consecutive terms – 2003 and 2004. In 2007, due to the policy successes his administration accumulated, Kufuor had his mandate renewed in 2004 and was sworn into office on 7 January 2005. Policy direction in Kufuor&#x27;s second presidential term built on the foundations laid in the first four years. The administration pursued Ghana&#x27;s socioeconomic transformation in the second term, using the three-pronged approach of private-sector development, human resource development and good governance. At the international level, Kufuor consolidated Ghana&#x27;s position as the voice of Africa, credible peace broker, beacon of democracy (Ghana was the first country to undergo Peer Review under NEPAD&#x27;s Africa Peer Review Mechanism) and responsible member of the committee of nations. On 29 January 2007, Kufuor was elected as Chairperson of the African Union for the 2007–08 AU session. He was succeeded by Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania on 31 January 2008. Kufuor was involved in a car accident during his presidency on 14 November 2007, in which another car collided with his, causing it to roll over several times. Kufuor was reported to be uninjured.
===Health===
He started the National Health Insurance Scheme to replace the existent cash-and-carry system; 11 million Ghanaians were registered under this scheme. He set up the National Ambulance Service and built more than 205 hospitals and clinics. He also built a state-of-the-art emergency centre at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. Kufuor also introduced free maternal health care in public hospitals for all expectant mothers.
===Education===
Kufuor institutionalised the capitation grant for school children at the basic level, whereby each student was entitled to $2 for cultural sports and development. He also started the national school feeding programme. He changed the Senior Secondary School curriculum from three years to four years and renamed it Senior High School. He started the model school senior high school concept, in which some deprived schools were upgraded to the level of some first-class senior high schools.
===Access to finance===
Kufuor launched the Microfinance and small loans program (MASLOC) – a US $50million fund that makes micro loans available to the productive population – and introduced the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty Program (LEAP), which provides direct cash transfers to poor households in the country who could not support themselves. For the first time in Ghana&#x27;s history, borrowing became so cheap and available that microfinance companies (and major banks) actually went on to the streets to encourage small-scale businessmen and women to apply for loans.
===Sports===
He renovated the Accra Sports Stadium and the Baba Yara Stadium as well as built the Essipong and Tamale stadiums in 2008 to host the CAN 2008. Under Kufuor Ghana qualified for the World Cup in 2006. President Kufuor&#x27;s good governance policy led to Ghana obtaining a record $500 million grant from the U.S Millennium Challenge Account for economic development. The social vision behind the grant was anchored on unleashing the entrepreneurial, creative and innovative potential of Ghanaians as a means of creating wealth and hence dealing with the social challenges facing Ghanaians. This socio-economic vision was encapsulated in the Five Priority Areas Programme vis the pursuit of good governance, modernisation of agriculture for rural development, private sector participation, enhanced social services and vigorous infrastructural development. The George Walker Bush Highway was also built from this fund.
==Personal life==
Kufuor, at the age of 23, married Theresa Kufuor (née Mensah) in 1962 after they met at a Republic Day Anniversary Dance in London in 1961; they have five children together. Kufuor and his family belong to the Roman Catholic Church. He is a Senior Grand Warden of the United Grand Lodge of England Freemasons, and has openly professed his membership as a Freemason since being a young lawyer. An Asante, Kufuor speaks the Twi language fluently. He was known for using his language whenever he was campaigning in his native Ashanti Region. Kufuor and his family reside in Accra, Ghana&#x27;s capital. His wife, Theresa Kufuor, died on 1 October 2023. Kufour has nine siblings - four brothers and five sisters.
==Post-presidency==
In July 2009, Kufuor became a member of the SNV Netherlands Development Organization International Advisory Board to contribute his expertise to the organization&#x27;s poverty reduction work. In September 2009, Kufuor spoke in the Netherlands at a Dutch government event to mark &#x27;60 years of development aid&#x27; at the invitation of Dutch Minister Bert Koenders, which was attended by nearly 2,000 people. During his visit to the Netherlands, he was interviewed by the newspaper &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot; and the &quot;Internationale Samenwerking&quot; magazine. He argued for the importance of effective development assistance, pointing out that development aid helped Ghana enter the international capital market. On 21 September 2009, he delivered the prestigious Legatum Pericles Lecture at the Legatum Center for Development and Entrepreneurship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kufuor is the Governing Council Chairman of Interpeace, an international peace building organisation based in Geneva since October 2009. Also in 2009, he served on the High Level Commission on the Modernization of World Bank Group Governance, which – under the leadership of Ernesto Zedillo – conducted an external review of the World Bank Group&#x27;s governance. Kufuor was chosen together with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to jointly receive the 2011 World Food Prize for their personal commitment and visionary leadership while serving as the presidents of Ghana and of Brazil, respectively, in creating and implementing government policies to alleviate hunger and poverty in their countries. The foundation said the significant achievements of these two Laureates illustrate that transformational leadership truly can effect positive change and greatly improve people&#x27;s lives. On 20 September 2011, Kufuor inaugurated the John Agyekum Kufuor (JAK) Foundation with a ground-breaking ceremony for the JAK Centre for Leadership, Governance and Development at the University of Ghana, Legon. The inaugural lecture, which attracted very high local and foreign dignitaries, had Horst Köhler, former president of Germany, as its guest speaker. Thabo Mbeki, former president of South Africa, and Ghana ex-president Jerry John Rawlings, Kufuor&#x27;s fiercest critic, were among the dignitaries who attended the ceremony. The ex-presidents also unveiled a plaque on 22 September 2011 for the Kufuor Presidential Library and Museum at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, which formed part of the John A. Kufuor Foundation. In September 2018 the foundation set up the Kufuor Young Entrepreneurs Network (K-YEN). This initiative supports and develops young entrepreneurs to excel in their endeavors. In October 2011, Kufuor received the 2011 World Food Prize, along with President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for his personal commitment and visionary leadership while serving as the president of Ghana, and in creating and implementing government policies to alleviate hunger and poverty in his country. Since November 2011, Kufuor has been the first high-level chair of the Sanitation and Water for All (SWA) partnership. Numerous NPP supporters tried to barricade President Kufuor&#x27;s house on 7 January 2013 to prevent him from attending John Dramani Mahama&#x27;s inauguration, which the NPP as a party had decided to boycott as they felt going would undermine their challenge to Mahama&#x27;s win in court. Kufuor explained that the party had allowed him to go because he was invited as an ex-President of Ghana and not as a Member of the NPP to the chagrin of the supporters. The Ghana Police Service (GPS) reinforcement had to be sent to his abode to allow him to be able to go for the programme. In September 2017, the George Grant University of Mines and Technology (UMaT) appointed Kufour as the first Chancellor of the university, the appointment taking effect from 1 November 2017. The Investiture of was held in January 2018.
== 2024 General Elections ==
In a lead up to the 2024 Ghana Elections, Former President John Kufour publicly endorsed Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia&#x27;s presidential campaign, highlighting his impressive skills in economic management as the reason for his endorsement. He received serious criticism from Alan Kyerematen, who expressed his endorsement of Dr. Bawumia has tarnished the impartiality expected of a former statesman.

<text>Bharrat Jagdeo (born 23 January 1964) is a Guyanese politician who has been serving as Vice President of Guyana since 2020, in the administration of President Irfaan Ali. He had previously also held the office from 1997 until 1999, during the presidency of Janet Jagan. Jagdeo subsequently served as the President of Guyana from 11 August 1999 to 3 December 2011. He also holds a number of global leadership positions in the areas of sustainable development, green growth and climate change.

Jagdeo, a member of the People&#x27;s Progressive Party/Civic (PPP/C), served as Minister of Finance from 1995 to 1999, becoming president in 1999 after Janet Jagan resigned for health reasons. Subsequently, he won two elections, in 2001 and 2006. He was the first and youngest President of Guyana to relinquish office in accordance with term limits he signed into the Guyanese Constitution.

Following the PPP/C&#x27;s electoral defeat in 2015 Jagdeo became Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly. Furthermore, when the PPP/C returned to power in 2020, Jagdeo was sworn in as a vice president in the administration of president Irfaan Ali. Vice News alleged that it had uncovered corruption by Jagdeo and several Chinese businessmen. These allegations were rejected by Jagdeo who pointed out instead, that the Vice News documentary failed to provide irrefutable evidence to substantiate its claims and it mostly relied on hearsay and comments by a Chinese businessman Su Zhi Rong against whom he has filed a defamation lawsuit.

==Early and personal life==
Jagdeo was born in Unity Village in Demerara-Mahaica, in then British Guiana in 1964 to Hindu Indian parents. In 1912, his grandfather, Ram Jiyawan had immigrated under the Indian indenture system to British Guiana from the village of Pure Thakurain in the Amethi district of the Awadh region of the United Provinces in British India (present-day state of Uttar Pradesh in India). During his visit to India once, Jagdeo went to his ancestral village and it was found that a community of salt makers called Nonias happened to be the community from which his ancestors belonged to. Jagdeo joined the youth wing of the People&#x27;s Progressive Party (PPP), the Progressive Youth Organisation, when he was 13, and became a member of the PPP itself at age 16. He subsequently rose to local leadership positions in the party.

He attended Bygeval Multilateral High School before migrating to Russia in 1984 for higher studies. After obtaining a master&#x27;s degree in economics from Patrice Lumumba Peoples&#x27; Friendship University in Moscow in 1990, Jagdeo returned to Guyana and worked as an economist in the State Planning Secretariat until the PPP-Civic election victory in the October 1992 election. After this he became Special Advisor to the Minister of Finance.

Jagdeo was appointed as Junior Minister of Finance in October 1993, and a few weeks later, at the PPP&#x27;s 24th Congress, he was elected to the party&#x27;s Central Committee. He later became a member of the executive committee of the PPP. In the Cabinet, he was promoted to Senior Minister of Finance in May 1995. In December 1997, he was appointed as the Second Vice President. 

In 1998, Jagdeo married Varshnie Uma Singh in a Hindu wedding ceremony. However, the union was never legally registered. The couple ended their marriage in 2007. Singh had accused Jagdeo of domestic violence, with Jagdeo refuting her allegations. Singh later clarified she suffered &quot;institutionalized, verbal, emotional, and psychological abuse&quot; by Jagdeo.

==Prime Minister and President==
On 8 August 1999, Janet Jagan announced that she was resigning as president for health reasons, and that Jagdeo would be her successor. Because the Prime Minister is the President&#x27;s legal successor, Jagdeo took office as Prime Minister on 9 August, so that he would be positioned to succeed Jagan. He was then sworn in as president on 11 August. At age 35, he was one of the youngest heads of state in the world.

Jagdeo was re-elected for another five-year term on 28 August 2006, with the PPP garnering 54.6 percent of the votes. It expanded its majority, by two, to 36 seats in the 65-member parliament. He was sworn in for another term on 2 September.

At the PPP&#x27;s 29th Congress, Jagdeo received the highest number of votes (777) in the election to the party&#x27;s Central Committee, held on 2 August 2008. He was then elected to the PPP Executive Committee on 12 August 2008.

In late 2011, his term of office officially came to an end as a result of the term limit amendment to the Constitution, piloted by his government, and signed into law by himself, which created a two-term limit for anyone elected president after 2000. He was succeeded by PPP/C presidential candidate Donald Ramotar, who was elected president in the 28 November 2011 general elections. Under the Constitution, President Jagdeo&#x27;s term officially ended on 3 December 2011, when Ramotar took the presidential oath of office.

==Initiatives==
During Jagdeo&#x27;s tenure as president, major economic and social reforms were initiated in Guyana. When he relinquished office, Guyana had experienced five consecutive years of strong economic growth, often out-pacing other South American countries. External debt had been almost halved, and reserves had almost tripled compared to the 2006 situation. During the presidency, investments had been made in social services which resulted in improved access to education. The housing sector saw its biggest expansion in its history. Road, river and air transport infrastructure were improved.

In 2003, in his role as Lead Head of Government for Agriculture in the Caribbean Community, Jagdeo spearheaded a process (known as the &quot;Jagdeo Initiative&quot;) to create a more competitive and sustainable agricultural sector in the region by 2015.

In his final term as president, President Jagdeo became a global advocate for international action to avert the worst extremes of climate change, and was described by the Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra K. Pachauri, as &quot;one of perhaps half a dozen Heads of Government who truly understands the issue&quot;. In line with the President&#x27;s global advocacy, Guyana&#x27;s Low Carbon Development Strategy sets out a national scale, replicable model to protect Guyana&#x27;s 18 million hectare forest, to address the 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions that result from deforestation and forest degradation, and re-orient the Guyanese economy onto a long-term &quot;low deforestation, low carbon, climate resilient trajectory&quot;.

As part of building this global model, Norway is partnering with Guyana to provide up to US$250 million, by 2015, for avoided greenhouse gas emissions from Guyana&#x27;s forest. Guyana is using these payments and domestic resources to attract private investment to opportunities in clean energy and new low carbon economic sectors, as well as to make significant public investments in other social and economic priorities. This has been described by the Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network, the UK-based climate policy network, as &quot;maybe the most progressive low carbon development strategy in a low income country.&quot;

Jagdeo was a signatory to the UNASUR Constitutive Treaty of the Union of South American Nations in May 2008. Guyana has ratified the treaty. In November 2009, Jagdeo hosted the heads of government of South America in Georgetown, at his one-year anniversary of the pro tempore presidency of UNASUR.

On 26 November 2011, Jagdeo made a far-reaching farewell address ahead of the nation&#x27;s elections on 28 November 2011. He spoke of accomplishments, such as the economy and defense issues, and emphasised his optimism in the future of Guyana.

==Corruption and greenwashing allegations==

In June 2020, Vice News conducted a six-week investigation into allegations of bribery, greenwashing and corruption against Jagdeo. Specifically, their report focused on the relationship between Jagdeo and Chinese investment in mining and energy projects that were at odds with the nation&#x27;s and Jagdeo&#x27;s pledges to address the Climate crisis and Biodiversity crisis. The documentary investigation showed undercover footage of Mr Jagdeo seeming to accept bribes although without wanting to know the details of the deal which he was entering, with Su Zhi Rong dealing with the particularities.

In an interview with Vice News and several national papers, Jagdeo rejected allegations of corruption and claimed instead that the Vice News documentary failed to provide first-hand evidence of corrupt transactions as it mostly relied on hear-say and comments by Chinese Businessman, Su Zhi Rong against whom he has filed a defamation lawsuit.

==Honours==
Jagdeo has been conferred with honorary doctorates of the Peoples&#x27; Friendship University of Russia, TERI University, the University of Central Lancashire and Trent University.

Jagdeo was awarded the Pushkin Medal by the Government of Russia.

In April 2013, Jagdeo was conferred with the highest honour of the State of Roraima, Brazil, the Order of Merit &#x27;Forte Sao Joaquim&#x27;.

==Awards==
In 2004 he received the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman from the President of India in the field of public affairs.

==International profile and post-presidency career==
President Jagdeo was elected as chairman of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in September 2005. He occupied this position until September 2006.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine named Jagdeo as one of their &quot;Heroes of the Environment&quot; in 2008, and he was awarded the United Nations &quot;Champion of the Earth&quot; award in 2010.

In early 2010, the Secretary General of the United Nations asked Jagdeo to serve on the Secretary General&#x27;s High Level Advisory Group on Climate Financing.

Jagdeo is a Patron of the Delhi-based World Sustainable Development Forum.

In 2011, Heads of State and other leaders from the world&#x27;s rainforest countries asked him to be &quot;Roving Ambassador for the Three Basins&quot; (Amazon, Congo Basin, South East Asia).

In March 2012, the world&#x27;s largest and oldest environmental organisation, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), announced that President Jagdeo would become the IUCN High Level Envoy for Sustainable Development in Forest Countries and an IUCN Patron of Nature.

Jagdeo is also the President of the Assembly of the Korea-based Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), having been a Founding Board Member of GGGI since 2010. GGGI is the world&#x27;s newest international organization, and has 20 Member States.

In June 2013, Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma announced that former President Jagdeo would lead a high-level team of experts to identify solutions for unlocking resources to enable small, poor and climate-vulnerable Commonwealth countries to combat climate change. The former president was joined by eight others to create a set of recommendations for the international community to help identify practical solutions for those countries most vulnerable to climate change. Jagdeo presented the report to the 53 Heads of Government and other leaders of the Commonwealth, representing about a fifth of the world&#x27;s population at the 2014 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

Jagdeo travelled from the 2015 CHOGM to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change summit in Warsaw where he spoke of the outcomes of CHOGM and the need for continued leadership from Prime Ministers and Presidents. In a major speech in Warsaw, he stated: &quot;In the next 24 months much progress needs to be made if we are going to have a climate agreement. We can still stop the absolute worst extremes of climate change, and start the massive shift towards global low carbon development... The world tried to do this in 2009 at Copenhagen, and failed. As a consequence, more people will die, more livelihoods will be destroyed, more economies will suffer and the cost of action has gone up steadily...If we fail again in 2015, the damage and the costs will become truly unmanageable...Future generations will ask: how could we be so selfish not once, but twice?&quot;

He has been a Special Ambassador to the FAO for Forests and the Environment (an FAO Goodwill Ambassador) since 2016.

In March 2013, the ACP Council of Ministers inaugurated a 14-member Eminent Persons Group (EPG) whose mission will be to provide guidance and concrete recommendations for the future of the ACP Group. The 14 members of the group who met in Brussels designated the former Nigerian President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, as their chairperson, with Jagdeo designated as one of two Vice Chairs.

Jagdeo has been a guest lecturer at Columbia University (New York City, USA), York University (Toronto, Canada), Trent University (Peterborough, Canada), the University of Toronto, United Nations University (Tokyo, Japan), and the University of the West Indies. He has also taken part in Trent University&#x27;s Carbon Conversation, focusing on the need to de-carbonize the global economy.

===Leader of the Opposition===
Following the PPP&#x27;s defeat in the May 2015 general election, Jagdeo was included in the list of the PPP&#x27;s 32 MPs. He was sworn in as Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly on 17 August 2015.

===Vice president===
In March 2020, the PPP won the 2020 Guyanese general election, but an attempt was made by the incumbent APNU+AFC government to stay in power illegally. Jagdeo was to the fore of domestic and international efforts to protect the democratic process, and see a peaceful transition of power. The support of the US Government (who placed sanctions on several members of the incumbent Government), and others, resulted in the swearing in of Irfaan Ali as president.

After the PPP regained the presidency, President Ali swore in Jagdeo as the first Vice President on 3 August 2020. Jagdeo also shortly held the position of Minister of Finance until Ashni Singh was appointed the minister.

<doc id="392424" wikidata="Q1164811" url="?curid=392424" title="Video Killed the Radio Star">
<text>&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; is a song written by Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley in 1979. It was recorded concurrently by Bruce Woolley and the Camera Club (with Thomas Dolby on keyboards) for their album &quot;English Garden&quot; and by British new wave/synth-pop group the Buggles, which consisted of Horn and Downes (and initially Woolley).

The Buggles&#x27; version of the track was recorded and mixed in 1979, released as their debut single on 7 September 1979 by Island Records, and included on their first album &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;.

The song relates to concerns about, and mixed attitudes toward 20th-century inventions and machines for the media arts. The song has been positively received, with reviewers praising its unusual musical pop elements.

On release, the Buggles single topped sixteen international music charts, including those in the UK, Australia, and Japan. It also peaked in the top 10 in Canada, Germany, New Zealand and South Africa, but only reached number 40 in the US. The accompanying music video was written, directed, and edited by Russell Mulcahy. It was the first music video shown on MTV in the US, airing at 12:01a.m. on 1 August 1981, and the first video shown on MTV Classic in the UK on 1 March 2010. The song has received several critical accolades, such as being ranked number 40 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest One-Hit Wonders of the &#x27;80s&quot;. 

The song has also been covered by many recording artists.

==Background and lyrics==
The Buggles, which formed in 1977, first consisted of Trevor Horn, Geoff Downes and Bruce Woolley. They recorded the first demo of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; on a Revox A77 tape recorder, one afternoon in 1978, in Downes&#x27; flat located above a monumental stonemason&#x27;s in Wimbledon Park, London. The piece was built up from a chorus riff developed by Woolley. It is one of the three Buggles songs on which Woolley assisted in writing, the two others being &quot;Clean, Clean&quot; and &quot;On TV&quot;. A later, more detailed demo of the song, featuring Horn&#x27;s then-girlfriend Tina Charles on vocals, was recorded at Camden&#x27;s Soundsuite Studios, and engineered by studio owner Peter Rackham. This demo became the blueprint for the final record, and helped the group get signed to Island Records to record and release their debut album &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;, as well as producing and writing for the label, after Downes&#x27; girlfriend, who worked for Island, managed to get it played to executives there. Woolley left during recording to form his own band, The Camera Club, which did their own version of &quot;Video&quot;, as well as &quot;Clean, Clean&quot; for their album &quot;English Garden&quot;.

Horn has said that J. G. Ballard&#x27;s short story &quot;The Sound-Sweep&quot;, in which the title character—a mute boy vacuuming up stray music in a world without it—comes upon an opera singer hiding in a sewer, provided inspiration for &quot;Video&quot;, and he felt &quot;an era was about to pass.&quot; Horn claimed that Kraftwerk was another influence of the song: &quot;It was like you could see the future when you heard Kraftwerk, something new is coming, something different. Different rhythm section, different mentality. So we had all of that, myself and Bruce, and we wrote this song probably six months before we recorded it.&quot; In a 2018 interview Horn stated: &quot;I&#x27;d read JG Ballard and had this vision of the future where record companies would have computers in the basement and manufacture artists. I&#x27;d heard Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;The Man-Machine&quot; and video was coming. You could feel things changing&quot;.

All the tracks of &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; deal with positives and concerns of the impact of modern technology. The theme of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; is thus nostalgia, with the lyrics referring to a period of technological change in the 1960s, the desire to remember the past and the disappointment that children of the current generation would not appreciate the past. The lyrics relate to concerns of the varied behaviours towards 20th-century technical inventions and machines used and changed in media arts such as photography, cinema, radio, television, audio recording and record production. According to Horn, the band initially struggled to come up with a line to follow the song&#x27;s opening (&quot;I heard you on the wireless back in &#x27;52&quot;): he eventually came up with &quot;Lying awake intent at tuning in on you&quot;, inspired by memories of listening to Radio Luxembourg at night as a child. Woolley worried about the song&#x27;s name, given the existence of a band with the name Radio Stars and a song titled &quot;Video King&quot; by singer Snips.

==The Buggles version==
===Development and composition===
The Buggles&#x27; version of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; is a new wave and synth-pop song. It performs like an extended jingle, sharing its rhythm characteristics with disco. The piece plays in common time at a bright tempo of 132 beats per minute. It is in the key of D♭ major, and six basic chords are used in the song&#x27;s chord progression. According to Geoff Downes, &quot;It&#x27;s actually a lot more complicated piece of music than people think, for instance part of the bridge is actually suspended chords and minor 9ths. A lot of people transcribed the song wrongly, they thought it was a straight F# chord. The song was written in D flat. The suspended gives it a slightly different feel.&quot; Writing in his book, &quot;Pop Music: Technology and Creativity: Trevor Horn and the Digital Revolution&quot;, Timothy Warner said that the &quot;relatively quiet introduction&quot; helped the listener detect a high amount of &quot;tape hiss&quot; generated through the use of analog multi-track tape recorders, as well as the timbre of the synthesized instruments, give an indication of the technical process and time of producing the song.

Horn and Downes tried to interest labels in the song, but were turned down multiple times, including by Island Records. Downes&#x27; then girlfriend worked for Island and was able to get the song listened to again. The demo ended up being heard by Chris Blackwell, who chose to sign the band.

The song took more than three months of production. In 2018 Downes stated that the version that was released was rewritten from that recorded for the band&#x27;s demo tape: the verses were extended and Downes contributed a new intro and middle eight, with the bulk of the original song having already been written by Horn and Woolley when he joined. The instrumental track was recorded at Virgin&#x27;s Town House in West London in twelve hours, with mixing and recording of vocals held at Sarm East Studios. The entire song was mixed through a Trident TSM console. &quot;Video&quot; was the first track recorded for the group&#x27;s debut LP, &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot;, which cost a sum of £60,000 () to produce, and the song was mixed by Gary Langan four or five times. According to Langan, &quot;there was no total recall, so we just used to start again. We’d do a mix and three or four days later Trevor would go, &#x27;It&#x27;s not happening. We need to do this and we need to do that.&#x27; The sound of the bass drum was one of his main concerns, along with his vocal and the backing vocals. It was all about how dry and how loud they should be in the mix without the whole thing sounding ridiculous. As it turned out, that record still had the loudest bass drum ever for its time.&quot;

The song includes instrumentation of drums, bass guitar, electric guitar, synth strings, piano, glockenspiel, marimbas and other futuristic, twinkly sounds, and vocals. Downes used a Solina, Minimoog and Prophet-5 to create the overdubbed orchestral parts. Both the male and female voices differ to give a tonal and historical contrast. When Langan was interviewed in December 2011, he believed the male vocal was recorded through either a dynamic Shure SM57, SM58, Sennheiser MD 421, or STC 4038 ribbon microphone, and that four or five takes had to be done. The male voice echoes the song&#x27;s theme in the tone of the music, initially limited in bandwidth to give a &quot;telephone&quot; effect typical of early broadcasts, and uses a Mid-Atlantic accent resembling that of British singers in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. The Vox AC30 amplifier was used to achieve the telephone effect, and Gary Langan says he was trying to make it &quot;loud without cutting your head off&quot;. Gary Langan and Trevor Horn also tried using a bullhorn, but they found it too harsh. Langan later compressed and EQ&#x27;d the male vocals, and he said that doing the compression for old-style vocal parts was a &quot;real skill&quot;. The female vocals are panned in the left and right audio channels, and sound more modern and have a New York accent.

The single version of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; lasts for 3 minutes and 25 seconds. The album version plays for 4 minutes and 13 seconds, about 48 seconds longer than the single version, as it fades into a piano and synth coda, which ends with a brief sampling of the female vocals.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; was a huge commercial success, reaching number one on 16 national charts. The song made its debut on the UK Singles Chart in the top 40 at number 24, on the issue dated 29 September 1979. The next week, the track entered into the chart&#x27;s top ten at number six before topping the chart on the week of 20 October. It was the 444th UK number-one hit in the chart&#x27;s entire archive. In 2022, the single was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for UK sales and streams of 600,000 units.

In Australia, &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; reached number one, and for 27 years it held the country&#x27;s record for best-selling single. In late 1979, while the single was still in an eight-week run at Number one in the charts, the single was awarded a platinum disc by Festival Records, the record&#x27;s distributing company, for sales of over 100,000 copies in Australia. The song also made a number-one peak in France and Spain, where it was certified gold and platinum, respectively, as well as Austria, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland. In other parts of Europe and Oceania, &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; was a number-two hit in Germany and New Zealand, and also charted in Flanders on the Ultratop 50 and in the Netherlands, on the Nationale Hitparade Top 50 (now the Single Top 100) and Dutch Top 40.

&quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; did not start charting in North America, however, until November 1979. In the United States, the song appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100, barely breaking into the top 40 on both charts. In a 2015 list from &quot;Billboard&quot;, it tied with Marvin Gaye&#x27;s recording of &quot;The End of Our Road&quot; as the &quot;Biggest Hot 100 Hit&quot; at the peak of number 40. &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; debuted at number 86 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on the week of 10 November 1979, while on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 it debuted at number 83 that same week. It started also at number 83 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Top Single Chart. By January 1980, it entered the top 40 at number 31, and on 2 February made it into the top 20 at number 11. Two weeks later, the song earned its peak in the top 10 at number 6 and issue dated 16 February 1980.

===Critical reception===
The song became a &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Single Pick on 3 November 1979. The publication found the chorus catchy and also highlighted the orchestral instruments supporting the backing singers. Although there had been a mixed review of the single from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; by Andy Partridge of XTC, who found the song to be &quot;too tidy, like vymura&quot; (wallpaper), they listed it in a review of &quot;The Age of Plastic&quot; as one of the best tracks of the album, along with &quot;Living in the Plastic Age&quot;. Timothy Warner wrote that, although several common pop elements were still present in the song, it included stronger originality for its own purpose than most other pop hits released at the time. These unusual pop music characteristics include the timbres of the male and female vocal parts, and the use of suspended fourth and ninths chords for enhancement in its progression. He also felt it was unnecessary to dislike it as a &quot;novelty song&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Heather Phares said the track &quot;can be looked on as a perfectly preserved new wave gem&quot;, &quot;just as the song looks back on the radio songs of the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s&quot;. She concluded her review by saying that it &quot;still sounds as immediate as it did when it was released, however, and that may be the song&#x27;s greatest irony&quot;. The Woolley version ranked number 18 for 2 weeks on Canada&#x27;s CHUM Chart, May 19 and 26, 1980.

However, many writers called Woolley&#x27;s recording of &quot;Video&quot; much better than the Buggles&#x27; version. This included one critic who called both acts overall as of being very high quality, but felt that Woolley&#x27;s version was more faithful to the source material than that of the Buggles, noting the filtered vocals and cute, female vocals of the latter rendition as giving it a novelty feel. However, he also wrote of liking both versions of &quot;Clean, Clean&quot; on the same level.

In 2024, &quot;Billboard&quot; recognized &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; as one of the 100 greatest songs about the music industry, ranking it at number one.

===Music video===
====Production and concept====

The music video for &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, written, directed and edited by Australian Russell Mulcahy, was produced on a budget of $50,000. The video was shot in one day in South London, and was edited over two days.

The video begins with a young girl sitting in front of a radio. A black-and-white shot of Trevor Horn singing into an early radio-era microphone is superimposed over the young girl by the radio. The radio explodes by the time of the first chorus, then in the second verse, the girl is seen transported into the future, where she meets Horn and a silver-jumpsuited woman in a clear plastic tube. Shots of Horn and Geoff Downes are shown during the remainder of the video.

Around 30 takes were required for shots of the actress in the tube. The tube falls over in the video, although Mulcahy claims it was not intended to be shown in the final edit. Hans Zimmer can be briefly seen wearing black playing a keyboard, and Debi Doss and Linda Jardim-Allen, who provided the female vocals for the song, are also seen.

====Broadcasting and reception====
The music video was first released in 1979, when it was originally broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for promotion of the single, in lieu of doing live performances. Zimmer recalled in 2001 that the video drew criticism from some viewers who watched it before it aired on MTV, due to being too violent&#x27; because we blew up a television.&quot; The music video for &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; is notable as the first video ever played on MTV, when the US channel began broadcasting at 12:01 AM on 1 August 1981. On 27 February 2000, it became the one millionth video to be broadcast on MTV. It also opened MTV Classic in the UK and Ireland. The video marked the closing of MTV Philippines before its shutdown on 15 February 2010 at 11:49 PM. MTV co-founder Bob Pittman said the video &quot;made an aspirational statement. We didn&#x27;t expect to be competitive with radio, but it was certainly a sea-change kind of video.&quot; In July 2013, multiple independent artists covered the song for the launch of the TV channel Pivot, which launched with the music video of the cover on 1 August at 6am.

The Presidents of the United States of America recorded a cover of the song which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1998 film &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; starring Adam Sandler.

A rare live performance of the song by Horn and Downes came at a ZTT showcase in 1998.

In November 2006, the Producers played at their first gig in Camden Town. A video clip can be seen on ZTT Records of Horn singing lead vocals and playing bass in a performance of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;. Tina Charles appears on a YouTube video singing &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; with the Producers and Horn reveals that Charles was the singer and originator of the &quot;Oh Ah-Oh Ah-Oh&quot; part of the song; fellow 5000 Volt member Martin Jay was also a session musician on The Buggles record.

Robbie Williams performed the song with Trevor Horn at the BBC Electric Proms on 20 October 2009.

Erasure covered this song as a final track to their &quot;Other People&#x27;s Songs&quot; album. Vince Clarke in an interview said that he considers it &quot;the perfect pop song&quot;.

Anne Dudley, composer and co-founding member of The Art of Noise with Trevor Horn, performed the song on solo piano on her album &quot;Anne Dudley Plays the Art of Noise&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In mid-2020, the song became popular among TikTok users as a trend to revisit celebrity death conspiracies, and across the internet when a deepfake of Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin singing the song went viral on multiple social media sites.

In February 2002, while on international duty with England, David Beckham became involved in an argument with journalist Rob Shepherd during a press conference after Shepherd made a joke about David and Victoria Beckham&#x27;s habit of finishing second (David finishing second in the recent FIFA World Player of the Year vote, and Victoria&#x27;s inability to have a number 1 hit). Beckham sarcastically asked Shepherd, &quot;What do you know about music? How many people in your family have ever had a number one?&quot; Shepherd replied, &quot;One. My sister was in The Buggles.&quot; His sister was Linda Jardim-Allen, who sang vocals on the song.

<text>In graph theory and computer science, an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each unordered list within an adjacency list describes the set of neighbors of a particular vertex in the graph. This is one of several commonly used representations of graphs for use in computer programs.

==Implementation details==
An adjacency list representation for a graph associates each vertex in the graph with the collection of its neighbouring vertices or edges. There are many variations of this basic idea, differing in the details of how they implement the association between vertices and collections, in how they implement the collections, in whether they include both vertices and edges or only vertices as first class objects, and in what kinds of objects are used to represent the vertices and edges.
* An implementation suggested by Guido van Rossum uses a hash table to associate each vertex in a graph with an array of adjacent vertices. In this representation, a vertex may be represented by any hashable object. There is no explicit representation of edges as objects.
* Cormen et al. suggest an implementation in which the vertices are represented by index numbers. Their representation uses an array indexed by vertex number, in which the array cell for each vertex points to a singly linked list of the neighboring vertices of that vertex. In this representation, the nodes of the singly linked list may be interpreted as edge objects; however, they do not store the full information about each edge (they only store one of the two endpoints of the edge) and in undirected graphs there will be two different linked list nodes for each edge (one within the lists for each of the two endpoints of the edge).
*The object oriented incidence list structure suggested by Goodrich and Tamassia has special classes of vertex objects and edge objects. Each vertex object has an instance variable pointing to a collection object that lists the neighboring edge objects. In turn, each edge object points to the two vertex objects at its endpoints. This version of the adjacency list uses more memory than the version in which adjacent vertices are listed directly, but the existence of explicit edge objects allows it extra flexibility in storing additional information about edges.

==Operations==
The main operation performed by the adjacency list data structure is to report a list of the neighbors of a given vertex. Using any of the implementations detailed above, this can be performed in constant time per neighbor. In other words, the total time to report all of the neighbors of a vertex &quot;v&quot; is proportional to the degree of &quot;v&quot;.

It is also possible, but not as efficient, to use adjacency lists to test whether an edge exists or does not exist between two specified vertices. In an adjacency list in which the neighbors of each vertex are unsorted, testing for the existence of an edge may be performed in time proportional to the minimum degree of the two given vertices, by using a sequential search through the neighbors of this vertex. If the neighbors are represented as a sorted array, binary search may be used instead, taking time proportional to the logarithm of the degree.

==Trade-offs==
The main alternative to the adjacency list is the adjacency matrix, a matrix whose rows and columns are indexed by vertices and whose cells contain a Boolean value that indicates whether an edge is present between the vertices corresponding to the row and column of the cell. For a sparse graph (one in which most pairs of vertices are not connected by edges) an adjacency list is significantly more space-efficient than an adjacency matrix (stored as a two-dimensional array): the space usage of the adjacency list is proportional to the number of edges and vertices in the graph, while for an adjacency matrix stored in this way the space is proportional to the square of the number of vertices. However, it is possible to store adjacency matrices more space-efficiently, matching the linear space usage of an adjacency list, by using a hash table indexed by pairs of vertices rather than an array.

The other significant difference between adjacency lists and adjacency matrices is in the efficiency of the operations they perform. In an adjacency list, the neighbors of each vertex may be listed efficiently, in time proportional to the degree of the vertex. In an adjacency matrix, this operation takes time proportional to the number of vertices in the graph, which may be significantly higher than the degree. On the other hand, the adjacency matrix allows testing whether two vertices are adjacent to each other in constant time; the adjacency list is slower to support this operation.

==Data structures==
For use as a data structure, the main alternative to the adjacency list is the adjacency matrix. Because each entry in the adjacency matrix requires only one bit, it can be represented in a very compact way, occupying only bytes of contiguous space, where is the number of vertices of the graph. Besides avoiding wasted space, this compactness encourages locality of reference.

However, for a sparse graph, adjacency lists require less space, because they do not waste any space to represent edges that are not present. Using a naïve array implementation on a 32-bit computer, an adjacency list for an undirected graph requires about bytes of space, where is the number of edges of the graph.

Noting that an undirected simple graph can have at most edges, allowing loops, we can let denote the density of the graph. Then, when , that is the adjacency list representation occupies more space than the adjacency matrix representation when . Thus a graph must be sparse enough to justify an adjacency list representation.

Besides the space trade-off, the different data structures also facilitate different operations. Finding all vertices adjacent to a given vertex in an adjacency list is as simple as reading the list. With an adjacency matrix, an entire row must instead be scanned, which takes time. Whether there is an edge between two given vertices can be determined at once with an adjacency matrix, while requiring time proportional to the minimum degree of the two vertices with the adjacency list.

<text>Anote Tong (; born 11 June 1952) is an I-Kiribati environmental activist and former politician for the Pillars of Truth party with half Chinese heritage, who served as the fourth president of Kiribati, from 2003 to 2016. He won the election in July 2003 with a slim plurality of votes cast (47.4%) against his older brother, Harry Tong (43.5%) and the private lawyer Banuera Berina (9.1%). The elections were contested by the opposition, due to allegations of electoral fraud but the High Court of Tarawa had confirmed that there was no fraud. He was re-elected on 17 October 2007 for a second term (64%). In 2012, Tong was reelected for a third term, although with a significantly smaller percentage than in the previous two elections.

Tong is primarily known abroad for his efforts to raise &quot;global awareness on the threat posed by climate change&quot;.

== Early and personal life ==
Born in Tabuaeran, Line Islands, he is the third of six children of Tong Ting Hai, a Chinese migrant who settled in the Gilberts after World War II, and Nei Keke Randolph, from the islands of Abaiang and Maiana in Kiribati. He went to St Bede&#x27;s College in New Zealand for his secondary school education, graduated from Canterbury University with a degree in Science, and then gained a Masters in Economics degree from the London School of Economics. He is married to an I-Kiribati woman, Nei Meme Tong, and has seven children, among them his elder Vincent Tong, elected MP for Maiana in 2020. Tong considers himself originally from this island of Maiana, located in central Gilbert Islands.

== Political career ==
Tong entered politics in 1976 as an assistant secretary of the Ministry of Education, then served in the Ministry of Communications and Works in the 80s. Elected in 1994, at the Maneaba ni Maungatabu, he was nominated Minister for Environment and Natural Development by Teburoro Tito, and occupied this function until March 2002.
During the 2003 election campaign, he promised to review the lease of a spy and satellite tracking base used by the People&#x27;s Republic of China and &quot;to take appropriate actions at the right time.&quot; On 7 November 2003, the People&#x27;s Republic of China withdrew its ambassador from the island nation, and on 29 November of the same year, ties between the two countries ceased. Kiribati established ties with the Republic of China, which led the People&#x27;s Republic of China to sever relations and vacate its satellite base nearly a month later.

Tong was overwhelmingly re-elected to his seat in parliament in the August 2007 parliamentary election. On 17 October 2007, he was re-elected as president by a large majority. The opposition boycotted the election due to the exclusion of two opposition candidates, including Tong&#x27;s brother Harry.

Tong was re-elected to a third, and final, four-year term as president in the January 2012 election. Tong won a little over 40% of the popular vote. He defeated two challengers, including his nearest rival, Tetaua Taitai, by more than 2,000 votes. Tong reappointed Teima Onorio to a third term as Vice President of Kiribati on 19 January 2012, as part of his cabinet appointments for his third term.

He retired from politics after the Kiribati parliamentary election, 2015–16.
His son, Vincent Tong, is elected MP for Maiana during 2020 Kiribati parliamentary elections.

== Post-presidency ==
In the elections of 2020, Tong told Reuters that &quot;it was the most aggressive campaign [he] had seen&quot; in the country&#x27;s history, and that though maintaining partiality since retiring from politics in 2016, Tong opined on the switching of recognition on the One-China policy that there were &quot;some strong feelings against China in Kiribati&quot;. In September 2022, amid the Kiribati constitutional crisis, Tong said that Kiribati was &quot;moving towards authoritarianism&quot;, after the government withdrew from the Pacific Islands Forum and suspended all judges from its high and appellate courts, calling the moves &quot;unprecedented&quot;.

==Issues==
A women&#x27;s rights group, the Kiribati National Council of Women, has been formed recently for the primary purpose of advocating for a proposed new government entity, one that would be the Ministry of Women and Children. A bill that among other actions would create this bureau passed through the House of Assembly of Kiribati on 23 August 2012 and reached the second round of voting, but was ultimately voted against due to a blurry outline on budgetary proportioning. After the National Council of Women voiced its discontent, President Tong stated that &quot;the defeat was unfortunate, but it does not mean that we will not continue to support the women&#x27;s issues. As a government, we will do it via other means, and perhaps it will come back to Parliament in the future.&quot; This variably leaves the door open for women&#x27;s rights to become an even greater issue than it already is in Kiribati. This Ministry was finally created in October 2013.

Tong also stood front and center in the push to create the Phoenix Islands Protected Area. Due partly to this effort, Tong received in 2012 a Peter Benchley Ocean Award for &quot;creating one of the World&#x27;s largest and most biologically rich marine protected areas.&quot; He has been criticized, however, due to his hesitation in closing the preserve to fishing.

== Global advocate on climate change and environmental protection ==
Tong has been at the forefront of raising global awareness about catastrophic risks caused by climate change. With his atoll nation of Kiribati rising an average height of two meters above sea level, rising sea levels due to climate change pose an existential threat to Kiribati and other small island states in the Pacific. Tong directed Kiribati&#x27;s purchase of approximately 20 square kilometers of land in Fiji in 2014 as a contingency refuge for his people. This follows advice from the IPCC following its fifth assessment that many Pacific Island states such as Kiribati could be submerged by rising sea levels within a few decades. Tong has said the purchase of land in Fiji was partly an investment in property, partly for food security purposes since it is prime farming land, but also a last resort it could be a home for the I-Kiribati people fleeing from the effects of climate change. Anote Tong, dubbed as a &#x27;climate warrior&#x27;, pioneered the notion of &#x27;migration with dignity&#x27; to avoid the people of Kiribati from becoming &#x27;climate refugees&#x27;.

Tong is responsible for a number of other initiatives to combat climate change and protect the environment, such as calling for a global moratorium on using coal in 2015, as well as overseeing the creation of a 480,250 square kilometer marine park, the largest protected marine area in the world. The marine park was later adopted as a UNESCO World Heritage List site (Phoenix Islands Protected Area, or PIPA).

As part of his global advocacy on climate change, Tong has met with various world leaders to discuss the plight of small island states, including Pope Francis, US President Obama and spoke recently before world leaders at the COP21 Paris meeting. Tong also currently serves on the board of Conservation International.

On 24 October 2018, he gave an interview where expressed concerns that his nation &quot;will soon be disappearing under the sea&quot;, he also said that the Island is disappearing but that the current President Taneti Maamau refuses to act on it.

Also in October, 2018, he criticized Australia for &quot;doing nothing&quot; to solve the climate change issue. He was quoted as saying that: &quot;We are being told that we may have to abandon our islands, the places where our ancestors have been buried, where our children have a home.&quot; and regretted that the United States had pulled out from the Paris Agreement.

===Criticism of Australia and New Zealand===
In the aftermath of the COP26 climate summit, Tong said that &quot;one weakness in the force of our campaign [for global climate action] has been the lack of unity in purpose with the larger members of our Pacific family. It has been a huge source of disappointment for us to witness the constant changes of climate policies with the eddies of political parties in power, in both Australia and New Zealand.&quot;

== Awards ==
Tong has been awarded leadership and environmental prizes for his work both in environmental protection and his advocacy on climate change and its effects. For example, Tong was awarded the 2015 Sunhak Peace Prize, and in 2012 both the Leadership Award from the Hillary Institute of International Leadership and the Peter Benchley Ocean Award. Tong has also been awarded a number of other awards such as the Order of Brilliant Jade with Grand Cordon by the President of Taiwan (2009), and the David B. Stone Award by the New England Aquarium Foundation (2008).

== Anote Tong Foundation ==
During his term of office (2003–2016), he developed the country&#x27;s commitment to climate change. He is the founder of the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, one of the world&#x27;s largest marine conservation areas that has also been recorded on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Anote Tong is board member of Conservation International, and was previously an ambassador for the Global Challenges Foundation.

<text>Kim Yong-nam (; born 4 February 1928) is a North Korean retired politician who served as the President of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly of North Korea, from 1998 until 2019. Previously, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1983 to 1998. He was elected a member of the Presidium of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK) in 2010.

==Life and career==
Accounts of Kim&#x27;s early life vary. According to Fyodor Tertitskiy of NK News, he was born Kim Myong-sam to a Korean-Chinese family in the village of Dapu Shihe in Manchuria, in what is now the Liaoning province of China, in 1928. He came to North Korea with the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army during the Korean War and chose to stay. Shortly before the end of the war in 1953, he went to the USSR to study. His experience with the USSR (including many years of study at Russian Universities) and China propelled his career in foreign affairs. In 1956, he became a section chief at the Foreign Department of the Central Committee of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and was a vice-minister for foreign affairs by 1962.

According to his official biography, Kim was born in Heijō, Chōsen (now Pyongyang, North Korea). After graduating from university, he worked as a teacher at the Central Party School, vice-department director of the WPK Central Committee, vice-minister of foreign affairs, and first vice-department director, department director and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, vice-premier of the administration council and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs. His elevation to Minister of Foreign Affairs is believed to have occurred as part of a reorganization of the diplomatic bureaucracy after the Rangoon bombing in October 1983. In 1988, he was responsible for the arrangement of unofficial diplomatic contacts with the United States through their respective embassies in Beijing.

As chairman of the Presidium, Kim Yong-nam was sometimes called the &quot;nominal head of state&quot; of North Korea. He held this office from September 5, 1998 to April 11, 2019. The President of the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly is sometimes considered the &quot;number two official&quot;. The journalist and academic Don Oberdorfer described Kim as enigmatic, rigid in his official role, personally pleasant, highly intelligent, and an important figure behind the scenes in Pyongyang. He has been assessed as having high-level political and diplomatic skills.

===Diplomatic activity===

Kim embarked on a two-week tour of Mongolia, Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Singapore on July 20, 2007. On March 18, 2008, he embarked on a goodwill tour of four African states. Arriving in Namibia on March 20, he was present for the official completion of a new presidential residence that was built by North Korea. He also held talks with Namibian President Hifikepunye Pohamba and signed an agreement on public health cooperation with Pohamba. He subsequently visited Angola, where he met President José Eduardo dos Santos on March 24, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where he met President Joseph Kabila on March 26, and Uganda, where he met President Yoweri Museveni on March 29. He returned to North Korea on April 1.

Kim also attended the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony on August 8, 2008, 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony on February 7, 2014, 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony on February 9, 2018, and the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony on June 14, 2018. On July 14, 2009, Kim met Vietnamese president Nguyen Minh Triet on the sidelines of the 15th Non-Aligned Movement Summit in Egypt. Kim represented North Korea at the 2015 Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9, 2015, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. He also paid an official visit to Equatorial Guinea on May 19, 2016 to attend the presidential inauguration of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo.

As representative of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, he attended the investiture ceremony of Andrés Manuel López Obrador as president of Mexico on December 1, 2018.

===Retirement===

He retired on April 11, 2019 in a government reshuffle, aged 91, after almost 21 years as President of the SPA Presidium and roughly four decades as Party Politburo member (having first been elected to the body in August 1978). During the 2022 celebration of the Day of the Foundation of the Republic, he participated in the central concert and banquet which took place in the yard of the Mansudae Assembly Hall.

<text>A herbarium (plural: herbaria) is a collection of preserved plant specimens and associated data used for scientific study.

The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts; these will usually be in dried form mounted on a sheet of paper (called &quot;exsiccatum&quot;, plur. &quot;exsiccata&quot;) but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservative. The specimens in a herbarium are often used as reference material in describing plant taxa; some specimens may be types, some may be specimens distributed in series called exsiccatae.

The same term is often used in mycology to describe an equivalent collection of preserved fungi, otherwise known as a fungarium. A xylarium is a herbarium specialising in specimens of wood. The term hortorium (as in the Liberty Hyde Bailey Hortorium) has occasionally been applied to a herbarium specialising in preserving material of horticultural origin.

== History ==
The techniques for making herbaria have changed little over at least six centuries. They have been an important step in the transformation of the study of plants from a branch of medicine to an independent discipline, and to make available plant material from far away places and over a long period of time.

The oldest traditions of making herbarium collections have been traced to Italy. The &quot;Bologna&quot; physician and botanist, Luca Ghini (1490–1556) reintroduced the study of actual plants as opposed to relying on classical texts, such as Dioscorides, which lacked sufficient accuracy for identification. At first, he needed to make available plant material, even in winter, hence his &quot;Hortus hiemalis&quot; (winter garden) or &quot;Hortus siccus&quot; (dry garden). He and his students placed freshly gathered plants between two sheets of paper and applied pressure to flatten them and absorb moisture. The dried specimen was then glued onto a page in a book and annotated. This practice was supplemented by the parallel development of the &quot;Hortus simplicium&quot; or &quot;Orto botanico&quot; (botanical garden) to supply material, which he established at the University of Pisa in 1544. 

Although Ghini&#x27;s herbarium has not survived, the oldest extant herbarium is that of Gherardo Cibo from around 1532. and in the Lower Countries the &quot;hortus siccus&quot; (1566) of Petrus Cadé. While most of the early herbaria were prepared with sheets bound into books, Carl Linnaeus came up with the idea of maintaining them on free sheets that allowed their easy re-ordering within cabinets.

== Specimen preservation ==

Commensurate with the need to identify the specimen, it is essential to include in a herbarium sheet as much of the plant as possible (e.g., roots, flowers, stems, leaves, seed, and fruit), or at least representative parts of them in the case of large specimens. To preserve their form and colour, plants collected in the field are carefully arranged and spread flat between thin sheets, known as &quot;flimsies&quot; (equivalent to sheets of newsprint), and dried, usually in a plant press, between blotters or absorbent paper.

During the drying process the specimens are retained within their flimsies at all times to minimize damage, and only the thicker, absorbent drying sheets are replaced. For some plants it may prove helpful to allow the fresh specimen to wilt slightly before being arranged for the press. An opportunity to check, rearrange and further lay out the specimen to best reveal the required features of the plant occurs when the damp absorbent sheets are changed during the drying/pressing process.

The specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labelled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned, and the case disinfected.

Certain groups of plants and fungi are soft, bulky, or otherwise not amenable to drying and mounting on sheets. For these plants, other methods of preparation and storage may be used. For example, conifer cones and palm fronds may be stored in labelled boxes. Representative flowers or fruits may be pickled in formaldehyde to preserve their three-dimensional structure. Small specimens, such as saprophytic and plant parasitic microfungi, mosses and lichens, are often air-dried and packaged in small paper envelopes.

No matter the method of preservation, detailed information on where and when the plant and fungus was collected, habitat, color (since it may fade over time), and the name of the collector is usually included.

The value of a herbarium is much enhanced by the possession of &quot;types&quot;, that is, the original specimens on which the study of a species was founded. Thus the herbarium at the British Museum, which is especially rich in the earlier collections made in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, contains the types of many species founded by the earlier workers in botany. It is also rich in types of Australian plants from the collections of Sir Joseph Banks and Robert Brown, and contains in addition many valuable modern collections. The large herbaria have many exsiccata series included in their collections.

== Collections management ==

Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases. Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the species to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight folder that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by genus. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic family according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets.

Locating a specimen filed in the herbarium requires knowing the nomenclature and classification used by the herbarium. It also requires familiarity with possible name changes that have occurred since the specimen was collected, since the specimen may be filed under an older name.

== Uses ==
Herbarium collections can have great significance and value to science, and have many uses.
Herbaria have long been essential for the study of plant taxonomy, the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. Most of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s collections are housed at the Linnaean Herbarium, which contains over 4,000 types and now belongs to the Linnean Society in England. Modern scientists continue to develop novel, non-traditional uses for herbarium specimens that extend beyond what the original collectors could have anticipated.

Specimens housed in herbaria may be used to catalogue or identify the flora of an area. A large collection from a single area is used in writing a field guide or manual to aid in the identification of plants that grow there. With more specimens available, the author or the guide will better understand the variability of form in the plants and the natural distribution over which the plants grow.

Herbaria also preserve a historical record of change in vegetation over time. In some cases, plants become extinct in one area or may become extinct altogether. In such cases, specimens preserved in a herbarium can represent the only record of the plant&#x27;s original distribution. Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in climate and human impact.

Herbaria have also proven very useful as source of plant DNA for use in taxonomy and molecular systematics. Even ancient fungaria represent a source for DNA-barcoding of ancient samples.

Many kinds of scientists and naturalists use herbaria to preserve voucher specimens; representative samples of plants used in a particular study to demonstrate precisely the source of their data, or to enable confirmation of identification at a future date.

They may also be a repository of viable seeds for rare species.

== Institutional herbaria ==
Many universities, museums, and botanical gardens maintain herbaria. Each is assigned an alphabetic code in the &quot;Index Herbariorum,&quot; between one and eight letters long.

<text>Askar Akayevich Akayev (, ; born 10 November 1944) is a Kyrgyz former politician who served as President of Kyrgyzstan from 1990 until being overthrown in the March 2005 Tulip Revolution.

==Education and early career==
Akayev was born in Kyzyl-Bayrak, Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic. He was the eldest of five sons born into a family of collective farm workers. He became a metalworker at a local factory in 1961. He subsequently moved to Leningrad, where he trained as a physicist and graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Precision Mechanics and Optics in 1967 with an honors degree in mathematics, engineering and computer science. He stayed at the institute until 1976, working as a senior researcher and teacher. In Leningrad he met and in 1970 married Mayram Akayeva with whom he now has two sons and two daughters. They returned to their native Kyrgyzstan in 1977, where he became a senior professor at the Frunze Polytechnic Institute. Some of his later cabinet members were former students and friends from his academic years.

He obtained a doctorate in 1981 from the Moscow Institute of Engineering and Physics, having written his dissertation on holographic systems of storage and transformation of information. In 1984, he became a member of the Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences, rose to vice president of the academy in 1987 and then president of the academy in 1989. He was elected as a deputy in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in the same year.

==Political career==

On 25 October 1990, the Kirghiz SSR&#x27;s Supreme Soviet held elections for the newly created post of president of the republic. Two candidates contested the presidency, President of the Council of Ministers of Kirghiz SSR, Apas Jumagulov, and First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Kirghiz SSR, Absamat Masaliyev. However, neither Jumagulov nor Masaliyev received a majority of the votes cast. In accordance with the Kirghiz SSR&#x27;s constitution of 1978, both candidates were disqualified and neither could run in the second round of voting.

Two days later, on 27 October, the Supreme Soviet selected Akayev who was effectively a compromise candidate to serve as the republic&#x27;s first president. In 1991, he was offered the post of vice-president of the Soviet Union by President Mikhail Gorbachev, but refused. Akayev was elected president of the renamed Republic of Kyrgyzstan in an uncontested poll on 12 October 1991. He was reelected twice, amid allegations of ballot rigging, on 24 December 1995 and 29 October 2000.

Akayev was initially seen as an economically right-wing liberal leader. He commented in a 1991 interview that &quot;Although I am a Communist, my basic attitude toward private property is favorable. I believe that the revolution in the sphere of economics was not made by Karl Marx but by Adam Smith.&quot; As late as 1993 political analysts saw Akayev as a &quot;prodemocratic physicist.&quot; He actively promoted privatization of land and other economic assets and operated a relatively liberal regime compared with the governments of the other Central Asian nations. In October 1991, he appointed Boris Birshtein, who is associated with the Zürich based Seabeco AG, as president of the country&#x27;s committee for reconstruction and development as well as the country&#x27;s trade representative and ensured that the Kirgiz branch of Seabeco would operate free of taxes. He was granted lifelong immunity from prosecution by the Lower House of Parliament in 2003.

Akayev was supportive of the Kyrgyzstani Neo-Tengrist movement.

==Protests==

The first wave of demonstrations took place in mid-March 2002. Azimbek Beknazarov, a member of parliament accused of abuse of power, was due to attend trial taking place in Jalal-Abad. Over 2,000 demonstrators marched on the town where the proceedings were to take place. According to eyewitnesses, police ordered the demonstrators to stop and gave them fifteen minutes to disperse, yet opened fire before this time elapsed. Five men were shot dead; another was killed on the next day. 61 people were injured, including 47 police and 14 civilians.

Riot police clashed with protesters in Bishkek in May during demonstrations in support of Beknazarov. Police in the capital&#x27;s Parliament square kicked protesters and dragged people away to break up the 200-strong crowd. They made several demands including the resignation of Akayev. This was again repeated in November of the same year when scores were arrested as the opposition marched on the capital. Protests continued, albeit on a smaller scale, at various points over the next few years.

==2005 election controversy==

Akayev had promised to step down from office when his third term expired in 2005, but the possibility of a dynastical succession had been raised. His son Aidar Akayev and his daughter Bermet Akayeva were candidates in the 2005 legislative election, and it was widely suspected that he was going to retain either &quot;de facto&quot; power by arranging for the election of a close supporter or relative, or perhaps even by abrogation of the term limit provision in the constitution and remaining in power personally, an allegation which he strongly denied.

The results of the elections were disputed, with allegations of vote-rigging. Two of Akayev&#x27;s children won seats. Serious protests broke out in Osh and Jalal-Abad, with protesters occupying administration buildings and the Osh airport. The government declared that it was ready to negotiate with the demonstrators. However an opposition leader said talks would only be worthwhile if the President himself took part.

Akayev refused to resign, but pledged not to use force to end the protests, which he attributed to foreign interests seeking to provoke a large-scale clamp-down in response.

On 23 March, Akayev announced the dismissal of Interior Minister Bakirdin Subanbekov and General Prosecutor Myktybek Abdyldayev for &quot;poor work&quot; in dealing with the growing protests.

==Downfall==
On 24 March 2005, protesters stormed the presidential compound in the central square of Bishkek and seized control of the seat of state power after clashing with riot police during a large opposition rally. Opposition supporters also seized control of key cities and towns in the south to press demands that Akayev step down.

That day, Akayev fled the country with his family, reportedly escaping first to Kazakhstan and then to Russia. Russian president Vladimir Putin invited Akayev to stay in Russia. There were early reports that he had tendered his resignation to opposition leaders before his departure. However, his formal resignation did not come until 4 April, when a delegation of members of parliament from Kyrgyzstan met him in Russia.

The Kyrgyz Parliament accepted the resignation on 11 April 2005, after stripping him and his family members of special privileges that had been granted to him by the previous parliament. He was also formally stripped of the title of &quot;First President of Kyrgyzstan&quot;.

==Current position and activities==

Akayev now works as Professor and Senior Researcher of Prigogine Institute for Mathematical Investigations of Complex Systems at Moscow State University. Together with Andrey Korotayev and George Malinetsky he is a coordinator of the Russian Academy of Sciences Program &quot;System Analysis and Mathematical Modeling of World Dynamics&quot;. He is also Academic Supervisor of the Centre for Stability and Risk Analysis at the HSE University in Moscow.

In July 2021, Akayev was put on a wanted list for his involvement in operations at the Kumtor Gold Mine. The following month, Akayev returned to Bishkek for the first time in 16 years in order to cooperate with the investigation, expressing his appreciation to President Sadyr Japarov for allowing him to return. In December 2021, the criminal prosecution was discontinued.

In the 2022 Kyrgyzstan–Tajikistan clashes, Akayev commented on Tajikistan&#x27;s invasion of Kyrgyz territory. Accusing Emomali Rahmon of a carefully planned and pre-planned act of aggression, Akaev called Rahmon ungrateful and recalled that 30 years ago, during the civil war in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan provided &quot;the greatest help and political, moral and humanitarian support to the brotherly people of Tajikistan.&quot;.

In August 2023, Akaev, in an interview with the Russian television channel RT, stated that Kyrgyzstan &quot;should support Russia&quot; in the invasion of Ukraine. So he answered the journalist&#x27;s question about the fact that citizens who participated in the hostilities in Ukraine on the side of Russia were convicted in Kyrgyzstan, and what Akaev thinks about this. “I didn’t understand the details of this, but I want to say that Kyrgyzstan, as an ally of Russia, and as a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, and a member of the CSTO, of course, must support Russia. And Russia needs it today. It is in such difficult days that an ally is known, ”he said.

<doc id="392443" wikidata="Q207942" url="?curid=392443" title="Sani Abacha">
<text>Sani Abacha (; (20 September 1943 – 8 June 1998) was a Nigerian military dictator and statesman who ruled Nigeria with an iron-fist as military head of state from 1993 following a palace coup d&#x27;état until his death in 1998.

Abacha&#x27;s seizure of power was the last successful coup d&#x27;état in Nigerian military history. He wielded power with an unyielding attitude and his rule heralded an unprecedented total disregard for human rights with several political assassinations and summary executions of dissidents and political opponents in Nigeria. His rule drew disrepute to the country with Nigeria becoming a pariah state in international relations particularly with regards to the execution of environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.

Sani Abacha was considered one of the twentieth century&#x27;s most corrupt dictators and as a kleptocrat for the alleged embezzlement of US$2–5 billion. Abacha, and his family, allegedly hid most of the loot abroad in Switzerland, as well as in other jurisdictions including Liechtenstein, the United Kingdom and the United States. Abacha&#x27;s death on 8 June 1998 brought about the Nigerian Fourth Republic a year later and he was succeeded as Nigeria&#x27;s head of state by General Abdulsalami Abubakar.

==Early life==
Abacha was born and brought up in Kano to a Kanuri family originally from present-day Borno State. He attended the Nigerian Military Training College in Kaduna, and was commissioned in 1963 after he had attended the Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot, England.

==Military career==
Abacha was definitely involved in all the military coups in Nigeria since July 1966 during his military career. In 1966, when he was still a second lieutenant with the 3rd Battalion in Kaduna, he took part in the July 1966 Nigerian counter-coup from the conceptual stage. He could well have been a participant in the Lagos or Abeokuta phases of the coup the previous January as well. In 1969, he fought during the Nigerian Civil War as a platoon and battalion commander. He later became commander of the 2nd Infantry Division in 1975. In 1983, Abacha was general officer commanding of the 2nd Mechanised Division, and was appointed a member of the Supreme Military Council.

In the same year, Abacha played a prominent role in the 1983 Nigerian coup d&#x27;état which brought General Muhammadu Buhari to power; and the 1985 Nigerian coup d&#x27;état which removed Buhari and brought General Ibrahim Babangida to power. When General Ibrahim Babangida was named President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 1985, Abacha was named Chief of Army Staff. He was later appointed Minister of Defence in 1990.

Abacha served as Chief of Army Staff from 1985 to 1990, as Chief of Defence Staff from 1990 to 1993, and as Minister of Defence. Abacha is noted for having been the first Nigerian Army officer to attain the rank of general without skipping a single rank.

== Seizure of power ==
Abacha was the defence minister and most senior official within the military hierarchy during the crisis of the Third Republic. He orchestrated the coup d&#x27;état of 1993 which overthrew the Interim National Government of Ernest Shonekan. In his nationwide broadcast, Abacha portrayed the overthrow as an act of stability brought about through the socio-political uncertainties caused by the 1993 presidential election.

== Head of state ==
Abacha ruled as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria from 1993 to 1998. In September 1994, he issued a decree that placed his government above the jurisdiction of the courts effectively giving him absolute power. Another decree gave him the right to detain anyone for up to three months without trial. He further abrogated Decree 691 of 1993.

=== Regime maintenance ===
Abacha assembled a personal security force of 3,000 men trained in North Korea. Abacha&#x27;s chief security officer Hamza al-Mustapha had an iron grip on the apparatus of military security. The Nigeria Police Force underwent a large-scale retraining. The state cracked down ruthlessly on criminals and dissidents, the National Democratic Coalition was charged with responsibility for a number of bombings across the country, and several of its members were arrested. When Moshood Abiola proclaimed himself president, he was jailed for treason and subsequently died in custody. Also, former military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo was jailed for treason and accused of plotting a coup together with General Oladipo Diya. In 1997, General Shehu Yar&#x27;Adua who was also jailed died in custody. Abacha&#x27;s regime was accused of human rights abuses, especially after the hanging of Ogoni activist Ken Saro-Wiwa (only one of several executions of Ogoni activists opposed to the exploitation of Nigerian resources by the multinational petroleum company, Royal Dutch Shell), whose death later led to the eviction of Nigeria from the Commonwealth Nations. Wole Soyinka was charged in absentia with treason. Abacha&#x27;s regime suffered opposition externally by pro-democracy activists.

=== National economy ===
Abacha&#x27;s administration oversaw an increase in the country&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves from $494 million in 1993 to $9.6 billion by the middle of 1997, and reduced the external debt of Nigeria from $36 billion in 1993 to $27 billion by 1997. Abacha also constructed between 25 and 100 km of urban road in major cities such as Kano, Gusau, Benin, Funtua, Zaria, Enugu, Kaduna, Aba, Lagos, Lokoja and Port Harcourt. Abacha brought the privatisation programs of the Ibrahim Babangida administration to a halt, reduced an inflation rate of 54% inherited from Ernest Shonekan to 8.5% between 1993 and 1998, all while the nation&#x27;s primary commodity, oil was at an average of $15 per barrel. GDP growth, despite being estimated to be higher than the 2.2% growth in 1995, was largely limited to the petroleum sector.

=== Embezzlement of state funds ===
The unprecedented economic achievements coincided with the rapid expansion of embezzlement hitherto unseen in the history of corruption in Nigeria in the alleged saga known as &quot;Abacha loot&quot;. Abacha&#x27;s national security adviser, Alhaji Ismaila Gwarzo, was accused by the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo to have played a central role in the looting and transfer of money to overseas accounts. Abacha&#x27;s son, Mohammed Abacha and best friend Alhaji Mohammed M. Sada were also involved. A preliminary report published by the Abdulsalam Abubakar transitional government in November 1998 described the process. The report mentioned that Sani Abacha told Ismaila Gwarzo to provide fake national security funding requests, which Abacha approved. The funds were usually sent in cash or traveller&#x27;s cheques by the Central Bank of Nigeria to Gwarzo, who took them to Abacha&#x27;s house. Mohammed Sada then arranged to launder the money to offshore accounts. An estimated $1.4 billion in cash was delivered in this way.

In 2004, a list of the ten most self-enriching leaders in the previous two decades was released; in order of amount allegedly stolen, the fourth-ranked of these leaders was Abacha and his family who are alleged to have embezzled between $1 billion – $5 billion. In 2002, rumours circulated that Abacha&#x27;s family purportedly agreed to return $1.2 billion. Sources in the Obasanjo administration disclosed that the whole Abacha loot was politicised by the administration for his re-election bid. On 7 August 2014, the United States Department of Justice announced the forfeiture of US$480 million, the largest in its history, to the Nigerian government. Jersey discovered more than $267 million in funds that were allegedly laundered through the U.S. banking system and deposited in a Jersey account (£210m in British pounds). In 2019, more than 20 years after his death the U.S. Justice Department, Jersey courts and the government of Nigeria completed a civil asset forfeiture against the funds and they will be divided between those countries.

Abacha oversaw the re-organisation of Nigeria into six geopolitical zones, in order to reflect cultural, economic, and political realities of the regions:

* North Central: Benue State, Kogi State, Kwara State, Nasarawa State, Niger State, Plateau State and Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria.
* North East: Adamawa State, Bauchi State, Borno State, Gombe State, Taraba State and Yobe State.
* North West: Jigawa State, Kaduna State, Kano State, Katsina State, Kebbi State, Sokoto State and Zamfara State.
* South East: Abia State, Anambra State, Ebonyi State, Enugu State and Imo State.
* South South: Akwa Ibom State, Bayelsa State, Cross River State, Delta State, Edo State and Rivers State.
* South West: Ekiti State, Lagos State, Ogun State, Ondo State, Osun State and Oyo State.
*

This was achieved after adding six states to the already existing 30 to make up the present 36 states in the country.

Abacha held a constitutional conference between 1993 and 1995. Early in 1998, Abacha announced that elections would be held on 1 August, with a view toward handing power to a civilian government on 1 October. It later became apparent that Abacha had no intention of relinquishing power. By April 1998, Abacha had coerced the country&#x27;s five political parties into endorsing him as the sole presidential candidate.

=== Foreign policy ===
In 1995, following the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa, Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations. While hosting Nelson Mandela, Abacha admitted he was advised against interfering with Saro-Wiwa&#x27;s trial—but made assurances that he would use his rank in government to commute the sentence if death sentence was pronounced. Justice Ibrahim Auta was the judge presiding over the proceedings and sentenced Saro-Wiwa to death by hanging. Abacha did not commute the sentence.

In 1997, Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s West African Tour to Sani Abacha to mark the new Islamic year directly infringed United Nations Sanctions on Libya, yet he was greeted by thousands of Abacha&#x27;s supporters who came out to demonstrate their loyalty in Kano. The Libyan leader sought to strengthen relations with the country, as a way to strengthen his agenda of Pan-Africanism.

Abacha intervened in the Liberian Civil War. Through the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group, Abacha sent troops to Liberia to fight against the rising insurgency in the country. The Civil War, which began in 1989, saw an influx of Nigerian troops from 1990 when Abacha was defence minister.

Despite being repeatedly condemned by the US State Department, Abacha did have a few ties to American politicians. In 1997, Senator James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) travelled to Nigeria to meet with Abacha as a representative of the &quot;Family&quot;, a group of evangelical Christian politicians and civic leaders. Abacha and the Family had a business and political relationship from that point until his death. Abacha also developed ties with other American political figures such as Senator Carol Moseley Braun (D-Illinois) Rev. Jesse Jackson and Minister Louis Farrakhan. Several African American political leaders visited Nigeria during his reign and Farrakhan supported his administration.

== Personal life and death==
Abacha was married to Maryam Abacha and had seven sons and three daughters. As of 2018, he had thirty-three grandchildren.

The scars on his face were tribal markings.

On Monday 8 June 1998, Abacha died in the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja. He was buried on the same day according to Muslim tradition and without an autopsy, fuelling speculation that he may have been assassinated. The government identified the cause of death as a sudden heart attack. It is believed by foreign diplomats, including United States intelligence analysts, that he may have been poisoned while in the company of prostitutes. His chief security officer, Hamza al-Mustapha, believed he was poisoned by Israeli operatives in the company of Yasser Arafat. At the time of his death, he was allegedly about to transfer power to a civilian government in October 1998, implemented in October 1995. After Abacha&#x27;s death, General Abdulsalami Abubakar became head of state, whose short tenure ushered in the Fourth Nigerian Republic.

<text>General Khamtai Siphandone (; born 8 February 1924) is a Laotian politician who was Chairman of the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party from 24 November 1992 to 21 March 2006 and President of Laos from 24 February 1998 to 8 June 2006, when he was replaced by Choummaly Sayasone. He was a member of the Communist Party of Indochina in 1954 and a member of the Central Committee of the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party in 1956.

==Early life==
Siphandone was born on 8 February 1924. He comes from a peasant family from the far south of Laos. His first job was as a postman. He joined the national liberation movement Lao Issara after the end of the Second World War, which stood for the independence of Laos and against the return of the French protectorate administration. Before the French regained control of Savannakhet in March 1946, Siphandone seized the entire provincial fund (150,000 piastres). He became an officer of the armed wing of the movement and in 1948 their representative for southern Laos. After the split of Lao Issara in 1950 he joined the Viet Minh-backed Pathet Lao.

In 1954 he became a member of the Communist Party of Indochina, and in 1955 the Lao People&#x27;s Party, whose central committee he was from 1957. He was considered a close confidant of the first Secretary-General Kaysone Phomvihane. In 1962 he became his successor as chief of staff of the armed units of the Pathet Lao. In 1966 he became commander-in-chief of the resulting &quot;Lao People&#x27;s Liberation Army&quot;, which fought with North Vietnamese support, in the Laotian Civil War against the royal troops. In 1972 he rose to the Politburo of the LPRP.

==Political career==
Siphandone was the military commander of the Pathet Lao rebellion. After the successful Communist takeover in 1975, he became the Minister of Defense and a deputy prime minister of Laos. During the 5th Party Congress in 1991, Siphandone was the third highest-ranking member of the party leadership, after Kaysone Phomvihane and Nouhak Phoumsavanh. On 15 August 1991, he succeeded Kaysone as Prime Minister of Laos, who had left office to become president. After the death of longtime party leader Kaysone in 1992, Siphandone became Chairman of the Lao People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party.

Siphandone succeeded Nouhak Phoumsavanh as president in 1998. At the 8th Party Congress in 2006, he became an advisor to the LPRP Central Committee.

Siphandone remained as party leader until 21 March 2006, when he was replaced by Choummaly. He stepped down as president in June, following the 2006 Laotian parliamentary election.

==Family and personal life==
Siphandone is married to Thongvanh Siphandone. His son Sonexay joined the LPRP Politburo in 2016 and became Prime Minister of Laos in 2022. His daughter Viengthong currently serves as President of the State Audit Organization.

On 8 February 2024, he turned 100, and was sent congratulatory messages by General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam Nguyễn Phú Trọng and President of Vietnam Võ Văn Thưởng. The Vietnamese ambassador to Laos Nguyen Ba Hung presented a birthday gift to Siphandone to his son Sonexay.

==Awards and honors==
** National Gold Medal
** Order of Phoxay Lane Xang
** Family Order of Laila Utama (2004)
** Gold Star Order
** Order of the Red Banner (1984)

<doc id="392453" wikidata="Q960892" url="?curid=392453" title="Obafemi Awolowo">
<text>Obafemi Jeremiah Oyeniyi Awolowo (6 May 1909 – 9 May 1987) was a Nigerian politician who served as the first Prime Minister of Nigeria. He was known as one of the key figure towards Nigeria&#x27;s independence movement from 1957 to 1960. Awolowo founded the Yoruba nationalist group Egbe Omo Oduduwa as well as the Premier of the Western Region under Nigeria&#x27;s parliamentary system from 1952 to 1959. He was the official opposition leader in the federal parliament to the Balewa government from 1959 to 1963.

As a young man he was an active journalist, editing publications such as the Nigerian Worker and the African Sentinel, on top of others as well. He later became founder and publisher of Nigerian Tribune of African Newspapers of Nigeria Ltd. After receiving his bachelor of commerce degree in Nigeria, he traveled to London to pursue his degree in law. Obafemi Awolowo was the first premier of the Western Region and later federal commissioner for finance, and vice chairman of the Federal Executive Council during the Nigerian Civil War. He was thrice a major contender for the country&#x27;s highest office.

A native of Ikenne in Ogun State of south-western Nigeria, Awolowo started his career, like some of his well-known contemporaries, as a nationalist in the Nigerian Youth Movement in which he rose to become Western Provincial Secretary. Awolowo was responsible for much of the progressive social legislation that has made Nigeria a modern nation. In 1963, he was tried and jailed for 10 years on charges of sedition. He was pardoned by the government in 1966, after which he appointed the Minister of Finance. In recognition of all of this, Awolowo was the first individual in the modern era to be named as the leader of the Yorubas (Yoruba: &quot;Asíwájú Àwọn Yorùbá&quot; or &quot;Asíwájú Ọmọ Oòduà&quot;).

==Early life==
Obafemi Awolowo, SAN, GCFR was born Jeremiah Obafemi Oyeniyi Awolowo on 6 March 1909 in the Remo town of Ikenne (present-day Ogun State of Nigeria). He was the only son of David Shopolu Awolowo, a farmer and sawyer, and Mary Efunyela Awolowo. He had two sisters and one maternal half-sister. Awolowo&#x27;s father was born to a high chief and member of the Iwarefa, the leading faction of the traditional Osugbo group that ruled Ikenne.

In 1896, Awolowo&#x27;s father became one of the first Ikenne natives to convert to Christianity. Awolowo&#x27;s paternal grandmother, Adefule Awolowo, whom Awolowo adored, was a devout worshipper of the Ifá. Adefule, Awolowo&#x27;s grandmother, believed that Obafemi was a reincarnation of her father (his great-grandfather). Awolowo&#x27;s father&#x27;s conversion to Christianity often went at odds with his family&#x27;s beliefs. He often challenged worshippers of the god of smallpox, Obaluaye. His father ultimately died on April 8, 1920, of smallpox when Obafemi was about eleven years old.

He attended various schools, including Baptist Boys&#x27; High School (BBHS), Abeokuta; and then became a teacher in Abeokuta, after which he qualified as a shorthand typist. Subsequently, he served as a clerk at the Wesley College Ibadan, as well as a correspondent for the &quot;Nigerian Times&quot;.

Following his education at Wesley College, Ibadan, in 1927, he enrolled at the University of London as an External Student and graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Commerce (Hons.). He went to the UK in 1944 to study law at the University of London and was called to the Bar by the Honorable Society of the Inner Temple on 19 November 1946. In 1949, Awolowo founded the &quot;Nigerian Tribune&quot;, a private Nigerian newspaper, which he used to spread nationalist consciousness among Nigerians.

==Politics==
In 1945, he attended the fifth Pan-African Congress in Manchester as a representative of the Nigerian Youth Movement along with H. O. Davies. Also attending was an illustrious list of participants which included Kwame Nkrumah, Hastings Banda, Jomo Kenyatta and Jaja Wachuku, among others.

=== As Premier ===
Awolowo was Nigeria&#x27;s foremost federalist. In his &quot;Path to Nigerian Freedom&quot; (1947), the first systematic federalist manifesto by a Nigerian politician, he advocated federalism as the only basis for equitable national integration and, as head of the Action Group, he led demands for a federal constitution, which was introduced in the 1954 Lyttleton Constitution, following primarily the model proposed by the Western Region delegation led by him. He was also a keen advocate of minority rights and the relocation of the Federal Capital away from Lagos, advocating for Lagos rights to be governed by the Western region of largely Yoruba stock.

As premier, he proved to be and was viewed as a man of vision and a dynamic administrator. Awolowo was also the country&#x27;s leading social democratic politician. He supported limited public ownership and limited central planning in government. He believed that the state should channel Nigeria&#x27;s resources into education and state-led infrastructural development. Controversially, and at considerable expense, he introduced free primary education for all and free health care for children in the Western Region, established the first television service in Africa in 1959, and the Oduduwa Group, all of which were financed from the highly lucrative cocoa industry which was the mainstay of the regional economy.

His Valedictory Speech on 3 November 1959 to the Western Region House of Assembly recounting his achievements in office between 1952 and 1959, provides context to his work ethic and achievements as an administrator.

===In opposition===
From the eve of independence, he led the Action Group as the Leader of the Opposition in the federal parliament, leaving Samuel Ladoke Akintola as the Western Region Premier. Disagreements between Awolowo and Akintola on how to run the Western region led the latter to an alliance with the Tafawa Balewa-led NPC federal government. A constitutional crisis led to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Western Region, eventually resulting in a widespread breakdown of law and order.

Excluded from national government, Awolowo and his party faced an increasingly precarious position. Akintola&#x27;s followers, angered at their exclusion from power, formed the Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP) under Akintola&#x27;s leadership. Having previously suspended the elected Western Regional Assembly, the federal government then reconstituted the body after manoeuvres that brought Akintola&#x27;s NNDP into power without an election. Shortly afterwards Awolowo and several disciples were arrested, charged, convicted (of treason), and jailed under Balewa for conspiring with the Ghanaian authorities to overthrow the federal government.

=== As National Leader ===
By 1966, he was released and pardoned by the government, after which he assumed the position of Minister of Finance. From this position, he helped negotiate the joint venture rights of Nigeria in its new oil find, ushering in a decade of oil boom and providing the bulwark of national wealth. He also helped developed the system of national revenue sharing and fiscal allocation (FAAC), which enabled newly created states that boosted minority rights to thrive and survive to this day. He is also credited with naming the new national currency, the NIGERIAN NAIRA introduced under his leadership.

Regarding the blockade of Biafra during which more than 1 million Igbo children died of starvation, Awolowo was quoted as saying, &quot;All is fair in war, and starvation is one of the weapons of war. I don’t see why we should feed our enemies fat, only to fight us harder.&quot;

=== As Presidential Candidate ===

In 1979 and 1983, he contested under the Unity Party&#x27;s platform as a presidential candidate, but lost to the northern-based National Party of Shehu Shagari. In 1979, he contested his loss in court, making a case for electoral college decision because the winning candidate couldn&#x27;t have said to have won having not fulfilled the majority in 2/3 of states (then 19) which led to the landmark Supreme Court decision of 1979 with Chief Justice Fatai Williams presiding.

== Legacy ==
In 1992, the Obafemi Awolowo Foundation was founded as an independent, non-profit, non-partisan organisation committed to furthering the symbiotic interaction of public policy and relevant scholarship with a view to promoting the overall development of the Nigerian nation. The Foundation was launched by the President of Nigeria at that time, General Ibrahim Babangida, at the Liberty Stadium, Ibadan. 
However, his most important bequests (styled Awoism) are his exemplary integrity, his welfarism, his contributions to hastening the process of decolonisation and his consistent and reasoned advocacy of federalism-based on ethno-linguistic self-determination and uniting politically strong states-as the best basis for Nigerian unity. Awolowo died peacefully at his Ikenne home, the Efunyela Hall (so named after his mother), on 9 May 1987, at the age of 78 and was laid to rest in Ikenne, amid tributes across political and ethno-religious divides.

== Personal Life ==
Awolowo married Hannah Idowu Dideolu Adelana, also from Ikenne, on 26 December 1937. They had five children, Olusegun Awolowo (1938-1963), (father of Segun Awolowo), Omotola Oyediran (née Awolowo) (1940-2020), Oluwole Awolowo (1943-2013), Ayodele Soyode (née Awolowo) (1944-2011), mother of former Second Lady of Nigeria Dolapo Osinbajo, and Tokunbo Awolowo-Dosunmu (1948).

==Honours==
He is featured in the 100 Naira banknote since 1999.

In addition to a variety of other chieftaincy titles, Chief Awolowo held the title of the Odole Oodua of Ile-Ife.

<text>Paul Raymond Bérenger (born 26 March 1945) is a Mauritian politician who was Prime Minister of Mauritius from 2003 to 2005. He has been Leader of the Opposition on several occasions – from 1983 to 1987, 1997 to 2000, 2005 to 2006, 2007 to 2013, October 2013 to 15 September 2014, and again from December 2014 to December 2016 when he was replaced by Xavier-Luc Duval. Following his party&#x27;s defeat in the 2014 general elections, he became Leader of the Opposition for the sixth time, making him the longest ever to serve in this constitutional position. He was also deputy prime minister from 1995 to 1997 and again from 2000 to 2003, and he was a cabinet minister in the government of Anerood Jugnauth in 1982 and 1991. Bérenger, a Christian of Franco-Mauritian descent, has been the only non-Hindu prime minister of Mauritius, or, more particularly, the only prime minister who has not belonged to the Jugnauth or Ramgoolam families.

==Early life, education and family==
Bérenger was born to Mauritian parents whose ancestors arrived in Mauritius from France in the 1700s. Geneviève Bérenger, his mother, was the daughter of Auguste Esnouf, an engineer and author who used pen name &quot;Savinien Mérédac&quot; to write novels and newspaper articles. He completed his secondary schooling at the College du St Esprit in Quatre Bornes. He travelled to the UK to study Philosophy and French, attended the Sorbonne in Paris and graduated from the Bangor University with a BA Hons in philosophy and French. He later worked as a Trade Unionist from 1970 to 1982 and was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the first time in December 1976.

== Political career ==
Bérenger founded the Mauritian Militant Movement in 1969 along with Dev Virahsawmy and the Jeerooburkhan brothers. This party has always received more than 40% of direct votes in general elections.

===1976 general elections===

Paul Bérenger was elected in Constituency No. 18 (Belle Rose and Quatre Bornes) at the December 1976 elections. The remaining 2 seats were secured by Independence Party (Labour-CAM) candidates James Burty david and Heeralall Bhugaloo. The general elections of 1976 turned out to be a three-way contest between the Independence Party (Labour-CAM coalition), the Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate (PMSD), and the MMM. There was a hung parliament, with 34 of the 70 seats in the National Assembly going to the MMM, 28 seats to the Labour Party, and 8 seats to the PMSD. Ramgoolam remained in office, however, by forging a coalition with the PMSD for a bare majority. Anerood Jugnauth was appointed Leader of the Opposition.

===1982 general elections===

At the June 1982 general elections Paul Bérenger was elected in Constituency No. 18 (Belle Rose and Quatre Bornes) at the top of the list as a candidate of the MMM-PSM coalition. His running mates Kailash Ruhee and Devanand Routho secured the remaining seats in that constituency. The MMM won all 60 directly elected seats in the Legislative Assembly (except for two seats allocated to Rodrigues Island). Anerood Jugnauth became prime minister, Harish Boodhoo was appointed as deputy prime minister. Bérenger became the Minister of Finance.

In early 1983, Bérenger proposed a constitutional amendment removing the executive powers of the prime minister and entrusting them to the Cabinet collectively. In this he was supported by Harish Boodhoo, but Jugnauth strongly objected. Bérenger then sought a parliamentary motion of no confidence to have Jugnauth replaced as prime minister by Prem Nababsing. Before the Legislative Assembly could vote on the matter, however, Jugnauth dissolved Parliament without any notice and called for new elections in August 1983.

===1983 general elections===

At the August 1983 general elections Paul Bérenger stood as candidate of the MMM in Constituency No. 18 (Belle Rose and Quatre Bornes). But this time he was not elected whilst his rivals Michael Glover, Anil Gayan and Raj Virahsawmy of the MSM-Labour coalition were elected in that constituency.

===1987 general elections===

Bérenger was once again candidate of the MMM in Constituency No. 18 (Belle Rose and Quatre Bornes) but he was not elected. His rivals of the MSM-Labour coalition (Michael Glover, Balkrishn Gokulsing and Raj Virahsawmy) were elected to the Legislative Assembly.

===1991 general elections===

At the August 1991 general elections Bérenger was elected to the Legislative Assembly under the MSM-MMM coalition in Constituency No. 19 (Stanley and Rose Hill) behind his running mates Jayen Cuttaree and Jean Claude de L&#x27;Estrac.

On 18 August 1993, Jugnauth dismissed Bérenger and all Members of the MMM from the government and formed a new majority with the other parties.

===1995 by elections===
In January 1995 Bérenger and Jean Claude de L&#x27;Estrac resigned from parliament, triggering by-elections in Constituency No.19. Bérenger was elected under the banner of the Labour-MMM coalition.

===1995 general elections===
As a candidate of the Labour-MMM coalition Bérenger was elected in Constituency No. 19 (Stanley and Rose Hill) at the December 1995 elections, ahead of his running mates Siddick Chady and Jayen Cuttaree. This alliance won the 1995 elections with a 60-nil sweep of mainland Mauritian constituencies. Ramgoolam became prime minister with Bérenger as his deputy. On 20 June 1997, however, Ramgoolam dismissed Bérenger and formed a new government without the MMM.

===2000 elections===

In 1999, the national opinion polls showed that Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam&#x27;s Labour Party was the favorite to win the elections due in 2000. In an hour-long meeting organized by Bodhoo, Berenger made up his quarrel with Jugnauth and agreed to an electoral alliance and a power-sharing deal, should they win the election. The MSM and the MMM would each contest 30 of the 60 mainland seats. If successful, Jugnauth would serve as prime minister for three years; he would then resign, assume the (largely, but not entirely, ceremonial) office of President of Mauritius and make way for Bérenger to succeed him as prime minister, with Jugnauth&#x27;s son Pravind Jugnauth as his deputy.

The MSM/MMM alliance won 54 of the 60 seats. Jugnauth became prime minister again, appointing a 25-member Cabinet with Bérenger as deputy prime minister.

The power-sharing agreement was briefly in doubt when, in 2001, Bérenger faced a charge of aiding and abetting a murder suspect to escape arrest. Swaleha Joomun, a widow, was suing the deputy premier for facilitating the escape of Bissessur who was wanted in connection with a triple murder which occurred on 26 October 1996 in Port Louis. Joomun&#x27;s husband was a victim of the murder. Bérenger defended himself by saying that the reason he had helped Bissessur was because the latter wanted to reveal what he knew on the &quot;escadron de la mort (death squad)&quot;. A second private prosecution was lodged against Bérenger by Raju Mohit (a member of the Movement Republicain) but in both cases, the Director of Public Prosecutions of Mauritius gave a Nolle Prosequi.

In 2003, Bérenger duly succeeded Jugnauth, who assumed the presidency, as agreed.

===Prime minister===

In 2003, Berenger took office as prime minister following the resignation of then Prime Minister Jugnauth after serving as his deputy for three years. He led the MSM/MMM coalition government for a period of one year and nine months before his alliance lost the elections to the Labour Party in 2005. He was the first and only non-Hindu prime minister.

Paul Berenger remained Deputy Prime Minister of Mauritius for three years and following the agreement, Anerood Jugnauth resigned in September 2003 after serving for three years.

===Leader of the Opposition===

Berenger subsequently tried to run on his own but lost the 2005 elections to Ramgoolam&#x27;s Labour Party

Paul Berenger has been the leader of the opposition since 2007 after the MMM lost the general elections in 2005 to the Alliance Sociale coalition led by Dr Navin Ramgoolam. The MMM also lost the subsequent elections in 2010.

In January 2013, Berenger announced that he had tonsil cancer in a press conference, and let the population know of his plans for treatment in France and that Alan Ganoo was to lead the MMM during his absence. Overall he appeared in good spirits and was confident of a return to mainstream politics. Different sources relayed by the lexpress.mu website also announced the entry into politics of his son, Emmanuel Bérenger. Following his successful treatment for cancer, he returned to his position as Leader of the Opposition on 1 October 2013.

After his party ended its coalition with the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM), Bérenger negotiated an alliance with the Labour Party on a power-sharing deal whereby each party would nominate 30 candidates and, if successful in the election, would provide an equal number of Cabinet Ministers. Navin Ramgoolam would remain prime minister until a new constitution could be adopted to enhance the powers of the President, before resigning to make place for Bérenger to succeed him. This alliance lost the December 2014 elections, however, and Sir Aneerood Jugnauth, who had come out of retirement to lead Alliance Lepep (Alliance of the People) was sworn in prime minister again, at the age of 84. In October 2019 Berenger went into the general elections with MMM not contracting any alliance with anyone. The MSM of Pravind Jugnauth won an overwhelming victory, although short of a three-quarter majority. Arvind Boolell of the Labour Party was appointed as leader of the opposition, as Navin Ramgoolam lost in his constituency. MMM managed to elect only nine MPs. Several petitions were lodged in the Supreme Court challenging the validity of the election results.

==Controversies==
===1971 Azor Adelaide murder===
In 1971 Bérenger narrowly escaped a murder attempt, whilst his assistant Azor Adelaide died soon after being shot by rival political activists on Chasteauneuf Street in Curepipe.

===1978 Affaire Sheik Hossen===
Following the building fire at the head office of newspaper &quot;Le Mauricien&quot; on 11 June 1978, the MMM&#x27;s propaganda paper &quot;Le Militant&quot; published a front-page article in which MMM activist Jean-Paul Sheik Hossen accused several members of the local intelligence police (Special Branch) to have planned the arson attack. Sheik Hossen made allegations against Special Branch&#x27;s director Fulena, his deputy Sénèque, officers Jean-Paul Venkatachellum and Jean Ramiah. Security guard Yves Bedos supported Sheik Hossen&#x27;s allegations. The Labour-PMSD-CAM government was alleged to be concerned by &quot;Le Mauricien&quot;&#x27;s adoption of the new offset printing technology which would strengthen Bérenger&#x27;s MMM. Under cover of parliamentary immunity Bérenger further reiterated the accusations against the intelligence police, which led to a lengthy investigation and court appearances. Bérenger eventually has to publicly apologise for having blindly believed in Sheik Hossen&#x27;s allegations.

===1982 Microphone snatching incident===
In 1982, although Anerood Jugnauth was his superior in the hierarchy of the MMM and short-term government, Paul Bérenger snatched the microphone off Jugnauth at a public appearance. This incident infuriated the witnesses from within the party as it confirmed Bérenger&#x27;s lack of respect for others as well as his unpredictable nature.

===1983 Coup d&#x27;État and Operation Lal Dora===
In 1983 a military intervention in Mauritius by India, code named Operation Lal Dora, nearly occurred after the official leader of the new MMM-PSM government (PM Anerood Jugnauth) had alerted Indian PM Indira Gandhi of an imminent coup d&#x27;état, which would be led by his deputy prime minister Paul Bérenger.

===2001 Illovo Deal for Franco-Mauritian companies===
The 2001 Illovo Deal, which Bérenger labelled as &quot;mari deal&quot; (literally meaning &quot;amazing deal&quot;) has been criticized to have favoured a small number of elite Franco-Mauritian capitalists, to the detriment of the rest of the Mauritian population, especially the small planters. Bérenger formed part of the government at the time of the Illovo Deal, and his adviser and broker Jean-Mée Desvaux negotiated with Anerood Jugnauth at the latter&#x27;s office in order for the elite Franco-Mauritian conglomerate to pocket Rs 6 Billion whilst the State would only receive Rs 3 Billion of the deal involving the sale of more than 10,000 arpents of agricultural land. Prior to the Desvaux-Jugnauth meeting the Rs 6 Billion worth of land would have been acquired by the State (to be on sold and distributed to interested small planters).

===2008 sexist insults towards women===
As Leader of the Opposition Paul Bérenger showed disrespect towards women when he publicly insulted Nita Deerpalsing during a session of the National Assembly in August 2008. In response to MP Nita Deerpalsing&#x27;s expression of support for then Attorney General Rama Valayden Bérenger commented &quot;rode ene mari pou li marié do!&quot; (meaning &quot;go find her a husband so she can finally get married&quot;). Paul Bérenger&#x27;s loyal acolyte Rajesh Bhagwan defended Bérenger&#x27;s insults on the basis that he had been upset by so much support for his opponent Rama Valayden.

===2017 insults within the parliament===
During debates about the need for electoral reforms and the financing of political parties in the National Assembly, Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth highlighted Bérenger&#x27;s and the MMM&#x27;s lack of experience in governing the country and their inability to make legal reforms. Bérenger&#x27;s acolyte Rajesh Bhagwan also joined in the exchange of verbal insults and Paul Bérenger&#x27;s old nickname &quot;Requin moustache&quot; or &quot;Rekin Moustass&quot; (literally meaning &quot;shark with a moustache&quot;) made headlines in the local press.

===2020 St Louis Gate bribery===
Following an investigation by financier African Development Bank (ADB), Paul Bérenger was named as one of the recipients of bribes via local company PAD &amp; Co. Ltd. on behalf of Danish firm Burmeister &amp; Wain Scandinavian Contractor (BWSC), which won the contract for the major upgrade of ailing St Louis diesel power station. The scandal became known as St Louis gate.

<text>Sir William Alexander Clarke Bustamante (born William Alexander Clarke; 24 February 1884 – 6 August 1977) was a Jamaican politician and labour leader, who, in 1962, became the first prime minister of Jamaica.

==Early life and education==
He was born to Mary Clarke (née Wilson), a woman of mixed race, and her husband, Robert Constantine Clarke, the son of Robert Clarke, a White Irish Catholic planter, in Blenheim, Hanover. His grandmother, Elsie Clarke-Shearer, was also the grandmother of Norman Washington Manley.

William said that he took the surname Bustamante to honour a Spanish sea captain who he claims adopted him in his early years and took him to Spain where he was sent to school and later returned to Jamaica.

However, Bustamante did not leave Jamaica until 1905, when he was 21 years old—and he left as part of the early Jamaican migration to Cuba, where employment opportunities were expanding in the sugar industry. He returned to Jamaica permanently about 30 years later in the 1930s.

Little is known about Bustamante&#x27;s 30 years spent outside of Jamaica.

==Political career in colonial Jamaica==

He became a leader in activism against colonial rule. He gained recognition by writing frequent letters on the issues to the &quot;Daily Gleaner&quot; newspaper. In 1937 he was elected as treasurer of the Jamaica Workers&#x27; Union (JWU), which had been founded by labour activist Allan G.S. Coombs. During the 1938 labour rebellion, he quickly became identified as the spokesman for striking workers, who were mostly of African and mixed-race descent. Coombs&#x27; JWU became the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (BITU) after the revolt, and Bustamante became known as &quot;The Chief &quot;.

In 1940, he was imprisoned on charges of subversive activities. The widespread anti-colonial activism finally resulted in Parliament&#x27;s granting universal suffrage in 1944 to residents in Jamaica. He was defended by N.W. Manley and released from prison in 1943, Bustamante founded the Jamaica Labour Party the same year. Previously he had belonged to the People&#x27;s National Party (founded in 1938 by his first cousin Norman Manley).

In the 1944 Jamaican general election, Bustamante&#x27;s party won 22 of 32 seats in the first House of Representatives elected by universal suffrage. He became the unofficial government leader, representing his party as Minister for Communications. Under the new charter, the British governor, assisted by the six-member Privy Council and ten-member Executive Council, remained responsible solely to the Crown. The Jamaican Legislative Council became the upper house, or Senate, of the bicameral Parliament. House members were elected by adult suffrage from single-member electoral districts called constituencies. Despite these changes, ultimate power remained concentrated in the hands of the governor and other high officials. He was acquitted. In 1952 he was arrested by the American authorities while he was on official business in Puerto Rico.

The 1949 Jamaican general election was much closer. The PNP received more votes (203,048) than the JLP (199,538), but the JLP secured more seats; 17 to the PNP&#x27;s 13. Two seats were won by independents. The voter turnout was 65.2%.

The parties lobbied the colonial government for a further increase in constitutional powers for the elected government, and in June 1953 a new constitution provided for the appointment of a chief minister and seven other Ministers from the elected House of Representatives. They now had a majority over the official and nominated members. For the first time, the Ministers could now exercise wide responsibility in the management of the internal affairs of the island. The only limits placed on their powers pertained to public security, public prosecutions and matters affecting members of the Civil Service, which still fell under the Colonial Secretary. In 1953, Bustamante became Jamaica&#x27;s first chief minister (the pre-independence title for head of government).

Bustamante held this position until the JLP was defeated in 1955. In the 1955 Jamaican general election, the PNP won for the first time, securing 18 out of 32 seats. The JLP ended up with 14 seats, and there were no independents. The voter turnout was 65.1%. As a result, Norman Manley became the new chief minister.

The 1959 Jamaican general election was held on 28 July 1959, and the number of seats was increased to 45. The PNP secured a wider margin of victory, taking 29 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 16.

Manley was appointed Jamaica&#x27;s first premier on 14 August 1959.
He served 4 years in office.

==Federation and independence==

Though initially a supporter of the Federation of the West Indies, during the 1950s, Bustamante gradually opposed the union. He agitated for Jamaica to become independent of Great Britain. He said that the JLP would not contest a by-election to the federal parliament.

In the 1961 Federation membership referendum Jamaica voted 54% to leave the West Indies Federation. After losing the referendum, Manley took Jamaica to the polls in April 1962, to secure a mandate for the island&#x27;s independence. On 10 April 1962, of the 45 seats up for contention in the 1962 Jamaican general election, the JLP won 26 seats and the PNP 19. The voter turnout was 72.9%.

This resulted in the independence of Jamaica on 6 August 1962, and several other British colonies in the West Indies followed suit in the next decade. Bustamante had replaced Manley as premier between April and August, and on independence, he became Jamaica&#x27;s first prime minister.

After Jamaica was granted independence in 1962, Bustamante served as the first Prime Minister until 1967. In April 1963 he ordered the police and army to &quot;Bring in all Rastas, dead or alive&quot; and over 150 Rastas were detained and an unknown number killed. In 1965, after suffering a stroke, he withdrew from active participation in public life. The true power was held by his deputy, Donald Sangster.

On 21 February, in the 1967 Jamaican general election, the JLP were victorious again, winning 33 out of 53 seats, with the PNP taking 20 seats. Two days later, Bustamante retired, and Sangster became Jamaica&#x27;s second prime minister.

==Marriage and family==
He was married four times. His fourth wife was Gladys Longbridge, who he married on 7 September 1962, at the age of 78. He had no children. His parents were Robert Constantine Clarke, and wife Mary née Wilson.

==Legacy and honours==

Bustamante was commended in 1955 for his public services in Jamaica. He was awarded an honorary LLD degree from the Fairfield University in 1963. In 1964, he was made a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom (PC). In 1966, an honorary LLD degree was conferred on him by the University of the West Indies. In the same year, he was also awarded the Special Grand Cordon of the Order of Brilliant Star by the Republic of China. On 9 June 1967, Bustamante was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE).

In 1969, Bustamante became a Member of the Order of National Hero (ONH) in recognition of his achievements, this along with Norman Manley, the black liberationist Marcus Garvey, and two leaders of the 1865 Morant Bay rebellion, Paul Bogle and George William Gordon. His portrait graces the Jamaican one dollar coin and one thousand dollar note, alongside Norman Manley.

Bustamante died in 1977 at the Irish Town Hospital and was buried in the National Heroes Park in Kingston.

==Bustamante backbone==

A Jamaican candy, the Bustamante backbone, is named after him. It is a grated coconut and dark brown sugar confection flavored with fresh grated ginger, cooked to a hard consistency, &quot;which is said to represent his firmness of character.&quot; Bustamante was considered a &quot;buster&quot;, &quot;a champion of the common man and tough article.&quot; The candy is also nicknamed Busta.

<text>Tubal Uriah &quot;Buzz&quot; Butler (21 January 1897 – 20 February 1977), was a Grenadian-born Spiritual Baptist preacher and labour leader in Trinidad and Tobago. He is best known for leading a series of labour riots between 19 June and 6 July 1937 and for forming a series of personalist political parties (the British Empire Citizens&#x27; and Workers&#x27; Home Rule Party, the Butler Home Rule Party, and finally the Butler Party) that focused its platform on the improvement of the working class.

==Biography==
Butler was born in St. George&#x27;s, Grenada, where he attended the Anglican School. Unable to find work after completing his primary school education, at 17 he became a volunteer in the British West Indies Regiment in World War I, serving in the British Army from 1914 to 1918, stationed in Egypt. Returning from military service at the end of the war in 1918, he became active in political pressure groups and workers unions, establishing the Grenada Representative Government Movement, and the Grenada Union of Returned Soldiers. In 1921, aged 24, he went to south Trinidad and was employed at the Roodal Oilfields as a pipe-fitter. He became influenced by the philosophy of Marcus Garvey, according to Garvey&#x27;s son Dr Julius Garvey.

Butler first came to prominence in 1935 when he led a &quot;hunger march&quot; from the oilfields to Port of Spain. In 1936 he was expelled from the Trinidad Labour Party for his &quot;extremist tendencies&quot;. He then formed the British Empire Citizens&#x27; and Workers&#x27; Home Rule Party. On 19 June 1937 a strike in protest of working conditions, wages, racism and exploitation began in the oilfields in the southern Trinidad. Police attempted to arrest Butler as he addressed a meeting in Fyzabad. His supporters prevented the police from doing so and Charlie King, a police officer was killed. The Labour riots of 1937 resulted in turmoil throughout the oilfields. When strikes spread to the sugar factories, the Colonial government responded by issuing an arrest warrant for Butler. Butler went into hiding and the colonial authorities were unable to locate him. He stayed in contact with the authorities through Adrian Cola Rienzi and although he was promised safe passage by the colonial authorities to testify at a commission of enquiry into the events of June 1937, he was arrested by the colonial government when he emerged to do so.

Butler was imprisoned from 9 September 1937 to May 1939. With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, he was re-arrested and detained for the duration of the war. After release from prison he formed the Butler Home Rule Party, which later became the Butler Party. The Butler Party captured the largest block of seats in the Legislative Council, but the Governor chose to exclude Butler and instead Albert Gomes became the first chief minister.

In the 1956 General Elections the Butler Party only won two seats. Butler, the fiery radical, was deemed too unstable and threatening to the nation&#x27;s economic well-being by Eric Williams and the People&#x27;s National Movement.

Butler is looked upon as the founding father of the Oilfields Workers&#x27; Trade Union (OWTU) and the labour movement and is honoured with a statue in Fyzabad. He was awarded the Trinity Cross, the nation&#x27;s highest honour, in 1970.

<doc id="392478" wikidata="Q447428" url="?curid=392478" title="Cerinthus">
<text>Cerinthus (; fl. c. 50-100 CE) was an early Gnostic, who was prominent as a heresiarch in the view of the early Church Fathers. Contrary to the Church Fathers, he used the Gospel of Cerinthus, and denied that the Supreme God made the physical world. In Cerinthus&#x27; interpretation, the Christ descended upon Jesus at baptism and guided him in ministry and the performing of miracles, but left him at the crucifixion. Similarly to the Ebionites, he maintained that Jesus was not born of a virgin, but was a mere man, the biological son of Mary and Joseph.

Early Christian tradition describes Cerinthus as a contemporary to and opponent of John the Evangelist, who may have written the First Epistle of John and the Second Epistle of John to warn the less mature in faith and doctrine about the changes Cerinthus was making to the original gospel. According to early Christian sources, the Apostle John wrote his gospel specifically to refute the teachings of Cerinthus.

All that is known about Cerinthus comes from the writing of his theological opponents.

==Biography==
Cerinthus flourished during the second half of the first century, though the date of his birth and his death are unknown. None of Cerinthus&#x27; actual writings seem to have survived. Our most detailed understanding of the man Cerinthus&#x27; teachings are from the 4th century Bishop Epiphanius of Salamis, a few centuries after his death, though Irenaeus of Lyon (c. 135–202) briefly outlines Cerinthus&#x27; beliefs in his five books against Gnosticism. Publication of surviving fragments of Hippolytus of Rome&#x27;s (c. 170–235) &quot;Capita Adversus Caium&quot; demonstrate Epiphanius drew heavily from Hippolytus&#x27; &quot;Refutation of the Thirty-two Heresies&quot;.

Irenaeus writes that Cerinthus was educated in the Gnosis of the Egyptians. According to Epiphanius, Cerinthus was the instigator of trouble against the Apostles Paul and Peter at Jerusalem, and had sent out men to Antioch commanding that gentile converts must be circumcised and keep the Law, prompting the convention of the Jerusalem Council (c. 50). After these things, Epiphanius says that Cerinthus founded a school in the Roman province of Asia Minor, which at its height spread into the province of Galatia. According to Galatian tradition, Paul wrote his epistle to the Galatians against Cerinthus&#x27; followers who were troubling the church.

In Asia, early Christian writers identify Cerinthus as an adversary of the Apostle John. According to Irenaeus, his teacher Polycarp, himself a student of John, told the story that John rushed out of a bathhouse at Ephesus without bathing when he found out Cerinthus was inside, exclaiming, &quot;Let us fly, lest even the bath-house fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is inside!&quot; Irenaeus also relates that John sought by proclamation of his gospel &quot;to remove that error which by Cerinthus had been disseminated among men&quot;.

==Beliefs==

We do not have a fully developed understanding of Cerinthus&#x27; teachings. The earliest surviving account of Cerinthus is that in Irenæus&#x27; refutation of Gnosticism, &quot;Adversus haereses&quot;, which was written about 170 AD. According to Irenæus, Cerinthus, a man educated in the wisdom of the Egyptians, claimed angelic inspiration.

The Epistula Apostolorum, a little-known 2nd-century text discovered in 1895, which is roughly contemporary (c. 160–170) with the above work of Irenaeus, was written polemically against the teachings of Cerinthus, beginning with an admonition to those who might follow the teachings of Simon and Cerinthus.

===Scripture===
Cerinthus utilized a gospel identical to that of the Ebionites, which the early church fathers identify as an unorthodox version of the Gospel of Matthew. Unlike Marcion of Sinope, a 2nd-century Gnostic who was hostile to the God of the Hebrews proclaimed in the Law and prophets, Cerinthus recognized Jewish scripture and professed to follow the God of the Hebrews, though Cerinthus denied that he made the world.

===Creation===
Cerinthus taught that the visible world and heavens were not made by the supreme being, but by a lesser power (Demiurge) distinct from him. He taught that this power was ignorant of the existence of the Supreme God.

His use of the term demiurge (literally, craftsman) for the creator fits Platonic, Neopythagorean, Middle Platonic, and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy, which dominated the learned environment of the eastern Mediterranean, see also Hellenistic Judaism. Unlike true Gnostics that followed him, Cerinthus taught that the demiurge was not evil, more like Philo&#x27;s logos than the egotistical demiurge taught by Valentinus.

===Jesus===
Cerinthus distinguished between the man Jesus and the Christ. He denied the supernatural virgin birth of Jesus, making him the biological son of Joseph and Mary, and taught that the Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler at baptism (see also Adoptionism) and left him again at his crucifixion—never to embody the flesh. Cerinthus is also said to have taught that Jesus will be raised from the dead at the Last Day, when all men will rise with him.

In describing Jesus as a natural-born man, Cerinthus agreed with the Ebionites. In portraying Christ as a spirit that came from heaven, undertook its divine task in the material world, and then returned, he anticipates the fully developed Christian Gnosticism in later decades. Irenaeus numbers Cerinthus among those Gnostics who denied that Jesus is the Logos (Word).

===Jewish law===

Cerinthus instructed his followers to maintain strict adherence to both Written and Oral Torah Mosaic law for the attainment of salvation. This soteriological worldview is termed legalism. This view contradicts the soteriology conveyed at the Council of Jerusalem (c. 50 AD), which gave the understanding that Christians are not required to be circumcised to attain salvation. The Book of Acts chapter lists only four lifestyle requirements for Gentile converts to Christianity for the purpose of their attending synagogue, after which they would learn the law of Moses as it was preached every Shabbat (Acts 15:21). Many scholars see these four requirements set out by the Jerusalem Council as a parallel to Noahide Law. Conversely, certain Jewish Christian sects, including the Cerinthians, recognized Mosaic law as both practicable and necessary.

===Eschatology===
Eusebius of Caesarea, in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, relates how, according to Caius of Rome, Cerinthus...by means of revelations which he pretends were written by a great apostle, brings before us marvelous things which he falsely claims were shown him by angels; and he says that after the resurrection the kingdom of Christ will be set up on earth, and that the flesh dwelling in Jerusalem will again be subject to desires and pleasures. And being an enemy of the Scriptures of God, he asserts, with the purpose of deceiving men, that there is to be a period of a thousand years for marriage festivals.It is, however, improbable that this statement is true of Cerinthus&#x27; beliefs. Caius of Rome is identified with those whom Epiphanius of Salamis styles the &quot;Alogi&quot;, who, &quot;refusing to accept an &#x27;apocryphon&#x27; because of the deep and difficult sayings in the Revelation . . . say that they are not John&#x27;s composition but Cernthus&#x27;, and have no right to a place in the church.&quot; Caius&#x27; view was refuted by his contemporary, Hippolytus of Rome, in a lost work entitled &quot;Capita Adversus Caium&quot; (Heads Against Caius), of which only fragments preserved in a commentary of Dionysius Bar-Salibi survive.

==Works attributed to Cerinthus==
Cerinthus may be the alleged recipient of the Apocryphon of James (codex I, text 2 of the Nag Hammadi library), although the name written is largely illegible. A late second century Christian sect (later dubbed the &quot;Alogi&quot;) headed by Caius of Rome alleged Cerinthus was the true author of the Gospel of John and Book of Revelation. According to Catholic Encyclopedia: Caius: &quot;Additional light has been thrown on the character of Caius&#x27;s dialogue against Proclus by Gwynne&#x27;s publication of some fragments from the work of Hippolytus &quot;Contra Caium&quot; (Hermathena, VI, p. 397 sq.); from these it seems clear that Caius maintained that the Apocalypse of John was a work of the Gnostic Cerinthus.&quot; The Book of Revelation (Apocalypse) is attributed to John by Christians before that time; third century theologian Tertullian indicates that all John&#x27;s foster churches (i.e., the churches of Asia Minor) when traced back to the beginning all rested on the Apostle John as its author, and that it receives the same recognition in all the other churches. Irenaeus makes consistent remarks.

== Cerinthus in literature ==
Cerinthus is featured in &quot;John&#x27;s Story: The Last Eyewitness&quot;, part of Christian writer Tim LaHaye&#x27;s &quot;The Jesus Chronicles&quot;. In the book Cerinthus, much to the disciple John&#x27;s frustration, has begun spreading his gnostic teachings to the populace, whereupon John is moved to write his counter-argument: the Gospel of John.

Cerinthus is mentioned in Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;A Death in the Desert&quot;, which recounts the death of John the Apostle. The poem concludes with the line &quot;&quot;But &#x27;twas Cerinthus that was lost&quot;.&quot;

<text>Beast (Dr. Henry Philip &quot;Hank&quot; McCoy) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics and is a founding member of the X-Men. Originally called &quot;The Beast&quot;, the character was introduced as a mutant possessing ape-like superhuman physical strength and agility, oversized hands and feet, a genius-level intellect, and otherwise normal appearance and speech. Eventually being referred to simply as &quot;Beast&quot;, Hank McCoy underwent progressive physiological transformations, gaining animalistic physical characteristics. These include blue fur, both simian and feline facial features, pointed ears, fangs, and claws. Beast&#x27;s physical strength and senses increased to even greater levels.

Despite Hank McCoy&#x27;s feral appearance, he is depicted as a brilliant, well-educated man in the arts and sciences, known for his witty sense of humor, and characteristically uses barbed witticisms with long words and intellectual references to distract his foes. He is a world authority on biochemistry and genetics, the X-Men&#x27;s medical doctor, and the science and mathematics instructor at the Xavier Institute (the X-Men&#x27;s headquarters and school for young mutants). He is also a mutant political activist, campaigning against society&#x27;s bigotry and discrimination against mutants. While fighting his own bestial instincts and fears of social rejection, Beast dedicates his physical and mental gifts to the creation of a better world for man and mutant.

One of the original X-Men, Beast has appeared regularly in X-Men-related comics since his debut. He has also been a member of the Avengers and Defenders. Various storylines over the years have hinted that Beast has capacity to become a supervillain; his alternative universe counterpart Dark Beast was a recurring character in 2000s and 2010s comics. During the Krakoan Age 2020s &quot;X-Men&quot; storylines, Beast assumes an antagonistic role to the other X-Men, becoming an outright villain. At the end of the Krakoan Age, the original Beast dies in an act of last minute redemption, and is replaced by his younger clone whose memories stop short of the events which corrupted the original Beast.

The character has also appeared in media adaptations, including animated TV series and feature films. Kelsey Grammer played the Beast in &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; (2006), while Nicholas Hoult portrayed a younger version of the character in &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011). Both Hoult and Grammer reprised their roles in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; (2014). Hoult reprised the role in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot; (2016), &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018) and &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot; (2019), while Grammer reprised the role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;The Marvels&quot; (2023).

==Publication history==
Created by writer Stan Lee and artist and co-writer Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 (September 1963). Stan Lee writes in the foreword to &quot;X-Men: The Ultimate Guide&quot; that he made Beast the most articulate, eloquent, and well-read of the X-Men to contrast with his brutish exterior. Further, the book opines that the Werner Roth–Roy Thomas team garnered admiration for their &quot;appealing and sensitive characterizations of the original X-Men&quot;. Roth, under the alias Jay Gavin, had taken over for Kirby fully by issue #18, and Thomas was a new talent. Beast was given an individualized, colorful new costume, along with the rest of the X-Men by issue #39 to attract new readers. During Jim Steranko&#x27;s tenure, which added &quot;exciting art&quot;, Roth returned, working with Neal Adams who blended Kirby&#x27;s style with &quot;realism, idealized beauty, and epic grandeur&quot;.

In &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; vol. 2 #11 (March 1972), written by Gerry Conway and drawn by Tom Sutton, Beast underwent a radical change and mutated into his now familiar furry, blue (originally grey) appearance. The concept originated with Roy Thomas, an effort to make the character more visibly striking, and Beast also became more werewolf-like to capitalize on the success of &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot;. Steve Englehart, who wrote the remainder of the Beast&#x27;s short-lived spotlight in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot;, emphasized the character&#x27;s wit rather than the tragedy of his transformation into a more monstrous form, reasoning that the Beast&#x27;s intelligence and sense of humor would allow him to see his misfortune in perspective. Over the next decade the Beast would appear on the roster of several teams in titles ranging from &quot;The Avengers&quot; to &quot;The Defenders&quot; to &quot;X-Factor&quot;. It was not until 1991, in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #70/&quot;X-Men&quot; #1, that the Beast finally returned to the X-Men.

Englehart later said that he added the Beast to the Avengers roster because he wanted to write the character again and thought his funny, down-to-earth personality would make him a good foil for Moondragon. Succeeding writers of &quot;The Avengers&quot; similarly found that the character&#x27;s lightheartedness made a good balance to the team&#x27;s generally serious tone, resulting in the Beast&#x27;s run in &quot;The Avengers&quot; outlasting his earlier run in &quot;X-Men&quot;. His friendship with fellow Avenger Wonder Man would likewise come to eclipse his friendship with X-Man Iceman for the comics fandom. &quot;The Avengers&quot; #137 (July 1975) debuted the Beast&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Oh, my stars and garters,&quot; and &quot;The Avengers&quot; #164 (October 1977) was the first to depict him as a sex symbol, a take which writer Jim Shooter said resulted in very positive mail from female readers in particular.

Beast cured the Legacy Virus in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #390 (2001), and in &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; #3 (2001) he experienced a further mutation into a feline being, first shown in the introduction to &quot;New X-Men&quot; (June, 2001), by Frank Quitely and Grant Morrison. As evidenced on the back cover of &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot; Chris Claremont, writer of that series in addition to both &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; (for sixteen consecutive years) and &quot;X-Factor&quot;, contributed much to the Beast&#x27;s characterization. Citing Claremont as inspiration for his run on &quot;New X-Men&quot;, Morrison explains Beast as a &quot;brilliant, witty bipolar scientist&quot;. Morrison continues, &quot;I saw Henry McCoy as an incredibly clever, witty, cultured, well-traveled, experienced, well-read character so I brought out those parts of his personality which seemed to me to fit the profiles of the smartest and most worldly people I know—his sense of humor is dark and oblique. He&#x27;s obviously quite clearly bipolar and swings between manic excitement and ghastly self-doubt. He has no dark secrets, however, and nothing to hide.&quot;

Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Astonishing X-Men: Gifted&quot; story arc featured a &quot;mutant cure&quot; designed by Indian Benetech scientist Dr. Kavita Rao, and the prospect of &quot;real&quot; humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal human experimentation on an unknown victim. The idea of a mutant cure, which had previously appeared in the 1992 animated series, was also the basis of the &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot; movie plot and the series was even made into a motion comic. IGN called the arc focusing on Beast &quot;best X-Men run in a decade&quot; and lauded Whedon for flawless character dynamics. According to &quot;BusinessWeek&quot;, Beast is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.

Beast appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010–2013 &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

In &quot;X-Men Legends&quot; Vol. 2 #1-2 (2022), taking place between &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; #181 - 182 and &quot;Giant Size X-Men&quot; #1 starring Wolverine, it is revealed that Beast was responsible for the existence of Wolverine&#x27;s will-be iconic X-Men mask, when Beast was manipulated by Mesmero into his amnesiac masked servant, Wildlife.

==Fictional character biography==
===Youth===
Henry Philip &quot;Hank&quot; McCoy was born in Dundee, Illinois, in the United States, to Norton and Edna McCoy. His father, Norton McCoy, is employed at a local nuclear power plant before Henry&#x27;s birth and was once exposed to intense nuclear radiation, which appears to have caused his son&#x27;s mutation. Hank is born with a vast intellect, unusually long arms and legs, and unusually large hands and feet—a rare although not unique case of mutant powers manifesting before puberty. His bodily proportions are comparable to those of a gorilla, and later stories reveal his nickname in school was &quot;Magilla Gorilla&quot;.

===With the X-Men===
Henry&#x27;s mutation more fully manifests during adolescence, providing greater strength and agility, and although his powers allow him to briefly excel in athletics during his remaining time at school, he soon attracts the animosity of his fellow students and other non-mutant humans. After defeating the villain Conquistador with the assistance of some X-Men, Hank joins the group and begins studying at Professor Charles Xavier&#x27;s Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters.

Henry recognizes the opportunities such an institution can offer him and accepts the invitation. He finds the school both a fountain of scientific knowledge and a place of sanctuary. There he is introduced to the X-Men, who accept him into their ranks and give him the codename Beast. Alongside workouts in the Danger Room, under Xavier&#x27;s tutelage, he studies subjects ranging from differential equations to Proust.

With the rest of the X-Men on their first field mission, he battles Magneto for the first time, and later Magneto&#x27;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. He became stressed because he had to keep a secret identity while in the X-Men team, so he briefly left the team to become a professional wrestler. While he was a professional wrestler he met Unus the Untouchable, and helped the X-Men build a directed-energy weapon to make Unus completely untouchable, resulting in Unus not being able to feed himself. Beast then rejoined the X-Men team. With the team, he also visits the Savage Land, and meets Ka-Zar. Beast battles the Juggernaut, but he is badly hurt. He subsequently fights the Sentinels with the X-Men, and he and Iceman battle the Maha Yogi.

===Furry change and team trading===
Hank is the first to leave the X-Men. He becomes a research scientist at the Brand Corporation, a genetics research facility. His assistant, Linda Donaldson, becomes his girlfriend. Hank isolates a &quot;hormonal extract&quot; allowing anyone to become a mutant for a short period of time, and uses the mutagenic serum on himself to disguise his appearance while foiling an attempt to steal his research. He waits too long to reverse the process, leaving him permanently transformed. He grows grey fur, which later turns blue, all over his body and acquires pointed ears, elongated canine teeth, claws, the ability to run on walls and ceilings like a spider, enhanced senses, an accelerated healing factor, and a feral side he struggles to control. He briefly joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants when Mastermind wipes out his memory, but quickly recovers. When Beast is wounded, he is aided by Patsy Walker, and then reunited with his old girlfriend, Vera Cantor. He fears that his furry form will repulse others, but finds that many women are attracted to his hirsuteness. Back at Brand Laboratories, he discovers his girlfriend Linda Donaldson is an agent of the criminal Secret Empire, and they break up.

Not long after this transformation, Beast is recruited to join the Avengers as a provisional member. He is later granted full Avengers membership and remains a member for many years, becoming a close friend of Wonder Man. He leaves the team periodically to rejoin the X-Men during times of need (such as &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot;). Beast returns to the Avengers each time, but eventually leaves so that the team, which has a six-member limit at the time, can be filled out by new recruits.

He later joins the Defenders, stays with the team to organize as the &quot;new&quot; Defenders, and is one of the final surviving members at the time of its first disbandment as a result of the battle with Moondragon and the Dragon of the Moon. Beast and fellow surviving Defenders members Angel and Iceman are contacted shortly after by Cyclops and Marvel Girl (Jean Grey) to form a new group, X-Factor.

===X-Factor===
With X-Factor, Beast rejoins the original members of the X-Men, and is again reunited with Vera Cantor. Beast starts out in his furred form, but on their second mission, he is captured by Tower. He is delivered to Carl Maddicks and used in an attempt to develop a cure for mutancy, which has rendered Maddicks&#x27; son, Artie, mute. Maddicks develops a serum based on McCoy&#x27;s original serum, and tests it on Beast. Hank is also subjected to chemotherapy and radiation, and has a cardiac arrest. X-Factor arrives on the scene and saves Hank, but not before he was injected with the serum. When the bandages around his face are removed, he is revealed to have lost his blue fur. This helps in X-Factor&#x27;s cover as normal humans who are mutant hunters for hire (though they actually help the mutants they capture). When they see the need for their powers, they get new costumes similar to their old X-Men costumes, and call themselves the X-Terminators, posing as renegade mutants. Beast wears a mask as he did originally, since he now looks human again.

Eventually X-Factor clashes with the ancient mutant Apocalypse after Angel loses his wings in a battle and shortly after goes missing. Apocalypse turns Angel into Death, the most powerful of his four Horsemen of Apocalypse. During the battle, Beast is touched by the Horseman Pestilence, whose touch usually causes incredible pain and viral infection. The infection interacts with the recent serum treatment of Maddicks, and instead of killing him, Hank is affected in such a way that every time he uses his superhuman strength, his intelligence decreases. Though the battle is won, it comes at the cost of Hank&#x27;s decreasing intelligence and Angel&#x27;s humanity, which would not return for a time. Hank&#x27;s condition worsens for weeks. He even openly talks to Trish Tilby, a reporter, not realizing she might use the information on TV. Out of respect for Hank&#x27;s situation, Trish does not mention his name when she reports about X-Factor&#x27;s recent battles, only that one of them lost his intellect while heroically defending New York. Beast is still hurt by her using the information at all, but she is able to convince him that she meant well.

X-Factor finally ends their charade and are hailed as heroes, and they then don costumes similar to their previous X-Terminator costumes. When Hank&#x27;s mind is nothing more than that of a child, he intercepts a mutant called Infectia who is trying to kiss Iceman. Infectia has the ability to manipulate molecular structures through touch, creating mutated &quot;monsters&quot;. When she kisses Beast, he becomes feverish and begins switching back and forth between his normal and furred forms. Finally, he stabilizes in his furry appearance, keeps his intelligence, and has more strength than ever.

===Return to X-Men===
Hank soon resumes wearing his old costume, but now no longer has need for a mask. During the events of &quot;Inferno&quot;, Beast, along with the rest of X-Factor team up with the X-Men and various other heroes to fight the evil forces invading the city; eventually, they manage to stop a portal between Limbo and Earth from remaining open and peace returns for the survivors. Soon after &quot;Inferno&quot; ends, the &quot;X-Tinction Agenda&quot; takes place where Genosha wants to punish various mutants for war crimes on their island. Here, Beast plays yet another key role. Shortly after the crisis ends, X-Factor switches costumes once more; Cyclops, Jean, and Iceman all wear identical costumes, while Beast returns to wearing trunks, and Archangel sticks to his old costume he received from Apocalypse.

Towards the end of this iteration of X-Factor, they battle the Shadow King during the &quot;Muir Island Saga&quot;. The final battle leaves Professor Xavier disabled again, which results in X-Factor rejoining the X-Men.

===Studying the Legacy Virus===
One of Beast&#x27;s greatest challenges emerges with Stryfe&#x27;s fatal Legacy Virus. Hank is already despondent, as he is turning thirty and questions his life accomplishments. His frustrations are further compounded when Professor Xavier and Moira MacTaggert did not ask for his assistance with the Legacy research, but it turns out Xavier is just giving him his privacy. Perusing their data, Hank learns the problem is more difficult than he had initially imagined. Hank has always believed that, given time, he could solve any problem; the Legacy Virus becomes his obsession. He goes as far as making an unethical decision in giving Mister Sinister information on the virus, since he has more resources and fewer morals to inhibit him.

A turning point comes when Dark Beast finishes some of the formula, occasionally prying more information from Hank whom he imprisoned and replaces for a while. The most critical step toward a solution (other than when Beast individually finds the cure without acknowledgement) comes when Dr. MacTaggert discovers Mystique&#x27;s irresponsible manipulation of virus strains. The cure is incomplete and it takes Beast to design the final cure. Based on Moira&#x27;s notes, Beast concocts the anti-virus to much elation, but when it is revealed that its use requires a mutant to die, Colossus chooses to sacrifice his life to release the remedy.

After mourning the loss of a teammate, Hank briefly leaves the school with Storm and her X-Treme X-Men team in search of Destiny&#x27;s diaries. After an attack by Vargas that leaves Psylocke dead, Beast is gravely injured and returns to the institute.

===Enhanced feline form===
As the world experiences a mutant baby boom, much of the mutant community seemingly begins experiencing &quot;secondary mutations&quot;, often taking the form of additional or enhanced abilities. In the aftermath of Vargas&#x27; attack, Beast&#x27;s secondary mutation is &quot;jumpstarted&quot; due to the powers of teammate Sage. The further mutation causes Beast to develop a more feline physique, to which he initially has some trouble adapting. A psychic attack by the genocidal Cassandra Nova leaves Beast humiliated, badly beaten (by the controlled body of his friend Beak) and haunted by the possibility that his new form is simply a step in a continuous state of devolution. Additionally, the alteration in form causes his long-time girlfriend, Trish Tilby, to break up with him after being accused of bestiality in the media. Over time, Beast strikes up a strong friendship with Emma Frost, in one incident bringing her flowers to cheer her up. He finds her diamond form shattered into thousands of pieces and spends some time putting her back together. With a final jolt of psionic energy from Jean Grey, Frost returns to life.

Beast later uncovers what seems to be a female mutant with feline features, like his situation. This raises hopes for him, until he discovers it is not a mutant human that looks like a cat, it is a mutant cat who looks like a human. Either way, the creature is at the limit of her life and Beast allows her to leave the X-Mansion to die quietly in a spot she finds comfortable.

===Astonishing X-Men===
When news of a &quot;cure&quot; that would reverse mutations suddenly arises, Beast finds himself seriously considering taking it so he can once again appear human. Hank eventually decides against it after vigorous &quot;urging&quot; by fellow team member Wolverine, as it would send out a negative message to other mutants if an X-Man were to take the cure. After learning that the cure was developed by fellow geneticist Kavita Rao through experimentation on mutant corpses—as well as on the revived X-Man Colossus—Beast helps take down Rao&#x27;s operation. When the villainous Hellfire Club attacks the X-Men, Cassandra Nova telepathically strips away Beast&#x27;s higher human consciousness, leaving him with only his animal instincts. After he hunts Wolverine around campus (and even eats his leg), a student named Blindfold faces him down with a device he and Xavier had built in case his consciousness was ever lost. The device is a high-powered sensory stimulant in the form of a ball of string, which Beast had alluded to as being his greatest fear. Once restored, he is quick to put on a suit and tie and help Wolverine with a hyper-magnetic device. He, along with his teammates, are taken from the Mansion by the government agency S.W.O.R.D. and airlifted to the alien Breakworld.

===Civil War===
When a Civil War breaks out among Marvel&#x27;s superheroes, Beast, along with the other X-Men, assumes a neutral stance. Beast was not a particular fan of the policy and secretly violates his stance by providing Spider-Man with a holographic disguise to enable him to continue teaching at Midtown High after his secret identity has been exposed. Despite his personal feelings about the Superhuman Registration Act, Beast enlists his services to the Initiative program after the war&#x27;s end, to assist in the training of the next generation of superheroes.

===Endangered Species===
The X-Men and various other mutants attend the funeral of a young mutant boy named Matt Landru who has been killed in a road traffic accident and muse on what this means for mutant-kind. Beast plans to find a way to reverse M-Day. Despite the &#x27;aid&#x27; of his other self (the Dark Beast), along with exploring such diverse avenues of investigation as analysis of alternate timelines or an attempt to track down the Scarlet Witch, he is unsuccessful in his research, but the final part shows him holding a child wearing a three-eyed smiley face shirt saying &quot;Evolution&quot; on it as a promotion of the &quot;Messiah Complex&quot;.

===Messiah CompleX===
Beast is shown helping Professor X repair Cerebro when the X-Men are tracking down the child with the X-Gene. Beast is later seen at the Mansion when it is attacked by the Sentinels, who have been taken over by an unknown person. When Iceman arrives at the school with the New X-Men, Beast works with Prodigy and is able to stabilize the mortally wounded Hellion, as well as the other New X-Men and X-Men injured in their battles with the Purifiers and the Marauders, respectively. He is later present during the battle on Muir Island and is among the first to reach Professor Xavier after he is accidentally shot by Bishop. Xavier&#x27;s body soon disappears.

In the aftermath, Cyclops has sent Beast to search for Professor Xavier, whose status is unknown by the X-Men. Beast is also seen closing down the ruins of the X-Mansion and taking Martha Johansson with him.

===Move to San Francisco===
Beast is seen as part of the team setting up a new X-Men headquarters in San Francisco, California. He is working closely with Cyclops, Emma Frost, and the rookie X-Man, Armor. He is also still seeing Abigail Brand, who requests that he take a weekend off from the X-Men so that she can &#x27;tamper with him extensively&#x27;. He helps Tabitha Smith, teaching the young and flippant woman to use research instead of brutal strength to fight her enemy, a mutant with sedation powers called Nuwa. He and Warren go to Buenos Aires to recruit Doctor Nemesis to help the X-Men save the Mutant race. Only after they stop tube-grown super Nazis, does Nemesis agree. They also recruit Madison Jeffries. Together, they created a time travel device so that they could travel into the future and retrieve the mutant Messiah. However, because they created a device for time travel in so little time, the side-effect of the device is that the user&#x27;s biology breaks down upon entering the future, so it will automatically bring the person back in thirty-two and a half hours.

Beast discovers that the Super-Skrulls with X-Men abilities can be infected with the Legacy Virus. Despite his ethical protests to the contrary, Cyclops decides to use it on them, offering the antidote in return for the Skrulls&#x27; retreat.

===The X-Club===
To save mutantkind from the effects of M-Day, Beast and Angel had to gather a team of specialists to help them. They gathered Madison Jeffries, Yuriko Takiguchi, and Doctor Nemesis. They then returned to Graymalkin Industries to meet their final member Dr. Kavita Rao (who was formerly trying to cure mutation). Beast and the X-Club traveled back to 1906 to find Doctor Nemesis&#x27;s parents and discover the origins of modern mutation. During the mission, they also fought an early version of a Sentinel created by the Hellfire Club, and inadvertently caused the San Francisco earthquake. When they returned to the present, they found that their DNA evidence had been buried beneath where the Dreaming Celestial was standing in the park.

===Utopia===
After being captured, Beast became a test subject for the Omega Machine (designed by Dark Beast to eradicate mutant powers and place them in Weapon Omega) while being held prisoner on Alcatraz Island by Norman Osborn, along with Professor X. Beast is shown getting weaker and mentions losing his claws while hooked up to the machine. Beast was rescued by the X-Men, and later recuperated from his injuries. Later, he spoke at the funeral of Yuriko Takiguchi when Magneto had arrived. Beast seemed increasingly disillusioned with Cyclops&#x27; leadership and methods, such as allowing Magneto to become a member to his time under torture under the Dark Beast. This resulted in Beast leaving the X-Men.

===S.W.O.R.D.===
After leaving the X-Men, Beast opted to join his current girlfriend Agent Abigail Brand as a member of S.W.O.R.D. However, shortly after joining her in space, Brand&#x27;s co-commander, Henry Peter Gyrich (hired by Norman Osborn) begins to round-up the aliens residing on Earth, in a xenophobic attempt at avoiding another Secret Invasion. As a result of Henry&#x27;s plan, he has even made moves against Brand, resulting in her, Beast, and the dragon Lockheed, becoming fugitives from S.W.O.R.D. and attempting to overthrow Gyrich.

===Second Coming===
Beast later returns in an issue of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; to attend the funeral of his friend and teammate, Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) where he confronts Scott Summers and blames Kurt&#x27;s death on Scott&#x27;s increasingly militant and extremist attitude to protecting the mutant species at all costs (even at the cost of sacrificing his friends to do so). Despite his issues with Cyclops, Beast remains on Utopia to help deal with the attacks being made by Bastion. Following Bastion&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Hope Summers, Henry again departs Utopia.

===Secret Avengers===
Hank appears as part of Steve Rogers&#x27; Secret Avengers team. He goes with the covert ops squad on their mission to Mars, and assisted the team in helping Shang-Chi. He also played a crucial part in the capture, interrogation, and &quot;un-brainwashing&quot; of John Steele.

===Schism and AvX===
After the separation of the X-Men into two teams, Beast is in the team that goes with Wolverine to open The Jean Grey School for Higher Learning in Westchester County, New York.

During the &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; mini-series, Beast sides with the Avengers to investigate and stop the Phoenix Force&#x27;s return to Earth. Hank joins the team of Avengers sent to halt the Phoenix Force&#x27;s return to Earth, but later temporarily resigns from the Avengers in protest against their efforts to stop the &#x27;Phoenix Five&#x27;—the five X-Men who have received the power of the Phoenix Force—as their actions appear to initially be benevolent. He returns to aid the Avengers and the X-Men when Cyclops and Emma Frost begin to be corrupted by the Phoenix&#x27;s power.

===Accelerated mutation and time travel===
In the aftermath of the Phoenix War, Cyclops now actively strikes out at government organizations and holds mutants prisoner, with the X-Men unwilling to actively fight him as they fear the subsequent mutant civil war that might result. Beast, who is apparently dying due to side-effects of his secondary artificially-accelerated mutation, stumbles upon a solution after a chance comment from Iceman to the effect that the Cyclops they knew when they were young would not tolerate his present self&#x27;s actions. Beast travels back in time to the early days of the Xavier Institute to bring the original five X-Men from that period into the future, hoping that Scott&#x27;s past self will be able to convince his present self to stand down.

Beast lapses into a coma shortly after bringing the team into the present, and Jean&#x27;s telepathy, which is artificially accelerated by the trauma of her trip to the future and witnessing what Scott has become, manages to connect the minds of the two Hanks. This allows the younger Hank to spot a mistake in his future self&#x27;s calculations and stabilize his physiology by reverting to a blue-furred ape-like state again where this form is bald and has no head hair aside from the blue fur covering his whole body. The young X-Men decide to stay in the present and become the All-New X-Men, except for Angel, who joins Cyclops&#x27; Uncanny X-Men.

===Death of X and working with Inhumans===
After Cyclops goes to Muir Island and discovers that all of the mutants died painful deaths, he calls Beast to do a diagnosis and Beast discovers that somehow that the Terrigen cloud, the substance that gives Inhumans their powers, has become toxic towards mutants after mixing with the atmosphere changed its structure. Hoping to bridge Inhuman and Mutant relations in light of this new conflict, Beast works with the Inhumans to find a way to make the Terrigen cloud safe for mutants while making sure it remains suitable for Inhuman powers. He becomes a trusted ally to the Inhumans and joins their counsel.

===Inhumans vs X-Men===
When the present Beast realizes that he cannot find a cure for the Terrigen cloud, he visits the rest of the mutants and advises them that the best course of action is for all mutants to leave Earth, but his teammates object and imprison him before he can warn the Inhumans that war is coming. However, after learning what the cloud will do to mutants, Medusa activates a generator to destroy the Terrigen cloud, leaving Emma to be branded a traitor for her false claims inform about Cyclops&#x27;s true death to manipulate the X-Men into destroying the Inhumans. Havok helps Emma to escape for the sake of his brother&#x27;s memory, while Beast and his remaining teammates make up, all regretting what their lives have come to ever since discovering that the Terrigen could kill them.

===Residing on Krakoa===

During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, Magik brings Opal of Hordeculture to Krakoa and gives her to Beast so that they can work on a potion containing the toxic material from the black walnut tree. Beast and Opal succeed in making the formula. Using Hordeculture&#x27;s technology, Beast revives Explodey Boy so that he can confront his zombie counterpart.

==Powers and abilities==
It is possible that Beast&#x27;s mutation is a result of genetic atavism. However, he also possesses neotenous characteristics, which may explain him having a genius-level intellect despite his animal physique. He also possesses superhuman strength, speed and agility. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, employing a unique style of acrobatic combat, from combat training he received at Professor Xavier&#x27;s and coaching from Captain America.

===Anthropoid/Simian physique===
Originally, Hank McCoy retains the basic features of a normal human alongside a generally simian physiology (e.g., elongated limbs and enlarged extremities) equivalent to that of a great ape. This mutation gives him superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance. Hank is equally dexterous with all four limbs; able to perform tasks with his feet or hands with equal ease. Because of his talents and training, Beast can outperform any Olympic-level athlete, contorting his body and performing aerial feats gracefully. His strength and dexterity allow him to climb vertical surfaces with just his hands or feet, jump great distances and survive falls that would kill any ordinary person. He also possesses enhanced senses and can track people for great distances over open terrain and his feet are sensitive enough to detect electronic signals (from bombs, listening devices, etc.) through solid walls and floors. Later, he drank an experimental solution of his own making and mutated further through the growth of grey fur covering his entire body and the enhancement of all of his existing abilities, especially his strength, and Hank also gained a nearly instantaneous healing factor. The psychological impact of this first transformation caused Beast to experience short-term amnesia and also made it difficult for him to control his animalistic instincts, which would cause him to slip into an uncontrollable berserker rage during combat. However, his body suddenly mutated again after a short time, changing his fur color from grey to black (although comic book printing technology depicted it as blue), returning his strength to previous levels, and losing his healing factor. He was also able to more easily control his animal instincts after this second mutation. Beast gained the ability to emit mood-altering pheromones, causing sexual attraction in women. Hank McCoy briefly returned to his human form with his hair color now being depicted as black, not reddish brown. During this time he was occasionally depicted with claws and fangs, but these were not a part of his original mutation. However, as a result of being touched by Pestilence his strength began to increase exponentially while his intellect began to decrease.

After Infectia&#x27;s kiss restored Hank to his simian physique, his intellect had stabilized and returned to his previous genius-level, and his strength had increased to superhuman proportions. Beast&#x27;s fangs and claws became a consistent part of his appearance after this return to his &quot;blue and furry&quot; form.

Beast would later be stabilized to a more human/ape-like form with pointy ears, fangs, and no hair except for the fur on his head.

===Feline physique===
After being critically wounded, Hank&#x27;s body undergoes a secondary mutation, jump-started by Sage. The result is a more feline appearance equivalent to that of a big cat with a cat-like head and feet. His strength, speed, stamina, sturdiness, and senses increase further with this change. He gains catlike agility, flexibility, coordination, and balance, and all his senses are enhanced to twenty times that of a normal human being. In addition, Beast develops an accelerated healing factor that allows him to repair mild to moderate injuries within the span of a few hours. However, as his hands and feet change from simian to feline (going from a normal human set of four fingers to just three, retaining the opposable thumb), he loses his superhuman dexterity, once admitting that he used to play the guitar, but is now learning to play the drums instead. Following the X-Men&#x27;s relocation to San Francisco, Beast discovers that he had regained some of his old manual dexterity. In the first issue of Warren Ellis&#x27; &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; run, Beast also comments he no longer needs full sleep.

It is later discovered that his secondary feline mutation is still detrimental to his health: as such, with the combined efforts of past versions of Jean Grey and himself, Beast&#x27;s condition was stabilized in a more human/ape-like form, possessing blue fur and larger than the average human male but otherwise fairly human.

===Genius-level intellect===
Hank possesses a brilliant intellect. He is a world-renowned biochemist, having earned PhDs in Biophysics and Genetics, and is the man who cured the Legacy Virus. He frequently functions as both field medic and in-house physician for the X-Men, despite not technically having a medical degree. His intelligence and expertise in genetics rival that of Professor X, Moira MacTaggert, and Kavita Rao. Despite this, he has never received a Nobel Prize or been elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. A Renaissance man, McCoy is well versed in many fields including linguistics (fluent in English, German, French, Latin, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, and Russian as well as the fictional language Latverian), literature, philosophy, psychology, sociology, history, art and art history, anthropology, music, political science and economics with a special affinity for science and technology and a penchant for quoting literary classics including Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. His vast scientific knowledge ranges from theoretical physics, quantum mechanics, differential equations, nanotechnology, anatomy, biomedicine, analytical chemistry, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering to the construction of a hyper-magnetic device. An electronics expert, he often repairs Cerebro and makes upgrades to the Danger Room settings. He has made several deus ex machina devices on par with Reed Richards, including a device that strips entities of cosmic powers. While not a medical doctor, he was able to perform brain surgery on the Red Skull to extract the fragment of Charles Xavier&#x27;s brain that the Skull had grafted onto himself, removing the Skull&#x27;s telepathic abilities while leaving the villain otherwise apparently healthy.

===Time-displaced Beast&#x27;s abilities===
After a meeting with Doctor Strange, the displaced younger Beast has mastered a combination of science and magic, allowing him to return himself and his four teammates to the past for a few minutes, although he notes that it took a great deal of effort to send them back for that long and it merely confirmed that history has been &#x27;reset&#x27; so that the displaced X-Men are no longer &#x27;needed&#x27; in the past. He has also mastered a mystical portal that allowed him to send the Juggernaut to Siberia after passing through Hell.

==Similarities==
According to writer Will Murray, a possible inspiration for the Beast was Andrew Blodgett &quot;Monk&quot; Mayfair, a companion of pulp hero Doc Savage. Both are possessed of an apelike appearance and are brilliant scientists. Before becoming more erudite in later issues, McCoy also used a great deal of slang in his early appearances much like Monk.

==Other versions==
===Time-displaced Beast===
====All-New X-Men====
The younger Hank and All-New X-Men defect to Cyclops&#x27;s school, after the events of the Battle of the Atom unfold. Young Hank is later transported to the Ultimate Marvel universe, where he is captured by that world&#x27;s version of Doctor Doom, then teams up with the Guardians of the Galaxy in finding the Black Vortex.

The time-displaced Jean Grey accidentally reads the mind of the present Beast and finds out that he regrets never telling her his true feeling. Jean then confronts the time-displaced Hank and gives him a kiss. They do not have time to develop their relationship since Dr. Octopus attacks them in New York City,

====Introduction to magic====
Following the reconstruction of reality after the Battleworld crisis, the displaced X-Men remain in the future, travelling the world as they try to find their place, while the &#x27;present&#x27; Beast works with the Inhumans to find a means of resolving the recent release of Terrigenesis crystals that have proven dangerous to mutants. Increasingly frustrated with his inability to find a way back to their time through science, the young Beast contacts Doctor Strange for advice on using magic, but although Strange cannot help due to his currently weakened powers, when Hank is able to help him find a solution to a dimensional rift he was investigating, Strange reassures Hank that he is smart enough to find a solution to the current dilemma. After the conflict with the Inhumans is concluded, the younger Beast reveals to his teammates that he has determined, through a combination of science and magic, that the younger X-Men cannot return to the past as they are already there, leaving them free to travel the world and find their own place.

====RessurXion====
The young Beast finds himself working alongside Magneto along with the rest of the time-displaced X-Men doing whatever it takes to preserve Xavier&#x27;s dream. Beast begins to use magic more freely on their missions, something that greatly distresses Cyclops. Whenever they are at X-Men HQ Beast spends most of his time on his own to continue study magic and becomes increasingly reclusive in the process.

===1602===
In &quot;Marvel 1602&quot;, Beast is known as Hal McCoy and retains his original appearance of a human with lengthy arms and legs and enormous hands and feet. He is well spoken and eloquent, and a member of Carlos Javier&#x27;s (Professor X) group of &quot;witchbreeds&quot;, though he tends to not give others a chance to speak when he is talking. When several soldiers stare at him, he glowers and attributes his appearance to his origin as an Orkneyman. He also tells of his mother&#x27;s humiliation when he was born, her cruel neighbours having suggested that Hal&#x27;s father was an ape.

He reappears in &quot;Spider-Man 1602&quot;. Between the two appearances he was working with Henri Le Pym, a natural philosopher employed by Baron Octavius to create a potion that will counteract the effects an octopus based serum have had on his physiology. Testing some of the potions on himself, Hal becomes more bestial in appearance. When he first appears in &quot;Spider-Man 1602&quot; #1, he is imprisoned in Le Pym&#x27;s laboratory, treated as a source of mutagenic blood rather than a fellow scientist.

He is not shown clearly until he is released from the cage by Peter Parquagh in #3. He resembles a gorilla to a greater extent than the main universe Beast, with only a slight blue tinge to his fur.

===Age of Apocalypse/Dark Beast===

The Dark Beast, sometimes known as the Black Beast, is a Marvel Comics supervillain, an evil alternative from the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;.

===Deadpool Corps===
In the second issue of &quot;Prelude to Deadpool Corps&quot;. Deadpool visits a world where Prof. X runs a school for troubled kids. There Beast is a teacher and sends child versions of Cyclops and Deadpool to see Storm for causing trouble in class.

===Exiles===
A version of Beast from Earth-763 is drafted onto the superhero team the Exiles. Beast-763 is far more brutish in appearance, including a long tail and strongly protruding canine teeth. He was seemingly killed while fighting MODOK, but was in fact taken to join the Exiles. It was revealed that this version of Beast lost most of his intelligence due to his mutation, however he regained his mind after he was briefly connected to the Crystal Palace. Also this version of Beast was in a romantic relationship with Wonder-Man. At the end if the series, Beast was given the option to return to his home, but seeing that Wonder-Man was killed in battle shortly after, decided he had nothing to go back to and remained with the team.

===Versions seen in Endangered Species===
During the &quot;X-Men: Endangered Species&quot; storyline after &quot;House of M&quot;, Beast tried to ask Doctor Strange for help fixing the problem. Dr. Strange not only demonstrated that he could not help, but showed Beast a number of alternative reality versions of him who were facing equal failure, including but not limited to: a version of Beast in the raiment of a Catholic hierarch, a red-furred gun-toting version seeking a cure with Bishop, a version with a cyborg arm, a wheelchair-using version using a synthesis of magic and technology, a version who looked like Beast&#x27;s original human form, and a caped Beast in a snowy landscape.

===Here Comes Tomorrow===
In the &quot;Here Comes Tomorrow&quot; story arc (set 150 years in the X-Men&#x27;s future), Beast takes on the role of Headmaster of the Xavier Institute after the death of Jean Grey and the retirement of Charles Xavier and Scott Summers. Unable to cope with the pressures of this position and trying to find a cure for the looming extinction of the human race, Beast turns to the power-enhancing drug Kick. Unbeknownst to him, Kick is an aerosol form of an entity known as Sublime. Sublime takes over Beast&#x27;s body, relegating him to a passenger in his own form. 150 years after the death of Jean Grey, Sublime is finally purged from the aged, white-furred Beast, who is seconds later beheaded by Sublime&#x27;s champion Appolyon.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; reality, Beast appears as a scientist working alongside Hank Pym and Forge, all of whom work for Tony Stark. Here, he retains his human appearance similar to when he first joined X-Men and Beast assumes he is superior to humans, simply because of his mutations.

===Marvel Noir===
In &quot;X-Men Noir&quot;, Hank McCoy is a member of the X-Men, a band of young, sociopathic criminals. Like his mainstream counterpart, McCoy is physically imposing as well as an avid student, though he has a penchant for employing obscure words in an inaccurate way.

===Marvel Zombies===
It appears that Beast, along with the other not-yet infected X-Men, battling the zombified Alpha Flight, in &quot;Marvel Zombies: Dead Days&quot;. However he has been unexpectedly infected by a squad of zombies, and he next returns as a zombie.

He also appears in &quot;Marvel Zombies vs. The Army Of Darkness&quot;, Beast works with Reed Richards to rewire Cerebro to detect humans. Many are detected at Doctor Doom&#x27;s castle and Beast participates in the multi-zombie attack upon it and somehow both found a sizeable stash of meat, which ironically pleases the other zombies.

Beast is later shown arguing with Colonel America when the Colonel is vigorously explaining to him how things work after he led the massive attack that killed the Silver Surfer. However, he ends up slain by the Colonel&#x27;s newly granted &#x27;cosmic powers&#x27; when he accidentally blasts off his head.

===X-Men: Misfits===
In &quot;X-Men: Misfits&quot;, Beast is portrayed as always in a blue bear humanoid like form with a short tail, he wears glasses and a tie with the X-Men symbol on it. He is a professor at the school, and is strangely never referred to as Hank or Beast by name in the story.

===Mutant X===
In the &quot;Mutant X&quot; universe, Hank McCoy is a member of the Six, a team of mutant heroes led by Havok. Instead of a furry simian-like form, McCoy&#x27;s experiments mutated him into a green, amphibious form with childlike intelligence, codenamed the Brute. As well as having his usual acrobatic and athletic ability, Hank has webbed extremities and can breathe underwater. He becomes further mutated during the &quot;Inferno&quot; crisis, when he makes a deal with the demons S&#x27;ym and N&#x27;astirh. This mutation gives him hooves instead of feet.

When the Goblyn Queen first ascends to power, she brainwashes the Brute into serving her purpose. Scotty Summers, the child of Havok and the Goblyn Queen, unknowingly frees the Brute from her control. After the Goblyn Queen is defeated, the Brute chooses to remain with the Six.

Later, Brute jumps in front of a psychic blast from Professor X that was meant for Havok. This has the unexpected effect of restoring his intellect, and the Brute tries to find a way to return Havok to his reality, to cure Bloodstorm and Gambit of their vampirism, and to restore Ice-Man. Brute succeeds in all, but Havok opts not to return to the main Marvel Universe. The Brute&#x27;s intelligence is lost again as the after-effects of Xavier&#x27;s blast wear off.

Brutes stays with the team until the series ends. He is seriously injured by Dracula during the finale issue, thus his ultimate fate is left uncertain.

===New Exiles===
After the New Exiles land on the world of warring empires, they encounter Dame Emma Frost, head of Britain&#x27;s Department X and founder of Force-X. This team include Hank McCoy, a more feline version of Beast who is codenamed Puma.

===Shadow-X===
New Excalibur battles an evil counterpart of the Beast who is a member of the Shadow-X, the X-Men of an alternative reality in which Professor X was possessed by the Shadow King. They are brought to Earth-616 as a result of M-Day. This version of Beast, never having been free to fiddle around with his mutation, retained the more human appearance he had in the Original X-Men. He was later killed by Sage.

===Star Trek crossover===
One notable crossover in which Beast appeared was the &quot;Star Trek/X-Men&quot; crossover, in which the X-Men traveled to the 23rd Century to team up with the original crew of the &quot;U.S.S. &quot;Enterprise&quot;&quot;. During the encounter, Beast met his &quot;Star Trek&quot; counterpart, Dr. Leonard McCoy. (When a nurse calls out, &quot;Dr. McCoy!&quot; both Beast and Dr. Leonard McCoy answer, &quot;What?&quot;) The story also featured Beast teaming up with Mr. Spock to stop an inter-dimensional rift caused by the villain Proteus. In a one-page drawing included at the end of the issue in the artist pin-up gallery, we see Beast and Mr. Spock engaged in a game of 3D chess, with Beast intently studying the chessboard while perched on the headrest of a chair.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;, Ultimate Henry &quot;Hank&quot; McCoy was born with hands instead of feet, he tried to make a substance that would cure his mutation but instead it only made it worse. With his own parents denouncing him throughout his childhood for his genetic status, he chooses to hide his immense intelligence to avoid further complications. Hank becomes a founding member of the Ultimate X-Men taking the codename Beast. He also takes on the role of the team&#x27;s elite engineer, frequently upgrading the X-Men&#x27;s Blackbird X-Jet and Danger Room sequences.

When the team is kidnapped by Weapon X, they operate on him, causing him to take on his blue furry appearance and gain additional, strengthened senses, such as smell and hearing.

Beast begins an on again/off again relationship with Storm. Storm loves him because of his intelligence, but Beast&#x27;s inferiority complex often gets in the way of their relationship. He becomes convinced that Storm only loves him because Professor X is using mind control on her. Beast starts an online relationship that eventually leads to the Ultimate War debacle, when he lets it slip that Magneto is still alive (the supposed mutant &quot;supermodel&quot; Naomi he is chatting with is actually the Blob fishing for information).

Beast is killed after being crushed under the rubble of a Sentinel attack. While his death is felt by all of the X-Men, it has had the greatest impact upon Storm. However, it is revealed that the Beast is revived at the hospital. Xavier and Nick Fury keep his survival a secret, Xavier making Beast believe he is regularly visiting his family and the X-Men to keep him occupied. Having reversed himself back to his normal human appearance (maintaining the blue hair from his former kangaroo kidney transplant, which was independent of Weapon X&#x27;s modifications), Hank is now working on a cure to a &quot;Legacy Virus&quot;, created by an anti-mutant government conspiracy led by Admiral Stryker, that threatens mutants. The apparent death of Xavier (actually time travel) breaks the mental holds on him so he knows that everyone thinks he is dead and is not happy being forced to work for S.H.I.E.L.D. Beast escapes S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and heads towards Xavier&#x27;s Institute. He later rescues Pyro, and shocks his former teammates by revealing that he is still alive. After being proved to be the real Beast by Psylocke and Wolverine, he is allowed to join Bishop&#x27;s new X-Men and continues his relationship with Storm. After Bishop&#x27;s death, Xavier is revealed to be alive and Beast returns to his life at the Xavier Institute.

In Issue #1 of &quot;Ultimatum&quot;, Beast, among Dazzler, Angel and Nightcrawler are overwhelmed in Magneto&#x27;s flooding of New York (via Thor&#x27;s hammer). Angel survives the flood and recovers the bodies of Dazzler and Beast, who drowned. As Scott mourns over his dead friend&#x27;s corpse, he sorrowfully comments that he honestly cannot believe that &quot;that size 16-wearing dweeb&quot; would borrow his best tie and then die with it on.

Hank has a genius level IQ. His mutation grants him a simian physiology with superhuman strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, agility, flexibility, coordination, balance, and manual and pedal dexterity so great he can write with all his hands and feet at once and tie knots equally well with both his fingers and toes. The Weapon X program mutates Hank further, causing him to evolve into a more animalistic form with claws, fangs, pointed ears, enhanced senses, and thick, blue fur covering his entire body. Since then, he is like this continuously throughout the comics until his own modifications are made.

===What If?===
An issue of &quot;What If?&quot; asked &quot;What If Beast Had Truly Become a Beast.&quot; As Hank McCoy has isolated a catalyst for a mutation in a hormone extract, industrial spies attacked and he drank the extract. He then turned into a beast when the catalyst was too well concentrated. As he escaped into the night looking for meat, Professor X telepathically contacted Beast to ask if he was OK. Beast savagely responded that he was no longer an X-Man and refused to accept his help. Professor X sent the X-Men to retrieve him before any harm can come to people. Beast managed to take Angel down before being scared away by Jean&#x27;s telepathic scream. When Jean Grey and Cyclops caught up with him, Beast attacked, throwing rocks at them. With his optic beam, Cyclops destroyed most of the stones but one is able to knock out Jean Grey. When Beast was about to claim Jean as a meal, Professor X used his telepathy to calm Beast down. In his final human words, Beast told Professor X not to let him become an animal. To keep humans safe from him, the X-Men released Beast into the Savage Land where he became Ka-Zar and Zabu&#x27;s hunting companion.

Beast appears in the &quot;What If?&quot; story &quot;What If the X-Men Died on their First Mission?&quot; as the leader of a newly formed X-Men team following his former teammates&#x27; demise on Krakoa, consisting of Theresa Cassidy (who named herself Banshee in honor of her late father), Rahne Sinclair, Namorita, and James Proudstar, the brother of the original Thunderbird.

===X-Men Fairy Tales===
Beast appears as the monkey, (Japanese for &quot;blue&quot;). Aoi appears younger and more monkey-like than the 616 version of Beast, although he retains his blue fur. Unlike the studious and intellectual Beast, Aoi is playful and mischievous. After being outwitted, Aoi joins Hitome (Cyclops). He also shows an ability to change into a larger stronger form.

===X-Men: Forever===
In this alternative reality of &quot;X-Men: Forever&quot; (with a history identical to 616) that begins after Chris Claremont&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; 1–3, Beast retains his blue-furred ape-like appearance, and is the X-Men&#x27;s chief-scientist. Beast is responsible for checking for blood-work of two Storms (one who is an evil adult and the other who is a teenager) and discovers that they are identical. After the death of Logan, who Jean was having an affair with behind Cyclops&#x27; back, Beast becomes Jean&#x27;s closest friend and confidant, trying to help her over-come her loss, and her newly re-awakened Phoenix power. Recently, Jean has admitted to knowing about Hank&#x27;s long-time crush on her, and the two begin a relationship.

===Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe===
In the limited series Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe, Wolverine encounters Deadpool who has killed Beast and turned his pelt into a cloak.

===Old Man Logan===
In the &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; storyline, Beast is among the X-Men who perish at the hands of Wolverine when he is tricked by Mysterio into believing his friends are super-villains attacking the mansion.

===Battle of the Atom===
In the possible future witnessed in &quot;Battle of the Atom&quot;, Beast has mutated further, with one side of his head notably more feral than the other, including a horn. He has also defected to the Brotherhood, having apparently become disillusioned with the X-Men&#x27;s goal while blaming himself for causing some unspecified catastrophe by bringing his past self into the present. He is apparently killed in the final confrontation between the various time-displaced X-Men teams, with the past and present Hank vowing that they will never accept that they become what they have just witnessed. However, he later appears alive during the future Brotherhood&#x27;s new attack on Cyclops&#x27; base, during which the X-Men discover that the entire Brotherhood (With the exception of Raze, the son of Wolverine and Mystique) were under the control of Charles Xavier II (The apparent son of Xavier and Mystique), with Hank&#x27;s future self being allowed just enough freedom to be horrified at what Xavier II was making him do as the telepath blames the X-Men for failing to live up to Charles Xavier&#x27;s dream. At the conclusion of the fight, Hank and others are freed from Xavier II&#x27;s control and allowed to return to their home time, with Hank still blaming himself for some past mistake but committed to making up for it by returning to the X-Men.

* Beast appears in &quot;X-Men: The Last Stand&quot;, portrayed by Kelsey Grammer. This version is an associate of the X-Men, alumnus of Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters, and member of the U.S. Cabinet who serves as Secretary of Mutant Affairs. After learning of a &quot;mutant cure&quot; being developed and the Brotherhood of Mutants responding violently against it, Beast resigns from his position to help the X-Men defend the cure&#x27;s production facility on Alcatraz Island, with the former using the cure on the Brotherhood&#x27;s leader, Magneto. Following the battle, Beast is appointed United States Ambassador to the United Nations.
* A young Hank McCoy appears in &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, portrayed by Nicholas Hoult. Actor Benjamin Walker was originally cast in the role, but dropped out of the film to star in the Broadway musical &quot;Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson&quot;. This version initially works for the CIA&#x27;s Division X and originally possesses prehensile feet and enhanced speed, agility, and reflexes. After being recruited into Charles Xavier&#x27;s fledgling X-Men and falling in love with teammate Mystique, McCoy develops a serum derived from her DNA in an attempt to cure himself, only to turn himself into a blue-furred, feline form. After receiving the name &quot;Beast&quot; from teammate Havok, McCoy serves as the X-Men&#x27;s pilot during their mission to foil the Hellfire Club&#x27;s plot to start World War III.
* Two incarnations of Hank McCoy appear in &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, portrayed again by Nicholas Hoult and Kelsey Grammer. Hoult&#x27;s incarnation temporarily uses a serum to suppress his mutation until he and Xavier are recruited by the latter&#x27;s future self and Wolverine to help avert a Sentinel-controlled future while Grammer&#x27;s incarnation makes a cameo appearance in the new timeline. Additionally, a viral marketing website for the film reveals Beast was killed in 2015 by an angry mob of human protesters outside his home in upstate New York before Wolverine changed the timeline.
* Hank McCoy appears in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;, portrayed again by Nicholas Hoult. As of this film, he has returned to using his suppression serum while developing a new jet in the X-Mansion&#x27;s basement before he re-reverts to his Beast form to help the X-Men fight Apocalypse and his Horsemen.
* Hank McCoy makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, portrayed again by Nicholas Hoult.
* Hank McCoy appears in &quot;Dark Phoenix&quot;, portrayed again by Nicholas Hoult. After his teammate Jean Grey&#x27;s powers escalate to uncontrollable levels, leading to her accidentally killing Mystique, an incensed McCoy turns to Magneto for help in killing Grey. When the D&#x27;Bari attacks Earth for her powers, McCoy and Magneto join forces with the X-Men to repel the aliens. Following this, Xavier leaves McCoy in charge of Xavier&#x27;s School for Gifted Youngsters while he takes a leave of absence.
* Beast was meant to appear in a self-titled spin-off film, which was in development and would have seen Nicholas Hoult reprise the role once more before it was canceled.
* An alternate universe variant of Hank McCoy / Beast makes a cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene of &quot;The Marvels&quot; (2023), portrayed again by Kelsey Grammer. This version works with Maria Rambeau / Binary to investigate incursions, which they theorize are caused by individuals from adjacent realities.

<text>Stephen Gray (December 1666 – 7 February 1736) was an English dyer and astronomer who was the first to systematically experiment with electrical conduction. Until his work in 1729 the emphasis had been on the simple generation of static charges and investigations of the static phenomena (electric shocks, plasma glows, etc.). Gray showed that electricity can be conducted through metals and that it appeared on the surfaces of insulators.

==Early life==

Gray was born in Canterbury, Kent, and after some basic schooling, he was apprenticed to his father (and later his elder brother) in the cloth-dyeing trade. His interests lay with natural science and particularly with astronomy; he managed to educate himself in these developing disciplines, mainly through wealthy friends in the district, who gave him access to their libraries and scientific instruments. Science was very much a rich man&#x27;s hobby at this time.

He ground his own lenses and constructed his own telescope, and with this instrument he made a number of minor discoveries (mainly in the area of sunspots), gaining a reputation for accuracy in his observations. Some of his reports were published by the Royal Society through the agency of a friend, Henry Hunt, who was a member of the Society&#x27;s secretarial staff.

==Introduction to Flamsteed==
Some of Gray&#x27;s output came to the notice of John Flamsteed, a relative of some Kent friends of Gray and the first English Astronomer Royal, who was building the new Royal Greenwich Observatory. Flamsteed was attempting to construct a detailed and accurate star-map of the heavens, in the hope that this would eventually solve the problem of longitude determination for ocean navigators. Gray helped him with many of the observations and calculations (possibly without being paid).

Gray worked for a while on the second English observatory, being built at Cambridge, but it was badly managed by Newton&#x27;s friend and associate, Roger Cotes; the project finally collapsed, leaving Gray with little option but to return to his dyeing trade in Canterbury. Suffering from ill health, before long he was in London assisting John Theophilus Desaguliers, an acolyte of Isaac Newton and occasionally one of the Royal Society&#x27;s demonstrators. Desaguliers acted as a scientific consultant, giving lectures around the country and on the Continent about new scientific discoveries; he also ran a boarding house for visiting gentlemen with scientific interests. Gray was not paid by Desaguliers but provided with accommodation in exchange for his ability to discuss scientific subjects with the boarders.

Desaguliers&#x27; boarding house was demolished to make way for Westminster Bridge, and poverty intervened for Gray. In 1720, through the efforts of John Flamsteed and Sir Hans Sloane (later President of the Royal Society) he managed to obtain a pensioned position at the Charterhouse, a home for destitute gentlemen who had served their country, also linked to a boys&#x27; school. During this time he began experimenting with static electricity again, using a glass tube as a friction generator.

==Conduction discoveries==

One night, in his Charterhouse rooms, he noticed that the cork at the end of his tube (needed to keep moisture and dust out) generated an attractive force on small pieces of paper and chaff when the tube was rubbed. Normally the cork would not have carried an electrical charge, but climatic conditions and variations in the materials meant that the cork was accumulating charge. When he extended the cork by inserting a small stick of fir, the charge manifested itself at the end of the stick, and then on an ivory ball (perforated with a hole), he had stuck on the end. He tried longer sticks, and finally added a length of an oily hemp pack-thread connected to the ivory ball. In the process, he had discovered that the &quot;electric virtue&quot; was not just a &#x27;static&#x27; phenomenon (like a local pin-prick), but rather a fluid-like substance that would carry over distance. The terminating ivory ball would still act to attract light objects in the same way as the electrified glass tube.

Over the next few days, he extended the reach of his thread-wire (he only had a short piece of wire, and did not understand the significance of metal as a conductor) and found that it would carry from his balcony down into the courtyard below. He discovered that electricity would travel around bends in the thread and that it appeared unaffected by gravity. He was also able to transmit charges to metal objects (poker, tongs, kettle, etc.) which were generally regarded in those days as &#x27;non-electrics&#x27; because they couldn&#x27;t generate or hold a static charge. He also discovered that silk would not carry the &#x27;virtue&#x27;, while the thicker pack-thread and wire could.

Then between 30 June and 2 July 1729 while in Kent he extended this first electrical network and made many new discoveries. On a visit to the Reverend Granville Wheler, a wealthy friend, member of the Royal Society and Flamsteed&#x27;s relative, the two men extended the conduction experiments through pack-thread laced up and down the length of a large gallery in Wheler&#x27;s manor house, Otterden Place in Kent. In the process, Gray and Wheler discovered the importance of insulating their thread &#x27;conductor&#x27; from earth contact (the wall of the house) by using silk for suspension. They noticed that if a wire was used to support the pack-thread, all the &#x27;electrical virtue&#x27; leaked away. Initially, they thought the difference was due to the relative thicknesses of the silk, thread and wire, but later they realised that silk itself was much less conducting than the wire—so they used only silk to support (and thereby insulate) the hemp pack-thread used as their main conductor.

The next day they dropped the thread from the house tower to the garden and then extended it out across a paddock to a distance of 800 feet using paired garden-stakes with short spans of silk to keep the pack-thread from touching the ground. Wheler reported this to many of his Royal Society friends, and Gray wrote the full details in a letter to Desaguliers.

From these experiments came an understanding of the role played by conductors and insulators (names applied by Desaguliers). Two French scientists, Abbe Nollet and C.F. du Fay, visited Gray and Wheler in 1732, saw the experiment, and returned to France where du Fay formulated the first comprehensive theory of electricity called the &quot;two-fluid&quot; theory. This theory was championed by Nollet and accepted by most experimenters in Europe for a time; later it was refined and then superseded by the ideas of the English experimenters John Bevis and William Watson, who was in correspondence with Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s group in Philadelphia. They jointly devised a theory of a single-fluid/two-state: virtually, the super-abundance or absence of one fluid, which Watson later termed positive and negative. These ideas fitted the facts slightly better than the two-fluid concept, especially after the invention of the Leyden Jar, and this single-fluid theory eventually prevailed. We now know that both were almost equally incorrect.

=== Electrostatic induction ===

Gray went on to make more electrical discoveries, the most noticeable being electrical induction (creating an electrical charge in a suspended object without contact). In 1729 Gray showed that the &quot;Electrik Vertue&quot; of a glass tube can be conducted via a metal to another body. This was the first evidence that electricity was not a property of the glass tube but some kind of fluid. That same year Gray created two oaken cubes, one solid and one hollow; observing that these had the same electrical properties demonstrated that electricity was a surface rather than a bulk character.

This experiment was widely celebrated around Europe as the famous &quot;Flying Boy&quot; demonstration: a boy was suspended on silk cords, and then charged by Gray bringing his rubbed tube (static electric generator) close to the boy&#x27;s feet, but without touching. Gray showed that the boy&#x27;s face and hands still attracted the chaff, paper and other materials. Gray noted the crackling of &#x27;electric virtue&#x27; resembled lightning (as did other experimenters), foreshadowing the great discoveries of Benjamin Franklin half a century later.

== Copley award ==

When Sloane took over the Royal Society on Newton&#x27;s death, Gray belatedly received the recognition denied him previously. Gray was too poor to pay the dues, so he was not a member of the Royal Society, and many of his experiments had been taken up and became part of the demonstration repertoire of Desaguliers. There is also a story that he was denied recognition by the Newton faction within the Royal Society because of his links to Flamsteed (who was constantly in dispute with Isaac Newton), but this can be dismissed as highly unlikely: Newton had died in March 1727, nearly two years before Gray began his conduction experiments, and Hans Sloan, who ran the Royal Society after Newton&#x27;s death was a friend and financial supporter of Gray. The fact is that electricity was not considered that important at the time, and the Society&#x27;s magazine was not published for a couple of years due to financial constraints.

Sloan took an active part in promoting Gray, who received the Royal Society&#x27;s first Copley Medal in 1731 for his work on conduction and insulation, and also its second in 1732 for his induction experiments. In 1732 the Royal Society also admitted him as an honorary member; he died destitute a few years later, in 1736.

==After his death==
There is no monument to Gray and little recognition of what he achieved in his scientific discoveries. He is believed to be buried in a common grave in an old London cemetery, in an area reserved for pauper pensioners from the Charterhouse. In 2017 the School of Physical Sciences at the University of Kent, in Canterbury, initiated the Stephen Gray Lectures in his memory.

<doc id="392496" wikidata="Q206479" url="?curid=392496" title="Émile Lahoud">
<text>Émile Jamil Lahoud (born 12 January 1936) is a Lebanese politician who served as the 11th president of Lebanon from 1998 to 2007. During his presidency, the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon, that had lasted since 1982, ended in May 2000. He downplayed sectarianism and rearmed the Lebanese army, with help from Syria. Lahoud was closely allied to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, and was seen as playing a key role in preserving the occupation.

==Early life==
Émile Lahoud was born in Baabdat on 12 January 1936. However, his birthplace is given as Beirut by the Armed Forces. He is the youngest son of General and former minister Jamil Lahoud. His mother, Andrenee Bajakian, is of Armenian descent from the Armenian-populated village of Kesab in Syria. Lahoud&#x27;s older brother, Nasri Lahoud, was a judge who served as the military prosecutor general. Émile Lahoud is the nephew of Salim Lahoud who served as Lebanese foreign minister from 1955 to 1957.

Émile Lahoud is the great-grandson of Takouhi Kalebjian and Minas Sagerian on his maternal side who were from Adabazar, Ottoman Empire (now Adapazarı, Republic of Turkey). Adabazar is located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Istanbul on the Black Sea. Both Minas and Takouhi were massacred during the Armenian genocide which occurred under the rule of the Ottoman Empire during World War I.

in 2001, Lahoud visited Armenia. In his short working visit, he found time to walk around Yerevan and visit Tsitsernakaberd, the Armenian Genocide memorial complex, and laid a wreath at the eternal flame in the memory of the victims.

Lahoud received his elementary education at the Collège de la Sagesse, in Beirut, and his secondary education at Brummana High School in north Metn. He entered the military academy as a naval cadet in 1956 and studied there for one year. He then attended Dartmouth Naval College in the United Kingdom. He returned to the Lebanese military academy and graduated later as an ensign. In 1986, he took a navy engineering course at the Naval Engineering Academy in the United Kingdom. As a captain, he attended the U.S. Naval War College, in Newport, Rhode Island, graduating in 1973.

==Military life==
Lahoud became lieutenant junior grade on 18 September 1962 and lieutenant on 1 April 1969. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 January 1974 and to commander on 1 January 1976. He then began to serve as a Navy Engineer Staff Captain from 1 January 1980 and as a Navy Engineer Staff Rear Admiral from 1 January 1985. On 28 November 1989, he was promoted to Major Lieutenant General.

Although he was trained as a naval officer, Lahoud benefited from the appointment of his maternal cousin, General Jean Njeim, as army commander and was appointed to head the transportation section of the army&#x27;s fourth division in 1970. Although Njeim died in a helicopter crash in 1971, Lahoud steadily rose through the ranks of its officer corps. In 1980, he was appointed Director of Personnel in the Army Command. In 1983, he was given an administrative position at the Defense Ministry, where he was responsible for coordination between ministry officials and the Commander of the Lebanese Army, a position which was held by Michel Aoun in 1984.

In 1989, Lahoud was appointed to the post of Commander in chief of the army as part of Elias Hraoui&#x27;s Western and Arab backed government in West Beirut. As part of the Taef agreement – to extend the authority of the new Lebanese government in Lebanese Forces controlled areas – Lahoud sent General Elie Hayek to take control of Mount Lebanon North of Baabda. During his career as chief of the LAF, Lahoud allowed Lebanese&#x27;s security-military apparatus to be firmly controlled by Syria.

==Political career==
Lahoud ran for the presidency in 1998 after having amended the constitution to allow the army commander-in-chief to run for office. This amendment is believed to have been backed by Syria. His presidency was secured following the receipt of 118 votes from the 128-member Lebanese Parliament. When he became Lebanon&#x27;s president in 1998, he aligned himself with Hezbollah, and picked his own man as prime minister, Selim al-Hoss. This led to heightened tensions between Rafiq Hariri and Lahoud. The other significant move Lahoud made shortly after his presidency was a request that Syria remove Ghazi Kanaan, who was serving as Syria&#x27;s intelligence chief in Lebanon. Lahoud&#x27;s request was not granted.

During his term, Lahoud exerted more control over government decision-making than Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri or Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. In August 2001, he modified the limits on the executive authority of the presidency stipulated in the 1989 Ta&#x27;if Accord and ordered security forces to launch a massive arrest sweep against nationalist dissidents without informing Hariri and other cabinet ministers.

In 2004, his six-year presidential term was supposed to end. Syria, however, although initially hesitant about Lahoud&#x27;s candidacy, encouraged the extension of his term for three more years, regarding him as key to their control over Lebanon. The extension would be possible only if the constitution was amended. The Syrian leadership was reported to have threatened Hariri and others into endorsing the amendment. The intention to extend Lahoud&#x27;s term prompted significant domestic turmoil. Ultimately, Hariri and the parliamentary majority voted for the extension of Lahoud&#x27;s presidential term until November 2007, with 96 deputies voting in favor of the amendment against 29 who were opposed. However, four cabinet members resigned from office on 7 September 2004 in protest of the amendment: economy minister Marwan Hamadeh, culture minister Ghazi Aridi, environment minister Farès Boueiz and refugee affairs minister Abdullah Farhat.

On the other hand, both the Iranian government and Hezbollah viewed the extension of his term as a desirable development: Iranian President Mohammad Khatami telephoned his congratulations to Lahoud, and a delegation of top Hezbollah officials visited Lahoud to convey Nasrallah&#x27;s congratulations. The extension of Lahoud&#x27;s term is seen as a clear example of Syria&#x27;s control of Lebanese politics.

In a 2006 &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; interview, Lahoud argued that Hezbollah enjoys prestige in Lebanon, because it &quot;freed our country&quot;. He further stated that although Hezbollah is a small-scale organization, it stands up to Israel and voiced his respect for Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

In 2007, his presidential term ended. However, a new president was not immediately elected. Following a political deadlock which lasted for six months, the Lebanese parliament elected former army chief Michel Suleiman as president.

It was claimed that Lahoud spent much of his presidency term swimming and sunbathing at the Yarzeh Country Club minutes away from the presidential palace. Although there were high expectations from his own Christian Maronite community and the support of the military which he had commanded in the post-war period, the unpopular Lahoud developed a reputation as a weak leader by some, largely due to following Syria on most matters. In line with these views, Druze leader Walid Jumblatt publicly described Lahoud as a &quot;helpless ghost&quot; regarding his presidency.

==Personal life==
He married Andrée Amadouni in 1967 and they have three children: Karine (born 1969), the former spouse of Elias Murr, Emile (born 1975) and Ralph (born 1977).

The book &quot;Years of Resistance: The Mandate of Emile Lahood, the Former President of Lebanon&quot; by Karim Pakradouni, published in May 2012, reviews his political life and his impact on the contemporary history of Lebanon and the Middle East crisis.

He then went on to study at the University of Bristol (Diploma in English Legal Studies, 1986), Wolfson College, Cambridge (Development Studies, 1989), and Wye College (Agricultural Economics). He completed his studies in 1989, when he returned to Lesotho.

He was installed as the Principal Chief of Matsieng on 16 December 1989.

His coronation took place on 31 October 1997 at Setsoto Stadium. King Charles III (then the Prince of Wales) attended the ceremony.

On 1 December 2016, in Rome, King Letsie III was appointed as the Food and Agriculture Organization&#x27;s newest Special Ambassador for Nutrition by the Organization&#x27;s Director-General, José Graziano da Silva.

<doc id="392501" wikidata="Q139223" url="?curid=392501" title="Peter Maxwell Davies">
<text>Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (8 September 1934 – 14 March 2016) was an English composer and conductor, who in 2004 was made Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music.

As a student at both the University of Manchester and the Royal Manchester College of Music, Davies formed a group dedicated to contemporary music called the New Music Manchester with fellow students Harrison Birtwistle, Alexander Goehr, Elgar Howarth and John Ogdon. Davies&#x27;s compositions include eight works for the stage—from the monodrama &quot;Eight Songs for a Mad King&quot;, which shocked the audience in 1969, to &quot;Kommilitonen!&quot;, first performed in 2011—and ten symphonies, written between 1973 and 2013.

As a conductor, Davies was artistic director of the Dartington International Summer School from 1979 to 1984 and associate conductor/composer with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1992 to 2002, holding the latter position with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra as well.

==Early life and education==
Davies was born in Holly Street, Langworthy, Salford, Lancashire, and lived in Trafford Road before moving to Wyville Drive in Swinton. He was the son of Thomas Davies, a manufacturer of optical instruments, and his wife Hilda, an amateur painter. At age four, after being taken to a performance of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Gondoliers&quot;, he told his parents that he was going to be a composer.

He took piano lessons and composed from an early age. As a 14-year-old, he submitted a composition called &quot;Blue Ice&quot; to the radio programme &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; in Manchester. BBC producer Trevor Hill showed it to resident singer and entertainer Violet Carson, who said, &quot;He&#x27;s either quite brilliant or mad&quot;. Conductor Charles Groves nodded his approval and said, &quot;I&#x27;d get him in&quot;. Davies&#x27;s rise to fame began under the careful mentorship of Hill, who made him the programme&#x27;s resident composer and introduced him to various professional musicians both in the UK and Germany.

After attending Leigh Boys Grammar School, Davies studied at the University of Manchester and at the Royal Manchester College of Music (amalgamated into the Royal Northern College of Music in 1973), where one of his teachers was Hedwig Stein; his fellow students included Harrison Birtwistle, Alexander Goehr, Elgar Howarth and John Ogdon. Together they formed New Music Manchester, a group committed to contemporary music. After graduating in 1956, he studied on an Italian government scholarship for a year with Goffredo Petrassi in Rome.

In 1959, Davies became Director of Music at Cirencester Grammar School. He left in 1962 after securing a Harkness Fellowship at Princeton University (with the help of Aaron Copland and Benjamin Britten); there he studied with Roger Sessions, Milton Babbitt and Earl Kim. He then moved to Australia, where he was Composer in Residence at the Elder Conservatorium of Music, University of Adelaide, 1965–66.

==Career==

Davies was known as an &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of the 1960s, whose music frequently shocked audiences and critics. One of his overtly theatrical and shocking pieces was &quot;Eight Songs for a Mad King&quot; (1969), in which he used &quot;musical parody&quot; by taking a canonical piece of music – Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; – and subverting it to explore the periods of madness of King George III.

In 1966 Davies returned to the United Kingdom and moved to the Orkney Islands, initially to Hoy in 1971, and later to Sanday. Orkney (particularly its capital, Kirkwall) hosts the St Magnus Festival, an arts festival founded by Davies in 1977. He frequently used the festival to premiere new works (often played by the local school orchestra).

Davies was artistic director of the Dartington International Summer School from 1979 to 1984. From 1992 to 2002 he was associate conductor/composer with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, a position he also held with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra, and he has conducted a number of other prominent orchestras, including the Philharmonia, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. In 2000 Davies was Artist in Residence at the Barossa Music Festival when he presented some of his music theatre works and worked with students from the Barossa Spring Academy. Davies was also Composer Laureate of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, for whom he wrote a series of ten &quot;Strathclyde Concertos&quot;.

Davies was one of the first classical composers to open a music download website, &quot;MaxOpus&quot; (in 1996).

He was awarded a number of honorary doctorates, including Honorary Doctor of Music from Oxford University in July 2005. He had been President of Making Music (The National Federation of Music Societies) since 1989. Davies was made a CBE in 1981 and knighted in 1987. He was appointed Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music in March 2004 but, in a break from the tradition of lifetime tenure, his appointment was limited to ten years. He was made a Freeman of the City of Salford August 2004. On 25 November 2006, he was appointed an Honorary Fellow of Canterbury Christ Church University at a service in Canterbury Cathedral. He was visiting professor of composition at the Royal Academy of Music, and in 2009 became an Honorary Fellow of Homerton College, Cambridge. Davies received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2002

==Personal life==
Davies was known by friends and colleagues as &quot;Max&quot;, after his middle name &quot;Maxwell&quot;, and was openly homosexual throughout his adult life.

Although he sometimes set sacred texts, Davies was an atheist.

In 2005 his house on Sanday was raided by police, who removed parts of a whooper swan (a protected species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act) which Davies had been planning to eat; he stated he had found the swan electrocuted beneath power lines.

In 2007, a controversy arose regarding an intended civil partnership with Davies&#x27;s partner of five years, builder Colin Parkinson. They were told that the ceremony could not take place on the Sanday Light Railway. The couple later abandoned their plans but remained together until a break-up in 2012.

The same year, the composer&#x27;s &quot;MaxOpus&quot; site became temporarily unavailable after the arrest in June 2007 of Michael Arnold (one of MaxOpus&#x27;s directors) on fraud charges arising from money missing from Davies&#x27;s business accounts. In October 2008 Arnold and his wife Judith (Davies&#x27;s former agent) were charged with the theft of almost £450,000. In November 2009, Michael Arnold was sentenced to 18 months in jail on a charge of false accounting. Charges of stealing against the couple, to which both had pleaded not guilty, were dropped when the prosecution offered no evidence. MaxOpus was relaunched earlier in 2009.

Davies was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2014 New Year Honours for &quot;services to music&quot;. He died from leukaemia on 14 March 2016, aged 81, at his home in Orkney.

==Political views==
Davies was a life-long supporter of gay rights and a vice-president of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality.

Davies had a keen interest in environmentalism. He wrote &quot;The Yellow Cake Revue&quot;, a collection of cabaret-style pieces that he performed with actress Eleanor Bron, in protest at plans to mine uranium ore in Orkney. It is from this suite of pieces that his famous instrumental &quot;chanson triste&quot; &quot;Farewell to Stromness&quot; is taken. The slow, walking bass line that pervades the &quot;Farewell&quot; portrays the residents of the town of Stromness having to leave their homes as a result of uranium contamination. The &quot;Revue&quot; was first performed at the St Magnus Festival, in Orkney, by Bron, with the composer at the piano, in June 1980. Stromness, the second largest town in Orkney, would have been two miles from the uranium mine&#x27;s core, and the centre most threatened by pollution, had the proposed development been approved.

In the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003 he marched in protest, and he was an outspoken critic of the Labour governments of both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Davies&#x27;s appointment to the post of Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music was initially controversial, as he had expressed republican views. However, he confirmed in 2010 that contact with the Queen had converted him to monarchism. He told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;I have come to realise that there is a lot to be said for the monarchy. It represents continuity, tradition and stability.&quot;

He was a member of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) and the Incorporated Society of Musicians.

==Music==

Davies was a prolific composer who wrote in a variety of styles and idioms over his career, often combining disparate styles in one piece. Early works include the &quot;Trumpet Sonata&quot; (1955), written while he was at college, and his first orchestral work, &quot;Prolation&quot; (1958), written while under the tutelage of Petrassi. Early works often use serial techniques (for example &quot;Sinfonia&quot; for chamber orchestra, 1962), sometimes combined with Mediaeval and Renaissance compositional methods. Fragments of plainsong are often used as basic source material to be adapted and developed. His &quot;O Magnum Mysterium&quot; (1960) features on several YouTube clips, and was, for some time, his most talked-about work.

Pieces from the late 1960s take up these techniques and tend towards the experimental and to have a violent character. These include &quot;Revelation and Fall&quot; (based on a poem by Georg Trakl), the music theatre pieces &quot;Eight Songs for a Mad King&quot; and &quot;Vesalii Icones&quot;, and the opera &quot;Taverner&quot;. &quot;Taverner&quot;, again, shows an interest in Renaissance music, taking as its subject the composer John Taverner, and consisting of parts resembling Renaissance forms. The orchestral piece &quot;St Thomas Wake&quot; (1969) shows this interest and is a particularly obvious example of Davies&#x27;s polystylism. It combines a suite of foxtrots (played by a twenties-style dance band), a pavane by John Bull and Davies&#x27;s &quot;own&quot; music (the work is described by Davies as a &quot;Foxtrot for orchestra on a pavan by John Bull&quot;). Many works from this period were performed by the Pierrot Players, which Davies founded with Harrison Birtwistle in 1967; they were reformed as the Fires of London in 1970, then disbanded in 1987.

After his move to Orkney, Davies often drew on Orcadian or more generally Scottish themes in his music, and has sometimes set the words of Orcadian writer George Mackay Brown. He has written a number of other operas, including &quot;The Martyrdom of St Magnus&quot; (1976), &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; (1980, his most popular opera), and &quot;The Doctor of Myddfai&quot; (1996). The ambitious, nihilistic parable &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1987), which includes parts for a rock band, was nearly twenty years in gestation.

Davies was interested in classical forms, completing his first symphony in 1976. He wrote ten numbered symphonies – a symphonic cycle of the Symphonies Nos.1–7 (1976–2000), a Symphony No. 8 titled the &quot;Antarctic&quot; (2000), a Ninth Symphony (premiered on 9 June 2012 by the Royal Liverpool Symphony Orchestra), a Tenth Symphony (see below), a Sinfonia Concertante (1982), as well as the series of ten &quot;Strathclyde Concertos&quot; for various instruments (pieces born out of his association with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, 1987–1996). In 2002, he began work on a series of string quartets for the Maggini String Quartet to record on Naxos Records (the &quot;Naxos Quartets&quot;). The whole series was completed in 2007, and was viewed by the composer as a &quot;novel in ten chapters&quot;.

Davies&#x27;s lighter orchestral works have included &quot;Mavis in Las Vegas&quot; (a title inspired by a Las Vegas hotelier&#x27;s mishearing of &quot;Maxwell Davies&quot; and registering him as &quot;Mavis&quot;) and &quot;An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise&quot; (which features the bagpipes), as well as a number of theatre pieces for children and a good deal of music with educational purposes. Additionally he wrote the scores for Ken Russell&#x27;s films &quot;The Devils&quot; and &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. His Violin Concerto No. 2 received its UK premiere on 8 September 2009 (the composer&#x27;s 75th birthday) in the Royal Albert Hall, London, as part of the 2009 season of The Proms.

On 13 October 2009, his string sextet &quot;The Last Island&quot; was first performed by the Nash Ensemble at Wigmore Hall in a 75th birthday concert for the composer. His Symphony No. 10 had its world premiere at the Barbican Hall, London on 2 February 2014.

&quot;Throstle&#x27;s Nest Junction&quot;, opus 181 (1996), and &quot;A Spell for Green Corn – The MacDonald Dances&quot; both had their London premiere at the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale studios, broadcast live on Radio 3 with the composer&#x27;s participation on 19 June 2014, in celebration of his 80th birthday. The music was played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, and presented by Petroc Trelawny.
The last months of his life, as he struggled with terminal illness, showed continuing creative power and energy. There was The Hogboon (op. 335, a children&#x27;s opera), the epiphany carol A Torrent of Gold, and the short choral work The Golden Solstice. He was working on a String Quartet (op.338) at the time of his death; only the first movement was completed.

<text>Hugh III (; – 24 March 1284), also called Hugh of Antioch-Lusignan and the Great, was the king of Cyprus (as Hugh III) from 1267 and king of Jerusalem (as Hugh I) from 1268. Born into the family of the princes of Antioch, he effectively ruled as regent for underage kings Hugh II of Cyprus and Conrad III of Jerusalem for several years. Prevailing over the claims of his cousin Hugh of Brienne, he succeeded both young monarchs upon their deaths and appeared poised to be an effective political and military leader.

As the first king of Jerusalem to reside in the kingdom since the 1220s, Hugh tried to restore the royal domain, reassert royal authority over the increasingly independent mainland vassals, and prevent further loss of territory to the Egyptian Mamluks. Marital alliances brought to him steadfast loyalty of the most powerful noble families, the Ibelins and the Montforts, but his efforts on the mainland were doomed to failure by the hostility of the Venetian merchants and the Knights Templar. His insular vassals, on the other hand, resented his determination to deploy Cypriot armies in defense of the Crusader states. In 1275 he failed to establish himself as regent of the County of Tripoli.

Most problematically, Hugh&#x27;s right to the throne of Jerusalem was challenged by his aunt Maria of Antioch, who sold her claim to Charles I of Anjou in 1277. With the support of the Venetians and the Templars, Charles promptly took Acre, the last city on the mainland that belonged directly to the king. After two unsuccessful attempts to regain Acre, Hugh died in Tyre, a mainland city held by the loyal Montforts. He was succeeded by his son John I.

==Background==
Hugh was the son of Isabella of Cyprus and Henry of Antioch, who married 1233. Isabella was the sister of King Henry I of Cyprus, while Hugh&#x27;s father was the youngest son of Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch. Hugh&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Alice of Champagne, was an unsuccessful claimant to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. As the heir presumptive to her grandnephew King Conrad II of Jerusalem, she was selected to rule the kingdom as regent in 1243. She died in 1246 and the regency passed to her son, Henry I of Cyprus, passing over the claim of her half-sister Melisende of Cyprus. King Henry ruled the mainland kingdom as regent until his death in 1253.

Hugh&#x27;s mother brought him up along with his cousin Hugh of Brienne, son of her deceased older sister, Maria. He married Isabella, a member of the House of Ibelin, who were the leading nobility of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The marriage, or at least a betrothal, took place in 1255, when a dispensation was issued. Hugh was handsome and charming, but disadvantaged by his bad temper and tactlessness.

==Regency==


 

 
 

Hugh&#x27;s mother, Isabella, was the aunt of the young King Hugh II of Cyprus and his closest relative of royal blood. The king&#x27;s mother, Plaisance of Antioch, ruled on his behalf as regent until her death in 1261. Isabella then stood to assume the regency as Hugh II&#x27;s heir presumptive. She ceded the regency to her son, Hugh of Antioch, who proved to be an able ruler. As Hugh II was also heir presumptive to King Conrad III of Jerusalem, who lived in Europe, he was entitled to govern the Kingdom of Jerusalem as regent. But since he was a minor, that regency needed to be exercised by his next of kin, and Isabella accepted that role in 1263.

Isabella died in 1264, and a dispute arose between Hugh of Brienne and Hugh of Antioch. The former claimed that he should now exercise the regency in Jerusalem because his mother was older than Hugh of Antioch&#x27;s. But, as regent of Cyprus, Hugh of Antioch could contribute more militarily to the dwindling mainland kingdom, and was better connected, being the first cousin of Prince Bohemond VI of Antioch as well as being married into the powerful Ibelin family. The High Court of Jerusalem ruled that, since the contenders were equally close relatives of the young king, the elder of them should have priority, and that was Hugh of Antioch. Being chosen as regent effectively marked Hugh of Antioch as the heir presumptive of Hugh II.

As regent, Hugh considered it his duty to defend the Crusader states. He was the first ruler of Cyprus in over a decade to deploy a Cypriot army in defense of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. His army, however, came too late to prevent the Mamluk ruler of Egypt, Baibars, from conquering Caesarea Maritima, Arsur, Haifa, Safed, Toron, and Chastel Neuf. Hugh likely focused on reinforcing the defence of Acre, the sole remaining royal city on the mainland.

==Reign==
===Accessions===

14-year-old King Hugh II died in December 1267, not having reached majority, and was duly succeeded as king of Cyprus by his cousin and regent Hugh of Antioch (Hugh III). Hugh III&#x27;s coronation took place in the Cathedral of Saint Sophia in Nicosia on 25 December 1267. In May 1268 the new king sailed to Acre to be recognized as the formal regent, and thus heir presumptive, of Conrad III of Jerusalem. The High Court was prepared to accept him, but he was surprised to find his claim challenged by his aunt Maria of Antioch. She insisted that she had the better claim to regency due to being a nearer relative of Conrad; whereas Hugh was a great-grandchild of their common ancestor, Queen Isabella I of Jerusalem, Maria was a grandchild. Maria&#x27;s case was legally stronger and, unlike Hugh, she had come prepared for debate. Hugh, however, was a more desirable choice, as he was a man, experienced in government, and with troops at disposal. Earlier in 1268 Baibars had conquered Jaffa, Beaufort, and Antioch, which prompted the High Court to rule in Hugh&#x27;s favour.

On 29 October 1268, Conrad was executed in Naples by the orders of Charles I of Anjou, who had conquered Conrad&#x27;s Kingdom of Sicily. Hugh thus became king of Jerusalem too. Instead of appointing a bailli to rule his new kingdom on his behalf, Hugh divided his time between Cyprus and Acre. For the first time since the 1220s the mainland kingdom had a resident monarch.

===Policy===
The barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem had grown independent from royal authority during the reigns of the absentee kings. Hugh tried to improve the system of government, introducing an inner council and the use of a privy seal, both likely imports from Cyprus. The regents had alienated much of the royal domain through legally tenuous grants, which became invalid on Hugh&#x27;s accession. The most notable cases were the grants of the lordships of Arsur to the Knights Hospitaller, Sidon to the Knights Templar, and Tyre to Philip of Montfort. Hugh refused to accept this as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, but was willing to compromise to find solutions. His policy centred on fostering close relations with the Montforts, a powerful family which held the important city of Tyre. With Philip he reached an agreement providing that Hugh&#x27;s sister, Margaret, would marry Philip&#x27;s son John, to whom Philip would cede Tyre, and that Hugh would enfeoff John and his descendants by Margaret with Tyre. The agreement enabled Hugh to be crowned, despite Maria&#x27;s protests, on 24 September 1269 by the bishop of Lydda in the Cathedral of Tyre, where kings and queens of Jerusalem had been crowned since the loss of the city of Jerusalem in 1187.

In June 1271, Acre became exposed when Baibars conquered the Montfort Castle to its north-east. He immediately made an unsuccessful attempt at raid on Cyprus. At that time, the English prince Edward took a small army of about 1,000 men on a a crusade to the Latin East, arriving in Acre on 9 May 1271. Edward was soon disillusioned by the uncooperativeness of the local Christians. Baibars&#x27; failed attack on their island had disturbed Cypriot knights, who refused Hugh&#x27;s summons to serve on the mainland. They argued that the king could not expect them to fight for him outside Cyprus. Edward was called on to arbitrate. Their disobedience was humiliating for Hugh. It was decided that the knights could be commanded to serve abroad for four months each year if led by the king or his son. Edward helped Hugh raid Baibars&#x27; territory, and early in 1272 Hugh secured a truce, after which Acre remained at peace until 1291. Edward left on 16 June 1272.

The only lay fief on the mainland other than Tyre was Beirut, held by Isabella of Ibelin. Her husband, Hamo le Strange, distrusted King Hugh and put her and her fief under Baibar&#x27;s protection on his deathbed in 1273. As a female vassal, Isabella was legally required to marry one of three candidates presented to her by the king. Wishing to attract a capable knight to the East by offering her hand in marriage, Hugh took Isabella to Cyprus. Baibars demanded that she be returned to Beirut, and as the High Court offered no support, Hugh relented. The king did not resume control over Beirut until long after Baibars died. Despite some successes, in the end Hugh found it impossible to be more than &quot;king of Acre&quot;, as Muslim writers called him.

Bohemond VI, the last prince of Antioch, died in 1275, leaving two children, Bohemond VII and Lucia. Bohemond VII inherited the County of Tripoli from his father, but he was a minor. King Hugh arrived in Tripoli to claim regency as the closest adult scion of the ruling family. Bohemond VII&#x27;s mother, Sibylla of Armenia, had already established herself as regent, however, as was her right according to family custom. Hugh found no support in Tripoli. He only won a minor diplomatic victory when he negotiated with Baibars a truce covering Latakia, preserving the last remnant of the Principality of Antioch.

===Baronial opposition===

Hugh succeeded in mending the rifts between his lay vassals, the Ibelins and the Montforts, but the merchants of Venice and Genoa were irreconcilable. The Venetians in particular were aggrieved by his preferential treatment of the Genoese. The Templars and the Teutonic Knights objected to his own rapprochement with Philip of Montfort, while the commune of Acre resented the renewed royal involvement in its affairs and the favour shown to Tyre. Though he disliked him, the grand master of the Templars, Thomas Berard, never openly challenged Hugh. But William of Beaujeu, elected to succeed Thomas Berard in 1273, proved determined to undermine the king.

Hugh&#x27;s chief problem, however, was the persistence of his aunt Maria in claiming the throne of Jerusalem. Hugh sent procurators to answer her appeal to the Holy See in 1273, but she was already entertaining the sale of her claim to Charles of Anjou, whose ambition to dominate the Mediterranean Hugh had feared since 1269. Charles had the support of William of Beaujeu, his kinsman. As the ruler of Sicily and brother of the celebrated crusader King Louis IX of France, he rivalled what Hugh could offer militarily and diplomatically. Charles was also personally hostile to Hugh, encouraging Maria&#x27;s claims to Jerusalem and Hugh of Brienne&#x27;s to Cyprus.

Indignant at the opposition he faced, Hugh suddenly packed up his belongings and left Acre for good in October 1276. The final straw was the purchase of a village near Acre by the Templars, for which they deliberately did not seek the king&#x27;s approval and ignored his complaints. The Templars and the Venetians were pleased to see him go, but the decision stunned the Hospitallers, the Teutonic Knights, and the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, Thomas of Lentino. They sent delegates to Tyre, where the king had retired with the intention to sail to Cyprus, begging him to at least appoint a bailli. It took the intercession of his brother-in-law John of Montfort to make the angry king appoint an administrator, Balian of Ibelin. King Hugh immediately embarked and went to Cyprus, from where he justified his action to Pope John XXI.

The sale of Maria&#x27;s claim to Charles was concluded, with papal approval, in March 1277. Within weeks Charles&#x27;s representative Roger of San Severino arrived in Acre to claim government, facing no opposition from Hugh. Roger proclaimed Charles king of Jerusalem and demanded that the barons do homage to him as Charles&#x27;s bailli. To preserve a sense of legality, the barons twice asked Hugh to absolve them from their allegiance to him, but he refused to answer. The holders of the most important lordships, John of Tyre and Isabella of Beirut, continued to recognize Hugh as their legitimate king.

===Struggles for Acre===
Hugh attempted twice to reoccupy Acre but was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1279 he brought a large Cypriot army to Tyre, hoping that a display of strength and bribery would be enough to restore his authority over the city. John of Montfort was on his side, but William of Beaujeu&#x27;s enduring opposition to Hugh frustrated the plan. Upon returning to Cyprus, he seized the Templars&#x27; properties and destroyed their fortifications in reprisal. The Templars complained to the pope, who asked Hugh to restore their property, but he declined. Though restricted since 1277 in his ability to support the mainland against the Mamluks, Hugh may have planned to assist the Mongols in their attempted invasion of the Mamluk-held Levant.

1282 saw the recall of Roger of San Severino due to a major uprising on Sicily against Charles, as well as the death of Isabella of Beirut and the consequent passing of her lordship to her sister, Eschiva, whose husband, Humphrey of Montfort, was a close friend of Hugh&#x27;s. Thus encouraged to try again to retake Acre, Hugh sailed from Cyprus in late July 1283 with his sons Henry and Bohemond. Instead of landing at Acre, Hugh was blown to Beirut, where he was welcomed on 1 August. While his army marched to Tyre, they were ambushed by Muslim raiders, whom the king believed to have been incited by the Templars. Hugh reached Tyre by sea, encountering bad omens: his standard fell into the sea, and the cross carried by the assembled clergy accidentally cracked the skull of his Jewish court physician. Hugh waited in vain to be welcomed to Acre. Charles&#x27;s new bailli in Acre, Odo Poilechien, had just concluded a truce with the Mamluks, and Hugh may have feared their intervention if he attacked.

The king lost his most promising son, Bohemond, on 3 November 1283. An even more serious blow was the death of his friend and brother-in-law, John of Montfort. The Cypriots left him after the agreed period of four months expired, but Hugh remained in Tyre, where he died on 24 March 1284. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, John I, who died the next year and was followed by another son, Henry II.

==Issue==
With his wife, Isabella of Ibelin, Hugh had eleven children:

<doc id="392519" wikidata="Q217498" url="?curid=392519" title="Álvaro Obregón">
<text>Álvaro Obregón Salido (; 19 February 1880 – 17 July 1928) was a Mexican military general, inventor and politician who served as the 46th President of Mexico from 1920 to 1924. Obregón was re-elected to the presidency in 1928 but he was assassinated before he could take office.

Born in Navojoa, Sonora, Obregón joined the Revolution after the February 1913 coup d&#x27;état that brought General Victoriano Huerta to the presidency. Obregón supported Sonora&#x27;s decision to follow Governor Venustiano Carranza as leader of the northern revolutionary coalition, the Constitutionalist Army, against the Huerta regime. Obregón quickly became the Constitutionalist Army&#x27;s most prominent general, along with Pancho Villa. Carranza appointed Obregón commander of the revolutionary forces in northwestern Mexico. The Constitutionalists defeated Huerta in July 1914, and the Federal Army dissolved in August. In 1915, the revolution entered a new phase of civil war between the Conventionists led by Emiliano Zapata and Villa versus Obregón and Carranza. Obregón was made leader of the Constitutionalist army and defeated Villa, but lost his right arm. In 1917, the Constitution of Mexico went into effect and the Conventionists forces were quickly getting defeated by Obregón and the Constitutionalist Army. Carranza stepped down from the presidency and designated Ignacio Bonillas to succeed him. Obregón and other Sonoran generals Plutarco Elías Calles and Adolfo de la Huerta ousted Bonillas and Carranza under the Plan of Agua Prieta. Obregón was elected to the presidency in 1920 with overwhelming popular support.

Obregón&#x27;s presidency saw educational reform, the flourishing of Mexican muralism, moderate land reform, and labor laws sponsored by the increasingly powerful Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers. In August 1923, he signed the Bucareli Treaty that clarified the rights of the Mexican government and U.S. oil interests and brought U.S. diplomatic recognition to his government. In 1923–24, Obregón&#x27;s finance minister, Adolfo de la Huerta, launched a rebellion when Obregón designated Plutarco Elías Calles as his successor. De la Huerta garnered support by many revolutionaries who were opposed to Obregón&#x27;s apparent emulation of Porfirio Díaz&#x27;s example. Obregón returned to the battlefield and defeated the rebellion. In his victory, he was aided by the United States with arms and planes that bombed de la Huerta&#x27;s supporters.

In 1924, Obregón&#x27;s fellow Northern revolutionary general and hand-picked successor, Plutarco Elías Calles, was elected president. Although Obregón ostensibly retired to Sonora, he remained influential under Calles. Calles pushed through constitutional reform to again make re-election possible, but not continuously. Obregón won the 1928 election. Before beginning his second term however, he was assassinated by José de León Toral during the Cristero War. Obregón&#x27;s political legacy is that of pragmatic centrism, allying with various factions of the revolution to accomplish his goals, with one historian describing him as &quot;Alvaro Obregón stood out as the organizer, the peacemaker, the unifier.&quot; His assassination precipitated a political crisis in the country, ultimately leading to Calles founding the National Revolutionary Party, later renamed the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which would dominate Mexican politics throughout the 20th century.

==Early years, 1880–1911==
Obregón was born in Siquisiva, Municipality of Navojoa, Sonora, the eighteenth child of Francisco Obregón and Cenobia Salido. Francisco Obregón had once owned a substantial estate, but his business partner supported Emperor Maximilian during the French intervention in Mexico (1862–1867), and the family&#x27;s estate was confiscated by the Liberal government in 1867. Francisco Obregón died in 1880, the year of Álvaro Obregón&#x27;s birth. The boy was raised in very straitened circumstances by his mother and his older sisters Cenobia, María, and Rosa. His mother&#x27;s family was locally prominent, owning haciendas and some held government positions during the Porfirio Díaz regime. Obregón benefited from his relationship with his more distinguished kin, though as an orphan, he was very much the poor relation. He had ambition to make his way in the world. One of his cousin&#x27;s on his mother&#x27;s side, Benjamin G. Hill became an important ally in the Mexican Revolution.

Obregón&#x27;s home state of Sonora was an isolated area with a border with the U.S. and there was frequent interchange with the U.S. and U.S. investment in Sonora. Sonora&#x27;s distance from the capital and lack of a direct railway line to the capital affected its late nineteenth-century development and its role in the Mexican Revolution. Sonora had direct railway connections to the U.S. and its economy was more closely tied to the U.S. than central Mexico, exporting cattle hides and most especially garbanzos to the U.S. Obregón&#x27;s family circumstances and the economic situation of the state made his entry into garbanzo farming a way to make a good living as a young man.

During his childhood, Obregón worked on the family farm and became acquainted with the indigenous Mayo people who also worked there and learned the language. His bilingualism served him well in his later military and political career, drawing both Mayos and Yaqui into his orbit. He attended a school run by his brother José in Huatabampo and received an elementary level formal education. However, his mind was &quot;active, inventive, and above all, practical.&quot; He spent his adolescence working a variety of jobs, before finding permanent employment in 1898 as a lathe operator at the sugar mill owned by his maternal uncles in Navolato, Sinaloa. Obregón&#x27;s experience as a skilled worker shaped his attitude toward the rights of labor, and &quot;gave him the sense of what a powerful political tool the workers&#x27; sense of rage could be.&quot;

In 1903, he married Refugio Urrea and in 1904, he left the sugar mill to sell shoes door-to-door, and then to become a tenant farmer. By 1906, he was in a position to buy his own small farm with a loan from his mother&#x27;s family, where he grew garbanzos. The next year was tragic for Obregón as his wife and two of his children died, leaving him a widower with two small children, who were henceforth raised by his three older sisters. In 1909, Obregón invented a garbanzo harvester and soon founded a company to manufacture these harvesters, complete with a modern assembly line. He successfully marketed these harvesters to garbanzo farmers throughout the Mayo Valley. Since garbanzos were an export crop, he lobbied for the extension of the railway line, to get his crop to market more efficiently. He also lobbied for irrigation works, to increase his farm&#x27;s output. Obregón entered politics in 1911 with his election as municipal president of the town of Huatabampo.

==Military career, 1911–1915==

===Early military career, 1911–1913===
Obregón expressed little interest in the Anti-Reelectionist movement launched by Francisco I. Madero in 1908–1909 in opposition to President Porfirio Díaz. When Madero called for an uprising against Díaz following the fraudulent 1910 elections, in November 1910 by issuing his Plan of San Luis Potosí, Obregón did not join the struggle against the Díaz regime. As a widowed parent of two small children and running a prosperous farm, Madero&#x27;s call to arms was not urgent for him. In his memoir, he regretted the delay.

Obregón became a supporter of Madero shortly after he won the presidential election of 1911. In March 1912, Pascual Orozco, a general who had fought for Madero&#x27;s cause to oust Díaz, launched a revolt against Madero after Madero ordered the fighters that toppled Díaz to disband, retaining the Federal Army that they had defeated. This revolt started in Chihuahua with the financial backing of Luis Terrazas, a former Governor of Chihuahua and the largest landowner in Mexico. In April 1912, Obregón volunteered to join the local Maderista forces, the Fourth Irregular Battalion of Sonora, organized under the command of General Sanginés to oppose Orozco&#x27;s revolt. Obregón&#x27;s unit was the largest in the state, and volunteered to go wherever needed. This Battalion supported federal troops under the command of Victoriano Huerta sent by Madero to crush Orozco&#x27;s rebellion. Within weeks of joining the Battalion, Obregón displayed signs of military genius. Obregón disobeyed his superior&#x27;s orders but won several battles by luring his enemies into traps, surprise assaults, and encircling maneuvers.

Obregón was quickly promoted through the ranks and attained the rank of colonel before resigning in December 1912, following the victory over Orozco (with Orozco fleeing to the United States).

Obregón had intended to return to civilian life in December 1912, but then in February 1913, the Madero regime was overthrown in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; (known to Mexican history as &quot;La decena trágica&quot;) orchestrated by Victoriano Huerta, Félix Díaz, Bernardo Reyes, and Henry Lane Wilson, the United States Ambassador to Mexico. Madero and his vice president were forced to resign, and were then assassinated. Huerta assumed the presidency.

Obregón immediately traveled to Hermosillo to offer his services to the government of Sonora in opposition to the Huerta regime. The Sonoran government refused to recognize the Huerta regime. In early March 1913, Obregón was appointed chief of Sonora&#x27;s War Department. In this capacity, he set out on a campaign, and in a matter of days had managed to drive federal troops out of Nogales, Cananea, and Naco. He soon followed up by capturing the port city of Guaymas. He squared off against federal troops in May 1913 at the battle of Santa Rosa through an encirclement of enemy forces. As commander of Sonora&#x27;s forces, Obregón won the respect of many revolutionaries who had fought under Madero in 1910–11, most notably Benjamín G. Hill.

===Fight against the Huerta regime, 1913–1914===
The Sonoran government was in contact with the government of Coahuila, which had also refused to recognize the Huerta regime and entered a state of rebellion. A Sonoran delegation headed by Adolfo de la Huerta traveled to Monclova to meet with the Governor of Coahuila, Venustiano Carranza. The Sonoran government signed on to Carranza&#x27;s Plan of Guadalupe, by which Carranza became &quot;primer jefe&quot; of the newly proclaimed Constitutional Army. On 30 September 1913, Carranza appointed Obregón commander-in-chief of the Constitutional Army in the Northwest, with jurisdiction over Sonora, Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua, and Baja California.
In November 1913, Obregón&#x27;s forces captured Culiacán, thus securing the supremacy of the Constitutional Army in the entire area of Northwestern Mexico under Obregón&#x27;s command.

Obregón and other Sonorans were deeply suspicious of Carranza&#x27;s Secretary of War, Felipe Ángeles, because they considered Ángeles to be a holdover of the old Díaz regime. At the urging of the Sonorans (the most powerful group in Carranza&#x27;s coalition following Obregón&#x27;s victories in the Northwest), Carranza downgraded Ángeles to the position of Sub-Secretary of War.

In spite of his demotion, Ángeles formulated the rebel grand strategy of a three-prong attack south to Mexico City: (1) Obregón would advance south along the western railroad, (2) Pancho Villa would advance south along the central railroad, and (3) Pablo González Garza would advance south along the eastern railroad.

Obregón began his march south in April 1914. Whereas Pancho Villa preferred wild cavalry charges, Obregón was again more cautious. Villa was soon at odds with Carranza, and in May 1914, Carranza instructed Obregón to increase the pace of his southern campaign to ensure that he beat Villa&#x27;s troops to Mexico City. Obregón moved his troops from Topolobampo, Sinaloa, to blockade Mazatlán, and then to Tepic, where Obregón cut off the railroad from Guadalajara, Jalisco, to Colima, thus leaving both of these ports isolated.

In early July, Obregón moved south to Orendaín, Jalisco, where his troops defeated federal troops, leaving 8000 dead, and making it clear that the Huerta regime was defeated. Obregón was promoted to major general. He continued his march south. Upon Obregón&#x27;s arrival in Teoloyucan, Mexico State, it was clear that Huerta was defeated, and, on 11 August, on the mudguard of a car, Obregón signed the treaties that ended the Huerta regime. On 16 August 1914, Obregón and 18,000 of his troops marched triumphantly into Mexico City. He was joined shortly by Carranza, who marched triumphantly into Mexico City on 20 August.

In Mexico City, Obregón moved to exact revenge on his perceived enemies. He believed that the Mexican Catholic Church had supported the Huerta regime, and he therefore imposed a fine of 500,000 pesos on the church, to be paid to the Revolutionary Council for Aid to the People.

He also believed that the rich had been pro-Huerta, and he therefore imposed special taxes on capital, real estate, mortgages, water, pavement, sewers, carriages, automobiles, bicycles, etc. Special measures were also taken against foreigners. Some of these were deliberately humiliating: for example, he forced foreign businessmen to sweep the streets of Mexico City.

===Relations with Villa, June–September 1914===
Although tensions between the conservative Carranza and more radical Pancho Villa grew throughout 1914, Obregón attempted to mediate between the two to keep the revolutionary coalition intact. Villa had created a number of diplomatic incidents and Carranza was worried that would invite further U.S. intervention, whose forces already occupied Veracruz. On 8 July 1914, Villistas and Carrancistas signed the Pact of Torreón, in which they agreed that after Huerta&#x27;s forces were defeated, 150 generals of the Revolution would meet to determine the future shape of the country. Carranza was angered by Villa&#x27;s insubordination, particularly ignoring the order not to take Zacatecas. For this reason Carranza refused to let Villa march into Mexico City in August. Villa had contacted Obregón following Villa&#x27;s capture of Zacatecas in June 1914, suggesting the two successful revolutionary generals could cooperate against the civilian Carranza. Obregón was not willing to do that at this point, preferring to try to keep the revolutionary coalition intact as long as possible. Obregón understood the danger that Villa presented to the Constitutionalists if the coalition was to fracture; he made two trips to Chihuahua in August and September 1914 to see Villa in person to try to mediate the situation between Villa and Carranza. During this period, Obregón got to know both Carranza and Villa well, which informed his later relations with them. Both trips to Villa were extremely risky for Obregón, placing himself in danger of being assassinated by Villa. In September, Villa and Carranza formally split, but Obregón positioned himself for the longer term.

During Obregón&#x27;s first meeting with Villa in late August, the two agreed that Carranza should declare himself interim president of Mexico, as mandated in Carranza&#x27;s Plan of Guadalupe when Huerta was defeated. Carranza refused to do so, since it would mean that he could not run for election as president. As the situation stood, Carranza was the head of an extra-legal government. Since the Constitutionalists supposedly fought for the restoration of constitutional government, Carranza was violating that in order to hold onto political power. Villa and Obregón further called on Carranza to appoint judges to the supreme court and establish a civilian judiciary. They also petitioned Carranza to establish councils at the federal and local levels that would then call elections. Obregón and Villa agreed that a new federal congress should make laws benefiting the poor. Since the revolutionary forces had destroyed the old Federal Army, a new military force came into being, the National Army. They agreed that members of the military should be barred from holding high political office. Villa and Obregón&#x27;s agreement also stipulated that any revolutionaries currently under arms must resign from the military and be ineligible for civilian office for six months. Unlike Carranza, who was positioning himself to be elected president and not violate the no re-election principle for which the Constitutionalists fought, Villa and Obregón were not angling for the presidency, but rather seeking to restore constitutional order. A further agreement between Villa and Obregón was that land reform should be dealt with immediately, since it was the reason that many joined the revolution. Both generals saw immediate action on land for revolutionary soldiers as a priority. Obregón returned to Mexico City and presented the petition to Carranza. Carranza rejected it, even though Obregón told him it would lead to an immediate break with Villa.

===Convention of the Winners, 1914===

Despite the break that came between Villa and Carranza, revolutionary leaders still attempted to resolve their differences and meet to chart the way forward. The Convention that the Carrancistas and Villistas had agreed to in the Treaty of Torreón went ahead at Aguascalientes on 5 October 1914. Carranza did not participate in the Convention of Aguascalientes because he was not a general, but, as a general, Obregón participated. The Convention soon split into two major factions: (1) the Carrancistas, who insisted that the convention should follow the promise of the Plan of Guadalupe and restore the 1857 Constitution of Mexico; and (2) the Villistas, who sought more wide-ranging social reforms than set out in the Plan of Guadalupe. The Villistas were supported by Emiliano Zapata, leader of the Liberation Army of the South, who had issued his own Plan of Ayala, which called for wide-ranging social reforms. For a month and a half, Obregón maintained neutrality between the two sides and tried to reach a middle ground that would avoid a civil war.

Eventually, it became clear that the Villistas/Zapatistas had prevailed at the convention; Carranza, however, refused to accept the convention&#x27;s preparations for a &quot;pre-constitutional&quot; regime, which Carranza believed was totally inadequate, and in late November, Carranza rejected the authority of the regime imposed by the convention. Forced to choose sides, Obregón sided with Carranza and left the convention to fight for the &quot;Primer Jefe&quot;. He had made many friends amongst the Villistas and Zapatistas at the convention and was able to convince some of them to depart with him. On 12 December 1914, Carranza issued his Additions to the Plan of Guadalupe, which laid out an ambitious reform program, including Laws of Reform, in conscious imitation of Benito Juárez&#x27;s Laws of Reform.

===War with the Conventionists, 1915===

Once again, Obregón was able to recruit loyal troops by promising them land in return for military service. In this case, in February 1915, the Constitutionalist Army signed an agreement with the &quot;Casa del Obrero Mundial&quot; (&quot;House of the World Worker&quot;), the labor union with anarcho-syndicalist connections which had been established during Francisco I. Madero&#x27;s presidency. As a result of this agreement, six &quot;Red Battalions&quot; of workers were formed to fight alongside the Constitutionalists against the Conventionists Villa and Zapata. This agreement had the side effect of lending the Carrancistas legitimacy with the urban proletariat.

Obregón&#x27;s forces easily defeated Zapatista forces at Puebla in early 1915, but the Villistas remained in control of large portions of the country. Forces under Pancho Villa were moving towards the Bajío; General Felipe Ángeles&#x27;s forces occupied Saltillo and thus dominated the northeast; the forces of Calixto Contreras and Rodolfo Fierro controlled western Mexico; and forces under Tomás Urbina were active in Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosí.

The armies of Obregón and Villa clashed in four battles, collectively known as the Battle of Celaya, the largest military confrontation in Latin American history before the Falklands War of 1982. The first battle took place on 6 April and 7 April 1915 and ended with the withdrawal of the Villistas. The second, in Celaya, Guanajuato, took place between 13 April and 15 April, when Villa attacked the city of Celaya but was repulsed. The third was the prolonged position battle of Trinidad and Santa Ana del Conde between 29 April and 5 June, which was the definitive battle. Villa was again defeated by Obregón, who lost his right arm in the fight.

Villa made a last attempt to stop Obregón&#x27;s army in Aguascalientes on 10 July but without success. Obregón distinguished himself during the Battle of Celaya by being one of the first Mexicans to comprehend that the introduction of modern field artillery, and especially machine guns, had shifted the battlefield in favor of a defending force. In fact, while Obregón studied this shift and used it in his defense of Celaya, generals in the World War I trenches of Europe were still advocating bloody and mostly failing mass charges.

===Obregón&#x27;s arm===

During the battles with Villa, Obregón had his right arm blown off. The blast nearly killed him, and he attempted to put himself out of his misery and fired his pistol to accomplish that. The aide de camp who had cleaned his gun had neglected to put bullets in the weapon. In a wry story he told about himself, he joined in the search for his missing arm. &quot;I was helping them myself, because it&#x27;s not so easy to abandon such a necessary thing as an arm.&quot; The searchers had no luck. A comrade reached into his pocket and raised a gold coin. Obregón concluded the story, saying &quot;And then everyone saw a miracle: the arm came forth from who knows where, and come skipping up to where the gold &quot;azteca&quot; [coin] was elevated; it reached up and grasped it in its fingerslovinglyThat was the only way to get my lost arm to appear.&quot; The arm was subsequently embalmed and then displayed in the monument to Obregón at the Parque de la Bombilla, on the site of where he was assassinated in 1928. Obregón always wore clothing tailored to show that he had lost his arm in battle, a visible sign of his sacrifice to Mexico.

== Early political career, 1915–1920 ==

===Carranza&#x27;s Minister of War, 1915–1916===
In May 1915, Carranza had proclaimed himself the head of what he termed a &quot;Preconstitutional Regime&quot; that would govern Mexico until a constitutional convention could be held. Obregón had petitioned Carranza as early as 1914 to assume the title of interim president, which he refused to do since it would have precluded his running for the presidency. Obregón had chosen loyalty to Carranza rather than throwing his lot in with Villa and Zapata, and Carranza appointed Obregón as Minister of War in his new cabinet. Although they were ostensibly allies, Carranza and Obregón&#x27;s relationship was tense, but neither wished an open break at this point. Obregón took the opportunity to build his own power base with laborers and the agrarian movement, as well as with politicians in high places. As Minister of War, Obregón determined to modernize and professionalize the Mexican military thoroughly. In the process, he founded a staff college and a school of military medicine. He also founded the Department of Aviation and a school to train pilots. Munitions factories were placed under the direct control of the military.

===Break with Carranza, 1917–1920===
In September 1916, Carranza convoked a Constitutional Convention, to be held in Querétaro, Querétaro. He declared that the liberal 1857 Constitution of Mexico would be respected, though purged of some shortcomings. When the Constitutional Convention met in December 1916, it had only 85 conservatives and centrists close to Carranza&#x27;s brand of liberalism, a mainly civilian group known as the &quot;bloque renovador&quot; (&quot;renewal faction&quot;). There were 132 progressive delegates, who insisted that land reform and labor rights be embodied in the new constitution. Obregón was not himself a delegate, but the progressives sought out his backing for the inclusion in the constitution of guarantees for the goals for which the peasantry and organized labor had fought. Obregón now broke with Carranza and threw his considerable weight behind the radicals. He met with radical legislators, as well as the intellectual leader of the radicals, Andrés Molina Enríquez, and came out in favor of all their key issues. In particular, unlike Carranza, Obregón supported the land reform mandated by Article 27 of the constitution. He also supported the heavily anticlerical Articles 3 and 130 that Carranza opposed.

The revolutionary Constitution of 1917 was drafted and ratified quickly. Villistas and Zapatistas were excluded from its drafting, but both factions remained militarily a threat to the Constitutionalist regime and its new constitution. Shortly after swearing his allegiance to the new Constitution, Obregón resigned as Minister of War and retired to Huatabampo to resume his life as a garbanzo farmer. He organized the region&#x27;s garbanzo farmers in a producer&#x27;s league and briefly entertained the idea of going to France to fight on the side of the Allies in World War I. He made a considerable amount of money in these years, and also entertained many visitors. As the victorious general of the Mexican Revolution, Obregón remained enormously popular throughout the country.

By early 1919, Obregón had determined to use his immense popularity to run in the presidential election that would be held in 1920. Carranza announced that he would not run for president in 1920, but refused to endorse Obregón, instead endorsing an obscure diplomat, Ignacio Bonillas, a civilian that Carranza could likely control. Obregón announced his candidacy in June 1919. He ran as the candidate for the &quot;Partido Liberal Constitutionalista&quot; (PLC), a party uniting most of the revolutionary generals. Obregón&#x27;s cousin and comrade in arms, General Benjamin Hill, was a founding member of the party. He coordinated Obregón&#x27;s support in Mexico City and reached out to the Zapatista general Genovevo de la O. Carranza had Emiliano Zapata assassinated in 1919, weakening but not eliminating the Zapatista threat to the capital.

In August, Obregón concluded an agreement with Luis Napoleón Morones and the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers, promising that if elected, he would create a Department of Labor, install a labor-friendly Minister of Industry and Commerce, and issue a new labor law. Obregón began to campaign in earnest in November 1919.

Carranza was far more conservative than Obregón and once duly elected as president, he did not implement the revolutionary elements of the 1917 constitution. Carranza attempted to concentrate power in his own hands. Obregón had anticipated that Carranza would encourage him to run for the presidency in 1920, but no word came from him. Obregón informed Carranza by telegram that he would be running for the presidency. Obregón&#x27;s formal announcement was distributed widely, and Carranza saw Obregón&#x27;s condemnation of &quot;evils of the Carranza regime.&quot; Stung by Obregón&#x27;s repudiation, Carranza sought a presidential candidate from the state of Sonora, choosing the Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Ignacio Bonillas. When Obregón heard that his fellow Sonorense was Carranza&#x27;s chosen candidate, he said &quot;An excellent person, my &quot;paisano&quot; Bonillas. A man who is serious, honest, and hardworking. The world has lost a magnificent bookkeeper.&quot;

At Carranza&#x27;s behest, the Senate stripped Obregón of his military rank, a move which only increased Obregón&#x27;s popularity. Then, Carranza orchestrated a plot in which a minor officer claimed that Obregón was planning an armed uprising against the Carranza regime. Obregón was forced to disguise himself as a railwayman and flee to Guerrero, where one of his former subordinates, Fortunato Maycotte, was governor.

On 20 April 1920, Obregón issued a declaration in the town of Chilpancingo accusing Carranza of having used public money in support of Bonillas&#x27;s presidential candidacy. He declared his allegiance to the Governor of Sonora, Adolfo de la Huerta, in revolution against the Carranza regime.

On 23 April, the Sonorans issued the Plan of Agua Prieta, which triggered a military revolt against the president. Obregón&#x27;s Sonoran forces were augmented by troops under General Hill and the Zapatistas led by Gildardo Magaña and Genovevo de la O.

The revolt was successful and Carranza was deposed, after Obregon&#x27;s forces captured Mexico City on 10 May 1920 On 20 May 1920, Carranza was killed in the state of Puebla in an ambush led by General Rodolfo Herrero as he fled from Mexico City to Veracruz on horseback.

For six months, from 1 June 1920 to 1 December 1920, Adolfo de la Huerta served as provisional president of Mexico until elections could be held. When Obregón was declared the victor, de la Huerta stepped down and assumed the position of Secretary of the Treasury in the new government.

==President of Mexico, 1920–1924==
Obregón&#x27;s election as president essentially signaled the end of the violence of the Mexican Revolution. The death of Lucio Blanco in 1922 and the assassination of Pancho Villa in 1923 would eliminate the last remaining obvious challenges to Obregón&#x27;s regime. He pursued what seemed to be contradictory policies during his administration.

===Educational reforms and cultural developments===
Obregón appointed José Vasconcelos (Rector of the National Autonomous University of Mexico who had been in exile 1915–1920 because of his opposition to Carranza) as his Secretary of Public Education. Vasconcelos undertook a major effort to construct new schools across the country. Around 1,000 rural schools and 2,000 public libraries were built.

Vasconcelos was also interested in promoting artistic developments that created a narrative of Mexico&#x27;s history and the Mexican Revolution. Obregón&#x27;s time as president saw the beginning of the art movement of Mexican muralism, with artists such as Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, and Roberto Montenegro invited to create murals expressive of the spirit of the Mexican Revolution on the walls of public buildings throughout Mexico.

Obregón also sought to shape public perceptions of the Revolution and its place in history by staging elaborate celebrations in 1921 on the centenary of Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain. There had been such celebrations in 1910 by the Díaz regime, commemorating the start of the insurgency by Miguel Hidalgo. 1921 provided a date for Obregon&#x27;s government to shape historical memory of independence and the Revolution. After a decade of violence during the Revolution, the centennial celebrations provided an opportunity for Mexicans to reflect on their history and identity, as well as to enjoy diversions in peacetime. For Obregón, the centennial was a way to emphasize that revolutionary initiatives had historical roots and that like independence, the Revolution presented new opportunities for Mexicans. Obregón &quot;intended to use the occasion to shore-up popular support for the government, and, by extension, the revolution itself.&quot; Unlike the centennial celebrations in 1910, the one of 1921 had no monumental architecture to inaugurate.

===Labor relations===
Obregón kept his August 1919 agreement with Luis Napoleón Morones and the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers (CROM) and created a Department of Labor, installed a labor-friendly Minister of Industry and Commerce, and issued a new labor law.
Morones and CROM became increasingly powerful in the early 1920s and it would have been very difficult for Obregón to oppose their increased power. Morones was not afraid to use violence against his competitors, nearly eliminating the General Confederation of Workers in 1923.

CROM&#x27;s success did not necessarily translate to success for all of Mexico&#x27;s workers, and Article 123 of the Constitution of Mexico was enforced only sporadically. Thus, while CROM&#x27;s right to strike was recognized, non-CROM strikes were broken up by the police or the army. Also, few Mexican workers got Sundays off with pay, or were able to limit their workday to eight hours.

===Land reform===
Land reform was more extensive under Obregón than it had been under Carranza. Obregón enforced the constitutional land redistribution provisions, and in total, 921,627 hectares of land were distributed during his presidency. However, Obregón was a successful commercial garbanzo farmer in Sonora, and &quot;did not believe in socialism or in land reform&quot; and was in agreement with Madero and Carranza that &quot;radical land reform might very well destroy the Mexican economy and lead to a return to subsistence agriculture.&quot;

===Relations with Catholic Church===
Many leaders and members of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico were highly critical of the 1917 constitution. They especially criticized Article 3, which forbade religious instruction in schools, and Article 130, which adopted an extreme form of separation of church and state by including a series of restrictions on priests and ministers of all religions to hold public office, canvass on behalf of political parties or candidates, or to inherit from persons other than close blood relatives.

Although Obregón was suspicious of the Catholic Church, he was less anticlerical than his successor, Plutarco Elías Calles, would be. Calles&#x27;s policies would lead to the Cristero War (1926–29). For example, Obregón sent Pope Pius XI congratulations upon his election in 1922 and, in a private message to the pope, emphasized the &quot;complementarity&quot; of the aims of the Catholic Church and the Mexican Revolution.

In spite of Obregón&#x27;s moderate approach, his presidency saw the beginnings of clashes between Catholics and supporters of the Mexican Revolution. Some bishops campaigned actively against land reform and the organization of workers into secular unions. Catholic Action movements were founded in Mexico in the wake of Pius XI&#x27;s 1922 encyclical &quot;Ubi arcano Dei consilio&quot;, and supporters of the Young Mexican Catholic Action soon found themselves in violent conflict with CROM members.

The most serious diplomatic incident occurred in 1923, when Ernesto Filippi, the Apostolic Nuncio to Mexico, conducted an open air religious service although it was illegal to hold a religious service outside a church. The government invoked Article 33 of the constitution and expelled Filippi from Mexico.

===Mexico-U.S. relations===

As president, one of Obregón&#x27;s top priorities was securing US diplomatic recognition of his regime, to resume normal Mexico–United States relations. Although he rejected the U.S. demand that Mexico rescind Article 27 of the constitution, Obregón negotiated a major agreement with the United States, the Bucareli Treaty of August 1923 that made some concessions to the US in order to gain diplomatic recognition. It was particularly helpful when the Mexican Supreme Court, in a case brought by Texas Oil, declared that Article 27 did not apply retroactively. Another important arena in which Obregón resolved issues with the U.S. and other foreign governments was the Mexican-United States General Claims Commission. Finance Minister Adolfo de la Huerta signed a deal in which Mexico recognized a debt of $1.451  million to international bankers. Finally, at the Bucareli Conference, Obregón agreed to an American demand that Mexico would not expropriate any foreign oil companies, and in exchange, the U.S. recognized his government. Many Mexicans criticized Obregón as a sellout (&quot;entreguista&quot;), including Adolfo de la Huerta for his actions at the Bucareli Conference.

===De la Huerta rebellion, 1923–1924===
In 1923, Obregón endorsed Plutarco Elías Calles for president in the 1924 election in which Obregón was not eligible to run. Finance Minister Adolfo de la Huerta, who had served as interim president in 1920 before he stepped down after the election of Obregón, joined a rebellion against Obregón and his chosen successor, Calles. De la Huerta believed Obregón was repeating Carranza&#x27;s mistake of imposing his own candidate on the country. De la Huerta accepted the nomination of the Cooperativist Party to be its candidate in the presidential elections. De la Huerta then joined and gave his name to a major military uprising against Obregón. Over half of the army joined De la Huerta&#x27;s rebellion, with many of Obregón&#x27;s former comrades in arms now turning on him. Rebel forces massed in Veracruz and Jalisco. In a decisive battle at Ocotlán, Jalisco, Obregón&#x27;s forces crushed the rebel forces. Diplomatic recognition by the United States following the signing of the 1923 Bucareli Treaty was significant in Obregón&#x27;s victory over rebels. The U.S. supplied Obregón arms and also sent 17 U.S. planes, which bombed rebels in Jalisco. Obregón hunted down many of his former comrades in arms, including Gen. Salvador Alvarado and Fortunato Maycotte and had them executed. De la Huerta was among those who went into exile. Following the crushing of the rebellion, Calles was elected president, and Obregón stepped down from office.

==Later years, 1924–1928==

Following the election of Calles as president, Obregón returned to Sonora to farm. He led an &quot;agricultural revolution&quot; in the Yaqui Valley, where he introduced modern irrigation. Obregón expanded his business interests to include a rice mill in Cajeme, a seafood packing plant, a soap factory, tomato fields, a car rental business, and a jute bag factory.

Obregón remained in close contact with President Calles, whom he had installed as his successor, and was a frequent guest of Calles at Chapultepec Castle. This prompted fears that Obregón was intending to follow in the footsteps of Porfirio Díaz and that Calles was merely a puppet figure, the equivalent of Manuel González. These fears became acute in October 1926, when the Mexican Congress repealed term limits, thus clearing the way for Obregón to run for president in 1928.

Obregón returned to the battlefield for the period October 1926 to April 1927 to put down a rebellion led by the Yaqui people. This was ironic because Obregón had first risen to military prominence commanding Yaqui troops, to whom he promised land, and the 1926–27 Yaqui rebellion was a demand for land reform. Obregón probably participated in this campaign to prove his loyalty to the Calles government, to show his continued influence over the military, and to protect his commercial interests in the Yaqui Valley, which had begun to suffer as a result of the increasing violence in the region.

==Re-election and assassination==
Obregón formally began his presidential campaign in May 1927. CROM and a large part of public opinion were against his re-election, but he still counted on the support of most of the army and of the National Agrarian Party.

Two of Obregón&#x27;s oldest allies, General Arnulfo R. Gómez and General Francisco Serrano, opposed his re-election. Serrano launched an anti-Obregón rebellion and was ultimately assassinated. Gómez later called for an insurrection against Obregón, but was soon killed as well.
Obregón won the 1928 Mexican presidential election, but months before assuming the presidency he was assassinated. Calles&#x27; harsh treatment of Roman Catholics had led to a rebellion known as the Cristero War, which broke out in 1926. As an ally of Calles, Obregón was hated by Catholics and was assassinated in La Bombilla Café on July 17, 1928, shortly after his return to Mexico City, by José de León Toral, a Roman Catholic opposed to the government&#x27;s anti-Catholic policies. Obregón was not as fiercely anticlerical as Calles and had not imposed the anticlerical provisions of the 1917 constitution when he was president. Toral&#x27;s subsequent trial resulted in his conviction and execution by firing squad. A Capuchin nun named María Concepción Acevedo de la Llata, &quot;Madre Conchita&quot;, was implicated in the case and was thought to be the mastermind behind Obregón&#x27;s murder. León Toral sought retribution for the execution of Miguel Pro, who was falsely convicted of attempting to assassinate Obregón a year prior.

==Honors==
Álvaro Obregón was awarded Japan&#x27;s Order of the Chrysanthemum at a special ceremony in Mexico City. On November 26, 1924, Baron Shigetsuma Furuya, Special Ambassador from Japan to Mexico, conferred the honor on the President.

== Inventions ==
In 1909, Obregón invented a garbanzo harvester and soon founded a company to manufacture these harvesters, complete with a modern assembly line. He successfully marketed these harvesters to garbanzo farmers throughout the Mayo Valley. Since garbanzos were an export crop, he lobbied for the extension of the railway line, to get his crop to market more efficiently. He also lobbied for irrigation works, to increase his farm&#x27;s output.

==Legacy and posthumous recognition==
Although Obregón was a gifted military strategist during the Revolution and decisively defeated Pancho Villa&#x27;s División del Norte at the Battle of Celaya and went on to become President of Mexico, his posthumous name recognition and standing as a hero of the Revolution is nowhere near that of Villa&#x27;s or Emiliano Zapata&#x27;s. There is no posthumous cult of Obregón as there is to those two losing revolutionary leaders. On the 1945 anniversary of Obregón&#x27;s assassination, the official ceremony attracted few attendees.

As president, he successfully gained recognition from the United States in 1923, settled for a period the dispute with the U.S. over oil via the Bucareli Treaty, gain full rein to his Secretary of Public Education, José Vasconcelos, who expanded access to learning for Mexicans by building schools, but also via public art of the Mexican muralists. Perhaps as with Porfirio Díaz, Obregón saw himself as indispensable to the nation and had the Constitution of 1917 amended so that he could run again for the presidency in Mexico. This bent and, in many people&#x27;s minds, violated the revolutionary rule &quot;no re-election&quot; that had been enshrined in the constitution.

His assassination in 1928 before he could take the presidential office created a major political crisis in Mexico, which was solved by the creation of the National Revolutionary Party by his fellow Sonoran, General and former President Plutarco Elías Calles.

An imposing monument to Álvaro Obregón is located in the Parque de la Bombilla in the San Ángel neighborhood of southern Mexico City. It is Mexico&#x27;s largest monument to a single revolutionary and stands on the site where Obregón was assassinated. The monument held Obregón&#x27;s severed, and over the years, increasingly deteriorating right arm that he lost in 1915. The monument now has a marble sculpture of the severed arm, after the arm itself was incinerated in 1989. Obregón&#x27;s body is buried in Huatabampo, Sonora, rather than the Monument to the Revolution in downtown Mexico City where other revolutionaries are now entombed. In Sonora, Obregón is honored with an equestrian statue, where he is shown as a vigorous soldier with two arms.

In Sonora, the second largest city, Ciudad Obregón, is named for the revolutionary leader. Obregón&#x27;s son Álvaro Obregón Tapia served one term as the governor of Sonora as a candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, founded following Obregón&#x27;s assassination. The Álvaro Obregón Dam, built near Ciudad Obregón, became operational during the gubernatorial term of Obregón&#x27;s son.

Obregón is honored in the name of a genus of small cactus indigenous to Mexico – &quot;Obregonia denegrii&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In the novel &quot;The Friends of Pancho Villa&quot; (1996) by James Carlos Blake, Obregón is a major character.

Obregón is also featured in the novel &quot;Il collare spezzato&quot; by Italian writer Valerio Evangelisti (2006).

Obregón&#x27;s legacy and lost limb are the subjects of Mexican-American singer-songwriter El Vez&#x27;s &quot;The Arm of Obregón&quot;, from his 1996 album &quot;G.I. Ay! Ay! Blues&quot;.

<doc id="392525" wikidata="Q5357854" url="?curid=392525" title="Electricity sector in Norway">
<text>The electricity sector in Norway relies predominantly on hydroelectricity. A significant share of the total electrical production is consumed by national industry.

==Production and consumption==

Average annual hydropower generation capacity in 2019 was around 131 TWh, about 95% of total electricity production.

Of the total production in 2011 of 128 TWh; 122 TWh was from hydroelectric plants, 4795 GWh was from thermal power, and 1283 GWh was wind generated. In the same year, the total consumption was 114 TWh. Hydro production can vary 60 TWh between years, depending on amount of precipitation, and the remaining hydro potential is about 34 TWh.

In 2016, the Norwegian government published a white paper regarding their future energy intentions through 2030. This announcement emphasized four main goals, which were improving security in the supply of their power, improving the efficiency of their renewables, making their energy more efficient, and more environment- and climate-sensitive, and fostering economic development and value through fiscally responsible and renewable technology.

The annual electricity consumption was about 26-27 MWh per inhabitant during 2004-2009 when the European union (EU15) average in 2008 was 7.4 MWh. Norway’s consumption of electricity was over three times higher per person compared to the EU 15 average in 2008. The domestic electricity supply promotes use of electricity, and it is the most common energy source for heating floors and hot water.

== Electricity per person and by power source ==

== Transmission ==

Statnett is the transmission system operator in Norway, operating 11,000 km of high power lines. There are plans to upgrade the western grid from 300 to 420 kV at a cost of 8 billion NOK, partly to accommodate cables to Germany and England.

Norway has an open electric market, integrated with the other Nordic countries over the Synchronous grid of Northern Europe. Export and import is routine over the direct power links to Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands. The market is handled by Nord Pool, and has 5 price zones in Norway. Financial future contracts are traded at NASDAQ OMX. Many of the hydroelectric plants in Norway are easily adjustable and can adapt well to variations in demand, and hence in price, but frequency stability is not satisfactory, and Statnett works with producers to minimize sudden changes in power flow. On a normal day, when price is low during nighttime, Norway normally imports power, and exports during daytime when the price is higher. Maintaining the grid in the harsh Norwegian nature is a compromise between stability desires and economy, and outages are expected in these circumstances. The IT-nett, about 70% of the grid, is not grounded.

West of Oslo, there is a small single-phase AC power grid operated with 16.7 Hz frequency for power supply of electric railways.

==Price==
In some years, a combination of high power prices in the market and less than usual rainfall renders the power system more vulnerable to power shortages. So far consumers in Norway have noted this by paying a higher price for electrical power during winter, however still a low price in international terms. Copious snow- and rain-fall in the mild winters of 2013-15 led to sharply lower prices, which was 26.7 øre per kWh in 2015.

New connections to other countries could stabilize available power levels and reduce price swings, however as these areas are more expensive, average price may rise in Norway. Grid strengthening may cost a few billion kroner.

== Mode of production ==

=== Hydroelectricity ===

Hydroelectric power is the main mode of electricity production. Norway is known for its particular expertise in the development of efficient, environment-friendly hydroelectric power plants. Calls to power Norway principally through hydropower emerged as early as 1892, coming in the form a letter by the former Prime Minister Gunnar Knutsen to parliament. Ninety percent of hydropower capacity is publicly owned and distributed across municipalities and counties. Nationwide installed capacity of hydropower amounted to 33.8 GW in 2015. The maximum working volume of hydrologic storage power plants is 85 TWh, whereas the average seasonal cycle is 42 terawatt-hours (TWh). In 2015, hydroelectricity generated 144 TWh and accounted for 95.8% of the national electricity demand. In European markets, it is the single largest producer of hydropower. According to the IEA, Norway generated 4.3 percent of the worldwide hydropower in 2008 and ranked 6th for that year, behind China, Canada, Brazil, the United States and Russia.

Part of the reason that so much of Norway’s electricity can be generated from hydropower is due to the natural advantage of its topography, with abundant steep valleys and rivers. Due to climate change, the region is currently experiencing heavier rainfall and is projected to receive more in the future, further increasing its capacity for hydropower.

===Wind power===
Wind power capacity was at the end of 2019 2444 MW producing 5.5 TWh, an increase of about 780 MW (2.5 TWh) in 2019.

In 2021, 64 wind farms had total installed wind power capacity of 4,649 MW with 706 MW of onshore power being added in 2021. Electricity produced in 2021 being 11.8 TWh or 8.5% of Norway&#x27;s needs.

=== Solar power ===
Solar PV capacity in Norway reached 616 MW in 2023, up from just 11 MW in 2013.

Effective 2024, a 2023 law passed by parliament requires solar power on new government buildings. The same law sets a target of 8 terawatt hours (TWh) of solar electricity generation by 2030, which equates to 5% of total 2022-2023 generation levels. For comparison, solar power produced 0.1% of Norway&#x27;s electricity generation in 2023.

Solar companies include Elkem Solar and NorSun. Renewable Energy Corporation REC was a solar power company with headquarters in Norway and Singapore. Elkem Solar was part of Norwegian Elkem. Orkla Group sold it with $2 billion in January 2011 to a Chinese chemical company China National Bluestar head office in Beijing. NorSun is a private solar cell producer.

=== Coal power ===
On the island of Svalbard about 0.108 TWh of electricity and heat is produced annually, in two coal fired power plants. The coal is mined on the island, where the surplus of coal (2/3 of production) is exported.

=== Other types ===
Norway has around 3 power plants burning natural gas, depending on how they are counted: Mongstad 280 MW CHP, Kårstø 420 MW (now closed), and Tjeldbergodden 150 MW (unused). They are rarely used, as hydropower is usually cheaper.

==Export/Import==
Norway has imported up to 10% of its electricity production during 2004-2009. According to IEA, in 2015, Norway exports about 15% of its electricity generation and imports about 5%, and the net electricity export was 14.645 TWh. In 2021, exports were 24.7 TWh and imports 7.6 TWh, mostly from Sweden.

Norway and Sweden&#x27;s grids have long been connected across the 1630 km long border. A 1 GW 420 kV high-voltage link between Nea River station in Norway and Järpen (Järpströmmen station at Indalsälven river) in Sweden was commissioned in 2009. Beginning in 1977 the Norwegian and Danish grids were connected across the Skagerrak with 500 MW, growing to 1,700 MW in 2015. Norway&#x27;s grid is connected to the Netherlands across the North Sea since 2008 with the 580-kilometre 700 MW High-voltage direct current cable NorNed. The slightly shorter but with 1400 megawatt twice as powerful NordLink HVDC undersea cable connection to Northern Germany began operation in 2021, more or less replacing the Brokdorf Nuclear Power Plant which was shut down at the end of 2021, and helping Norway save hydro power when Germany has a surplus of renewable energy.

The North Sea Link HVDC Norway to Great Britain cable was opened in October 2021, while the Scotland–Norway interconnector NorthConnect is on hold due to Norwegian policy.

<text>The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia was a state formed in the Middle Ages by Armenian refugees, who were fleeing the Seljuk invasion of Armenia. It was initially founded by the Rubenian dynasty, an offshoot of the larger Bagratid family that at various times held the thrones of Armenia and Georgia. While the Rubenian rulers were initially regional princes, their close ties with the Western world after the First Crusade saw the principality recognised as a kingdom under Leo I by the Holy Roman Empire in 1198. The Rubenid dynasty fell in 1252 after the death of the last Rubenid monarch Isabella, and her husband Hethum I became sole ruler, beginning the Hethumid dynasty. After the death of Leo IV in 1341 his cousin was elected to succeed him as Constantine II, the first king of the Lusignan dynasty. The kingdom fell at the beginning of Leo V&#x27;s reign to the Mamluks, and henceforth title holders were only claimants to the throne. Charlotte of Cyprus ceded the throne to the House of Savoy in 1485, and the title fell out of use until after 1861.

==Kings and queens==
==Claimants==
===Potential claimants today===
The claim to the title passed to the House of Savoy, who were granted it by Charlotte in 1485. The Savoyard dynasts maintained their claim to the title &quot;King of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia&quot; as late as the 20th century.

In 1880, a former Maronite priest Kalfa Narbei declared that he was a descendant of Guy de Lusignan and styled himself as the Prince of Lusignan of Cyprus, of Jerusalem and of Armenia. He took the name Guy de Lusignan and title of Prince. He started offering self-styled chivalric orders. After the death of Guy/Kalfa Narbei in 1905, his wife Marie&#x27;s lover became the alleged Grand Master and called himself Comte d&#x27;Alby de Gratigny. He became involved in a fake art scandal in 1910.

<text>Nauruan indigenous religion is an indigenous religion of the Nauruans.

==Worldview==
An offering to the female deity Eijebong was made. Dead spirits are believed to be invoked through trances by a medium, and those spirits were said to be living in the island of Buitani. Believers say that the sky and the earth were created by a spider called Areop-Enap.

==Deities==
===Eigigu===
Eigigu is a girl from Nauruan mythology, who is said to be the wife of the moon (maramen).

===Detora===
Detora is a boy in Nauruan mythology, who became the king of the sea.

===Areop-Enap===
===Eyouwit===
A young girl who lived in the sky.

==Decline==
There are very few, if any, people on the island who still subscribe to this religion, because of the dominant belief of Christianity imposed upon them by Christian colonization.
Main sources for attestations of the religion in its old form comes from sources written by German ethnologist Paul Hambruch in 1914 and 1915 (available in German here: volume 1, 
volume 2), which was not well received by German missionary Alois Kayser.

<text>Mohammed Jamal Khalifa ()
(1 February 1957 – 31 January 2007) was a Saudi businessman from Jeddah who married one of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s sisters. He was accused of funding terror plots and groups in the Philippines in the 1990s while head of the International Islamic Relief Organization branch there. He was murdered in Madagascar in 2007.

==Biography==
Khalifa trained with Osama Bin Laden in the mujahideen camps in Afghanistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.

===Philippines===
Khalifa came to the Philippines in 1987 or 1988. He was the first head of the International Islamic Relief Organization’s Philippine branch, and also the IIRO&#x27;s regional director for all of Southeast Asia.

Khalifa married a local woman, Alice &quot;Jameelah&quot; Yabo, and frequently exited and entered the country for &quot;business&quot; reasons. Yabo was the sister of Ahmad al-Hamwi, better known as Abu Omar.

According to Zachary Abuza, Khalifa established several charities and Islamic organizations in the Philippines ostensibly for charity and religious reasons, but which channelled money to extremist groups. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Filipino officials said Khalifa raised several hundred thousand dollars during his eight years in the Philippines, but most of the money (as much as 70 percent, according to Wahab Akbar, governor of the Basilan region where the Abu Sayyaf is based) was spent funding Islamic extremists like Abu Sayyaf. One example of his syphoning off of charitable funds, according to Newsweek, was his reporting to his &quot;Saudi sponsors&quot; that he had built 33 orphanages across the southern Philippines when in fact Khalifa had set up only one institution for orphans.

Khalifa founded the &quot;Benevolence International Corporation&quot; (BIC) in the Philippines in 1988, apparently to recruit people for the Afghan jihad against the Soviets. The BIC claimed to be an import-export company. In 1992, that group folded visible operations while another group known as the Islamic Benevolence Committee renamed itself to Benevolence International Foundation. What was left of the Benevolence International Corporation allegedly gave logistical support to terrorists, and has been accused of assisting the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the Bojinka plot (of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Ramzi Yousef to blow up 11 American jetliners killing 4,000 people in early 1995).

Another organization founded by Khalifa, the International Relations and Information Center, has been called (by Zachary Abuza) the &quot;primary funding mechanism&quot; for the Bojinka plan. Money was embezzled from the International Relations and Information Center through the bank account of Omar Abu Omar, an employee at the center, to an account under the name of Adel Sabah, an alias of Ramzi Yousef.

According to the Philippines National Security Advisor, Roilo Golez, Khalifa &quot;built up the good will of the community through charity and then turned segments of the population into agents.&quot; A Philippines intelligence report claimed that &quot;the IIRO which claims to be a relief institution is being utilized by foreign extremist as a pipeline through which funding for the local extremists are being coursed through&quot;.

A defector from the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) told authorities &quot;The IIRO was behind the construction of Mosques, school buildings and other livelihood projects&quot; but only &quot;in areas penetrated, highly influenced and controlled by the Abu Sayyaf.&quot; According to the defector &quot;Only 10 to 30% of the foreign funding goes to the legitimate relief and livelihood projects and the rest go to terrorist operations.&quot;

According to Rohan Gunaratna, Khalifa dispatched at least one Filipino youth to Tripoli, Libya, on an eight-month training course and on his return in 1990 urged him to join ASG. He sent other ASG members for religious training to the International Islamic University in Pakistan and for military training with Al Qaeda&#x27;s International Islamic Brigade in Afghanistan, their visits being financed by IIRO.

From the Philippines, he &quot;established links with Islamists in Iraq, Jordan, Turkey, Russia, Malaysia, the UAE, Romania, Lebanon, Syria, Pakistan, Albania, the Netherlands and Morocco, enabling the ASG to develop relationships with terrorist groups&quot; throughout the Middle East and Asia.

According to Abuza, while Philippine government claimed to have shut down all the charities run by Khalifa to finance Abu Sayyaf, a senior Philippine intelligence official complained to him, &quot;We could not touch the IIRO&quot; because &quot;intense diplomatic pressure&quot; from Saudi Arabia kept the charity open. &quot;Their most important source of leverage was the visas and jobs for several hundred thousand Filipino guest workers&quot;, which they could withhold if the Philippine government angered them.

===Deportation and release===
The first record U.S. authorities had of Khalifa reportedly came in 1992, when his alias &quot;Barra&quot; appeared on a bomb-making manual carried by Ahmed Ajaj who entered the United States on a false passport.

On 1 December 1994, Khalifa met Mohamed Loay Bayazid, the president of Benevolence International Foundation, in the United States. Khalifa and Bayazid were arrested on December 14, 1994, in Mountain View, California on charges related to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Khalifa was planning to fly to the Philippines.

When the FBI looked inside Khalifa&#x27;s luggage, they found manuals in Arabic on training terrorists, which covered subjects such as bomb-making and other violent activities. Khalifa claims that his possession of the materials was innocent. They found a personal organizer with several contacts. One phone number was for Wali Khan Amin Shah, a member of the Manila cell, which was plotting Operation Bojinka at the time. There was also a listing for an unknown man, who might have been Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Khalifa was placed in solitary confinement and the contents of his luggage were logged and edited.

Khalifa was held without bail for several months, before being deported to Jordan. In Jordan, a court had convicted Khalifa in absentia for a string of theatre bombings. Khalifa faced a possible death sentence as a result. Khalifa first fought his deportation by suing the government.

On 6–7 January 1995, Operation Bojinka was discovered after a fire at Ramzi Yousef&#x27;s Manila apartment. Investigators found evidence related to the plot. Abdul Hakim Murad, who was arrested at the apartment, had five phone numbers pointing to Khalifa. They also found logs of phone calls to and from Khalifa before his arrest and contact information on Yousef&#x27;s computer.

Despite this evidence, forwarded to the United States from the Philippines in March 1995, suggesting Khalifa was funding the foiled Operation Bojinka plot, Khalifa was not arrested but his belongings were returned and he was deported to Jordan on May 5 by the INS as he requested. (Despite the fact that on 18 April, the conviction in Jordan was overturned as a key witness recanted his testimony.) In Jordan, a court acquitted Khalifa. Bayazid was also let go. Khalifa left for the Philippines and returned to Saudi Arabia. The US deported him to Lebanon where he had already been sentenced to death in absentia for conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts. He was re-tried and acquitted, then released to Saudi Arabia.

Khalifa was arrested in Saudi Arabia shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, but was released without charges being filed. Later that year, he publicly condemned Osama Bin Laden and publicly distanced himself from Al Qaeda.

===Death===
On 31 January 2007, the day before his 50th birthday, Khalifa was killed while visiting a gemstone mine he owned in Sakamilko, near the town of Sakaraha in southern Madagascar. Reports state that around 25 to 30 armed men raided Khalifa&#x27;s residence in the middle of the night, attacked him with various weapons, and removed his computer and other intelligence materials. His family came to believe that he was assassinated by operators from the Joint Special Operations Command.

<text>Mohammed Khalifa (born 10 July 1983) is a Canadian citizen who traveled to Islamic State-occupied territory, where he narrated Islamic State war videos.

Observers had long speculated that two important Islamic State war videos, &quot;Flames of War&quot; and &quot;Flames of War 2&quot;, were narrated by a Canadian. Khalifa was captured in a clash with the Syrian Democratic Forces in January 2019, and acknowledged he was the narrator.

The &quot;Flames of War&quot; was described as one of the most influential Islamic State war videos. It is 55 minutes long, much of the footage filmed with a GoPro style body-camera, worn by a fighter, who first digs in, then charges Syrian soldiers. Other footage records prisoners first being made to dig their own graves, then showing their brutal executions.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; hired three voice recognition experts, who had served as expert witnesses, Catalin Grigoras, Jeff M. Smith and Robert C. Maher, who all agreed recordings made when Rukmini Callimachi interviewed him matched the narration of the videos.

According to Charlie Winter, a counter-terrorism specialist from the International Center for the Study of Radicalization, &quot;His voice is the most recognizable English-speaking voice to have ever appeared in Islamic State propaganda.&quot; 
Winter called &quot;The Flames of War&quot;

According to Amarnath Amarasingam, of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, &quot;He is a symbol — the voice coming out of ISIS, speaking to the English-speaking world, for the better part of the last four to five years.&quot;

In October 2021, Khalifa was flown to Virginia and arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Prosecutors charged him with &quot;material terrorism support leading to death&quot;, alleging that he was responsible for publicising the infamous video of James Foley&#x27;s beheading. Raj Parekh, acting US attorney, described Khalifa as &quot;the voice behind the violence&quot;.

On December 10, 2021, Khalifa pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to a terrorist organization, resulting in death. He was sentenced to life in prison on 29 July 2022.

<doc id="392543" wikidata="Q1145696" url="?curid=392543" title="Dennis Eckersley">
<text>Dennis Lee Eckersley (born October 3, 1954), nicknamed &quot;Eck&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher and color commentator. Between 1975 and 1998, he pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Oakland Athletics, and St. Louis Cardinals. Eckersley had success as a starter, but gained his greatest fame as a closer, becoming the first of two pitchers in major league history to have both a 20-win season and a 50-save season in a career.

Eckersley was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2004 in his first year of eligibility. He previously worked with NESN as a part-time color commentator for Red Sox broadcasts, and has also worked for Turner Sports as a game analyst for their Sunday MLB Games and MLB postseason coverage on TBS. He retired from NESN in 2022.

==Early life==
Eckersley grew up in Fremont, California, rooting for both the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). Two of his boyhood heroes were the Giants&#x27; Willie Mays and Juan Marichal, and he later adopted Marichal&#x27;s high leg kick pitching delivery.

Eckersley attended Washington High School in Fremont. He played for the football team as a quarterback until his senior year, when he gave up football to protect his throwing arm from injury. He won 29 games as a pitcher at Washington, throwing a fastball and a screwball.

==Baseball career==

===Cleveland Indians (1975–1977)===
The Cleveland Indians selected Eckersley in the third round of the 1972 MLB draft; he was disappointed that he was not drafted by the Giants. He made his major league debut on April 12, 1975. He was the &quot;The Sporting News&quot; American League Rookie Pitcher of the Year in 1975, compiling a 13–7 win–loss record and 2.60 earned run average (ERA). His unstyled long hair, moustache, and live fastball made him an instant and identifiable fan favorite. Eckersley pitched reliably over three seasons with the Indians.
On May 30, 1977, Eckersley threw a no-hitter against the California Angels at Cleveland Stadium. He struck out 12 batters and only allowed two to reach base, Tony Solaita on a walk in the first inning and Bobby Bonds on a third strike that was a wild pitch. He earned his first All-Star Game selection that year and finished the season with a 14–13 win–loss record.

===Boston Red Sox (1978–1984)===
The Indians traded Eckersley and Fred Kendall to the Boston Red Sox for Rick Wise, Mike Paxton, Bo Díaz, and Ted Cox on March 30, 1978. Over the next two seasons, Eckersley won a career-high 20 games in 1978 and 17 games in 1979, with a 2.99 ERA in each year. However, during the remainder of his tenure with Boston, from 1980 to 1984, Eckersley pitched poorly. His fastball had lost some steam, as demonstrated by his 43–48 record with Boston. He later developed a very effective slider.

===Chicago Cubs (1984–1986)===
On May 25, 1984, the Red Sox traded Eckersley with Mike Brumley to the Chicago Cubs for Bill Buckner, one of several mid-season deals that helped the Cubs to their first postseason appearance since 1945. He won 10 games and lost 8, with a 3.03 ERA.

Eckersley remained with the Cubs in 1985, when he posted an 11–7 won-lost record with two shutouts (the last two of his career). Eckersley&#x27;s performance deteriorated in 1986, when he posted a 6–11 record with a 4.57 ERA. After the season, he checked himself into a rehabilitation clinic to treat alcoholism. Eckersley noted in Pluto&#x27;s book that he realized the problem he had after family members videotaped him while drunk and played the tape back for him the next day. During his Hall of Fame speech he recalled that time in his life, saying &quot;I was spiraling out of control personally. I knew I had come to a crossroads in my life. With the grace of God, I got sober and I saved my life.&quot;

===Oakland Athletics (1987–1995)===
Eckersley was traded again on April 3, , to the Oakland Athletics, where manager Tony La Russa intended to use him as a set-up pitcher or long reliever. Indeed, Eckersley started two games with the A&#x27;s before an injury to then-closer Jay Howell opened the door for Eckersley to move into the closer&#x27;s role. He saved 16 games in 1987 and then established himself as a dominant closer in 1988 by recording a league-leading 45 saves. Eckersley recorded 4 saves against the Red Sox in the regular season, and he dominated once more by recording saves in all four games as the A&#x27;s swept the Red Sox in the 1988 ALCS. (which was matched by Greg Holland in the 2014 ALCS), but he found himself on the wrong end of Kirk Gibson&#x27;s 1988 World Series home run (Eckersley himself first coined the phrase &quot;walk-off home run&quot; to describe that moment) as the A&#x27;s lost to the Dodgers in 5 games.

In the 1989 World Series he secured the victory in Game Two, and then earned the save in the final game of the Series, as the A&#x27;s swept the San Francisco Giants in four games.

Eckersley was the most dominant closer in the game from 1988 to , finishing first in the A.L. in saves twice, second two other times, and third once. He saved 220 games during the five years and never posted an ERA higher than 2.96. He gave up five earned runs in the entire season, resulting in a 0.61 ERA. Eckersley&#x27;s control, which had always been above average even when he was not otherwise pitching well, became his trademark; he walked only three batters in 57.2 innings in , four batters in 73.1 innings in 1990, and nine batters in 76 innings in 1991. Between August 7, 1989, and June 10, 1990, Eckersley appeared in 41 games without walking a single batter, setting a record which still stands and surpassing the previous mark set by Lew Burdette 23 years earlier. In his 1990 season, Eckersley became the first relief pitcher in baseball history to have more saves than baserunners allowed (48 saves, 41 hits, 4 walks, 0 hit by pitch). Perhaps interestingly, rounded to three decimal places, he had the same walks plus hits per innings pitched and ERA: both were 0.614.

Eckersley was the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Award winner in 1992, a season in which he posted 51 saves. Only two relievers had previously accomplished the double feat: Rollie Fingers in and Willie Hernández in . In the 1992 American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays, during Game 4 in what some considered the turning point in the series that the Jays won, Eckersley gave up a game-tying 2-run home run to Roberto Alomar and his team eventually lost 7–6 in 11 innings.

Eckersley&#x27;s numbers slipped following 1992: although he still was among the league leaders in saves, his ERA climbed sharply, and his number of saves never climbed above 36.

On September 16, 1993, in a game against the Minnesota Twins, Eckersley allowed Dave Winfield&#x27;s 3,000th career hit.

After the 1994 season, the Athletics elected not to exercise a $4 million option on Eckersley, making him a free agent. The team indicated that it would be interested in signing him at a lower salary. Oakland signed him to a one-year contract in early April 1995. His contract was the first major league deal after a three-month signing ban resulting from a labor dispute between owners and the players union.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1996–1997)===
When La Russa left the Athletics after the 1995 season to become the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; new manager, he arranged to bring Eckersley along with him. Eckersley continued in his role as closer and remained one of the league&#x27;s best, with 66 saves in two seasons in St. Louis.

===Return to Red Sox (1998)===
Following the 1997 season, he signed with the Red Sox for a final season, serving as a set-up man for Tom Gordon, as Boston qualified for the AL playoffs.

Eckersley announced his retirement in December 1998. He commented on his career, saying, &quot;I had a good run. I had some magic that was with me for a long time, so I know that I was real lucky to not have my arm fall off for one thing, and to make it this long physically is tough enough. But to me it&#x27;s like you&#x27;re being rescued too when your career&#x27;s over. It&#x27;s like, &#x27;Whew, the pressure&#x27;s off&#x27;.&quot;

===Career statistics===

He retired with a career 197–171 win–loss record, a 3.50 ERA and 390 saves. As of the end of the 2023 season, Eckersley&#x27;s career saves total ranks ninth on the all-time saves list. When he retired, Eckersley had appeared in more games (1,071) than any other pitcher in major league history, though he ranks fifth all-time through the 2023 season.

==Pitching style==
Eckersley&#x27;s unusual delivery utilized a high leg kick along with a long, pronounced sidearm throwing motion. He had pinpoint accuracy, and fellow Hall of Famer Goose Gossage said of him, &quot;He could hit a gnat in the butt with a pitch if he wanted to.” Eckersley was aggressive and animated on the mound, and he was known for his intimidating stare and pumping his fist after a strikeout. As a starter, Eckersley was able to throw four pitches for strikes, but as a reliever he narrowed his repertoire to two pitches; a sinker and a backdoor slider.

==Post-playing career==

In 1999, he ranked Number 98 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. On January 6, 2004, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, with 83.2% of the votes. On August 13, 2005, Eckersley&#x27;s uniform number (43) was officially retired by the Oakland Athletics. The baseball field at his alma mater, Washington High School, has been named in his honor.

In 2017, Eckersley rejoined the Athletics as the special assistant to Dave Kaval, the team&#x27;s president.

===Broadcasting===
Eckersley began working as a studio analyst and color commentator for the Boston Red Sox on NESN in 2002. &quot;Eck&quot; became known for his easy-going manner and his own baseball vernacular, with Red Sox Nation attempting to keep up via &quot;The Ecktionary,&quot; a defining list of his on-air sayings.

In the spring of 2009, when regular NESN commentator Jerry Remy took time off for health reasons, Eckersley filled in for him, providing color commentary alongside play-by-play announcer Don Orsillo. Eckersley was the primary substitute for Remy when he was unavailable, including filling in for the final two months of the 2013 season, when Remy took extended time off due to the murder indictment of his son, Jared. Eckersley continued to work with Orsillo&#x27;s successor, Dave O&#x27;Brien, for various Red Sox games, and often worked with Remy and O&#x27;Brien in a three-man booth prior to Remy&#x27;s death in 2021.

Eckersley also worked with TBS as a studio analyst from 2008 to 2012. In 2013, Eckersley moved to the booth with TBS, calling Sunday games for the network and also providing postseason analysis from the booth. In the 2017 postseason, he worked with Brian Anderson, Joe Simpson and Lauren Shehadi.

Eckersley announced his retirement from NESN on August 8, 2022. In a statement released by NESN, he said:

After 50 years in Major League Baseball, I am excited about this next chapter of my life. I will continue to be an ambassador for the club and a proud member of Red Sox Nation while transitioning to life after baseball alongside my wife Jennifer, my children and my grandchildren. I’m forever grateful to NESN, the Red Sox, my family and the fans for supporting me throughout my career and through this decision and I look forward to remaining engaged with the team in a variety of capacities for years to come.

During an interview with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Eckersley said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been thinking about this for a long time. Not that it matters, but it&#x27;s kind of a round number, leaving. I started in pro ball in &#x27;72, when I was a 17-year-old kid right out of high school. Fifty years ago ... So it&#x27;s time.&quot; Following his announcement, Sean McGrail, NESN president and CEO said that NESN was &quot;...fortunate that Dennis has been a part of our Red Sox coverage ... His unbridled passion, nuanced insights and Eck humor will be dearly missed and we are thankful for his many contributions to NESN. We wish him the best as he embarks on this next chapter of his life as a grandfather, father, husband and member of Red Sox Nation.&quot; Eckersley&#x27;s final Red Sox broadcast as a NESN commentator was October 5, 2022.

==Personal life==
Eckersley married his first wife Denise in 1973 and they had a daughter, Mandee Eckersley. Denise left him for Rick Manning, his then–Cleveland Indians teammate, in 1978; the affair precipitated Eckersley&#x27;s trade to the Red Sox that year. Two years later, Eckersley married model Nancy O&#x27;Neil. They adopted two children together, a son Jake and a daughter Alexandra. They divorced shortly after his retirement from baseball. His third wife, Jennifer, is a former lobbyist and manages Eckersley&#x27;s business and charitable affairs.

During the first half of his career, Eckersley had problems with alcohol; he became sober in January 1987.

An MLB Network documentary about Eckersley, titled &quot;Eck: A Story of Saving&quot;, premiered on December 13, 2018.

In December 2022, Eckersley&#x27;s adopted daughter Alexandra, a homeless person, was arrested on suspicion of abandoning her newborn in a wooded area in 18 degree weather and misleading authorities as to the infant&#x27;s whereabouts. Alexandra had been homeless since 2018 and suffering from addiction and mental health issues.

<doc id="392547" wikidata="Q214199" url="?curid=392547" title="Fuel oil">
<text>Fuel oil is any of various fractions obtained from the distillation of petroleum (crude oil). Such oils include distillates (the lighter fractions) and residues (the heavier fractions). Fuel oils include heavy fuel oil (bunker fuel), marine fuel oil (MFO), furnace oil (FO), gas oil (gasoil), heating oils (such as home heating oil), diesel fuel, and others. 

The term &quot;fuel oil&quot; generally includes any liquid fuel that is burned in a furnace or boiler to generate heat (heating oils), or used in an engine to generate power (as motor fuels). However, it does not usually include other liquid oils, such as those with a flash point of approximately , or oils burned in cotton- or wool-wick burners. In a stricter sense, &quot;fuel oil&quot; refers only to the heaviest commercial fuels that crude oil can yield, that is, those fuels heavier than gasoline (petrol) and naphtha.

Fuel oil consists of long-chain hydrocarbons, particularly alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics. Small molecules, such as those in propane, naphtha, gasoline, and kerosene, have relatively low boiling points, and are removed at the start of the fractional distillation process. Heavier petroleum-derived oils like diesel fuel and lubricating oil are much less volatile and distill out more slowly.

==Uses==
 Oil has many uses; it heats homes and businesses and fuels trucks, ships, and some cars. A small amount of electricity is produced by diesel, but it is more polluting and more expensive than natural gas. It is often used as a backup fuel for peaking power plants in case the supply of natural gas is interrupted or as the main fuel for small electrical generators. In Europe, the use of diesel is generally restricted to cars (about 40%), SUVs (about 90%), and trucks and buses (over 99%). The market for home heating using fuel oil has decreased due to the widespread penetration of natural gas as well as heat pumps. However, it is very common in some areas, such as the Northeastern United States.

Residual fuel oil is less useful because it is so viscous that it has to be heated with a special heating system before use and it may contain relatively high amounts of pollutants, particularly sulfur, which forms sulfur dioxide upon combustion. However, its undesirable properties make it very cheap. In fact, it is the cheapest liquid fuel available. Since it requires heating before use, residual fuel oil cannot be used in road vehicles, boats or small ships, as the heating equipment takes up valuable space and makes the vehicle heavier. Heating the oil is also a delicate procedure, which is impractical on small, fast moving vehicles. However, power plants and large ships are able to use residual fuel oil.

Use of residual fuel oil was more common in the past. It powered boilers, railroad steam locomotives, and steamships. Locomotives, however, have become powered by diesel or electric power; steamships are not as common as they were previously due to their higher operating costs (most LNG carriers use steam plants, as &quot;boil-off&quot; gas emitted from the cargo can be used as a fuel source); and most boilers now use heating oil or natural gas. Some industrial boilers still use it and so do some old buildings, including in New York City. In 2011 New York City estimated that the 1% of its buildings that burned fuel oils No. 4 and No. 6 were responsible for 86% of the soot pollution generated by all buildings in the city. New York made the phase out of these fuel grades part of its environmental plan, PlaNYC, because of concerns for the health effects caused by fine particulates, and all buildings using fuel oil No. 6 had been converted to less polluting fuel by the end of 2015.

Residual fuel&#x27;s use in electrical generation has also decreased. In 1973, residual fuel oil produced 16.8% of the electricity in the US. By 1983, it had fallen to 6.2%, and , electricity production from all forms of petroleum, including diesel and residual fuel, is only 3% of total production. The decline is the result of price competition with natural gas and environmental restrictions on emissions. For power plants, the costs of heating the oil, extra pollution control and additional maintenance required after burning it often outweigh the low cost of the fuel. Burning fuel oil, particularly residual fuel oil, produces uniformly higher carbon dioxide emissions than natural gas.

Heavy fuel oils continue to be used in the boiler &quot;lighting up&quot; facility in many coal-fired power plants. This use is approximately analogous to using kindling to start a fire. Without performing this act it is difficult to begin the large-scale combustion process.

The chief drawback to residual fuel oil is its high initial viscosity, particularly in the case of No. 6 oil, which requires a correctly engineered system for storage, pumping, and burning. Though it is still usually lighter than water (with a specific gravity usually ranging from 0.95 to 1.03) it is much heavier and more viscous than No. 2 oil, kerosene, or gasoline. No. 6 oil must, in fact, be stored at around heated to before it can be easily pumped, and in cooler temperatures it can congeal into a tarry semisolid. The flash point of most blends of No. 6 oil is, incidentally, about . Attempting to pump high-viscosity oil at low temperatures was a frequent cause of damage to fuel lines, furnaces, and related equipment which were often designed for lighter fuels.

For comparison, BS 2869 Class G heavy fuel oil behaves in similar fashion, requiring storage at , pumping at around and finalizing for burning at around .

Most of the facilities which historically burned No. 6 or other residual oils were industrial plants and similar facilities constructed in the early or mid 20th century, or which had switched from coal to oil fuel during the same time period. In either case, residual oil was seen as a good prospect because it was cheap and readily available. Most of these facilities have subsequently been closed and demolished, or have replaced their fuel supplies with a simpler one such as gas or No. 2 oil. The high sulfur content of No. 6 oil—up to 3% by weight in some extreme cases—had a corrosive effect on many heating systems (which were usually designed without adequate corrosion protection in mind), shortening their lifespans and increasing the polluting effects. This was particularly the case in furnaces that were regularly shut down and allowed to go cold, because the internal condensation produced sulfuric acid.

Environmental cleanups at such facilities are frequently complicated by the use of asbestos insulation on the fuel feed lines. No. 6 oil is very persistent, and does not degrade rapidly. Its viscosity and stickiness also make remediation of underground contamination very difficult, since these properties reduce the effectiveness of methods such as air stripping.

When released into water, such as a river or ocean, residual oil tends to break up into patches or tarballs – mixtures of oil and particulate matter such as silt and floating organic matter – rather than form a single slick. An average of about 5-10% of the material will evaporate within hours of the release, primarily the lighter hydrocarbon fractions. The remainder will then often sink to the bottom of the water column.

== Health effects ==
Because of the low quality of bunker fuel, when burnt it is especially harmful to the health of humans, causing serious illnesses and deaths. Prior to the IMO&#x27;s 2020 sulfur cap, shipping industry air pollution was estimated to cause around 400,000 premature deaths each year, from lung cancer and cardiovascular disease, as well as 14 million childhood asthma cases each year.

Even after the introduction of cleaner fuel rules in 2020, shipping air pollution is still estimated to account for around 250,000 deaths each year, and around 6.4 million childhood asthma cases each year.

The hardest hit countries by air pollution from ships are China, Japan, the UK, Indonesia, and Germany. In 2015, shipping air pollution killed an estimated 20,520 people in China, 4,019 people in Japan, and 3,192 people in the UK.

According to an ICCT study, countries located on major shipping lanes are particularly exposed, and can see shipping account for a high percentage of overall deaths from transport sector air pollution. In Taiwan, shipping accounts for 70% of all transport-attributable air pollution deaths in 2015, followed by Morocco at 51%, Malaysia and Japan both at 41%, Vietnam at 39%, and the UK at 38%.

As well as commercial shipping, cruise ships also emit large amounts of air pollution, damaging people&#x27;s health. Up to 2019, it was reported that the ships of the single largest cruise company, Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, emitted ten times more sulfur dioxide than all of Europe&#x27;s cars combined.

==General classification==
===United States===

Although the following trends generally hold true, different organizations may have different numerical specifications for the six fuel grades. The boiling point and carbon chain length of the fuel increases with fuel oil number. Viscosity also increases with number, and the heaviest oil must be heated for it to flow. Price usually decreases as the fuel number increases.

Number 1 fuel oil is a volatile distillate oil intended for vaporizing pot-type burners and high-performance/clean diesel engines. It is the kerosene refinery cut that boils off immediately after the heavy naphtha cut used for gasoline. This fuel is commonly known as diesel no. 1, kerosene, and jet fuel. Former names include: coal oil, stove oil, and range oil.

Number 2 fuel oil is a distillate home heating oil. Trucks and some cars use similar diesel no. 2 with a cetane number limit describing the ignition quality of the fuel. Both are typically obtained from the light gas oil cut. The name &quot;gasoil&quot; refers to the original use of this fraction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries—the gas oil cut was used as an enriching agent for carbureted water gas manufacture.

Number 3 fuel oil was a distillate oil for burners requiring low-viscosity fuel. ASTM merged this grade into the number 2 specification, and the term has been rarely used since the mid-20th century.

Number 4 fuel oil is a commercial heating oil for burner installations not equipped with preheaters. It may be obtained from the heavy gas oil cut. This fuel is sometimes known by the Navy specification of Bunker A.

Number 5 fuel oil is a residual-type industrial heating oil requiring preheating to for proper atomization at the burners. It may be obtained from the heavy gas oil cut, or it may be a blend of residual oil with enough number 2 oil to adjust viscosity until it can be pumped without preheating. This fuel is sometimes known by the Navy specification of Bunker B.

Number 6 fuel oil is a high-viscosity residual oil requiring preheating to . Residual means the material remaining after the more valuable cuts of crude oil have boiled off. The residue may contain various undesirable impurities, including 2% water and 0.5% mineral oil. This fuel may be known as residual fuel oil (RFO), by the Navy specification of Bunker C, or by the Pacific Specification of PS-400.

===United Kingdom===
The British Standard BS 2869, &quot;Fuel Oils for Agricultural, Domestic and Industrial Engines&quot;, specifies the following fuel oil classes:
Class C1 and C2 fuels are kerosene-type fuels. C1 is for use in flueless appliances (e.g. lamps). C2 is for vaporizing or atomizing burners in appliances connected to flues.

Class A2 fuel is suitable for mobile, off-road applications that are required to use a sulfur-free fuel. Class D fuel is similar to Class A2 and is suitable for use in stationary applications, such as domestic, commercial, and industrial heating. The BS 2869 standard permits Class A2 and Class D fuel to contain up to 7% (V/V) biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester, FAME), provided the FAME content meets the requirements of the BS EN 14214 standard.

Classes E to H are residual oils for atomizing burners serving boilers or, with the exception of Class H, certain types of larger combustion engines. Classes F to H invariably require heating prior to use; Class E fuel may require preheating, depending on ambient conditions.

===Russia===

Mazut is a residual fuel oil often derived from Russian petroleum sources and is either blended with lighter petroleum fractions or burned directly in specialized boilers and furnaces. It is also used as a petrochemical feedstock. In the Russian practice, though, &quot;mazut&quot; is an umbrella term roughly synonymous with the fuel oil in general, that covers most of the types mentioned above, except US grades 1 and 2/3, for which separate terms exist (kerosene and diesel fuel/solar oil respectively — Russian practice doesn&#x27;t differentiate between diesel fuel and heating oil). This is further separated in two grades, &quot;naval mazut&quot; being analogous to US grades 4 and 5, and &quot;furnace mazut&quot;, a heaviest residual fraction of the crude, almost exactly corresponding to US Number 6 fuel oil and further graded by viscosity and sulfur content.

==Maritime fuel classification==
In the maritime field another type of classification is used for fuel oils:
*MGO (Marine gas oil) - Roughly equivalent to no. 2 fuel oil, made from distillate only
*MDO (Marine diesel oil) - Roughly equivalent to no. 3 fuel oil, a blend of heavy gasoil that may contain very small amounts of black refinery feed stocks, but has a low viscosity up to 12 cSt so it need not be heated for use in internal combustion engines
*IFO (Intermediate fuel oil) - Roughly equivalent no. 4 fuel oil, a blend of gasoil and heavy fuel oil, with less gasoil than marine diesel oil
*HFO (Heavy fuel oil) - Pure or nearly pure residual oil, roughly equivalent to no. 5 and no. 6 fuel oil
*NSFO (Navy special fuel oil) - Another name for no. 5 HFO
*MFO (Marine fuel oil) - Another name for no. 6 HFO

Marine diesel oil contains some heavy fuel oil, unlike regular diesels.

===Standards and classification===
CCAI and CII are two indexes which describe the ignition quality of residual fuel oil, and CCAI is especially often calculated for marine fuels. Despite this, marine fuels are still quoted on the international bunker markets with their maximum viscosity (which is set by the ISO 8217 standard - see below) due to the fact that marine engines are designed to use different viscosities of fuel. The unit of viscosity used is the centistoke (cSt) and the fuels most frequently quoted are listed below in order of cost, the least expensive first.
*IFO 380 - Intermediate fuel oil with a maximum viscosity of 380 centistokes (&lt;3.5% sulfur)
*IFO 180 - Intermediate fuel oil with a maximum viscosity of 180 centistokes (&lt;3.5% sulfur)
*LS 380 - Low-sulfur (&lt;1.0%) intermediate fuel oil with a maximum viscosity of 380 centistokes
*LS 180 - Low-sulfur (&lt;1.0%) intermediate fuel oil with a maximum viscosity of 180 centistokes
*MDO - Marine diesel oil
*MGO - Marine gasoil
*LSMGO - Low-sulfur (&lt;0.1%) Marine Gas Oil - The fuel is to be used in EU Ports and Anchorages. EU Sulfur directive 2005/33/EC
*ULSMGO - Ultra-Low-Sulfur Marine Gas Oil - referred to as Ultra-Low-Sulfur Diesel (sulfur 0.0015% max) in the US and Auto Gas Oil (sulfur 0.001% max) in the EU. Maximum sulfur allowable in US territories and territorial waters (inland, marine, and automotive) and in the EU for inland use.

The density is also an important parameter for fuel oils since marine fuels are purified before use to remove water and dirt from the oil. Since the purifiers use centrifugal force, the oil must have a density which is sufficiently different from water. Older purifiers work with a fuel having a maximum of 991 kg/m3; with modern purifiers it is also possible to purify oil with a density of 1010 kg/m3.

The first British standard for fuel oil came in 1982. The latest standard is ISO 8217 issued in 2017. The ISO standard describe four qualities of distillate fuels and 10 qualities of residual fuels. Over the years the standards have become stricter on environmentally important parameters such as sulfur content. The latest standard also banned the adding of used lubricating oil (ULO).

Some parameters of marine fuel oils according to ISO 8217 (3. ed 2005):


# Maximum sulfur content in the open ocean is 0.5% since January 2020. Maximum sulfur content in designated areas is 0.1% since 1 January 2015. Before then it was 1.00%.
# The content of aluminum and silicon is limited because those metals are dangerous for the engine. Those elements are present because some components of the fuel are manufactured with Fluid Catalytic Cracking process, which makes use of catalyst containing aluminum and silicon.
# The flash point of all fuels used in the engine room should be at least 60 °C. (DMX is used for things like emergency generators and not normally used in the engine room. Gaseous fuels such as LPG/LNG have special class rules applied to the fuel systems.)

===Bunker fuel===

Bunker fuel or bunker crude is technically any type of fuel oil used aboard water vessels. Its name is derived from coal bunkers, where the fuel was originally stored. In 2019, large ships consumed 213 million metric tons of bunker fuel. The Australian Customs and the Australian Tax Office defines a bunker fuel as the fuel that powers the engine of a ship or aircraft. Bunker A is No. 4 fuel oil, bunker B is No. 5, and bunker C is No. 6. Since No. 6 is the most common, &quot;bunker fuel&quot; is often used as a synonym for No. 6. No. 5 fuel oil is also called Navy Special Fuel Oil (NSFO) or just navy special; No. 5 or 6 are also commonly called heavy fuel oil (HFO) or furnace fuel oil (FFO); the high viscosity requires heating, usually by a recirculated low pressure steam system, before the oil can be pumped from a bunker tank. Bunkers are rarely labeled this way in modern maritime practice.

Since the 1980s the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has been the accepted standard for marine fuels (bunkers). The standard is listed under number 8217, with recent updates in 2010 and 2017. The latest edition of bunker fuel specification is ISO 8217: 2017. The standard divides fuels into residual and distillate fuels. The most common residual fuels in the shipping industry are RMG and RMK. The differences between the two are mainly the density and viscosity, with RMG generally being delivered at 380 centistokes or less, and RMK at 700 centistokes or less. Ships with more advanced engines can process heavier, more viscous, and thus cheaper, fuel. Governing bodies around the world, &quot;e.g.&quot;, California, European Union, have established Emission Control Areas (ECA) that limit the maximum sulfur of fuels burned in their ports to limit pollution, reducing the percentage of sulfur and other particulates from 4.5% m/m to as little as 0.10% as of 2015 inside an ECA. As of 2013 3.5% continued to be permitted outside an ECA, but the International Maritime Organization has planned to lower the sulfur content requirement outside the ECAs to 0.5% m/m by 2020. This is where Marine Distillate Fuels and other alternatives to use of heavy bunker fuel come into play. They have similar properties to diesel #2, which is used as road diesel around the world. The most common grades used in shipping are DMA and DMB. Greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the use of international bunker fuels are currently included in national inventories.

Heavy fuel oil is still the primary fuel for cruise ships, a tourism sector that is associated with a clean and friendly image. In stark contrast, the exhaust gas emissions - due to HFO&#x27;s high sulfur content - result in an eco balance significantly worse than that for individual mobility.
==Bunkering==
The term &quot;bunkering&quot; broadly relates to storage of petroleum products in tanks (among other, disparate meanings). The precise meaning can be further specialized depending on context. Perhaps the most common, more specialized usage refers to the practice and business of refueling ships. Bunkering operations are located at seaports, and they include the storage of bunker (ship) fuels and the provision of the fuel to vessels.

Alternatively &quot;bunkering&quot; may apply to the shipboard logistics of loading fuel and distributing it among available bunkers (on-board fuel tanks).

Finally, in the context of the oil industry in Nigeria, bunkering has come to refer to the illegal diversion of crude oil (often subsequently refined in makeshift facilities into lighter transportation fuels) by the unauthorized cutting of holes into transport pipelines, often by very crude and hazardous means and causing spills.

As of 2018, some 300 million metric tons of fuel oil is used for ship bunkering. On January 1, 2020, regulations set by the International Marine Organization (IMO) all marine shipping vessels will require the use of very low sulfur fuel oil (0.5% Sulfur) or to install exhaust gas scrubber systems to remove the excess sulfur dioxide. The emissions from ships have generally been controlled by the following sulfur caps on any fuel oil used on board: 3.50% on and after 1 January 2012 and 0.50% on and after 1 January 2020.
Further removal of sulfur translates to additional energy and capital costs and can impact fuel price and availability. If priced correctly the excess cheap yet dirty fuel would find its way into other markets, including displacing some onshore energy production in nations with low environmental protection .

==Transportation==
Fuel oil is transported worldwide by fleets of oil tankers making deliveries to suitably sized strategic ports such as Houston, US; Singapore; Fujairah, United Arab Emirates; Balboa, Panama, Cristobal, Panama; Sakha, Egypt; Algeciras, Spain and Rotterdam, Netherlands. Where a convenient seaport does not exist, inland transport may be achieved with the use of barges. Lighter fuel oils can also be transported through pipelines. The major physical supply chains of Europe are along the Rhine River.

==Environmental issues==

Emissions from bunker fuel burning in ships contribute to climate change and to air pollution levels in many port cities, especially where the emissions from industry and road traffic have been controlled. The switch of auxiliary engines from heavy fuel oil to diesel oil at berth can result in large emission reductions, especially for SO2 and PM. CO2 emissions from bunker fuels sold are not added to national GHG emissions. For small countries with large international ports, there is an important difference between the emissions in territorial waters and the total emissions of the fuel sold. At the 1997 Third Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, countries agreed to exempt bunker fuels, and multilateral military operations, from national emissions totals after insistence from the U.S. climate change delegation for such exemptions.

<text>Aston Sandford is a small village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, about east of Haddenham and northwest of Princes Risborough. It is in the civil parish of Kingsey within the Buckinghamshire Council unitary authority area.

The &quot;Aston&quot; part of the toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;Eastern Estate&quot;. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the village was known as Cold Aston, and both it and Haddenham were owned by the same manor, suggesting that Aston got its name from being the farming estate to the east of Haddenham. The owner of both places in 1086 was listed as Manno the Breton.

By 1199 the estate had been annexed by the Norman rulers and was placed into the extensive estates belonging to the heirs of Odo, Bishop of Bayeux: the Sandfords. It was from this time that the village became known as Aston Sandford.

The Church of England parish church of Saint Michael and All Angels is one of the smallest in England. The nave is probably 12th century and the chancel is probably 13th century. The chancel arch is also 13th century. The northeast window and blocked north doorway are probably 14th century and a buttress on the west wall is probably 15th century. However, the building was so extensively restored and reworked in 1878 that it is difficult to date any of its features with certainty.

The parish&#x27;s rector from 1803 to 1821 was the biblical commentator Revd. Thomas Scott, who trained the first missionaries of the Church Missionary Society here.

<text>Terry Lynn Nichols (born April 1, 1955) is an American domestic terrorist who was convicted for conspiring with Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing plot. Prior to his incarceration, he held a variety of short-term jobs, working as a farmer, grain elevator manager, real estate salesman, and ranch hand. He met Timothy McVeigh during a brief stint in the U.S. Army, which ended in 1989 when he requested a hardship discharge after less than one year of service. In 1994 and 1995, he conspired with McVeigh in the planning and preparation of the truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995. The bombing killed 168 people.

In a federal trial in 1997, Nichols was convicted of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and eight counts of involuntary manslaughter for killing federal law enforcement personnel. He was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole after the jury deadlocked on the death penalty. He was also tried in Oklahoma on state charges of murder in connection with the bombing. In 2004, he was convicted of 161 counts of first degree murder, including one count of fetal homicide, first-degree arson, and conspiracy. As in the federal trial, the state jury deadlocked on imposing the death penalty. In the longest prison sentence ever given to an individual, he was sentenced to 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole, and is incarcerated at ADX Florence, a super maximum security prison near Florence, Colorado. He shared a cell block that is commonly referred to as &quot;Bomber&#x27;s Row&quot; with Ramzi Yousef and Eric Rudolph, as well as Ted Kaczynski until his transfer in 2021.

== Early life==
Nichols was born in Lapeer, Michigan. He was raised on a farm, the third of four children of Joyce and Robert Nichols. Growing up, he helped his parents on the farm, learning to operate and maintain the equipment. According to the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, he also cared for injured birds and animals.

== Adulthood ==
Nichols attended Lapeer High School where he took elective classes in crafts and business law. Throughout school, friends characterized him as shy. While in high school he played junior varsity football, wrestled, and was a member of the ski club. His brother James, who self-published a 400-page book about the bombing, has stated that Terry was book smart and good at artwork. He graduated from high school in 1973 with a 3.6 grade point average, with ambitions of becoming a physician.

Nichols enrolled at Central Michigan University. He completed one term of 13 credit hours with B grade average. He had Cs in biology, chemistry and trigonometry, a B in literature and an A in archery. In 1974, after another brother, Leslie, was badly burned in a fuel tank explosion on the farm, he offered to give him skin for grafts. He tried farming with his brother James for a while, but they did not get along; he felt his brother was too bossy. Later he moved to Colorado and obtained a license to sell real estate in 1976. Soon after he closed on his first big sale, his mother told him she needed his help on the farm, so he returned to Michigan.

In 1980, Nichols met real estate agent Lana Walsh, a twice-divorced mother of two who was five years his senior. They married and had a son in 1982. During the marriage, Nichols engaged in a succession of part-time and short-term jobs: carpentry work, managing a grain elevator, and selling life insurance and real estate. According to Lana, she was the one with a career; Nichols was a house husband, who spent most of his time at home with the children cooking and gardening.

Nichols had never liked farm life, and in 1988, at the age of 33, he tried to escape it by enlisting in the United States Army. He was sent to Fort Benning next to Columbus, Georgia for basic training. As the oldest man in his platoon, he had difficulty with the physical aspect of the training, and was sometimes called &quot;grandpa&quot; by the other men. However, he was soon made the platoon guide because of his age. Timothy McVeigh was in his platoon, and they quickly became close friends. They had a common background: both men grew up in white rural areas. Both had tried college for a while and had parents who were divorced. They shared political views and interests in gun collecting and the survivalist movement. The two were later stationed together at Fort Riley in Junction City, Kansas, where they met and became friends with their future accomplice, Michael Fortier.

Nichols&#x27;s wife filed for divorce soon after he joined the Army. Due to a conflict over childcare, he requested and was given a hardship discharge in May 1989 to return home to take care of his son, who was seven years old at the time. As he departed, he told a fellow soldier that he would be starting his own military organization soon, and would have an unlimited supply of weapons.

In 1990, Nichols, 35, married 17-year-old Marife Torres from the Philippines, whom he met through a mail-order bride agency. When she arrived in Michigan several months later, she was pregnant with another man&#x27;s child. The child died at age two when he suffocated after getting tangled up with a plastic bag from a banana box that was left overnight in his bedroom. Marife initially suspected foul play from either Nichols or McVeigh, but there were no bruises or signs of trauma to the child. The death was ruled accidental. Nichols and Marife had two more children during their marriage. Nichols and Torres frequently visited the Philippines, where she was attending a local college working on a degree in physical therapy. He sometimes traveled to the Philippines alone, while she remained in Kansas.

Nichols left a cryptic note and a package of documents with his ex-wife, Lana (Walsh) Padilla, prior to one of his many visits to the Philippines. Upon returning from the visit to learn that she had prematurely opened a letter instructing her what to do in the event of his death, he made a series of telephone calls to a Cebu City boarding house. 
Nichols and Torres divorced after his arrest. Marife returned to the Philippines with the children.

==Anti-government views==
Nichols&#x27; anti-government views developed and grew over the years. Nichols spent most of his adult life in the Lapeer and Sanilac County areas of Michigan where mistrust and resentment of the federal government was common, especially after bank foreclosures of many farms during the 1980s farm crisis. Neighbors said he attended meetings of anti-government groups, experimented with explosives and got more radical as time went on. 

Nichols began to adhere to sovereign citizen ideology. In February 1992, he attempted to renounce his US citizenship by writing to the local county clerk in Michigan, stating that the political system was corrupt, and declaring himself a &quot;non resident alien&quot;. Several months later, he appeared in court and tried to avoid responsibility for some of his credit card bills (he owed approximately $40,000 altogether), refusing to come before the bench, and shouting at the judge that the government had no jurisdiction over him. On October 19, 1992, he signed another document renouncing his US citizenship. In May 1993, Nichols appeared before a county judge regarding an $8,421 unpaid credit card debt. He also renounced his driver’s license.

McVeigh and Nichols grew closer after McVeigh&#x27;s discharge from the Army. In December 1991, Nichols invited McVeigh to join him in Michigan and help him out selling military surplus at gun shows. For the next three years, McVeigh stayed with Nichols off and on. On April 19, 1993, Nichols was watching TV with McVeigh at the Nichols&#x27; farmhouse in Michigan during the siege of the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. When the compound went up in flames, McVeigh and Nichols were enraged and began to plot revenge on the federal government. In the fall of 1993, Nichols and McVeigh, who were living at the farm, became business partners, selling weapons and military surplus at gun shows. For a while, they lived an itinerant life, following the gun shows from town to town.

Nichols then went to Las Vegas to try working in construction but failed. Next, he went to central Kansas and was hired in March 1994 as a ranch hand in Marion, Kansas. In March 1994, he sent a letter to the clerk of Marion County, Kansas, saying he was not subject to the laws of the U.S. government and asked his employer not to withhold any federal taxes from his check. His employer said Nichols was hard-working but had unusual political views. In the fall of 1994, Nichols quit his job, telling his employer he was going into business with McVeigh.

==The bombing==
On September 22, 1994, Nichols and McVeigh rented a storage shed and began gathering supplies for the truck bomb. In late September or early October, Nichols and McVeigh stole dynamite and blasting caps from a nearby quarry. Nichols began purchasing large quantities of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and storing it in three rental storage units. Nichols also robbed an Arkansas gun dealer who had befriended him and McVeigh at various gun shows.

In February 1995 Nichols bought a small house in Herington, Kansas, with a cash down payment. In March 1995, he bought diesel fuel. On April 14, Nichols gave McVeigh some cash, according to McVeigh. On April 16, Easter Sunday, Nichols and McVeigh drove to Oklahoma City to drop off the getaway car. On April 18, the day before the bombing, Nichols helped McVeigh prepare the truck bomb at a lake near Herington. McVeigh remarked about Nichols&#x27;s and Fortier&#x27;s partial withdrawal from the plot, saying they &quot;were men who liked to talk tough, but in the end their bitches and kids ruled.&quot; Nichols was at home in Kansas with his family when the bomb went off.

On April 21, 1995, Nichols learned he was wanted for questioning, turned himself in, and consented to a search of his home. The search turned up blasting caps, detonating cords, ground ammonium nitrate, barrels made of plastic similar to fragments found at the bombing site, 33 firearms, anti-government warfare literature, a receipt for ammonium nitrate fertilizer with McVeigh&#x27;s fingerprints on it, a telephone credit card that McVeigh had used when he was shopping for bomb-making equipment, and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City. Nichols was held as a material witness to the bombing until he was charged on May 10.

Investigators also combed the Decker, Michigan, farm of James Nichols where Terry Nichols and McVeigh had stayed intermittently in the months preceding the bombing. James was held in custody on charges that he made small bombs on the farm but was released without charges on May 24, with the judge saying there was no evidence he was a danger to others.

==Prosecutions==

=== Federal case ===

McVeigh was tried before Nichols and sentenced to death. Former army soldier and friend of Nichols, Michael Fortier, testified against both McVeigh and Nichols. Fortier had entered into a federal plea agreement for reduced charges in return for his agreement to testify. He was charged with failing to notify authorities in advance of the crime and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Fortier testified that Nichols and McVeigh had expressed anti-government feelings and conspired to blow up the Murrah federal building. He said he helped McVeigh survey the building before the attack. He also testified that Nichols had robbed an Arkansas gun dealer to finance the cost of the bombing. Fortier provided &quot;solid bricks of evidence&quot; for the cases against McVeigh and Nichols, according to the prosecutor.

Nichols&#x27; wife Marife testified as a defense witness, but her story may have helped the prosecution&#x27;s case. She said her husband had been living a double life prior to the bombing, using aliases, renting storage lockers and lying that he had broken off his relationship with McVeigh. She also testified that Nichols traveled to Oklahoma City three days before the bombing, supporting the prosecution&#x27;s contention that Nichols helped McVeigh station a getaway car near the Murrah building. Marife also failed to give Nichols an alibi for April 18, 1995, the day the prosecution said Nichols helped McVeigh assemble the truck bomb.

Nichols was represented by criminal defense attorney Michael Tigar. The trial lasted nine weeks with the prosecution calling 100 witnesses tying Nichols to McVeigh and the bombing plot. The prosecution argued that Nichols helped McVeigh purchase and steal bomb ingredients, park the getaway car near the Murrah building and assemble the bomb. The defense attempted to cast doubt on the case against Nichols by calling witnesses who said they saw other men with McVeigh before the bombing and by claiming the government had manipulated the evidence against Nichols.

The jury deliberated for 41 hours over a period of six days, acquitting Nichols on December 24, 1997, of actually detonating the bomb, but convicting him of conspiring with McVeigh to use a weapon of mass destruction, a capital offense. They acquitted Nichols on the charges of first degree (premeditated) murder, but convicted him on the lesser charge of involuntary (unintentional) manslaughter in the deaths of the federal law enforcement officers.

In assessing why Nichols was not convicted of first degree murder, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted: Another theory is that some members of the jury believed Nichols&#x27; attorneys&#x27; arguments that he had withdrawn from the conspiracy before the bombing. His apparent remorse as shown by his crying several times during the testimony could also have swayed the jury.

After the penalty hearing concluded, the jury deliberated for 13 hours over two days on whether to give Nichols a death sentence, but deadlocked. U.S. District Court Judge Richard P. Matsch then had the option of giving Nichols a sentence of life imprisonment or a lesser term. On June 4, 1998, he sentenced Nichols to life in prison without parole on the conspiracy conviction, calling Nichols &quot;an enemy of the Constitution&quot; who had conspired to destroy everything the Constitution protects. Nichols also received a concurrent 48-year sentence for his eight involuntary manslaughter convictions, six for each victim. Nichols showed no emotion. He was sent to the Federal Supermax Prison in Florence, Colorado. On February 26, 1999, a federal appeals court affirmed Nichols&#x27; conviction and sentence.

=== Oklahoma state case ===
After the federal jury deadlocked on the death penalty, which resulted in a life sentence, citizens of Oklahoma petitioned to empanel a state court grand jury to investigate the bombing. State representative Charles Key led a citizens group that circulated the petitions. It was hoped that evidence implicating other conspirators would be uncovered. A grand jury heard testimony for 18 months about allegations of other accomplices but returned only the indictments against Nichols in March 1999. Oklahoma County District Attorney Wes Lane denied the state prosecution was conducted solely for the purpose of having Nichols executed, saying it was important Nichols be convicted of killing all the victims. &quot;This case has always been about 161 men, women and children and an unborn baby having the same rights to their day in court as eight federal law enforcement officers&quot;, Lane said.

Nichols was brought from the prison in Colorado to Oklahoma in January 2000 to face the state trial on 160 capital counts of first-degree murder and one count each of fetal homicide, first-degree arson, and conspiracy. The prosecutor&#x27;s goal was to get the death penalty.

During the two-month trial, the prosecution presented a &quot;mountain of circumstantial evidence&quot;, calling 151 witnesses. Their star witness was Fortier, who said Nichols was intimately involved in the conspiracy and had helped obtain bomb ingredients including fertilizer that was mixed with high octane fuel. Fortier also testified that McVeigh and Nichols stole cord and blasting caps from a rock quarry, and that Nichols robbed a gun collector to obtain money for the plot. Nichols&#x27; lawyers said he was the &quot;fall guy&quot; and that others had conspired with McVeigh. They wanted to introduce evidence that a group of white supremacists had been McVeigh&#x27;s accomplices. However, the judge did not allow them to do so, saying that the defense had not shown that any of these people committed acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. In their concluding argument, the defense said, &quot;People who are still unknown assisted Timothy McVeigh.&quot; On May 26, 2004, the six-man, six-woman jury took five hours to reach guilty verdicts on all charges. When the verdict was read, Nichols showed no emotion, staring straight ahead.

The penalty phase of the trial started on June 1, 2004. The same jury that determined Nichols&#x27;s guilt would also determine whether he would be put to death. During the five-day hearing, 87 witnesses were called including victims and family members of Nichols. Nichols&#x27;s relatives testified that he was a loving family man. During the closing arguments, the prosecutor argued for the death penalty, stating that 168 people had died so that Nichols and McVeigh &quot;could make a political statement&quot;. The defense argued that Nichols had been controlled by a &quot;dominant, manipulative&quot; McVeigh and urged jurors not to be persuaded by the &quot;flood of tears&quot; of the victims who testified. The defense also said that Nichols had &quot;sincerely&quot; converted to Christianity. After 19½ hours of deliberation over a three-day period, the jury could not reach a unanimous decision on the death penalty. With the death penalty no longer an option, Nichols spoke publicly for the first time in the proceedings, making a lengthy statement laced with religious references to Judge Steven W. Taylor. Nichols also apologized for the murders and offered to write to survivors to &quot;assist in their healing process&quot;. Darlene Welch, whose niece was killed in the explosion, said she &quot;didn&#x27;t appreciate being preached to&quot; by Nichols and that she regretted that &quot;he won&#x27;t stand before God sooner.&quot; Judge Taylor called Nichols a terrorist and said &quot;No American citizen has ever brought this kind of devastation; you are in U.S. history the No. 1 mass murderer -- in all of U.S. history&quot; and sentenced Nichols to 161 consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole. Nichols was returned to the federal prison in Colorado.

==Post-conviction==
===Additional explosives===
Acting on a tip from reputed mobster Greg Scarpa Jr. (son of mobster Greg Scarpa Sr.), a fellow inmate of Nichols, the FBI searched the crawl space of Nichols&#x27;s former home in Kansas ten years after the bombing. They found explosives in boxes, wrapped in plastic, buried under a foot of rock. The tipster had indicated that the explosives were buried before the attack.

===Allegations by Nichols===
McVeigh, Nichols, and Fortier were the only defendants indicted in the bombing. Nichols denied his involvement in the plot until 2004. Nichols&#x27;s mother claimed that her son had Asperger syndrome, was manipulated by McVeigh and didn&#x27;t know what the bomb was for. In a May 2005 letter that he wrote to a relative of two of the victims, Nichols claimed that an Arkansas gun dealer also conspired in the 1995 bombing plot by donating some of the explosives that were used. In a 2006 letter requesting that a judge give his son a light sentence for assault with a deadly weapon, battery of a police officer, and possession of a stolen vehicle, Nichols admitted his participation in the Oklahoma City bombing but said that McVeigh had forced and intimidated him into cooperating.

In a 2007 affidavit, Nichols claimed that in 1992 McVeigh claimed to have been recruited for undercover missions while serving in the military. Nichols also said that in 1995 McVeigh told him that FBI official Larry Potts, who had supervised the Ruby Ridge and Waco operations, had directed McVeigh to blow up a government building. Nichols claimed that he and McVeigh had learned how to make the bomb from individuals they met while attending gun shows. In the same affidavit, Nichols admitted that he and McVeigh stole eight cases of the gel type explosive Tovex from a Marion, Kansas quarry, some of which was later used in the Oklahoma City truck bomb. Nichols, who had been employed in Marion County as a ranch hand, was familiar with numerous quarries there. He admitted that he had helped McVeigh mix the bomb ingredients in the truck the day before the attack, but he denied that he knew the exact target of the bomb. Nichols wanted to testify in more detail in a videotaped deposition, but a federal appeals court ruled against it in 2009.

<doc id="392559" wikidata="Q869709" url="?curid=392559" title="Geneva Initiative">
<text>The Geneva Initiative, also known as the Geneva Accord, is a draft &quot;Permanent Status Agreement&quot; to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, based on previous official negotiations, international resolutions, the Quartet Roadmap, the Clinton Parameters, and the Arab Peace Initiative. The document was finished on 12 October 2003. 

The Accord was prepared in secret for over 2 years before the 50-page document was officially launched on 1 December 2003, at a ceremony in Geneva, Switzerland. Among its creators were formal negotiators and architects of previous rounds of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, including former Israeli minister and politician Yossi Beilin and former Palestinian Authority minister Yasser Abed Rabbo. Both noted that the Geneva accord did not obligate either of their respective governments, even though Abed Rabbo was a minister at the time of writing. The Initiative got broad international support, but was heavily criticised by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

In September 2009, a detailed expanded version of the plan was released. The annexes serve as a supplement to the Geneva Accord, outlining the practical measures required for successful implementation of the two-state solution. They cover key issues including security, border crossings, the Implementation and Verification Group (IVG), roads, water management, environmental concerns, the economy, and the division of Jerusalem.

On 25 January 2022, the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) announced it would gradually withdraw its financial support for the Geneva Initiative, effectively ending it by 2023.

== Outline ==
The Geneva Initiative addresses and presents a comprehensive solution to all issues vital to ensuring the end of the conflict and the realization of the national visions of both parties. It would give the Palestinians almost all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip drawing Israel&#x27;s borders close to what existed prior to the Israeli control of territory at the culmination of the 1967 war.

The plan has much similarity with the 2000 Camp David Summit and Taba Summit proposals, and Olmert&#x27;s 2008 Napkin map. Only settlements along the Green Line would be annexed by Israel with mutual land swaps, including Ma&#x27;ale Adumim, Pisgat Ze&#x27;ev and Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev. In the Geneva Initiative, Ariel would be dismantled and the Palestinians be given more sovereignty over East Jerusalem. Jerusalem would be divided administratively, with East Jerusalem (&quot;Al-Quds&quot;) serving as the capital of the Palestinian state and West Jerusalem (&quot;Yerushalayim&quot;) as the capital of Israel. A Multinational Force would play an important role. In return for removing most of the Israeli settlements, the Palestinians would limit their &quot;right of return&quot; of refugees to Israel to a number specified by the Israeli government and would put an end to any further claims and demands from Israel.

== Summary ==

=== Key concepts ===
The key concepts included in the Geneva Accord are:
* A mutual Israeli–Palestinian declaration of an end to the conflict and future claims.
* Mutual recognition of both nations and their right to an independent state.
* Almost complete Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 borders, with a limited number of settlement blocs on the basis of a 1:1 land swap.
* A comprehensive solution to the issue of the Palestinian refugees based on the Clinton Parameters (2000); of which the main component will be compensation and a return to an independent Palestinian State.
* Jewish Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and Arab Jerusalem as Palestine’s capital with Jewish areas under Israeli sovereignty and Arab areas under Palestinian sovereignty.
* A non-militarized Palestinian state and detailed security arrangements.

=== Refugees ===
The proposal for the Palestinian refugee problem is modeled after UNGAR 194, UNSC Resolution 242, and the Arab Peace Initiative. It outlines a compensation plan for recognition of &quot;Refugeehood&quot; and loss of property and a remuneration plan for states that have hosted Palestinian refugees. The Geneva Accord outlines multiple options and modalities for refugees to exercise a choice of permanent place of residence (PPR) in accordance with clauses set forth in the document, some of which include the option to elect to remain in their present host countries, or relocate to third countries, among them Israel, at the sovereign discretion of third countries.

=== Borders and territory ===
The Geneva Accord bases the International Border between the States of Palestine and Israel on the June 4th 1967 lines, in accordance with UNSC Resolution 242 and UNSC Resolution 338, with reciprocal modifications in the form of landswaps on a 1:1 basis. Israel will annex several areas currently densely populated by Jewish settlements near the Green Line (such as Gush Etzion). In return for areas annexed by Israel from the West Bank, the Palestinians will receive territory of equal area and quality adjacent mostly to the Gaza Strip. The State of Israel will assume responsibility for resettling the Israelis living in what would be determined as Palestinian sovereign territory such as Ariel and other settlements.

=== Jerusalem ===
The sharing of Jerusalem will be addressed along the Clinton Parameters. Jewish Jerusalem will serve as Israel’s capital and Arab Jerusalem as Palestine’s capital. Each state would be sovereign over the neighborhoods predominately inhabited by its respective community. The Old City will be open and free to movement and the parties will commit to safeguarding the character, holiness, and freedom of worship in the city. The Implementation and Verification Group will act as an impartial international presence to monitor and verify the preservation of cultural heritage in the Old City in accordance with UNESCO World Heritage List rules. The IVG will establish an Old City Policing Unit to perform policing duties to defuse local tensions and resolve disputes.

=== International supervision ===
An Implementation and Verification Group (IVG) will be established to facilitate, assist in, guarantee, monitor, and resolve disputes relating to the implementation of the agreement. Under the authority of the IVG would be a Multinational Force (MF) which will serve to provide security guarantees to the Parties, act as a deterrent, and oversee the implementation of the relevant provisions of the agreement. The specific details related to the composition of the MF and responsibilities of the IVG as a whole are outlined in the annexes.

== Support ==
=== Palestine and Israel ===
Yasser Arafat praised the &quot;brave initiative that opens the door to peace&quot;. It was reported by Palestinian sources that Arafat and Ahmed Qurei had approved the Geneva initiative in principle but not the details, and sent official representatives to the launching ceremony.

&quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reported on 10 March 2008 that influential Palestinian figure Marwan Barghouti had told Israeli politician Haim Oron &quot;that it was possible for Israel and the Palestinians to reach a final-status agreement along the lines of the Geneva Initiative&quot;. A June 2010 poll conducted by the Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah found support for the Geneva/Clinton Parameters running at about 49% amongst Palestinians and 52% among Israelis. The level of opposition was equal at 49% in the Palestinian community, but stood at 37% for Israelis. 

=== United States ===
* George W. Bush: &quot;[The Geneva Accord] is productive, so long as they adhere to the principles [to] fight off terror, that there must be security, and there must be the emergence of a Palestinian state that is democratic and free.&quot;
* Colin Powell: &quot;The U.S. remains committed to the President&#x27;s two-state vision and to the road map, but we also believe that projects such as yours are important in helping to sustain an atmosphere of hope in which Israelis and Palestinians can discuss mutually acceptable resolutions to the difficult issues that confront them.&quot;
* Bill Clinton: &quot;That&#x27;s why the agreement in Geneva is so important. ... Such efforts prove that Israelis and Palestinians of goodwill can agree on even the most vexing settlement issues.&quot;

=== Other international support ===

* Fifty-eight former presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers and other global leaders, among them former presidents Mikhail Gorbachev of the Soviet Union and F.W. de Klerk of South Africa, issued a statement expressing &quot;strong support&quot; for the plan. Other world leaders who voiced their backing included King Mohammed VI of Morocco, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Clinton.

== Criticism ==

===Palestinian criticism ===
Palestinian support was not universal. Some strongly opposed the plan and its apparent trade-off of the Palestinian right of return in exchange for statehood.
Jamal Zakut, one of the participants and drafters of the plan from the Palestinian side, argued that the section dealing with the refugee issue has &quot;certain ambiguity&quot; and the whole purpose of this document is only to be a model for a future agreement. &quot;The document does not indicate or ensure full and collective return of millions of Palestinians but neither does it waive this right … the document is only another tool by which we continue the struggle to restore our national rights and achieve peace as confirmed by international community and nothing more&quot;.
=== Israeli criticism ===
Upon the Geneva Accord&#x27;s release in 2003, the government of Israel headed by Ariel Sharon criticized the accord.

A publicity campaign on the Israel Broadcasting Authority stations was cancelled after an Israel Radio investigation raised suspicions of questionable financing. Silvan Shalom, who was the Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel at the time, revealed the significant foreign national funding of Beilin&#x27;s plan, and the Israeli government protested this foreign meddling in internal affairs.

== Follow-up ==
Since the writing of the Geneva Accord, the Geneva Initiative developed two cooperating not-for-profit associations / Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), Heskem (H.L. Education for Peace/Geneva Initiative-Israel) on the Israeli side and their Palestinian counterpart Palestine Peace Coalition/Geneva Initiative (PPC/GI). The organizations work together and among their respective communities to promote the Accord’s mission of a negotiated agreement between Israel and Palestine, and to prepare public opinion and leadership to be accepting of the compromises required to solve the conflict.

The Geneva Initiative NGOs educate and campaign, both locally and internationally, that it is in the best interest of Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate directly in order to reach a sustainable two-state solution.
