<text>Sandomierz ( ; , ) is a historic town in south-eastern Poland with 23,863 inhabitants (), situated on the Vistula River near its confluence with the San, in the Sandomierz Basin. It has been part of Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship (Holy Cross Province) since its transfer from the Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship in 1999. It is the capital of Sandomierz County. Sandomierz is known for its preserved Old Town, a major cultural and tourist attraction which the President of Poland declared a National Monument of Poland in 2017. 

In the past, Sandomierz was one of the most important urban centers not only of Lesser Poland, but also of the whole country. It was a royal city of the Polish Crown and functioned as a regional administrative centre from the High Middle Ages to the 19th century.

== Etymology ==
The name of the city might have originated from the Old Polish &#x27;, composed of &#x27; (from the verb &#x27; &quot;to judge&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;peace&quot;), or more likely from the antiquated given name Sędzimir, once popular in several Slavic languages. Sandomierz is known in Latin as and in Yiddish as (). Sandor is short form of Aleksander. “Mierz” means measure in Polish language. In conclusion this land is named Sandor’s measure, or Sandor’s Land.

==History==
===Early history===

Sandomierz is one of the oldest and historically most significant cities in Poland. Archeological finds around the city indicate that humans have inhabited the area since neolithic times. The city came into existence in the early Middle Ages, taking advantage of an excellent location at the junction of Vistula and San rivers, and on the path of important trade routes. The first known historical mention of the city comes from the early 12th-century, when the chronicler Gallus Anonymus ranked it together with Kraków and Wrocław as one of the main cities of Poland. The testament (ca 1115–1118) of Bolesław III Wrymouth, in which he divided Poland among his sons, designated Sandomierz as the capital of one of the resulting principalities, the Duchy of Sandomierz.

In the early 13th century, the second oldest Dominican monastery in Poland (after Kraków) and one of the oldest in Europe was founded in Sandomierz. In the course of the 13th century the city suffered grievous damage during the raids by Mongols in 1241, 1260 and 1287. The old wooden buildings of the town were completely destroyed. As a result, in 1286 the High Duke of Poland Leszek II the Black, effectively refounded the city under Magdeburg Law and granted staple right. The city archives preserve the founding document. (An important note: in 1260, as the Tartars invaded Christian Sandomir, a community of Dominicans was praying Matins while a novice read the martyrology for the next day: &quot;the 49 martyrs of Sandomir&quot;. When the friars realized they were being warned of their death, they spent the remainder of the night and all the next day preparing to meet the Lord. At last, after the brethren had finished praying Compline, and as they processed singing the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; to Mary, the Tartars broke through the church door. While the Tartars intended to bring death to these Dominicans, they actually brought them great gifts - crowns of martyrdom. Ever since, at the death of every Dominican a song to his Beloved Mother is sung to usher him into her arms - the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (or &quot;Hail, Holy Queen&quot;).

After the re-unification of the Polish lands in the 14th century, the former principality became the Sandomierz Voivodeship, incorporating large areas of southeastern Poland. Until 1474, it was one of two voivodeships (administrative area/province) of Lesser Poland, together with Kraków Voivodeship. In 1474, Lublin Voivodeship was created from eastern part of Sandomierz Voivodeship. At this time Sandomierz had about 3,000 inhabitants and was one of the largest Polish cities. In the middle of the 14th century the city was burned again during a raid by the Lithuanians. It was rebuilt during the rule of king Casimir III of Poland, who extended its privileges. The layout of the city has survived practically unchanged since that time until the present day. In 1389 in Sandomierz the newly appointed prince of the Novgorod Republic, Lithuanian prince Lengvenis, paid homage to Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło, thus making Novgorod a fiefdom of the Kingdom of Poland.

===Modern era===

Over centuries, Sandomierz was in competition with the nearby town of Opatòw for the seat of regional administrations. In 1570 an alliance of non-Catholic Polish Churches, the Lutherans, the Reformed, and the Bohemian Brethren, drew up what is known as the &quot;Sandomierz Agreement&quot;, effecting a confederation of the work in order to stave off defeat at the hands of the Roman Church. Thanks to the efforts of the local starost Hieronim Gostomski, the Jesuits settled in the city and founded the Collegium Gostomianum, one Poland&#x27;s oldest high schools, at the beginning of the 17th century.

The early modern period, running until the middle of the 17th century, was quite prosperous for the city. The most important historical buildings were built during this period. This golden age came to an end in 1655 when Swedish forces captured the city in the course of the Deluge. After briefly holding out in the city, the withdrawing Swedes blew up the castle and caused heavy damage to other buildings. In the next 100 years the economy of Poland suffered a decline, which also affected the city. A great fire in 1757 and the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, which placed Sandomierz in Austria, further reduced its status. As a result, Sandomierz lost its role as an administrative capital. In 1774, the oldest extant Polish piano was constructed in Sandomierz. The 3rd Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in Sandomierz in 1792.

Fighting of the Austro-Polish War of 1809 caused damage to the city. Following the Polish victory, it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw and after 1815 it found itself in the Russian Empire (Congress Poland). At this point the city had just 2640 inhabitants.

====Sandomierz Cathedral and St Paul&#x27;s Church blood painting====
This cathedral contains a series of paintings built into the church&#x27;s wooden panelling depicting the &quot;Martyrologium Romanum&quot;. The third painting shows the scene which, it is claimed: &quot;...depicts ritual murders committed in Sandomierz by Jews on Christian children. The inscription above the painting reads &quot;filius apothecary ab infidelibus judaeis sandomiriensibus occisus&quot; (son of an apothecary, by infidel Sandomierz Jews killed) 

The St Paul&#x27;s Church contains a different series of paintings including one in the chancel, depicting the torment of Jerzy Krassowski who was allegedly strangled by the Jews. Discussion on these pictures has taken place with the participation of the Polish Jewish Community.&quot;The Polish Council of Christians and Jews has offered to finance a plaque with explanations of the painting and information about the official statements by various Popes&quot;. This plaque is now displayed in the St Paul&#x27;s Church next to the picture in question.

===The world wars===

The city again suffered damage during World War I. In 1918, it again became part of independent Poland. In the 1930s, due to the massive public works project known as the Central Industrial Area, Sandomierz began to grow quickly. It was projected to become capital of the Sandomierz Voivodeship, and local authorities planned fast development of the city. The &quot;Greater Sandomierz&quot; was to turn in the 1940s into a city of 120,000.

In September 1939, following the German invasion of Poland, the city was occupied by Germany and made part of the General Government. The Polish and Jewish population were subjected to various crimes. Poles who were expelled by the Germans from annexed Złoczew in late 1939 were deported to Sandomierz. Others were conscripted for forced labour and many were sent to labor camps. The largest mass arrests of Poles, including teachers, local officials and activists, were carried out in March 1940. Poles were then held in the local prison and deported to Nazi concentration camps. In June 1940 in Brzask Forest, Germans murdered 760 Poles as part of the German AB-Aktion in Poland directed to exterminate Polish intelligentsia. Bodies were buried in an unnamed mass grave. That was the largest massacre in the Kielce Region. At the same time, the nearby village of Góry Wysokie was the site a massacre of 117 Poles from the region. Despite this, the Polish underground resistance movement was active in Sandomierz, and in late 1940 it even launched a secret printing house in Sandomierz and issued the Polish underground newspaper &quot;Odwet&quot;, which was also distributed to nearby villages. In March 1942, the Germans carried out mass arrests of around 150 members of the Polish resistance. Among those arrested was local Polish writer Roman Koseła, one of several Polish writers murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp.

In May 1942, the Jewish and Polish population were confined to a ghetto area and hundreds of Jews and Poles from around the region were brought there, increasing the population to more than 5000. In October 1942, about 3,000 prisoners were sent to Bełżec where they were immediately gassed. After that deportation, hundreds of Jews came out of hiding and others were sent to Sandomierz from elsewhere. Now the population was more than 6000 confined to another ghetto where as many as twelve people shared each room and some lived in the streets. Sanitary conditions were horrid and many became ill. Those who reported to the hospital were usually shot after a few days. Some prisoners during this time were sent to labor camps, but in January 1943, the SS and German police, surrounded the ghetto, set some houses on fire and bombed others. They rounded up 7,000 people, send a few hundred to a labor camp, and escorted the rest to the railway station, shooting hundreds en route. The trains took the prisoners to Treblinka where they were murdered by gas the same day. Poles who were not sent to camps were persecuted for helping Jews, some were even imprisoned for barely &quot;transporting Jews illegally&quot;. 

The city was captured by the Red Army in August 1944. Unlike many Polish cities, it managed to avoid destruction; the merit of protecting the city is attributed to the military skill of the Soviet Lieutenant Colonel Vasyl Skopenko, who led the operation. His grave with a monument was located near the Opatowska Gate, but in 1990, by the decision of Mayor Tomasz Panfil, it was moved to the Soviet military cemetery on Mickiewicz Street; this was one of the first public acts of decommunization in Poland.

No major industrial development took place in Sandomierz during the communist era, thus preserving its look of a charming, small city full of historical monuments among the unspoiled landscape.

== Climate ==
The city experiences a humid continental climate with notably warm summers (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), much more consistently pronounced in eastern Poland. Precipitation, especially in the form of rains, is concentrated in the summer, reducing until the end of winter. Sandomierz has four well defined seasons of the year, hot summers (sometimes), usually bearable and cold winters but with slightly moderate extremes.

<text>Tarnobrzeg is a city in south-eastern Poland (historic Lesser Poland), on the east bank of the river Vistula, with 49,419 inhabitants, as of 31 December 2009. Situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (Polish: &quot;Województwo podkarpackie&quot;) since 1999, it had previously been the capital of Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship (1975–1998). Tarnobrzeg lies in the Sandomierz Basin, and directly borders the town of Sandomierz, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship. Its history dates back to the year 1593, when it was granted Magdeburg rights, and belonged to the Tarnowski family. For centuries Tarnobrzeg remained a small town, which did not develop until the post-World War II period, when it became center of an industrial area, based on rich sulfur deposits.

== Etymology ==
The name Tarnobrzeg refers to the founders of the town, the Tarnowski family. Other names were suggested, such as &quot;Tarnodwor&quot;, &quot;Nowo Dwor&quot;, and &quot;Nowy Tarnów&quot;. Finally, Tarnobrzeg prevailed, and other towns, founded by the Tarnowski family, were also named in a similar fashion, such as Tarnogród and Tarnopol.

Until the 20th century, however, the name Tarnobrzeg was not popular among residents. In common use were such names, as Dzików (see also Dzików Castle) and Miechocin, as these two locations were older, larger and more important. After opening of a rail station called Tarnobrzeg (1887), and creation of the Tarnobrzeg County (1920), the name caught on and became commonly used. Nevertheless, patron saint of the region, is still called Our Lady of Dzików (see also Dominican Church and Convent of Assumption of Mary in Tarnobrzeg).

== Location and area ==
Tarnobrzeg lies along National Road 9, which is part of the European route E371. The town also is a railroad hub, with five stations located within its limits (Ocice, Sobow, Tarnobrzeg, Tarnobrzeg Waskotorowy and Wielowieś). Rail lines stem from Tarnobrzeg into four directions: southwards towards Dębica, southeast towards Rzeszów, east towards Stalowa Wola, and northwards, towards Sandomierz.

Currently Tarnobrzeg is one of the largest towns of Poland in terms of territory. It covers the area of , and the distance between its extreme northern and southern locations reaches . This is because, in 1975, Tarnobrzeg unexpectedly became the capital of a newly created province, Tarnobrzeg Voivodeship. To expand the town, local authorities initiated a policy of annexation of local villages. As a result, in the late 1970s, the size of the town quickly grew, when several villages and settlements (Machow, Dzików, Miechocin, Wielowieś, Sielec, Podleze, Sobow, Mokrzyszow) became part of Tarnobrzeg as its districts. The Old Town and historic center of Tarnobrzeg covers a very small area of the town, as 80% of Tarnobrzeg was built after the war.

== History ==

Tarnobrzeg was founded in 1593, during the golden age of Poland, to become the residence of the Tarnowski family (see szlachta). In that year, King Sigismund III Vasa granted Magdeburg rights to the village (May 28, 1593). The founder of the town was Stanislaw Tarnowski, Castellan of Sandomierz. In 1772, it became part of the Austrian Empire and remained in the province of Galicia until November 1918. Tarnobrzeg, located very close to the Russian-Austrian border, sustained heavy damage during World War I by invading armies.

In the aftermath of World War I, the short-lived Republic of Tarnobrzeg was declared here, and in 1919, the town became part of Lwów Voivodeship of the newly independent Second Polish Republic. The city suffered significant emigration within the former Austrian empire and elsewhere during the interbellum years (1919–1939). A public school system was founded during that time.

In the 1950s, after geological research into fuel deposits, significant sulfur resources were discovered. From the early 1960s the city grew rapidly: the population rose from 5,000 to 50,000 in 1990s. After closing the sulfur mine &quot;Siarkopol&quot; in Machów and Jeziórko a stagnation of Tarnobrzeg followed. In 1999 it ceased being a Voivodeship capital and became a city-county (powiat grodzki).

Timeline of Tarnobrzeg history (note: the history of Tarnobrzeg itself is not very long. Much older are several districts of the contemporary town, such as Wielowieś in its north, and Miechocin in the south).

=== Tarnowski family ===

The history of Tarnobrzeg is closely tied with the noble Leliwita family, which in the 16th century changed its name into Tarnowski. In 1349 Rafal of Tarnów married a woman named Dzierzka, who was the owner of Wielowieś, moving there after the wedding. Their estate gradually expanded, in 1365 they purchased Trzesn and Rzochow, in 1375 Sielec and Sobow, and in 1397, Jan Tarnowski purchased several villages. In the late 15th century, Jan Spytek Tarnowski purchased, among others, Dzików, together with its fortified stronghold. Stanislaw Tarnowski (1541–1609), who was a courtier of Kings Stefan Batory and Sigismund III, managed to convince the latter to grant town charter to Nowy Tarnów, later called Tarnobrzeg. His son Michal Stanislaw (1590–1654) in the 1620s began expansion and modernization of the town, planning a street system together with a market square with a town hall. Furthermore, he expanded the Dzików stronghold and the church at Miechocin.

The development of Nowy Tarnów was stopped during the catastrophic Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660), when the town was destroyed by the Swedes. After the invasion, Jan Stanislaw Tarnowski funded a Dominican Monastery, with the painting of Our Lady of Dzików (1678), which was moved there from the Dzików Castle. In 1734, the Dzików Confederation was formed in the Dzików Castle, and among its creators was Jozef Mateusz Tarnowski. In the late 18th century, the castle was remodelled in the late Baroque style, and last owners of Dzików were Jan Zdzislaw Tarnowski (1862–1937), and Artur Tarnowski (1903–1984).

=== Jewish community ===

Pre-Holocaust Tarnobrzeg, a shtetl of western Galicia, was home to a thriving traditional Jewish community. Tarnobrzeg is situated in a region of Poland that is relatively distant from the better-known, larger Jewish communities of the country which were located in cities such as Warsaw, Kraków, Lublin, Lwów, and Wilno. Nonetheless, the History of Jews in Poland is confluent with the history of the town. Jewish inhabitants of Tarnobrzeg, and their descendants, are considered Galitzianers or Galician Jews.

In the years 1772–1918 (see: Partitions of Poland), Tarnobrzeg was in the province of Galicia as part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, based in Vienna. The 19th century after 1815 was, across Europe, a period of relative peace and stability following the conclusion of the extremely violent Napoleonic Wars. Due to progressive initiatives following Napoleonic times, Tarnobrzeg citizens including the Jewish community benefited from free compulsory public education mandated by the Austrian Emperor. The same was not true for other Polish Jewry in areas outside of Galicia (e.g., Danzig or Warsaw). Compulsory public education was opposed by some Jewish religious authorities who believed that traditional Jewish Torah and Talmud studies should not even be partially supplanted by secular instruction.

The political stability in Tarnobrzeg and surrounding areas that ended with the collapse of the Austrian Empire as a result of World War I portended a difficult future for Tarnobrzeg&#x27;s Jews. Although atrocities and population displacements during World War II dominated the history of Tarnobrzeg&#x27;s Jews, deportations during World War I to trans-Ural Russia were also highly disruptive and destroyed much of the established community. Many emigrated to the United States or Palestine.

Nearby &quot;shtetlach&quot; (of, e.g., Rozwadów and Ulanów) had many commercial and family ties to Tarnobrzeg. There were several affinity groups among the thriving Jewish population before World War II, including Hasidic, Zionist, Bundist, and others. Many Jewish citizens of Tarnobrzeg emigrated to Palestine, later to become Israel, during the pre-World War II period.

A prominent Tarnobrzeg citizen, Moses Hauser, who was Jewish, was a centenarian whose lifespan nearly coincided with the 19th century. Hauser was a wealthy businessman, trader, and landholder dating from Napoleonic times through the reign of Austrian Emperor Franz Josef. His life is documented in a &quot;Yizkor&quot; (Memorial) book published by Tarnobrzeg elders following the Holocaust. Hauser was father to twelve children and many descendants who reside in the United States, Israel, and elsewhere.

===World War II===
Prior to Nazi German and Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, there were 3,800 Jewish residents in Tarnobrzeg. The city was overrun by the Germans on 17 September 1939. In order to inflict terror, five prominent Jews were shot at the town square. Following the signing of the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty Jews were being expelled to the Soviet zone of occupation across the San river beginning 2 October 1939, with many others, deported to Mielec and Sandomierz. The atrocities committed by the German occupiers against Jews and other Polish citizens during the Holocaust forced the Jews to choose between mortally dangerous escape or perish by remaining. Very few Jews are known to have survived in the city, where they would have needed to be hidden for years by righteous gentiles. Those migrating east to Russia had to choose between permanent Soviet citizenship, service in the Red Army in its battles against the Wehrmacht, and loss of freedom to subsequently leave Russia, or alternatively to become displaced persons (DPs). The DPs were temporarily relocated by the Russian government to work camps in Siberia, there to wait out the war. Many of them died due to the extremely rugged conditions, for which they were unprepared, and the poor supplies available in wartime trans-Ural Russian Asia. Those who survived were permitted to depart Russian lands following World War II.

== Economy ==
The city was a major center for the mining and processing of sulphur and sulphuric acid. However, due to declining profitability, its mines have closed. The mine in Piaseczno was closed first, followed by the Machów mine (after 40 years of working — it had been the biggest open-cast sulphur mine in Europe), and finally the Jeziórko mine in the 1990s. The Jeziórko mine stayed open as long as it did because of the introduction of the modern Frasch process of sulphur extraction.

Since the 1980s, the land in the mining areas has gradually been reclaimed. The Machów mine has been filled with water to form a reservoir used for recreation, and the same is happening to the Jeziórko mine — it is being slowly filled from the nearby Vistula river.

<text>Stalowa Wola () is the largest city and capital of Stalowa Wola County with a population of 58,545 inhabitants, as at 31 December 2021. It is located in southeastern Poland in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship. The city lies in historic Lesser Poland near the confluence of the Vistula and the San rivers, and covers an area of .

Stalowa Wola is one of the youngest cities of Poland. It was built from scratch in the late 1930s in the forests surrounding village of Pławo. The city was designed to be a settlement for workers of Huta Stalowa Wola (known in 1938 to 1939 as &quot;Zakłady Poludniowe&quot; or &quot;Southern Works&quot;), a plant built as part of the Central Industrial Region. The name &quot;Stalowa Wola&quot; translates to &quot;Steel Will&quot; in English, reflecting its origins and purpose as a city established to support the steel industry. Stalowa Wola is home to the sports club Stal Stalowa Wola.

== Location and name ==
Stalowa Wola is located in the lowlands of the Sandomierz Basin, near the San river. Even today sixty percent of the total area within its administrative borders () consists of natural pine forests, remnants of once extensive and primeval Sandomierz Forest. The name of the town, Stalowa Wola, can be roughly translated into English as “steel will” and comes from a statement made by General Tadeusz Kasprzycki, Minister of Military Affairs of Poland in the late 1930s in which he declared that the new Polish industrial development plan of the Central Industrial Area symbolizes the &quot;steel will of the Polish nation to modernize itself&quot;.

==History==
The area of today&#x27;s Stalowa Wola belongs to historic Polish province of Lesser Poland. In the Kingdom of Poland, it was located in the south-eastern corner of the Sandomierz Voivodeship, near the border with Red Ruthenia. The city of Stalowa Wola was built on the site where the village of Pławo once stood, between the ancient towns of Nisko and Rozwadów. The first mentions of Pławo come from the first half of the 15th century. At the nearby village of Przyszów, there was a hunting lodge of King Władysław Jagiełło, built before 1358. In the late 15th century, Pławo was a royal village. In 1656, the area of Pławo was the site of a battle between Polish and Swedish armies. Here, in the confluence of the San and Vistula, Swedish troops of King Charles Gustav were surrounded by Stefan Czarniecki (see Swedish invasion of Poland).
Until the Partitions of Poland, Pławo belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship. From 1772 to 1918, it was part of the Austrian province of Galicia and remained an insignificant, privately owned village. In early 1937, the government of the Second Polish Republic accepted the project of the Central Industrial Area, which included the construction of a brand new steel mill, together with a settlement for the workers. Before the outbreak of World War II, some departments of the mill were operational and several blocks of flats were built. Construction of the &quot;Southern Works&quot;, as the mill was then called, was started in dense pine forests around Pławo in March 1937. Among other things, the plant manufactured artillery cannons.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the city was occupied by Nazi Germany. During the war, Stalowa Wola was one of the centres of the Home Army. The settlement was captured by the Red Army in August 1944, and on April 1, 1945, Stalowa Wola received its town charter. In 1948, the mill was renamed as &quot;Huta Stalowa Wola&quot; and in 1953, a separate urban county of Stalowa Wola was created. In 1973, the town of Rozwadów was annexed, followed in 1977 by the village of Charzewice. At its peak in the 1970s, the mill employed 35,000 people, with branches scattered across southern Poland, from Radomsko to Strzyżów. Apart from the mill, Stalowa Wola has a large power plant, opened Spring 1939. In 1988, the city was one of the centres of workers&#x27; protests (see 1988 Polish strikes). Currently, Stalowa Wola is the third-largest city of the voivodeship, with a population of 60,000.
===Jews in Rozwadów===
The Rozwadów suburb of Stalowa Wola was a thriving Jewish shtetl prior to World War II and was closely associated with Tarnobrzeg and other nearby shtetls including Ulanów, Mielec, Dzików etc. These communities, infused with vitality before 1939, were utterly destroyed during the Holocaust after having been affected by World War I only some 20 years earlier. Jews in Rozwadów were a religiously observant community, i.e. traditional or Orthodox in practice. The leading rabbi of Rozwadów, similar to other rabbis of the region, followed Hasidism practice and was of the Horowitz family. In New York, a Rozwadower Rebbe established a small synagogue on the upper West Side, which continued for many decades after the war. There is a link to a yizkor book about Rozwadów which gives further notes on the Jewish life there. The Rozwadów synagogue was, until World War II, located on Attorney Street in the lower east side of NYC.

During World War II, Dr. Eugene Lazowski, a military doctor of the Polish underground Home Army, Armia Krajowa, created a fake epidemic of dangerous infectious disease, Epidemic Typhus in the town of Rozwadów (now a district of Stalowa Wola) and the surrounding villages and towns. He saved an estimated 8,000 Polish Jews from certain death in Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust, performing his services in utmost secrecy under the threat of capital punishment.

Following the Holocaust, the remaining Jews were motivated to seek a new start in Palestine, thanks to Berihah&#x27;s efforts. A community of former Rozwadów citizens had been established in New York City and continued its affinity long after World War II. Many former Rozwadów citizens of Jewish backgrounds moved to the fledgeling State of Israel.

<text>Bochnia is a town on the river Raba in southern Poland, administrative seat of Bochnia County in Lesser Poland Voivodeship. The town lies approximately halfway between Tarnów (east) and the regional capital Kraków (west). Bochnia is most noted for its salt mine, the oldest functioning in Europe, built in the 13th century, a World Heritage Site and a Historic Monument of Poland.

As of December 2021, Bochnia has a population of 29,317 and an area of .

==History==

Bochnia is one of the oldest cities of Lesser Poland. The first known source mentioning the city is a letter of 1198, in which Aymar the Monk, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, confirmed a donation by the local magnate Mikora Gryfit to the monastery of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in Miechów. The discovery of major deposits of rock salt at the site of the present mine in 1248 led to the grant of city privileges (Magdeburg rights) on 27 February 1253 by Bolesław V the Chaste. In the original founding document, the German name of the town (Salzberg) is mentioned as well, since many Bochnia&#x27;s residents were German-speaking settlers from Lower Silesia.
Due to its salt mine and favourable location, Bochnia, which belonged to the Kraków Voivodeship, was one of main cities of Lesser Poland. In the 14th century, during the reign of King Casimir the Great, a town hall was built, a defensive wall with four gates, a hospital and shelter for miners, and the construction of St. Nicolas Basilica began. In appreciation of Casimir&#x27;s influence on the development of Bochnia, monument to him was erected in town&#x27;s market square in the late 19th century. In the 15th century, a school was opened, and in 1623, Bernardine Abbey was founded in Bochnia. At that time, many pilgrims from Lesser Poland, Silesia, Spiš and Orava visited the town, to see a miraculous painting of St. Mary, kept at a local Dominican church.

In 1561 Bochnia burned down in a fire and its salt deposits were depleted, leading to the town&#x27;s decline. During the Deluge, in 1655 Bochnia was captured by the Swedes, in 1657 by the Transylvanians, and in 1662, by the Cossacks. By the 1660s, there were only 54 houses still standing. In 1702, the town was destroyed in the Great Northern War. Fires caused further damage in 1709 and 1751. In 1772, Bochnia was annexed by the Habsburg monarchy (Austria) in the First Partition of Poland, and remained part of Galicia (the Austrian Partition of Poland) until 1918. It became the seat of the , one of the roughly 18 (the exact number varied) primary subdivisions of Galicia until 1860. The Austrians liquidated both abbeys, and tore down the town hall together with the defensive wall. In 1867, was created and the town began a slow recovery spurred by construction of the Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis. In 1886, first public library was opened, in the late 19th century, the waterworks, and in 1913, a movie theater.

Poland regained independence in 1918, and in the Second Polish Republic, Bochnia belonged to Kraków Voivodeship and was the capital of a county. In 1918, the Polish 15th Wolves Infantry Regiment was formed in Bochnia. The town housed a small garrison of the Polish Army, with 3rd Silesian Uhlans Regiment stationed there from 1924.

===World War II===

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on September 6–7, 1939, Bochnia was defended by several Polish units. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town shortly after to commit various crimes against the population. One of the first mass executions in occupied Poland took place in the town: the Germans shot 52 Poles as a reprisal for killing two German police officers. In 1939 the Germans operated a Dulag transit camp for some 1,000 Polish prisoners of war in the town.

At the outbreak of World War II, an estimated 3,500 Jews lived in Bochnia, comprising about 20% of the total population. During the German occupation of Poland, Bochnia was the site of a Nazi Jewish ghetto (the Bochnia Ghetto) to which Jews from surrounding areas were forced to move by the Nazis. The entire Jewish community was murdered in the Holocaust apart from 200 forced laborers employed at a plant headed by Gerhard Kurzbach, a Wehrmacht soldier, who ordered them to work overtime and thereby saved them from deportation. It is estimated that approximately 15,000 Jews were deported from Bochnia, with at least a further 1,800 killed in the town and its surroundings. About 90 Jews from Bochnia survived the war, either in hiding, in camps or in the Soviet Union. Most of them emigrated to the United States, Brazil, Belgium, and Israel.

In April 1943, Polish wartime hero Witold Pilecki hid there after his escape from the Auschwitz concentration camp. In 1944, the 12th Home Army Infantry Regiment was established in Bochnia. In 1944, during and following the Warsaw Uprising, the Germans carried out deportations of Varsovians from the Dulag 121 camp in Pruszków, where they were initially imprisoned, to Bochnia. Those Poles were mainly old people, ill people and women with children.

The Jewish family of Tiders expelled from Zaborowo in 1940 were murdered in Brześć with children except for their oldest son, 24-year-old Mendel Tider, who paved the road to Tamowo on German orders at the time of the killings. He escaped to Bochnia where he met Józef Langdorf from his neighbourhood. Together, they escaped back to Zaborowo and found refuge at the farm of the Mika family of six. Both survived, treated like relatives and fed for free until liberation. In 2000 the three members of the Mika family were bestowed the titles of the Righteous thanks to Mrs Langdorf from Israel. Stefan Mika was 73, and living in Kraków; the other two, father and mother, were already dead for several decades.

===Recent period===
Although Poland was liberated from Germany, it fell to the Soviet sphere of influence, and the Soviets installed a communist regime, which remained in power until 1989. The Polish anti-communist resistance movement was active in Bochnia. In the following decades, Bochnia grew larger, with several villages incorporated into the town, mostly in the 1970s. In 1984, a by-pass of the European route E40 was completed, redirecting the traffic from congested center of the town. From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively part of the Tarnów Voivodeship.

<text>Saturn-Apollo 2 (SA-2) was the second flight of the Saturn I launch vehicle, the first flight of Project Highwater, and was part of the American Apollo program. The rocket was launched on April 25, 1962, from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

== History ==

Launch preparation for the mission began at Cape Canaveral on February 27, 1962, with the arrival of the second Saturn I launch vehicle. The only significant change made to the vehicle from the previous SA-1 flight was the addition of extra baffles in the propellant tanks to mitigate fuel sloshing. While no serious delays were encountered, there were several minor problems reported.

A leak was detected between the liquid oxygen dome and injector for the #4 H-1 rocket engine; while attempts were made to fix the problem, it was eventually decided to launch without replacing the engine. Minor problems were found in the guidance subsystem and service structure operations, damaged strain gauges were found in a liquid oxygen stud and truss member, and a manhole cover on the dummy Centaur (S-V-D) third stage had to be replaced. Problems arose with two of the fueling computers, but each was repaired. Three hydraulic systems were also listed as potential problems.

Despite the issues encountered during flight preparation, none required the target launch date of April 25 to be pushed back.

== Flight ==
Saturn-Apollo 2 was launched at 14:00:34 UTC on April 25, 1962, from Launch Complex 34. The only hold in the countdown sequence was for 30 minutes due to a vessel which entered the flight safety zone down range. The rocket carried of propellant, about 83% of its maximum capacity.

The H-1 engines shut down at an altitude of after firing for 1 minute 55 seconds and reaching a maximum velocity of . The vehicle continued to coast to an altitude of , at which point, 2 minutes 40 seconds after launch, officials sent a terminate command to the rocket, setting off several charges which caused the vehicle to destruct.

== Objectives ==

The objectives of SA-2 were much the same as those of SA-1 in that it was primarily a test of the Saturn I rocket and the new H-1 engines. Specifically, its goals were to prove propulsion performance and mission adequacy, vehicle structural design and aerodynamic characteristics, guidance and control systems, and launch facility and ground support equipment. NASA declared all objectives as successful. Additionally, the fuel sloshing issue from SA-1 was minimized.

A second objective of both this mission and SA-3 was Project Highwater, the intentional release of ballast water from the second and third stages which allowed scientists to investigate the nature of Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, as well as noctilucent clouds and the behavior of ice in space.

SA-2&#x27;s dummy upper stages contained approximately of water, or , used to simulate the mass of future payloads. Stage two contained of water, and stage three contained . When the terminate command was sent to the rocket, dynamite charges split the second stage longitudinally, instantly releasing its water load. Primacord charges created several holes in the third stage, releasing its water over a period of several seconds.

Cameras on the ground immediately recorded the water cloud, and personnel at a ground station began to observe it about four to five seconds after release. Those personnel reported that the cloud dispersed from vision within an average of five seconds, while more sensitive instruments tracked the cloud to a maximum altitude of . The cloud produced lightning-like effects, which Dr. Wernher von Braun described as &quot;probably the first synthetic thunderstorm ever generated in space.&quot; Project Highwater on this flight was also declared a success.

<text>John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell, PC, FRSE (15 September 1779 – 23 June 1861) was a British Liberal politician, lawyer and man of letters.

==Background and education==
The second son of the Reverend George Campbell, D.D., and Magdalene Hallyburton, he was born a son of the manse at Cupar, Fife, Scotland, where his father was for fifty years parish minister. For seven years, from the age of 11, Campbell studied at the United College, St Andrews.

When he was 18, he was offered the opportunity to leave home and see something of the world by becoming tutor to James Wedderburn-Webster. The family lived in Clapham, just south of London, with a summer house at Shenley, Hertfordshire. His employer was David Webster, London merchant of a sugar trading house, with family connections through the Wedderburn baronets to the slave plantations of Jamaica. Living in this wealthy household, the young Campbell saw a different world, and it didn&#x27;t impress him: the commercial conversation and gossip of &quot;West India merchants and East India captains&quot; created an atmosphere &quot;irksome&quot; and &quot;unbearable&quot;. His pupil James was about ten years old; one of Campbell&#x27;s first tasks was to begin to teach him Latin.

Campbell took advantage of being in London to attend a session of the House of Commons, hearing William Wilberforce speak against slavery, followed by Charles James Fox and William Pitt. He describes it vividly in his memoirs forty years later, concluding, &quot;After hearing this debate, I could no longer have been content with being &#x27;Moderator of the General Assembly [of the Church of Scotland]&#x27;.&quot;.

In 1800 Campbell was entered as a student at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and, after working briefly for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, was called to the bar in 1806.

==Legal and political career==
Campbell at once began to report cases decided at &quot;nisi prius&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; on jury trial). Of these reports he published four volumes; they extend from Michaelmas 1807 to Hilary 1816. Campbell also devoted himself to criminal business, but failed to attract much attention behind the bar. It was not until 1827 that Campbell took silk and began to develop political aspirations. He had unsuccessfully contested the borough of Stafford in 1826, but was returned for it in 1830 and again in 1831. He stood as a moderate Whig, in favour of the connection of church and state and opposed to triennial parliaments and the secret ballot. His main object, like Lord Brougham, was the amelioration of the law by the abolition of cumbrous technicalities rather than the assertion of new principles.

To this end his name is associated with the Fines and Recoveries Abolition Act 1833; the Inheritance Act 1833; the Dower Act 1833; the Real Property Limitation Act 1833; the Wills Act 1837; the Copyhold Tenure Act 1841; and the Judgments Act 1838. The second was called for by the preference which the common law gave to a distant collateral over the brother of the half-blood of the first purchaser; the fourth conferred an indefeasible title on adverse possession for twenty years (a term shortened by Lord Cairns in 1875 to twelve years); the fifth reduced the number of witnesses required by law to attest wills, and removed the distinction which existed in this respect between freeholds and copyholds; the last freed an innocent debtor from imprisonment only before final judgment (or on what was termed mesne process), but the principle stated by Campbell that only fraudulent debtors should be imprisoned was ultimately given effect to for England and Wales in 1869.

Perhaps his most important appearance as a member of parliament (MP) for Stafford was in defence of Lord John Russell&#x27;s first Reform Bill (1831). In a speech, based on Charles James Fox&#x27;s declaration against constitution-mongering, he supported both the enfranchising and the disfranchising clauses. The following year (1832) found Campbell Solicitor General, a knight and member for Dudley. Dudley had been enfranchised under the Reform Act 1832 and so Campbell became the first MP to represent the town in modern history. However, his appointment to the post of Attorney General in 1834 led to a by-election, which he lost to Thomas Hawkes. John Campbell returned to Parliament swiftly, however, as he was returned by Edinburgh in 1835, which seat he represented until his ennoblement in 1841. One of his first acts as Attorney General was the prosecution of a bookseller called Henry Hetherington on the charge of blasphemous libel. In this case Campbell gave his opinion that morality depended on divine revelation:

the vast majority of the population believe that morality depends entirely on revelation; and if a doubt could be raised among them that the ten commandments were given by God from Mount Sinai, men would think they were at liberty to steal, and women would think themselves absolved from the restraints of chastity. 
In 1840 Campbell conducted the prosecution against John Frost, one of the three Chartist leaders who attacked the town of Newport, all of whom were found guilty of high treason. Next year, as the Melbourne administration was near its close, Plunkett, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, was forced to resign, and was succeeded by Campbell, who was raised to the peerage as Baron Campbell, of St Andrews in the County of Fife. The post of chancellor Campbell held for only sixteen days, and then resigned it to his successor Sir Edward Sugden. It was during the period 1841–1849, when he had no legal duty, except the self-imposed one of occasionally hearing Scottish appeals in the House of Lords, that Lord Campbell turned to literary pursuits. He bought Hartrigge House in Jedburgh during this period. However, he did take up the cause of the families of railway accident victims in introducing and steering through the Commons, the Fatal Accidents Act 1846, known as Lord Campbell&#x27;s Act.

==Literary endeavours==
Following in the path struck out by Strickland in her &quot;Lives of the Queens of England&quot;, and by Lord Brougham&#x27;s &quot;Lives of Eminent Statesmen&quot;, Campbell produced &quot;Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of England, from the earliest times till the reign of Queen Victoria&quot;, in ten volumes. He followed it with &quot;Lives of the Chief Justices of England&quot;, in four volumes (two additional volumes were a &quot;Continuation by Sir Joseph Arnould – Late Judge of the High Court of Bombay&quot;). He also wrote &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Legal Acquirements Reconsidered&quot;.

==In the House of Lords==

While composing his biographical works Campbell remained active in the House of Lords and spoke frequently against legislation proposed by Sir Robert Peel&#x27;s government. When the Whigs returned to power under Russell in 1846, Campbell became a member of the cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and undertook some of the duties of the ailing Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham. On the resignation of Lord Denman in 1850, Campbell was appointed Chief Justice of the Queen&#x27;s Bench. Although well versed in the common law, Campbell was criticised for attempting to influence juries in their estimate of the credibility of evidence, as was seen in the 1852 Achilli case. He assisted in the reforms of special pleading at Westminster, and had a recognised place with Brougham and Lyndhurst in legal discussions in the House of Lords.

In 1854, Campbell was appointed to the Royal Commission for Consolidating the Statute Law, a royal commission to consolidate existing statutes and enactments of English law.

Campbell was the main sponsor of the Obscene Publications Act 1857 which made the sale of obscene material a statutory offence for the first time, giving the courts power to seize and destroy offending material. The origins of the Act itself were in a trial for the sale of pornography presided over by Campbell, at the same time as a debate in the House of Lords over a bill aiming to restrict the sale of poisons. Campbell was taken by the analogy between the two situations, famously referring to the London pornography trade as &quot;a sale of poison more deadly than prussic acid, strychnine or arsenic&quot;. Campbell proposed a bill to restrict the sale of pornography; giving statutory powers of destruction would allow for a much more effective degree of prosecution. The bill was controversial at the time, receiving strong opposition from both Houses of Parliament, and was passed on the assurance by Campbell, in his capacity of Lord Chief Justice, that it was &quot;... intended to apply exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth and of a nature calculated to shock the common feelings of decency in any well-regulated mind.&quot; The House of Commons successfully amended it so as not to apply to Scotland, on the grounds that Scottish common law was sufficiently stringent.
The Act provided for the seizure and destruction of any material deemed to be obscene, and held for sale or distribution, following information being laid before a &quot;court of summary jurisdiction&quot; (magistrates&#x27; court). The Act required that following evidence of a common-law offence being committed – for example, on the report of a plain-clothes policeman who had successfully purchased the material – the court could issue a warrant for the premises to be searched and the material seized. The proprietor then would be called upon to attend court and give reason why the material should not be destroyed. Critically, the Act did not define &quot;obscene,&quot; leaving this to the will of the courts.

In 1859 Campbell was made Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, possibly on the understanding that Bethell should succeed as soon as he could be spared from the House of Commons. His short tenure was undistinguished, and he died in 1861.

==Family==
In 1821 Campbell married the Hon. Mary Elizabeth, eldest daughter of James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger; they had three sons and four daughters. In 1836 Lady Campbell was created (in her own right) &quot;Baroness Stratheden, of Cupar in the County of Fife&quot;, in recognition of her husband&#x27;s withdrawal of his claim to the office of Master of the Rolls; she died in March 1860, aged 63. Lord Campbell survived her by just over a year and died in June 1861, aged 81. They were succeeded by their eldest son, William, who became Lord Stratheden and Campbell.

<text>Phineas P. Gage (18231860) was an American railroad construction foreman remembered for his improbable survival of an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain&#x27;s left frontal lobe, and for that injury&#x27;s reported effects on his personality and behavior over the remaining 12 years of his lifeeffects sufficiently profound that friends saw him (for a time at least) as &quot;no longer Gage&quot;.

Long known as the &quot;American Crowbar Case&quot;once termed &quot;the case which more than all others is to excite our wonder, impair the value of prognosis, and even to subvert our  doctrines&quot;Phineas Gage influenced 19th-century discussion about the mind and brain, debate on cerebral, and was perhaps the first case to suggest the brain&#x27;s role in , and that damage to specific parts of the brain might induce specific mental changes.

Gage is a fixture in the curricula of neurology, psychology, and neuroscience, one of &quot;the great medical curiosities of all time&quot; and &quot;a living part of the medical folklore&quot; frequently mentioned in books and scientific papers; he even has a minor place in popular culture. Despite this celebrity, the body of established fact about Gage and what he was like (whether before or after his injury) is small, which has allowed &quot;the fitting of almost any theory [desired] to the small number of facts we have&quot;Gage acting as a &quot;Rorschach inkblot&quot; in which proponents of various conflicting theories of the brain all saw support for their views. Historically, published accounts of Gage (including scientific ones) have almost always severely exaggerated and distorted his behavioral changes, frequently contradicting the known facts.

A report of Gage&#x27;s physical and mental condition shortly before his death implies that his most serious mental changes were temporary, so that in later life he was far more functional, and socially far better adapted, than in the years immediately following his accident. A social recovery hypothesis suggests that his work as a stagecoach driver in Chile fostered this recovery by providing daily structure that allowed him to regain lost social and personal skills.

==Life==

===Background===

Gage was the first of five children born to Jesse Eaton Gage and Hannah Trussell (Swetland) Gage of Grafton County, New Hampshire. Little is known about his upbringing and education beyond that he was literate.

Physician John Martyn Harlow, who knew Gage before his accident, described him as

(In the pseudoscience of phrenology, which was then just ending its vogue, &quot;nervo-bilious&quot; denoted an unusual combination of &quot;excitable and active mental powers&quot; with &quot;energy and strength [of] mind and body [making] possible the endurance of great mental and physical labor&quot;.)

Gage may have first worked with explosives on farms as a youth, or in nearby mines and quarries. In July 1848 he was employed on construction of the Hudson River Railroad near Cortlandt Town, New York, and by September he was a blasting foreman (possibly an independent contractor) on railway construction projects. His employers&#x27; &quot;most efficient and capable foreman ... a shrewd, smart business man, very energetic and persistent in executing all his plans of operation&quot;, he had even commissioned a custom-made a large iron rodfor use in setting explosive charges.

===Accident===


On September 13, 1848, Gage was for the  south of the village of . Setting a blast entailed boring a hole deep into an of rock; adding  and a fuse; then using the tamping iron to pack (&quot;tamp&quot;) sand, clay, or other inert material into the hole above the powder in order to contain the blast&#x27;s energy and direct it into surrounding rock.

As Gage was doing this around 4:30 p.m., his attention was attracted by his men working behind him.
Looking over his right shoulder, and bringing his head into line with the blast hole and tamping iron, Gage opened his mouth to speak; in that same instant the tamping iron sparked against the rock and (possibly because the sand had been omitted) the powder exploded. Rocketed from the hole, the tamping iron in diameter, long, and weighing entered the left side of Gage&#x27;s face in an upward direction, just forward of the angle of the lower jaw. Continuing upward outside the upper jaw and possibly fracturing the cheekbone, it passed behind the left eye, through the left side of the brain, then completely out the top of the skull through the frontal bone.

Despite 19th-century references to Gage as the &quot;American Crowbar Case&quot;, his tamping iron did not have the bend or claw with the term &quot;crowbar;&quot; rather, it was simply a pointed cylinder something like a javelin, round and fairly smooth:

The tamping iron landed point-first some away, &quot;smeared with blood and brain&quot;.

Gage was thrown onto his back and gave some brief convulsions of the arms and legs, but spoke within a few minutes, walked with little assistance, and sat upright in an oxcart for the ride to his lodgings in town.
(A possibly apocryphal contemporary newspaper report claimed that Gage, while en route, made an entry in his time-bookthe record of his crew&#x27;s hours and wages.)
About 30 minutes after the accident, physician Edward H. Williams found Gage sitting in a chair outside the hotel and was greeted with &quot;one of the great understatements of medical history&quot;:

Harlow took charge of the case around 6 p.m.:

Gage was also swallowing blood, which he regurgitated every 15 or 20 minutes.

===Treatment and convalescence===
With Williams&#x27; assistance Harlow shaved the scalp around the region of the tamping iron&#x27;s exit, then removed coagulated blood, small bone fragments, and &quot;an ounce or more&quot; of protruding brain. After probing for foreign bodies and replacing two large detached pieces of bone, Harlow closed the wound with adhesive straps, leaving it partially open for drainage; the entrance wound in the cheek was bandaged only loosely, for the same reason. A wet was applied, then a nightcap, then further bandaging to secure these dressings. Harlow also dressed Gage&#x27;s hands and forearms (which along with his face had been deeply burned) and ordered that Gage&#x27;s head be kept elevated.

Late that evening Harlow noted, &quot;Mind clear. Constant agitation of his legs, being alternately retracted and extended... Says he &#x27;does not care to see his friends, as he shall be at work in a few days.

Despite his own optimism, Gage&#x27;s convalescence was long, difficult, and uneven. Though recognizing his mother and unclesummoned from Lebanon, New Hampshire, 30 miles (50km) away on the morning after the accident, on the second day he &quot;lost control of his mind, and became decidedly delirious&quot;. By the fourth day, he was again &quot;rational ... knows his friends&quot;, and after a week&#x27;s further improvement Harlow entertained, for the first time, the thought &quot;that it was &quot;possible&quot; for Gage to recover ... This improvement, however, was of short duration.&quot;


Beginning 12 days after the accident, Gage was semi-comatose, &quot;seldom speaking unless spoken to, and then answering only in monosyllables&quot;, and on the 13th day Harlow noted, &quot;Failing strength ... coma deepened; the globe of the left eye became more protuberant, with [&quot;fungus&quot;deteriorated, infected tissue] pushing out rapidly from the internal canthus [as well as] from the wounded brain, and coming out at the top of the head.&quot; By the 14th day, &quot;the exhalations from the mouth and head [are] horribly . Comatose, but will answer in monosyllables if aroused. Will not take nourishment unless strongly urged. The friends and attendants are in hourly expectancy of his death, and have his coffin and clothes in readiness. One of the attendants implored me not to do anything more for him, as it would only prolong his sufferingsthat if I would only keep away and let him alone, he would die.&quot;

Galvanized to action, Harlow &quot;cut off the fungi which were sprouting out from the top of the brain and filling the opening, and made free application of caustic [i.e. crystalline silver nitrate] to them. With a scalpel I laid open the and immediately there were discharged eight ounces [250 ml] of ill-conditioned pus, with blood, and excessively fetid.&quot; (&quot;Gage was lucky to encounter Dr. Harlow when he did&quot;, writes Barker. &quot;Few doctors in 1848 would have had the experience with cerebral abscess with which Harlow left and which probably saved Gage&#x27;s life.&quot; &quot;See § Factors favoring Gage&#x27;s survival, below.&quot;)

On the 24th day, Gage &quot;succeeded in raising himself up, and took one step to his chair&quot;. One month later, he was walking &quot;up and down stairs, and about the house, into the &quot;, and while Harlow was absent for a week Gage was &quot;in the street every day except Sunday&quot;, his desire to return to his family in New Hampshire being &quot;uncontrollable by his friends ... he went without an overcoat and with thin boots; got wet feet and a chill&quot;. He soon developed a fever, but by mid-November was &quot;feeling better in every respect [and] walking about the house again&quot;. Harlow&#x27;s prognosis at this point: Gage &quot;appears to be in a way of recovering, if he can be controlled&quot;.

By November 25 (10 weeks after his injury), Gage was strong enough to return to his parents&#x27; home in Lebanon, New Hampshire, traveling there in a &quot;close carriage&quot; (an enclosed conveyance of the kind used for transporting the insane). Though &quot;quite feeble and thin ... weak and childish&quot; on arriving, by late December he was &quot;riding out, improving both mentally and physically&quot;, and by the following February he was &quot;able to do a little work about the horses and barn, feeding the cattle etc. [and] as the time for ploughing came [i.e. about May or June] he was able to do half a day&#x27;s work after that and bore it well&quot;. In August his mother told an inquiring physician that his memory seemed somewhat impaired, though slightly enough that a stranger would not notice.

===Injuries===

In April 1849, Gage returned to Cavendish and visited Harlow, who noted at that time loss of vision, and ptosis, of the left eye, a large scar on the forehead (from Harlow&#x27;s draining of the abscess) and

Gage&#x27;s rearmost left upper molar, adjacent to the point of entry through the cheek, was also lost.
Though a year later some weakness remained, Harlow wrote that &quot;physically, the recovery was quite complete during the four years immediately succeeding the injury&quot;.

===New England and New York (18491852)===

In November 1849 Henry Jacob Bigelow, the Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, brought Gage to Boston for several weeks and, after satisfying himself that the tamping iron had actually passed through Gage&#x27;s head, presented him to a meeting of the Boston Society for Medical Improvement and (possibly) to the medical school class.

Unable to reclaim his railroad job Gage was for a time &quot;a kind of living museum exhibit&quot; at Barnum&#x27;s American Museum in New York City. (This was not the later Barnum&#x27;s circus; there is no evidence Gage ever exhibited with a troupe or circus, or on a fairground.) Advertisements have also been found for public appearances by Gagewhich he may have arranged and promoted himselfin New Hampshire and Vermont, supporting Harlow&#x27;s statement that Gage made public appearances in &quot;most of the larger New England towns&quot;. (Years later Bigelow wrote that Gage had been &quot;a shrewd and intelligent man and quite disposed to do anything of that sort to turn an honest penny&quot;, but gave up such efforts because &quot;[that] sort of thing has not much interest for the general public&quot;.)
For about 18 months, he worked for the owner of a stable and coach service in Hanover, New Hampshire.

===Chile and California (18521860)===

In August 1852, Gage was invited to Chile to work as a long-distance stagecoach driver there, &quot;caring for horses, and often driving a coach heavily laden and drawn by six horses&quot; on the ValparaísoSantiago route. After his health began to fail in mid-1859, he left Chile for San Francisco, arriving (in his mother&#x27;s words) &quot;in a feeble condition, having failed very much since he left New Hampshire ... Had many ill turns while in Valparaiso, especially during the last year, and suffered much from hardship and exposure.&quot; In San Francisco he recovered under the care of his mother and sister, who had relocated there from New Hampshire around the time he went to Chile. Then, &quot;anxious to work&quot;, he found employment with a farmer in Santa Clara.

In February 1860, Gage began to have epileptic seizures. He lost his job, and (wrote Harlow) as the seizures increased in frequency and severity he &quot;continued to work in various places [though he] could not do much&quot;.

===Death and exhumation===

On May 18, 1860, Gage &quot;left Santa Clara and went home to his mother. At 5 o&#x27;clock, A.M., on the 20th, he had a severe . The family physician was called in, and bled him. The were repeated frequently during the day and night,&quot; and he died in &quot;status&quot;, in or near San Francisco,
late on May 21, 1860. He was buried in San Francisco&#x27;s Lone Mountain Cemetery.

In 1866, Harlow (who had &quot;lost all trace of [Gage], and had well nigh abandoned all of ever hearing from him again&quot;) somehow learned that Gage had died in California, and made contact with his family there. At Harlow&#x27;s request the family had Gage&#x27;s skull exhumed, then personally delivered it to Harlow, who was by then a prominent physician, and civic leader in Woburn, Massachusetts.

About a year after the accident, Gage had given his tamping iron to Harvard Medical School&#x27;s Warren Anatomical Museum, but he later reclaimed it and made what he called &quot;my iron bar&quot; his &quot;constant companion during the remainder of his life&quot;;
now it too was delivered by Gage&#x27;s family to Harlow. (Though some accounts assert that Gage&#x27;s iron had been buried with him, there is no evidence for this.) After studying them for a triumphal 1868 retrospective paper on Gage, Harlow redeposited the ironthis time with the skullin the Warren Museum, where they remain on display today.

The tamping iron bears the following inscription, commissioned by Bigelow in conjunction with the iron&#x27;s original deposit in the Museum (though the date given for the accident is one day off):

The date &quot;Jan 6 1850&quot; falls within the period during which Gage was in Boston under Bigelow&#x27;s observation.

In 1940 Gage&#x27;s headless remains were moved to Cypress Lawn Memorial Park as part of a mandated relocation of San Francisco&#x27;s cemeteries to outside city limits .

==Mental changes and brain damage==

Gage may have been the first case to suggest the brain&#x27;s role in determining personality and that damage to specific parts of the brain might induce specific personality changes, but the nature, extent, and duration of these changes have been difficult to establish. Only a handful of sources give direct information on what Gage was like (either before or after the accident), the mental changes published after his death were much more dramatic than anything reported while he was alive, and few sources are explicit about the periods of Gage&#x27;s life to which their various descriptions of him (which vary widely in their implied level of functional impairment) are meant to apply.

===Early observations (1849–1852)===

Harlow (&quot;virtually our only source of information&quot; on Gage, according to psychologist Malcolm Macmillan) described the pre-accident Gage as hard-working, responsible, and &quot;a great favorite&quot; with the men in his charge, his employers having regarded him as &quot;the most efficient and capable foreman in their employ&quot;; he also took pains to note that Gage&#x27;s memory and general intelligence seemed unimpaired after the accident, outside of the delirium exhibited in the first few days. Nonetheless these same employers, after Gage&#x27;s accident, &quot;considered the change in his mind so marked that they could not give him his place again&quot;:

This description (&quot;now routinely quoted&quot;, says Kotowicz) is from Harlow&#x27;s observations set down soon after the accident, but Harlowperhaps hesitant to describe his patient negatively while he was still alivedelayed publishing it until 1868, after Gage had died and his family had supplied &quot;what we so much desired to see&quot; (as Harlow termed Gage&#x27;s skull).

In the interim, Harlow&#x27;s 1848 report, published just as Gage was emerging from his convalescence, merely hinted at psychological symptoms:

But after Bigelow termed Gage &quot;quite recovered in faculties of body and mind&quot; with only &quot;inconsiderable disturbance of function&quot;, a rejoinder in the &quot;American Phrenological Journal&quot;

was apparently based on information anonymously supplied by Harlow. Pointing out that Bigelow gave extensive verbatim quotations from Harlow&#x27;s 1848 papers, yet omitted Harlow&#x27;s promise to follow up with details of Gage&#x27;s &quot;mental manifestations&quot;, Barker explains Bigelow&#x27;s and Harlow&#x27;s contradictory evaluations (less than a year apart) by differences in their educational backgrounds, in particular their attitudes toward cerebral localization (the idea that different regions of the brain are specialized for different functions) and phrenology (the nineteenth-century pseudoscience that held that talents and personality can be inferred from the shape of a person&#x27;s skull):

A reluctance to ascribe a biological basis to &quot;higher mental functions&quot; (functionssuch as language, personality, and moral judgmentbeyond the merely sensory and motor) may have been a further reason Bigelow discounted the behavioral changes in Gage which Harlow had noted. 

===Later observations (18581859)===
In 1860, an American physician who had known Gage in Chile in 1858 and 1859 described him as still &quot;engaged in stage driving [and] in the enjoyment of good health, with no impairment whatever of his mental faculties&quot;. Together with the fact that Gage was hired by his employer in advance, in New England, to become part of the new coaching enterprise in Chile, this implies that Gage&#x27;s most serious mental changes had been temporary, so that the &quot;fitful, irreverent ... capricious and vacillating&quot; Gage described by Harlow immediately after the accident became, over time, far more functional and far better adapted socially.

Macmillan writes that this conclusion is reinforced by the responsibilities and challenges associated with stagecoach work such as that done by Gage in Chile, including the requirement that drivers &quot;be reliable, resourceful, and possess great endurance. But above all, they had to have the kind of personality that enabled them to get on well with their passengers.&quot; A day&#x27;s work for Gage meant &quot;a 13-hour journey over 100 miles [160km] of poor roads, often in times of political instability or frank revolution. All thisin a land to whose language and customs Phineas arrived an utter strangermilitates as much against permanent disinhibition [i.e. an inability to plan and self-regulate] as do the extremely complex sensory-motor and cognitive skills required of a coach driver.&quot; (An American visitor wrote: &quot;The departure of the coach was always a great event at Valparaisoa crowd of ever-astonished Chilenos assembling every day to witness the phenomenon of one man driving six horses.&quot;)

===Social recovery===
Macmillan writes that this contrastbetween Gage&#x27;s early, versus later, post-accident behaviorreflects his &quot;[gradual change] from the commonly portrayed impulsive and uninhibited person into one who made a reasonable &#x27;social recovery, citing persons with similar injuries for whom &quot;someone or something gave enough structure to their lives for them to relearn lost social and personal skills&quot;:

According to contemporary accounts by visitors to Chile, Gage would have had to

En route (Macmillan continues):

Thus Gage&#x27;s stagecoach work&quot;a highly structured environment in which clear sequences of tasks were required [but within which] contingencies requiring foresight and planning arose daily&quot;resembles rehabilitation regimens first developed by Soviet neuropsychologist Alexander Luria for the reestablishment of self-regulation in World War II soldiers suffering frontal lobe injuries.

A neurological basis for such recoveries may be found in emerging evidence &quot;that damaged [neural] tracts may re-establish their original connections or build alternative pathways as the brain recovers&quot; from injury. Macmillan adds that if Gage made such a recoveryif he eventually &quot;figured out how to live&quot; (as Fleischman put it) despite his injurythen it &quot;would add to current evidence that rehabilitation can be effective even in difficult and long-standing cases&quot;; and if Gage could achieve such improvement without medical supervision, &quot;what are the limits for those in formal rehabilitation programs?&quot; As author Sam Kean put it, &quot;If even Phineas Gage bounced backthat&#x27;s a powerful message of hope.&quot;

===Exaggeration and distortion of mental changes===


Macmillan&#x27;s analysis of scientific and popular accounts of Gage found that they almost always distort and exaggerate his behavioral changes well beyond anything described by anyone who had direct contact with him, concluding that the known facts are &quot;inconsistent with the common view of Gage as a boastful, brawling, foul-mouthed, dishonest useless drifter, unable to hold down a job, who died penniless in an institution&quot;. In the words of Barker, &quot;As years passed, the case took on a life of its own, accruing novel additions to Gage&#x27;s story without any factual basis&quot;. Even today (writes Zbigniew Kotowicz) &quot;Most commentators still rely on hearsay and accept what others have said about Gage, namely, that after the accident he became a psychopath&quot;; Grafman has written that &quot;the details of [Gage&#x27;s] social cognitive impairment have occasionally been inferred or even embellished to suit the enthusiasm of the story teller&quot;;
and Goldenberg calls Gage &quot;a (nearly) blank sheet upon which authors can write stories which illustrate their theories and entertain the public&quot;.

For example, Harlow&#x27;s statement that Gage &quot;continued to work in various places; could not do much, changing often, and always finding something that did not suit him in every place he tried&quot; refers only to Gage&#x27;s final months, after convulsions had set in. But it has been misinterpreted as meaning that Gage &quot;never&quot; held a regular job after his accident, &quot;was prone to quit in a capricious fit or be let go because of poor discipline&quot;, &quot;never returned to a fully independent existence&quot;, &quot;spent the rest of his life living miserably off the charity of others and traveling around the country as a sideshow freak&quot;, and (&quot;dependent on his family&quot; or &quot;in the custody of his parents&quot;) died &quot;in careless dissipation&quot;. In fact, after his initial post-recovery months spent traveling and exhibiting, Gage supported himselfat a total of just two different jobsfrom early 1851 until just before his death in 1860.

Other behaviors ascribed, by various authors, to the post-accident Gage that are either unsupported by, or in contradiction to, the known facts include the following:

None of these behaviors are mentioned by anyone who had met Gage or even his family,
and as Kotowicz put it, &quot;Harlow does not report a single act that Gage should have been ashamed of.&quot; Gage is &quot;a great story for illustrating the need to go back to original sources&quot;, writes Macmillan, most authors having been &quot;content to summarize or paraphrase accounts that are already seriously in error&quot;.

Nonetheless (write Daffner and Searl) &quot;the telling of [Gage&#x27;s] story has increased interest in understanding the enigmatic role that the frontal lobes play in behavior and personality&quot;, and Ratiu has said that in teaching about the frontal lobes, an anecdote about Gage is like an &quot;ace [up] your sleeve. It&#x27;s just like whenever you talk about the French Revolution you talk about the guillotine, because it&#x27;s so cool.&quot;
Benderly suggests that instructors use the Gage case to illustrate the importance of critical thinking.

===Extent of brain damage===



In addition, Ratiu et al. noted that the hole in the base of the cranium (created as the tamping iron passed through the sphenoidal sinus into the brain) has a diameter about half that of the iron itself; combining this with the hairline fracture beginning behind the exit region and running down the front of the skull, they concluded that the skull &quot;hinged&quot; open as the iron entered from below, then was pulled closed by the resilience of soft tissues once the iron had exited through the top of the head.

Van Horn et al. concluded that damage to Gage&#x27;s white matter (of which they made detailed estimates) was as or more significant to Gage&#x27;s mental changes than cerebral cortex (gray matter) damage. Thiebaut de Schotten et al. estimated white-matter damage in Gage and two other case studies (&quot;Tan&quot; and &quot;H.M.&quot;), concluding that these patients &quot;suggest that social behavior, language, and memory depend on the coordinated activity of different [brain] regions rather than single areas in the frontal or temporal lobes.&quot;

==Factors favoring Gage&#x27;s survival==

Harlow saw Gage&#x27;s survival as demonstrating &quot;the wonderful resources of the system in enduring the shock and in overcoming the effects of so frightful a lesion, and as a beautiful display of the recuperative powers of nature&quot;, and listed what he saw as the circumstances favoring it:
For Harlow&#x27;s description of the pre-accident Gage, see § Background, above.

Despite its very large diameter and mass (compared to a weapon-fired projectile) the tamping iron&#x27;s relatively low velocity drastically reduced the energy available to compressive and concussive &quot;shock waves&quot;.

Harlow continued:
Barker writes that &quot;[Head injuries] from falls, horse kicks, and gunfire, were well known in preCivil War America [and] every contemporary course of lectures on surgery described the diagnosis and treatment&quot; of such injuries. But to Gage&#x27;s benefit, surgeon Joseph Pancoast had performed &quot;his most celebrated operation for head injury before Harlow&#x27;s medical class, to drain the pus, resulting in temporary recovery. Unfortunately, symptoms recurred and the patient died. At autopsy, reaccumulated pus was found: granulation tissue had blocked the opening in the dura.&quot; By keeping the exit wound open, and elevating Gage&#x27;s head to encourage drainage from the cranium into the sinuses (through the hole made by the tamping iron), Harlow &quot;had not repeated Professor Pancoast&#x27;s mistake&quot;.

Finally,
Precisely what Harlow&#x27;s &quot;several reasons&quot; were is unclear, but he was likely referring, at least in part, to the understanding (slowly developing since ancient times) that injuries to the front of the brain are less dangerous than are those to the rear, because the latter frequently interrupt vital functions such as breathing and circulation. For example, surgeon James Earle wrote in 1790 that &quot;a great part of the cerebrum may be taken away without destroying the animal, or even depriving it of its faculties, whereas the cerebellum will scarcely admit the smallest injury, without being followed by mortal symptoms.&quot;

Ratiu et al. and Van Horn et al. both concluded that the tamping iron passed left of the superior sagittal sinus and left it intact, both because Harlow does not mention loss of cerebrospinal fluid through the nose, and because otherwise Gage would almost certainly have suffered fatal blood loss or air embolism.
Harlow&#x27;s moderate (in the context of medical practice of the time) use of emetics, purgatives, and (in one instance) bleeding would have &quot;produced dehydration with reduction of intracranial pressure [which] may have favorably influenced the outcome of the case&quot;, according to Steegmann.

As to his own role in Gage&#x27;s survival, Harlow merely averred, &quot;I can only say ... with good old Ambroise Paré, I him, God healed him&quot;, but Macmillan calls this self-assessment far too modest. Noting that Harlow had been a &quot;relatively inexperienced local physician ... graduated four and a half years earlier&quot;, Macmillan&#x27;s discussion of Harlow&#x27;s &quot;skillful and imaginative adaptation [of] conservative and progressive elements from the available therapies to the particular needs posed by Gage&#x27;s injuries&quot; emphasizes that Harlow &quot;did not apply rigidly what he had learned&quot;, for example forgoing an exhaustive search for bone fragments (which risked hemorrhage and further brain injury) and applying caustic to the &quot;fungi&quot; instead of excising them (which risked hemorrhage) or forcing them into the wound (which risked compressing the brain).

==Early medical attitudes==

===Skepticism===



&quot;A distinguished Professor of Surgery in a distant city&quot;, Harlow continued, had even dismissed Gage as a &quot;Yankee invention&quot;.

According to the &quot;Boston Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; (1869) it was the 1850 report on Gage by BigelowHarvard&#x27;s Professor of Surgery and &quot;a majestic and figure on the medical scene of those times&quot;that &quot;finally succeeded in forcing [the case&#x27;s] authenticity upon the credence of the as could hardly have been done by any one in whose sagacity and surgical knowledge his &quot;&quot; had any less confidence&quot;. Noting that, &quot;The leading feature of this case is its This is the sort of accident that happens in the pantomime at the theater, not elsewhere&quot;, Bigelow emphasized that though &quot;at first wholly skeptical, I have been personally convinced&quot;.

Nonetheless (Bigelow wrote just before Harlow&#x27;s 1868 presentation of Gage&#x27;s skull) though &quot;the nature of [Gage&#x27;s] injury and its &quot;reality&quot; are now &quot;beyond doubt&quot; ... Ihave received a letter within a month [purporting] to prove that ... the accident &quot;could not have happened&quot;.&quot;

===Standard for other brain injuries===

As the reality of Gage&#x27;s accident and survival gained credence, it became &quot;the standard against which other injuries to the brain were judged&quot;, and it has retained that status despite competition from a growing list of other unlikely-sounding brain-injury accidents, including encounters with axes, bolts, low bridges, exploding firearms, a revolver shot to the nose, further tamping irons, and falling Eucalyptus branches.
For example, after a miner survived traversal of his skull by a gas pipe in diameter (extracted &quot;not without considerable difficulty and force, owing to a bend in the portion of the rod in his skull&quot;), his physician invoked Gage as the &quot;only case comparable with this, in the amount of brain injury, that I have seen reported&quot;.

Often these comparisons carried hints of humor, competitiveness, or both. The &quot;Boston Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;, for example, alluded to Gage&#x27;s astonishing survival by referring to him as &quot;the patient whose cerebral organism had been comparatively so little disturbed by its abrupt and intrusive visitor&quot;; and a Kentucky doctor, reporting a patient&#x27;s survival of a gunshot through the nose, bragged, &quot;If you can send a tamping bar through a fellow&#x27;s brain and not kill him, I guess there are not many can shoot a bullet between a man&#x27;s mouth and his brains, stopping just short of the medulla oblongata, and not touch either.&quot;
Similarly, when a lumbermill foreman returned to work soon after a saw cut into his skull from just between the eyes to behind the top of his head, his surgeon (who had removed from this wound &quot;thirty-two pieces of bone, together with considerable sawdust&quot;) termed the case &quot;second to none reported, save the famous tamping-iron case of Dr. Harlow&quot;, though apologizing that &quot;I cannot well gratify the desire of my professional brethren to possess [the patient&#x27;s] skull, until he has no further use for it himself.&quot;

As these and other remarkable brain-injury survivals accumulated, the &quot;Boston Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; pretended to wonder whether the brain has any function at all: &quot;Since the antics of iron bars, gas pipes, and the like skepticism is discomfitted, and dares not utter itself. Brains do not seem to be of much account now-a-days.&quot; The &quot;Transactions of the Vermont Medical Society&quot; was similarly facetious: The times have been,&#x27; says Macbeth , &#x27;that when the brains were out the man would die. But now they rise again.&#x27; Quite possibly we shall soon hear that some German professor is it.&quot;

==Theoretical misuse==

Though Gage is considered the &quot;index case for personality change due to frontal lobe damage&quot;, the uncertain extent of his brain damage and the limited understanding of his behavioral changes render him &quot;of more historical than neurologic interest&quot;. Thus, Macmillan writes, &quot;Phineas&#x27; story is [primarily] worth remembering because it illustrates how easily a small stock of facts becomes transformed into popular and scientific myth&quot;, the paucity of evidence having allowed &quot;the fitting of almost any theory [desired] to the small number of facts we have&quot;. A similar concern was expressed as early as 1877, when British neurologist David Ferrier (writing to Harvard&#x27;s Henry Pickering Bowditch in an attempt &quot;to have this case definitely settled&quot;) complained that, &quot;In investigating reports on diseases and injuries of the brain, I am constantly being amazed at the inexactitude and distortion to which they are subject by men who have some pet theory to support. The facts suffer so frightfully ...&quot;
More recently, neurologist Oliver Sacks refers to the &quot;interpretations and misinterpretations [of Gage] from 1848 to the present&quot;,
and Jarrett discusses the use of Gage to promote &quot;the myth, found in hundreds of psychology and neuroscience textbooks, plays, films, poems, and YouTube skits[:] Personality is located in the frontal lobes... and once those are damaged, a person is changed forever.&quot;

===Cerebral localization===
In the 19th-century debate over whether the various mental functions are or are not localized in specific regions of the brain , both sides managed to enlist Gage in support of their theories. For example, after Eugene Dupuy wrote that Gage proved that the brain is not localized (characterizing him as a &quot;striking case of destruction of the so-called speech centre without consequent aphasia&quot;) Ferrier replied by using Gage (along with the woodcuts of his skull and tamping iron from Harlow&#x27;s 1868 paper) to support his thesis that the brain &quot;is&quot; localized.

===Phrenology===
Throughout the 19th century, adherents of phrenology contended that Gage&#x27;s mental changes (his profanity, for example) stemmed from destruction of his mental &quot;organ of &quot;as phrenologists saw it, the part of the brain responsible for &quot;goodness, benevolence, the gentle character ... [and] to dispose man to conduct himself in a manner conformed to the maintenance of social order&quot;and/or the adjacent &quot;organ of &quot;related to religion and God, and respect for peers and those in authority. (Phrenology held that the organs of the &quot;grosser and more animal passions are near the base of the brain; literally the lowest and nearest the animal man [while] highest and farthest from the sensual are the moral and religions feelings, as if to be nearest heaven&quot;. Thus Veneration and Benevolence are at the apex of the skullthe region of exit of Gage&#x27;s tamping iron.)

Harlow wrote that Gage, during his convalescence, did not &quot;estimate size or money accurately[,] would not take $1000 for a few pebbles&quot; and was not particular about prices when visiting a local store; by these examples Harlow may have been implying damage to phrenology&#x27;s &quot;Organ of Comparison&quot;.

===Psychosurgery and lobotomy===

It is frequently asserted that what happened to Gage played a role in the later development of various forms of psychosurgeryparticularly lobotomyor even that Gage&#x27;s accident constituted &quot;the first lobotomy&quot;. Aside from the question of why the unpleasant changes usually (if hyperbolically) attributed to Gage would inspire surgical imitation, there is no such link, according to Macmillan:

===Somatic marker hypothesis===

Antonio Damasio, in support of his &quot;somatic marker hypothesis&quot; (relating decision-making to emotions and their biological underpinnings), draws parallels between behaviors he ascribes to Gage and those of modern patients with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. But Damasio&#x27;s depiction of Gage has been severely criticized, for example by Kotowicz:

As Kihlstrom put it, &quot;[M]any modern commentators exaggerate the extent of Gage&#x27;s personality change, perhaps engaging in a kind of retrospective reconstruction based on what we now know, or think we do, about the role of the frontal cortex in self-regulation.&quot;
Macmillan gives detailed criticism of Antonio Damasio&#x27;s various presentations of Gage (some of which are joint work with Hannah Damasio and others).

==Portraits==


Two daguerreotype portraits of Gage, identified in 2009 and 2010, are the only of him known other than a plaster head cast taken for Bigelow in late 1849 (and now in the Warren Museum along with Gage&#x27;s skull and tamping iron).
The first portrait shows a &quot;disfigured yet still-handsome&quot; Gage with left eye closed and scars clearly visible, &quot;well dressed and confident, even proud&quot; and holding his iron, on which portions of its inscription can be made out. (For decades the portrait&#x27;s owners had believed that it depicted an injured whaler with his harpoon.)
The second portrait, copies of which are in the possession of two branches of the Gage family, shows Gage in a somewhat different pose, wearing the same waistcoat and possibly the same jacket, but with a different shirt and tie.

Authenticity of the portraits was confirmed by overlaying the inscription on the tamping iron, as seen in the portraits, against that on the actual tamping iron, and matching the subject&#x27;s injuries to those preserved in the head cast. However, about when, where, and by whom the portraits were taken nothing is known, except that they were created no earlier than January 1850 (when the inscription was added to the tamping iron), on different occasions, and are likely by different photographers.

The portraits support other evidence that Gage&#x27;s most serious mental changes were temporary . &quot;That [Gage] was any form of vagrant following his injury is belied by these remarkable images&quot;, wrote Van Horn et al. &quot;Although just one picture,&quot; Kean commented in reference to the first image discovered, &quot;it exploded the common image of Gage as a dirty, disheveled misfit. This Phineas was proud, well-dressed, and disarmingly handsome.&quot;

<text>Ełk is a city in northeastern Poland with 61,677 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is the seat of Ełk County in Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. It lies on the shore of Ełk Lake, which was formed by a glacier, and is surrounded by extensive forests. It is the largest city and unofficial capital of historical Masuria. One of the principal attractions in the area is legal hunting.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The area where the town of Ełk is located was originally inhabited by Jatvingians, a Baltic peoples, during the Early Middle Ages. By 1281, Skomand the last leader of the pagan Jatvingians, capitulated to the crusading Teutonic Knights, who initially were invited in 1226 by Konrad I of Masovia from the Polish Piast dynasty to put an end to the constant pagan raids into his territory.

After 1323, the northern part of the region was administered by the commandery of Brandenburg, while the larger part with the later town belonged to Balga commandery. A former Old Prussian settlement, the town was first documented in 1398 around a castle built by the Teutonic Knights. The town&#x27;s name has various postulated origins. Its German version &quot;Lyck&quot; is postulated to be derived from its Old Prussian name, &quot;Luks&quot; (from the word for waterlily, &quot;luka&quot;), while another theory holds that the name comes from Polish word &quot;łęg&quot; meaning meadow. Old Polish names of the town included &quot;Łek&quot;, &quot;Łęg&quot; and &quot;Łęk&quot;. It received its town rights in 1445.

After the outbreak of the Thirteen Years&#x27; War in 1454, the town sided with the Prussian Confederation, at whose request the Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon announced the incorporation of the region into the Kingdom of Poland, which resulted in the town becoming part of the Polish state. The town was briefly captured by the Teutonic Knights in 1455, and later on, it was conquered alternately by the Poles and the Teutonic Knights. After 1466 it was a part of Poland as a fief.

===Early modern era===
In 1537, Duke Albert of Prussia donated an estate to Jan Malecki, a Polish printer from Kraków who had either fled or moved to Ducal Prussia for material reasons, to establish a printing house. After converting to Lutheranism, Malecki translated and published Martin Luther&#x27;s
Small Catechism in Polish In 1546 the first school for secondary education in Masuria was founded in the city, where Polish nobles from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, as well as Poles and Germans from Ducal Prussia were taught in Polish; the position of a Polish teacher remained in place until 1819. Polish pastor, translator, publisher and co-creator of the literary Polish language, Hieronim Malecki, was the school&#x27;s first rector. In the mid-16th century Ełk was one of the most thriving centers of Polish-language printing. In 1600, the town&#x27;s population was Polish, and almost all innkeepers had Polish surnames. In 1639 the King of Poland Władysław IV Vasa visited the town. It remained under Polish suzerainty until 1660.

===18th and 19th centuries===
In 1709-10, the plague claimed 1,300 victims. In 1831, 300 people, about 10 percent of the populace, died of the cholera, in 1837 another 80 and 333 in 1852.

In 1825, Lyck was inhabited by 1,748 Germans and 1,394 Poles. At the beginning of the 19th century, a Polish-language school was organised in the city by Tymoteusz Gizewiusz In 1820, Fryderyk Tymoteusz Krieger became the superintendent of the school and actively defended the rights of local Poles to use the Polish language. Kireger also prepared Polish educational programs, in opposition to attempts at Germanization by Prussian authorities.

In 1840, the German-language newspaper &quot;Lycker gemeinnütziges Unterhaltungsblatt&quot;, later called &quot;Lycker Zeitung&quot;, was founded. Between 1842 and 1845, a Polish newspaper &quot;Przyjaciel Ludu Łecki&quot; (Łek&#x27;s Friend of the People) was printed in the city, whose aim was to resist Germanisation and cultivate Polish folk traditions as well as educate the local rural population.

In May 1845, a Polish resistance movement in the city was organized by Kazmierz Szulc, whose aim was to prepare local Polish youth for an uprising. During the January Uprising, weapons were smuggled through the city to the Russian Partition of Poland, and Polish insurgents fleeing the Russian Partition took refuge in the city; among others, a detachment of Colonel passed through it.

In 1885 the city, under its modern name &quot;Ełk&quot;, was named capital of Masuria by the &quot;Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland&quot;. In the late 19th century it was the largest town of the region (according to data from 1880 and 1890), before being surpassed by Osterode (Ostróda) (according to data from 1905 and 1925).

From 1896 to 1902, &quot;Gazeta Ludowa&quot;, a Polish-language newspaper, heavily subsidised by banks from Greater Poland representing the Polish national movement in Masuria, was published in the city. It soon faced repression and discrimination from the German authorities which led to its demise; its paid circulation dropped from 357 copies in 1896 to less than 250 at the turn-of-the-century. According to German-American author, Richard Blanke, the &quot;demise marked the end of the second major effort by Polish nationalists to establish a journalistic foothold in Masuria&quot;.

In 1896, Polish and Masurian activists founded the Masurian People&#x27;s Party in the city, which sought to resist efforts of German authorities at forced Germanization. The co-founder of the party was poet Michał Kajka, today honoured in Ełk with a monument in the centre of the city. From the start, the party was subject to severe repressions and attacks by Prussian authorities. In the German federal elections, the MPL received 229 votes in 1898 and 20 in 1912 in the Lyck constituency.

===20th century===

In 1910, Lyck had more than 13,000 inhabitants. Mateusz Siuchniński gives the percentage of Poles in 1900 as 35.7% but warns that the numbers come from lowered German estimates. Many citizens fled during World War I, when Imperial Russian troops attacked the region, but returned after the battles of Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes. English and Italian troops were deployed in the town after the Treaty of Versailles to supervise the East Prussian plebiscite. The plebiscite was preceded by a campaign of violence and terror by the Germans against the Poles and even against Allied soldiers. The Germans vandalized Polish information boards and held an anti-Polish rally at which they encouraged the beating of Poles and the devastation of their homes and property. In April 1920, the German &quot;Sicherheitswehr&quot; even battered Italian soldiers, two fatally. Voting under such conditions resulted in 8,339 votes for Germany and 8 for Poland, which just regained independence. In 1922, a Polish consular agency was opened, which was upgraded to a vice-consulate the next year.

It was in Lyck that the first-ever weekly newspaper in the Hebrew language, Ha-Magid (&quot;the preacher&quot;) was founded in 1856 by Eliezer Lipmann Silbermann, a local rabbi. The paper was eventually moved to Berlin. In Weimar Germany anti-Semitism became prevalent, which led to persecution of the local Jewish population even before the Nazis took power. An anti-Semitic publication, &quot;Die jüdische Überlegenheit&quot; (&quot;The Jewish Supremacy&quot;) attacking the Jews circulated in 1927 at a local gathering of fascist sympathizers In 1932, the local pharmacist Leo Frankenstein was attacked; a hand grenade was thrown into his home. The wave of anti-Semitic repressions intensified after Nazis gained power in Germany in 1933 and many local merchants and intellectuals of Jewish descent were arrested. During Kristallnacht, Jewish shops and synagogue were plundered and devastated in the town. Facing these events, several Jews of Lyck decided to escape, some abroad, some to Berlin, others as far as Shanghai Of those Jews who remained, 80 were murdered in various Nazi concentration and death camps.
The city also was the site of German prison camps for Norwegian and Soviet PoWs during World War II. Over 60 Italian PoWs were imprisoned as forced labour in the town. The Polish resistance was active and operated one of the region&#x27;s main smuggling points for Polish underground press in the city. It was heavily damaged by bombardments. The Soviet Army approached in January 1945. The city was placed under Polish administration in April 1945 and the remaining German inhabitants were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. It was rebuilt and its modern Polish name &quot;Ełk&quot; was confirmed as official.

===Contemporary times===

In 1999, Ełk was visited by Pope John Paul II. About 300,000 people attended a papal Mass.

In 2017, the anti-Muslim Ełk riots occurred after a fatal stabbing of a 21-year-old man by a Muslim kebab cook. Several hundred men surrounded the &quot;Prince Kebab&quot; restaurant, tossing firecrackers, stones, and Molotov cocktails at the shop. Police initially stood by and did not intervene for several hours; however, when they did intervene the crowd turned against them as well. Following the riots in Ełk, other attacks on kebab restaurants took place throughout Poland.

In 2018, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Poland&#x27;s independence, a monument to Józef Piłsudski was erected in front of the town hall. The Marshal of Poland was also honored with a mural on one of the townhouses in the city center.

<text>Giżycko (former or &quot;Łuczany&quot;; ; Masurian: Lec) is a town in northeastern Poland with 28,597 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is situated between Lake Kisajno and Lake Niegocin in the region of Masuria, within the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. It is the seat of Giżycko County.

Giżycko is a popular summer tourist destination due to its location within the Masurian Lake District and possesses numerous historical monuments, including a 14th-century Teutonic castle.

==History==
===Antiquity and Middle Ages===

The first known settlements in the area of today&#x27;s Giżycko were recorded in Roman times by Tacitus in his Germania and are connected to Amber Road in vicinity of which Giżycko was located. A defensive settlement of the Baltic Prussians was known to exist in the area, and in IX was recorded as being ruled by king known as Izegup or Jesegup.

After his failed attempt in 997 AD Bolesław I the Brave sent another expedition in 1008 to conquer/Christianize the Old Prussians. Just like St. Adalbert the missionary Bruno of Querfurt was killed by Sudovians near Lake Niegocin in 1009, and a memorial the Bruno – cross was erected near in 1910.

The Teutonic Knights built a castle named Lötzen (&quot;Łuczany&quot; in Polish, later also &quot;Lec&quot;) in 1340, located at the isthmus between two lakes in today&#x27;s Masuria. Lötzen was administered within the commandery of Balga. Since the Late Middle Ages, it was mainly populated by Poles from nearby Mazovia, known as Masurians.

In 1454, Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon incorporated the region to the Kingdom of Poland upon the request of the Prussian Confederation, and after the subsequent outbreak of the Thirteen Years’ War in 1454, Łuczany sided with Poland. The settlement was captured by the Teutonic Knights in 1455, but the Poles recaptured it the next year. After the peace treaty signed in Toruń in 1466 it became part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Order, until the dissolution of the Teutonic state in 1525.

===Modern era===
The settlement near the castle received town privileges, with a coat of arms and seal, in 1612, while part of the Duchy of Prussia (under Polish suzerainty until 1701). The first mayor was Paweł Rudzki. The Polish name of the town, used by its overwhelmingly Polish population, at the time was &quot;Łuczany&quot;.

Lötzen became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 and was made part of the newly established province of East Prussia in 1773. In 1709/10 the plague claimed 800 victims, only 119 inhabitants survived. In the 19th century, a new Lutheran church based on design by Karl Friedrich Schinkel was erected in the centre of the town. Lötzen became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany.

In June 1807, the Polish corps of generals Józef Zajączek and Jan Henryk Dąbrowski were stationed in the town. After the Napoleonic Wars, the town was hit by fire and famine. King Frederick William IV of Prussia, during his visit in 1845, was received in the town by 10,000 impoverished people chanting &quot;Chleba!&quot; (&quot;Bread!&quot; in Polish). The King replied to the crowd in Polish as the last Prussian ruler to speak Polish. From 1875 to 1892 the Polish-language weekly newspaper &quot;Gazeta Lecka&quot; was published.
In 1844–1848 the Boyen Fortress, a fortress named after the Prussian war-minister Hermann von Boyen, was built on a small landtongue between lake Mamry (Mauersee) and lake Niegocin (Löwentinsee). This fortress is one of the largest and best conditioned fortresses of the 19th century. In 1942–1945 it was the headquarters of the German military intelligence service (Fremde Heere Ost) under Reinhard Gehlen.

As a result of the treaty of Versailles, the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite was organized under the control of the League of Nations. During the preparations for the plebiscite, a German militia attacked a pro-Polish rally with around 1,000 people. Speakers and people attending the rally were severely beaten; the main pro-Polish leader of the rally Fryderyk Leyk was beaten so badly that he just barely survived. Afterwards the attitude of Polish population in the town was resigned and part of the population boycotted the vote while others openly voted for Germany fearing revenge; 4,900 votes were cast to remain in East Prussia, and therefore Germany, and none for Poland. Afterwards aggressive Germanisation was intensified, and during Nazi rule in Germany, there was practical ban on speaking Polish in public places in the town.

In the 1930s Lötzen was the garrison of several military units of the Wehrmacht as a Sub-area Headquarter of Wehrkreis I, which was headquartered at Königsberg. Staff-, maintenance- and guardtroops of Hitler&#x27;s headquarter Wolfsschanze and the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH, army high command) were also based in or nearby Lötzen. The OKH was based at the Mauerwald area, ca. 10 km north of Giżycko, an undestroyed bunker system.

The town was occupied by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army in 1945 during World War II and placed under Polish administration after the war ended. As part of territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union, Polish rule was accepted at the Potsdam Conference, however, on preliminary terms.

The German-speaking populace who had not been evacuated during the war were subsequently expelled westward in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The remaining Polish populace was joined by Poles displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, particularly from the Vilnius Region. The town was renamed &quot;Giżycko&quot; in 1946 in honor of the Masurian folklorist Gustaw Gizewiusz, a 19th-century Evangelical-Lutheran pastor in southern Masuria, who had greatly supported Polish language and Polish culture and stood against Germanisation of Masuria.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively part of the Suwałki Voivodeship.

==Demographics==

Up to the 19th century, the Polish population formed a majority in the city, with a small presence of Germans. By the middle of 19th century German minority became much more numerous and Germanization made rapid progress in the city.

<text>Suwałki (; ; or סוּוואַלק) is a city in northeastern Poland with a population of 69,206 (2021). It is the capital of Suwałki County and one of the most important centers of commerce in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. Suwałki is the largest city and the capital of the historical Suwałki Region. Until 1999 it was the capital of Suwałki Voivodeship. Suwałki is located about from the southwestern Lithuanian border and gives its name to the Polish protected area known as Suwałki Landscape Park. The Czarna Hańcza river flows through the city.

==Etymology==
The name derives from Lithuanian &quot;su-&quot; (near) and &quot;valka&quot; (creek, marsh), with the combined meaning &quot;place near a small river or swampy area&quot;.

==History==

The area of Suwałki had been populated by local Yotvingian and Prussian tribes since the early Middle Ages. However, with the arrival of the Teutonic Order to Yotvingia, their lands were conquered and remained largely depopulated in the following centuries.

===17th century===
The village was founded by Camaldolese monks, who in 1667 were granted the area surrounding the future town by the Grand Duke of Lithuania and the King of Poland John II Casimir. Soon afterwards the monastic order built its headquarters in Wigry, where a monastery and a church were built.

The new owners of the area started rapid economic exploitation and development of the forests; they brought enough settlers (mainly from an overpopulated Masovia) to build several new villages in the area. Also, production of wood, lumber, tar and iron ore was started. The village was first mentioned in 1688; two years later it was reported to have just two houses.

===18th century===

However, the growth of the village was fast and by 1700 it was split into Lesser and Greater Suwałki. The village was located almost exactly in the center of Camaldolese estates and lay on the main trade route linking Grodno and Merkinė with Königsberg.

In 1710 King Augustus II the Strong granted the village a privilege to organize fairs and markets. Five years later, in 1715, the village was granted town rights by the grand master of the order, Ildefons. The town was divided into 300 lots for future houses and its inhabitants were granted civil rights and exempted from taxes for seven years. In addition, the town was granted of forest that was to be turned into arable land. On May 2, 1720, the town rights were approved by King August II, and the town was allowed to organize one fair a week and four markets a year. In addition, a coat of arms was approved, depicting Saint Roch and Saint Romuald.

After the Partitions of Poland in 1795, the area was annexed by Prussia. In 1796 the monastery in Wigry was dissolved and its property confiscated by the Prussian government. The following year a seat of local &quot;powiat&quot; authorities was moved to the town, as well as a military garrison. By the end of the 18th century, Suwałki had 1,184 inhabitants and 216 houses. A large part of the population was Jewish.

===19th century===

In 1807 Suwałki became a salient of the newly formed Duchy of Warsaw and one of the centres of the Łomża Department. After the defeat of Napoleon I and the Congress of Vienna, the area was incorporated into the Congress Poland (&quot;Russian Poland&quot;), as a part of the Russian Empire (Russian partition). The status of a &quot;powiat&quot; capital was briefly withdrawn, but it was reintroduced on January 16, 1816, when the Augustów Voivodeship was created and its government was gradually moved to Suwałki. Soon afterwards the older town hall was demolished and replaced with a new one, and General Józef Zajączek financed the paving of most of the town&#x27;s streets. The cemetery was moved to the outskirts from the town centre, and that area became a town park. Also, the Russian authorities built the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway, which added to the town&#x27;s prosperity.

In 1820 a new church was built. In 1821 the first synagogue was opened. In 1829 a permanent post office was opened in Suwałki. Between 1806 and 1827 the town&#x27;s population almost tripled and reached 3,753 people living in 357 houses. During the November Uprising of 1831, the town&#x27;s population took part in the struggles against Russia, but the town was pacified by the Russian army on February 11, 1830. In 1835 the government of Tsar Nicholas I decided not to move the capital of the voivodeship to Augustów. Two years later the Voivodeships of Poland were re-designated as gubernias, and the town became the capital of the Augustów Gubernia.
In 1826 the Russians passed an investment plan and authorities initiated the construction of new public buildings. In 1835 a police station was built, in 1844 a new town hall and Orthodox and Protestant churches were completed. Soon afterwards a new marketplace was opened, as well as St. Peter&#x27;s and Paul&#x27;s hospital and a gymnasium. In addition, between 1840 and 1849 the main Catholic church was refurbished by many of Poland&#x27;s most notable architects of the era, including Piotr Aigner, Antonio Corazzi and Enrico Marconi. To change the town&#x27;s architecture and break with its rural past, in 1847 the town council passed a decree banning the construction of new wooden houses.
The town&#x27;s population continued to grow rapidly. In 1857 it had 11,273 inhabitants and in 1872 almost 20,000. Newly built factories needed workers and these were brought from workers recruited widely in Europe. The mixed Polish-Jewish-Lithuanian population was soon joined by people of almost all denominations that worshipped in the Russian Empire.

Soon Suwałki became the fourth-most populous town in Congress Poland. After the January Uprising of 1863, administration reform was passed to unify the Polish lands with Russia completely. In 1866 the &quot;gubernia&quot; of Augustów was renamed to &quot;Suwałki Gubernia&quot;. However, the route of the newly built Saint Petersburg-Warsaw railway bypassed Suwałki, adversely affecting its prosperity. It was not until the early 20th century that the establishment of a new Russian army garrison revived the economy. Also, a railway line linking Suwałki with Grodno was finally completed.

===20th century to present===
After the spring of 1905, when the Russians were forced to accept a limited liberalization, the period of Polish cultural revival started. Although the Polish language was still banned from official use, new Polish schools were opened, as well as a Polish-language &quot;Tygodnik Suwalski&quot; weekly and a library. After World War I broke out, heavy fights for the area erupted. Finally in 1915, the Germans broke the Russian front and Suwałki was under German occupation. The town and surrounding areas were detached from the rest of the Polish lands and were directly administered by the German military commander of the Ober-Ost Army. Severe laws imposed by the German military command and the tragic economic situation of the civilians led to the creation of various secret social organisations. Finally, in 1917, local branches of the Polska Organizacja Wojskowa were created.

After the collapse of the Central Powers in November 1918, the local commander of the Ober-Ost signed an agreement with the Temporary Council of the Suwałki Region and &quot;de facto&quot; allowed for the region to be incorporated into Poland. However, the German army remained in the area and continued its economic exploitation. In February 1919 the local inhabitants took part in the first free elections to the Polish Sejm, but soon afterwards the German commanders changed their mind. They expelled the Polish military units from the area and in May passed the territory to Lithuanian authority.

====Independent Poland====
By the end of July 1919, the Paris Peace Conference granted the town to Poland. As the newly-established border was disapproved of by the Polish government, it organised the Sejny Uprising on August 23, 1919. The Polish-Lithuanian War erupted and for several days fighting for control over Suwałki, Sejny and other towns in the area took place. The war ended on the insistence of the Entente in mid-September. Negotiations took place in Suwałki in early October. During the Polish-Bolshevik War, the town was captured by the Communists and, after the Battle of Warsaw, it was again passed to the Lithuanians. It was retaken by the Polish Army.

In the inter-war period, Suwałki became an autonomous town within the Białystok Voivodeship (1919-1939). This resulted in another period of prosperity, with the town&#x27;s population rising from 16,780 in 1921 to almost 25,000 in 1935. The main source of income shifted from agriculture to trade and commerce. Also, in 1931 the new water works and a power plant were built. Also, Suwałki continued to serve as one of the biggest garrisons in Poland, with two regiments of the Polish 29th Infantry Division and almost an entire Suwałki Cavalry Brigade stationed there. Beginning in 1928, Suwałki was established as the headquarters of one of the battalions of the Border Defence Corps.

====Second World War====

During the later stages of the Polish Defensive War of 1939, the town was briefly captured by the Red Army. However, on October 12 of the same year, the Soviets withdrew and transferred the area to the Germans, in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The city was renamed &quot;Sudauen&quot; and annexed directly into Nazi Germany&#x27;s province of East Prussia. Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles as part of &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; in the fall of 1939 and spring of 1940. Arrested Poles were deported to a transit camp in Działdowo or murdered on the spot. Nazi German severe laws and terrorism led to the creation of several resistance organisations in response. Although most initially destroyed by the Gestapo, by 1942 the area had one of the strongest ZWZ and AK networks. In the Szwajcaria district there are mass graves of members of the Polish resistance movement murdered by the Germans on April 26, 1940 and April 1, 1944.
Despite the resistance, almost all of the town&#x27;s once 7,000-strong Jewish community was deported and murdered, beginning in December 1939, when German troops brought the elderly, sick, and disabled into a nearby forest and machine-gunned them en masse. The Germans, with help from local collaborators, deported the community&#x27;s surviving Jews to ghettos in other towns. Nearly all either perished there or were murdered in Nazi concentration camps. The occupying Germans also systematically destroyed all traces of Jewish history and culture in the town, demolishing synagogues and desecrating Suwałki&#x27;s Jewish cemetery, where a memorial and wall of gravestone fragments stand today. Also, in Suwałki&#x27;s suburb of Krzywólka, the Germans established the Stalag I-F POW camp for almost 120,000 Soviet prisoners of war.

On October 23, 1944, the town was captured by the forces of the Soviet 3rd Belarusian Front. The fights for the town and its environs lasted for several days and took the lives of almost 5,000 Soviet soldiers before they defeated the Germans. The anti-Soviet resistance of former Armia Krajowa members lasted in the forests surrounding the town until the early 1950s.

Suwałki did not suffer much damage during World War II, most of the historic buildings survived the war, and the damage to the city was estimated at only 5-10%, which was quickly rebuilt.

====Polish People&#x27;s Republic====
The apparatus subordinate to the Polish Committee of National Liberation took power in Suwałki without major problems. Immediately after the city&#x27;s liberation by units of the Red Army, on October 23, 1944, Stanisław Łapot, a member of the former Communist Party of Poland, one of the organizers of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party in Białystok, came from Sejny to Suwałki. He was accompanied by several officials previously organized in Sejny with the deputy head Edmund Przybylski, as well as Tadeusz Sobolewski - the president of the interim Powiat Council. On the same day, at Mickiewicz Square, supposedly spontaneously organized, so with the participation of new authorities and over five thousand inhabitants of the city, and then in the &quot;Rusałka&quot; cinema hall a meeting of representatives of the population with the envoys of the Polish Committee of National Rebirth. Actions aimed at organizing the Suwałki authorities were taken shortly after the liberation. The Starosta handed over the power in the city to the temporary mayor Tadeusz Sobolewski on October 24, 1944. The commissariat of Suwałki was established. In turn, on November 7, a conference of representatives of provincial authorities with local authorities was held. As agreed, the first meeting of the Suwałki City Council took place the next day. On November 20, 1944, the board decided to locate its office in a private, Jewish building, partly abandoned, at 62/64 Kościuszki street, as the town hall building was severely damaged. In December 1944, the City Board did not gather, and its functions were performed by Sobolewski.

The transitional state in the organization and functioning of the Suwałki authorities was properly completed in January 1945. Most probably then or at the beginning of February, the staroste S. Łapot issued an oral but very important order to subordinate Suwałki to the administration of the poviat level. In this way, he deprived them of the status they had until September 1939, a city separated from the poviat municipal association. Over the next few years, this matter was dealt with by various authorities, from municipal to central. This controversial problem appeared on March 27, 1945, on the initiative of the mayor Sobolewski, at the third meeting of the City National Council. The governor Wacław Kraśko, who was present at it, was rather reluctant to propose separating the city from the poviat and pointed to the need to improve, first and foremost, the situation and condition of municipal enterprises. The Council decided to postpone the case.

Another politician calling for restoring Suwałki to the legal status of before September 1, 1939 was mayor Wacław Rudzki. At the Municipal National Council meeting on March 25, 1946, he submitted the first motion to separate the city from the poviat, which was motivated by prestigious, historical and financial considerations. The Council shared the submitted arguments and decided, through the Poviat National Council, to apply to the Voivodeship National Council in Bialystok with a request to include the city separated from poviat self-government associations. Much more radical decisions, undoubtedly also under the influence of W. Rudzki, MRN made at its meeting on May 27, 1946. She decided that the rescript of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of December 1919 about the separation of Suwałki from the poviat remains in force, therefore she is the council of the separated city and reports to the Provincial National Council in Bialystok. The Council also elected, without discussion and by acclamation, the incumbent mayor of the city, Rudzki.

After this revolt, the reaction of the superior authorities was swift. Already in mid-June 1946, the voivode demanded that the chairman of the Suwałki Poviat Department (starosta) suspend the implementation of the Municipal National Council resolutions of 27 May, while informing that in the matter of restoring Suwałki&#x27;s rights as a separate city, he turned to the Ministry of Public Administration. And indeed the voivode, writing favorably about Suwałki, their development and the achievements of the authorities, mainly Rudzki, asked the ministry for guidelines and a suggestion of a positive resolution of the case, although the relevant regulations did not allow it, mainly because the number of inhabitants of the city did not reach 25,000. After the lapse of the month, Rudzki not only did not become president, but also resigned from the position of mayor. Nevertheless, on July 25, 1946, the MRN decided to send a delegation of councilors composed of Leon Bracławski, Józef Wiszniewski and Antoni Zalewski to the Ministry of the Interior to support current activities and accelerate the restoration of Suwałki&#x27;s rights of a separated city.

Following the end of the war and the establishment of a communist regime, the new authorities of Poland began establishing territorial branches of the security services, most notably the Ministry of Public Security, in the whole country and in Suwałki as well: The seat of the PUBP was located at 5 Kościuszki street in 1944, and at the same year it was transferred to building no. 78 in the same street where it was located up until 1956.

After the war, Suwałki was retained as the capital of the &quot;powiat&quot;. However, the heavily damaged town recovered very slowly, and the Communist economic system could not support the reinvestment needed. In 1975 new administrative reform was implemented: Suwałki was designated as the capital of a separate Suwałki Voivodeship. The number of inhabitants rose rapidly, and by the end of the 1970s, the population was over 36,000. Large factories were built in the town, and it became one of the important industrial and commercial centres of Eastern Poland.

====Martial law====
During the period of martial law in Poland and rise of Solidarność in the early 1980s, Solidarność demanded that the buildings of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party and the Citizens&#x27; Militia be handed over to be used for social infrastructure, primarily schools, kindergartens and hospitals. This position was taken by the Inter-Enterprise Founding Committee of the Solidarity Independent Trade Union in Giżycko and Suwałki in regards to the party complex in 83 Noniewicza street. The first round of talks on this matter with representatives of authorities (including central authorities) took place on January 28, 1981. Solidarność emphasized that the new buildings could be turned into medical clinics, a community center for youth and a music school. It strengthened its position with over 18 thousand signatures from the inhabitants of the region. No agreement was reached, because the authorities did not want to hand over the building. Before the next round of talks on the night of February 14–15, under the cover of the Citizens&#x27; Militia and Security Service, the PZPR KW was moved to new buildings. This action caused widespread indignation in the whole province, not only among the members of Solidarity.

Following the end of Communist rule in 1989, Suwałki had a difficult period in transitioning to a new economic system. Most of the town&#x27;s major factories were inefficient and went bankrupt. Creation of the Suwałki Special Economic Zone and the proximity of the Russian and Lithuanian borders opened new possibilities for local trade and commerce. In addition, the region began to attract many tourists from all around the world. In the 21st century, residents of Suwałki frequently travel across the Russian and Lithuanian borders for shopping trips as well as to make use of the various attractions both countries offer.

To the military planners of NATO, an area of the Lithuania–Poland border area is known as the Suwałki Gap because it represents a military difficulty. It is a flat narrow piece of land, a gap, that is between Belarus and Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad exclave and that connects the three NATO-member Baltic States to Poland and the rest of NATO.

==Demographics==
==Climate==
Suwałki has a climate that is characterised by changeable weather patterns. The city has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;) and, relatively to the rest of Poland, the city&#x27;s climate has markedly continental characteristics even though there is some moderation from the Baltic Sea. Suwałki has among the greatest record temperature amplitudes in Poland: the lowest temperature was recorded on 12 January 1950 (), while the highest was , on 11 July 1946. It also holds the record for the highest atmospheric pressure ever registered in the country, at on 23 January 1907.

The weather changes are common due to the fact that, like in the rest of Poland, weather fronts generated by low-pressure areas come along frequently. Due to its northerly location and the relatively little moderation of the Baltic, the growing season around the city is the shortest in Poland; according to the data from 1995-2019, the period of sustained average daily temperatures exceeding was only 200 days long, about 20–30 days shorter than in central and southern Poland. Suwałki is often called the &quot;Polish pole of cold&quot; (&quot;polski biegun zimna&quot;) because it has the lowest average temperature of the major cities in Poland, excepting mountainous areas (the actual &quot;pole of cold&quot; is located about north of the city, in the village of Wiżajny).

Winters are just cold enough, if the isotherm is accepted, not to be classified as oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;). The skies are often overcast and snow is frequent in the season, but there is much less precipitation in the winter months than in the sunnier summer months. Nights with temperatures below sometimes occur, and temperatures below are not unheard of. According to the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW), the snow stays there for the longest time in non-mountainous areas of Poland. The city is so cold that before 2015, Suwałki was only one of the four cities in Poland to have experienced winter conditions in every period from December to February (defined as the daily mean temperature of the month going below ); the extremely anomalous winter of 2019/2020 was the first in which Suwałki did not experience such conditions.

Summers are pleasant, warm and often sunny, with the maximum daily temperatures sometimes exceeding , though the season is still somewhat cooler in the city, as compared to the rest of Poland.

<text>Augustów ( formerly known in English as &quot;Augustovo&quot; or &quot;Augustowo&quot;) is a town in north-eastern Poland. It lies on the Netta River and the Augustów Canal. It is the seat of Augustów County and of Gmina Augustów in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. Augustów has an area of , and as of June 2022 it has a population of 29,305.

In 1970, Augustów became officially recognized as a health and relaxation resort. In 1973, surrounding settlements were named a part of it, forming a popular resort town.

==History==

A settlement in the area was first mentioned in 1496. Augustów was established around 1540 by Bona Sforza and granted Magdeburg rights in 1557 by Sigismund II Augustus, after whom it was also named. It was laid out in a very regular manner, with a spacious market-place.

Until 1569 Augustów belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1569 it became part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, while its cemetery was left in the Grand Duchy, both countries formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as a result of the Union of Lublin. Augustów was a royal city, located in the Podlaskie Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. Tatar invaders destroyed Augustów in 1656, and the second half of the 17th century saw the town afflicted by plague. The 4th Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in Augustów in 1790.

In 1795 Prussia annexed Augustów in the Third Partition of Poland. In 1807, it became part of the Duchy of Warsaw, followed by incorporation into the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland in 1815. It was made a county seat in 1842. The local populace took part in the large Polish January Uprising of 1863–1864 against Russia. Following Russia&#x27;s full annexation of the Polish kingdom in the 1860s, it was administered from Suwałki. With a population around 9400 , it carried a large trade in cattle and horses, and manufactured linen and huckaback. Its canal connects the Vistula and Neman rivers and the railway reached the town in 1899, when its population was around 12,800.

During World War I, the Russian Army successfully counterattacked the German Army in the Battle of Augustów, in the lead-up to the better-known Battle of the Vistula River. In the aftermath of World War I, it was a site of fighting during the Battle of Augustów in 1920. 

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Augustów was occupied by the Soviet Union until 1941. Many inhabitants were sent to exile in Kazakhstan, from where some were able to return after 6 years. On June 22, 1941, just before the Germans captured the town, the Soviets murdered around 30–34 Polish prisoners in Augustów as part of the NKVD prisoner massacres. The Nazi German forces occupied Augustów until 1944, and operated a forced labour camp in the town. World War II brought the destruction of about 70% of the town and death or departure of most of its residents, amongst them a community of several thousand Jews who were imprisoned in the ghetto situated between the canal and the river. The Germans executed practically all of them before they left. In 1945 the Soviets conducted the nearby Augustów roundup – a special operation against former Armia Krajowa anticommunist fighters. They are presumed to have been executed and buried in an unknown location in present-day Russia or Belarus. Polish Institute of National Remembrance has declared the 1945 Augustów roundup &quot;the largest crime committed by the Soviets on Polish lands after World War II&quot;.

After the war, the recreational base of the city was further expanded. In 1946, the city had 7.2 thousand inhabitants. In 1954, several rural settlements were excluded from the city area, but in 1973, the city expanded to include several villages, forests and six lakes. In the years 1975–1998, the city was located in the Suwałki Voivodeship. In 1999, the city became part of newly created Podlaskie Voivodeship, and the seat of the Augustów district and the Augustów urban gmina.

<text>Kamienna Góra (, ) is a town in south-western Poland with 18,235 inhabitants (2023). It is the seat of Kamienna Góra County, and also of the rural district called Gmina Kamienna Góra, although it is not part of the territory of the latter (the town forms a separate urban gmina).

Kamienna Góra on the Bóbr river is situated in Lower Silesian Voivodeship between the Stone Mountains and the Rudawy Janowickie at the old trade route from Silesia to Prague, today part of the National Road No. 5. It lies approximately south-west of the regional capital Wrocław.

==History==

The area was part of the Great Moravian Empire in the Early Middle Ages, and became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century under its first ruler Mieszko I of Poland. During the times of the fragmentation of Poland it was part of the duchies of Silesia, Legnica, Jawor and Świdnica. In the early 13th century, Polish Duke Henry the Bearded erected a defensive castle at the site, due to its proximity to the Polish–Czech border. The settlement was mentioned in documents from 1232 (as &quot;Landeshut&quot;) and 1249 (as &quot;Landishute&quot; and &quot;Landishute forensis auch Camena Gora&quot;). In 1254 the Piast Duke Bolesław II the Bald of Legnica gave the area to the Benedictine monastery of Opatovice (in eastern Bohemia), who already had established the Krzeszów Abbey at nearby Krzeszów. When the abbey passed to the Cistercians in 1289, Kamienna Góra was acquired by Duke Bolko I the Strict of Świdnica, who extended it as a stronghold against the nearby Kingdom of Bohemia and granted town rights in 1292. In 1295, Poles repelled a Bohemian invasion, and Bolko I declared he would not allow any Bohemian or German ruler in Silesia. Kamienna Góra received new privileges from Duke Bolko II the Small in 1334. In 1345 the heavily fortified town was captured by the Bohemians, probably by digging an underground tunnel. In 1348 it was recaptured by the Poles, probably by using a ruse modeled on the Trojan Horse. Carts with hidden soldiers, supposedly filled with hay or other goods, were reportedly used. Nevertheless, the duchy fell to the Bohemian crown with Bolko&#x27;s death in 1368. It burnt down during the 1426 Hussite campaign to Silesia and in the 1460s it passed to the Kingdom of Hungary, before in 1490 it fell back to Bohemia, then under the rule of Vladislaus II, who erected new town walls.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the town was plundered by Austrian and Swedish troops. As a result of the war, only two residents remained in the town in 1639. After Frederick II of Prussia had conquered Silesia with &quot;Landeshut&quot; in 1742, it was the site of 12 battles during the Silesian Wars. The two largest were fought on 22 May 1745 and 23 June 1760. In the former Prussians defeated Austrian, Hungarian and Croatian forces, and in the latter Austrians defeated a Prussian corps.

From 1871 the town formed part of Germany. The town was not destroyed during World War I and II. With the rise of Nazism among the Germans, a local branch of the NSDAP was established in 1929, and soon five Nazis became town councilors. In 1934, a local branch of the Hitler Youth was established. The town&#x27;s mayor, Günther Ries, supported the Nazis and provided funding for the Hitler Youth. The Nazis held three party ceremonies in the town, on 22 June 1935, 9 November 1937 and 2 March 1939. During &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in 1938, the Germans destroyed a synagogue and four Jewish stores.

During World War II, the Germans established and operated a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Around 1,600 men, mostly Poles, and also smaller groups of other ethnicities, were imprisoned and used as forced labour in the subcamp, and many of them died. There was also a forced labour camp for Jews. It was captured by the Soviets on 9 May 1945, and after the war it became again part of Poland.

A time of insecurity began for the German townspeople, who were outlawed, repeately drived out of their homes, and had to wear white armbands. Between May 8 and May 24, almost all population of the town and the county was deported to Allied-occupied Germany, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The town was repopulated by Poles, expellees from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and settlers from central Poland. Initially renamed to the 19th-century Polish name &quot;Kamieniogóra&quot;, in 1946 the name &quot;Kamienna Góra&quot;, which was first recorded in 1249, was adopted.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Jelenia Góra Voivodeship.

<text>Lubań (; ), sometimes called Lubań Śląski (; , ); is a town in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship in southwest Poland. It is the administrative seat of Lubań County and also of the smaller Gmina Lubań (although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town is a separate urban gmina in its own right).

==Geography==
Situated north of the Jizera Mountains on the western shore of the Kwisa River, Lubań is considered part of the historic Upper Lusatia region, although it was more closely associated with Lower Silesia in the early 14th century and from 1815. It is located about east of Zgorzelec/Görlitz and about northwest of Jelenia Góra.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The town probably is at the site of a small settlement established by the West Slavic Bieżuńczanie tribe, one of the old Polish tribes, in the 9th and 10th century. Bieżuńczanie together with the Sorbian Milceni tribe, with whom they bordered in the west, were subjugated in 990 by the Margraviate of Meissen. From 1002 to 1031, the area was part of Piast-ruled Poland. In 1156, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa vested his ally, the Přemyslid duke Vladislaus II of Bohemia with the territory around Bautzen (&quot;Budissin&quot;), then called &quot;Milsko&quot;, and after the 15th century called &quot;Upper Lusatia&quot;.

Luban was granted town rights with Magdeburg rights in the course of the German Ostsiedlung. It was first mentioned in 1268. Like several other town foundings under the rule of the Přemyslid dynasty, owing to its favourable location on the historic Via Regia trade route close to the border with the Duchy of Silesia, Luban expanded rapidly. Since about 1253, Upper Lusatia temporarily had been under the rule of the Ascanian margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg. By the end of the 13th century, Luban&#x27;s first brewery was founded by the Franciscans and cloth production flourished thanks to Flemish settlers. In 1297, a clothiers&#x27; uprising took place, which was brutally suppressed. Its two leaders were beheaded at the market square.

In 1319, the town became part of the Duchy of Jawor, the southwesternmost duchy of fragmented Piast-dynasty Poland. Duke Henry I of Jawor built a new town hall, the ruins of which can be seen today (Kramarska Tower). In 1320, he founded a Magdalene monastery in Lubań. He appointed a separate wójt for the town, which to that point administratively was subordinate to the wójt of Zgorzelec. The centre of the medieval town was a square marketplace with perpendicular streets, leading to four gates: Görlitzer Tor (&quot;Zgorzelecka&quot;) to the west, Brüdertor (&quot;Bracka&quot;), built in 1318 together with stone curtains by Duke Henry of Jawor, to the south, Nikolaitor (&quot;Mikołajska&quot;) to the east and Naumburger Tor (&quot;Nowogrodziecka&quot;) to the north. The first mayor of the town was Nikolaus Hermann, and Luban received its own seal.

In 1346, the town passed to the Bohemian Crown. Under the rule of Bohemian king Charles IV of Luxembourg, Luban on 10 August 1346 established the Lusatian League, together with the towns of Budissin (), Görlitz (&#x27;), Kamenz (&#x27;), Löbau (&#x27;) and Zittau (&#x27;). Twice however, in 1427 and 1431, the Hussites completely demolished the town; it was quickly rebuilt. In its history, the town has repeatedly suffered great fires, which often ruined the whole town. Many inhabitants died as a result of plagues. In 1437, Bohemian King Sigismund exempted the town from taxes for 15 years.

In 1469, Luban became part of Hungary. In 1490, it became again part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, now ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty, and after 1526 by the House of Habsburg. In 1498, Bohemian King Vladislaus II established an annual eight-day fair. In the 15th and 16th century, brewing prospered, with local beer being popular throughout Lusatia and Silesia, it was even served in the famous Piwnica Świdnicka in Breslau (Wrocław).

===Modern era===
In 1628, Bohemian military leader Albrecht von Wallenstein visited the town. With the 1635 Peace of Prague, the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II in his capacity as Bohemian king passed Lusatia with the town to the Electorate of Saxony. As a result of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the local economy collapsed, and in 1659, 1670 and 1696 the town was hit by fires.

Residents celebrated the election of Augustus II the Strong as king of Poland and the formation of the Polish-Saxon union in 1697. During August II&#x27;s visit to the town just before his royal coronation, a parade of the town&#x27;s self-defense troops was held. With the union came prosperity. The town prospered due to linen and cloth production as well as trade in Polish oxen. During his rule, the &quot;Dom pod Okrętem&quot; (&quot;House under the Ship&quot;) was built. August II visited the town once again in 1721. The 1733 royal election of his son August III of Poland was celebrated even more grandly, with five parades of municipal self-defense troops taking place.

Following the Napoleonic wars, in 1815 the Lusatian territory around Lauban and Görlitz fell to the Kingdom of Prussia after the Vienna Congress and was incorporated into the Province of Silesia. In 1865 and 1866, Lauban obtained railway connections with Görlitz and Hirschberg (Jelenia Góra). Following the unification of Germany in 1871, the town became part of the German Empire.

===20th century===
During World War I, Lauban was the site of a large prisoner-of-war camp, whose first prisoners, from September 1914, were soldiers of Imperial Russia, including Poles and Georgians conscripted into the Russian army (large parts of Polish and Georgian lands were under Russian rule before regaining independence by both countries in 1918). From 1915, French soldiers as well as political prisoners and common criminals were also imprisoned there. Aleksandra Szczerbińska, the future wife of the leader of interwar Poland Józef Piłsudski, was imprisoned there in 1916. Józef Piłsudski and Aleksandra Piłsudska are today commemorated in Lubań with a memorial stone. During World War II, the Nazis created numerous forced labor camps in the town, the largest of which was &quot;Wohnheimlager GEMA&quot;, in which Polish and Russian women were imprisoned. Polish and Russian women were imprisoned also in other camps, as well as Russians, Hungarians, Frenchmen, Latvians and Ukrainians. The present-day district of Księginki was the location of the E231 labor subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs.

Lauban was the site of one of the last Nazi German victories in World War II. After it was taken in the Upper Silesian Offensive by the Red Army on 16 February 1945, the Wehrmacht successfully retook the town in a counterattack on 8 March 1945. After the war, the town became again part of Poland in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and was renamed to its historic Polish name &quot;Lubań&quot;. In 1945–46, the remaining German inhabitants were expelled, also in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, and the town was repopulated by Poles, including expellees from former eastern Poland, which was annexed by the Soviet Union. In the 1950s Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in the town and its vicinity.

From 1975 to 1998 it was part of the former Jelenia Góra Voivodeship. Between 1992 and 2004, the marketplace was renovated. Streets were paved and town houses around the Kramarska Tower were rebuilt.

<text>Bolesławiec ( , ) is a historic city situated on the Bóbr River in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the administrative seat of Bolesławiec County, and of Gmina Bolesławiec (being an urban gmina in its own right). As of June 2021, it has a population of 38,280. Founded in the 13th century, the city is known for its long-standing pottery-making tradition and heritage Old Town.

== Etymology ==

The name Bolesławiec is a patronymic name derived from the Slavic name Bolesław, composed of two elements of the old Polish, currently unused term bole(j) meaning very and sław meaning fame. This name literally means &quot;very famous&quot; and was given to the city in honor of the founder Bolesław I the Tall, who founded the city around 1190, granting it numerous privileges. In his list of place names in Silesia, published in Wrocław in 1888, Heinrich Adamy mentions the name of the city recorded in a document from 1196 - Boleslawez, giving its meaning Stadt des Boleslaw I (Polish: City of Bolesław I).

The town, under the Latinized name castrum Boleslavec, is mentioned in a Latin document from 1277 signed by the Polish prince Bolesław (Latin: Boleslaus dux Polonie). In 1295, in the Latin chronicle Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis, the town was mentioned under the Latinized name &quot;Boleslavia&quot; and &quot;Boleslawetz, Bolezlavitz&quot;.

The name of the town in the Latinized form Boleslavicz is mentioned in a Latin document from 1312 issued in Głogów. In a medieval document written in Latin from October 31, 1310, the city is mentioned under the Latinized name Boleslauia. In 1475, in the Latin statutes Statuta Synodalia Episcoporum Wratislaviensium, the town was mentioned under the Latinized name Boleslauia. In 1613, the Silesian regionalist and historian Mikołaj Henel from Prudnik mentioned the town in his work on the geography of Silesia entitled Silesiographia giving its Latin name: Boleslavia.

The German name Bunzlau, which has been present since the 13th century, is a Germanized form derived from the Polish name. In the work of the Swiss geographer Matthäus Merian entitled &quot;Topographia Bohemiae, Moraviae et Silesiae&quot; from 1650 mentions the city under the name Boleslau.

In 1750, the Polish name Bolesławiec was mentioned in Polish by Frederick II among other Silesian cities in an official ordinance issued for the inhabitants of Silesia. The name of the city as Bolesław was mentioned by the Silesian writer Józef Lompa in the book &quot;A short sketch of the jeography of Silesia for initial science&quot; published in Głogówek in 1847. The Polish name Bolesławiec and the German name Bunzlau were mentioned in 1896 by the Silesian writer Konstanty Damrot in a book on local names in Silesia. In his book, Damrot also mentions older names from Latin documents: 1377 - Boleslawcze, 1417 - Boleslawicz, 1446 - Boleslavice.

The Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland gives two names of the town: the Polish name Bolesławiec and the German Bunzlau.

The current name was officially approved in 1946.

==History==

=== Palaeolithic era (c. 10,000 - c. 8300 BC) ===
The oldest traces of human habitation in the Bolesławiec area date from the younger phase of the Late Palaeolithic, i.e. around 10 000 BC. In 1974, on the high terrace of the Bóbr River in Bobrowice near Szprotawa, flint tools from this period were found (a Lyngby type leaf with two fragments of splinters). At the same time, in Golnice near Bolesławiec, also on the terrace of a tributary of the Bóbr River, similar wares were discovered (an asymmetrical thylakus with a retouched base and two large scale fragments of splinters). The location of the finds is closely related to the mountainous character of the Bóbr. The valley of this river, 500 to 3,500 m wide, was under water in the spring and during continuous rainfall. The groundwater level meant that it drained slowly. As a result, the valley was difficult to access for a long time. For their own safety, late Palaeolithic man therefore stayed in the area in areas that protected him from the water element.

=== Mesolithic era (c. 8300 - c. 4500 BC) ===
In the Beaver basin, 45 sites dating to the Mesolithic era have been discovered, from Bolesławiec to Krosno Odrzańskie. All of them, as in the Palaeolithic, are situated at the edges of valleys, on higher terraces or dunes, mainly on the southern or south-western side. The finds discovered are encampments ranging in size from 2-3 acres to 1 ha (in this case it would have been several small functional sites at the time), where few flint wares were found. The people living in the Beaver basin at that time arrived here at the end of the Palaeolithic from the so-called Federmesser and Ahrensburg cultures. After the climate warmed up, the remaining population here participated in the emergence of a Mesolithic community, referred to as the Protocomornic group. After further warming, however, they left the Bober region and a post-Maglemian population, probably from the Chojnice-Pienkowskie culture, arrived in the area at the end of the Boreal period. They were mainly involved in the exploitation of the forest and water environment (hunting, fishing). The end of Mesolithic settlement occurred at the end of the 2nd Neolithic period.

=== Neolithic Age (ca. 4500 - 1800 BC) ===
The Bolesławiec area was also penetrated in the Neolithic Age, especially by tribes of the corded ware culture. This is confirmed by a site of this culture discovered in Bolesławice (stone axe). The largest concentrations of settlements occurred in the Głogowska-Barycka Proglacial Valley, the Silesian Lowlands and the Raciborsk Basin, in places with the most fertile soils and somewhat depleted forests. Due to the considerable mobility of the tribes of this culture, it is thought that their farming methods were dominated by herding and some forms of pastoralism. Over time, the people of this culture were assimilated by an incoming community using better bronze products.

=== Bronze Age (1800 - 700 BC) ===
The most important archaeological culture of the Bronze Age was the Lusatian culture, preceded by the Pre-Lusatian culture, which, without losing its grave character, produced a whole range of local features. It was located between the Kaczawa River and the upper Beaver and Szprotawa Rivers. The settlement stabilisation of the people of this culture in Silesia, Saxony, Lusatia and Greater Poland probably took place at this time. An ear pin with a decorated head was found from this period of the so-called Classic Phase of the Prolongation Culture in Bobrowice near Szprotawa. In turn, a bronze hatchet with a rim was found in Osiecznica, not far from Bolesławiec. Although traces of Lusatian people have been found on the banks of almost the entire course of the Bóbr River, the area is not one of the large settlement areas (except in the vicinity of Żagań and Nowogród Bobrzański). A dozen or so sites discovered in the vicinity of Bolesławiec indicate, however, a rather intensive penetration of this part of the lands on the Bóbr River by communities of the Lusatian culture. These sites (cemeteries) are located, among others, in Bolesławiec, Bolesławice, Buczek Mały, Kruszyna-Godnów, Rakowice-Otok.

=== Iron Age (Late Roman period 400-500 AD) ===
The short Halstadt period (700-400 BC), in which the Lusatian culture collapsed, was followed by the Lateen Age (in the vicinity of Wrocław dated to between the 4th century BC and the end of the 2nd century AD). The Bolesławiec area was outside the influence of the &#x27;Celtic&#x27; cultural groups. Despite this, a bronze clasp with a free heel and shield was found in Bolesławiec. It represents a rare specimen of a Munssingen clasp with a chord wrapped around the bail. The second of the fibulae, an iron one with a free heel and a small decorated ball, belongs to the late version of the Duchcow clasp (named after a treasure in Duchcow). Both are early Late Late forms. It is presumed that these finds indicate the existence of an additional route of contact between the Celts and the North. In the area of Szprotawa and Stara Kopernia near Żagań, iron covalvic clasps have been discovered in graves of the Pomeranian culture. At the end of the 2nd century A.D., the place of the Celts was taken by the people of the Luboszycki culture (mid 2nd century - 4th - 5th century A.D.). Research into settlement in this area in the pre-Roman period and the Roman influence, with the exception of loose finds and pottery proving the existence of a settlement, has so far not confirmed the existence of a settlement here. This is because it was located on the borderline between the Luboszycka culture and the Legnic region of the Przeworsk culture. The aforementioned finds from the period of Roman influence (1st century BC - 6th century AD) are not impressive. Between 1932 and 1933, two Roman coins (one bronze) were discovered in Bolesławice, which were in private possession and are now considered lost. Much earlier (1820) a Roman denarius with a spear blade was discovered in Bolesławiec, followed in 1941 by a denarius of Gordian III from the years 238-244. These coins may prove the existence of a trade route in the area as early as the first half of the 1st millennium. What draws attention, however, is the discovery of a settlement (pottery) of the Luboszycki culture in Bolesławiec. Slightly further north of the city, in Parkoszów, a cemetery of this culture was found with five graves equipped with pottery and fragments of corpses as well as melted glass and a fragment of a comb. It is thought that settlement during this period occupied a small area along the Beaver River.

=== Bolesławiec in medieval Poland ===

The Slavs arrived in Silesia in the 7th century, but no traces of their residence at that time have been found in the Bolesławiec area, nor have the remains of the so-called Sukow-Szeligii culture, which covered, inter alia, Western Pomerania, Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Lusatia, Płock Mazovia, Greater Poland, Silesia and probably temporarily southern Lesser Poland. It occurred in the northern areas of Lower Silesia near Ślęza. The settlement situation in the Bolesławiec area in the 8th century is similarly unclear. According to some researchers, this area was part of the Tornow-Klenica zone, which included part of Lusatia, the Lubusz Land, part of Greater Poland and the northern territories of Lower Silesia. As before, sites confirming that Bolesławiec belonged to this zone have not yet been discovered. The first finds confirming the existence of a settlement in Bolesławiec at the turn of the 8th and 9th centuries are extremely valuable due to their form. This is because the end of a belt of the so-called Blatnica type was found, coming from the Blatnica-Mikulżice zone dated to 790-830. It is distinguished by wares created after the fall of the Avar caganate, referring to Western wares. The end of the belt found in Bolesławiec has Carolingian features. The spur found, on the other hand, is an imitation of early Carolingian wares. Thus, Bolesławiec is located on the border of the Early Carolingian influence, covering the Elbe Slavs, and then a belt east of the Oder and Lusatian Neisse up to Bolesławiec, and then as far as the Ślęza region and in a south-western direction covering Bohemia. An extremely important find is an iron bowl of the so-called Silesian type. Recently, it has been increasingly regarded as the original form of non-ruble money, which was superseded in Moravia and Malopolska by its more perfect form - the axe-like fine. The Bolesławiec bowl is the westernmost find of a fairly compact zone of such products in Silesia. After Silesia entered the circle of influence of the Great Moravian state, the Great Moravian influence, which is evident in the neighbouring Třebovian or Dziadoszan areas, did not reach the Boleslav region. Similarly, the Bohemian influences evident in the first tribe did not reach here.
The situation regarding settlement in Silesia in the 10th-11th centuries becomes somewhat clearer when one turns to written sources. In the light of these, the Bobrzan tribe spread to the west of the Trzebowians and Dziadoszan, in the middle Beaver basin. Their presence here is attested only by the so-called Praga document of 1086, which is admittedly suspect, but the data contained therein are generally accepted to correspond with the situation in 973. It states that the northern boundaries of the Prague bishopric are marked by the Trebouane (Trzebowians), Pobrane (Bobrzanians) and Dedosize (Dziadoszanians) tribes, which border the Miliczanians through the forest. Of these, only the Bobrzans could actually border the Miliczans. The name of this tribe clearly indicates that their headquarters should be sought on the Beaver River. Archaeological research has confirmed the existence of a larger settlement cluster between Szprotawa and Nowogród Bobrzański; it occupied an area of 350–400 km². It is in this area that most researchers situate the Bobrzan settlements. Therefore, Ilua (Iława), mentioned in Thietmar&#x27;s chronicle, would have been the capital city of the Bobrzans and the settlement of this tribe would have been concentrated around it. Thus, they would have been some small territorial unit of the kind found in Lusatia and the Elbe Serbs, among others. Their tribe may have separated during the territorial development of the Dziadoszans, by whom they were reabsorbed. In political terms, therefore, the Bobrzans were not a tribe, but part of a wider unit. The area around Bolesławiec is covered by an extensive primeval forest, well attested by sources. Archaeological research has shown that settlement in this area in the early medieval period was poorly developed. In fact, the functioning of a fortified settlement was only attested in Otoku, the existence of a fortified settlement in Łagów on the Kwisa River seems less likely. The existence of a stronghold in Bolesławice is admitted in some works. These were probably one of the southernmost Bobrzanski (Dziadoszanski) castles, whose communication with the main settlement centre was provided by the Bóbr and Kwisa rivers. A stronghold on the left bank in the area of Bolesławice, dated before the middle of the 10th century, was located by German archaeologists in the pre-war period as part of surface research. A new survey in 1960 failed to locate the fortress. Thus, the assumption was made that it was completely destroyed at that time. More recent works no longer deal with this fortress, considering it, and probably rightly so, to be a non-existent entity, a product of pre-war German historiography. The poorly attested settlement in this area in the early medieval period was initially due to the existence of a so-called zonal boundary running through a strip of forest between the Lusatian Neisse and the Beaver. With the development of settlement - Silesian on the one hand, and Lusatian-Milczański on the other - in connection with the demarcation of dominant estates, the zonal boundary turned into a linear boundary on the Kwisa and the Bóbr, finally shaped at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. The western border of Silesia then became the Kwisa.

According to legends, Bolesławiec was supposed to have been founded in the 10th century, during the reign of Mieszko I. In the area of the present-day Old Town, there were supposed to be three inns serving travellers on the route between Dresden and Wrocław, and there was supposed to be a defensive stronghold near these inns. Archaeological research in 2009 proved that there was a fortified settlement in the northern part of present-day Bolesławiec, on Topolowa Street, as early as the end of the 9th century[2], which suggests that there is a grain of truth in the legend of the three inns. According to the records of the 19th century Bergemann Chronicle, the Bolesławiec stronghold had to defend itself fiercely and victoriously against the invading Czech army in 1094.

As a result of the 12th-century fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies still ruled by the founding Piast dynasty, it formed part of the duchies of Silesia, Legnica and Jawor until 1392.
However, we do not have the first certain and source-confirmed information about Bolesławiec until around 1194. According to this version, Bolesławiec would have been named after Prince Bolesław Wysoki, who was to establish a settlement on the site of the present-day Old Town. It is very possible that St Dorothy&#x27;s Church was already founded at that time, and over time it was replaced by the present Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and St Nicholas, which is now a minor basilica. According to another legend, it was supposed to be built thanks to the foundation of a merchant from Wrocław, who was saved from a quagmire in the vicinity of Bolesławiec, and the founding of the church was for him the fulfilment of a vow he had made to God in a moment of danger. In the 13th century a Dominican monastery was also founded in the area of today&#x27;s Armii Krajowej and Teatralna Streets, at the crossroads of today&#x27;s Prusa and Zgorzelecka Streets there was Our Dear Lady&#x27;s Church, we also have information about the existence of St Jadwiga&#x27;s Church and the so-called Funeral Church, which was located in the cemetery in today&#x27;s Garncarska Street. From the 14th century we also have the first information about a wooden town hall existing in Bolesławiec.

Jews probably lived in Boleslawiec as early as 1190, when the burghers lent a certain amount of money, necessary for the construction of the city walls. In return, they were given their own street and synagogue[3][4].

Bolesławiec was located between 1226 and 1251, precisely in the area of the present Old Town. From this period we no longer have any information about the stronghold at Topolowa Street, which was probably abandoned. The town quickly became Germanised.

In 1361, the number of Jewish inhabitants was 360. Jews owned 31 houses. They were engaged in petty trade, crafts, small services

=== Boleslavice under Bohemia and Hungary ===

In 1392 Bolesławiec, then belonging to the Duchy of Jawor-Swidnica, came under Bohemian rule, as did the whole Duchy. In the 14th century, from the taxes imposed on the Jewish population, the citizens of Bolesławiec financed the construction of the city walls between the Upper Gate and the Nicholas Gate. On 18 June 1429, the city fell victim to a devastating Hussite raid, during which a large number of inhabitants were slaughtered and the whole of Boleslawiec was burnt down. The town was conquered as a result of the treachery of one of the townsmen, who set fire to the Upper Gate, located near the present-day Okrąglak on Piłsudski Square. Bolesławiec faced many years of reconstruction after these events. In 1454, the Jews were expelled from the city[6]. From 1469 to 1490 it was under the rule of Hungary, before falling back to Bohemia, then ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty. At the end of the 15th century, the expansion of St Mary&#x27;s Church took place, which resulted in the demolition of St Dorothy&#x27;s Church. Part of this church was incorporated into the expanding church. Remembrances of this reconstruction have survived to this day in the form of inscriptions, placed in the walls of the basilica. In 1524 Jacob Süssenbach came to Boleslawiec and delivered a moving sermon in St Mary&#x27;s Church. The sermon caused a large part of the townspeople to convert to the Protestant side. In time, the Dominican monastery was abolished and St Mary&#x27;s Church was turned into a Lutheran church, a state of affairs that did not change until 1629, when the church was returned to Catholics. The church housed the first known library of Boleslawiec. It was a so-called chain library, consisting of around 150 volumes.

From 1525 the architect Wendel Rosskopf was active in Boleslawiec, who took part in work on the interior of St. Mary&#x27;s Church (Basilica) and created the so-called Vow Palace, still to this day located in the town hall and until the 20th century serving as the town inn. The Renaissance sgraffito in the lower part of the Town Hall tower has been preserved to this day, around which a copy has been made. A magnificent Renaissance portal, funded by one of Boleslawiec&#x27;s 16th-century mayors, Paul Hanewald, leads to the Wedding Palace.

Bolesławiec was the birthplace of the German poet of the Baroque period, Martin Opitz, whose small monument has recently been located in Komuny Paryskiej Street. Opitz was one of the prominent representatives of the so-called Silesian poetic school, which had an enormous influence on German literature in the first half of the 17th century. Another well-known poet from this school, a native of Boleslawiec, was Andreas Scultetus. The city suffered severely during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when Swedish troops passed through Bolesławiec more than once, leaving ruins in their wake. In addition, in June 1623, the city was hit by a major plague epidemic that led to deaths Despite the great destruction, the city managed to recover from the losses it had suffered, as evidenced by the subsequent rebuilding of the interior of St Mary&#x27;s Church, during which it took on its current Baroque shape. In the 18th century, one of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town, and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

=== Bolesławiec in Prussian and German times ===

During the Silesian Wars, the town came under Prussian rule. In 1745, a graphic depicting the city of that time in detail was created by Friedrich Werner. It shows that the town occupied only a small part of its present area, bounded by medieval fortification walls. In the centre was the market square with the town hall, to the right of which was the parish church, the present basilica. The city had three gates - the Upper Gate (the area of today&#x27;s Piłsudski Square), the Lower Gate (the area of today&#x27;s Thermal Baths in Zgorzelecka Street) and the Nicholas Gate (located near the place where the intersection of Kutuzowa, Kubika and Komuna Paryska Streets is now). The city also had small suburbs in the area of the present Asnyka and Komuny Paryskiej Streets, and in the place of the present Defenders of Hel Park there was an Evangelical cemetery (surviving until the second half of the 20th century). In the area of today&#x27;s Castle Square one can still see the remains of a medieval castle, burnt down during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and in whose place an Evangelical church was built ten years later. In the second half of the 18th century an orphanage was opened in Boleslawiec, the buildings of which are still preserved today in Bankowa Street. The orphanage had a printing press, which, among other things, published scientific works.

In 1812, after the emancipation edict, Jews began to settle in the town again. In 1823, a prayer room was set up in the house of the widow Böhm at the then Kirchplatz
Napoleon Bonaparte visited the town six times during the Napoleonic wars, and Mikhail Kutuzov, the Russian Field Marshal, died here on 28 April 1813. The house in which he died has been presenved to this day and now houses the City History Department of the Boleslawiec Ceramics Museum. A few months after his death, in August 1813 the Russo-French battle for Bolesławiec took place, ending with the expulsion of the French from the city. After the end of the war, Bolesławiec, whose defensive walls were partially destroyed by the French army began to develop dynamically. On 1 October 1845 a railway station was opened in the town, and a year later a large railway viaduct, one of the longest in Europe, was opened Soon afterwards a histonc complex of a psychiatric hospital was built between the current Piast and Tysiąclecia Streets, where the Provincial Hospital for the Nervous and Mentally ill now operates. Many Bolesław citizens took part in the Franco-Prussian War and in the battles of the First World War. The latter were commemorated with monuments: In the Evangelical church and in the municipal forest in the present Jelenlogórska Street (both no longer extant). Despite these wars, the city developed intensively - new streets were built, a suburban railway and a city theater were opened.
A very important place on the pre-war map of Bolesławiec was the printing house of the Royal Orphanage, managed from 1872 by a printer of Jewish origin from Bolesławiec, Louis Fernbach. The Fernbach family managed the printing house until 1942 and during that time made it a very important printing center throughout Germany. The Fernbachs published a number of books and leaflets in Bolesławiec, but the newspapers brought them the greatest fame. In addition to the city newspaper Bunzlauer Stadtblatt, the printing house also published specialized newspapers - the most famous title was Der Photograph, which was published on a global scale. The Fernbachs were finally dispossessed of their property in 1942 by the Nazi authorities.

In 1913, the &quot;Metropol&quot; cinema was opened in Bolesławiec. Changes in Bolesławiec took place after Adolf Hitler took power in the Reich. The current Bolesława Chrobrego Street was named Adolf Hitler Strasse, and the NSDAP and Gestapo were established in the city. In April 1933, a boycott of Jewish stores in the city was carried out - uniformed SA officers took photos of people who wanted to shop there. After the Nuremberg Laws came into force, Jews were removed from state positions, organizations and associations. During &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; on November 9–10, 1938, Jewish businesses were looted and the synagogue was set on fire. During the war, Nazi propaganda plays were staged in the Bolesławiec theater for some time, and the people of Bolesławiec fought, among others, during the invasion of Poland.

====World War II====

Polish forced laborers worked around the city. During the war, the parish priest of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Father Paul Sauer, spoke out against the Nazis&#x27; actions.

During World War II, the Germans established two subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in the town. One, at the current Staroszkolna 18 street was established in May 1944 on the basis of the camp of Jewish prisoners subordinated to Organization Schmelt, which had already existed in 1942. For almost the entire period of its existence, 1,000-1,200 Jews were imprisoned there, mainly Polish and Hungarian. They worked in several local arms factories. The second camp, at the current Orla street, was intended for approximately 650 non-Jewish prisoners, mostly Poles, but also citizens of the Soviet Union and other countries. They worked and lived at the Concordia factory, producing parts for combat aircraft. As Soviet army units were approaching the city, on February 11, 1945, prisoners from both camps who were able to walk were evacuated by the Germans in a death march to the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp in Thuringia. 541 prisoners out of about 800 Jewish prisoners and 441 out of about 600 non-Jewish prisoners endured this march. A small number of patients from both camps were left there and waited to be liberated by Soviet soldiers.
After fighting with German troops, the city was captured on February 12, 1945 by the 7th Guards Tank Corps of the 3rd Guards Tank Army and the troops of the 52nd Army belonging to the 1st Ukrainian Front.

The city was seriously damaged by the Soviets after the capitulation of the Third Reich. Robberies, rapes and arson were common back then and Bolesławiec lost many monuments irretrievably. Almost all historic tenement houses standing on the town square were burned down, almost all former Dominican buildings on today&#x27;s Armii Krajowej Street were destroyed, as well as many other tenement houses and public buildings. City cemeteries were desecrated and destroyed, but St. Mary&#x27;s Church was saved from this fate.

=== Bolesławiec in post-war Poland ===

After the Potsdam Conference, its German inhabitants were expelled from the city and replaced by displaced persons from the Eastern Borderlands and repatriates from Yugoslavia and France. Numerous Red Army troops were stationed near Bolesławiec (Pstrąże, Świętoszów, Szczytnica, Karczmarka). The city was slowly rebuilt under Polish rule, but many historic tenement houses that could still be saved were demolished. This was the fate of the tenement houses on Asnyka Street, which were replaced by apartment blocks. We managed to prevent the demolition of the former Evangelical church, which was eventually taken over and renovated by the Roman Catholic Church. Gradually, the city began to expand again - the southern part of the large village of Bolesławice was absorbed and new housing estates were created in the eastern part of the city. From 1975 to 1998, Bolesławiec was administratively located in Jelenia Góra Voivodeship. In the 1980s, a student underground group operated in Bolesławiec for some time, printing patriotic leaflets and proclamations, supported by the city&#x27;s &quot;Solidarity&quot;. After the political transformation, the city began to develop even more dynamically - new churches were built, the Youth Cultural Center and the Bolesławiec Cultural Center expanded their activities, numerous renovations and renovations of many places in Bolesławiec were started, with the railway viaduct, the city Planty and the Market Square at the forefront. The gradual restoration of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, which was elevated to the status of a minor basilica on October 7, 2012, is still ongoing. In 2016, the 1st Secondary School celebrated its seventieth anniversary. Since the 1990s, the Bolesławiec Ceramics Festival has been held in Bolesławiec in the penultimate week of August, attracting tourists not only from Poland, but also from Europe and the rest of the world. On August 18, 2018, a free train of the Lower Silesian Railways, the so-called Ceramic Express. In 2023, the town was awarded the Europe Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

== Urban layout ==
The city has a very well-preserved medieval street grid surrounding the Baroque town hall. There are tenement houses along the market frontages and old town streets. The city was surrounded by a series of defensive walls with three city gates: &quot;Upper&quot; (at the end of ul. Sierpnia &#x27;80), &quot;Mikołajska&quot; (at the beginning of ul. Michała Kutuzowa) and &quot;Dolna&quot; (at the end of ul. Bolesława Prusa).

=== The Way of Saint James ===
The Lower Silesian Way of Saint James runs through the city - a section of the pilgrimage route to the tomb of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela in Spain.

==Pottery==

The town of Bolesławiec and its satellite communes Nowogrodziec, Ołdrzychów, and Bolesławice have a long ceramic history. The pottery is also identified with the German name for the town: &quot;Bunzlau&quot;. Bunzlauer ware (&quot;Ceramika bolesławiecka&quot;) evolved from a folk tradition into a distinct ceramic category distinguishable by form, fabric, glaze, and decoration. The term &quot;Bunzlauer ware&quot; may also be used to describe stylistically-related pottery produced in the neighboring districts of Lusatia and Saxony. Taken as a whole, Bunzlauer ware ranks among the most important folk pottery traditions in Europe.

The area around Bolesławiec is rich in clays suited to the potter&#x27;s wheel. Typically, utilitarian Bunzlauer pottery was turned on a kick wheel, dried leather-hard, dipped in a slip glaze and then burnt in a rectangular, cross-draft kiln. Although fired at temperatures of up to and often classified as stoneware, the clay actually does not vitrify and Bunzlauer pottery is better categorized as high-fired earthenware. In order to make their pottery watertight, Bunzlauer potters applied a coating of liquid clay, or slip. When fired, the slip glaze varied from a chocolate to dark brown. Since the fabric of Bunzlauer ware retains some porosity, the pottery conveniently has been suited for cooking over an open fire or for baking in an oven, as well as for storage.

===Origins===

There is archaeological evidence for pottery being turned in the region as early as the 7th century. Documentary evidence demonstrates potting activity in Bolesławiec itself by the 14th century. High-fired earthenware covered in brown and yellow lead glazes was being produced in Bolesławiec from the late 15th century. By 1473, five separate potteries were at work in the city, and in 1511 they came together to form a guild in order to enforce their monopoly of pottery making.

Early Bunzlauer pottery is exceedingly rare today. The majority of a potshop&#x27;s production would have been intended for farm and kitchen use: kraut containers, cheese sieves, pickling and preserve jars, baking forms, food molds, storage vessels, and so forth. Most of these stock-in-trade storage or cooking items have either disappeared or go unrecognized and undated today.

What has survived is the &quot;fancy ware&quot; intended for display on the table or in the parlor and used with care. In addition to their utilitarian items, the Bunzlauer potteries of Silesia turned out elegant tankards, pitchers and containers, all bathed in the brown slip &quot;glaze&quot; that characterized this early phase of the Bunzlauer style. The tankards and pitchers often received pewter mountings. The first examples of a distinctive Bunzlauer style are ball-shaped jugs and screw-lidded jars, often decorated with applied cartouches filled with intricate floral design. At first the entire pot, including the decorations, was covered in the same brown slip. Later examples used a yellowish lead glaze for the applied decorations which then stood out against the darker surface of the vessel (Adler, 95). A notable example of Bunzlauer pottery from this period is the hexagonal travel bottle with applied pewter mounts, originally belonging to Pastor Merge and dating to 1640–45.

A type of round-bodied jug with spiraling ribs called a &quot;melon jug&quot; attained popularity in the last quarter of the 17th century and continued to be produced on into the next century. Some examples gave up the application of slip in favor of colored lead glazes. After leaving the potshop, many of these melon jugs received pewter lids made by a tinsmith before being shipped off by wagon or on the back of peddlers to customers in Prussia, Bohemia, and Poland, even as far away as Russia.

===Industrialisation===
The simple blue-on-white spongeware and swirlware productions of the 1880s and 1890s with their clear feldspathic glazes were successful initially, but something still more colorful and forceful was needed if modern customers were to be attracted. This demand was met when, at the turn of the century, Bunzlauer pottery underwent a colorful transformation and a new chapter in its history was opened.

During the first decades of the 20th century, pot shops throughout Silesia and neighboring Lusatia began to decorate their wares with imaginative organic motifs derived from the contemporary Jugendstil aesthetic and applied by brush or, more often, with the aid of cut sponges. Floral designs were common embellishments, but the most popular was the Pfauenauge (peacock&#x27;s eye) design inspired by the Jugendstil decorators&#x27; fascination with the peacock&#x27;s rich plumage. The Pfauenauge motif became the unofficial, but universally recognized, signature trademark for this category of German spongeware.

By the beginning of the second decade of the new century, many of the potteries throughout the region had evolved into sophisticated ceramic studios, generally continuing to turn out the old utilitarian brown-slip production but giving ever-increasing attention to their new line of colorful ware. Although new designs, many based upon the orientalizing forms popular at the time, were introduced, traditional shapes for coffee pots, bowls, and pitchers were retained but with their surfaces now brightened with a wide variety of Jugendstil patterns, particularly, that of the Pfauenauge.

Even in the studio wares, the blend of folk art and high art is curious and charming, with many of the new and decorative elements taking on a decidedly &quot;country&quot; appearance. This is true for the production of the art potter, Friedrich Festersen (1880–1915), born in northern Schleswig, who opened his Kunsttöpferei Friedrich Festersen in Berlin in 1909 at about the same time that the peacock&#x27;s eye motif was beginning to embellish the ceramics of Bunzlau. Festersen&#x27;s connection with the Bunzlauer potteries is uncertain but the peacock&#x27;s eye motif is to be found throughout the production of his studio. There is no evidence that Festersen turned himself and the potters he employed may have come from Bunzlau, bringing the fashionable new designs with them. Although Festersen was a casualty of the First World War, his art pottery survived until 1922 under the leadership of his widow Sonja.

Increasingly, individual potters and workshops began to mark their wares. Among the prominent names were those of Robert Burdack (who introduced a unique technique of ceramic intarsia inlay), Julius Paul, Hugo Reinhold, and Edwin Werner from Bunzlau and from the surrounding towns of Tillendorf (Bolesławice), Ullersdorf (Ołdrzychów), and Naumburg am Queis came Karl Werner, Gerhard Seiler, Hugo Reinwald, Max Lachmann, Bruno Vogt, and Hermann Kuehn.

So popular did the new Bunzlauer style become that several of the firms, using the technical advice offered by the Bunzlau Keramische Fachschule, transformed their pot shops into large-scale, slip-casting ceramic factories. Leading the way in this manufacturing conversion was the pottery company of Julius Paul &amp; Sohn which was founded in 1893 and continued in operation until 1945. This company was rivaled in quality and innovative design by the firms of Hugo Reinhold, and Edwin Werner. While most of the potteries in Bunzlau and in the surrounding communities continued to utilize the forms by now traditional to Bunzlauer ware, these three &quot;high style&quot; firms experimented with Jugendstil aesthetics and such decorative additions as gold gilding.

All of these commercializing developments encouraged a flourishing export trade which brought shipments of Bunzluer pottery not only to all parts of Europe but into the United States as well, where it competed with similar but recognizably distinct wares produced in neighboring Saxony and Lusatia by such potters as Paul Schreier of Bischofswerda. In the United States, Bunzlauer ware was often marketed under the labels of &quot;Blue Mountain Pottery&quot; or &quot;Erphila&quot;, the acronym of the Philadelphia retailer Eberling &amp; Reuss.

===Post-war era===

The defeat of Germany in World War II and the transfer of the bulk of Lower Silesia to Poland, with the subsequent expulsion of the German population, threatened to end the Bunzlauer ceramic tradition, but it managed to survive in the shops established by displaced potters in the ceramic centers of West Germany, where Bunzlauer style pottery continued to be produced, long celebrated for their native earthenwares or salt-glazed and cobalt-decorated stonewares. Gerhard Seiler from Naumburg am Queis relocated to Leutershausen in Bavaria. Paul Vogt, also from Naumburg settled in Pang near Rosenheim. Max and Wilhelm Werner from Tillendorf initially moved to Höhr-Grenzhausen in the Westerwald range before setting up a shop in nearby Hilgert in 1960. Höhr-Grenzhausen also attracted Georg and Steffi Peltner as well as the firm of Alois Boehm. Georg Greulich opened his pottery in Fredelsloh. The Buchwald brothers relocated to Bayreuth, while Hans Wesenberg founded a studio in Ludwigsburg. Several of these master potters from the Bunzlau district took on fellow Silesian apprentices who went on to open shops of their own in western Germany. Thus, hundreds of miles to the west of Silesia, the Bunzlauer tradition remained alive and well.

The Bunzlauer style also has survived in the continuously functioning pot shops of former East Germany in the potting communities of Neukirch/Lausitz, Bischofswerda, Pulsnitz, and Königsbrück. The Upper Lusatian town of Königsbrück is home to the Frommhold Pottery, founded in 1851, the last survivor of 21 potteries once active in the community. The town of Neukirch has contained three active potteries to continue the tradition, that of the Kannegiesser family begun in 1824, that of Karl Louis Lehmann established in 1834, and the Heinke Pottery producing ware since 1866. Pulsnitz is the home of the Juergel Pottery, thought to have been responsible for first introducing the sponging technique and the peacock-eye motif into Lusatia.

Meanwhile, back in Bolesławiec, a new and Polish chapter in the pottery&#x27;s history was opening, after the city had been severely damaged in the war and its German population expelled. The Polish population that moved in found the surviving ceramic manufacturies stripped of machinery and equipment. Nevertheless, despite the lack of technical expertise in ceramic production in post-war Poland, one of the old factories was back in operation as early as 1946. But it was not until two years later that the first simple pots were being turned out.
The largest producer of Bolesławiec Polish pottery is Bolesławiec Artistic Ceramic. Most of its production is destined for export. It can be recognized by its trademark stamp based upon the three-tower Bolesławiec coat-of-arms below the letter &quot;B&quot;. This mark was used until 1996, when it was replaced by the letter &quot;B&quot; enclosed within the outline of a typical Bunzlauer coffee pot set above the castle. Bolesławiec pottery shipped to the United States will have &quot;Hand Made in Poland&quot; stamped on the base of each piece of crockery.

With the collapse of Communism, the two large state-owned ceramic manufacturies on the outskirts of Bolesławiec were privatized and several smaller private potteries were opened. In these smaller workshops, the potters turn each piece on the wheel but the larger manufacturies mold-cast their ceramics which are then hand finished, fired, hand decorated using either brush or sponge stamp, glazed and refired. The shapes and patterns found in the ceramic showrooms of Bolesławiec today and which are offered for sale, worldwide, at a number of outlet stores and internet sites, are staggering in variety: coffee pots, tea pots, cups, mugs, pitchers, platters, breakfast and dinner services, sets of bowls, candle holders, butter dishes cast in the shape of full-skirted peasant women, Christmas tree ornaments, all painted or sponge decorated in cheerful and colorful, folkloric patterns.
The Bolesławiec pottery that is most recognizable today is the white or cream colored ceramic with dark blue, green, brown, and sometimes red or purple motifs. Some of the designs used in this modern Polish pottery rendition of the older Bunzlauer ware harkens back to the German decorative motifs of the pre-war period but the new ceramic artisans of Bolesławiec have not hesitated to invent their own decorations, many of which are designed to have an especial appeal to the pottery&#x27;s growing international clientele. The most common designs in today&#x27;s production include sponge-stamped dots, abstract florals, speckles, windmills, and, of course, the famous &quot;peacock&#x27;s eye&quot;.

A growing appreciation for this ceramic category has been stimulated by a number of public exhibitions. The initial one, in which more than900 pieces were on display, was entitled &quot;Bunzlauer Geschirr: Gebrauchsware zwischen Handwerk und Industrie&quot; was held at three venues in Germany in 1986–88: the Museum fuer Deutsche Volkskunde in Berlin, the Hetjens-Museum in Düsseldorf and the Altonaer Museum in Hamburg. The catalogue to this exhibition has become the standard reference work for those interested in Bunzlauer pottery. Additional presentations of Bunzlauer pottery in Germany have included &quot;Guter Ton aus Bunzlau&quot; on view in 2004–05 at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg featuring examples from that institution&#x27;s extensive collection; &quot;Bunzlauer Keramik: Schlesisches Kunsthandwerk&quot; at the Keramik-Museum Berlin in 2008; &quot;Bunzlauer Tippel nach 1945&quot; at the Bunzlauer Heimatstube in Siegburg in 2009; and &quot;Bunzlauer Keramik – Gestern und Heute&quot; at the Haus des Deutschen Ostens in Munich in 2011 
-12. Polish museums also have contributed to the increasing public awareness of Bunzlauer pottery. In 1995, the Ceramics Museum in Boleslaweic collaborated with the Muzeum Narodowe, Wrocław (National Museum, Wrocław) in presenting &quot;Artystyczna Kamionka Bolesławiecka&quot;, utilizing the holdings of both museums. In 2008, Bolesławiec&#x27;s Ceramic Museum organized a show centered around one of the most prominent of the town&#x27;s pre-war potteries, that of Hugo Reinhold. &quot;Vom Kunsthandwerk zur Kunst – Bunzlauer Keramik aus dem Haus Reinhold&quot; was also exhibited in Germany at the Schlesisches Museum in Görlitz. Another of Bunzlau&#x27;s accomplished ceramic producers was celebrated in Austria when &quot;Art Deco Keramik Bunzlau: die Feinsteinzeugfabrik Julius Paul &amp; Sohn 1893–1945&quot; was presented at the Oesterreiches Postsparkasse in Vienna. In addition to these European exhibitions, there have been three showings of Bunzlauer ceramics in the United States. The first took place at the McKissick Museum of the University of South Carolina in Columbia, South Carolina in 1998 as part of an exhibit called &quot;Two Traditions in Transition: Folk Potters of Eastern Germany and the American South&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Bunzlauer Style: German Pottery from Jugendstil to Art Deco&quot;, presented in 2002 by the Georgia Museum of Art in Athens, Georgia. Bunzlauer Pottery also was featured in an exhibit at the Columbia Museum of Art in Columbia, South Carolina in 2005–06.

Older, pre-war examples of Bunzlauer pottery are avidly sought by collectors today. Private collections abound, especially in Germany but also abroad, including the United States where some individuals have amassed collections of more than 100 pieces of the pre-1945 pottery, most of which had been imported during the period between the two world wars. Extensive public collections of Bunzlauer ceramics are to be found in Poland at the &quot;Muzeum Ceramiki&quot; in Bolesławiec (with over 2000 pieces) and the National Museum in Wrocław; in Germany at the &quot;Schlesisches Museum&quot; in Görlitz, the permanent exhibition &quot;Keramik des Bunzlauer Töpfergebietes&quot; at Antik Leonhardt, Görlitz, at the &quot;Germanisches Nationalmuseum&quot; in Nuremberg, at the &quot;Keramik-Museum&quot; and at the &quot;Museum Europäischer Kulturen&quot; in Berlin, at the &quot;Haus der Begegnung&quot; of the Bundesheimatgruppe Bunzlau in Siegburg, at the &quot;Heimatmuseums&quot; in Neukirch/Lausitz and Pulsnitz, at the &quot;Museum für Sächsische Volkskunst&quot; in Dresden, and at the Sorbian Museum in Bautzen; and in the United States at the Columbia Museum of Art in Columbia, South Carolina which houses a collection of 110 pieces.

<text>Jelenia Góra (; ; ) is a historic city in southwestern Poland, within the historical region of Lower Silesia. Jelenia Góra is situated in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, close to the Karkonosze mountain range running along the Polish-Czech border – ski resorts such as Karpacz and Szklarska Poręba are situated from the city. Jelenia Góra constitutes a separate urban gmina as well as being the seat of surrounding Karkonosze County (formerly Jelenia Góra County). In 2021 the population of Jelenia Góra was 77,366. The area, including the oldest spa district of Cieplice Śląskie-Zdrój, is one of the most valued recreational and leisure spots in Poland.

The city&#x27;s history dates back to as early as the 10th century, but the settlement was granted town rights under Polish rule in 1288. Jelenia Góra was founded on important trade routes linking the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia with Eastern Europe. The region flourished as a result of trade privileges that became the basis for the establishment of weaving and mining industries during the Late Middle Ages and early Renaissance periods. Jelenia Góra witnessed many historical conflicts such as the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the decisive Silesian Wars. During World War II, the city was miraculously saved from destruction.

The central suburb of Jelenia Góra possesses many historical and architectural structures of great significance, including the 17th-century town hall, baroque churches and a restored central marketplace as well as parks and gardens. The nearby Karkonosze National Park, visited by over 1.5 million tourists annually, has its headquarters in the southwestern neighbourhood of Sobieszów.

==Names==
The city was mentioned by various names in historical sources:

* The Polish name &quot;Jelenia Góra&quot; together with &quot;Hyrszberg&quot; is mentioned in the book &quot;Krótki rys jeografii Szląska dla nauki początkowej&quot; published in Głogówek in 1847 by writer Józef Lompa. The 19th-century &quot;Geographical Dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland&quot; mentioned the city as &quot;Jeleniagóra&quot;. The Polish name &quot;Jelenia Góra&quot; was made official when the city became again part of Poland after World War II ended in 1945.
* In German, the city was mentioned as &quot;Hyrzberc&quot; (1281), &quot;Hyrspergk&quot; (1305), &quot;Hirssbergk&quot; (1355), and &quot;Hirsberg&quot; (1521), before eventually becoming the modern-day &quot;Hirschberg&quot;. In 1927–1945, the city was known as &quot;Hirschberg im Riesengebirge&quot;.
* In Czech, the city is known as &quot;Jelení Hora&quot;. Its historic Czech name, which was derived from the German name, was &quot;Hiršperk&quot;.
* In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Latin names appear in different records, e.g. &quot;Mons Cervi, Cervimontia, Monscervinus, Cervigera&quot;.

==History==
Human settlement in the area dates back to prehistoric times, and cemeteries of the Lusatian culture were discovered within the city limits during archaeological excavations.

===Middle Ages===
In the Early Middle Ages, the area was inhabited by the Bobrzanie, one of the old Polish tribes. In the 7th century it was part of the short-lived Samo&#x27;s Empire, and in around 990 it became part of the emerging Polish state under Mieszko I.

The city&#x27;s origins officially date back to the legendary founding of the settlement by the Polish duke Bolesław III Wrymouth of the Piast dynasty in 1108, and in 2008 the city celebrated its 900th anniversary. Jelenia Gora is also mentioned as having been used as a staging point by Bolesław III for his military campaigns against the Czechs in 1110. The original fortified hilltop &quot;gród&quot; over time developed into a sizable trading settlement, which expanded outside of the old fortifications, forming a suburb around the original settlement. The Piast &quot;gród&quot; has been preserved as an archeological site – now the Bolesław Wrymouth Hill. In 1242, Duke Bolesław II the Horned expanded the city&#x27;s fortifications.

In 1281, the city was given an urban charter by the Polish duke Bolko I the Strict when German settlers migrated to the region. In 1281 the settlement was first mentioned as &quot;Hyrzberc&quot;, and in 1288 in Latin as &quot;Hyrsbergensium&quot;. The city flourished in the 14th century, and became a center of crafts and trade. Weaving developed, and the citizens were exempt from tolls in trade with Wrocław and Bohemia. In 1317, the Corpus Christi Hospital was first mentioned in documents, although it possibly was founded in the 13th century. In 1345 a city council was established. In 1348 an earthquake struck the city, and Duke Bolko II the Small granted it new privileges. In 1361 the city was allowed to build a winery, market stalls and was given the privilege of minting its own gold and silver coins. When the Silesian Piasts lost inheritance and Agnes of Habsburg, the last duchess of Świdnica-Jawor died in 1392, the city passed to Bohemia, ruled by the House of Luxembourg.

In 1426 and 1427 the city was invaded by the Hussites. From 1469 to 1490 it was part of Hungary and afterwards it was part of Bohemia, ruled by the Jagiellonian dynasty.

===Modern era===
In 1502 King Vladislaus II issued a privilege extending the city&#x27;s autonomy and in 1519 King Louis II granted the right to an annual fair.

The town was inherited by Habsburg Austria in 1526, two years after the town adopted the Protestant faith. In 1533, all old privileges of the city were confirmed. In 1539, a second annual fair was established. In 1540 the municipal school suffered a fire. In 1548, the city refused to support Charles V in the religious Schmalkaldic War, for which he fined the city and deposed the mayor. A Protestant school was built in 1566. In 1560 a fire destroyed large parts of the city and stopped the economic development, which until then had been characterized by linen-weaving. The city recovered when Joachim Girnth, a shoemaker on a return journey from Holland, introduced veil-weaving. The first &quot;light veils&quot; were offered in 1625, and five years later the city received an imperial privilege by Ferdinand II for these veils.


During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the city suffered badly. It was beleaguered by troops of both parties, paid high contributions, and during a siege in 1634 the city burned down again. Two more sieges followed in 1640 and 1641. The town needed several years to recover. One reason for the new boost was the creation of a merchant society in 1658, which secured the city&#x27;s position as the most important center of linen and veil trade in the Silesian mountains during the 17th and 18th centuries.

The Protestants of the city were oppressed during the Counter-Reformation, but the second Treaty of Altranstädt, which allowed a Protestant community center and church to be established outside the medieval city walls, brought relief. Great sacrifices by the merchant society, especially its most prominent member Christian Menzel, made the construction of a large church, modelled after Church of Catherine in Stockholm, possible. The cemetery of the church was the preferred burial place for most merchant families.

Hirschberg was annexed with Lower Silesia by the Kingdom of Prussia during the Silesian Wars. The city was again partly destroyed, had to pay contributions and was seized several times. The detachment from Austria and the new border in the mountains to the south badly damaged the economy as the merchants lost a large part of their customers. Although Prussia took on substantial efforts to revive the economy, they never recovered completely and finally lost their position during the Industrial Revolution.

In 1800, John Quincy Adams, ambassador in Berlin at that time and future President of the United States, visited Hirschberg and said: &quot;Nothing can be more beautiful than the location of Hirschberg, a beautifully built city with numerous splendid buildings, in a valley surrounded by hills on all sides, with the magnificent view of the Giant Mountains&quot;.

In 1871 the town became part of the German Empire with the Prussian-led unification of Germany, as one of the largest towns in the Province of Silesia. In 1882, a railway connecting the city with Kowary was opened, and in 1905 it was further expanded to Kamienna Góra. In 1891, a railway connecting the city with Piechowice was opened, and in 1902 it was further expanded to Szklarska Poręba and Harrachov. In 1889 the &quot;Deutsche Riesengebirgsverein&quot; (German Giant Mountains Club), an organization to protect the environment of the Giant Mountains and to promote tourism, was founded by Theodor Donat and 47 other dignitaries of the region.

===20th century===
After World War I, the town became part of the Prussian Province of Lower Silesia in 1919, and in 1922 became a separate city. On September 1, 1939, the day of the German invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II, Luftwaffe used the airport in Hirschberg to conduct air raids on Poland. In April 1940, the first transport of 2,000 Poles deported from Sosnowiec, Będzin and Olkusz for forced labor arrived to the city. In the city, the Germans organized 19 labor camps in which they imprisoned mainly Poles, Czechs, Frenchmen and Belgians, but also Luxembourgers, Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, and Estonians, including women. They also established four prisoner-of-war camps: two for French, one for Jews from different countries and one for Soviets. French POWs organized a secret resistance movement and cooperated with Poles from other camps. There were also two subcamps of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, whose prisoners were mostly Poles and Jews from various German-occupied countries, chiefly Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Hungary. In 1943 and 1944 there was a significant influx of Germans from the bombed German cities, and in 1944, after the crushing of the Warsaw Uprising, Poles deported from Warsaw were temporarily imprisoned there. When the Red Army captured the city, as a result of the influx of people in the last years of the war, there were 160,000 people in the city.
According to the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, the city became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the 1980s. It became officially known by its Polish name of Jelenia Góra, which was first recorded in 1847. All remaining German inhabitants were expelled westward in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and Polish settlers came to the city. In the 1950s also Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in Jelenia Góra.

A local unit of the Freedom and Independence Association was formed in 1945 by former Home Army partisans. From October 1945, the Polish underground newspaper &quot;Wolność&quot; (&quot;Freedom&quot;) was issued and distributed in Jelenia Góra. In mid-1946, the communists carried out arrests of local resistance leaders, however, some managed to escape arrest.

In 1945, Jelenia Góra became the seat of the Polish &quot;Dolnośląskie Towarzystwo Turystyczno-Krajoznawcze&quot; (&quot;Lower Silesian Tourist and Sightseeing Society&quot;) founded in nearby Przesieka, and after its merger with the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society it remained a seat of its branch, which runs a number of mountain huts in the nearby Giant Mountains.

The city was not destroyed in the war, but the state of its buildings and infrastructure declined over the next decade. The communist authorities dismantled the neglected tenements around the Old Town until 1965 and destroyed the cemetery of the former German Protestant church. Since then the buildings around the market place have been reconstructed in simpler 18th-century historical forms.

The first written records from the mid-sixteenth century mention a population of approximately 3.5 thousand residents. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the population was about 6,000 people, to rise up to about 20,000 in the early twentieth century. The population in 1939 increased to over 35,000. During World War II, the city&#x27;s population skyrocketed, reaching 140,000, as Germany brought thousands of forced labourers and prisoners of war of various nationalities and due to an influx of refugees from German cities fleeing from Allied bombings. After the war, the city had a population of 39,000 residents, including more than 35,000 Germans. During the period 1945–1947, the German population was mostly expelled from Jelenia Góra in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

==Landmarks==
The Wojanowska gate and tower were part of the medieval defence complex that protected the road to Wojanów. Dungeons served as a prison. In 1480, the tower due to strong wind collapsed burying five people. Quickly it was rebuilt by adding the clock and the dome with a lantern, and this state has survived to this day. Coats of arms have been placed on the pillars: Prussian, Silesia, urban and inscription. In 1869, the gate was dismantled and moved to the barracks at Obrońców Pokoju street. After the renovation in 1998, returned to its former place. Located inside the medieval bastion was the St. Anne Chapel of the Wojanowska gate. In the portal above the entrance to the chapel there is an inscription: &quot; „HonorI Magnae ChrIstI aVlae DIVae Annae ereCta”&quot;(built for the glory of the great grandmother of Christ, St. Anna) with a hidden date of 1715.

The Basilica of St. Erasmus and St. Pancratius built in the 14th century features the chapel dedicated to the Patrons of Jelenia Gora; however, it got its present form in the next century. The church was built of stone in the form of a three-nave basilica topped with a tower. Even today, you can admire numerous Gothic stone details best preserved in portals and window frames. The southern portal is exceptionally rich and interesting. Two sepulchral chapels (from the 17th and 18th century) were built into the church&#x27;s walls; over 20 epitaphs and tombstones from the 16th and 18th century were placed on the two chapels. The main entrance to the chapel is located on the west, on the ground floor. The interior is also Gothic, but the fittings come from Renaissance and Baroque. The incredibly rich and monumental altar from the 18th century dominates the interior. The temple also houses priceless organs from the same period made in the workshop of an Italian organ builder – Adam Casparini. The 16th-century pulpit and the intarsiated (made of different wood types) choir stalls are a little older. There are also two 18th century figures on the church grounds – the Marian column is near the main entrance, and on the northern side, there is a sculpture of St. John of Nepomuk. It used to be located on one bridge over the Młynowka river; however, after it was damaged and then reconstructed in 1886, it was moved to its present place.

The Exaltation of the Holy Cross Church was erected as a proof of the grace of the Catholic Emperor of Austria for the Silesian evangelicals. Under the arrangement concluded in Altranstadt after a religious war they were granted the right to build six churches in Silesia which at that time was under Austrian rule. The design of the temple was prepared by the architect, Martin Frantz of Tallinn. The construction works lasted nine years (1709–1718) and the newly built church was deceptively similar to its prototype – St. Catherine&#x27;s Church in Stockholm (the work of the same designer). The structure was erected on the plan of a cross and topped with a dome. The interior was equipped with a three-storey matronea which can accommodate more than two thousand members of the congregation. The railings were adorned with citations and paintings displaying scenes from the Old and New Testament. The altar together with the organ front placed over it make up an extended, beautifully adorned architectural form.

The town hall is the central point of the market square. The building was erected between 1744 and 1749. The entire square is surrounded by Baroque tenement houses with arcades, which originally used to serve the merchants to sell their goods. At the beginning of the 20th century, the tenement houses near the City Hall were bought and adjoined to the town hall (the so-called &quot;Seven-Houses&quot;). Right next to the town hall there is a fountain with a sculpture of Neptune – god of the seas. The sculpture is to commemorate old trade relations with overseas lands.
The Schaffgotsch family ruling vast lands around Karkonosze settled in Cieplice in 1675. Their previous seat was Chojnik Castle, burned down due to lightning strike. Their Schaffgotsch Palace&#x27;s greatest ornament are the two semi-circular finished porticos with richly ornamented cartouches carrying the family crest of the owners. The interiors boasts early classicistic fittings. Since 1975, the palace has been housing a branch of the Wrocław University of Technology.

Jelenia Góra trams – Tram communication operated in Jelenia Góra in the years 1897–1969. Today there isn&#x27;t much left of it – fragments of the tram line and a plaque can be found near town hall. One of the old tram carriages can be found by the north entrance to the town hall and serves as a souvenir kiosk (the other two trams are placed in front of the tram depot, in Wolności Street and at the bus terminal in Podgórzyn).

<text>Owen D. Young (October 27, 1874July 11, 1962) was an American industrialist, businessman, lawyer and diplomat at the Second Reparations Conference (SRC) in 1929, as a member of the German Reparations International Commission.

He is known for the plan to settle Germany&#x27;s World War I reparations, known as the Young Plan and for the creation of the Radio Corporation of America. Young founded RCA as a subsidiary of General Electric in 1919; he became its first chairman and continued in that position until 1929. RCA was divested in 1932 and liquidated by GE in 1986.

==Early life and family==
Owen D. Young was born on October 27, 1874, on a small farmhouse in the village of Van Hornesville, Town of Stark, New York. His parents’ names were Jacob Smith Young and Ida Brandow and they worked the farm that his grandfather owned. Owen was an only child, his parents lost their first born son before he was born, and his birth was something rejoiced. He was the first male of the family to have a name that was not biblical since they had first arrived in 1750, driven from the Palatinate on the Rhine in Germany by constant war and religious persecution. They were taken in by the Protestant Queen Anne in England, sent to New York in 1710 to act to provide naval stores for the British fleet along the Hudson River, and eventually moving north and west, taking land from the Native Americans before settling along the Mohawk. The ‘D’ in his name was more for adornment than anything else, and so does not stand for anything.

Owen went to school for the first time in the spring of 1881. He was six years old, and had always been inclined to books and studying. He had a teacher, Menzo McEwan, who taught him for years, and would eventually be responsible for Owen going to East Springfield, one of the few secondary schools that he could afford. Of course, it was not too close to Van Hornesville, which had few secondary education opportunities near it. This took him away from the farm, where his help was needed, but his parents supported his pursuit of education to the point of later mortgaging the farm to send him to St. Lawrence University at Canton, New York.

He married Josephine Sheldon Edmonds (1870–1935) on June 13, 1898, in Southbridge, Massachusetts. A few years after Josephine died, he married the fashion designer and businesswoman Louise Powis Clark (1887–1965), a widow with three children.

===Children===
* Charles Jacob Young (December 17, 1899 – October 2, 1987), Scientist and inventor at RCA
* John Young (August 13, 1902 – August 21, 1926), (killed in a train accident)
* Josephine Young (February 16, 1907 – January 8, 1990), who became a poet and novelist, writing as Josephine Young Case
* Philip Young (May 9, 1910 – January 15, 1987), who became Dean of the Columbia Business School (1948–1953), Chairman of the Civil Service Commission (1953–1957), and United States Ambassador to the Netherlands (1957–1960)
* Richard Young (June 23, 1919 – November 18, 2011), Attorney, expert on international and maritime law, and law professor

==Education==
East Springfield Academy was a small coeducational school and Young greatly enjoyed his time there, making lifelong friends; later in life, he tried to attend all of the reunions. St. Lawrence was a small institute struggling to survive and in serious need of both money and students and Owen Young was a good candidate. It was still expensive enough to cause some hesitance, however. With his father getting on in years, Owen was needed on the farm more than ever. His parents were eventually convinced by the president of the college.

It was there that Young was able to grow as a person in both his education and his faith. He discovered Universalism, which allowed for more intellectual freedom, separate from the gloom and hellfire permeating other Christian sects. Young remained a student from September 1890 before becoming an 1894 graduate of St. Lawrence University, on June 27. He completed the three-year law course at Boston University in two years, graduating cum laude in 1896.

After graduation he joined lawyer Charles H. Tyler and ten years later became a partner in that Boston law firm. They were involved in litigation cases between major companies. During college, he not only became a brother of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, but he also met his future wife Josephine Sheldon Edmonds, an 1886 Radcliffe graduate. He married her in 1898, and she eventually bore him five children.

==Career==
Young represented Stone and Webster in a successful case against GE around 1911 and through that case came to the attention of Charles A. Coffin, the first president of General Electric. After the death of GE&#x27;s General Counsel Hinsdill Parsons in April 1912, Coffin invited Young to become the company&#x27;s Chief Counsel and Young moved to Schenectady. He became GE&#x27;s president in 1922 and then in the same year was appointed chairman, serving in that position until 1939. Under his guidance and teaming with president Gerard Swope, GE shifted into the extensive manufacturing of home electrical appliances, establishing the company as a leader in this field and speeding the mass electrification of farms, factories and transportation systems within the US.

In 1919, at the request of the government, he created the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) to combat the threat of English control over the world&#x27;s radio communications against America&#x27;s struggling radio industry. He became its augmentation chairman and served in that position until 1929, helping to establish America&#x27;s lead in the burgeoning technology of radio, making RCA the largest radio company in the world. In 1928, he was appointed to the board of trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation under a major reorganization of that institution, serving on that board also up to 1939.

Young&#x27;s participation in President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Second Industrial Conference following World War I marked the beginning of his counseling of five U.S. presidents. In 1924, he coauthored the Dawes Plan, which provided for a reduction in the annual amount of German reparations. After the Allied Powers had settled their war debts to Washington, a new international body met beginning in 1928 to consider a program for the final release of German obligations; Young acted as chairman. Germany&#x27;s total reparations were reduced and spread over 59 annual payments. After establishing this &quot;Young Plan&quot;, Young was named Time Magazine&#x27;s Man of the Year in 1929. The Young Plan collapsed with the coming of the Great Depression.
Young was also instrumental in plans for a state university system in New York.
In 1932, he was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. He did not campaign actively, but his friends promoted his candidacy beginning in 1930 and at the 1932 Democratic National Convention. He was highly regarded by candidates Alfred E. Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and some convention observers speculated that they would support Young in the event of a convention deadlock.

===Retirement===

In 1930, he built the Van Hornesville, New York, Central School in his hometown to consolidate all the small rural schools in the area. In 1963, it was renamed Owen D. Young Central School in his honor. Long active in education, Young was a trustee of St. Lawrence University from 1912 to 1934, serving as president of the board the last 10 years. The main library of the university is named in his honor.

After Young married Louise Powis Clark in 1937, the couple created a winter estate in Florida that included a formal garden and citrus stand along State Road A1A. In 1965, Louise gifted the estate to the State of Florida, and it is now the site of Washington Oaks Gardens State Park.

In 1939, he formally retired to the family farm in New York, where he began dairy farming. He died in Florida on July 11, 1962, following several months of poor health.

==Legacy==
More than 20 colleges awarded him honorary degrees. He was an elected Member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Long interested in education, he was a member of the New York State Board of Regents, governing body of New York&#x27;s educational system, until 1946. Then, New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey called upon him to head the state commission that laid the groundwork for the State University of New York system. Although the commission represented a wide range of views and opinions, Young achieved a surprising unanimity that resulted in a report containing recommendations adopted by the legislature. He was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Consumer Technology Hall of Fame in 2019.

<text>The Calvary Holiness Association is a Holiness Pentecostal denomination of Christianity that is based in Georgia, United States.

== History ==
The Holiness movement among Baptists in Georgia began late in the 19th century among ministers in the Little River Baptist Association. Two churches were excluded from the Little River Association in 1893 because of their teachings on holiness. These two churches and two newly formed churches met in 1894 in Wilcox County, Georgia to organize the Holiness Baptist Association.

The Calvary Holiness Association was formed in 1977. Dissatisfied members separated from the &quot;Holiness Baptist Association&quot; on January 7, 1977 for what they termed &quot;broken confidence and lack of trust in the trustee committee&quot;. On January 15, 1977, nine churches met at Community Holiness Baptist Church in Cook County, Georgia and organized a new association, with James A. Harrell as moderator, and Carl H. Carlton as clerk. Four more churches joined on January 29, and a committee of seven was formed to draw up articles of faith, discipline and rules of decorum. On March 26, the articles of faith and by-laws were adopted, the name &quot;Calvary Holiness Association, Incorporated&quot; agreed upon, and an application to incorporate made. The Association was incorporated and charter granted by the state of Georgia on October 7, 1977.

The faith and order is similar to the parent body. The association&#x27;s beliefs include three works of grace (1) New Birth (first work of grace), (2) entire sanctification as a definite second work of grace, (3) Baptism of the Holy Ghost, with glossolalia as the initial evidence (third work of grace). Its ordinances include baptism by immersion, Lord&#x27;s supper and feet washing. Tithing is practiced. They maintain abstinence from any use of tobacco or strong drink, excessive use of medicine, use of slang expressions, gluttony, and that ordinary labor and business should not be conducted on Sunday. Membership in secret societies (such as the Masonic Lodge) is forbidden. The &quot;Calvary Holiness Association&quot; maintains &quot;Calvary Holiness Campground&quot; in Coffee County, Georgia south of Jacksonville. Annual association meetings, youth camps and camp meetings are held at the campground.

In 1985 the association was made up of 17 churches with 464 members, in 13 counties in the southern part of the state of Georgia. 27 ordained ministers, 4 licensed ministers, and 4 exhorters were serving these churches.

Calvary Holiness Association is affiliated with a Holiness Pentecostal seminary known as Heritage Bible College in Savannah, Georgia.

<doc id="387038" wikidata="Q6046075" url="?curid=387038" title="Interdictor">
<text>An interdictor is a type of attack aircraft or tactical bomber that operates far behind enemy lines, with the express intent of air interdiction of the enemy&#x27;s military targets, most notably those involved in logistics. 

==Interdiction==
Interdiction prevents or delays enemy forces and supplies from reaching the battlefront; the term has generally fallen from use. The strike fighter is a closely related concept, but puts more emphasis on air-to-air combat capabilities as a multirole combat aircraft. Larger versions of the interdictor concept are generally referred to as &quot;penetrators&quot;.

==Operation==
In the post-war era, the RAF introduced interdictor variants of their English Electric Canberra jet bomber, as aircraft were released from the strategic bombing role as they were replaced by the new V bombers. Desiring a more modern aircraft for this role, development of the BAC TSR-2 (from &quot;Tactical Strike and Reconnaissance, Mach 2&quot;) began, but this program was later cancelled. The US began development of a similar aircraft around the same time, which emerged as the General Dynamics F-111. The failure of the TSR-2 and a desire by other European nations for a similar design led to the Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) program, although operating over shorter ranges in the European theatre which was realised as the Panavia Tornado Interdictor/Strike (IDS). The Soviet Sukhoi Su-24 emerged in the early 1970s.

In order to safely traverse a heavily defended front line, they flew at very low altitudes (in some cases having to pull up to clear power lines) to use terrain masking to protect them from enemy radar-guided weapons. Flying at low altitude also demands much greater fuel use, and thus interdictor aircraft were generally fairly large.

<doc id="387041" wikidata="Q2996101" url="?curid=387041" title="English usage controversies">
<text>In the English language, there are grammatical constructions that many native speakers use unquestioningly yet certain writers call incorrect. Differences of usage or opinion may stem from differences between formal and informal speech and other matters of register, differences among dialects (whether regional, class-based, generational, or other), difference between the social norms of spoken and written English, and so forth. Disputes may arise when style guides disagree, when an older standard gradually loses traction, or when a guideline or judgment is confronted by large amounts of conflicting evidence or has its rationale challenged.

==Examples==
Some of the sources that consider some of the following examples incorrect consider the same examples to be acceptable in dialects other than Standard English or in an informal register; others consider certain constructions to be incorrect in any variety of English. On the other hand, many or all of the following examples are considered correct by some sources.
* Generic &quot;you&quot; – e.g., &quot;Brushing your teeth is a good habit&quot; as opposed to &quot;Brushing one&#x27;s teeth is a good habit&quot;
* Singular &quot;they&quot; – e.g., &quot;Somebody left their sweater&quot; or &quot;My friend left their sweater here&quot;

* Flat adverbs – e.g., &quot;Drive safe&quot; as opposed to &quot;Drive safely&quot; &quot;It sure is&quot; as opposed to &quot;It surely is.&quot; 
* Split infinitives – e.g., &quot;To boldly go where no man has gone before&quot; as opposed to &quot;To go boldly where no man has gone before&quot;
* Beginning a sentence with a conjunction – e.g., &quot;But Dad said not to jump on the bed!&quot;
* Double genitive – e.g. &quot;a friend of theirs&quot; as opposed to &quot;a friend of them&quot; or &quot;their friend&quot;
* Using &quot;me&quot; vs. &quot;I&quot; in the subject complement (&quot;It&#x27;s me&quot; as opposed to &quot;It&#x27;s I&quot; or &quot;It is I&quot;) or other cases – e.g., &quot;Me and Bob&quot; vs. &quot;Bob and I&quot;
* Using &quot;I&quot; vs. &quot;me&quot; in the oblique case, e.g., &quot;He gave the ball to Bob and I&quot; instead of &quot;He gave the ball to Bob and me&quot;. This is often called a hypercorrection, since it is perceived as related to avoidance of the stigmatized incorrect use of the oblique form. 
* The validity of &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot; as a negative first-person singular contraction for &quot;to be&quot; in interrogative uses – e.g., &quot;Aren&#x27;t I the one you were talking about?&quot; 
* The grammatical means for marking counterfactuality – e.g., &quot;If I were/was a rich man&quot; and &quot;If the pandemic didn&#x27;t happen/hadn&#x27;t happened&quot;. 
* Whether to use &quot;who&quot; or &quot;whom&quot; in various contexts
* The use of &quot;less&quot; or &quot;fewer&quot; with count nouns
* Double negatives as negative concord – e.g., &quot;We don&#x27;t need no education&quot;
* Certain double modals – e.g., &quot;You might could do it&quot; – not considered standard, but used for example in Southern American English
* Double copula – e.g., &quot;What has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere&quot;
* Preposition stranding – e.g., &quot;You have nothing to be afraid of&quot; (vs. &quot;You have nothing of which to be afraid&quot;) – criticized by grammarians in the 1600s by analogy with Latin grammar and by some teachers since, though many have always accepted it as part of standard English
* Distinction or lack of it between the past and past participle forms of the verb – e.g. &quot;I should have &quot;went&quot;&quot; and &quot;I &quot;done&quot; that yesterday&quot;.
* Order of quoted punctuation marks, i.e., American style (&quot;Many dreams were characterized as &#x27;raw,&#x27; &#x27;powerful,&#x27; and &#x27;evocative) vs. British style (&#x27;Many dreams were characterized as &quot;raw&quot;, &quot;powerful&quot; and &quot;evocative). Some American authorities (such as the APA and CMS) require the former, while others (such as the LSA) allow, prefer, or require the latter.
* Whether the verbs &quot;open/close&quot; to denote &quot;turn on/turn off&quot; can be used as English collocations (i.e. &quot;Open the lights, please&quot; for &quot;Turn on the lights, please&quot;). The expression is a metaphrase and is common among nonnative English speakers of Hebrew, Croatian, Filipino, French, Thai, Chinese, Greek, Italian descent, and also among French Canadians (or some speakers of Quebec English), where &quot;open&quot; and &quot;close&quot; for &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; are used instead. This construction is grammatically correct but only out of context. The calquing and linguistic transfer make this construction foreign to other English speakers.

Several proscriptions concern matters of writing style and clarity but not grammatical correctness:
* Dangling modifiers (including dangling participles) are often cited as potentially causing confusion.
* Various style guides warn writers to avoid the passive voice.
* Gender neutrality in English:
** Gender-specific and gender-neutral pronouns – Replacing masculine pronouns where they are meant to refer to a person of either gender with both masculine and feminine pronouns, alternative phrasing, the singular they or newly invented words like &quot;hir&quot; and &quot;ze&quot;
** Terms for humans in general – Replacing nouns like &quot;mankind&quot; with &quot;humankind&quot;
** Gender marking in job titles – Replacing nouns like &quot;chairman&quot; and &quot;manpower&quot; with alternatives like &quot;chairperson&quot; and &quot;staffing levels&quot;
** Use of Ms. for equality with Mr., as opposed to Miss and Mrs., which specify whether the woman is married; there are no similar titles for men that specify whether the man is married.

==Factors in disputes==
The following circumstances may feature in disputes:

===Myths and superstitions===
There are a number of alleged rules of unclear origin that have no rational basis or are based on things such as misremembered rules taught in school. They are sometimes described by authorities as superstitions or myths. These include rules such as not beginning sentences with &quot;and&quot; or &quot;because&quot; or not ending them with prepositions .

===No central authority===
Unlike some languages, such as French (which has the Académie Française), English has no single authoritative governing academy, so assessments of correctness are made by &quot;self-appointed authorities who, reflecting varying judgments of acceptability and appropriateness, often disagree.&quot;

===Education===
While some variations in the use of language correlate with age, sex, ethnic group, or region, others may be taught in schools and be preferred in the context of interaction with strangers. These forms may also gain prestige as the standard language of professionals, politicians, etc., and be called Standard English (SE), whereas forms associated with less educated speakers may be called nonstandard (or less commonly substandard) English.

===Stigma===
The prescriptivist tradition may affect attitudes toward certain usages and thus the preferences of some speakers.

===Hypercorrection===

Because of the stigma attached to violating prescriptivist norms, speakers and writers sometimes incorrectly extend usage rules beyond their scope in attempting to avoid mistakes.

===Classical languages===
Prescriptivist arguments about various English constructions&#x27; correctness have sometimes been based on Latin grammar.

===Analogy with other constructions===

It is sometimes argued that a certain usage is more logical than another, or that it is more consistent with other usages, by analogy with different grammatical constructions. For instance, it may be argued that the accusative form must be used for the components of a coordinate construction where it would be used for a single pronoun.

Speakers and writers frequently do not consider it necessary to justify their positions on a particular usage, taking its correctness or incorrectness for granted. In some cases, people believe an expression to be incorrect partly because they also falsely believe it to be newer than it really is.

==Prescription and description==

It is often said that the difference between &quot;prescriptivist&quot; and &quot;descriptivist&quot; approaches is that the former prescribes how English &quot;should&quot; be spoken and written and the latter describes how English &quot;is&quot; spoken and written, but this is an oversimplification. Prescriptivist works may contain claims about the incorrectness of various common English constructions, but they also deal with topics other than grammar, such as style. Prescriptivists and descriptivists differ in that, when presented with evidence that purported rules disagree with most native speakers&#x27; actual usage, the prescriptivist may declare that those speakers are wrong, whereas the descriptivist will assume that the usage of the overwhelming majority of native speakers defines the language, and that the prescriptivist has an idiosyncratic view of correct usage. Particularly in older prescriptivist works, recommendations may be based on personal taste, confusion between informality and ungrammaticality, or arguments related to other languages, such as Latin.

==Different forms of English==

===English internationally===
English is spoken worldwide, and the Standard Written English grammar generally taught in schools around the world will vary only slightly. Nonetheless, disputes can sometimes arise: for example, it is a matter of some debate in India whether British, American, or Indian English is the best form to use.

===Regional dialects and ethnolects===

In contrast to their generally high level of tolerance for the dialects of other English-speaking countries, speakers often express disdain for features of certain regional or ethnic dialects, such as Southern American English&#x27;s use of &quot;y&#x27;all&quot;, Geordies&#x27; use of &quot;yous&quot; as the second person plural personal pronoun, and nonstandard forms of &quot;to be&quot; such as &quot;The old dock bes under water most of the year&quot; (Newfoundland English) or &quot;That dock be under water every other week&quot; (African-American Vernacular English).

Such disdain may not be restricted to points of grammar; speakers often criticize regional accents and vocabulary as well. Arguments related to regional dialects must center on questions of what constitutes Standard English. For example, since fairly divergent dialects from many countries are widely accepted as Standard English, it is not always clear why certain regional dialects, which may be very similar to their standard counterparts, are not.

===Register===
Different constructions are acceptable in different registers of English. For example, a given construction will often be seen as too formal or too informal for a situation.

<text>Lubliniec (, ; Silesian: &quot;Lublini&#x27;c&quot;) is a town in southern Poland with 23,784 inhabitants (2019). It is the capital of Lubliniec County, part of Silesian Voivodeship.

==Geography==
Lubliniec is situated in the north of the historic Upper Silesia region at the rim of the Upper Silesian Industrial Region, about northwest of Katowice. It is an important rail hub, with two major lines crossing there – east-west (from Częstochowa to Opole) and south–north (from Katowice to Poznań) – and a site of light and chemical industry. The surrounding area is characterized by extended forests (&quot;Lasy Lublinieckie&quot;), including the Upper Liswarta Forests Landscape Park north of the town.

==History==
Lubliniec was established about 1270 by the Piast duke Władysław of Opole on the road leading from his residence Opole to Kraków. It was part of the Duchy of Opole within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. According to old folk tradition the name comes from the Polish sentence &quot;lubi mi się tu kościół i miasto budować&quot;, which refers to the erection of the church and the town by Duke Władysław. In medieval Polish documents the town appeared under the names &quot;Lubie&quot;, &quot;Lublin&quot; and &quot;Lubin&quot;, and then morphed to Lubliniec for distinction, as mentioned by 15th-century Polish chronicler Jan Długosz. Under the name Lubliniec it was mentioned in a 1612 Polish poem &quot;Officina ferraria, abo huta y warstat z kuźniami szlachetnego dzieła żelaznego&quot; by Baroque poet . By the turn of the 13th to the 14th century it had obtained the status of a town according to Magdeburg Law by Władysław&#x27;s son and successor Duke Bolko I. He had been one of the first Silesian dukes to become a Bohemian vassal in 1289, however it remained under the rule of the local branch of the Polish Piast dynasty until 1532. The Piast dukes erected a castle in Lubliniec. Duke Jan II the Good granted the citizens many privileges, including brewing and market rights as well as the permit to form guilds.

Upon Jan&#x27;s death in 1532, Lubliniec with the Duchy of Opole fell as a reverted fief to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, which since 1526 were ruled by the Austrian House of Habsburg. In 1638 the town was visited by King of Poland Władysław IV Vasa. In 1645 along with the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz it returned to Poland under the House of Vasa, and in 1655 the Black Madonna of Częstochowa was briefly hidden at the local castle by the Poles during the Swedish invasion of Poland. In 1666 the town fell to the Habsburg monarchy again, until it was annexed with most of Silesia by the Prussian king Frederick the Great in 1742.

The town was an important center of Polish Bar Confederates, and in the 1770s it was visited several times by Kazimierz Pułaski, one of the Confederates&#x27; military commanders and soon-to-be hero of the American Revolutionary War. In the late 18th century the town was held by the Polish noble Grotowski family. In 1812 Franciszek Grotowski founded an institute, which purpose was to take care of orphans and provide them with education, and a new orphanage was built in 1848. To this day the facade of the former orphanage is decorated with a relief of the Łodzia coat of arms of the Grotowski family. The town was a center of Polish resistance against Germanisation policies. 19th-century Polish publicist, activist and poet printed many of his works in the town. In the 19th century the county&#x27;s population remained overwhelmingly Polish and Catholic by confession. In 1871 the town became part of Germany. The first railway reached it by 1884. The former castle of Lubliniec was converted into a hospital for the poor in 1893, then altered to a psychiatric hospital in 1895/96.

After World War I, Poland regained independence in 1918, and the region was divided according to the Upper Silesia plebiscite in 1921, whereby 88% of the Lublinitz citizens voted for continuance in the German Weimar Republic, while 47% of the citizens of the entire county voted to join the reborn Polish state. Nevertheless, after Wojciech Korfanty had initiated the Third Silesian Uprising from the nearby village of Czarny Las, it was incorporated into the Silesian Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic and became a border town. In the interbellum the Polish 74th Infantry Regiment was stationed in Lubliniec.

Again occupied in the 1939 invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany during World War II (and renamed Loben, 1941–45). During the German occupation, the Polish population was subjected to mass arrests, imprisonment, deportations to Nazi concentration camps and executions. On September 8, 1939, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe II&quot; entered the town to commit various crimes against Poles. 180 civilian defenders were murdered immediately by the invading Germans in September 1939, in accordance with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s orders to execute Polish &quot;partisans&quot; immediately. Soon after capturing the city, the Germans took over the local psychiatric hospital, and several hundred children were murdered there during the occupation as part of the &quot;Aktion T4&quot;. There were also cases in which the killed children&#x27;s brains were used for medical research by the Germans in Wrocław, as mentioned by German doctor Elisabeth Hecker, who was in charge of the hospital since 1941. The Germans also established and operated a Nazi prison in the town, and the E609 forced labour subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the present-day district of Kokotek. Teachers from Lubliniec were among Polish teachers imprisoned and murdered in concentration camps. The area was conquered by the Red Army in January 1945 in the course of the Vistula–Oder Offensive, and then restored to Poland.

From 1975 to 1998, Lubliniec was administratively located in the Częstochowa Voivodeship.

<text>The Shing Mun River (Chinese: 城門河) or Shing Mun River Channel (Chinese: 城門河道) is a river in Sha Tin, Hong Kong.

==History==
The original Shing Mun River began at Needle Hill, and flowed into the former Tide Cove (Sha Tin Hoi), a shallow bay. In the 1970s, Tide Cove was reclaimed and turned to Sha Tin New Town. The river was extended through a 7 km long, 200 m wide artificial channel in the middle of the area to flow into Tolo Harbour. Other rivers that had originally flowed into Tide Cove are now tributaries of Shing Mun River in the form of concreted nullahs.

The Shing Mun River channel runs from the Tai Wai area, through the Sha Tin town centre to the Tolo Harbour. It has three main tributaries, namely Tai Wai Nullah, Fo Tan Nullah and Siu Lek Yuen Nullah. Along the Shing Mun River are high-rise residential, commercial and industrial buildings with numerous village-type developments such as City One Shatin and Wo Che Estate scattered around. Several bridges were built to connect the two sides of the Shing Mun River.

==Bridges==
There are several major bridges across the Shing Mun River:
* Banyan Bridge () on Fo Tan Road
* Dragon Bridge () on Sha Tin Road
* Lion Bridge () on Lion Rock Tunnel Road
* Sand Martin Bridge () on Sha Tin Rural Committee Road
* Lek Yuen Bridge – a pedestrian bridge

==Current usage==
Although the river is primarily designed for the drainage of storm water from Sha Tin with a catchment area of 37 km2, it is also a popular place for recreational users such as rowers, anglers, riverside walkers and cyclists. There are continuous pedestrian promenades on both sides of the river.

Many species of trees has been planted along the riverside, such as the Chinese Banyan and a few cotton trees.

Shing Mun River is a popular place for water sports, such as: rowing, canoeing, kayaking and dragon boat racing. There are three boathouses in the river, located at Yuen Wo Road and Shek Mun respectively. The river has a standard of 2000 metres long for regattas.

==Sports events==

*Dragon Boat Racing competition is held on Shing Mun River at Dragon Boat Festival every year since 1984. 

* A section of the Hong Kong leg of the 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay was held on the Shing Mun River Channel.

==Pollution==

The Shing Mun River was once heavily polluted from the indiscriminate discharges from livestock, industrial, commercial and domestic sources. The total organic pollution load from these discharges amount to a population equivalent of 160,000 in the 1980s. At that time, hardly any living creatures were found in the river.

The water quality of Shing Mun River has improved from bad to good in terms of the Water Quality Index since 1993. Lifeforms including fish and invertebrates have also reappeared in the river. In 2001, bioremediation and dredging works began to further improve the river environment. Levels of odour-causing sulphides and E. coli subsequently dropped sharply. But the water quality is still threatened by the polluted condition of Tolo Harbour, which backflows into the Shing Mun River during high tide, causing contamination.

An artificial river bank was also built along a 250-metre section near Man Lai Court, where there are relatively severe sediment accumulations and odour problems.

In late 2015, the Fo Tan Nullah, which flows into the Shing Mun River, changed colours several times. In early December it turned an electric blue, while later in the month it was ‘partly grey and partly turquoise’. Residents and green groups speculated on whether the pollution was caused by the illegal dumping of pigments or industrial waste. The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) and Drainage Services Department investigated but were unable to determine the cause of the pigmentation as of December 2015. An EPD test revealed that the river was polluted by sewage.

Aside from the colour changes in the Fo Tan Nullah, tests conducted in December 2015 by a private laboratory at the behest of Sha Tin District Councillor Scarlett Pong Oi-lan revealed that pollution had worsened in the Shing Mun River. The tests showed that the &quot;E. coli&quot; are 1,300 times the EPD standard, while water acidity and suspended solids are three times the standard. Pong said that the &quot;E. Coli&quot; concentration was at its highest level since 1995.

In early 2016, thousands of fish died in the river.

On 1 November 2016, the real estate company Link REIT was fined $15,000 for contravening the Water Pollution Control Ordinance because wastewater from the Mei Lam Shopping Centre, owned and managed by Link REIT, was being illegally discharged into the Shing Mun River. The company was ordered to rectify the situation immediately.

<doc id="387045" wikidata="Q731079" url="?curid=387045" title="Myszków">
<text>Myszków is a town in Poland, with 31,650 inhabitants (2019). Situated on the Warta river in the Silesian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Częstochowa Voivodeship (1975–1998), it is the capital of Myszków County. Myszków historically belongs to Lesser Poland, and the area where the town is located was, until the Partitions of Poland, part of Kraków Voivodeship&#x27;s County of Lelów. Myszków is located along one of the oldest Polish rail lines, the Warsaw–Vienna railway, and near the Central Rail Line.

==Coat of arms==
Myszków has for years been a center of heavy industry, which is reflected in the town&#x27;s coat of arms. Created in 1969, it shows four black smokestacks, with fumes coming from the two in the middle. Above the smokestacks is the White Eagle, on the sides are two heads of corn, and the blue ribbon symbolizes the Warta river.

==History==

The history of the town called Myszków is very short, and goes back to 1825, when the commune (gmina) of Myszków was created, part of Kielce Voivodeship. It was incorporated as a town in 1950, and the Myszków County was created in 1956. After World War II (August 1945), Lesser Poland&#x27;s Myszków was transferred to &quot;Silesian – Dąbrowa Voivodeship&quot;, which in 1950 changed name to Katowice Voivodeship. In 1975 Myszków became part of Częstochowa Voivodeship, and in 1983 the town expanded, when the villages of Potasznia, Mrzygłód, Mrzygłódka, Nierada, Krwciwilk, Ręby, Łabry and Smudzówka were annexed. As a result, currently Myszków covers a large area – it is the 139th most populated town of Poland, but the 50th in terms of territory.

==Geography==
Myszków occupies the area of , of which 56% is arable land, and 22% forests. Since 1925 it has been the seat of a gmina, but Myszków officially remained a village until 1950, when it received town charter. Today&#x27;s Myszków is made of a number of former villages, towns and settlements (&quot;Mrzygłód, Nowa Wieś, Pohulanka, Będusz, Helenówka, Myszków, Mijaczów, Ciszówka&quot;), which had existed here for centuries. The town is located on the elevation of 280 meters above sea level, in a valley between Silesian Highlands and Polish Jura, and some of its districts are part of the Jura Landscape Parks. Myszków is characteristic for its settlement type of architecture, which is the result of mergers of numerous villages into its borders.

<text>The , also known as the New Harbinger Party, was a political party in Japan that broke away from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on 22 June 1993. The party was created by Masayoshi Takemura. The party was centrist, and had many reformist and even moderate ecological elements. The theoretical leader was Shusei Tanaka. Yukio Hatoyama and Naoto Kan also took part but later moved to the Democratic Party of Japan.

==History==
After the 1993 general election, Sakigake joined a Cabinet led by Morihiro Hosokawa. It was the first government without the LDP since 1955. Sakigake&#x27;s Masayoshi Takemura became Minister. Sakigake supported the following Tsutomu Hata Cabinet, but didn&#x27;t join the Cabinet.

In 1994, New Party Sakigake took part in the government of Murayama Tomiichi, a government coalition of the LDP and the Japan Socialist Party, which replaced the coalition government headed the previous year by the Japan Renewal Party.

In September 1996, Sakigake and Japan Socialist Party politicians who did not support their respective parties alliances with the LDP broke away to found the Democratic Party of Japan.

The exodus of these liberal members moved the party further to the right. In 1997, the New Party Sakigake had two members in the House of Representatives and three members in the House of Councillors, which was good for them, especially after the LDP became the ruling party again. However, it decided to moderate its stance, and, because of the power of the ecologist and reformist factions, the conservatives decided to reform the party. As part of the ruling coalition in 1998, it had 2 seats in the House of Representatives and 3 in the House of Councillors. In October 1998, the party reformed itself with a more conservative image, dropping the &#x27;New&#x27; from its title to become simply the &quot;Sakigake Party&quot;.

Its popularity heavily declined after that, and by 2001, the party had no seats in either the Lower or Upper House. In 2002, the ecologists took control, and turned the party into an ecologist party. It changed its name to , the Environmental Green Political Assembly, which, because it won no seats in the 2004 Parliamentary elections, dissolved itself on 31 October 2004.

The party gained its followers mainly from white collar bureaucrats and ecologists. It was a conservative reformist party with ecological elements.

<text>Polkowice () is a town in south-western Poland. It is situated in Lower Silesian Voivodeship. The town is the seat of Polkowice County and of Gmina Polkowice.

==Geography==
Polkowice is located in historic Lower Silesia, about northwest of Lubin. The nearest airport is Wrocław Airport, located from Polkowice.

Situated in a traditional mining region, the town is part of the largest industrial copper-extraction area in Poland, with a copper-processing plant operating nearby. Nearby Polkowice Dolne is the site of a former State Agricultural Farm (PGR) and, since 1998, of a Volkswagen diesel engine plant, another major employer in the region.

Designated as an urban-type settlement from 1945, Polkowice regained town status in 1967. In 1975–1998 it was in the former Legnica Voivodeship.

==History==
The name of the town is probably derived from Slavic (Old Polish) &quot;Boleslaw&quot;, meaning &quot;great glory&quot;, a favoured dynastic name in the Polish royal House of Piast. According to legend, The Silesian duke Bolesław I the Tall (1127–1201) had a hunting lodge erected near the later town, later called &quot;Bolkewice&quot; or, adjusted to the German pronunciation, &quot;Polkovicz&quot; (1333). In the &quot;Statuta synodalia episcoporum Wratislaviensium&quot; from 1475 the town is named &quot;Polkewicze&quot; and &quot;Polkowice&quot;. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland into smaller duchies, it became part of the Duchy of Silesia, and later on the Duchy of Głogów. Polkowice was mentioned as a town (&quot;civitas&quot;) in a 1276 deed. It remained part of the Duchy of Głogów, ruled by the Polish houses of Piast and Jagiellon, including future Polish kings John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old, until the duchy&#x27;s dissolution in 1506, when it was incorporated into the Bohemian (Czech) Kingdom.

Parts of the medieval town were destroyed by a blaze in 1457, it suffered further damages during the Thirty Years&#x27; War and by a plague epidemic in 1680. After the First Silesian War in 1742, it was annexed by Prussia and later incorporated into the Province of Silesia. During the Napoleonic Wars, the town was visited by Napoleon twice, in 1807 and 1812. Between 1871 and 1945 the town was part of Germany and was renamed &quot;Heerwegen&quot; in 1937 by German Nazi authorities during a campaign of erasing placenames of Polish origin. During World War II, a German forced labour subcamp of the prison in Jawor was operated in the present-day district of Polkowice Dolne. On January 11, 1945, the German administration evacuated the population, leaving only the army in the town. On February 9, 1945, the town was captured by the Red Army. Afterwards the abandoned town became again part of Poland in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement and was repopulated by Poles, many displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

In 2005 the neighbouring village of Polkowice Dolne was included within the town limits.

<doc id="387060" wikidata="Q1979567" url="?curid=387060" title="New Frontier Party (Japan)">
<text>The (NFP) was a big tent political party in Japan founded in December 1994. As a merger of several small parties, the party was ideologically diverse, with its membership ranging from moderate social democrats to liberals and conservatives. The party dissolved in December 1997, with Ichirō Ozawa&#x27;s faction forming the Liberal Party and other splinters later joining the Democratic Party of Japan in April 1998.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===
The party was founded on 10 December 1994 by former member parties of the anti-Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) opposition coalition led by Morihiro Hosokawa who had resigned in April. During the formation of the succeeding Hata cabinet, several coalition parties formed a joint parliamentary group. But at the same time, the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) and the New Party Sakigake withdrew from the eight-party coalition and left Hata without majority. In June, the LDP returned to power by striking a &quot;grand&quot; coalition deal with the JSP under which the Socialists would receive the prime ministership. Hata resigned before an impending no-confidence vote submitted by the LDP: In less than a year, the anti-LDP coalition had broken down. After the electoral reform initiated by the anti-LDP coalition had been passed by the new LDP-JSP coalition in November 1994, the opposition parties negotiated on creating a unified force to contest the newly introduced First-past-the-post voting single-member electoral districts that now elect the majority of the House of Representatives: In December, the Japan Renewal Party, a part of Kōmeitō which had split a few days before, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the Japan New Party and the (&quot;Liberal Reform League&quot; a federation of several small groups of Diet members who had broken away from the LDP) formed the New Frontier Party, becoming the largest single party formed in post-war Japan other than the LDP.

=== Internal conflicts ===
On 8 December 1994, the Diet members of the future party elected former LDP Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu as leader, Kaifu received 131 votes, former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 52 and DSP leader Takashi Yonezawa 32 votes. In 1995, Kaifu was succeeded by Ichirō Ozawa who led the party from 1995 until its dissolution in 1997. Ozawa won the leadership election among party members and registered supporters (&quot;tōyū&quot;) in December 1995 with 1,120,012 votes against Tsutomu Hata who received 566,998 votes. Ozawa was reelected just a few days before the party dissolved in a vote among NFP Diet members and delegates from NFP prefectural federations in December 1997, defeating Michihiko Kano by 230 votes to 182.

The party held onto 156 seats in the 1996 general election, losing a net four seats and failing to attack the LDP-SDP government majority, but remaining the largest opposition party. Unlike the other major, nationwide parties (mainly LDP and DPJ, the SDP was already in the advanced stages of its decline to a micro-party), In 1996, Ozawa&#x27;s NFP made little use of the possibility to nominate dual candidates that stand in both the majoritarian and the proportional election at the same time under the new parallel electoral system. Thereby, the party lost a string of experienced politicians who were not &quot;insured&quot; by a dual candidacy on a proportional list. In total, more than 40 NFP incumbents who sought reelection lost their seats in 1996.

=== Dissolution and aftermath ===
After the New Frontier Party dissolved in 1997, its remnants collated into several small parties:
* The New Peace Party (&quot;Shintō Heiwa&quot;) and the &quot;Dawn Club&quot; (&quot;Reimei Club&quot;) of former Kōmeitō members, these merged later in 1998 with the still existing Kōmei to re-establish the (&quot;New&quot;) Kōmeitō,
* the Liberal Party of Ichirō Ozawa which later participated in a coalition with the LDP under Keizō Obuchi, but eventually merged into the Democratic Party in 2003,
* the (&quot;Kaikaku Club&quot;) of Tatsuo Ozawa that later joined the LDP-Liberal Party-Kōmeitō coalition,
* the New Fraternity Party (&quot;Shintō Yūai&quot;) of Kansei Nakano and
* the &quot;Voice of the People&quot; (&quot;Kokumin no Koe&quot;) of Michihiko Kano.
The latter two parties immediately joined the Democratic Party in one parliamentary group (then renamed 民主友愛太陽国民連合, &quot;Minshu Yūai Taiyō Kokumin Rengō&quot;, &quot;Democratic Fraternity Sun People&#x27;s League&quot;, abbreviated as 民友連, &quot;Min&#x27;yūren&quot;). They were joined by two parties who had broken away from the NFP earlier – the Sun Party of Tsutomu Hata in 1996 and the From Five of Morihiro Hosokawa in 1997 – and another party from the former anti-LDP coalition that hadn&#x27;t joined the NFP: the &quot;Minshu Kaikaku Rengō&quot; (&quot;Democratic Reform League&quot;). The joint parliamentary group gave the DPJ the role of leading the opposition in the Diet. Three member parties together formed the Minseitō (&quot;Democratic&quot; or &quot;Good Governance Party&quot;) a few weeks later. All member parties of the parliamentary group eventually merged with the Democratic Party to form the (&quot;New&quot;) Democratic Party of Japan in April 1998.

== Ideology ==
In terms of policy, the New Frontier Party took a hawkish position on foreign, security policy and related constitutional matters (which had been the main dividing line between political left and right in the 1955 System) similar to the LDP, but pushed for more deregulation, decentralization and political reform. It thereby tried to attract disgruntled LDP voters who would seek for new answers to the political challenges posed in the wake of the burst bubble economy and by the dawning demographic transition. In contrast, the Democratic Party of Japan that was formed two years later to provide an alternative to the old LDP and the Ozawa-dominated NFP, took a similar stance to the NFP on economic reform, but a more dovish position on foreign policy, thereby also becoming appealing to traditional JSP voters.

<text>The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) is a translation of the Bible in American English. It was first published in 1989 by the National Council of Churches, the NRSV was created by an ecumenical committee of scholars &quot;comprising about thirty members&quot;. The NRSV relies on recently published critical editions of the original Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts. A major revision, the New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition (NRSVue), was released in 2021.

Used broadly among biblical scholars, the NRSV was intended as a translation to serve the devotional, liturgical, and scholarly needs of the broadest possible range of Christian religious adherents.

The tradition of the King James Version has been continued in the Revised Standard Version and in the New Revised Standard Version. The full 84 book translation includes the Protestant enumeration of the Old Testament, the Apocrypha, and the New Testament; another version of the NRSV includes the deuterocanonical books as part of the Old Testament, which is normative in the canon of Roman Catholicism, along with the New Testament (totalling 73 books).

The translation appears in three main formats: (1) an edition including the Protestant enumeration of the Old Testament, the Apocrypha, and the New Testament (as well an edition that only includes the Protestant enumeration of the Old Testament and New Testament); (2) a Roman Catholic Edition with all the books of that canon in their customary order, and (3) the Common Bible, which includes the books that appear in Protestant, Catholic, and Eastern Orthodox canons (but not additional books from Oriental Orthodox traditions, including the Syriac and Ethiopian canons). A special edition of the NRSV, called the &quot;Anglicized Edition&quot;, employs British English spelling and grammar instead of American English.

== History ==
The New Revised Standard Version was translated by the Division of Christian Education (now Bible Translation and Utilization) of the National Council of Churches in the United States. The group included scholars representing Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant Christian groups as well as Jewish representation in the group responsible for the Hebrew Scriptures or Old Testament. The mandate given the committee was summarized in a dictum: &quot;As literal as possible, as free as necessary.&quot;

== Principles of revision ==
=== Improved manuscripts and translations ===
The Old Testament translation of the RSV was completed before the Dead Sea Scrolls were available to scholars. The NRSV was intended to take advantage of this and other manuscript discoveries, and to reflect advances in scholarship.

=== Gender language ===
In the preface to the NRSV Bruce Metzger wrote for the committee that &quot;many in the churches have become sensitive to the danger of linguistic sexism arising from the inherent bias of the English language towards the masculine gender, a bias that in the case of the Bible has often restricted or obscured the meaning of the original text&quot;. The RSV observed the older convention of using masculine nouns in a gender-neutral sense (e.g., &quot;man&quot; instead of &quot;person&quot;), and in some cases used a masculine word where the source language used a neutral word. This move has been widely criticised by some, including within the Catholic Church, and continues to be a point of contention today. The NRSV by contrast adopted a policy of inclusiveness in gender language. According to Metzger, &quot;The mandates from the Division specified that, in references to men and women, masculine-oriented language should be eliminated as far as this can be done without altering passages that reflect the historical situation of ancient patriarchal culture.&quot;

== Reception ==
Many mainline Protestant churches officially approve the NRSV for both private and public use. The Episcopal Church (United States) in Canon II.2 added the NRSV to the list of translations approved for church services. It is also widely used by the United Methodist Church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Presbyterian Church (USA), the Presbyterian Church in Canada, the United Church of Christ, the Reformed Church in America, the United Church of Canada, and the Uniting Church in Australia.

In accordance with the 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 825.1, the NRSV with the deuterocanonical books received the Imprimatur of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, meaning that the NRSV (Catholic Edition) is officially approved by the Catholic Church and can be profitably used by Catholics in private study and devotional reading. The New Revised Standard Version, Catholic Edition also has the imprimatur, granted on 12 September 1991 and 15 October 1991, respectively. For public worship, such as at weekly Mass, most Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conferences in English-speaking countries require the use of other translations, either the adapted New American Bible in the dioceses of the United States and the Philippines or the English Standard Version and Revised New Jerusalem Bible in most of the rest of the English-speaking world. However, the Canadian conference and the Vatican approved a modification of the NRSV for lectionary use in 2008. The NRSV, along with the Revised Standard Version, is also quoted in several places in the English-language edition of the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;, the latter of which summarizes Catholic doctrine and belief in written form.

In 1990 the synod of the Orthodox Church in America decided not to permit use of the NRSV in liturgy or in Bible studies on the grounds that it is highly &quot;divergent from the Holy Scriptures traditionally read aloud in the sacred services of the Church.&quot;

== NRSV Catholic Edition (NRSV-CE) ==
The New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (NRSV-CE) is an edition of the NRSV for Catholics. It contains all the canonical books of Scripture accepted by the Catholic Church arranged in the traditional Catholic order. Because of the presence of Catholic scholars on the original NRSV translation team, no other changes to the text were needed.

An Anglicized Text form of the NRSV-CE, embodying the preferences of users of British English, is also available from various publishers.

=== Liturgical use and approval ===
The NRSV-CE received the imprimatur of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1991, granting official approval for Catholic use in private study and devotional reading.

In 2007, the Canadian conference and the Vatican approved a modification of the NRSV for lectionary use beginning the following year. The NRSV-CE, along with the Revised Standard Version (RSV), is also one of the texts adapted and quoted in the English-language edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

== NRSV Updated Edition (NRSVue) ==
The New Revised Standard Version Updated Edition (NRSVue) is a major revision of the NRSV. A three-year process of reviewing and updating the text of the NRSV was announced at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature. The update was managed by the SBL following an agreement with the copyright-holding NCC. The stated focuses of the review are incorporating advances in textual criticism since the 1989 publication of the NRSV, improving the textual notes, and reviewing the style and rendering of the translation. A team of more than fifty scholars, led by an editorial board, is responsible for the review. It was released for digital purchase on December 25, 2021, with the first print editions following in 2022. As of July 2024, the NCC has submitted the NRSVue for review by United States Conference of Catholic Bishops with a request for an imprimatur.

<doc id="387063" wikidata="Q234077" url="?curid=387063" title="Dwarf elliptical galaxy">
<text>Dwarf elliptical galaxies (dEs) are elliptical galaxies that are smaller than ordinary elliptical galaxies. They are quite common in galaxy groups and clusters, and are usually companions to other galaxies.

== Examples ==
&quot;Dwarf elliptical&quot; galaxies should not be confused with the rare &quot;compact elliptical&quot; galaxy class, of which M32, a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy, is the prototype.
In 1944 Walter Baade confirmed dwarf ellipticals NGC 147 and NGC 185 as members of the Local Group by resolving them into individual stars, thanks to their relatively little distance. In the 1950s, dEs were also discovered in the nearby Fornax and Virgo clusters.

== Relation to other elliptical galaxy types ==
Dwarf elliptical galaxies have blue absolute magnitudes within the range fainter than ordinary elliptical galaxies.

The surface brightness profiles of ordinary elliptical galaxies was formerly approximated using &quot;de Vaucouleur&#x27;s model&quot;, while dEs were approximated with an exponentially declining surface brightness profile. However, both types fit well by a more general function, known as &quot;Sersic&#x27;s model&quot;, and there is a continuity of &quot;Sersic index&quot; (which quantifies the shape of the surface brightness profile) as a function of galaxy luminosity. This is interpreted as showing that dwarf elliptical and ordinary elliptical galaxies belong to a single sequence.

An even-fainter type of elliptical-like galaxies, called dwarf spheroidal galaxies, may be a genuinely distinct class.

== Origins ==
Dwarf ellipticals may be primordial objects. Within the currently favoured cosmological Lambda-CDM model, small objects (consisting of dark matter and gas) were the first to form. Because of their mutual gravitational attraction, some of these will coalesce and merge, forming more massive objects. Further mergers lead to ever more massive objects.
The process of coalescence could lead to the present-day galaxies, and has been called &quot;hierarchical merging&quot;. If this hypothesis is correct, dwarf galaxies may be the building blocks of today&#x27;s large spiral galaxies, which in turn are thought to merge to form giant ellipticals. 

An alternative suggestion is that dEs could be the remnants of low-mass spiral galaxies that obtained a rounder shape through the action of repeated gravitational interactions with ordinary galaxies within a cluster. This process of changing a galaxy&#x27;s morphology by interactions, and the removal of much of its stellar disk, has been called &quot;galaxy harassment&quot;. Evidence for this latter hypothesis has been claimed due to stellar disks and weak spiral arms seen in some dEs. Under this alternative hypothesis, the anaemic spiral arms and disk are a modified version of the original stellar disk of the now transformed spiral galaxy.

At the same time, the galaxy harassment scenario can not be the full picture. The highly isolated dwarf elliptical galaxy CG 611 possesses the same physical attributes as dE galaxies in clusters – such as coherent rotation and faint spiral arms – attributes that were previously assumed to provide evidence that dE galaxies were once spiral galaxies prior to a transformation process requiring immersion with a cluster of galaxies. CG 611 has a gas disk which counter-rotates to its stellar disk, clearly revealing that this dE galaxy&#x27;s disk is growing via accretion events. If CG 611 was to fall into a galaxy cluster, ram-pressure stripping by the cluster&#x27;s halo of hot X-ray gas would strip away CG 611&#x27;s gas disk and leave a gas-poor dE galaxy that immediately resembles the other dEs in the cluster. That is, no removal of stars nor re-shaping of the galaxy within the dense galaxy cluster environment would be required, undermining the idea that dE galaxies were once spiral galaxies.

<text>Agencia EFE, S.A. () is a Spanish international news agency, the major Spanish-language multimedia news agency and the world&#x27;s fourth largest wire service after the Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse. EFE was created in 1939 by Ramón Serrano Súñer, then Francoist faction&#x27;s Interior Minister.

Agencia EFE is a news agency that covers all areas of information in the news media of the press, radio, television and Internet. It distributes around three million news items per year, thanks to its 3,000 journalists from 60 nationalities, operating 24 hours per day from more than 180 cities in 120 countries and with four editorial desks in three continents: Madrid, Bogotá, Cairo (Arabic), and Rio de Janeiro (Portuguese).

==History==
===Background===
The agency dates back to 1865, when the «Correspondents Center» was created – the first news agency in Spain – and promoted by journalist Nilo María Fabra. In 1870 a cooperation agreement was signed with the French agency Havas. With this agreement, the &quot;Corresponsales Center&quot; reserved the distribution rights in Spain of Havas&#x27; international news.

In 1919 the Fabra news agency was created, when Havas became part of the shareholding of the &quot;Correspondents Center&quot;. Havas withdrew from the shareholding in 1926 at the same time that the Central Bank (a private entity), Santander Bank and Hispanic-American Bank entered into the partnership (these three banks merged at the end of the 20th century into Banco Santander Central Hispano).

===Foundation and early years===
EFE was officially founded in the city of Burgos in 1939. The city of Burgos was the headquarters of dictator Francisco Franco. Its founder, Interior Minister Ramón Serrano Suñer, brother-in-law of Franco asked journalist Vicente Gallego (first director of the extinct &quot;Ya&quot; newspaper) to initiate the project.

On 3 January 1939, the Marquis of Torrehoyos Celedonio de Noriega Ruiz and journalist Luis Amato de Ibarrola – both legal representatives of the Fabra agency – declared before the notary José María Hortelano, that they have agreed to set up a commercial company of an anonymous nature, with the name of &quot;Agencia EFE S.A.&quot; The Fabra agency contributed with its rights and its name. In this way, the new agency could be admitted to the Club of the Allied Agencies, constituted at that time by some thirty agencies and whose statutes stipulated that only one agency per country could be a member of the association. In addition to the acquisition of Fabra Agency shares by the new agency, technical and human resources from the defunct Faro and Febus agencies were incorporated.

===Controversy over the origin of the name===
On the grounds of the denomination &quot;EFE&quot; there is controversy. Contrary to some popular belief, it is not an acronym. The former president and director of the agency Luis María Anson said in an article published in the Ya newspaper that the name of EFE (pronunciation of letter F in Spanish) was due to the participation of the old agencies Fabra, Febus and Faro in the new agency.

However, Ramón Serrano Suñer acknowledged in a letter sent to Antonio Herrero Losada, director of the news agency Europa Press, that the EFE agency was named in this way because &quot;F was the initial letter of &quot;Falange y de Fe&quot; (), which was the combat newspaper of the Falange&quot;. He also added that &quot;there was no mention that it was also a reason for the name of EFE that this letter was Franco&#x27;s initial. This would come later.&quot;

Herrero Losada, linked to the Fabra agency, denied Ansón recalling that since 1938, in the middle of a civil war, EFE was transmitting news to the media on the Francoist side, where editors of the Fabra agency were being persecuted for their activity. Previously, and another one of those mentioned, Febus, continued his informative service in the republican sector. For his part, José Antonio Giménez Arnáu assured that it was he who provided Serrano Suñer with the idea of creating the agency and drafted its statutes, that EFE had nothing to do with the initial of the Falange or Franco, since according to some sources it occupied the building of the &quot;Spanish Falange Editorial&quot; (), from whose initials it took the name, and that it had a proof that will only be known after its death something that happened three years after the controversy without any revelation.

===First headquarters and services===
The first headquarters of Agencia EFE was installed on a floor of a modern building of six heights, inaugurated the previous year, which currently corresponds to number 10 -the 9th in the old numbering- of Victoria Street, Burgos. Its first President was Celedonio Noriega, Marquis of Torrehoyos and its first Managing Director Vicente Gállego Castro.

In 1940, EFE moved its headquarters to a house at number 5 on Ayala Street in Madrid and opened a delegation in Barcelona. The same year Jesús Pabón replaced Noriega as president and four years later, in 1944, the then-Deputy-Director Pedro Gómez Aparicio replaced Vicente Gállego in the direction of the agency.

In 1946, the Comtelsa economic service was created in collaboration, at 50%, with the British agency Reuters. It is known that, at least since this same year, Federico Vélez González, famous and prestigious photographer from Burgos, has been working as a graphic correspondent.

In 1951, EFE installed its first telephotography receiver. In 1958 Gómez Aparicio was replaced in his position by Manuel Aznar Zubigaray, who left office 2 years later. The direction was assumed by the president and the executives of the company for 3 years, until in 1963 the journalist and correspondent abroad, Carlos Sentís, was appointed Managing Director.

===1960s to 1980s: Internationalization===
In 1965 the Buenos Aires delegation opened, the first delegation for the Americas and the next year started the foreign informative service to distribute news through Ibero-America and more delegations were open in other South American countries. In 1967, Miguel Mateu Pla was appointed EFE President. In September of the following year Manuel Aznar took care of the presidency and in 1969 Alexander Armesto was appointed Managing Director.

In 1968, EFE acquired the Fiel news agency and in 1969 started small news services in English and French. In 1972, EFE joined forces with several Central American media to create the Central American News Agency (ACAN), based in Panama. Its expansion through the Americas took Agencia EFE in 1979 to enter like a full member in the Inter American Press Association.

In February 1976, José María Alfaro Polanco was named president of EFE and in September the presidency was assumed by Luis María Anson, who was also Director-General. That same year the first Stylebook of Agencia EFE for the homogeneous writing of the information services of all the world is published, under the direction and advising of the professor and academic Fernando Lázaro Carreter.

In 1977, EFE moved its headquarters to number 32 Espronceda Street, Madrid. That same year, all the information services of the agency went on to use the name EFE, which until then was reserved for international information, so that the division of Cifra, Cifra-Gráfica and Alfil disappeared. That same year, the EFE Journalism Awards were also created, which in 1983 were replaced by the King of Spain Awards.

In 1981, EFE and the Institute for Ibero-American Cooperation created the Department of Urgent Spanish (DEU) with the participation of philologists and prominent academics of the language, with the mission of ensuring the correct use of Spanish in its information services. In 1983, journalist Ricardo Utrilla was appointed President and CEO and an agreement was signed with the US agency UPI to promote the Radio department. The services &quot;Great Signatures&quot; and &quot;End of Century Chronicles&quot; were also created to distribute articles of outstanding intellectuals in Spain and Latin America.

In 1984, EFE formally joined the European Pressphoto Agency (EPA), the first European telephotography agency, with 20% of the company&#x27;s capital. In 1986, EFE changed its logo and journalist Alfonso Sobrado Palomares was appointed Chairman and CEO ().

In 1988, the EFE Data service was launched, the first Spanish news data bank, and in March of that same year the EFE Foundation was created to promote research, development and study of information and technology, as well as the granting of training scholarships for students in any of the branches of Information Sciences. In 1989, EFE began distributing its information services to its customers via satellites. This same year the 50th anniversary of the Agencia EFE was celebrated with an itinerant graphic exhibition called &quot;Ephemerides&quot;. The Press Association of Madrid awarded the Rodríguez Santamaría Award to EFE for its work.

=== 1990s and 21st century ===
Since the 1990s, subsidiaries were created for specific topics. In 1990, the subsidiaries Efeagro (food industry) and Efecom (business) were created, in 1994 Euroefe (EU news - Euractiv) was created and in 2010 Efeverde (environment). In 2013, Efefuturo (science and technology), Efesalud (health), Efe-empresas (business), Efemotor (transport) and Efetur (tourism) were launched. Among them, Efeverde stands out as the most awarded subsidiary for its informative transparency. Efeverde has its own guide for environmental journalists and was one of the first subsidiaries to establish a broad presence in social networks. Since 2011 it has also Android, iPhone and iPad apps.

Achievement awards were also established. In 1990 EFE gave the first Silver Ball Award to the best Ibero-American football player and in 1998 together with UNICEF, they created the Ibero-American Communication Awards for the Rights of Children and Adolescents. In 2004, the Don Quixote Journalism Award was created, which is presented at the same time as the King of Spain Award.

In 1995, EFE was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Communication and Humanities in recognition of its work, independence and neutrality. It shared the award with the philosopher José Luis López Aranguren. In 1996, Miguel Ángel Gozalo was named President-Director-General of EFE.

In 1998, the agency&#x27;s photo library began to function as a digital photographic archive. In 2000, the commercialization and digitization of graphic and press archives began and the Intranet &quot;Entre Nosotros&quot; (Among us) was created. In 2003, the International Graphic Service (SGI) was launched in partnership with EPA and the Multimedia Coordination Unit was inaugurated in Madrid.

In 2001, a service was launched in Portuguese for Brazil. Likewise, that year EFE was transferred from the Directorate-General for State Property of the Ministry of the Treasury to the public holding SEPI. In 2002, an editing center was created in Miami that facilitates the adaptation of the information content to the American market.

In 2004, Álex Grijelmo was named president of EFE, the journalist of the Arturo Larena agency won the National Environment Award in the form of Journalism. That same year the subsidiary ACAN-EFE (the service for Central America) was integrated into EFE.

In 2006, EFE changed its logo and the first Statute of the EFE Editorial Board was approved. In 2007, the Americas Editorial Board moved from Miami to Bogotá, aimed at product integration. In 2008, the EFE-Galicia news service in Galician was launched from Santiago de Compostela.

In March 2012, journalist José Antonio Vera Gil was appointed the new president of EFE to replace Álex Grijelmo.

In 2014, the agency moved to a new headquarters, inaugurated by the Prince and Princess of Asturias, in the Burgos Avenue of the city of Madrid. That year, the 75th anniversary of the agency took place. The Kings inaugurated the great commemorative exhibition of the 75th anniversary of EFE. On the occasion of this commemoration were held more than 30 traveling exhibitions in Spain and the Americas and the Congresses of the European News Agencies (EANA) and Mobile Information and News Data Services (MINDS) in Madrid, as well as the News Agencies of the Mediterranean (AMAN) in Alicante. Seminars were also given in El Escorial and Santander.

In 2015, Fundéu celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation. EFE increased its participation in the European Pressphoto Agency up to 49.9%. EFEAgro celebrated 25 years of its existence. It was held an exhibition of EFE in Buenos Aires and Caracas during the 50 years of EFE in the Americas. The 3rd anniversary of EFEsalud was also celebrated in 2015.

In 2016, an exposition was held in Lima for the 50 years of EFE in Peru. The EFE Museum was inaugurated by the Acting Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy. In July, the news agency and its president were awarded with the Eisenhower Award. In 2017, the EFE-EPA multimedia service in English for Asia began to function. The News 4 Europe line was put into service with EFE, EPA and ten other European news agencies.

In 2018, the State General Budget recognized for the first time the budget of EFE as a Service of General Economic Interest, increasing the public endowment of the agency. In July, journalist Fernando Garea was named the new president of EFE to replace José Antonio Vera Gil.

== Urgent Spanish Department ==
In 1980 the Department of Urgent Spanish was created to combine criteria and norms, as well as to avoid linguistic dispersion and the indiscriminate use of neologisms in Spanish. The department is made up of linguists and philologists together with the Style Advisory Council, composed of members of the Spanish Royal Academy, professors of Philology and journalists. Its main tool is the Urgent Spanish Manual (MEU), the Agencia EFE style manual, which is a very popular Spanish user manual. It began to be published in 1976.

In 2005, the Urgent Spanish Department was replaced by the Urgent Spanish Foundation, commonly known as Fundéu BBVA.

<doc id="387073" wikidata="Q4899214" url="?curid=387073" title="Between you and I">
<text>&quot;Between you and I&quot; is an English phrase that has drawn considerable interest from linguists, grammarians, and stylists. It is commonly used by style guides as a convenient label for a construction where the nominative/subjective form of pronouns is used for two pronouns joined by &quot;and&quot; in circumstances where the accusative/oblique case would be used for a single pronoun, typically following a preposition, but also as the object of a transitive verb.
One frequently cited use of the phrase occurs in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1596–98). 
According to many style guides, the Shakespearian character who used the phrase should have written &quot;between you and me&quot;.
Use of this common construction has been described as &quot;a grammatical error of &quot;unsurpassable&quot; grossness&quot;, although whether it is (or was) in fact an error is a matter of debate.

==Use in literature ==
&quot;Between you and I&quot; occurs in act 3, scene 2, of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, in a letter written in prose by Antonio, the titular character, to his friend Bassanio: &quot;Sweet Bassanio, ... all debts are cleared between you and I if I might but see you at my death.&quot;

Writer and critic Henry Hitchings points to usage in William Congreve&#x27;s &quot;The Double Dealer&quot; (1693) and in Mark Twain&#x27;s letters. Otto Jespersen found similar examples (&quot;pronouns or nouns plus &quot;I&quot; after a preposition&quot;, in Robert J. Menner&#x27;s words) in Ben Jonson, John Bunyan, Charles Dickens, and Graham Greene, and Menner adds Noah Webster, Samuel Pepys, Thomas Middleton, and others. Writer Constance Hale notes that Ernest Hemingway frequently used pronouns this way: &quot;Gertrude Stein and me are just like brothers.&quot;

Various critics have commented on Shakespeare&#x27;s line. American writer Russell Baker, in his &quot;Observer&quot; column in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, considered it a grammatical error—&quot;grammatically, of course, Shakespeare was wrong&quot;. He said Shakespeare probably &quot;slipped accidentally&quot;: &quot;My guess is that he was writing along rapidly, maybe at the end of the day when he was tired, was wishing he&#x27;d never come up with this &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; idea, and eager to get over to the Mermaid Tavern for a beer with Jonson and Burbage&quot;. Menner, in a 1937 article in &quot;American Speech&quot;, says that &quot;it is evident that the phrase &quot;you and I&quot; was often felt to be grammatically indivisible, perhaps of frequency, and that we &quot;cannot even be sure that &#x27;between you and I&#x27; was originally hypercorrect in the Elizabethan age&quot;; Menner does not say whether he believes the usage to be correct or incorrect.

Others do not accuse Shakespeare of grammatical incorrectness: sociologist Robert Nisbet criticizes &quot;word snobs&quot; who condemn the phrase, and lexicographer and OED editor Robert Burchfield states that what is incorrect for us was not necessarily incorrect for Shakespeare: &quot;grammatical assumptions were different then&quot;, a view shared by philologist and grammarian Henry Sweet. However, Bryan A. Garner, who writes on usage and (especially legal) language, writes that even if the phrase was not incorrect for Shakespeare, it is and should be considered incorrect today, and cites linguist Randolph Quirk: &quot;It is true that Shakespeare used both [&#x27;between you and I&#x27; as well as &#x27;between you and me&#x27;], but that did not make it any more correct&quot;.

==Incorrectness and hypercorrection==
The term &quot;hypercorrection&quot;, in this context, refers to grammatically incorrect usage, and is typically committed by speakers (or writers) who &quot;overcorrect&quot; what they think is a mistake, and thereby commit an error. Kenneth G. Wilson, author of &quot;The Columbia Guide to Standard American English&quot; (1993), says hypercorrections are &quot;the new mistakes we make in the effort to avoid old ones&quot;, and cites &quot;between you and I&quot; as an example—better, he says, to say &quot;between the two of us&quot;.

For the phrase to be considered an example of hypercorrection, it has to be considered grammatically incorrect in the first place. Grammarians and writers on style who judge the phrase this way include Paul Brians, the Oxford Dictionaries, and Grammar Girl: &quot;it&#x27;s just a rule that pronouns following prepositions in those phrases are always in the objective case.&quot; A BBC survey from the early 2000s found that listeners ranked &quot;between you and I&quot; first in &quot;most annoying grammar mistakes&quot;. But many grammarians and linguists, including Steven Pinker, consider the phrase grammatically acceptable.

===Supposed causes===
The cause for this particular error is given by such authorities as a kind of trauma deriving from incorrect usage caused by &quot;you&quot; being both nominative and oblique, and the awareness of the possible incorrectness of &quot;me&quot;: &quot;People make this mistake because they know it&#x27;s not correct to say, for example, &#x27;John and me went to the shops&#x27;. They know that the correct sentence would be &#x27;John and I went to the shops&#x27;. But they then mistakenly assume that the words &#x27;and me&#x27; should be replaced by &#x27;and I&#x27; in all cases.&quot; In &quot;The Language Wars&quot; (2011), Henry Hitchings provides a similar explanation, adding that for many speakers &quot;you and I&quot; seem to belong together, which is noted also by Kenneth Wilson. That the problem typically occurs when two pronouns are used together is widely recognized: &quot;these problems rarely arise when the pronoun [I] stands alone&quot;. James Cochrane, author of &quot;Between You and I: A Little Book of Bad English&quot; (2004), gives a similar explanation—in this case, &quot;people&quot;&#x27;s feeling some unease with a sentence like &quot;Me and Bill went out for beers&quot;; Cochrane does not, however, mark it as a hypercorrection, and suggests the phrase only came about &quot;in the last twenty or so years&quot;—linguist J. K. Chambers, however, points out that the usage is not &quot;a change in progress&quot;.

J. K. Chambers investigated the phrase (as well as the closely related &quot;with you and I&quot;) in an analysis of the role of education in the grammaticality of English speakers, in this case from Canada. Data from ninth-graders and their parents indicated little regional variation, but a significant variation between children and their parents, showing children were more likely to pick the &quot;correct&quot; pronoun or, in technical terms, to show &quot;accusative case concord with conjoined pronouns&quot;. Chambers&#x27;s explanation is that the children are likely to have had better education than their parents, and a study from 2008 of seven regions across Canada likewise showed that concord increased as the level of education increased. Chambers investigates a number of explanations offered, and accepts as one reason that the mistake occurs because of the considerable distance between the preposition and the second pronoun.

===Hypercorrection, contextual acceptability===
More complex explanations than &quot;trauma&quot; or &quot;unease&quot; are provided by linguists and sociolinguists. Without expanding on the topic, Henry Hitchings considers the phrase a very specific, class-oriented kind of hypercorrection, which he calls &quot;hyperurbanism&quot;, which &quot;involves avoiding what is believed to be a &#x27;low&#x27; mistake and using a supposedly classier word or pronunciation, although in fact the result is nothing of the sort&quot;. A similar reason is given by Bryan Garner (&quot;pace&quot; Chambers), who says &quot;this grammatical error is committed almost exclusively by educated speakers trying a little too hard to sound refined but stumbling badly&quot;, and says the phrase is &quot;appallingly common&quot;. The notion that educated people are prone to this error is shared by Grammar Girl, who says that Jessica Simpson can therefore be forgiven (for the 2006 song &quot;Between You and I&quot;). According to legal scholar Patricia J. Williams, however, members of &quot;the real upper class&quot; recognize it immediately as substandard; she comments that such usage easily marks one as belonging to a lower class. Sociolinguist Gerard van Herk discusses &quot;between you and I&quot; and similar phrases with pronoun errors (which are all incorrect according to prescriptive linguists) in the context of social mobility.

One of the most notable linguists to accept the grammaticality of &quot;between you and I&quot; is Steven Pinker, even though he still calls it a &quot;hyper-corrected solecism&quot;. Pinker&#x27;s argument, in short, is that individual elements in coordinates need not have the same number as the coordinate itself: &quot;she and Jennifer are&quot; has two singular coordinates, though the coordination itself is plural. The same, Pinker argues in &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; (1994), applies to case, citing a famous phrase used by Bill Clinton and criticized by William Safire: &quot;So just because [Al Gore and I] is an object that requires object case, it does not mean that [I] is an object that requires object case. By the logic of grammar, the pronoun is free to have any case it wants&quot;. Writer Ben Yagoda, impressed by this argument, divides his thinking on the phrase&#x27;s grammaticality in a pre-Pinker and a post-Pinker period, and Peter Brodie, in a special issue of &quot;The English Journal&quot; devoted to grammar and usage, is likewise persuaded: &quot;he also reminds us that these rules are generally dictated by snobbery and conceived as mere shibboleths&quot;. While David D. Mulroy, in &quot;The War Against Grammar&quot; (2003), finds Pinker&#x27;s argument not entirely persuasive, he says &quot;these are matters on which reasonable people can disagree&quot;.

According to linguist Joshua Fishman the phrase is, in some circles, &quot;considered to be perfectly OK even in print&quot;, while others accept it &quot;only in some contexts&quot;, and yet others never accept it at all. Richard Redfern cites many examples of what is considered incorrect pronoun usage, many of which do not follow the &quot;preposition + you and I&quot; construction: &quot;for he and I&quot;, &quot;between he and Mr. Bittman&quot;. He argues that the &quot;error&quot; is widespread (Elizabeth II even committing it), and that it should become acceptable usage: &quot;The rule asks native speakers of English to stifle their instinctive way of expressing themselves&quot;.

In its treatment of &quot;coordinate nominatives&quot; used where the accusative (oblique) case would be used in non-coordinate constructions, &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; differentiates different levels of acceptance, depending on the pronouns used and their position in the coordinate construction. Thus, a construction like &quot;without you or I knowing anything about it&quot; is &quot;so common in speech and used by so broad a range of speakers that it has to be recognised as a variety of Standard English&quot;, while examples like &quot;they&#x27;ve awarded he and his brother certificates of merit&quot; and &quot;... return the key to you or she&quot; are classified as grammatically incorrect hypercorrection.

<doc id="387075" wikidata="Q832330" url="?curid=387075" title="Martín Fierro">
<text>Martín Fierro, also known as El Gaucho Martín Fierro, is a 2,316-line epic poem by the Argentine writer José Hernández. The poem was originally published in two parts, &quot;El Gaucho Martín Fierro&quot; (1872) and &quot;La Vuelta de Martín Fierro&quot; (1879). The poem supplied a historical link to the gauchos&#x27; contribution to the national development of Argentina, for the gaucho had played a major role in Argentina&#x27;s independence from Spain.

The poem, written in a Spanish that evokes rural Argentina, is widely seen as the pinnacle of the genre of &quot;gauchesque&quot; poetry (poems centered on the life of the gaucho, written in a style known as &quot;payadas&quot;) and a touchstone of Argentine national identity. It has appeared in hundreds of editions and has been translated into over 70 languages.

&quot;Martín Fierro&quot; has earned major praise and commentaries from Leopoldo Lugones, Miguel de Unamuno, Jorge Luis Borges (see also Borges on Martín Fierro) and Rafael Squirru, among others. The Martín Fierro Award, named after the poem, is the most respected award for Argentine television and radio programs.

==Plot==

===El Gaucho Martín Fierro===
In &quot;El Gaucho Martín Fierro&quot;, the eponymous protagonist is an impoverished Gaucho named Martín Fierro who has been drafted to serve at a border fort, defending the Argentine inner frontier against the native people. His life of poverty on the &quot;pampas&quot; is somewhat romanticized; his military experiences are not. He deserts and tries to return to his home, but discovers that his house, farm, and family are gone. He deliberately provokes an affair of honor by insulting a black woman in a bar. In the knife duel that ensues, he kills her male companion. The narration of another knife fight suggests, by its lack of detail, that it is one of many. Fierro becomes an outlaw pursued by the police militia. In a battle with them, he acquires a companion: Sergeant Cruz, inspired by Fierro&#x27;s bravery in resistance, defects and joins him mid-battle. The two set out to live among the natives, hoping to find a better life there.

===La Vuelta de Martín Fierro===

In &quot;La Vuelta de Martín Fierro&quot; (released in 1879), we discover that their hope of a better life is promptly and bitterly dashed. They are taken for spies; the &quot;cacique&quot; (chieftain) saves their lives, but they are effectively prisoners of the natives. In this context Hernández presents another, and very unsentimentalized, version of rural life. The poem narrates an epidemic, the horrible, expiatory attempts at cure, and the fatal wrath upon those, including a young &quot;Christian&quot; boy, suspected of bringing the plague. Both Cruz and the &quot;cacique&quot; die of the disease. Shortly afterward, at Cruz&#x27;s grave, Fierro hears the anguished cries of a woman. He follows and encounters a criolla weeping over the body of her dead son, her hands tied with the boy&#x27;s entrails. She had been accused of witchcraft. Fierro fights and wins a brutal battle with her captor and travels with her back towards civilization.

After Fierro leaves the woman at the first ranch they see, he goes on to an encounter that raises the story from the level of the mildly naturalistic to the mythic. He encounters his two surviving sons (one has been a prisoner, the other the ward of the vile and wily Vizcacha), and the son of Cruz (who has become a gambler). He has a night-long &quot;payada&quot; (singing duel) with a black &quot;payador&quot; (singer), who turns out to be the younger brother of the man Fierro murdered in a duel. At the end, Fierro speaks of changing his name and living in peace, but it is not entirely clear that the duel has been avoided (Borges wrote a short story (&quot;El Fin&quot;) in which this possibility is played out).

==Style and structure==
Like his predecessors in &quot;gauchesque&quot; poetry, Hernández sticks to the eight-syllable line of the &quot;payadas&quot;, the rural ballads. However, Hernández also uses a rhyming six-line stanza (&quot;like the six strings of a guitar&quot;, said Lugones) with a novel invention. The first line is kept &quot;free&quot; and unrhymed, allowing Hernández to present a &quot;thesis&quot; to the stanza without having to worry about the last word being part of the rhyme scheme. Lines two, three and six rhyme together while lines four and five constitute an independent rhyming group. The first verse of the poem illustrates this structure of six eight-syllable lines. (Note that, in Spanish prosody, vowels from adjacent words are considered to conjoin and form a single syllable, as marked here with a diagonal slash /, and verses ending in a stressed syllable behave as if they had an additional syllable at the end, marked with (+) .)

 1 A- quí me pon- go/a can- tar (+) Aquí me pongo a cantar
 2 al com- pás de la vi- güe- la, Al compás de la vigüela
 3 que/al hom- bre que lo des- ve- la Que al hombre que lo desvela
 4 u- na pe- na/es- tror- di- na- ria, Una pena estrordinaria,
 5 co- mo la/a- ve so- li- ta- ria Como la ave solitaria
 6 con el can- tar se con- sue- la. Con el cantar se consuela.
Unlike his predecessors, Hernández, who had himself spent half his life alongside the gauchos in the pampas, in the regular army brigades that took part in Argentina&#x27;s civil wars and more years engaged in the border wars, does not seek out every rural colloquialism under the sun. He hews much closer to the actual &quot;payadores&quot;, using a mildly archaic style and giving a sense of place more through phonetic spellings than through choice of words. At times - especially in the &quot;payadas&quot; within the larger poem - he rises to a particularly stark and powerful poetry, taking on romantic and even metaphysical themes. In &quot;La Vuelta de Martín Fierro&quot;, at the time Fierro is returning to the &quot;Christian&quot; world, he talks of his notoriety, apparently, in an echo of a plot point in the second book of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, as a result of the fame of &quot;El Gaucho Martín Fierro&quot;.

The style of the poem shifts several times along the way. Nominally, Martín Fierro is a first-person narrator, but the distance between his voice and that of Hernández varies at different points in the poem. The poem moves from a sentimental and romantic evocation of rural life to a brutal work of protest against military conscription and garrison life at the border forts; then it becomes an extended outlaw ballad of the life of a violent knife-fighting &quot;gaucho matrero&quot;; then it becomes a story of captivity among the Indians, followed finally by bringing its protagonist face-to-face with a series of human echoes of his past. This last set of encounters is so improbable that some commentators suggest that the episode with the black &quot;payador&quot; is actually a figment of Fierro&#x27;s imagination.

==Critical and popular reception==

&quot;Martín Fierro&quot; was an immediate popular success; it was also generally well received by the critics, although it required more than a generation for the work to be accorded the status of a classic.

Borges, who describes the work as more of a &quot;verse novel&quot; than an &quot;epic&quot;, points out that this is partly because it is such an accurate evocation of its own time that it took some distance before its greatness could become apparent.

The popular success of the work is unquestionable: at the time of the publication of the second part of the poem, the first part already had 48,000 copies in print in Argentina and Uruguay, almost unimaginable for that time. It was sold not only in bookstores but in &quot;pulperías&quot; (rural bars), and was frequently read aloud as a public entertainment.

The poem received its canonization during a series of lectures by Leopoldo Lugones in 1913 (published as &quot;El payador&quot; in 1916), where the eminent Argentine poet crowned the &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; the epic of Argentina, comparable to Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; for Italy or Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot; for Spain. Ricardo Rojas went way beyond Lugones, claiming the poem to deal, at least metaphorically, with almost every issue of Argentine history, even though, as Borges remarks, most of these aspects are notable in the poem mostly for their absence.
Previously in 1894, the Spanish poet and critic Miguel de Unamuno tried, indirectly, to claim the work for Spain, calling it the &quot;most Spanish&quot; of Latin American literature. Eleuterio Tiscornia brought to the work a critical approach akin to European philology which seems, on the surface, incommensurate with the work in question (see Borges and Ezequiel Martínez Estrada&#x27;s short-sighted attack on Tiscornia). However today, the scholarly approach of Tiscornia and others, such as Francisco Castro and Santiago Lugones, have helped make the poem accessible to those far from the Argentine context.

Among more contemporary critics, Calixto Oyuela tried to bring the focus back from the national to the individual, a critique similar to Martínez Estrada&#x27;s; he emphasized that this is the story of a particular man, a gaucho in the last days of the open range; he sees the book as a meditation on origins, a protest and a lament for a disappearing way of life. In &quot;Folletos Lenguaraces&quot;, Vicente Rossi goes beyond Oyuela to pick up where Borges left off, by seeing Fierro as an &quot;orillero&quot;, basically a hoodlum.

Borges, in his book-length collection of essays &quot;El &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;&quot;, professes himself a great admirer of the work. &quot;Argentine literature&quot;, he writes, &quot;[...] includes at least one great book, &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;&quot;—but emphasizes that its aesthetic merits should not be seen as corresponding to the merits of its protagonist. In particular, he characterizes as &quot;unfortunate&quot; that the Argentines read the story of Fierro forcing a duel of honor upon a man and ultimately killing him &quot;with indulgence or admiration, rather than with horror&quot;.

Chilean writer Roberto Bolaño wrote in his essay &quot;Derivas de la pesada&quot;: &quot;poetically Martín Fierro is not a marvel. But as a novel it is alive, full of significances to explore&quot;. He also stated that it was a &quot;novel about liberty and filth, not about education and good manners&quot; and that &quot;it is a story about valour, not a story about intelligence and much less about morals.&quot;

==In popular culture==

In the 1920s, Borges and other &quot;avant-garde&quot; Argentine writers embracing &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; published a magazine called &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;; they are often referred to collectively as the &quot;grupo Martín Fierro&quot; (&quot;Martín Fierro group&quot;), although at the time they were better known as the Florida group.

In 1952 director Jacques Tourneur made &quot;Way of a Gaucho&quot; in Argentina for 20th Century Fox. The story about an orphan gaucho called Martín Peñalosa, who has deserted from the army and becomes the leader of a rebel group, follows the legend of Martín Fierro in many ways, although the film is based upon a book by Herbert Childs and a screenplay by Philip Dunne. In 2009 the film classic was finally released first time on DVD, but at the moment only in Spain, where the title of the film is &quot;Martín, el Gaucho&quot;.

Martín Fierro Awards are the most prominent awards for Argentine radio and television. It is granted by APTRA, the Association of Argentine Television and Radio Journalists.

Leopoldo Torre Nilsson&#x27;s classic Argentine film &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; (1968) is based on the poem. Fernando Solanas&#x27; 1972 &quot;Los Hijos de Fierro&quot; () is another Argentine classic film.

In 1972, &quot;Billiken&quot; magazine published comic books written by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and drawn by Carlos Roume.

In Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, a group of Argentine anarchists led by Francisco Squalidozzi collaborate with a German filmmaker, Gerhardt von Göll, to create a film version of &quot;Martín Fierro&quot;.

Songs named after the poem have been released by the Argentine singer/songwriter Juana Molina on her album &quot;Segundo&quot; and by the German band the Magic I.D. on their album &quot;till my breath gives out&quot;.

In 2017, Gabriela Cabezón Cámara published the novel &quot;Las aventuras de la China Iron&quot;, which reclaims the story of China Iron, Martín Fierro&#x27;s abandoned wife, who is unnamed in the original epic poem.

<text>Pyskowice () is a city in Silesia in southern Poland, near Katowice. Outer city of the Metropolis GZM – metropolis with the population of 2 million. Located in the Silesian Highlands.

It is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously it was in Katowice Voivodeship. Pyskowice is one of the towns of the 2.7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the town is 18,432 (2019). It borders Gliwice, one of the largest cities of the metropolitan area, in the south.

==History==

The name of the town comes from the Old Polish male name Pysk. The oldest known mention of Pyskowice comes from a document of Bishop of Wrocław Tomasz from 1256. It was granted town rights in 1260 by Duke Władysław Opolski. The town was part of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. It remained part of various Polish-ruled duchies, including Bytom, Cieszyn, Oświęcim and Opole, until 1532 when it was incorporated to the Bohemian (Czech) Crown. In 1645, along with the Duchy of Opole, it came back under Polish rule under the House of Vasa.

It was annexed by Prussia in the 18th century, and from 1871 it was also part of Germany until 1945. In 1842, the town had a population of 3,322, mostly Polish by nationality, and Catholic by confession. Despite Prussian rule, church services were still held mainly in Polish at the time, with German services held only every fourth Sunday. In the 1921 Upper Silesia plebiscite, 73.6% of the residents voted to remain in Germany, while in the present-day district (then separate village) of Dzierżno 67.5% voted to rejoin Poland, which just regained independence following the First World War.

During the Second World War, the Germans established and operated the E578 and E749 forced labour subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the town, and the E110 and E709 subcamps in the present-day district of Dzierżno. Canadian and British prisoners of war had to work there for their German captors. The Germans also operated an additional forced labour camp for Jewish men in 1942–1944. In January 1945, as the Soviet armies resumed their offensive, the prisoners based in Pyskowice were marched westward in the so-called Long March or Death March. Some died from the bitter cold and exhaustion. Eventually the survivors were liberated by American troops in April or May 1945. After the war, the town became again part of Poland under its restored historic name.

In 1984, town limits were expanded by including Mikuszowina as a new district.

==Transport==
Polish National roads 40 and 94, and the Voivodeship road 901 run through the town, and the A1 and A4 motorways run nearby, within the metropolitan area.

There is a railway station in Pyskowice.

==Culture==
There is a railway museum (&quot;Skansen Taboru Kolejowego&quot;) in Pyskowice.

==Sports==
The local football club is Czarni Pyskowice. It competes in the lower leagues.

<text>Trzebinia (; &quot;Tchebin&quot;) is a town in Chrzanów County, Lesser Poland, Poland with an Orlen oil refinery and a major rail junction of the Kraków - Katowice line, with connections to Oświęcim and Spytkowice. The town became part of Lesser Poland Voivodeship after being part of Katowice Voivodeship (1975–1998). With population of 20,175 (Dec. 31, 2010), Trzebinia is an important industrial center. The town lies in the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, above sea level. Trzebinia is a rail and road hub, and lies at a junction of the A4 Motorway and National Road Nr. 79. The distance to John Paul II International Airport Kraków-Balice is .

==History==

History of Trzebinia dates back to the late Middle Ages. In 1325, the settlement already had a church, which was mentioned in 1470 by Jan Długosz. Until the early 15th century, Trzebinia was a royal village, then it passed into the hands of local noble families. At that time, zinc and lead deposits were discovered here. Trzebinia, however, still remained a village, or rather a mining settlement, which from 1569 until 1802 belonged to the Schilhra Trzebiński family, Abdank coat of arms. Administratively Trzebinia was located in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. In 1772, in the First Partition of Poland, it was annexed by the Austria and made part of Galicia. It was regained by Poles in the Austro-Polish War of 1809 and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. After the duchy&#x27;s dissolution, the town was part of the Free City of Kraków from 1815 to 1846, and then it was reannexed by the Austrian Empire. In the 19th century the area of Trzebinia went through the period of industrialization. In 1804-1843, five coal mines, two zinc mills and a glass factory were opened here. On September 6, 1817, the village received its town charter, and in the second half of the 19th century, further coal mines were opened here, as well as a calamine mine. In the early 20th century, Trzebinia had oil refinery, power plant, and cement mill. In 1903, the Salvatorians settled here, who in 1908 began construction of a church.

===World War II===
On September 1, 1939, the first day of the German invasion of Poland and World War II, Trzebinia was bombed by the Luftwaffe. On September 5, 1939, invading Wehrmacht soldiers mass murdered 97 people in the town. The town was then occupied by Germany, and on October 9, 1939, it was directly annexed into Nazi Germany; the border with the General Government was a few kilometers east, near Dulowa.
During the war, two forced labor subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp were located within the present-day town limits of Trzebinia: the E738 subcamp in Trzebinia and the E565 subcamp in Siersza Wodna (then a separate village, now incorporated into Trzebinia). In the E565 subcamp, British and other Commonwealth prisoners of war were imprisoned and forced to work in a coal mine, and their living accommodation was in wooden huts by the river. More Stalag VIII-B/344 POWs were transferred in January 1944 from Otmuchów in Lower Silesia to the E738 subcamp at the Trzebinia oil refinery. All 45 members of the detachment were from Commonwealth countries. A document at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum confirming arrival of POW Work Detachment E738 at Trzebinia is dated 25 February 1944. In 1944, the Germans sent kidnapped Polish children from Trzebinia to the Potulice concentration camp.

In August 1944, the E738 subcamp of Stalag VIII-B/344 was replaced by a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp. The Germans sent the British POWs back to Stalag VIII-B/344, and replaced them with hundreds of new prisoners, mostly from German-occupied Poland and Hungary. It was one of the largest subcamps of the Auschwitz III-Monowitz concentration camp and provided forced labor for a nearby oil refinery. In August 1944, the refinery at Trzebinia was bombed by the United States Air Force. Due to the high death rate among the prisoners, the SS established a crematorium in the subcamp. In January 1945, as the Red Army resumed its offensive and advanced from the east, the prisoners were marched to Rybnik in the so-called Death March. Many of them died from the bitter cold and exhaustion. From Rybnik the Germans deported them to the Sachsenhausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps. On January 23, 1945, the Germans retreated.

===Recent history===
Until 1975, the town remained in Kraków Voivodeship. In 1961, the settlement of Wodna was incorporated into Trzebinia, and in 1969, after joining with the settlement of Siersza, the town was named Trzebinia-Siersza. In 1977, the name was changed to Trzebinia. The name Siersza Wodna survives as the name of a freight railway station.

<text>Czechowice-Dziedzice (), known until 1958 as Czechowice, is a town in Bielsko County, Silesian Voivodeship, southern Poland. The town has 35,684 inhabitants, as of December 2021. It lies on the northeastern edge of the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. It is a large rail junction with four stations, located at the intersection of two major lines – east-west (Trzebinia – Zebrzydowice), and north–south (Katowice – Bielsko-Biala).

==History==

The area inhabited by the Golensizi tribe probably became part of Poland under Mieszko I of Poland, but the first certain historical mentions pertaining to the region appeared much later. The village of Czechowice was first mentioned in a Latin document of the Diocese of Wrocław called &quot;Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis&quot; from around 1305 as two settlements:
&quot;Chotowitz theutonico&quot; (&quot;German Czechowice&quot;) was presumably established under German rights (&quot;iure theuthonico&quot;) on the ground of the older &quot;Chotowitz polonico&quot;, which was continuously ruling itself under Polish traditional rights (&quot;iure polonico&quot;). The declared size of a tithe paid by villagers was also suggesting that it was an old and quite developed community. It belonged then to the Duchy of Cieszyn, formed in 1290 within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. In 1327 the duchy passed under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Bohemia as a fee, although it remained ruled by the Polish Piast dynasty until 1653, when it passed to the House of Habsburg. In 1430 the village was first mentioned under the current name of &quot;Czechowice&quot; rather than &quot;Chatowice&quot;. Dziedzice were first mentioned in 1465. The other medieval village that was later absorbed by Czechowice was Żebracz, first mentioned in 1443.

The village of Czechowice became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter&#x27;s Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as &quot;Czechowicz&quot;. In the time of Protestant Reformation, the parish of Czechowice stayed Roman Catholic, conversely to the nearby town of Bielsko and the rest of the Duchy of Cieszyn.

===19th and 20th centuries===
After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The villages as two separate municipalities were subscribed to the political and legal district of Bielsko. In 1855, a local line of the important Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway was opened to traffic with a station in Dziedzice. This led to a rapid industrialization of Dziedzice and Czechowice, especially in the late 19th century. At that time, Czechowice and Dziedzice became strong centers of the Polish national movement in stark contrast to German-dominated town of Bielsko, whose inhabitants used to call the area of Czechowice and Dziedzice &quot;verfluchte polnische Winkel&quot; (&quot;cursed Polish corner&quot;). Polish school, pedagogical, sports and other organizations were established here.
After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, the reestablishment of independent Poland, the Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, Czechowice and Dziedzice became a part of Poland. In the interwar period, the industry continued to expand. New factories were founded, which produced machines, bicycles, matches, paper, cables etc. New culture centers, amateur theaters, cinemas, choirs and sports clubs were founded. In 1924, the Freedom Monument (&quot;Pomnik Wolności&quot;) was unveiled, financed by voluntary contributions. Patriotic celebrations take place at the monument.

Czechowice and Dziedzice were annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II in September 1939. The local population was subjected to deportations for forced labor into Germany and to concentration camps, expropriations, street round-ups, death sentences and public executions (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). Polish social and political life, as well as Polish education were being destroyed. In 1942, the Germans established two forced labor camps in the town: one for Poles (&quot;Polenlager&quot;) and one for Jewish men. During the Oil Campaign of World War II, the oil refinery at Czechowice was bombed on August 20, 1944. In 1944, the occupiers established the Tschechowitz I &amp; II subcamps of Auschwitz in Czechowice-Dziedzice, which provided forced labor for the SOCONY-Vacuum oil plant and housed over 600 prisoners. In 1945, German occupation ended and Czechowice and Dziedzice were restored to Poland.

In 1951, Dziedzice were merged with Czechowice, concurrently the expanded gmina was given town rights. However, the name of the new town was &quot;Czechowice&quot;, which disappointed the citizens of Dziedzice. After complaints in 1958, the town was renamed &quot;Czechowice-Dziedzice&quot;.

From 1975 to 1998, it was attached to the Katowice Voivodeship, and since 1999 to Silesian Voivodeship.

In 1993, a new Freedom Monument was erected in place of the former, destroyed by the Germans in 1939.

<text>Pszczyna (, ) is a town in Silesian Voivodeship, population 25,823 (2019), and is the seat of a local gmina (commune) and district.

Pszczyna is situated in Silesia Province and was previously part of Katowice Province from 1975 until 1998 administrative reforms.

==Etymology==
There are several different theories of the origins of the name &quot;Pszczyna&quot;. Ezechiel Zivier (1868–1925) hypothesized that the land was first owned by Pleszko (alternatively Leszko, or possibly Leszek, Duke of Racibórz). Polish scholar Aleksander Brückner in turn explained the name based on its old spelling &quot;Plszczyna&quot;, from the ancient Polish word &quot;pło&quot; or &quot;pleso&quot; meaning a lake, making &quot;Plszczyna&quot; a place by a lake. Brückner&#x27;s derivation, suggesting a marshy lakeside, based on Proto-Slavic &quot;plszczyna&quot;, is generally accepted in literature. Yet another explanation has been put forward by Prof. Jan Miodek of Wrocław University, who derives the town&#x27;s name from the name of a nearby river, now known as Pszczynka. Miodek claims, firstly, that the town owes its name to the river, not vice versa (as the -ka suffix in the present name of the river would indicate), and secondly, that the original name of the river, &quot;Blszczyna&quot;, derives from Proto-Slavic &quot;blskati&quot;, to glisten. The oldest recorded versions of the town&#x27;s name (Plisschyn, Plisczyna, Plyssczyna, Blissczyna, Blyssczyna, Plesna, Pssczyna) exclude none of the above derivations, except perhaps the Leszko/Leszek one, which seems far fetched. Neither does the German name &quot;Pleß&quot; shed any light, as it simply reflects the Polish name at the time of the beginning of German settlement.

==History==

===Middle Ages and early Modern period===
The oldest settlement evolved around a small gord and wooden church in what was later known as Stara Wieś. The modern town (around &quot;Market Square&quot;) was probably founded in the second half of the 13th century. The first reference in sources to the place dates from 1303. The main trading route between Kievan Rus and the Moravian Gate ran through Pszczyna in the early Middle Ages, and the small settlement probably provided protective measures for merchants on the ford (surrounded by marshlands) of the small Pszczynka river.

The land around Pszczyna was historically part of Lesser Poland. Casimir II the Just ceded the land to Mieszko Plątonogi, another Piast duke, of the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz, about 1177. Mieszko Plątonogi was succeeded by other dukes from the Opole-Racibórz line: Casimir I of Opole, Mieszko II the Fat, his brother Władysław Opolski, his two sons - Casimir of Bytom and Bolko I of Opole, and finally Leszek of Racibórz, who was the last to preserve the Duchy&#x27;s independence. In 1327, he was forced to acknowledge sovereignty of John, King of Bohemia. After Leszek died childless in 1336, his lands passed down to his brother-in-law, Nicholas II, Duke of Opava (Mikołaj II), of the Czech Premyslid royal dynasty.

Mikołaj II, his son John I, Duke of Opava-Ratibor, and his grandson John II, Duke of Opava-Ratibor (Jan II Żelazny) ruled the land for seven decades. In 1407, John II separated the area that is modern-day Pleß from his duchy as a wittum for his new wife, Helena of Lithuania (Helena Korybutówna, niece of Władysław II Jagiełło, the king of Poland). The boundaries outlined by John II survived well into the 20th century. The contemporary land (powiat) of Pleß is only about half the size it was during the Middle Ages.
In 1433, Pleß was attacked by the Hussites, who laid siege to the castle but were eventually repulsed. Helena of Lithuania outlived John II, and reigned until 1449. The land was inherited by her son, Nicholas V, Duke of Krnov and then his widow, Barbara Rockenberg, daughter of a wealthy Kraków merchant. She was expelled by her stepson, John IV, who assumed power in the years 1462–1465. His rights were in turn disputed by his brother, Wenceslaus III, Duke of Rybnik. Aggressive policies caused a conflict between Wenceslaus III and the King of Hungary and Bohemia, Matthias Corvinus. Matthias overran the land and held the duke in captivity until his death. Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn, the last of the local Piast dynasty bloodline, received the land in 1480 as a dowry of his wife, Joanna. Casimir II sold it to a Hungarian noble Elek Thurzó () in 1517. Two years later, Louis II, King of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia instituted the &quot;Free State of Pszczyna&quot;, with its ruler responsible not to him but directly to the Holy Roman Emperor. The new state was expanded to include fifty villages and four towns (including Bieruń, Mysłowice, and Mikołów), and was sworn allegiance by another 27 vassal villages.

The Thurzo family were in close relations with Polish King Sigismund I the Old. Queen Bona Sforza stayed for a night on her way to her wedding to Sigismund in Kraków in (1518). Thurzo possessions were diminished over time (stripped of Mysłowice in 1536) and eventually the land of Pleß was purchased by Balthasar von Promnitz, bishop of Wrocław, under a special provision that the land should be further divided.

===Late Modern period===
Pleß was ravaged and pillaged during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. During the War of the Austrian Succession, the Kingdom of Prussia clashed with Austria for Silesia and Frederick The Great, the king of Prussia, seized most of Silesia in the First Silesian War of 1741–1742. The town was pillaged again during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Shortly afterwards, the last Promnitz gave the land to his nephew, Frederic Erdmann.

Erdmann&#x27;s line, the Anhalts, held Pleß until the middle of the 19th century, when it passed to Hans Heinrich X of the powerful Hochberg family who held extensive lands around present-day Wałbrzych. The Hochbergs reached great prominence and wealth in the 19th century.

From 1816 to 1922, the town was the seat of .

During the Polish January Uprising in 1863 Poles smuggled large amounts of gunpowder through the town to the Russian Partition of Poland. From 1871 Pleß was part of Germany, however, at the beginning of the 20th century, over 80 percent of the district&#x27;s population spoke Polish; during the 1910 census 86 percent declared as Polish speakers, though in the town itself the percentage of Polish speakers was 33. When World War I erupted, the Hochbergs lent the estate to the German state for military purposes. The German chief of staff held his headquarters at the castle of Pleß, often visited by Emperor Wilhelm II himself.
After the war ended, the newly established Second Polish Republic and the German Weimar Republic struggled for control of the region. Prince Hans Heinrich XV favored the creation of an independent Silesian Republic or at least an independent Upper Silesia. The latter was supported by the Union of Upper Silesians (1919–1924), which he financed. With the outbreak of the Silesian Uprising, the Hochbergs sided firmly with the German cause and made the estate available to German paramilitary organizations, including for a prison for the Polish insurgents. Hans Heinrich XV supplied units at his own expense, commanded by his son, Hans Heinrich XVII; they took part in the bitter struggles for Góra Świętej Anny in 1921. Earlier that year a plebiscite was held to determine the future of the region. In &quot;Kreis Pleß&quot; 53 thousands voted for Poland and 18 thousands for Germany. By contrast, voting in the town of Pleß gave victory to Germany, with 2843 over 910. In view of the plebiscite results and in consequence of the Third Silesian Uprising the Versailles Treaty gave the land of Pleß to the Second Polish Republic. On May 29, 1922, the Polish army officially entered the city and the Polish administration took over, with Jan Figna becoming the first Polish mayor.

===World War II===
During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, fighting occurred in the surroundings of Pszczyna, which can be seen by observing the leftovers of concrete strongholds around the town. In that area, the Battle of Pszczyna took place on September 1–2, 1939, where German forces breached main Polish defensive lines protecting the Silesian area. On September 4, in the local park, the German &quot;Freikorps&quot; murdered 14 Poles who had taken part in the defense of nearby Katowice (13 boy scouts and one school teacher). They were buried in the nearby forest in an unmarked mass grave. Poles arrested during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, aimed at the extermination of the Polish intelligentsia, were imprisoned in a local court prison, and then deported to concentration camps.

From November 1942 to April 1943, the Germans operated a forced labour subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp in the present-day district of Stara Wieś.

In the final stages of the war, in January 1945, the Nazi Germans murdered many prisoners of the Auschwitz concentration camp, who tried to escape during a death march. Between the end of January and beginning of February 1945, the war storm came through Pszczyna with no serious damage to the city. Unfortunately, the wooden historic church of Saint Jadwiga burned down in 1939. The city was liberated on February 10, 1945.

===After 1945===

Unlike the rest of Upper Silesia, Pszczyna never experienced rapid industrialization. The ELWO factory was expanded and a new creamery and mill were founded. This, however, helped to preserve the historic old town and the palace located in the city center.

==Population==
In 2010 Pszczyna had a population of 25,415.

===Jews in Pszczyna===
The Jewish community was small before the edict of 1780 granting Jews the right to settle in Silesian towns to the east of river Oder. By 1787, the Jewish population had grown to 85 people. Regulations passed by Frederick William III in 1812 proclaimed Jews to be full citizens of the state. As their numbers grew, Jews called for a synagogue to perform their religious duties. A wooden synagogue was built in 1834 and, eventually, a bricked structure in 1852. The synagogue has survived into the 21st century but nothing of historical value remains of the interior: during World War II it was used as a cinema.

The community&#x27;s educational needs were also met with the establishment of a &quot;cheder&quot; (Jewish school) in 1812. From 1820, Jews were allowed to attend Protestant and Catholic schools. A new, joint Protestant and Jewish school was established in 1873 and became a municipal school in 1893.

The Jewish community reached its highest peak in 1885, numbering 341 members. Markus Brann, Jewish theologian and historian and future lecturer at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau, was active in Pszczyna during that period. The number of Jews had dropped significantly when Poland took control of the city in 1922, as most of the Jews identifying themselves as Germans had left for Germany.

Only scarce evidence of the town&#x27;s former Jewish presence has been left – the cemetery, the former residence of the Jewish community and the synagogue.
The cemetery in Pszczyna, on Katowicka Street, was founded in 1814. The last reported burial took place in 1937. During World War II the cemetery was not destroyed. The oldest tombstone was discovered in June 2009. It belongs to Gitel Gutmann, who died on September 10, 1814. The cemetery is in the permanent custody of Sławomir Pastuszka, who provides information both on the cemetery and on the local Jewish community. On May 8, 2012, it was reported that the Jewish cemetery had been vandalized. Nineteen tombstones, some of which date back to the early 19th century, were damaged in the old part of the cemetery. The local community contributed to the restoration of 150 graves of historical value.

===Protestants in Pszczyna===
Lutheranism was introduced to Pszczyna in 1568 by Duke Karol Promnitz. In a course of next 20 years, Lutheranism spread among the local population. A Protestant minister came to the county in 1569, followed by opening of the first Protestant school. During the counter-reformation in 1649 celebrations of Protestant religious service were confined to the Castle of Pszczyna.

From 1709 on Erdmann Promnitz received permission for building a Protestant church. Along with church, a Protestant school had been reintroduced. The church burned down in 1905 and was rebuilt two years later. It is still in operation and serves as the central point for the Protestant community, which numbers 1500 members.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Pszczyna is situated on sandy plains ascending into the east. The land is slightly hilly, but with no large relative elevations. The highest points are less than above sea level.

===Climate===
As Pszczyna is in a moderate climatic zone, the climate is directly influenced by a clash of oceanic and continental air masses. While the former usually takes the upper hand, the temperature does not vary widely. Severe or long winters are rare. The warm tropical air coming through the Moravian Gate (a depression between the Sudetes and the Carpathian Mountains) contributes to this.

The average annual temperature is . The hottest month is July ( average) and the coldest is January ( average).

R. Gumiński researched the climate in the land around Pszczyna. He defined three distinguished sub-climatic provinces – the western &quot;podsudecka&quot;, the eastern &quot;tarnowska&quot;, and the northern &quot;kielecko-czestochowska&quot;. The eastern part offers the most favorable environment for plants and vegetation, with over 220 days of growing season and of precipitation. Pszczyna gets the least rainfall in winter months and the highest level in July. Snowfall begins in the middle of November, lingers for 50–70 days, and generally does not exceed a depth of .

Slight westerly winds are dominant, averaging . The period of windless weather appears regularly, caused by the cover of, and the dry down-slope foehn winds arriving from, the Beskid Śląski mountain range.

Goczałkowice Reservoir, by far the largest reservoir in southern Poland, gives the climate in Pszczyna an even more distinctive imprint by moderating winters and summers.

===Land use===

The total area of includes of farmland ( of arable land, of orchards, of meadows, of pasture) and of forest grounds ( of forests, of tree-planted and shrub-planted land).

==Sports==
The local football club is MKS Iskra Pszczyna. It competes in the lower leagues.

<text>Czerwionka-Leszczyny () is a town in Silesian Voivodeship in southern Poland. It is the only town in Rybnik county (which is separate from Rybnik city) and the seat of the larger Czerwionka-Leszczyny municipality which also includes 6 villages. Czerwionka-Leszczyny was created by a merger of two towns (Czerwionka and Leszczyny) and two villages (Czuchów and Dębieńsko), which to this day maintain their separate identities. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 27,683.

A former mining town, it has transformed into a commuter town for the nearby cities of Rybnik, Gliwice and Katowice.

==History==

=== Pre-industrial age ===
People have settled in the area of Czerwionka-Leszczyny as early as 8th century BC, as evidenced by a Bronze Age bracelet that was found in Czerwionka and is currently stored in a museum in Gliwice. The first written sources mentioning Leszczyny, &quot;Liber Fundationis Episcopus Wratislaviensis&quot; (book proclaiming the foundation of the Wrocław diocese), dates back to 1305. In 1420, a parish was founded in Dębieńsko, and in 1447 Leszczyny parish is mentioned for the first time. In the middle ages, the area of modern Czerwionka-Leszczyny belonged to the Kingdom of Poland, next Polish Duchy of Racibórz as a result of the division of Poland into districts in the Middle Ages, and since 1327 was under Czech patronage and became a part of the Holy Roman Empire. Since 1526, the area of Czerwionka-Leszczyny belonged to the Habsburg Monarchy. Following the Silesian Wars, Prussia conquered these territories in 1742. In 1818, a new administrative division placed the area of modern Czerwionka-Leszczyny in Rybnik county.

=== Industrial age ===

==== Early industrial age ====
The exploration of natural resources in Czerwionka-Leszczyny area started in the 17th century. In 1788 the first test shaft were created to confirm hard coal reserves, and in 1792 the owner of Czerwionka and Dębieńsko, baron von Wilczek, secured a permit for the first mine, &quot;Neues Glück&quot; (&quot;New luck&quot;). In 1806, coal mine &quot;Ciossek&quot; and in 1807 coal mine &quot;Marianne&quot; were opened by count Węgierski. In 1813 &quot;Neues Glück&quot; was merged with nearby &quot;Anton&quot; shaft to create &quot;Antons Glück&quot; (&quot;Anthony&#x27;s luck&quot;) coal mine, which since 1823 produced 14,000 tonnes of coal annually. By 1850, around 25 other small shafts and mines were opened in the area. These establishments were selling coals locally, to nearby small-scale zinc smelters and ironworks.

==== Dębieńsko Coal Mine ====
In 1856, Czerwionka and Leszczyny gained railway connection to Rybnik and Katowice, which opened the area to cheaper iron, zinc and steel, undercutting the local industry. However, rapidly growing demand for coal in the Upper Silesian Industrial Region led to establishment of the &quot;Dubensko&quot; (later &quot;Dębieńsko&quot;) coal mine. In 1896, &quot;Vereinigte Königs- und Laurahütte&quot; corporation (owner of steelworks in Chorzów) bought rights to coal fields in Czerwionka area and opened the mine in on November 2, 1898. Three shafts were built and later deepened in 1899-1900, which allowed the mine to increase coal production from 4,010 tonnes in 1899 to 492,478 tonnes in 1912. In 1910, a dam with electricity generators has been built on the nearby Bierawka river to create a reservoir for the mine&#x27;s use, and in 1913 a cocking facility has been built next to the mine.

The &quot;Dębieńsko&quot; Coal Mine has been a catalyst for a rapid population growth in Czerwionka and nearby villages. The coal mine built two housing estates for miners. First, the so-called &quot;Staro Kolonia&quot; (&quot;Old Colony&quot;) close to the mine, with director&#x27;s villa, 14 8-family houses and a police station has been constructed along with the mine. Later, as the demand for workers could not be met by local population, a newer and larger housing estate called &quot;Familoki,&quot; with 96 houses of different sizes and shapes, have been constructed between 1902-1916. That later estate is now a tourist attraction and is under conservatorship.

=== 20th century ===

==== After World War I ====
Following World War I, the area of modern Czerwionka-Leszczyny, along with all of Upper Silesia, found itself between Germany and newly-formed Poland. Under The Treaty of Versailles agreement, Upper Silesia was supposed to vote in a plebiscite whether it wants to stay in Germany or join Poland. The voting took place on March 20, 1921, and in the Czerwionka-Leszczyny area, the majority voted for Poland. The results per locality are shown in the table below

Following the plebiscite and a disadvantageous division of Upper Silesia from the Polish point of view, local Poles started the Third Silesian Uprising, after which the Entente powers granted Poland more territory than previously planned, including all of modern Czerwionka-Leszczyny. The area belonged to the autonomous Silesian Voivodeship in the interwar period. In 1930s, the Great Depression took a heavy toll on the local mining industry, with as much as 25% if miners being on forced unpaid leave. The harsh economic conditions caused many people to involve in bootleg mining.

==== World War II ====
Following the German invasion of Poland, Czerwionka-Leszczyny was annexed into the Third Reich. While some locals, particularly members of the local intelligentsia such as teachers, clerks and clergy were rounded up and shoot or sent to concentration camps for their pro-Polish stance during the interwar period, most of the population enjoyed relative peace compared to other parts of Poland. In 1940, after expulsion of ethnic Poles to the General Government, the nazis introduced the Deutsche Volksliste, a classification of desirability of the population in occupied western Poland. It divided people into four classes (1. &quot;Volksdeutcher&quot; - ethnic German, active in German minority before the war; 2. &quot;Deutschstämmige&quot; - ethnic German not active in German minority; 3. &quot;Eingedeutschte&quot; - native populations, considered by the nazis to be partially polonized Germans; 4. &quot;Rückgedeutschte&quot; - fully polonized Germans or Poles who were deemed racially worthy or collaborated with the Reich). In Czerwionka-Leszczyny area, as in most of Upper Silesia, the vast majority were classified as category 3 and given conditional, 10-year German citizenship.

At the end of World War II, in late January 1945, one of the Death Marches from Auschwitz led through Leszczyny, where hundreds of prisoners were killed by the SS men: 447 near the train station and 288 in a field nearby.

==== After World War II ====
Czerwionka-Leszczyny area has been liberated by the Red Army on January 27, 1945. In the months immediately after the liberation, the Soviet military command and new Polish communist leadership deported many men to Donetsk Coal Area, Kazakhstan and Siberia to work as slave labor for the USSR, while others were incarcerated and often killed in camps such as Zgoda because the new government considered Silesians to be German.

In September 1945 the new communist government made coal the most strategic natural resource to the country, which heavily influenced development of the Upper Silesian region, including Czerwionka-Leszczyny, in the subsequent decades through massive investment into coal mining industry and scaling up productions and employment. In the early 1950s the construction of a large mining estate started in Leszczyny, pulling people from all across Poland to work in coal industry, and in the 1960s similar estates started to pop up in Czerwionka. This new influx of Poles caused an ethnic conflict with native Silesians in the 1960s and 70s, as natives saw new migrants as causing crime and public disorder, while the migrants considered migrants to be German and therefore not welcomed in Poland. In the 1970s and 1980s, many native Silesians emigrated to Germany through the family reunification scheme organized by both countries.

Growing population was reflected by changes in administrative status: in 1962 Czerwionka, Leszczyny and Czuchów were merged into a town under the name Czerwionka-Leszczyny. In 1975, the name of the town was changed to only Leszczyny for political reasons (Leszczyny was majority-Polish, while Czerwionka was majority-Silesian and had a history of voting for Germany in the plebiscite), and in 1977 Dębieńsko was annexed by the town, creating the modern-day Czerwionka-Leszczyny. Following the collapse of communism, in 1992 the name was changed back to Czerwionka-Leszczyny.

=== 1990s and 21st century ===
After the collapse of communism and return to the market economy, coal mining suffered from insufficient demand and rising costs against a government-regulated coal price, causing losses. Various restructuring programs in the 1990s alleviated the issue only partially, and by the end of 1990s it was clear the industry needs downsizing. The government of Jerzy Buzek adopted a plan which aimed at reducing employment in the industry through buy-outs and ultimately closing mines. In 1999, a list of mines to be closed was published, including &quot;Dębieńsko&quot;, and production ended on October 25, 2000. At the time of the closure, 2,400 people were employed at the mine, or which 1,300 were granted various forms of social welfare such as early retirement or buy-outs.

Since then, the town has re-oriented itself as a commuter town for nearby larger cities of Rybnik, Gliwice, Katowice and Żory.

== Geography ==
is a town in Silesia in southern Poland, on the Bierawka River (tributary of the Oder), located on Silesian Highlands, about 50 km (31 mi) north of the Silesian Beskids. It is an outer suburb of Metropolis GZM, with a population of over 3 million, and a suburb of Rybnik, both making Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area with a population of 4,676,983 people.

==Demographics==

Czerwionka-Leszczyny&#x27;s population peaked in 1998 with 30,343 inhabitants and since then has been declining slowly. However, the population of the broader municipality has been on a steady rise, offsetting population loss within town limits. As of 2020, 27,888 people lived in the town, of which 4,648 (16.7%) were 14 or younger, 18,814 (67.5%) were 15-64, and 4,426 (15.8%) were 65 or older. This makes Czerwionka-Leszczyny relatively young compared to Poland as a whole, as countrywide only 15.4% of the population is 14 or younger while 18.6% is 65 or older.

In 2019, 308 babies were born in Czerwionka-Leszczyny while 336 people died, a natural loss of 28 people. This represents a shift in natural change patterns as in prior years, Czerwionka-Leszczyny noted natural increases: +6 in 2018, +70 in 2017, +41 in 2016. In 2019, 203 people moved to Czerwionka-Leszczyny from elsewhere in Poland and 4 moved from abroad, while 377 people moved away from Czerwionka-Leszczyny to elsewhere in Poland and 5 moved abroad. In total, the town lost 175 people to migration - a sharp increase from a loss of 56 in 2018, 64 in 2017 and 31 in 2016.

In 2019, neighborhood populations were as follows: 
==Economy==
Since 1898, the town&#x27;s main employer was the &quot;Dębieńsko&quot; coal mine, which was closed up in 2000, causing substantial job loss and unemployment. Employment in Czerwionka-Leszczyny municipality (the town and the surrounding villages) decreases from 8,434 in 1995 to 5,082 in 2000, achieving a low of just 3,784 in 2003. In Czerwionka-Leszczyny proper, it was 7,592, 3,971 and 3,111, respectively. Since then, the municipality succeeded in attracting outside investment and employment increased to 5,037 in 2019. As most of new investments are green fields, most of that growth happened in the rural part of the municipality, and the town itself had only 3,257 jobs as of 2019. Commuting has also helped ease the pressure on the job market. In 2006, 3,655 people from the town commuted to other localities for work (while 681 commuted to work in Czerwionka-Leszczyny). In 2016, these numbers have increased to 4,664 and 1,048, respectively.

Both new investments and increase in commuting resulted in dramatic decline in unemployment. In 2003 (earliest available data), there were 2,384 registered unemployed people in the municipality of Czerwionka-Leszczyny. In 2019, only 546 remained in that status.

<text>Rydułtowy () is a town in southern Poland, in the Wodzisław County of the Silesian Voivodeship. Rydułtowy is in the south-western part of the Silesian Highland, on the Rybnik Plateau, in the Oświęcim-Racibórz Valley.

A mining town, Rydułtowy has been closely bound with the 200-year-old &quot;Rydułtowy-Anna&quot; coal mine.

==History==
Rydułtowy was first mentioned in a document of the Diocese of Wrocław from 1228 as &quot;Rudolphi Willa&quot;, when it was part of the Duchy of Racibórz of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland.

In 1861, Rydułtowy Dolne had an entirely Polish population of 1,066, while Rydułtowy Górne had 360 inhabitants. In the late 19th century, the main occupation of the population was farming and coal mining. In 1923, the first Polish scout troop of Rydułtowy was founded. Rydułtowy Dolne and Rydułtowy Górne were merged in 1926.
Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Rydułtowy was occupied by Germany until 1945. Many local Polish scouts were killed during the war, and some teachers from Rydułtowy were among Polish teachers murdered by the Germans in concentration camps as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). The Germans operated five forced labour camps in Rydułtowy, including a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp. The prisoners of the camps were initially Poles from nearby settlements, and then also French, English and Soviet prisoners of war. Over 1,000 mostly Jewish prisoners were held in the subcamp of Auschwitz. Prisoners unable to continue labour were sent back to Auschwitz and gassed there, while over 50 prisoners died in the subcamp itself, also by suicide. In January 1945, the Germans evacuated the prisoners on foot to Wodzisław Śląski, and then deported them to the Mauthausen concentration camp.

In 1951, Rydułtowy was granted town rights, and the neighboring settlement of Pietrzkowice was included within town limits as a new district.

<text>Łaziska Górne (, ) is a town in Silesia in southern Poland, near Katowice. Outer town of the Metropolis GZM – metropolis with the population of 2 million. Located in the Silesian Highlands.

It is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously in Katowice Voivodeship, and before then, of the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Łaziska is one of the towns of the 2,7 million conurbation - Katowice urban area and within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the town is 22,298 (2019).

==History==

Łaziska is historically subdivided into three parts: Łaziska Dolne (&quot;Lower Łaziska&quot;), Łaziska Średnie (&quot;middle Łaziska&quot;) and &quot;Łaziska Górne&quot; (&quot;upper Łaziska&quot;). All of them are now part of the town, which was named only after the last one. The oldest settlement was located in what is now Łaziska Średnie. The village &quot;Łaziska&quot; was first mentioned in 1287 as &quot;villa Lasiszka&quot;, although the document could have been a falsificate. The second in seniority was &quot;Łaziska Dolne&quot;, and the youngest &quot;Łaziska Górne&quot;.

It was part of medieval Piast-ruled Poland, and then passed under Bohemian (Czech) suzerainty. During the political upheaval caused by Matthias Corvinus the land around Pszczyna was overtaken by Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn, who sold it in 1517 to the Hungarian magnates of the Thurzó family, forming the Pless state country. In the accompanying sales document issued on 21 February 1517 the two villages were mentioned as &quot;Lazyska Dolny&quot; and &quot;Lazyska Horny&quot;. Łaziska Średnie was, in contrary to Łaziska Dolne and Łaziska Górne, a private village until 1814.

The Kingdom of Bohemia in 1526 became part of the Habsburg monarchy. In the War of the Austrian Succession most of Silesia was conquered by the Kingdom of Prussia, including the three sister settlements, and from 1871 all were part of Germany. In 1913, the Polish choir &quot;Echo&quot; was founded in Łaziska Górne, as one of the oldest in the region, and then it operated despite repressions from the German authorities, before the temporary suspension of activities during World War I. In 1918 the war ended and Poland regained independence, and after the subsequent Polish Silesian Uprisings, which were also fought in Łaziska, all three settlements were reintegrated with Poland.

Already on September 2–3, 1939, in the beginning of the German invasion of Poland and World War II, German troops committed massacres of Poles in Łaziska Górne, Łaziska Dolne and Łaziska Średnie, killing 26, 17 and 19 people, respectively (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). On September 6, 1939, the &quot;Freikorps&quot; murdered seven more Poles in Łaziska Górne. Among the victims of the massacres were former insurgents of the Silesian Uprisings, activists, miners, craftsmen, workers, a teacher, local official, farmer, and also teenagers and women. The town was then occupied by Germany until 1945. Seven Polish policemen who were either born or served in Łaziska were murdered by the Russians in Tver in April–May 1940 during the large Katyn massacre. The Germans established and operated a forced labour camp for Jews in Łaziska Górne, and the E393 forced labour subcamp of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in Łaziska Średnie.

In 1951, Łaziska Górne was granted town rights, and in 1973 Łaziska Dolne and Łaziska Średnie were included within its town limits as new districts.

==Industry==

* Bolesław Śmiały Coal Mine
* Łaziska Steel Mill

==Sports==

<text>Bieruń (, ) is a town in Upper Silesia, in southern Poland, seat of the Bieruń-Lędziny County in the Silesian Voivodeship. It is located about south of Katowice.

==Geography==
It is located in the Silesian Highlands, on the Gostynia river, a tributary of the Vistula. It is located in the southern part of the Metropolis GZM - metropolis with a population of about 2 million. 
Bieruń is one of the towns of the 2.7 million conurbation – the Katowice urban area, and within the greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the town itself is 19,334 (December 2021). Bieruń includes dzielnicas Bieruń Stary, Bieruń Nowy, Ściernie, Jajosty, Bijasowice and Czarnuchowice and is bordered with Lędziny, Tychy, Chełm Śląski, Bojszowy and Oświęcim.

==History==
The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century. Following the fragmentation of Poland, it formed part of various Piast-ruled provincial duchies of Poland, incl. Opole and Racibórz. Bieruń Stary was the location of a motte-and-bailey castle from the 13th–14th century, which is now an archaeological site. In the 14th century, it passed under Bohemian rule. The settlement of &quot;Berouna&quot; was first mentioned in a 1376 deed. The name is most probably related to the, similarly spelled, Slavic deity Perun, remains of its cultic place still present at nearby Lędziny. John II, the Přemyslid duke of Racibórz granted it town privileges in 1387. Later on, it returned to the Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty as part of the united Duchy of Opole and Racibórz. After the extinction of the Opole line of the Piasts, in 1532, Bieruń was incorporated by the Habsburg monarchy.

With most of Silesia, it was conquered by Prussia in the First Silesian War of 1740–42 and afterwards incorporated into the Silesia Province. In the mid-19th century, the town&#x27;s population was predominantly Catholic by confession. On 18 June 1845, a fire destroyed large areas of the town; King Frederick William IV of Prussia personally donated 9000 talers for its reconstruction. Cigarette and munitions factories were set up in the town in the mid-19th century. It became part of the German Empire in 1871 under the Germanized name &quot;Berun&quot;. In Polish it was known as both &quot;Bieruń&quot; and &quot;Beruń&quot;. Seven annual fairs were held in the town in the late 19th century. Located near the border with Lesser Poland and Austrian Silesia, &quot;Berun&quot; until 1919 was the most southeasterly town of Germany.

After the restoration of independent Poland in 1918, the Third Silesian Uprising of 1921 and the subsequent Upper Silesia plebiscite (in which 1,427 or 82.1% of residents in Bieruń Stary and 292 or 58.4% of residents in Bieruń Nowy voted for Poland), Bieruń was reintegrated with Poland, within which it formed part of the Silesian Voivodeship.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany until 1945. After the war it was administratively part of the Katowice Voivodeship until 1998. From 1975 until 1991 it was a district of the neighbouring Tychy municipality.

==Sports==
The local football clubs are Unia Bieruń and Piast Bieruń. Both compete in the lower leagues.

<text>Czeladź (; ) is a town in Zagłębie Dąbrowskie (part of historic Lesser Poland), in southern Poland, near Katowice and Sosnowiec. Located in the Silesian Highlands, on the Brynica river (tributary of the Vistula), it is the oldest urban center of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie. The area of Czeladź is 16 km2, and it borders Będzin, Sosnowiec, Katowice and Siemianowice Śląskie.

The town is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously it was in Katowice Voivodeship. Czeladź is one of the cities of the 2,7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the town as of December 2021 is 30,732. Founded in the 13th century, Czeladź was granted city status in 1262. In the years 1434–1790, it belonged to the Duchy of Siewierz. In the 19th century, Czeladź became an important mining center, with the &quot;Saturn&quot; coal mine opened there in the late 19th century. It also was a main center of Jewish culture, destroyed in The Holocaust.

==History==
First historic mention of Czeladź comes from 1228, in a bill of Duke Casimir I of Opole, in which the boundaries of the village were mentioned, a public house, as well as a bridge over the Brynica. In 1243, the village (spelled as &quot;Celad&quot;, and already having the status of a defensive gord) was mentioned again, this time in a document of Duke Konrad I of Masovia, as it had been destroyed in 1241, during the first Mongol invasion of Poland. It belonged to an abbey from Staniątki, and in 1260, Prince Władysław of Opole decided to purchase the village with its parish church. Two years later, Czeladź was sold to an abbey from Henryków, and was granted Magdeburg rights. The town remained within territory of Silesian duchies, but at the same time, &quot;Czeles&quot;, as it was known, was under the jurisdiction of bishops of Kraków. In 1434 it became part of the Duchy of Siewierz, a property of Kraków Bishops. The town had a defensive wall, remains of which were discovered in 2006, and a town hall, where on March 9, 1589, the agreement between Poles and Austrians was signed, ending the War of the Polish Succession. Czeladź suffered much damage inflicted by the Swedes in the Deluge (1655–60).
In 1790, the Duchy of Siewierz was incorporated directly into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and King Stanisław August Poniatowski made Czeladź a free city. After the Partitions of Poland, Czeladź since 1815 belonged to the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and was located on the border with Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s province of Silesia. During the January Uprising, in February 1863, Czeladź was briefly captured by Polish insurgents after their victory in the Battle of Sosnowiec nearby. Since the 1860s, the town began to turn into an industrial center. Two coal mines were opened – &quot;Czeladź&quot; (1870), and &quot;Saturn&quot; (1880). Workers&#x27; settlements were built, and the dynamic growth was not stopped by World War I, when Czeladź was occupied by the German Empire. In 1915, a power plant was opened, and Czeladź became a magnet for farmers from overpopulated Lesser Poland&#x27;s villages, who came here in search of work. Tenement houses replaced wooden huts, streets were paved and parks opened. Mining emerged as an engine of town&#x27;s development, and in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, Czeladź kept its industrial position. Coal resources, however, became depleted and mines, starting in the 1960s, would make their workers redundant. Since the notion of unemployment did not officially exist in a Communist country, new companies were opened for the dismissed miners – &quot;Transport Company Transbud&quot; (1969), &quot;Energy Company Energopol&quot; (1970), and &quot;Window Manufacturer Erg&quot; (1971).

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany until 1945. In September 1939, the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town and would commit various atrocities against the population. Nearly all of Czeladź&#x27; Jewish community was murdered during the occupation. Jews numbered around 1,000, about 5% of the population, at the beginning of the war. The German invasion led to the immediate abuse, robbery, and murder of Jewish residents. 22 Polish policemen and 15 Polish military officers from Czeladź were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. In June 1940, both Poles and Polish Jews were forced to go to the town square where they were beaten and tortured as retaliation for the murder of a German. Afterwards, 20 of the Jews were detained and murdered. Polish hostages from Czeladź were among 20 Poles massacred by the Germans on July 16, 1940, in Olkusz. In 1941, the Germans forced Jews into a ghetto. Periodically, some were sent to forced labor camps. In May 1942, 200 residents of the ghetto were sent to Auschwitz. Most sent to Auschwitz were immediately murdered or died later from starvation, disease, and brutality. In May, 1943, the ghetto was &quot;liquidated&quot; with the last Jews sent to Będzin and then on to Auschwitz. Only 40 Czeladź Jews are thought to have survived Auschwitz, the labor camps, or by hiding in the area. The Germans also established and operated three forced labor subcamps (E580, E587, E754) of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the town. In 1944, the Germans sent kidnapped Polish children from Czeladź to the Potulice concentration camp.

In the mid-1970s, a number of blocks of flats was built in Czeladź, to accommodate an influx of workers employed at the construction of Katowice Steelworks.

<text>Olkusz ( &quot;Elkish&quot;, ) is a town in southern Poland with 36,607 inhabitants (2014). Situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Katowice Voivodeship (1975–1998), it is the capital of Olkusz County. Olkusz is known for its abundance of silver, which is mined and extracted in the vicinity.

== Surroundings ==
The city is on the Baba River, a tributary of the Sztoła, with a major road reaching it from Warsaw and Kraków, making it the central city of the vicinity. Tourists who wish to visit nature and historical sites, start from here. Also, Olkusz is located on the main railroad line, which connects Upper Silesia and Zaglebie with Kielce. The Starczynów Desert is located nearby, and wind-blown sands from the desert troubled the town until the desert was planted with trees in 1949 resulting in the desert becoming overgrown.

==History==

On the city&#x27;s website, a myth is cited that the city was founded by ancient Phoenicians (Canaanites) who traveled here and found lead ore. The origin of the name Olkusz is cited as the ancient Phoenician (Canaanite Hebrew) &quot;Elkhuds&quot; meaning &quot;to chisel&quot;. However, the Hebrew word for &quot;to chisel&quot; was &quot;lakhrot&quot; and the likelihood of the ancient Phoenicians having reached Poland is very low.

A first written historical document from the year 1299 refers to the city of Olkusz, although it was granted town rights earlier. It was located within the Seniorate Province of the fragmented Kingdom of Poland, and then it was a royal town of Poland, administratively located in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The inhabitants were mostly wealthy, due to the lead mines. Silver was discovered too. Various wars crossed the path of this town, which was at its lowest at the end of the 17th century (see: The Deluge).

In the Third Partition of Poland (1795) the town was annexed by Austria. Following the Austro-Polish War of 1809 it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and after the duchy&#x27;s dissolution in 1815, the town fell to the Russian Partition of Poland. Fights of the Polish January Uprising took place in the area in 1863. Francesco Nullo, hero of the fights for Italian and Polish independence died in the Battle of Krzykawka nearby, and then was buried at the cemetery in Olkusz.

Poland eventually regained independence and control of the town after World War I in 1918.

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was invaded by Germany. Already during the invasion, the Germans committed the first executions of local Poles (see also &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;).

Under German occupation, the town was annexed directly into Germany. Poles from Olkusz were among the victims of a massacre committed in Celiny in June 1940. On 16 July 1940, in retaliation for the killing of a German policeman, the Germans carried out a massacre of 20 Polish hostages. On 31 July 1940, the Germans gathered all Polish and Jewish men aged 15 to 55 and subjected them to torture and murder. The German terror campaign against the local population was aimed at the planned Germanisation of the town and the region. The occupation ended in January 1945, and the town was restored to Poland.

<text>Chrzanów () is a town in southern Poland with 35,651 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship (since 1999) and is the seat of Chrzanów County.

==History==

===History to 1809===
It is impossible to establish a reliable date for the foundation of the town. A stronghold existed on the site, which was later raised to the rank of a castellany. The earliest documents which corroborate the existence of Chrzanów castellany come from the late 12th century when, in around 1178, Chrzanów castellany was annexed to Silesia by order of Duke Casimir II the Just. In the second half of the 13th century it was reunited with the Duchy of Kraków. In 1241 the wooden stronghold of Chrzanów was put to the torch by Mongol hordes invading Poland from the east. The town of Chrzanów was rebuilt according to the Magdeburg Law in the mid-14th century under the reign of King Casimir III the Great. However it seems that it was not surrounded by defence walls. It is believed that Chrzanów was an open town. The local church was mentioned for the first time in documents in the tax-register of Peter&#x27;s Pence, 1325-1328. From the time of its construction in the 14th century until 1640 the town was the property of the Ligęza family of the Półkozic coat of arms. In the mid-15th century Chrzanów had c. 430 residents and in the 17th century some 650. At least from the early 15th century a parish school existed next to Chrzanów&#x27;s Church of St Nicholas.

In the 16th century King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland bestowed a new privilege on the town, allowing for four extra fairs. Various guilds were active in the town: weavers&#x27;, tailors&#x27;, shoemakers&#x27;, smiths&#x27;, butchers&#x27; and others. Ancient Chrzanów&#x27;s speciality was trading cattle, as here was a customs house for exports of cattle to Silesia and ore trade which was mined and smelted by Chrzanów&#x27;s burghers. In 1640 Chrzanów was taken over by Andrzej Samuel Dembiński. Then in 1649 it was inherited by his granddaughter Katarzyna Grudzińska, and in 1675 by the Stadnicki family. In 1731 it went to Józef Kanty Ossoliński. In 1654 King John II Casimir bestowed upon Chrzanów the privilege of holding extra fairs and in 1781 a similar privilege was bestowed on the town by King Stanislaus II Augustus. The second half of the 17th century was a particularly hard period for Chrzanów. As a result of wars waged at the time the town was looted on several occasions by the Swedes (1655–1657), the Austrians who fought against them (1657), by Transylvanian troops of Prince George Rákóczi and by Polish troops as well. During the Great Northern War Chrzanów was plundered and put to the torch by Swedish troops of King Charles XII. During the Polish-Russian war which broke out in 1792, Chrzanów was occupied by Russian (1792–1793) and Prussian troops (1793–1795). In 1795, following the third partition of Poland-Lithuania, Chrzanów was annexed to Galicia in the Habsburg Empire.

===1809-1918===
In the period 1795-1809 Chrzanów was a part of Austrian Galicia. In 1809, as a result of the war between Austria and the Duchy of Warsaw, West Galicia with Chrzanów was annexed to the Duchy of Warsaw. During this period ownership of the town also changed. From 1804 to 1822 Chrzanów was owned by Duke Albert Casimir of Saxe-Cieszyn, son of the late King of Poland, Augustus III of Saxony. Following the fall of Napoleon, a treaty among Austria, Prussia and Russia was concluded during the Congress of Vienna resulting in creation of the Free City of Kraków on 3 May 1815. Chrzanów and the surrounding areas are annexed to the newly created state. In 1838 Chrzanów had 4078 residents: 2009 of the Roman-Catholic and 2069 of the Jewish faith. The period of the Free City of Cracow was a time of prosperity and rapid development for Chrzanów and its residents. In this period ownership of the town changed again. The former owner, Duke Albert Casimir of Saxe-Cieszyn, bequeathed the town to Archduke Karl Ludwig of Austria (1822), who in turn sold it to the Cracovian Senator and MP from Chrzanów Jan Mieroszewski. In 1856 Mieroszewski decided to sell his Chrzanów estate to a group of Wrocław entrepreneurs, one of whom, Emanuel Loewenfeld, soon became the sole owner.

In 1846, a revolt broke out in Kraków. Outside Kraków, Austrian troops were also engaged in battle at Chrzanów where in February 1846 a 15-troop squad commanded by the owner of Kwaczała estate, Józef Patelski, victoriously attacked Austrian troops forcing them to withdraw. The revolt was doomed, however, and in September 1846 Chrzanów with the entire Free City of Cracow was annexed to the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia. In 1853/54 Galicia was divided into counties () and Chrzanów became a seat of a county. In 1847 the first part of the railway running through Chrzanów County was built: from Cracow to Silesia with railway stations in Krzeszowice, Trzebinia and Szczakowa. In 1856 another section was built joining Cracow with Vienna and this one ran through Chrzanów. In 1852 a zinc and lead ore mine &quot;Matilda&quot; was opened in the direct vicinity. Chrzanów entered the age of rapid industrialization. With it the number of residents grew. In 1870 the town had 6,323 inhabitants, 7,712 in 1890, 10,000 in 1900 and 11,572 in 1910. Henry Avenue (&quot;Aleja Henryka&quot;) was built in 1893 following a purchase of land situated between modern Henry Avenue and Oświęcimska St. from the Lowenfeld family. This initiated dynamic development of the town in S-W direction and intensive urbanization of the neighbourhood continued in the interwar period. In 1911 Chrzanów Secondary School was founded. Following Austria-Hungary&#x27;s collapse in 1918 Chrzanów with the rest of Galicia was reunited with the Republic of Poland.

===1918-1945===
In the years 1919-1939 Chrzanów and Chrzanów County belonged to the Province of Cracow (Voivodeship) in the Second Polish Republic. In the interwar years further industrialization of the town followed. In the 1920s Stella ceramic works and Fablok, the First Locomotive Factory in Poland, were founded. Many residents found employment there. The interwar years was the period of dynamic urbanization. A number of public buildings were constructed then (the Józef Piłsudski County Hospital, the Józef Piłsudski Children&#x27;s House, a new building of Chrzanów Secondary School etc.), a residential area between Henry Avenue and Oświęcimska St. and housing estates at Kolonia Fabryczna and Rospontowa constructed for the employees of Fablok works. The population of the town in 1921 was 12,244 and 18,106 according to the 1931 census. In 1939 the number of residents was 22,000.

With the outbreak of World War II (1 September 1939) the town was flooded with refugees from Upper Silesia. In the morning of 3 September Polish local government was evacuated from the town, as well as many residents. The following day, after a number of short skirmishes with the Polish troops, the town was occupied by German troops. In November 1939 when the town with the western half of the county was annexed directly to Nazi Germany, Chrzanów was made a county town in the Katowice region of the Province of Upper Silesia.

In 1940 the German authorities began expropriating Polish families from better houses in the town. These were given to German officials, military, policemen and German settlers from Romania. The Nazis started removing any Polish traces in the town with particular pettiness. Public buildings and shops had all signs written in Polish removed and all streets received German names. In 1941 the town itself was renamed &quot;Krenau&quot;. Jewish residents were resettled to a ghetto, created in 1941. It was not surrounded by walls, like in other Polish towns, nevertheless the Jews were not allowed to venture outside the ghetto. From 1942 the Germans started sending Chrzanów&#x27;s Jews to the death camp in Auschwitz-Birkenau. The last transport of Jews from Chrzanów to Birkenau was organized by the Germans in February 1943.

On 29 April 1942 the Germans hanged seven Jews in Krzyska Street in Chrzanow. The seven Jews were accused of illegally baking bread. The victims were Israel Gerstner (bakery owner), Chaim Gerstner, Szymszen Gerstner, Szaja Szpangelet, Fajwel Waloman, Israel Frisz and an unknown man from Olkusz.

German occupation was terminated on 24 January 1945 when Chrzanów was taken over by Soviet troops of the 1st Ukrainian Front. The town escaped serious damage in this last chapter of its war history (about one-fourth of the town was damaged). The population decreased by almost half. From 30 January 1945 the town was administered first by the Town Council and then by the National Town Council. Due to ruthless political methods, local administration was soon seized by the local and incoming communists, although the communists themselves constituted a tiny fraction of the politically active residents.

===Since 1945===
In 1949, Chrzanów had almost 15,000 residents, increasing to 20,000 in 1960, to over 30,000 in 1975 and to 53,000 in 1993. After 1945, new enterprises were created in the town (e.g. a dairy, a cold storage plant, a slaughterhouse) and new residential areas (housing estates - from 1961, - from 1979, and so on) and cultural centres (e.g. County Cultural Centre, the construction of which was initiated in 1959, and Chrzanów Museum founded in 1960). In 1970-71 a new town centre was constructed focusing around the Millennium Square () and the Victory and Liberty Monument. In 1975, following an administrative reform abolishing counties (), Chrzanów ceased to be a county seat. Further, the town was detached from its original Province of Cracow, to which it belonged since restoration of Poland&#x27;s independence after World War I, and annexed to the Province of Katowice until 1999. Since 1999 Chrzanów has been a county seat in Małopolskie, or Lesser Poland Voivodeship.

===Number of inhabitants by year===

==Main sights==

*Church of St Nicholas, most probably constructed at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries Its final architectural shape - as it then seemed, as it survived only until 1912 - had been created in the 15th century and shortly afterwards by adding annexes. A detached belfry was erected next to the church most probably around the same time. The present church was created by extensive reconstruction in 1912-1914. The interior decoration consist of several interesting altars with old paintings, arrestingly beautiful stained glass windows from 1914, grand chandelier from the 1930s and many other interesting historic objects.
*The Loewenfeld Mausoleum, built in 1898-1900 in Neo-Classical style on the Greek cross plan, according to a design of Teodor Talowski from Kraków. The chapel was raised as the mausoleum of the last owners of Chrzanów, the Loewenfelds.
*Market Square with residences from the late 18th and 19th centuries. Probably the most interesting of those is a 1905-1907 two-storey, Art-Nouveau house at nr 13 (previously nr 22). It has a façade of glazed bricks opulently decorated with miscellaneous ornaments (mostly chestnut foliage).
*The Victory and Liberty Monument at the Tysiąclecia Sq. (locally known as &quot;The Eagle&quot;) by the Chrzanovian sculptor Marian Konarski. It was raised in 1971 in memory of the residents of Chrzanów who fell during World War II.
*The castle granary from the 16th century, now the seat of the Chrzanów Museum. The building was originally a part of the manor assembly (called the Castle), which in turn was the residence of the owners of Chrzanów. Since 1960 the building has housed collections of the Chrzanów Museum, including mementos of the last owners, the Loewenfelds. The Museum has an interesting collections on local history divided into several sections.
*The Church of St John the Baptist in Kościelec had been built probably in the 14th century in Gothic style and it was preserved as such until 1843/45 when a decision was made for a general reconstruction of the church due to its rather poor shape. Among other interesting furnishings of the church is the 19th-century high altar and black Dębniki marble epitaphs of the former owners of Kościelec, which until the recent renovation used to be on the walls of the presbytery. The church has a richly adorned bell of 1484.
*The Building of the Credit Society (1895) in Henry Avenue, with rich eclectic details including two porches with column porticos which make the whole structure look quite handsome.
*Jewish cemetery (c. 1763) with 19th- and 20th-century tombstones. Initially it had consisted of two cemeteries, the small one (which was destroyed by the Germans in 1941) and the big one which has been preserved down to our own days (small part of which, however, was destroyed by the Germans during World War II).
* World War I cemetery behind / adjacent to the Jewish cemetery of 1914/15 with approx. 170 interred, mainly Austro-Hungarian soldiers who died in the Chrzanów military hospitals. The site has been cleaned, a simple cross with the names of the interred erected in 2014, and restoration is envisaged to be completed by 2018.

==Flag and coat of arms==
The ancient coat of arms of Chrzanów, the St Nicholas, was created perhaps in the 14th century simultaneously with granting the Magdeburg Rights to Chrzanów. The oldest preserved seals of the town of Chrzanów are charged with an effigy of St Nicholas, the patron-saint of the local church, who holds a crosier in his right hand and a book in his left and wears bishop&#x27;s vestments and a bishop&#x27;s mitre on his head. Next to St Nicholas the Półkozic crest is seen which was the arms of the Ligęza Family, the former owners of Chrzanów. This coat of arms had been used by the town until c. 1809, when the authorities of the Duchy of Warsaw to which Chrzanów belonged to then, annulled all municipal coats-of-arms. Following the fall of the Duchy of Warsaw (1815) the arms of the Duchy was adopted as the arms of Chrzanów. It is unclear why the ancient and traditional arms were not restored. The arms of the Duchy of Warsaw, adopted after 1815 as the arms of Chrzanów, were a shield divided in half and placed under a royal crown. In the right field of the shield were the arms of Saxony (black and golden stripes divided by a green crown-shaped half-wreath). In the left field were the coat of arms of Poland.

In 1964 the flag of Chrzanów was adopted. During the session of the City Council on 21 May 1964 it was decided that the city colours would be blue and red put in two horizontal stripes, exactly like the colours of the Polish national flag. It seems quite probable that the choice of colours had been determined by the dominant colours in the old arms of Chrzanów featuring St Nicholas, and that is why such colours were adopted. In 2009 a new flag of Chrzanów was introduced. It consists of 3 vertical stripes: a broad white one, centrally located and featuring the city&#x27;s arms and two narrower pale blue stripes flanking the central stripe on both sides.

Chrzanów has, among others, seven primary schools, two secondary schools, a secondary technical school, a music school and the Academy of Business and Marketing (Wyższa Szkoła Przedsiębiorczości i Marketingu).

<text>Knurów (; ; ) is a city near Katowice in Silesia, southern Poland. Knurów is an outer city of the Metropolis GZM, a metropolis with a population of two million.

Knurów is located in the Silesian Highlands, on the Bierawka River, a tributary of the Oder River.

==History==
Knurów&#x27;s history as a city is relatively short, as it only became a town in 1951, when also the settlements of Krywałd and were included within its town limits as districts. However, Knurów&#x27;s existence can be traced back as far back as ca. 1295–1305, when it was mentioned in the &quot;Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis&quot; chronicle, and was part of Piast-ruled Poland. It was then mentioned as &quot;Knauersdorf&quot; or &quot;Cnurowicz&quot;, and later on mostly appeared in documents under its current name. Later on, it was also part of Bohemia (Czechia), Prussia and Germany. Throughout centuries, Knurów was a private village, and among its owners were the Goszycki, Węgierski and Paczyński families. The town rapidly grew at the end of the 18th century as the Industrial Revolution came and vast coal reserves were found in the area. In the late 19th century, the settlement had a population of 776. In 1904, the first mine shaft was opened, and in 1908-1909 a railway line connecting Knurów with Rybnik was built. In 1912, the first strike took place at the local mine.
After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence, and following the Polish Silesian Uprisings Knurów was reintegrated with Poland. In the interwar period, Knurów developed intensively. New schools, stadiums, a pipeline connecting with Bełk and the first synthetic ammonia plant in Poland were built. In 1923, a monument to the participants of the Silesian Uprisings was unveiled. The coal industry continued growing well in the 20th century, and doubled its output with a new mine being built in 1961 in Szczygłowice.

Knurów and the present-day districts of Krywałd and Szczygłowice were invaded by Germany on September 1, 1939, the first day of the invasion of Poland and World War II. Already in early September 1939, German troops committed a massacre of four Poles in Szczygłowice (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). During the subsequent German occupation, the occupiers established and operated two forced labour subcamps (E75, E758) of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the town. A unit of the Home Army, the leading Polish resistance organization, was founded in Knurów in 1942. In January 1945, it was captured by the Soviets, who established a transit camp for local Polish Silesians who were deported to the Soviet Union (see &quot;Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939–1946)&quot;). Knurów was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which then stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

In 1951, Knurów was granted town rights. Several new schools were opened between 1964 and 1991, and new Catholic parishes were established in 1977–1983. More recently, in May 2015, riots ensued in the town after a Concordia Knurów fan was shot dead by police during a football match.

==Population==
Knurów is one of the cities of the 2.7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the town is 38,310 (2019).

==Politics==

Administratively Knurów has been part of the Silesian Voivodeship since the latter&#x27;s formation in 1999; previously it was part of Katowice Voivodeship.

==Economy==

The town is usually associated with coal mining, as it lies in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. The coal mine was established in 1903 in Knurów on the initiative of Gustav von Velsen, who was a ministerial director at the Department of Mining in Berlin. In 2019, the mine was connected to the Szczygłowice Coal Mine.

==Sport==
The town is home to Concordia Knurów, a lower league football club which was founded in 1923, and famously where Jerzy Dudek started his career. Another famous athlete Agnieszka Dubiel, was a professional sailor for many years. She managed to stay in National Sailing Team and represent Poland on many European and World Championships. Her best result was 21st on Youth World Championship 2014.

The route of the 2016 Tour de Pologne cycling race ran through the town.

<text>Zawiercie () () is a town in southern Poland located in the Silesian Voivodeship with 49,334 inhabitants (2019). It is situated in the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland near the source of the Warta River. The town lies near the historical region of Silesia, but belongs to Lesser Poland.

==Name and location==
Zawiercie, even though currently associated with Silesia, belongs to Lesser Poland. The town lies near the source of the Warta river, and its name probably comes from the location. The inhabitants of the ancient village of Kromołów, to reach another village located on the other side of the river, would go &quot;behind the Warta&quot;, or in Polish - &quot;za Wartę&quot;. From the perspective of Kromołów, Zawiercie is located behind the Warta. There is also a theory that the name of the city comes from settlers who &quot;zawiercili&quot; (or circled) the settlement area. The town is a gateway to the Polish Jura, where several castles, which used to defend western border of Lesser Poland, are located.

Zawiercie has the area of 85 square kilometers, and until 1945, the town was administratively tied with Lesser Poland&#x27;s Kielce. It is located along the Warsaw–Vienna railway, and is a road hub, on the National Road Nr. 78.

==History==
First mention of the village of Kromołów (now a district of Zawiercie) comes from 1193. In the 14th century, the village was located in western Lesser Poland, along a merchant road from Kraków to Poznań. In 1431, Duke Bolko IV of Opole allowed a man named Mikołaj Czenar to open an inn here, and in his document, the name Zawiercie is mentioned for the first time. In the 15th century, the area became the early center of iron manufacturing, but despite this Zawiercie remained for centuries a small village. It was administratively located in the Lelów County in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Until the 19th century, it was divided into &quot;Zawiercie Małe&quot; (&quot;Small Zawiercie&quot;) and &quot;Zawiercie Duże&quot; (&quot;Big Zawiercie&quot;), both administratively belonged to the gmina of Kromołów.

In 1795 Zawiercie was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Third Partition of Poland, becoming part of the small province of New Silesia. In the 1807 Treaties of Tilsit it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, a French client state in a personal union with the Kingdom of Saxony. In 1815 it passed to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Zawiercie owes its development to the construction of the railroads. On December 1, 1847 the first train came to the village, along the newly built Warsaw–Vienna railway. This gave Zawiercie a boost, and in the second half of the 19th century, several companies and coal mines were opened in the village, including &quot;Zawiercie Steel Plant&quot;, opened in 1901. In 1878, construction of a settlement for workers was initiated, with schools, parks and churches. In 1894, Polish Socialist Party organized a mass sit-in at Zawiercie&#x27;s &quot;Cotton Plant&quot;, and by 1914, the population of the village grew to 30,000. Zawiercie finally got its town charter on July 1, 1915. After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and the town was reintegrated with Poland.
World War I and the 1920s was a bad time for Zawiercie. Unemployment grew, the steel plant closed and the TAZ factory reduced the number of workers. The situation did not improve until 1927 when Zawiercie County, part of Kielce Voivodeship, was created.

On the eve of the Second World War there were 7,000 Jews in Zawiercie – about a quarter of its residents. They made their living primarily from trade, crafts, the clothing industry and the metal industry. Printing houses owned by Jews played a central role in the cultural life in the city. The city had labor unions which were composed of small traders and artisans, as well as two banks, a charitable fund companies and charities. Between the World Wars in Zawiercie there were various Zionist parties and Agudat Israel. The city had a traditional “cheder” (religious primary school), a Talmud Torah, and a school and kindergarten which were part of the &quot;Tarbut&quot; Network. In 1926, A. Bornstein who was head of the Jewish community was also appointed mayor of the town.

There were Pogroms were Zawiercie in 1919 and in 1921 which killed some Jews, and most of the city&#x27;s Jews were affected – whether physically or having suffered material damage.

===World War II===
During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the Germans entered Zawiercie on 4 September 1939. The town was directly annexed to the Upper Silesia Province (&quot;Regierungsbezirk Oppeln&quot;), and its name was changed to &quot;Warthenau&quot; to erase traces of Polish origin. The Polish and Jewish population was subjected to various repressions and crimes. The Germans established and operated a Nazi prison in the town, and also began kidnapping Poles and Jews for forced labour and acts of abuse. On 27 September 1939, the Germans imposed on the Jewish population a high ransom payment. In autumn of 1939, the Polish secret resistance organization &quot;Płomień&quot; was established, with its headquarters in the local trade school. Among its members were teachers, local officials, students, scouts, the trade school principal Wacław Chrzanowski and local parish priest Bolesław Wajzler. The organization issued underground Polish press, financially supported poorest families and tried to save the youth from being deported to forced labour to Germany.

At the beginning of 1940 the Germans confiscated all Jewish businesses. On January 5, 1940, they imposed a fine of 10 zloty for every Jewish resident of the city. In April 1940, 600 Jewish refugees from Cieszyn were brought to Zawiercie. In April–May 1940, over 150 Poles from Zawiercie were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre. On September 18, 1940, the Gestapo carried out mass arrests of over 100 members of the &quot;Płomień&quot; organization, who were then either sentenced to death and executed or imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps, where many died.

In the winter of 1940/41 the Jews were required to hand over all valuables, furniture and furs. On 22 July 1941, the Germans murdered seven Jews who were accused of communism. The Jewish population in 1941 was 5,500. In September 1941, a ghetto was created and a Judenrat (Jewish committee) was established. The Judenrat had to supply the Germans forced labor. In the “Aktion” in Zawiercie in May or August 1942, SS, Gestapo and German gendarmes, aided by the Blue Police, deported about 2,000 residents of the ghetto to the Auschwitz concentration camp. In early 1943, a factory to manufacture uniforms of the German Air Force was created and about 2500 Jews worked there.
At the end of 1942 an underground group was formed in Zawiercie by the &quot;Hashomer HaTzair&quot; (Zionist Youth Movement) led by Berl Schwartz. Mordechai Anielewicz (commander of Warsaw Ghetto Uprising) from Warsaw visited the underground. The Underground assisted some Jewish families to escape across the border into Slovakia. Some of those smuggled across were captured and murdered.
Zawiercie ghetto was liquidated in August 1943. SS, Gestapo, German gendarmes, and Blue Police deported to Auschwitz 6,000–7,000 Jews as well as locals and refugees who were brought from other places. Judenrat members were killed in the city before deportation. At the uniform factory there remained about 500 workers whose deportation was postponed since they were considered essential employees, and they were deported to Auschwitz on 18 October 1943.

German occupation ended in January 1945 and the town was restored to Poland. Afterwards Zawiercie was transferred from Kielce Voivodeship to Katowice Voivodeship.

==Zawiercie and Warsaw-Vienna Railway==

In 1847, the Warsaw-Vienna Railway was completed. The railroad connection facilitated the trade between Russia, Germany and Austria. The fact that Zawiercie was located less than one kilometre from the railroad triggered the rapid development of the region. Twenty-five years later, there were coal and iron ore mines in Zawiercie and an industry was developed around the mines in the town. The first industrial plant, a glass factory, started around 1870. Immediately other industries followed; a large cotton spinnery, large weaving mill, iron mining, cast iron, brick manufacturing, sawmill, chemical laboratories, steam and water flour mills, machining, etc. The flourishing economics accelerated the local population growth.

<doc id="387096" wikidata="Q45197" url="?curid=387096" title="Świętochłowice">
<text>Świętochłowice (; ; ) is a city with powiat rights in Silesia in southern Poland, near Katowice. It is also one of the central cities of the Metropolis GZM, with a population of 2 million, and is located in the Silesian Highlands, on the Rawa River (tributary of the Vistula).

It is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously in Katowice Voivodeship, and before then, of the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Świętochłowice is one of the cities of the 2.7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the city is 49,762 (2019).

==History==
Initially, Świętochłowice was divided into two parts: the older Małe Świętochłowice (&quot;Little Świętochłowice&quot;) and newer Duże Świętochłowice (&quot;Big Świętochłowice&quot;), which date back to the 12th and 13th centuries, respectively. The oldest known mention of Świętochłowice comes from 1313, while the present-day district of Chropaczów was mentioned in 1295. Both settlements were located within the Duchy of Bytom of fragmented Poland and remained under the rule of the Piast dynasty until 1532, as part of the duchies of Bytom and Opole, before passing to the Kingdom of Bohemia. The village received Magdeburg rights at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. Until the end of the 17th century, the village of Świętochłowice was owned by the families of Świętochłowski, Paczyński, Kamieński, Rotter, Skall, Myszkowski and Guznar.
In 1742 the settlement was annexed by Prussia and from 1871 to 1922 it was part of Germany. Both parts of Świętochłowice merged in 1790. In the 19th and first part of the 20th century the area rapidly industrialized (based on the numerous local resources, including coal and zinc), leading to the transformation of the village into an industrial settlement. In the early 20th century, numerous Polish organizations were established there. During the Silesian Uprisings the present-day districts Lipiny and were captured by the Polish insurgents in 1920. In the 1921 Upper Silesia plebiscite, in Świętochłowice 51.9% voted for Germany, while in Chropaczów 70.0% voted for Poland, and in Lipiny and Piaśniki combined 56.4% voted for Poland. In 1922 all named settlements were integrated with the re-established Polish state. In 1929 Zgoda became part of Świętochłowice as its new district. In 1939 Świętochłowice was granted city rights with effect from January 1, 1940, however, due to outbreak of World War II, the actual implementation of this law did not take place until 1947.

In early September 1939, during the German invasion of Poland which started World War II, Świętochłowice was the site of Polish defense, also by the civilian population.

<text>Będzin (; also seen spelled &quot;Bendzin&quot;; ) is a city in the Dąbrowa Basin, in southern Poland. It lies in the Silesian Highlands, on the Czarna Przemsza River (a tributary of the Vistula). Even though part of Silesian Voivodeship, Będzin belongs to historic Lesser Poland, and it is one of the oldest towns of this region. Będzin is regarded as the capital of industrial Dąbrowa Basin.

It has been situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999. Before 1999, it was located in the Katowice Voivodeship. Będzin is one of the cities of the 2.7 million conurbation - Katowice urban area and within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the city itself as of December 2021 is 55,183.

Będzin is located from Katowice and from the center of Sosnowiec. Together with Sosnowiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Czeladź, Wojkowice, Sławków and Siewierz it is a part of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, a highly industrialized and densely populated part of western Lesser Poland. Będzin borders the cities of Sosnowiec, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Czeladź, Siemianowice Śląskie, and Wojkowice, as well as the village of Psary. The highest point of the town is St. Dorothy Mountain above sea level, and the area of Będzin is .

==Districts==
Będzin is divided into eight districts: &quot;Grodziec&quot; in 1951–1975 was a separate town, &quot;Gzichów&quot; is part of Będzin since 1915, &quot;Ksawera&quot; is part of Będzin since 1923, &quot;Łagisza&quot; in 1967–1973 was a separate town, &quot;Małobądz&quot; is part of Będzin since 1915, &quot;Śródmieście&quot; is the historic center, &quot;Warpie&quot; is part of Będzin since 1923.

==Etymology==
The name Będzin most probably comes from ancient Polish given name &quot;Beda&quot; or &quot;Bedzan&quot;. In the past, the town was also called Banden, Bandin, Bandzien, Bondin, Bandzen, Bandzin, Badzin, Bendzin, and Bendsburg (1939–1945).

==History==
First mention of the village of Będzin comes from 1301, but a settlement (or a grod) had existed here since the 9th century, guarding ancient trade route from Kyiv to Western Europe. In the 1340s, a town was founded here, with King Casimir III the Great building a stone strongpoint. On August 5, 1358, Będzin was incorporated as a town, and became a royal city of Poland, administratively located in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province.

In the Jagiellonian period Będzin, located on the border between Lesser Poland and Silesia, was a major trade center. In 1565 King Sigismund II Augustus allowed the town to have five markets a week, and in 1589, at Będzin Castle, Polish–Austrian negotiations took place. At that time, a Jewish community already existed here. In 1655, during The Deluge, both town and castle were destroyed by the Swedes, and Będzin did not recover from the destruction for many years. Following the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795 the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, and was included within the newly established province of New Silesia. In 1807 it was regained by Poles and included in the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw and in 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland.

===Industrial revolution===

In the late 18th century rich deposits of coal were found in the area. In the 19th century, Będzin and its vicinity enjoyed a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization. New settlements and towns were founded, and the region of Zagłębie Dąbrowskie was established in southwestern corner of Congress Poland. In 1858, Będzin got its first rail connection, due to construction of the Warsaw–Vienna railway. The town increased in population and size, when town limits were expanded by including neighboring settlements. During the January Uprising, in February 1863, Będzin was captured by Polish insurgents after their victory in the Battle of Sosnowiec nearby.
The Będzin Power Station was opened in 1913.
Będzin was eventually restored to Poland, when the country regained independence in 1918, after World War I. In the Second Polish Republic Będzin was an important center of local administration and industry. New rail station, waterworks, schools and offices were built.

===World War II===
During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the Wehrmacht entered Będzin on September 4, 1939, and in the following days the Germans committed the first atrocities in the city. On September 6, the Germans murdered 20 Poles, and on September 9, they murdered 100 Jews, set fire to the synagogue and Jewish houses, and then in attempt to blame the Poles they arrested and executed 42 Poles. Local Polish parish priest rescued a group of Jews who escaped the German massacre by opening the gates of the Holy Trinity church to them and giving them shelter. The German police carried out mass searches of Polish houses. Inhabitants of Będzin were also among Poles murdered in Celiny in June 1940. The Będzin Ghetto was established by the German occupational authority in July 1940. During the occupation, the city&#x27;s name was changed to a German form, &quot;Bendsburg&quot;, and it was part of Upper Silesia Province, as the capital of &quot;Landkreis Bendsburg&quot;.

During the war the city was the base for a working party (E716) of British and Commonwealth prisoners of war, under the administration of Stalag VIII-B/344 at Łambinowice (then known as &quot;Lamsdorf&quot;). In January 1945, as the Soviet armies resumed their offensive and advanced from the east, the prisoners were marched westward in the so-called Long March or Death March. Many of them died from the bitter cold and exhaustion. The lucky ones got far enough to the west to be liberated by the allied armies after some four months of travelling on foot in appalling conditions. Their sufferings, though severe, pale by comparison to those of the Jews of Będzin (see below). In 1943–1944, the Germans also operated a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp in the present-day district of Łagisza, in which they held and brutalized from 300 to over 700 prisoners as forced labourers.

In August 1943, as the Germans attempted to round up the last Jews still in Będzin, Jewish resistance fighters staged an armed revolt that lasted several days. One of the leaders was a woman, Frumka Plotnicka, who had earlier been a fighter in Warsaw in the ghetto revolt there. All the resistance fighters were killed in the action. More than 1000 Będzin Jews survived the war, several given help by local Poles.

On January 27, 1945, the town was captured by the Red Army. Subsequently, the castle was rebuilt, now housing the &quot;Museum of Zagłębie&quot;. New districts with blocks of flats were built and new factories were opened, including the Łagisza Power Station.

===Jewish community===

Until World War II, Będzin had a vibrant Jewish community. Bedzin was known as &quot;Yerushalayim de Zeglembie&quot; (&quot;Jerusalem of Zagłębie). According to the Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 21,200, Jews constituted 10,800 (around 51% percent). According to the Polish census of 1921 the town had a Jewish community consisting of 17,298 people, or 62.1 percent of its total population. In September 1939, the German Army (Wehrmacht) overran this area, followed by the SS death squads (Einsatzgruppen), who burned the Będzin synagogue and murdered 200 Jewish inhabitants. A Będzin Ghetto was created in 1942. Eventually, in the summer of 1943, most of the Jews in Będzin were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp. After World War II, the Mizrachi synagogue was used as a storage room by residents of the building until its discovery by a member of the city council who became interested in preserving the city&#x27;s Jewish heritage. The synagogue has since been renovated and is open to visitors who register in advance. Close by is another synagogue, Brama Cukerman (Cukerman&#x27;s Gate), which had been turned into a residential apartment and has also been restored.

==Transport==
Będzin is conveniently located at the intersection of two national roads - the 94th (Zgorzelec - Kraków), and the 86th (Katowice -Warsaw). Katowice International Airport is located away, at Pyrzowice. The town also is a rail hub, where two connections meet. Będzin has three rail stations (&quot;Będzin-Miasto&quot;, &quot;Będzin&quot; and &quot;Będzin-Ksawera&quot;), and convenient bus and tram connections to neighboring cities. The first tram line was opened there in 1928. At that time the Black Przemsza River which runs through the city was also an important transport hub. The &quot;Black&quot; Przemsza is so named because the river bed as it flows through Będzin exposes a coal seam, making the water above it appear black.

==Sports==
The city&#x27;s most notable sports club is volleyball team MKS Będzin, which competes in the PlusLiga (Poland&#x27;s top division). Other clubs include association football teams and , which compete in the lower leagues, and American football team Zagłębie Steelers.

<text>Racibórz (, , , ) is a city in Silesian Voivodeship in southern Poland. It is the administrative seat of Racibórz County.

With Opole, Racibórz is one of the historic capitals of Upper Silesia, being the residence of the Dukes of Racibórz from 1172 to 1521.

==Geography==
The city is situated in the southwest of the voivodeship on the upper Oder river, near the border with the Polish Opole Voivodeship and the Czech Republic. The Racibórz Basin (&quot;Kotlina Raciborska&quot;) forms the southeastern extension of the Silesian Lowlands, surrounded by the Opawskie Mountains in the west (part of the Eastern Sudetes), the Silesian Upland in the north, and the Moravian Gate in the south. The town centre is located about southwest of Katowice and about southeast of the regional capital Wrocław.

As of 2019, the city has a population of approximately 55,000 inhabitants. From 1975 to 1998, it belonged to Katowice Voivodeship.

==History==
Until the end of the 5th century AD, the lands of the later Racibórz settlement were inhabited by East Germanic Silinger tribes. The town is one of the oldest in Upper Silesia, the site of a hill fort where the old trade route from the Moravian Gate down to Kraków crossed the Oder river. There is a possibility that Racibórz was mentioned in a work of the &quot;Bavarian Geographer&quot; in 845 (this document mentions five strongholds of the Slavic Golensizi (Golenshitse, &quot;Holasici&quot; in Czech), a proto-Polish tribe, probably Racibórz was one of them). The name Racibórz is of Slavic origin and probably is derived from the name of one Duke Racibor, the city&#x27;s founder.

===Middle Ages===

However, the first confirmed mention of Racibórz was made in 1108 in the &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; chronicle by the Benedictine monk Gallus Anonymus, at a time when the Polish duke Bolesław III Wrymouth had to ward off the attacks by the forces of Duke Svatopluk of Bohemia invading from the Moravian lands in the south. The Polish rule over the Racibórz area was confirmed in 1137, it was incorporated into the Duchy of Silesia according to the Testament of Bolesław III in the following year.

Racibórz was an important center of beer production, and the townspeople enjoyed a privilege that allowed brewing already in the early 12th century. Brewing was an important source of the town&#x27;s income, and local beer was popular not only in Silesia, but also in neighboring Czechia.

From 1155, Racibórz was the seat of a castellany. The town became the first historical capital of Upper Silesia, when the Duchy of Racibórz was established by the Piast duke Mieszko I Tanglefoot upon the first partition of Silesia in 1172. From 1202 onwards, Duke Mieszko ruled over whole Upper Silesia as Duke of Opole and Racibórz. He had the settlement beneath his residence laid out and the area colonized by Flemish merchants, the first coin with the Polish description &quot;MILOST&quot; was issued in Racibórz in 1211. Mieszko&#x27;s son and successor Duke Casimir I granted the Racibórz citizens municipal privileges in 1217.

In 1241, the Poles led by local Duke Mieszko II the Fat won the Battle of Racibórz during the first Mongol invasion of Poland and the Duke founded a Dominican monastery in the city, where he was buried in 1246. The first Polish national anthem &quot;Gaude Mater Polonia&quot; was written ca. 1260–70 in Latin by the Dominican brother Wincenty of Kielcza. In 1285 Duke Przemysław of Racibórz granted the Wrocław bishop Thomas II Zaremba asylum during his fierce struggle with the Silesian duke Henry IV Probus. In turn, Bishop Thomas donated a college of canons at Racibórz Castle, dedicated to Saint Thomas of Canterbury. Duke Przemysław also founded a Dominican nunnery and his daughter Euphemia became its first prioress in 1313. Around 1300, the Dominican friar Peregrine of Opole compiled his &quot;Sermones de tempore&quot; and &quot;Sermones de sanctis&quot; collections.
From 1299 onwards, Racibórz was ruled by an autonomous city council according to Magdeburg town law. When in 1327 Duke Leszek of Racibórz paid homage to the Luxembourg king John of Bohemia, his duchy became a Bohemian fiefdom. The Bohemian feudal suzerainty, confirmed in the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin, led to the seizure of Racibórz as a reverted fief, when the line of the Silesian Piasts became extinct upon Duke Leszek&#x27;s death in 1336. The next year King John enfeoffed Leszek&#x27;s brother-in-law Duke Nicholas II of Opava with the duchy, which from that time on was ruled by the Opava cadet branch of the Bohemian Přemyslid dynasty and incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. The Racibórz citizens retained their autonomy and the town developed to an important commercial centre for the region with significant cloth, tanning and brewing industries.

===Modern Era===

When the last Přemyslid duke Valentin died and was buried in the Dominican church in 1521, Racibórz according to a 1512 inheritance treaty fell to the Opole dukes Jan II the Good, also a vassal of Bohemian king. As he himself left no male heirs, his lands fell back to the Habsburg king Ferdinand I. With Opole, Racibórz was temporarily given in pawn to the Hohenzollern margraves of Ansbach and to the royal Polish House of Vasa. The town&#x27;s economy suffered from the devastations in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1683, on his way to the Battle of Vienna, Polish King John III Sobieski stopped in Racibórz, which he called a &quot;beautiful and fortified town&quot; in a letter to his wife Queen Marie Casimire.

After the First Silesian War in 1742, Racibórz was ceded to the Kingdom of Prussia under Frederick the Great. With most of the Silesian territory it was incorporated into the Province of Silesia in 1815 and the town became the administrative seat of a &quot;Landkreis&quot;. In the 18th century, Racibórz belonged to the tax inspection region of Prudnik. The mediate Lordship of Ratibor was acquired by Elector William I of Hesse in 1812, succeeded by Landgrave Victor Amadeus of Hesse-Rotenburg in 1821 and Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst in 1834, who was vested with the title of a &quot;Duke of Ratibor&quot; by King Frederick William IV of Prussia in 1840. At that time, Ratibor had already lost its status as a residential town, while the princes held court in Rudy palace in Rudy (then officially &quot;Groß Rauden&quot;). In the 19th century, Prussian policies increased the Germanisation. Poles smuggled large amounts of gunpowder through the town to the Russian Partition of Poland during the January Uprising in 1863. Ratibor became part of the German Empire in 1871.

===20th century===
According to the Prussian census of 1910, the city of Ratibor had a population of 38,424, of which around 60% spoke German, 30% spoke Polish and 10% were bilingual. After World War I, the Upper Silesian plebiscite was held in 1921, in which 90.9% of votes in Ratibor town were for Germany and 9.1% were for Poland. Consequently, the town remained in Germany, as part of the Prussian Province of Upper Silesia, and became a border town, while the present-day district of Brzezie, lying east of the Oder was reintegrated with Poland. Nazi Germany increasingly persecuted local Polish activists since 1937. In May 1939, the Germans searched the local branch of the Union of Poles in Germany and arrested both its secretary Leon Czogała and Ludwika Linderówna, activist of the local Association of Polish Women. In June 1939, the Gestapo seized the headquarters of local Polish organizations, which was then handed over to the Hitler Youth, while the Polish library and documents were confiscated.
During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town on September 4, 1939, to commit atrocities against Poles. In September 1939, the Germans confiscated assets of the local Polish bank, and carried out mass arrests of prominent Poles, including the chairman of the local &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society, the editor-in-chief of local Polish newspaper &quot;Dziennik Raciborski&quot;, the chairman of the local Polish bank and activists of the Association of Polish Women. During the war, the Germans operated a Nazi prison, a &quot;Polenlager&quot; forced labour camp for Poles, a forced labour camp for Jews, and six labour subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the town, and three labour subcamps of Stalag VIII-B/344 in the present-day district of Brzezie. In 1945, the Germans sent 176 prisoners of the Nazi prison on a death march to Kłodzko, and two German-conducted death marches of prisoners of the Auschwitz concentration camp and its subcamps passed through the town towards the Gross-Rosen concentration camp and Opava. In the final stages of the war, it was initially spared by the Red Army Vistula–Oder Offensive but occupied and devastated on 30 March 1945. After end of the war, in June 1945, the army of Czechoslovakia briefly entered into the town and Czechoslovakia officially claimed the area of Racibórz and Głubczyce (&quot;Ratibořsko&quot; and &quot;Hlubčicko&quot;) because of having a substantial Czech minority (see border conflicts between Poland and Czechoslovakia). At the same time the expulsion of Germans started, while the town became wholly part of Poland as defined at the Potsdam Conference. The German CDU politician Herbert Hupka at the end of his life promoted reconciliation between the former German inhabitants, including himself, and the new Polish settlers and administration of Racibórz. 

In 1997, a flood devastated the town. As a result, the Racibórz Dolny flood control reservoir located nearby the town was built and officially opened in 2020. The reservoir has the capacity of 185 million cubic meters and cost an estimated 2 billion zloty. It played a crucial role in protecting Racibórz and the cities of Opole and Wrocław from flooding during the 2024 Central European floods.

==Climate==
Racibórz has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm or a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) using the isotherm.

<text>Żory (; , , ) is a town and city county in Silesian Voivodeship, Poland with 62,848 inhabitants (2021). Previously it was in Katowice Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is located in the historic Upper Silesia region about southwest of Katowice.

==Location==
Żory is located in Upper Silesia on the Rybnik Plateau on the .

As of 31 December 2012, the city had a population of 62,052 and an area of 64.64 km².

As of 31 December 2013, the city had 59,960 inhabitants.

On 1 January 2014, the city of Żory increased its area at the expense of Rybnik by 0.26 ha.

Żory borders the counties of Mikołów, Pszczyna and Rybnik, as well as the cities of Jastrzębie-Zdrój and Rybnik.

As of 30 June 2016, the town had a population of 61,942.

==Name==
The meaning of the town&#x27;s name is not clear and there are two theories about it. The first one derives it from Old Polish, from annealing, burning of forests, which was the first stage of establishing a permanent settlement in a given place. This version is related to the primitive economy of burning, which was an element of deforestation of the area for settlement. The topographic description of Upper Silesia from 1865, in turn, derives it from the Polish name of the crane bird (&quot;Polish: żuraw)&quot;. It notes the following passage: &quot;In den verscheidenen Urkunden wird Sohrau einmal Żoraw, dann Żora und auch Sora genannt. Der Name ist polnischen Ursprungs.&quot;, that is, in English, &quot;In various documents notated as &quot;Żoraw&quot;, later &quot;Żora&quot;, and even &quot;Sora&quot;. The name is of Polish origin.&quot;

In the Latin book &quot;Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis&quot; written in 1295-1305, the town is mentioned as Zary civitate - the town of Zary. The chronicle also lists villages founded under the Polish law &quot;iure polonico&quot;, which in the course of urbanization were absorbed by the town. These are the present districts or parts of the town Żory as Rogoźna in the fragment &quot;Rogosina in una parte decima solvitur more polonico&quot;, Rowień in the fragment &quot;Rovona [Hs. Ronoua.] decima solvitur more polonico&quot;, Rój as Ray, Brodek in the fragment &quot;Brodek similiter solvitur decima more polonico.&quot;

The Polish name Żory and the German name Sohrau were mentioned by the Silesian writer Józef Lompa in his book &quot;Krótki rys jeografii Szląska dla nauki początkowej&quot; published in Głogówek in 1847. The geographic dictionary of the Kingdom of Poland published in 1880-1902 lists the town under the Polish name Żary and the German name Sohrau. The Polish name &quot;Żary&quot; and in the Upper Silesian dialect Żory, as well as the German name Sohrau are also mentioned in 1896 by the Upper Silesian writer, priest Konstanty Damrot, in his book about the local names in Upper Silesia. He also mentions Latinized names noted in Latin documents, such as &quot;Sary&quot; and &quot;Sari&quot;. A catalog of coats of arms of German localities, published in 1898 in Frankfurt am Main, identifies the Polish name as &quot;Zar&quot;.

==History==

The settlement on the road from Cieszyn to Kraków was first mentioned in a 1258 deed, when it was part of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. Żory is one of the oldest towns in Silesia, it was granted city rights according to Magdeburg Law on 24 February 1272 by Duke Władysław of Opole. It remained part of the Upper Silesian Duchy of Opole, since 1327 a Bohemian fief, until in 1532 it was incorporated into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. In 1645 along with the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz it returned to Poland under the House of Vasa, and in 1666 it fell back to Bohemia. In the 18th century, it was centre of cloth manufacturing, later of metal and machining industry.

After the First Silesian War it was annexed by Prussia in 1742, and from 1871 it was part of Germany. In the 18th century, Żory belonged to the tax inspection region of Prudnik. After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence, and upon the 1921 Upper Silesia plebiscite, Żory passed to the Second Polish Republic, and was administratively part of the Silesian Voivodeship, though 69.4% of the citizens had voted for Germany.

Żory was the site of a battle between Poles and the invading Germans on the first day of World War II, September 1, 1939. Afterwards it was occupied by Nazi Germany. From 1942 to 1945, the Germans operated a &quot;Polenlager&quot; forced labour camp for Poles in the city. Among its prisoners were children whose parents were either arrested or deported to Germany. Poles expelled in 1942 from several villages and the town of Szczyrk were also temporarily held in the camp before deportation to forced labour to Germany. In the final stages of the war, in January 1945, the Germans murdered 40 prisoners of the Auschwitz concentration camp in the city during a death march. The city was conquered by Soviet and Czechoslovak troops in March 1945, the German population was expelled, and the city was restored to Poland.

<text>Piekary Śląskie () () is a city in Silesia in southern Poland, near Katowice. One of the core cities of the Metropolis GZM – metropolis with the population of 2 million. Located in the Silesian Highlands, on the Brynica river (tributary of the Vistula).

It is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship. Piekary Śląskie is one of the cities of the 2.7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within a greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the city is 54,226 (2021).

Piekary is a spiritual center of Upper Silesia, a Marian shrine which is a pilgrimage site for thousands of the faithful, and a mining town.

==History==

Piekary Śląskie was created in 1934 in interwar Poland by merging the communes of Szarlej and Wielkie Piekary into Szarlej-Wielkie Piekary. In 1935 it was renamed Piekary Śląskie.

===Name and early history===
There are two legends about the founding of Piekary, according to one it was founded in the late 10th century, and according to the other it was founded by Polish ruler Casimir I the Restorer in 1041. The area formed part of Poland after the establishment of the state in the 10th century. Under the Latinized name of &quot;Pecare&quot;, the settlement was mentioned in a document by the bishop of Kraków Paweł of Przemankowo from 1277. The name is of Polish origin. It derives from the word &quot;piekarz&quot; (meaning &quot;baker&quot;), referring to possible bakers baking bread here for the nearby city of Bytom or from the word &quot;pieczara&quot; (meaning &quot;cavern&quot;), as caverns were supposedly created here as a result of exploitation of ore.

As a result of the 12th-century fragmentation of Poland it was part of various Piast-ruled duchies, the last being the Duchy of Opole until 1526. Between 1303 and 1318, the first church and independent parish were created there. In the 15th century, the zinc and lead mining industry developed and the process of settlement evolution begun.

===Modern era===
In 1526 Piekary came under the suzerainty of the Habsburg monarchy. In 1645, along with the Duchy of Opole, Piekary returned to Polish rule under the House of Vasa. Polish King John III Sobieski visited Piekary in 1683, while rushing to the relief of Vienna during the Ottoman invasion. The next years brought several peasant revolts against the German magnates. In 1697, newly elected King of Poland Augustus II the Strong stopped in Piekary before his royal coronation in Kraków. He converted to Catholicism in the local church and at the same time he sworn the pacta conventa. In January 1734, his son, elected king Augustus III of Poland, also stopped here, while heading for his royal coronation, and also swore the pacta conventa here.

In 1742 the settlement was annexed by Prussia and colonisation and Germanisation of Piekary Śląskie increased. The result was a strong movement towards maintaining the Polish origins of the land. In 1842, Piekary&#x27;s rector, priest Jan Alojzy Ficek, commissioned a new neo-romanesque Basilica of St. Mary and St. Bartholomew designed by Daniel Grötschel. A painting of the Virgin Mary was placed there. In the mid-19th century, founded a Polish printing house. In the late 19th century Polish singing and gymnastic societies, reading rooms and the first patriotic organizations were established. In 1905 the Polish Gymnastic Society &quot;Sokół&quot; was established in Piekary. Tram communication was available from 1894.

===Recent history===

It was one of the centers of Silesian Uprisings and in 1922 was ceded to the Second Polish Republic by Weimar Germany as 86% of the population voted for joining the re-established Polish state. In June 1922, a symbolic ceremony of reintegration of Piekary with Poland took place. Polish Uhlans under the command of Stanisław Szeptycki entered Piekary, greeted by the St. Mary church by the local populace led by , local Polish independence activist and poet, nicknamed the &quot;Silesian Wernyhora&quot;. On July 10, 1939, Piekary Śląskie received city rights with effect from 1940. As a result of the outbreak of World War II, the actual implementation of this law did not take place until 1947.

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Piekary was captured by Germany in September 1939, and then was under German occupation until 1945. Already in September 1939, the Germans carried out several executions of Poles (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). On September 6, Germans murdered three Poles in the present-day district of Brzozowice. On September 17, the &quot;Freikorps&quot; murdered two miners, one local official and one former Silesian Uprisings participant in Piekary. Several miners from the present-day district of Brzozowice were murdered in nearby Lasowice (present-day district of Tarnowskie Góry). Local teachers were among Polish teachers murdered in Nazi concentration camps. The &quot;Polenlager No. 188&quot;, a forced labour camp for Poles, was operated in the city. During the occupation, the city&#x27;s main street, Bytomska, was renamed Adolf Hitler Street (&quot;Adolf-Hitler-Straße&quot;).

In 1973 Kozłowa Góra was included within the city limits as the northernmost district. Under the administrative reform of 1975, the city limits were expanded by including the surrounding towns and settlements: Dąbrówka Wielka, Brzeziny Śląskie, Brzozowice and Kamień.

*Radlin II
*Stare Miasto (old city)

*Zawada

==History==
Being a borderland town, Wodzisław Śląski is a centre of the Wodzisław County, formed during a historical process lasting many centuries. Rich excavations the oldest finds dated back to the Stone Age give evidence about its ancient inhabitants.

===Middle Ages===

The city&#x27;s name derives from the Piast Duke Władysław of Opole. He located the city and established the Wodzisław monastery about 1257.

The city&#x27;s origins can be traced back into the 10th and 11th century, when three Slavic settlements existed on Wodzisław&#x27;s present-day territory which eventually merged to form one town. In the course of the medieval eastward migration of Flemish and German settlers (&quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;), Wodzisław, as many other Polish settlements, was incorporated (granted city status and right) according to the so-called Magdeburg Law at some point before 1257 (the exact date remains unknown). This, however, is not to be confused with a change in national affiliation; Wodzisław continued to be part of the Kingdom of Poland, until most of Silesia became a fiefdom of the Bohemian crown in 1327. At that times of Duchess Constance, the town developed fast. Wodzisław was one of the most populated and richest towns of Upper Silesia. In 14 and 15th century the city continued to grow and developed into a regional trade centre. In the 15th century, the Hussites devastated the city. From 1526, Bohemia, including the fiefdom of Silesia, which Wodzisław was a part of, came under the authority of the Habsburg crown.

===Early Modern Age===

After the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War Wodzisław was destroyed. Never back to Middle Ages&#x27; &quot;golden time&quot;. At the beginning of the War of the Austrian Succession between King Frederick II of Prussia (the Great) and the Habsburg empress Maria Theresa of Austria, the greatest part of Silesia, including Wodzisław, was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1740, which Austria eventually recognized in 1763. In 1815 the city became part of the Prussian Province of Silesia and was located in the Rybnik district. Coal mining gained importance for Wodzisław&#x27;s economy as early as the 19th century.

===20th century===
After the end of World War I in 1918, Polish statehood was restored. Amidst an atmosphere of ethnic unrest, a referendum was organized to determine the future national affiliation of Upper Silesia. In Wodzisław, out of 2,333 votes, 1,669 (72%) were in favour of Germany and 662 (28%) were in favour of Poland. However, the Rybnik district as a whole voted in favour of Poland with a 65% majority. The town and the largest part of the district were attached to the territory of the Second Polish Republic; Wodzisław thus became part of a Polish state for the first time since 1335 when Poland had ceded Silesia to Bohemia in the Treaty of Trentschin. The Upper Silesia plebiscite and eventual division of Upper Silesia were accompanied by three Silesian Uprisings of Polish militants. Within the Second Polish Republic of the interwar period, Wodzisław was part of the Silesian Voivodeship, which enjoyed far-reaching political and financial autonomy.

With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Wodzisław was invaded and then occupied by Germany, being in the part of Poland that was directly incorporated into the German state. The population was ethnically categorized and either &quot;re-Germanized&quot; or disfranchised and partially expelled into the General Government as Poles.

On 22 January 1945 a death march from Nazi German&#x27;s Auschwitz concentration camp, away, ended in Wodzisław Śląski, where the prisoners were put on freight trains to other camps. When the Soviet army advanced on Poland, nine days before the Soviets arrived, the Schutzstaffel had marched 60,000 prisoners out of the camp. Approximately 15,000 prisoners died on the way. There are memorials to the victims of the Holocaust from Wodzisław in Wodzisław and in the Baron Hirsch Cemetery Staten Island, New York where the Wodzisław landsmanshaft has a section.

On 26 March 1945 the Soviet army and 1st Czechoslovak Army Corps captured Wodzisław, which was then restored to Poland. Approximately 80% of the town was destroyed in World War II. The Old Town, including the Market Square, was fully restored after the war.

<text>Siemianowice Śląskie (; ; ) also known as Siemianowice is a city in Upper Silesia in southern Poland, near Katowice, in the core of the Metropolis GZM - a metropolis with a population of 2 million people and is located in the Silesian Highlands, on the Brynica river (tributary of the Vistula).

It is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously in Katowice Voivodeship, and before then in the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Siemianowice is one of the cities of the 2.7 million conurbation, the Katowice urban area, at the heart of the greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area populated by about 5,294,000 people. The population of the city is 65,684 (2021). Siemianowice Śląskie borders six cities: Piekary Śląskie, Chorzów, Czeladź, Będzin, Wojkowice, and the voivodeship capital Katowice.

==Etymology==
There are three hypothetical explanations for the origins of the name Siemianowice: either it comes from seven huts which were called Siedminowice/Siedmionowice in Old Polish; from the old legend about Siemion (Siemian), Michał and Maciej, or Siemion, Michał and Jakub; or it comes from &quot;ziemia nawa&quot; which means earth taken away from water.

==Administrative division==
* Centrum – 11,98 km2
* Michałkowice – 5,46 km2
* Bańgów – 2,96 km2
* Przełajka – 2,7 km2
* Bytków – 2,3 km2

==History==

Siemianowice dates back to medieval Piast-ruled Poland. It was probably first mentioned in documents in 1253.

In 1924, Siemianowice and Huta Laury communes were merged. The new city was named &quot;Siemianowice Śląskie&quot; and gained town privileges in 1932.

On 1 September 1939, the first day of the German invasion of Poland and World War II, there was a skirmish between German saboteurs and the Polish self-defense in the present-day district of Michałkowice. German saboteurs then entered the local mine, taking several dozen Polish miners as hostages. After a battle, Polish troops and volunteers, including members of the &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society and boy scouts, recaptured the mine. There were deaths on both sides, and the Poles also captured dozens of German saboteurs. The Germans eventually invaded and captured the city in the following days, and already on 8 September 1939 the German &quot;Freikorps&quot; murdered six Poles in the city. In September 1939, the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; operated in the city and committed various crimes against the Polish population. During the German occupation, two forced labour camps were established and operated in the city: one for Poles (&quot;Polenlager&quot;) and one for Jews. In April 1944, the Germans also established a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp, in which over 900 people were held and subjected to forced labour. In January 1945, the prisoners of the subcamp were taken to the Mauthausen concentration camp, and shortly afterwards the Germans left the city and the occupation ended.

In 1951, Michałkowice, Bytków, Bańgów and Przełajka were included within the city limits of Siemianowice as new districts.

<text>Mysłowice (; ) is a city in Silesia in Poland, bordering Katowice. The population of the city is 72,124.

It is located in the core of the Metropolis GZM in the Silesian Highlands, on the Przemsza and Brynica rivers (tributaries of the Vistula). It is situated in the Silesian Voivodeship since its formation in 1999, previously in the Katowice Voivodeship, and before then, the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship. Mysłowice is one of the cities comprising the 2.7 million conurbation – Katowice urban area and within the greater Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area with a population of about 5,294,000.

==History==

Mysłowice is one of the oldest cities in Upper Silesia. Located at the confluence of the White and Black Przemsza rivers, it is situated on an important trading route from Wrocław to Kraków. The earliest traces of the modern settlement date back to the 11th and 12th century, when it was part of Piast-ruled Poland. The first mention of a parish priest is found in a document from 1306. In 1360, Mysłowice was already referred to as a town. The previously existing village was granted city rights around 1260.

Over the centuries the ownership of the city changed frequently, as did the borders between different countries. After the foundation of the German Empire in 1871 the area became known as &quot;Dreikaisereck&quot; (&quot;triangle of the three emperors&quot;), as it was situated at the point where the Austrian, German and Russian Empires adjoined. After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence, and in 1919, local Polish miners organized large protests in Mysłowice. On August 15, 1919, the German &quot;Grenzschutz&quot; opened fire on protesting Polish miners and their families. Seven miners, two women and a teenage boy were killed, and many people were wounded. The event, known as the &quot;Mysłowice massacre&quot;, sparked the First Silesian Uprising against Germany. In 1921, the Upper Silesia plebiscite was held, in which 56% of the residents of Myslowitz voted to remain in Germany and 44% voted to rejoin Poland, while the overwhelming majority in the present-day districts (then surrounding villages) of Brzezinka, Brzęczkowice, Dziećkowice, Kosztowy, Krasowy and Wesoła opted to reintegrate with Poland, with the result ranging from 77.3% voting for Poland in Brzęczkowice to 96.7% in Wesoła. After the Silesian Uprisings in 1922, Mysłowice and the rest of East Upper Silesia became part of the newly restored Second Polish Republic.

During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), the Germans operated a Nazi prison in the town. Many Polish children passed through the prison during the implementation of the Nazi genocidal policy towards Polish families in Silesia. In the Wesoła district, the Germans also established and operated a forced labour camp for Jews and a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp. In the final stages of the war, most prisoners of the subcamp were evacuated by the Germans in a death march to Gliwice and then deported to Germany, while the remaining sick prisoners were mostly murdered by the SS. A dozen or so prisoners managed to hide and survived the massacre, and were taken care of by Polish miners afterwards.

In 1951, city limits were expanded, and Brzezinka and Brzęczkowice were included as new districts.

==Districts==
Mysłowice is subdivided into 14 districts:

*Bończyk–Tuwima
*Brzezinka
*Brzęczkowice and Słupna
*Dziećkowice

==Education==
Mysłowice is home to a university-level institution called Górnośląska Wyższa Szkoła Pedagogiczna im. Kard. Augusta Hlonda (August Hlond College of Pedagogy) located at ul. Piastów Śląskich 10.

Mysłowice has eight Junior High Schools and five Secondary and vocational schools. There are at least 20 kindergartens located in Mysłowice, residing at location with greater density of children. On top of that, there are also 17 primary schools operating in the city.

==Monuments==
There are some buildings in Mysłowice which prove the medieval origin of the town. Farna Church, located near the market square, is the oldest and probably the only brick church in Mysłowice.
Saint Cross Church is another brick building, maintained in baroque and classicistic style; according to Catholic tradition, it is the oldest place of religious worship in the town. 
There is also a Jewish cemetery in the town. The origins of the place trace back to the 18th century, when Jews decided to buy a tract in order to create their own graveyard.

==Culture==

The Off Festival is an annual music festival started in 2006 by musician Artur Rojek (however, in 2010 it was moved to Katowice). Bands from Mysłowice include Myslovitz formed 1992 (named after their hometown), as well as Lenny Valentino (1998–2001).

==Economy==
As of 2017, the city was the location of one of five Amazon logistics centres in Poland, which serves customers across Europe.

<text>Fordism is an industrial engineering and manufacturing system that serves as the basis of modern social and labor-economic systems that support industrialized, standardized mass production and mass consumption. The concept is named after Henry Ford. It is used in social, economic, and management theory about production, working conditions, consumption, and related phenomena, especially regarding the 20th century. It describes an ideology of advanced capitalism centered around the American socioeconomic systems in place in the post-war economic boom.

==Overview==

Fordism is &quot;the eponymous manufacturing system designed to produce standardized, low-cost goods and afford its workers decent enough wages to buy them.&quot; It has also been described as &quot;a model of economic expansion and technological progress based on mass production: the manufacture of standardized products in huge volumes using special purpose machinery and unskilled labor.&quot; Although Fordism was a method used to improve productivity in the automotive industry, the principle could be applied to any kind of manufacturing process. Major success stemmed from three major principles:

# The standardization of the product (nothing is handmade, but everything is made through machines and molds by unskilled workers)
# The employment of assembly lines, which use special-purpose tools and/or equipment to allow common-skilled workers to contribute to the finished product
# Workers are paid higher &quot;living&quot; wages so that they can afford to purchase the products they make

The principles, coupled with a technological revolution during Henry Ford&#x27;s time, allowed for his revolutionary form of labor to flourish. His assembly line was revolutionary though not original as it had previously been used at slaughterhouses. His most original contribution to the modern world was breaking down complex tasks into simpler ones, with the help of specialised tools. Simpler tasks created interchangeable parts that could be used the same way every time. That allowed for a very adaptable flexibility, creating an assembly line that could change its constituent components to meet the needs of the product being assembled. In reality, the assembly line had existed before Ford, although not in quite the same effectiveness as he would create. His real accomplishment was recognizing the potential by breaking it all down into its components, only to build it back up again in a more effective and productive combination, thereby producing an optimum method for the real world.

The major advantages of such a change was that it cut down on the manpower necessary for the factory to operate, and it deskilled the labour itself, cutting down on costs of production. 

There are four levels of Fordism, as described by Bob Jessop.

# Capitalist labour process&quot;:&quot; Through implementing highly organized, Taylorist methods of production, designed to produce higher output, output can be increased and workers fully utilized.
# Accumulation regime: Under the adherence to a belief in a &quot;&#x27;virtuous circle of growth&quot;,&#x27; by increasing productivity, wages rise resulting in higher productivity, demand, investment, and operational efficacy. 
# Social mode of economic regulation: Clarity is gained by analyzing the in/outflow of capital, both in micro- [wages, internal movement] and macro- [monetary body, commerciality, external relations]. 
# Generic mode of &#x27;societalization&#x27;: Deciphering State&#x27;s and company&#x27;s roles in the day-to-day economic lifestyles and patterns of the workforce, their economic habits, and the regional impact.

==Background==
The Ford Motor Company was one of several hundred small automobile manufacturers that emerged between 1890 and 1910. After five years of producing automobiles, Ford introduced the Model T, which was simple and light but sturdy enough to drive on the country&#x27;s primitive roads. The mass production of this automobile lowered its unit price, making it affordable for the average consumer. Furthermore, Ford substantially increased his workers&#x27; wages to combat rampant absenteeism and employee turnover, which approached 400% annually, which had the byproduct of giving them the means to become customers. That led to massive consumption. In fact, the Model T surpassed all expectations because it attained a peak of 60% of the automobile output within the United States.

The production system that Ford exemplified involved synchronization, precision, and specialization within a company.

Ford and his senior managers did not use the word &quot;Fordism&quot; themselves to describe their motivations or worldview, which they did not consider an &quot;&quot;. However, many contemporaries framed their worldview as one and applied the name Fordism to it.

==History==
The term gained prominence when it was used by Antonio Gramsci in 1934 in his essay &quot;Americanism and Fordism&quot; in his &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot;. Since then, it has been used by a number of writers on economics and society, mainly but not exclusively in the Marxist tradition.

According to historian Charles S. Maier, Fordism proper was preceded in Europe by Taylorism, a technique of labor discipline and workplace organization, based upon supposedly scientific studies of human efficiency and incentive systems. It attracted European intellectuals, especially in Germany and Italy, from the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; to World War I.

After 1918, however, the goal of Taylorist labor efficiency thought in Europe moved to &quot;Fordism&quot;, the reorganization of the entire productive process by the moving assembly line, standardization, and the mass market. The grand appeal of Fordism in Europe was that it promised to sweep away all the archaic residues of precapitalist society, by subordinating the economy, society, and even the human personality to the strict criteria of technical rationality. The Great Depression blurred the utopian vision of American technocracy, but World War II and its aftermath revived the ideal.

Later, under the inspiration of Gramsci, Marxists picked up the Fordism concept in the 1930s and developed Post-Fordism in the 1970s. Robert J. Antonio and Alessandro Bonanno (2000) trace the development of Fordism and subsequent economic stages, from globalization to neoliberal globalization, during the 20th century, and emphasized the United States role in globalization. &quot;Fordism,&quot; for Gramsci, meant routine, intensified labor to promote production. Antonio and Bonanno argue that Fordism peaked in the post-World War II decades of American dominance and mass consumerism but collapsed from political and cultural attacks on the people in the 1970s.

Advances in technology and the end of the Cold War ushered in a new &quot;neoliberal&quot; phase of globalization in the 1990s. Antonio and Bonanno further suggest that negative elements of Fordism, such as economic inequality, remained, allowing related cultural and environmental troubles, which inhibited America&#x27;s pursuit of democracy to surface.

Historian Thomas Hughes has detailed how the Soviet Union, in the 1920s and the 1930s, enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism by importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the Five-Year Plan and the centrally-planned economy can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. Hughes quotes Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Foundations of Leninism:

Hughes describes how, as the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both the Soviets and the Americans chose to ignore or deny the contribution of American ideas and expertise. The Soviets did so because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to their rivals, while the Americans did so because they did not wish to acknowledge, during the Cold War, their part in creating a powerful rival.

==Post-Fordism==
The period after Fordism has been termed Post-Fordist and Neo-Fordist. The former implies that global capitalism has made a clean break from Fordism, including overcoming its inconsistencies, but the latter implies that elements of the Fordist ROA continued to exist. The Regulation School preferred the term After-Fordism (or the French &quot;Après-Fordisme&quot;) to denote that what comes after Fordism was or is not clear.

In Post-Fordist economies:
* New information technologies are important.
* Products are marketed to niche markets rather than in mass consumption patterns based on social class.
* Service industries predominate over manufacturing.
* The workforce is feminized.
* Financial markets are globalized.
*White collar creativity is needed.
*Workers do not stay in one job for their whole lives.
*&#x27;Just-in-time&#x27; systems in which products are manufactured after orders are placed.

==Cultural references==
The mass-produced robots in Karel Čapek&#x27;s play &quot;R.U.R.&quot; have been described as representing &quot;the traumatic transformation of modern society by the First World War and the Fordist assembly line.&quot;

A religion based on the worship of Henry Ford is a central feature of the technocracy in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot;, where the principles of mass production are applied to the generation of people as well as to industry.
