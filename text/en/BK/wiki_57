<text>Syama Prasad Mookerjee (6 July 1901 – 23 June 1953) was an Indian barrister, educationist, politician, activist, social worker, and a minister in the state and national governments. Noted for his opposition to Quit India movement within the independence movement in India, he later served as India&#x27;s first Minister for Industry and Supply (currently known as Minister of Commerce and Industries) in Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s cabinet after breaking up with the Hindu Mahasabha. After falling out with Nehru, protesting against the Liaquat–Nehru Pact, Mukherjee resigned from Nehru&#x27;s cabinet. With the help of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, he founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the predecessor to the Bharatiya Janata Party, in 1951.

He was also the president of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha from 1943 to 1946. He was arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in 1953 when he tried to cross the border of the state. He was provisionally diagnosed of a heart attack and shifted to a hospital but died a day later. Since the Bharatiya Janata Party is the successor to the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, Mookerjee is also regarded as the founder of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) by its members.

==Early life and academic career==
Syama Mukherjee was born during the British Raj on 6 July 1901 in Calcutta, now located in the West Bengal state of India. His grandfather Ganga Prasad Mukherjee was born in Jirat and was the first in the family who migrated to and settled in Calcutta.

Syama Prasad&#x27;s father was Ashutosh Mukherjee, a judge of the High Court of Calcutta, Bengal Presidency, and was also the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. His mother was Jogamaya Devi Mukherjee. was a very meritorious student and he came to Calcutta to study in Medical College with the help of the wealthy people of Jirat. Later he settled down in the Bhawanipore area of Calcutta.

Syama Prasad enrolled in Bhawanipur&#x27;s Mitra Institution in 1906 and his behaviour in school was later described favourably by his teachers. In 1914, he passed his matriculation examination and was admitted into Presidency College. He stood seventeenth in the Inter Arts Examination in 1916 and graduated in English, securing the first position in first class in 1921. He was married to Sudha Devi on 16 April 1922. Mukherjee also completed an MA in Bengali, being graded as first class in 1923 and also became a fellow of the Senate of the University of Calcutta in 1923. He completed his LLB in 1924.

He enrolled as an advocate in Calcutta High Court in 1924, the same year in which his father had died. Subsequently, he left for England in 1926 to study at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn and was called to the English Bar in the same year. In 1934, at the age of 33, he became the youngest Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta; he held the office until 1938. During his term as Vice-Chancellor, Rabindranath Tagore delivered the University Convocation Address in Bengali for the first time, and the Indian vernacular was introduced as a subject for the highest examination. On 10 September 1938, the Senate of Calcutta university resolved to confer honorary D.Litt. on the Ex-Vice Chancellor in its opinion &quot;by reason of eminent position and attainments, a fit and proper person to receive such a degree.&quot; Mukherjee received the D.Litt from Calcutta University on 26 November 1938. He was also the 15th President of the Association of Indian Universities during 1941-42.

==Political career before independence==
He started his political career in 1929, when he entered the Bengal Legislative Council as an Indian National Congress (INC) candidate representing Calcutta University. However, he resigned the next year when the INC decided to boycott the legislature. Subsequently, he contested the election as an independent candidate and was elected in the same year. In 1937, he was elected as an independent candidate in the elections which brought the Krishak Praja Party to power.

He served as the Finance Minister of Bengal Province in 1941–42 under A.K. Fazlul Haq&#x27;s Progressive Coalition government which was formed on 12 December 1941 after the resignations of the Congress government. During his tenure, his statements against the government were censored and his movements were restricted. He was also prevented from visiting the Midnapore district in 1942 when severe floods caused a heavy loss of life and property. He resigned on 20 November 1942 accusing the British government of trying to hold on to India under any cost and criticised its repressive policies against the Quit India Movement. After resigning, he mobilised support and organised relief with the help of Mahabodhi Society, Ramakrishna Mission and Marwari Relief Society. In 1946, he was again elected as an independent candidate from the Calcutta University. He was elected as a member of the Constituent Assembly of India in the same year.

===Hindu Mahasabha and Bengali Hindu Homeland Movement===
Mukherjee joined the Hindu Mahasabha in Bengal in 1939 and became its acting president that same year. He was appointed as the working president of the organisation in 1940. In February 1941, Mukherjee told a Hindu rally that if Muslims wanted to live in Pakistan they should &quot;pack their bag and baggage and leave India ... [to] wherever they like&quot;. Yet, the Hindu Mahasabha also formed provincial coalition governments with the All-India Muslim League in Sindh and the North-West Frontier Province while Mukherjee was its leader. He was elected as the President of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha in 1943. He remained in this position till 1946, with Laxman Bhopatkar becoming the new president in the same year.

Mukherjee demanded the partition of Bengal in 1946 to prevent the inclusion of its Hindu-majority areas in a Muslim-dominated East Pakistan. A meeting held by the Mahasabha on 15 April 1947 in Tarakeswar authorised him to take steps for ensuring partition of Bengal. In May 1947, he wrote a letter to Lord Mountbatten telling him that Bengal must be partitioned even if India was not. He also opposed a failed bid for a united but independent Bengal made in 1947 by Sarat Bose, the brother of Subhas Chandra Bose, and Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, a Bengali Muslim politician. His views were strongly affected by the Noakhali genocide in East Bengal, where mobs belonging to the Muslim League massacred Hindus.
It was Mukherjee who launched the Bengali Hindu Homeland Movement. It refers to the movement of the Bengali Hindu people for the Partition of Bengal in 1947 to create a homeland aka West Bengal for themselves within the Indian Union, in the wake of Muslim League&#x27;s proposal and campaign to include the entire province of Bengal within Pakistan, which was to be a homeland for the Muslims of British India.

===Opposition to Quit India Movement===
Following the Hindu Mahasabha&#x27;s official decision to boycott the Quit India movement and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&#x27;s decision of non-participation in the movement.

Mukherjee wrote a letter to Sir John Herbert, Governor of Bengal as to how they should respond to &quot;Quit India&quot; movement. In this letter, dated 26 July 1942 he wrote:

Let me now refer to the situation that may be created in the province as a result of any widespread movement launched by the Congress. Anybody, who during the war, plans to stir up mass feeling, resulting internal disturbances or insecurity, must be resisted by any Government that may function for the time being

Mukherjee in this letter reiterated that the Fazlul Haq-led Bengal Government, along with its alliance partner Hindu Mahasabha would make every possible effort to defeat the Quit India Movement in the province of Bengal and made a concrete proposal in regard to this:

The question is how to combat this movement (Quit India) in Bengal? The administration of the province should be carried on in such a manner that in spite of the best efforts of the Congress, this movement will fail to take root in the province. It should be possible for us, especially responsible Ministers, to be able to tell the public that the freedom for which the Congress has started the movement, already belongs to the representatives of the people. In some spheres, it might be limited during the emergency. Indians have to trust the British, not for the sake for Britain, not for any advantage that the British might gain, but for the maintenance of the defense and freedom of the province itself. You, as Governor, will function as the constitutional head of the province and will be guided entirely on the advice of your Minister.

The Indian historian R.C. Majumdar noted this fact and states:

Shyam Prasad ended the letter with a discussion of the mass movement organised by Congress. He expressed the apprehension that the movement would create internal disorder and will endanger internal security during the war by exciting popular feeling and he opined that any government in power has to suppress it, but that according to him could not be done only by persecution... In that letter he mentioned item-wise the steps to be taken for dealing with the situation...

During Mukherjee&#x27;s resignation speech, however, he characterised the policies of the British government towards the movement as &quot;repressive&quot;.

==Political career after independence==
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru inducted Mukherjee into the Interim Central Government as a Minister for Industry and Supply on 15 August 1947.

Mukherjee condemned the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi as the &quot;most stunning blow that could fall on India. That he who had made India free and self-reliant, a friend of all and enemy of none, loved and respected by millions, should fall at the hands of an assassin, one of his own community and countrymen, is a matter of the deepest shame and tragedy.&quot; He began to have differences with Hindu Mahasabha after Gandhi&#x27;s killing, in which the Mahasabha was blamed by Vallabhbhai Patel for creating the atmosphere that led to the killing. Mukherjee suggested the organisation suspend its political activities. Shortly after it did, in December 1948, he left. One of his reasons was the rejection of his proposal to allow non-Hindus to become members. Mukherjee resigned along with K.C. Neogy from the Cabinet on 8 April 1950 over a disagreement about the 1950 Delhi Pact with Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan.

Mukherjee was firmly against their joint pact to establish minority commissions and guarantee minority rights in both countries as he thought it left Hindus in East Bengal to the mercy of Pakistan. While addressing a rally in Calcutta on 21 May, he stated that an exchange of population and property at governmental level on regional basis between East Bengal and the states of Tripura, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar was the only option in the current situation.

Mukherjee founded the Bharatiya Jana Sangh on 21 October 1951 in Delhi, becoming its first president. In the 1952 elections, the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) won three seats in the Parliament of India, including Mukherjee&#x27;s. He had formed the National Democratic Party within the Parliament. It consisted of 32 members of the Lok Sabha and 10 members of the Rajya Sabha; however, it was not recognised by the speaker as an opposition party. The BJS was created with the objective of nation-building and nationalising all non-Hindus by &quot;inculcating Indian Culture&quot; in them. The party was ideologically close to the RSS and widely considered the proponent of Hindu nationalism.

==Opinion on special status of Jammu and Kashmir==
After having supported the Article 370 during the parliamentary discussions over the legislation, Mukherjee became opposed to the legislation after falling out with Nehru. He fought against it inside and outside the parliament with one of the goals of Bharatiya Jana Sangh being its abrogation. He raised his voice against the provision in his Lok Sabha speech on 26 June 1952. He termed the arrangements under the article as Balkanization of India and the three-nation theory of Sheikh Abdullah. The state was granted its own flag along with a prime minister whose permission was required for anyone to enter the state. In opposition to this, Mukherjee once said &quot;Ek desh mein do Vidhan, do Pradhan aur Do Nishan nahi chalenge&quot; (A single country can&#x27;t have two constitutions, two prime ministers, and two national emblems). Bharatiya Jana Sangh along with Hindu Mahasabha and Jammu Praja Parishad launched a massive Satyagraha to get the provisions removed. In his letter to Nehru dated 3 February 1953, he wrote that the issue of accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India should not be delayed, to which Nehru responded by referring to international complications the issue could create.

Mukherjee went to visit Kashmir in 1953 and observed a hunger strike to protest the law that prohibited Indian citizens from settling within the state and mandating that they carry ID cards. Mukherjee wanted to go to Jammu and Kashmir but, because of the prevailing permit system, he was not given permission. He was arrested on 11 May at Lakhanpur while crossing the border into Kashmir illegally. Although the ID card rule was revoked owing to his efforts, he died as a detainee on 23 June 1953.

On 5 August 2019, when Government of India proposed constitutional Amendment to repeal Article 370, many BJP members described the event as realisation of Syama Prasad Mukherjee&#x27;s dream.

==Personal life==
Syama Prasad had three brothers who were; Rama Prasad who was born in 1896, Uma Prasad who was born in 1902 and Bama Prasad Mukherjee who was born in 1906. Rama Prasad became a judge in High Court of Calcutta, while Uma became famed as a trekker and a travel writer. He also had three sisters who were; Kamala who was born in 1895, Amala who was born in 1905 and Ramala in 1908. He was married in 1922 to Sudha Devi for 11 years and had five children – the last one, a four-month-old son, died from diphtheria. His wife died of double pneumonia shortly afterwards in 1933 or 1934. Syama Prasad refused to remarry after her death. He had two sons, Anutosh and Debatosh, and two daughters, Sabita and Arati. His grandniece Kamala Sinha served as the Minister of State for External affairs in the I. K. Gujral ministry.

Syama Prasad was also affiliated with the Buddhist Mahabodhi Society. In 1942, he succeeded M.N. Mukherjee to become the president of the organisation. The relics of Gautam Buddha&#x27;s two disciples Sariputra and Maudgalyayana, discovered in the Great Stupa at Sanchi by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1851 and kept at the British Museum, were brought back to India by HMIS Tir. A ceremony attended by politicians and leaders of many foreign countries was held on the next day at Calcutta Maidan. They were handed over by Nehru to Mukherjee, who later took these relics to Cambodia, Burma, Thailand and Vietnam. Upon his return to India, he placed the relics inside the Sanchi Stupa in November 1952.

==Death==
Mukherjee was arrested upon entering Kashmir on 11 May 1953. He and two of his arrested companions were first taken to Central Jail of Srinagar. Later they were transferred to a cottage outside the city. Mukherjee&#x27;s condition started deteriorating and he started feeling pain in the back and high temperature on the night between 19 and 20 June. He was diagnosed with dry pleurisy from which he had also suffered in 1937 and 1944. The doctor prescribed him a streptomycin injection and powders, however, Mukherjee informed him that his family physician had told him that streptomycin did not suit his system. The doctor, however, told him that new information about the drug had come to light and assured him that he would be fine. On 22 June, he felt pain in the heart region, started perspiring and started feeling like he was fainting. He was later shifted to a hospital and provisionally diagnosed with a heart attack. He died a day later. The state government declared that he had died on 23 June at 3:40 a.m. due to a heart attack.

His death in custody raised wide suspicion across the country and demands for an independent inquiry were raised, including earnest requests from his mother, Jogamaya Devi, to Nehru. The prime minister declared that he had asked a number of persons who were privy to the facts and, according to him, there was no mystery behind Mukherjee&#x27;s death. Devi did not accept Nehru&#x27;s reply and requested an impartial inquiry. Nehru, however, ignored the letter and no inquiry commission was set up.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee claimed in 2004 that the arrest of Mukherjee in Jammu and Kashmir was a &quot;Nehru conspiracy&quot; and that the death of Mukherjee has remained &quot;even now a mystery&quot;. The BJP in 2011 called for an inquiry to probe Mukherjee&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
One of main thoroughfare in Calcutta was renamed Syama Prasad Mukherjee Road on 3 July 1953 a few days after his death. Syamaprasad College founded by him in 1945 in Kolkata is named after him. Shyama Prasad Mukherji College of University of Delhi was established in 1969 in his memory. On 7 August 1998, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation named a bridge after Mukherjee. Delhi has a major road named after Mukherjee called Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Marg. Kolkata, too, has a major road called Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Road. In 2001, the main research funding institute of the Government of India, CSIR, instituted a new fellowship named after him.

On 22 April 2010, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi&#x27;s (MCD) newly constructed Rs. 650-crore building, the tallest building in Delhi, was named the Doctor Syama Prasad Mukherjee Civic Centre. It was inaugurated by Home Minister P. Chidambaram. The building, which is estimated to cater to 20,000 visitors per day, will also house different wings and offices of the MCD. The MCD also built the Syama Prasad Swimming Pool Complex which hosted aquatic events during the 2010 Commonwealth Games held at New Delhi.

In 2012, a flyover at Mathikere in Bangalore City Limits was inaugurated and named the Dr Syama Prasad Mukherjee Flyover. The International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur is named after him.

In April 2017, Ranchi College was upgraded to Shyama Prasad Mukherjee University. In September 2017, Kolar, a town in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, was renamed as Shyama Prasad Mukherji Nagar by the state&#x27;s Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan.

<text>&quot;Hey Diddle Diddle&quot; (also &quot;Hi Diddle Diddle&quot;, &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot;, or &quot;The Cow Jumped Over the Moon&quot;) is an English nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19478.

==Lyrics and music==
A version of the rhyme is:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;
Hey diddle diddle,
The cat and the fiddle,
The cow jumped over the moon;
The little dog laughed
To see such sport,
And the dish ran away with the spoon.&lt;/poem&gt;

The rhyme is the source of the English expression &quot;over the moon&quot;, meaning &quot;delighted, thrilled, extremely happy&quot;.

&lt;/score&gt;
The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by the composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his &quot;National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs&quot; (1870). The word &quot;sport&quot; in the rhyme is sometimes replaced with &quot;fun&quot;, &quot;a sight&quot;, or &quot;craft&quot;.

==Origins==

The rhyme may date back to at least the sixteenth century. Some references suggest it dates back in some form a thousand or more years: in early medieval illuminated manuscripts a cat playing a fiddle was a popular image. There is a reference in Thomas Preston&#x27;s play &quot;A lamentable tragedy mixed ful of pleasant mirth, conteyning the life of Cambises King of Percia&quot;, printed in 1569 that may refer to the rhyme:

&lt;poem&gt;They be at hand Sir with stick and fiddle;
They can play a new dance called hey-diddle-diddle.&lt;/poem&gt;

Another possible reference is in Alexander Montgomerie&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry and the Slae&quot; from 1597:

&lt;poem&gt;But since you think&#x27;t an easy thing
To mount above the moon,
Of your own fiddle take a spring
And dance when you have done.&lt;/poem&gt;

The name &quot;Cat and the Fiddle&quot; was a common name for inns, including one known to have been at Old Chaunge, London by 1587.

The earliest recorded version of the poem resembling the modern form was printed around 1765 in London in &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot; with the lyrics:
&lt;poem&gt;Hey diddle diddle,
The Cat and the Fiddle,
The Cow jump&#x27;d over the Moon,
The little dog laugh&#x27;d to see such Craft,
And the Fork ran away with the Spoon.&lt;/poem&gt;

==In fiction==
In L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Mother Goose in Prose&quot;, the rhyme was written by a farm boy named Bobby who had just seen the cat running around with his fiddle clung to her tail, the cow jumping over the moon&#x27;s reflection in the waters of a brook, the dog running around and barking with excitement, and the dish and the spoon from his supper sliding into the brook.

In P. L. Travers&#x27;s first &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; book, the titular character tells the children more about a cow they notice in the street, namely that she once jumped over the Moon to cure her dancing affliction, as advised by a king, who references an already-existing story of &quot;the Cow Who Jumped Over the Moon&quot;.

In J. R. R. Tolkien’s &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, the rhyme is said to be a remnant of a much longer narrative poem written by the character Bilbo Baggins.

==Meaning==
The numerous theories seeking to explain the rhyme have been largely discredited. James Orchard Halliwell&#x27;s suggestion that it was a corruption of an ancient Greek chorus was probably passed to him as a hoax by George Burges.

Another theory is that it comes from a low Dutch anti-clerical rhyme about priests demanding hard work. Other alleged bases for the rhyme include the Egyptian goddess Hathor, the Hebrew Flight from Egypt, or even the relationships of Elizabeth, Lady Katherine Grey, with the Earls of Hertford and Leicester. The “cat and the fiddle” has also been tied to Catherine of Aragon, Catherine I of Russia, Canton de Fidèle, an alleged governor of Calais, and the game of cat (trap-ball). An apparently modern theory is that it may refer to the constellations of Leo the cat, Lyra the fiddle, Taurus the cow, Canis Minor the little dog, and Ursa Major and Ursa Minor the Big and Little Dippers, which align with the Moon around the winter solstice.

The profusion of unsupported explanations was satirised by J. R. R. Tolkien in his fictional explanations of the poem &quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late&quot; referenced above. Although there is some support for the trap-ball theory, scholarly commentators mostly conclude the rhyme is simply meant to be nonsense verse, a type of literary nonsense.

<doc id="384371" wikidata="Q17125448" url="?curid=384371" title="Pussy Cat Pussy Cat">
<text>&quot;Pussy Cat, Pussy Cat&quot; or &quot;Pussycat, Pussycat&quot; is a popular English language nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 15094.

==Lyrics and melody==
Common modern versions include:
:Pussy cat, pussy cat, where have you been?
:I&#x27;ve been to London to visit/look at/see the Queen.
:Pussy cat, pussy cat, what did you do there?
:I frightened a little mouse under her/the chair.

The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first noted by the composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his &quot;National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs&quot; (1870). For the original version, there is no &#x27;do&#x27; in &#x27;what did you there&#x27;.

==Origins==
The earliest record of the rhyme is publication in &quot;Songs for the Nursery&quot;, printed in London in 1805. The Queen most often depicted in illustrations is Elizabeth I, but Caroline of Brunswick has also been suggested.

<text>&quot;Little Boy Blue&quot; is an English-language nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 11318.

==Lyrics==
A common version of the rhyme is:

&lt;poem&gt;
Little Boy Blue,
Come blow your horn.
The sheep&#x27;s in the meadow, 
The cow&#x27;s in the corn.
Where is the boy
Who looks after the sheep?
He&#x27;s under the haystack,
Fast asleep.
Will you wake him?
No, not I,
For if I do,
He&#x27;s sure to cry.&lt;/poem&gt;

==Origins and meaning==
The earliest printed version of the rhyme is in &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Little Song Book&quot; (c. 1744), but the rhyme may be much older. It may be alluded to in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; (III, vi) when Edgar, masquerading as Mad Tom, says:

&lt;poem&gt;Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepheard?
:Thy sheepe be in the corne;
And for one blast of thy minikin mouth
:Thy sheepe shall take no harme.&lt;/poem&gt;

It has been argued that Little Boy Blue was intended to represent Cardinal Wolsey, who was the son of an Ipswich butcher, who may have acted as a hayward to his father&#x27;s livestock, but there is no corroborative evidence to support this assertion. A more plausible, simpler suggestion, avoiding any reference to Wolsey, is made by George Homans in his book &quot;English Villagers of the 13th Century&quot;, who writes, after quoting &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;″s description of the hayward and his horn: &quot;The hayward&#x27;s horn, his badge of office, must have been used to give warning that cattle or other trespassers were in the corn. Little Boy Blue was a hayward.&quot;

<text>Serb enclaves are settlements in Kosovo outside North Kosovo (&quot;south of the Ibar&quot;) where Serbs form a majority.

Serbs have often built roadblocks and barricades, to prevent access by Kosovo Police and customs officers. After the initial outflow after the Kosovo War the situation of the Kosovo Serb communities has improved. The 2013 Brussels Agreement allowed full operation of Kosovo Police and customs officials, while the Community of Serb Municipalities is planned to be created within the Republic of Kosovo legal framework.

==History==
According to the 1991 census in Yugoslavia, there were five municipalities with a Serb majority in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. Those were: Leposavić, Zvečan, Zubin Potok, Štrpce and Novo Brdo. The remaining municipalities had an Albanian majority, while other significant ethnic minorities (such as ethnic Muslims and Romani) did not form majorities in any of the municipalities.

Prior to the 1999 Kosovo War, there were many more Serbs living in the territory of Kosovo. Many of them left in 1999, and some more left during the 2004 unrest, when the Serb community and Serbian cultural heritage were targeted, and as a result 35 churches, including 18 monuments of culture, were demolished, burnt or severely damaged. Estimates of the number of Serbs thus displaced range from 65,000 to 250,000 Only about 3.000 of them have returned since. Based on Serbian former Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija, 312 of 437 towns and villages in which Serbs lived were completely ethnically cleansed, and in the ensuing violence, more than 1.000 Serbs were killed, while 841 were kidnapped and 960 wounded.

Between 2000 and 2008, the UNMIK administration created eight new municipalities on the territory of Kosovo, three of which have an ethnic Serb majority: Gračanica, Klokot-Vrbovac and Ranilug. In 2008, the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija was created to coordinate the efforts of the Serbian minority in Kosovo. There are some 120,000 Serbs in Kosovo, of whom about a third are in the north. They believe that if Republic of Kosovo government officials are deployed on the border, Kosovo will eventually take control of the north, which is now a de facto part of Serbia. Kosovo&#x27;s Serbs, especially in the north, reject its independence.

During the ethnic tensions in the 2004 unrest in Kosovo, numerous Serb enclaves were assaulted by Kosovo Albanian rioters.

==Demographics==
===Municipalities===
According to the 2011 census, which was boycotted in North Kosovo and partially boycotted by Serbs in southern Kosovo, the municipalities of Gračanica, Parteš and Ranilug (enclaves, outside North Kosovo) have a Serb majority, while Serbs form about 45% of the total population of Novo Brdo, Štrpce and Klokot.

===Towns and villages===

From 2009 to 2010, 5 new municipalities were formed of settlements with Serbian ethnic majority, in order to establish Community of Serb Municipalities in Kosovo. These municipalities are: Gračanica/Graçanicë, Klokot/Kllokot, Ranilug/Ranillugë, Parteš/Parteshi and Novo Brdo/Artana.

Serbian settlements in other municipalities (as of the 2011 Kosovo Census):
*Vushtrri/Vučitrn municipality: no Serb majority settlements anymore. In Prilužje and Grace Serbians still form a significant minority.
*City of Pristina: Gračanica/Graçanicë has a Serb majority.
*Lipjan/Lipljan municipality: no Serb majority settlements anymore. Dobrotin, Livađe, Donja Gušterica, Gornja Gušterica, Suvi Do became part of Gračanica/Graçanicë municipalility.
*Fushë Kosova/Kosovo Polje municipality: no Serb majority settlements anymore. Batuse became part of Gračanica/Graçanicë municipalility.
*Gjilan/Gnjilane municipality: no Serb majority settlements anymore. Pasjane and Donja Budriga became part of the Parteš/Parteshi municipality, while Koretište, Gornje Kusce, Straža, Gornji Makreš became part of the Novo Brdo/Artana municipality, in Šilovo Serbians still form a significant minority.
*Peja/Peć municipality: Goraždevac; 
*Burim/Istok municipality: Osojane
*Rahovec municipality: officially no Serb majority settlements anymore, however Hoçë e Madhe/Velika Hoča is estimated to have a Serb majority.

<doc id="384375" wikidata="Q9935" url="?curid=384375" title="Fanta">
<text>Fanta () is an American-owned brand of fruit-flavored carbonated soft drinks created by Coca-Cola Deutschland under the leadership of German businessman Max Keith. There are over 200 flavors worldwide. Fanta originated in Germany as a Coca-Cola alternative in 1941 due to the American trade embargo of Nazi Germany which affected the availability of Coca-Cola ingredients. Fanta soon dominated the German market with three million cases sold in 1943. The current formulation of Fanta, with orange flavor, was developed in Italy in 1955.

==History==
===Wartime product===
During the Second World War, Germany was under a United States trade embargo, the British naval blockade and the import of Coca-Cola syrup was prohibited.
To circumvent this, Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola Deutschland (Coca-Cola GmbH), decided to create a new product for the German market, using only ingredients available in Germany at the time, including sugar beet, whey (a cheese byproduct), and apple pomace. He later described them as the &quot;leftovers of leftovers&quot;. The name was the result of a brainstorming session, which started with Keith&#x27;s exhorting his team to &quot;use their imagination&quot; (&quot;Fantasie&quot; in German), to which one of his salesmen, Joe Knipp, retorted &quot;Fanta!&quot;.

The German plant had been cut off from Coca-Cola headquarters following America&#x27;s entry into the war after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. After the war, the Coca-Cola Company regained control of the plant, formula, and the trademarks to the new Fanta product—as well as the plant profits made during the war.

In 1943, 3 million cases of Fanta were sold in Germany. Many bottles were not consumed as a beverage but used as a cooking ingredient to add sweetness and flavor to soups and stews, as sugar was severely rationed.

During the war, the Dutch Coca-Cola plant in Amsterdam (N.V. Nederlandse Coca-Cola Maatschappij) suffered the same difficulties as the German Coca-Cola plant. Keith put the Fanta brand at the disposal of the Dutch Coca-Cola plant, of which he had been appointed the official caretaker. Dutch Fanta had a different recipe from German Fanta, using elderberries as a main ingredients.

Fanta production was discontinued in 1949. In 1955, in Naples, Italy, production of a new formulation with oranges began.

=== Modern product ===
Following the launch of several drinks by Pepsi-Cola in the 1950s, Società Napoletana Imbottigliamento Bevande Gassate (SNIBEG) relaunched Fanta in 1955 with a different formulation. In 1960 Coca-Cola bought the brand, distributing it worldwide. The drink was heavily marketed in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, although it did not become widely available in the United States until the 1960s because the company feared it would undermine the strong market position of their flagship cola. Even then, its availability was limited especially after the 1980s due to sister brand Minute Maid selling similar products under its own name. In 2001, Fanta received a national push due to the U.S.&#x27;s growing Hispanic population and the drink&#x27;s proven popularity in Latin America.

The modern-day orange Fanta was first produced in Naples, Italy in 1955 by a local bottling plant using locally sourced oranges. The design of the classic annulated bottle comes from these years.

==Marketing==
===75th anniversary version===
In February 2015, a 75th-anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany. Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original wartime flavor including 30% whey and pomace, it is described on the packaging as &quot;less sweet&quot; and a German original. An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca-Cola company wanted to bring back &quot;the feeling of the Good Old Times&quot; which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule. The ad was subsequently replaced.
==Logo history==
==International availability==
The Orange flavor recipe outside the US contains orange juice, while the American version does not.

In Mexico, Fanta is made with sugar whereas the US version uses high fructose corn syrup. In the UK, the sugar content was reduced in 2017 to 4.6g per 100ml in the standard version (non-sugar free) to ensure that the product was below the 5g that would incur the country&#x27;s sugary drink tax. This was a third lower than the recipe used before 2016, as some of the sugar was replaced by sweeteners.

In Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Poland, Serbia, Romania, Sweden, and some other European countries, there is &quot;Fanta Shokata&quot; (a wordplay on &quot;soc&quot; which means both &quot;elderberry&quot; and &quot;shock&quot; in Romanian) based on an elderflower blossom extract drink. In Russia, however, &quot;Shokata&quot; is the rebranding of &quot;Fanta Citrus&quot;, which is more like a common lemonade. This version of the drink is clear, like ordinary lemonade, while the bottle is blue-colored.

In early February 2023, The Coca Cola Company announced that Lilt (a pineapple and grapefruit soft drink sold in countries such as the UK and Ireland) would be rebranded as Fanta Pineapple and Grapefruit flavor on 14 February 2023.

In August 2024, to promote the film &quot;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&quot;, the limited edition &quot;Haunted Apple&quot; flavor was released.

<text>Foča (, ) is a town and municipality of south-eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, located in the Republika Srpska entity on the banks of Drina river. As of 2013, the town has a population of 12,234 inhabitants, while the municipality has 18,288 inhabitants.
Foča houses some faculties (including the Medical and Orthodox Theological Faculty of Saint Basil of Ostrog) from the Istočno Sarajevo University. It is also home to the &quot;Seminary of Saint Peter of Sarajevo and Dabar-Bosna&quot;, one of seven seminaries in the Serbian Orthodox Church. Foča was also, until 1992, home to one of Bosnia&#x27;s most important Islamic high schools, the Madrasa of Mehmed Pasha Kukavica. The Sutjeska National Park, which is the oldest National Park in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is located in the municipality.

==History==
===Early history===

The town was known as Hotča or Hoča during medieval times. It was then known as a trading centre on route between Ragusa (now Dubrovnik) and Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey). Alongside the rest of Gornje Podrinje, Foča was part of the Serbian Empire until 1376, when it was attached to the Kingdom of Bosnia under King Tvrtko, king of Serbs, Bosnia, Coastal Lands and Zachlumia. After Tvrtko&#x27;s death, the town was ruled by the dukes of Zachlumia, most notably was Herzog Šćepan. Foča was the seat of the Ottoman Sanjak of Herzegovina established in 1470, and served as such until 1572, when the seat was moved to Pljevlja.

===World War II===

In 1941, the Ustaše killed the leading Serbs in Foča. Between December 1941 and January 1942 over two thousand Bosnian Muslim civilians were killed in Foča by the Chetniks as act of vengeance for repression over Serbs by Muslim soldiers in the ranks of the Ustaše. Additionally Chetniks attacked Ustaše and in Foča in August 1942. Judita Alargić was commissar of the Central Hospital (sr) from 1942.
On 13 February 1943, Pavle Đurišić reported to Draža Mihailović the actions undertaken by the Chetniks in the Foča, Pljevlja, and Čajniče districts: &quot;All Muslim villages in the three mentioned districts were totally burned so that not a single home remained in one piece. All property was destroyed except cattle, corn, and senna.&quot;

In the operation Chetnik losses &quot;were 22 dead, of which 2 through accidents, and 32 wounded. Among the Muslims, around 1,200 fighters and up to couple of thousands of civilian victims of both nationalitys.&quot; Đurišić said what remained of the Muslim population fled and that actions were taken to prevent their return. The municipality is also the site of the legendary Battle of Sutjeska between the Tito&#x27;s Yugoslav Partisans and the German army. A monument to the Partisans killed in the battle was erected in the village of Tjentište.

===Bosnian War ===

In 1992, at the onset of the Bosnian War, the city fell under the control of the Army of Republika Srpska.
From 7 April 1992 to January 1994, Serb military, police and paramilitary forces enacted a campaign of ethnic cleansing in the area of Foča against Bosniak civilians. By one estimate, around 21,000 non-Serbs left Foča after July 1992. Most of them that managed to escape were settled in the town of Rožaje in Montenegro until the war ended. Only about 10 Muslims remained at the end of the conflict. Thirteen mosques including the Aladža Mosque were destroyed and the 22,500 Muslims who made up the majority of inhabitants fled. The Tribunal Judges determined beyond a reasonable doubt that the purpose of the Serb campaign in Foča was, among others, &quot;to cleanse the Foča area of Muslims&quot; and concluded that &quot;to that end the campaign was successful.

In numerous verdicts, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) ruled that the ethnic cleansing, killings, mass rapes, and the deliberate destruction of Bosniak property and cultural sites constituted crimes against humanity. According to the Research and Documentation Center (IDC), 2,707 people were killed or went missing in the Foča municipality during the war. Among them were 1,513 Bosniak civilians and 155 Serb civilians. Additionally, Bosnian Serb authorities set up rape camps in which hundreds of women were raped. Numerous Serb officers, soldiers and other participants in the Foča massacres were accused and convicted of war crimes by the ICTY.

=== Post-war period ===
In 1995 the Dayton Agreement created a territorial corridor linking the once-besieged city of Goražde to the Federation entity; as a consequence, the northern part of Foča was separated to create the municipality of Foča-Ustikolina. Prior to that in 1994, the ethnically-cleansed town was renamed &quot;Srbinje&quot; (), &quot;place of the Serbs&quot;. In 2004, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared the name change unconstitutional, and reverted it back to Foča.

Since the war, around 4,000 Bosniaks have returned to their homes in Foča, and several mosques have been re-built. This has taken place largely due to the administration of Zdravko Krsmanović, who was mayor from 2004 to 2012. In the 2012 elections, however, Krsmanović was defeated and a new mayor, Radisav Mašić, was elected with support of parties SDS and SNSD.
The Aladža Mosque was rebuilt from 2014 and reopened in May 2019.

In October 2004, members of the Association of Women Victims of War (&quot;Udruzenje Žene-Žrtve Rata&quot;) attempted to lay a plaque in front of the &quot;Partizan&quot; sports hall (also used in 1992 as a rape camp) to commemorate the crimes that occurred there. Around 300 Bosnian Serbs, including members of the Association of the Prisoners of War of Republika Srpska, prevented the plaque from being affixed.

The &quot;Partizan&quot; sport hall was reconstructed by UNDP, with EU funding, following a selection by the Foča municipal council, also with the participation of elected representatives of local returnees.

In 2018 and 2019, the association of war victims have been commemorating rape as a weapon of war by congregating in front of Karaman&#x27;s House in Miljevina and of the &quot;Partizan&quot; sport hall in Foča on the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict (19 June).

In 2021, a memorial to convicted Srebrenica massacre perpetrator Ratko Mladić was painted near a school in the town.

<text>Bullock&#x27;s oriole (Icterus bullockii) is a small New World blackbird. At one time, this species and the Baltimore oriole were considered to be a single species, the northern oriole. This bird is named after William Bullock, an English amateur naturalist.

==Description==

Bullock&#x27;s orioles are sexually dimorphic, with males being more brightly colored than females. In addition, adult males tend to be slightly larger and heavier than females.

Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

Adults have a pointed bill with a straight culmen. In adult males, the tail is long, square, and jet black. All exposed skin is black, as are the claws and bill, though the base of the lower mandible lightens to bluish-gray.

Adult males are characterized by strongly contrasting orange and black plumage, a black throat patch, and a white wing bar. The underparts, breast, and face are orange or yellow; by contrast, the back, wings, and tail are black. A black line extends from each eye to the black crown. The wing coverts (feathers not directly used in flight) are fringed white, forming a wing patch. Although the tail is mostly black, the outermost three or four rectrices (flight feathers) are tipped orange, forming a &quot;T&quot; shape. Adult females, by contrast, have gray-brown upperparts, duller yellow on the breast and underparts, and an olive crown. Some females may also have a dark throat patch, similar to (but less extensive than) the one found in adult males; in all cases, females lack the black eye-line present in adult males. Females with throat patches are thought to be older individuals.

Following the general pattern observed among icterids, the overall plumage pattern seen in immature male Bullock&#x27;s orioles closely resembles that seen in adult females. Juveniles resemble adult females, but have darker wings, fresh wing coverts, and a pink or whitish bill. Sexual dimorphism is not obvious in juveniles.

==Reproduction==
Bullock&#x27;s orioles are seasonally monogamous. The breeding season typically lasts from May until July. The exact timing of the beginning of the breeding season tends to vary geographically; in general, breeding begins later in the northernmost and westernmost portions of its geographic range. Mated pairs of Bullock&#x27;s orioles cooperate to weave deep, pendant baskets in which are deposited between three and six eggs, though females tend to do much of the work. The nest is woven of plant fibers, primarily bark and fine grass fiber, though animal hair is also commonly used. The nest is lined with down, hair, and moss.

Both males and females rear the young and defend the nest from predators and nest parasites.

Bullock&#x27;s orioles and Baltimore orioles typically hybridize in the Midwest where their geographic ranges overlap.

==Communication==
Both males and females sing. While males have a sweeter voice, females tend to be more prolific singers. This bird&#x27;s song is similar to that of the Baltimore oriole, but faster and somewhat more harsh.

==Distribution==
Bullock&#x27;s orioles are native to western North America, though they are sometimes found as vagrants in the eastern half of the continent. During the breeding season, they are found as far west as the eastern foothills of the Cascade Range. Their breeding range stretches east to the Dakotas, Kansas, and northern Central Texas. This species can be found as far north as British Columbia in Canada and as far south as Sonora or Durango in Mexico. It is common throughout its range, but is absent in parts of Arizona and Idaho, where a combination of extreme elevation and an arid climate make for poor living conditions. During winter, this species retreats to Mexico and northern Central America. Its winter range extends south and east from Sinaloa to Oaxaca.

==Behavior==

===Habitat===
Like other members of the Icteridae, Bullock&#x27;s orioles prefer habitat edges. They especially prefer riparian corridors, open deciduous woodland, and scrub forest. Observations during the breeding season indicate that members of this species prefer areas with an abundance of cottonwood, pecan, and (if near water) willow. In dry areas, this species prefers salt cedar and mesquite. In California, eucalyptus trees are used as major sources of nectar.

===Diet===
These birds forage in trees and shrubs, also making short flights to catch insects. They mainly eat insects, berries, and nectar. Other fruits eaten include oranges and sometimes grapes. In some locations, they may be seen using hummingbird feeders.

These birds readily come to a dish filled with grape jelly. Their parents lead the fledglings, feed them jelly, and then the adult males leave the area. The young stay at the jelly dish from first feeding in early July and leave late September.

==Related species==
For a time Bullock&#x27;s orioles were considered conspecific with Baltimore orioles, but breeding data, later followed by data on molt timing and DNA, showed that Bullock&#x27;s orioles are a distinct species.

<doc id="384384" wikidata="Q371942" url="?curid=384384" title="Solomon Lefschetz">
<text>Solomon Lefschetz (; 3 September 1884 – 5 October 1972) was a Russian-born American mathematician who did fundamental work on algebraic topology, its applications to algebraic geometry, and the theory of non-linear ordinary differential equations.

==Life==
He was born in Moscow, the son of Alexander Lefschetz and his wife Sarah or Vera Lifschitz, Jewish traders who used to travel around Europe and the Middle East (they held Ottoman passports). Shortly thereafter, the family moved to Paris. He was educated there in engineering at the École Centrale Paris, but emigrated to the US in 1905.

He was badly injured in an industrial accident in 1907, losing both hands. He moved towards mathematics, receiving a Ph.D. in algebraic geometry from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1911. He then took positions in University of Nebraska and University of Kansas, moving to Princeton University in 1924, where he was soon given a permanent position. He remained there until 1953.

In the application of topology to algebraic geometry, he followed the work of Charles Émile Picard, whom he had heard lecture in Paris at the École Centrale Paris. He proved theorems on the topology of hyperplane sections of algebraic varieties, which provide a basic inductive tool (these are now seen as allied to Morse theory, though a Lefschetz pencil of hyperplane sections is a more subtle system than a Morse function because hyperplanes intersect each other). The Picard–Lefschetz formula in the theory of vanishing cycles is a basic tool relating the degeneration of families of varieties with &#x27;loss&#x27; of topology, to monodromy. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1920 in Strasbourg. His book &quot;L&#x27;analysis situs et la géométrie algébrique&quot; from 1924, though opaque foundationally given the current technical state of homology theory, was in the long term very influential (one could say that it was one of the sources for the eventual proof of the Weil conjectures, through SGA 7 also for the study of Picard groups of Zariski surface). In 1924 he was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize for his work in mathematical analysis. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1925 and the American Philosophical Society in 1929.

The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem, now a basic result of topology, was developed by him in papers from 1923 to 1927, initially for manifolds. Later, with the rise of cohomology theory in the 1930s, he contributed to the intersection number approach (that is, in cohomological terms, the ring structure) via the cup product and duality on manifolds. His work on topology was summed up in his monograph &quot;Algebraic Topology&quot; (1942). From 1944 he worked on differential equations.

He was editor of the &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; from 1928 to 1958. During this time, the &quot;Annals&quot; became an increasingly well-known and respected journal, and Lefschetz played an important role in this.

In 1945 he travelled to Mexico for the first time, where he joined the Institute of Mathematics at the National University of Mexico as a visiting professor. He visited frequently for long periods, and during 1953–1966 he spent most of his winters in Mexico City. He played an important role in the foundation of mathematics in Mexico, and sent several students back to Princeton. His students included Emilio Lluis, José Adem, Samuel Gitler, Santiago López de Medrano, Francisco Javier González-Acuña and Alberto Verjovsky.

Lefschetz came out of retirement in 1958, because of the launch of Sputnik, to augment the mathematical component of Glenn L. Martin Company&#x27;s Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS) in Baltimore, Maryland. His team became the world&#x27;s largest group of mathematicians devoted to research in nonlinear differential equations. The RIAS mathematics group stimulated the growth of nonlinear differential equations through conferences and publications. He left RIAS in 1964 to form the Lefschetz Center for Dynamical Systems at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.

<text>Mark Ronald Holden (born 27 April 1954) is an Australian singer, actor, TV personality, record producer, songwriter, and barrister. He was a pop star in the 1970s and had four top 20 hit singles, &quot;Never Gonna Fall in Love Again&quot; (May 1976), &quot;I Wanna Make You My Lady&quot; (September), &quot;Last Romance&quot; (November) and &quot;Reach Out for the One Who Loves You&quot; (October 1977). Holden regularly appeared on national pop music show, &quot;Countdown&quot;. Holden is remembered for his clean-cut image, his white dinner suit and his penchant for handing out carnations to girls on the set of the popular television show &quot;Countdown&quot; – he was nicknamed &quot;The Carnation Kid&quot;. In the 1980s he worked as a songwriter in Los Angeles providing material recorded by Meat Loaf, Joe Cocker, Gladys Knight, Bob Welch and Steve Jones. He was one of three original judges on the television series &quot;Australian Idol&quot; (2003–07) and the first season (2005) of &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Mark Ronald Holden was born on 27 April 1954 to Helen (née King) and Ron Holden at Calvary Hospital, North Adelaide. His father&#x27;s family were involved with the Holden and Sloggetts Travelling Circus; although Ron became an architect and Helen was a teacher.

In the mid-1960s, Holden became involved in music after inheriting a guitar from his older brother Craig. Holden attended Westminster School in Adelaide and formed a school band. Holden began writing songs and took classical vocal lessons with Lewis Dawe. In a 2010 interview with the ABC, Holden said the band was encouraged; &quot;I remember we were given a room under a stairwell to rehearse our band.&quot; In 1972, Holden enrolled at the University of Adelaide where he studied law for three years.

In 1972, Holden was encouraged by a neighbour to audition for &quot;Adelaide Tonight&quot;, a local television show hosted by Ernie Sigley. Holden attended an open audition along Tynte Street, North Adelaide, singing an original song and &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk with God&quot;, where he was successful and performed on the show a number of times. In 1973, Sigley moved to Melbourne and launched his own show &quot;The Ernie Sigley Show&quot;. Sigley invited Holden to Melbourne, where he performed on this show. Throughout 1973, Holden travelled between Melbourne and Adelaide, balancing his music and law degree.

===1974–1977: Music career===
In 1974, Holden entered &quot;Showcase &#x27;74&quot;, a television talent show on Network 9 where he sang original folky songs. Holden ultimately placed fifth. John Bromwell from Essex Music encouraged Holden to relocate to Sydney and arranged a meeting with Peter Dawkins a record producer with EMI Music who signed Holden. Holden&#x27;s debut album &quot;Dawn in Darkness&quot; was released in 1975, in which Holden wrote or co-wrote all tracks.

From 1975 to 1976, Holden performed as Joseph in the first Australian production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; at the Seymour Centre, Sydney. He was the first pop star in the world to play the lead role.

In April 1976, Holden released a cover of Eric Carmen&#x27;s &quot;Never Gonna Fall in Love Again&quot;. The song became a hit peaking at number 13 on the Australian Kent Music Report. He released &quot;I Wanna Make You My Lady&quot; in August and &quot;Last Romance&quot; in November, which both peaked at number 11. Holden issued his second studio album, &quot;Let Me Love You&quot;. At the &quot;TV Week&quot; King of Pop Awards of 1976 he won Most Popular New Talent.

In 1977, Holden released &quot;Hey, My Love&quot; in February which peaked at number 32, and &quot;Reach Out for the One Who Loves You&quot; in August, which peaked at number 17.
Holden&#x27;s third album &quot;Encounter&quot; was released in September 1977. Both &quot;Let Me Love You&quot; and &quot;Encounter&quot; were each certified double gold for shipment of 50,000 copies.

===1976–1978: TV &amp; film===
In 1976, Holden played the role of Greg Mason on the TV soap opera &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;.
In 1977, he starred in &quot;Blue Fire Lady&quot; and &quot;Newsfront&quot; and &quot;Reach for the Stars&quot; and Case for the Defence in 1978.

At the Logie Awards of 1977, Holden won Most Popular Australian TV Teenage Personality and the George Wallace Memorial Logie for Best New Talent. He won Most Popular Australian TV Teenage Personality in 1978 also.

===1979–1983: Music in Los Angeles===
In 1979, Holden relocated to Los Angeles and signed with American label Scotti Brothers Records. His first release on this label was &quot;Stay&quot; which he co-wrote with Gloria Sklerov. The song didn&#x27;t chart but was covered by John Schneider on his 1981 album, &quot;Now or Never&quot;. Mark recorded &quot;Scintillating Lady&quot; which he co-wrote with Roger Atkins, and was due to launch his American career with a performance of the song live on CBS; however, just before the performance, his wisdom teeth needed removing and he sang the song though pain and a swollen mouth. The song was poorly received and not released. Holden and Scotti Brothers Records parted ways.

In 1983, Holden released his fourth studio album, &quot;Mark Holden&quot; on Casablanca Records, in which he co-wrote all of the tracks. The album did not chart and Holden began to focus on writing and producing.

===1984–1996: Music producer in Los Angeles===
After the lack of success of &quot;Mark Holden&quot;, Holden focussed on becoming a songwriter and music producer. He formed a company called Multimedia with Anthony Curtis and Dan Wilson and over the next decade co-wrote two top ten hits on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs for the Temptations, &quot;Lady Soul&quot; (June 1986) and &quot;Look What You Started&quot; (1987). There were also hits with Tracie Spencer, Joey Lawrence, Will Downing, a #1 dance hit with Kathy Sledge, and over 50 cover recordings of his songs from artists as varied as Belinda Carlisle, Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols, The Manhattans, Donny Osmond, José Feliciano, Fleetwood Mac, David Hasselhoff, Scarlett and Black and Branford Marsalis. He also developed and produced artists including model and actress Milla Jovovich (&quot;The 5th Element&quot;), for EMI Records Group, New York. This led to her debut album; a US Top Ten Post Modern hit, it won critical raves including a 3-star review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

For three years between 1992 and 1995, Holden worked with David Hasselhoff, producing and coordinating his albums, live promotion and musical projects for television, particularly in Europe where David enjoyed multi-platinum successes including the Top Ten hit in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, &#x27;Wir Zwei Allein Heut Nacht&#x27; (&#x27;Together alone tonight&#x27;) which Mark wrote with David Hasselhoff. Jeremy Jackson, the actor who played David Hasselhoff&#x27;s son on &quot;Baywatch&quot;, was signed to Mark Holden&#x27;s production company and had two hits in Europe including &quot;You Can Run&quot; which was Top 5 in the Netherlands.

In 1995, Holden&#x27;s second child Katie was born. Amid the rising violence in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, Holden and his partner Anna decided to move back to Australia in September 1996.

===1996–2007: Marjac Productions, &quot;Australian Idol&quot; &amp; &quot;The X Factor&quot;===

In 1996, Holden recommenced his law degree and by 1997 was keen to get back into the music business. He teamed with Jack Strom who he knew from the early 1970s and was the producer of Red Faces on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;. The pair listened to a number of demos before visiting a Russian restaurant in Carnegie where they met a 15-year-old Vanessa Amorosi. They signed her and launched her career in 1999. Amorosi&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Power&quot; peaked at number 1 and was certified 4 times platinum in Australia. At the APRA Music Awards of 2001, Amorosi&#x27;s &quot;Shine&quot; won Most Performed Australian Work, in which Holden co-wrote. Strom and Holden formed MarJac Productions and wrote songs and helped launch careers of Delta Goodrem, Nikki Webster and Sophie Monk.

In 1999, Holden performed his show &quot;100 Years of Australian Music&quot; at the School of Arts Café in Queanbeyan and hosted the Silver Jubilee edition of &quot;Countdown&quot;. In 2002, Holden was honoured by &quot;This is Your Life&quot;.

In 2003, Holden was a judge on the inaugural season &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, where he remained for five seasons until 2007. Holden executive-produced the &quot;Final 12&quot; cast CD for &quot;Australian Idol&quot; which went double platinum and included the song &quot;Rise Up&quot; which he co-wrote with Vanessa Amorosi and peaked at number 1 on the ARIA Charts. His phrase &quot;Touchdown&quot; became the highest form of accolade for the contestants. Cosima De Vito received the first touchdown, for her rendition of Cold Chisel&#x27;s &quot;When the War Is Over&quot;. In 2003, Holden appeared in cameo acting roles on &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;.

In 2004 Holden signed and managed Joel Turner, a beat-boxer from &quot;Idol&quot;. Credited to Joel Turner and the Modern Day Poets, their first single &quot;These Kids&quot; reached #1 on the ARIA Charts and achieved double platinum status.

The DVD was produced by Drew Thompson and released in 2005 as a DVD + CD through Thompson Music. In 2004, Mark&#x27;s family group, The Holdens, released their first CD, &quot;A Tribute to Tex Morton&quot;. The album featured songs made famous by the legendary country singer Tex Morton.

In 2005, Holden appeared as a judge on the first season of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, along with John Reid and Kate Ceberano. The R&amp;B group he mentored during the show, Random, went on to win, becoming the first group anywhere in the world to do so.

On 14 June 2005 Holden was one of the guest hosts that stood in for Bert Newton on morning program &quot;Good Morning Australia&quot; (GMA). Both Australian Idol and GMA aired on Network Ten.

By late 2005, Amorosi ended her 7-year contract with MarJac and signed with Ralph Carr Management, Sony BMG were in dispute with Holden regarding Delta Goodrem and Turner had requested to cease his contract with MarJac, involving Holden in a legal dispute to being 2006.

He also hosted the short lived show in 2007, &quot;The Dicko, Holden and Chrissie Show&quot; on Nova FM.

At the end of the fifth season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in 2007, Holden was told he wasn&#x27;t required on the show any longer.

From January to May 2008, Holden played the role of Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s manager Lee Gordon in &quot;Shout! The Legend of The Wild One&quot;. In 2010, Holden had a cancer removed from his neck, affecting his vocal cords.

In 2010, he guest starred as Doctor Wallace in Season 5 of &quot;Sea Patrol&quot;, which aired in July 2011.

From 2012 to 2014 Holden began researching and placing together information from his great-uncle Aldophus Holden&#x27;s travelling circus from the 1890s. Holden made five 24-minute short films about the circus, including footage from the 1950s and 60s. Holden recorded a soundtrack with his family, including his daughter Katie singing and his son Cain co-writing &quot;Rambling Man&quot;. The &quot;Holden Brothers Travelling Circus&quot; documentary and soundtrack were released on iTunes in September 2014.

To promote the series, Holden appeared on &quot;Celebrity Come Dine With Me Australia&quot; in January 2014. On 28 August 2014, it was announced Holden would be a participant on the 14th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; commencing in September. Holden had been asked in early seasons but declined. He saw this as an opportunity to promote &quot;Holden Brothers Travelling Circus&quot; and Network Seven agreed to air the show in December, although this never occurred.

In week one of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, Holden did a dance tributing &quot;The Carnation Kid&quot; from 40 years ago. In week two, he danced a waltz to The Beatles&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;. Holden was receiving positive feedback from judges and audience despite his lack of dancing ability. In week three, Holden dressed up and danced as Bobo the Clown. Intended to be homage to a childhood clown, the performance received high-profile condemnation with people calling his performance a &quot;disaster on the dance floor&quot;, &quot;one of the scariest things I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; and &quot;a train wreck&quot;. Holden received 4 out of 40 (the lowest score possible) and was voted out of the show.

Holden subsequently apologised for his behaviour saying &quot;I want to apologise to everyone I&#x27;ve offended, I want to apologise to Channel Seven, to all the contestants on DWTS, and to the judges.&quot;

Following the Bobo incident, Holden self-released &quot;Holden Brothers Travelling Circus&quot; on CD/DVD in December 2014.

In May 2017, Holden released his autobiography, titled, &quot;My Idol Years&quot;.

Holden produced Judith Durham&#x27;s 2018 album, &quot;So Much More&quot;.

During the Adelaide Cabaret Festival in June 2018 Holden said &quot;I&#x27;m about to do a limited release of a CD called &quot;Mark Holden – The Lost &#x27;80s Album&quot;. It&#x27;s a collection of songs I recorded in the &#x27;80s when I was a journeyman songwriter in LA. Looking back on all those songs and recordings I was rewriting the same song over and over again centred on my relationship with my now wife and the ultimate conception and birth of our now 22-year-old daughter Katie.&quot;

In September 2020, Holden and his daughter Katie commenced releasing &quot;The Idol Archives&quot; podcast, which sees the duo chat to former Idol contestants about their memories, in this behind-the-scenes look at the reality show.

<text>The Mannerheim Line (, ) was a defensive fortification line on the Karelian Isthmus built by Finland against the Soviet Union. While this was never an officially designated name, during the Winter War it became known as the Mannerheim Line, after Finnish Army&#x27;s then commander-in-chief Field Marshal Baron Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. The line was constructed in two phases: 1920–1924 and 1932–1939. By November 1939, when the Winter War began, the line was by no means complete.

==History of construction==
===Background===
After the October Revolution in the Russian Empire, the Finns declared independence in 1917. Although the Soviet Union recognized Finland&#x27;s independence, the Finns did not trust their sincerity. The relationship between the two countries deteriorated, with Soviet Russia supporting the Red Guard during the Finnish Civil War in 1918. After the victory of the White Guard, a group of Finnish communists fled to Soviet Russia and established the Communist Party of Finland.

The situation was considered dangerous for a new nation like Finland, especially as the capital of the new communist revolution was nearby Petrograd, (now Saint Petersburg). Furthermore, before the Treaty of Tartu in 1920, the border area was restless. The former general of Imperial Russia, C.G.E. Mannerheim, strongly opposed the Bolsheviks (Communists). Construction work on the Karelian Isthmus had already begun when the Bolsheviks won the Russian Civil War in 1922. The line was constructed in two phases: In 1920–1924 and 1932–1939.

===Planning in 1918===
During the civil war of 1918, the Finnish government and high command started to develop defence plans to protect against possible attacks from the Soviet Union. The main such route was the Karelian Isthmus. The most endangered part of that isthmus was to the west, near the Gulf of Finland, the eastern part was better protected by the natural water-ways of Vuoksi, Suvanto and Taipaleenjoki. The first plans for a defensive line were commissioned by Mannerheim from the Swedish volunteer Lieutenant Colonel A. Rappe at the beginning of May 1918. Rappe&#x27;s line was placed close to the border and designed to protect two rail lines that crossed the border, which could be used in a counterattack toward Petrograd. When Mannerheim resigned at the end of May, Rappe&#x27;s plans were abandoned.

The young nation possessed no guard troops, and the border area was insecure. Security of the border on the isthmus was the responsibility of the 2nd Division and local White Guard units in June 1918. In that form they were also entrusted with the security of the fortification construction. First efforts were weak depots without any concrete.

The Germans had ordered Colonel Otto von Brandenstein to investigate defensive positions on the Karelian Isthmus; he delivered his plan on 16 July. He was the first to suggest using the lake isthmuses, where smaller lakes like Lake Kuolemajärvi, Lake Muolaa, Lake Suvanto and the Taipaleenjoki river divided the Karelian Isthmus to the shorter land sections, as defensive positions, his plan was initially approved by the Finnish high command in August 1918. In October 1918, the Finnish government allocated 300,000 marks for the work, which was to be carried out by German and Finnish sappers as well as Russian prisoners of war. However, the money allocated was insufficient and a lack of building materials and a qualified workforce hampered the building of proper fortifications. With Germany&#x27;s defeat in The Great War, von Brandenstein&#x27;s plan was scrapped.

===Unreinforced concrete bunkers in 1919–1924===
During October 1919 Finnish Chief of Staff Major General Oscar Enckell sited the line, mostly following the original course that von Brandenstein had presented. Major J. Gros-Coissy, a member of the French military commission, designed the fortifications together with Finnish Lt Col Johan Fabritius. During the first building period, Fabritius suggested moving the defensive line further to the south-east. The general staff discussed the issue, but Enckell&#x27;s earlier plans were followed. Furthermore, insufficient funds resulted in a disagreement between the officers and Enckell resigned in 1924. Construction work was interrupted for a long period.

The prime contractor of the fortifications was the Finnish construction company Ab Granit Oy. The first hundred small bunkers were built in 1920–1924. For reasons of cost, the first phase hard fortifications were of unreinforced concrete, which provided only partial protection. The compression density of the concrete was too low to offer resistance to anything larger than medium artillery.

===First large bunkers 1932–1937===
The second construction phase started on 1 April 1934, with Fabritius in command of the construction work. He designed two new kinds of bunker, Ink 1 and Ink 2. The bunkers were mainly designed for troop accommodation, but loopholes were crafted into armour plate in 1938 and 1939. A bunker was typically 15–20 meters in length and 5–6 meters wide. A pioneer battalion constructed six bunkers in the Inkilä sector.

Between 1932 and 1938 the defence budget was such that the Finns could only construct two or three bunkers per year. In 1936 and 1937 they constructed two large strong-points, Sk 10 and Sj 4 in the Summankylä and Summajärvi areas. Two smaller bunkers, Le 6 and 7, in the Leipäsuo sector, and Ink 6, in the Inkilä sector, were also built. New bunkers differed from earlier designs in that their troop accommodation was located between the gun chambers, thus saving the cost of expensive reinforced concrete; the roof was protected by two to three meters of soil and one to three meters of stone rubble.

===The 1938 and 1939 period===
The Karelian defensive fortifications received considerably more funds and resources from May 1938, as the European situation worsened. The Finns built new strongholds and modernized old ones. In Summakylä and Summajärvi they built two large Sk 11 bunkers, a &quot;Peltola&quot;, a Sj 5, a &quot;Miljoonalinnake&quot;, and an incomplete third Sk 17. These bunkers had better fire shelters, ventilation and an observation cloche.

In Suurniemi near Muolaanjärvi, the Finns started the construction of seven new bunkers, Su 1–7. Two others, Su 3 and Su 4, were for accommodation, and the rest were for machine guns nests. They also modernised those structures built in the 1920s. The older bunkers were given added flank-fire capability and enlarged. Some bunkers&#x27; loopholes were simply closed-up as part of a plan to make them more suitable for accommodation or command posts.

The line was still incomplete in November 1939.

==Soviet intelligence==
Soviet intelligence worked in Finland on multiple levels. The Finnish communist party, run from the Soviet Union, had its own military reporting line to the Central Committee. Its intelligence concentrated on the Finnish army, recording the locations of Finnish artillery and defensive positions. The most important Soviet intelligence organisations in Finland were the NKVD and the Fourth Department of the Army General Staff. Leningrad Military District, the Baltic Fleet and border troops under the NKVD conducted espionage operations.

The Finns exposed two espionage cases during the 1930s. Vilho Pentikäinen, a photographer serving on the Finnish general Staff, escaped to the Soviet Union in 1933. The second case was of Simo Haukka; he took photographs and measured roads and terrain for Soviet intelligence in 1935.

Soviet intelligence published a top-secret and very detailed photobook of the Finnish terrain and fortifications in 1938. The book included a seven-page report and 22 pages of maps and photographs. Every issue was numbered, running probably only into dozens. Soviet intelligence activity increased in 1938 and expanded still further in 1939. Before the start of the Winter War, Soviet intelligence published a book for Red Army officers. It was called &quot;&quot;Finland. Written Description of March Routes&quot;. It was later translated and republished as the &quot;Red Army March Guide to Finland&quot;&quot;. The guide included over 200 pages of maps and photographs.

Along with the intelligence, the Soviet Union received a detailed map of the defences on the Isthmus. A German military attaché in Helsinki, General Arniké, handed it over in Moscow in September 1939.

==Structure of the Line==
The line ran from the coast of the Gulf of Finland in the west, through Summa to the Vuoksi River and ended at Taipale in the east. It consisted of 157 machine gun positions and eight artillery positions built of concrete. The area around Summa was the most heavily fortified because it was thought to be the most vulnerable position.

The Gulf of Finland coast was guarded by &quot;Fort Saarenpää&quot;, the side of Lake Ladoga (Laatokka) by &quot;Fort Järisevä&quot;. These coastal artillery positions had 5&quot;, 6&quot; and 10&quot; guns.

Unlike the French Maginot Line and other similar forts made with huge bunkers and lines of dragon&#x27;s teeth, the Mannerheim Line was mostly built by utilizing the natural terrain. Many items such as fallen trees and boulders were incorporated into defensive positions. The Finns also mastered camouflage techniques, which they put to good use.

The Mannerheim line was not constructed at great expense. Its purpose was to delay more than repel an invasion. It used predominantly local materials. The line applied the methodology of the flexible defence, thus it used trenches and obstacles rather than large bunkers.

The name Mannerheim Line was supposedly coined by Jorma Gallen-Kallela and spread by foreign journalists.

==The Winter War==
===The Red Army repelled===


In the Winter War, the line halted the Soviet advance for two months. The Soviet battleships &quot;Marat&quot; and &quot;Oktyabrskaya Revolutsiya&quot; attacked Fort Saarenpää several times during December 1939 and January 1940, but the Finns repelled the attacks, driving off the &quot;Revolutsiya&quot; by near misses on 18 December 1939.

During the war, both Finnish and Soviet propaganda considerably exaggerated the extent of the line&#x27;s fortifications: the former to improve national morale, the latter claimed it was stronger than the Maginot Line to explain the Red Army&#x27;s slow progress against the Finnish defences. Subsequently, the myth of the &quot;heavily fortified&quot; Mannerheim Line entered official Soviet war history and some western sources. The vast majority of the Mannerheim Line simply comprised trenches and other field fortifications. Bunkers along the line were mostly small and thinly spread out; the Line had hardly any artillery.

===Aftermath===
Following the Winter War, Soviet combat engineers destroyed the remaining installations. In the Continuation War the line was not re-fortified, although both Soviets and Finns used its natural benefits in defence during the Finnish advance in 1941 and the Soviet offensive in 1944 (see VT-line and VKT-line).

==Debate on the strength of the Mannerheim Line==
The first month of the Finnish campaign was humiliating for the Red Army. By the third week of the war, Soviet propaganda was working hard to explain the failure of the Red Army to the populace, and claimed that the Mannerheim Line was stronger than the Maginot Line. The Finns originally aimed to make its defence line impregnable, however actual construction progress came nowhere close to this goal by the time the Winter War broke out, in contrast to the Maginot Line which effectively deterred a cross-border assault. The Finns had funds and resources for only 101 concrete bunkers; the equivalent length of the Maginot Line had 5,800 of these structures which were also linked by underground railway connections. The weakness of the line is illustrated by the fact that the amount of concrete used in the whole Mannerheim Line——is slightly less than the amount used in the Helsinki Opera House (). The much shorter VT-line used almost of concrete.

However, &quot;flexible&quot; defense lines (Mannerheim Line, Árpád Line, Bar Lev Line) were not based on dense lines of concrete bunkers and pillboxes (as the Maginot system was). The main intention of flexible type field fortification was to close potential traffic and attack barriers with multiplied anti-tank ditches, hedgehogs, and dragon&#x27;s teeth. These were followed by a complex system of ditches and barbed wire obstacles, which protected the anti-tank barrier against sappers, bridge-layer tanks, and engineer teams. Therefore, the enemy was forced to attack trenches as in World War I, at the cost of numerous losses, without armor and direct fire support. It was termed &quot;flexible defense&quot; because defending soldiers were not &#x27;locked&#x27; into bunkers, but the defensive platoons could be regrouped between field fortifications (wood-earth firing posts, dugouts and pillboxes). They would also have the option of carrying out a counterattack. All soldiers and weapons had multiple firing positions in order to make it difficult to keep them under fire. Concrete bunkers were usually only shelters; just a few had crenels. Concrete pillboxes were side-firing in order to defend anti-tank obstacles.

Maginot and Siegfried-like bunkers had numerous weaknesses, such as having destructible air inlets and firing holes, being too large (camouflage and costs), and yet being vulnerable to small sapper teams (at Sedan, a few German soldiers destroyed several machine-gun bunkers with pre-fabricated bombs and smoke grenades), and being blinded by small concentrated smoke screens. The flexible defense lines were almost immune to small sapper teams or small smoke screens, and had no easily targetable objects.

<text>Årstad is a borough in the city of Bergen in Vestland county, Norway. Historically, the area was a separate municipality called Årstad until 1916, when it was merged into the city of Bergen. The borough has similar (but not the same) boundaries to those of the old municipality.

The borough is located south of the city centre, and has a population of around 39,906 as of 1 January 2014. Årstad is home to Bergen&#x27;s hospital, Haukeland University Hospital, as well as Norway&#x27;s second largest vocational high school, Årstad videregående skole (the largest being Sandefjord videregående skole), and Brann Stadion, the stadium of the city&#x27;s largest association football team, Brann.

==Name==
&quot;This whole area of the city was part of the king&#x27;s property Ålrekstad (Årstad)&quot;, according to encyclopedia &quot;Store norske leksikon&quot;.

The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old &quot;Årstad&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Álreksstaðir&quot;), since the first Årstad Church was built there. The first element is probably the genitive of &quot;Álrekr&quot;, the old name of the mountain Ulriken. The last element is &quot;staðir&quot; meaning &quot;farm&quot;.

==History==
During the early Viking Ages, a king of Norway is believed to have had a Kongsgård estate at the foot of Ulriken called &quot;Álreksstaðir&quot; (Alrekstad). At times the farm was the home of, at least, King Harald Fairhair, his son, King Eric Bloodaxe, Bloodaxe&#x27;s children, and King Haakon the Good (Haakon I). Later, the founder of Bergen, King Olav Kyrre (Olaf III), ruled the city from Alrekstad for 26 years. However, Alrekstad lost its importance when King Eystein I moved his seat to Holmen, located within the city limits. Around year 1300, the farm was handed over to the monastery of Nonneseter.

It is believed that the name Álreksstaðir is derived from Ulriken rather than the name Alrekr, the name &quot;Årstad&quot; being an abbreviation of the word Alrekstad. Another theory is that the farm was named after a king Alrek, who may or may not have existed, and who may have ruled over the petty kingdom of Hordariket around year 400. Today, the area where the farm was located (included in, but not limited to, the place now called Årstadvollen) is not a part of the borough of Årstad, but Bergenhus.

The 19th century was a period of heavy industrial development in the municipality of Årstad, most significantly in the bay of Solheimsviken. At the end of the century, there were approximately 25 factories in the municipality, and it was the country&#x27;s 4th largest in terms of industrial production output.

The parish of &quot;Aarstad&quot; was established as Aarstad municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). It remained a separate municipality until 1 July 1916, when it, as the second of six municipalities over the years, was merged with Bergen, increasing the area of Bergen municipality from to . The merger happened after a long political process, following decades of close cooperation between the two municipalities - most of Årstad had been included in the Bergen Police District since 1808.

==Economy==
The inhabitants of Årstad have the lowest average income of Bergen&#x27;s boroughs, earning on average almost (US$) less per annum than the inhabitants of the borough with the highest average income, Ytrebygda.

==Demographics==
As of 1 January 2008, 7.4% of the population of Årstad was 0–5 years of age. 5.5% was in the age group 6–12 years, 2.5% between 13–15 years, 69.5% between 16–66 years, 8.1% between 67–79 years, and 7.0% were over 80 years of age. In total, 15.1% of the population were over 67 years of age, the Norwegian age of retirement, the highest amount in Bergen. In 2006, the mean gross income was (approximately March 2008 USD). As of 1 January 2007, a total of 71.4% of the 6,589 couples living together were married. 43.5% were married without children, while the remaining 27.9% were married with children. 28.6% of the couples were not married; 15.9% were cohabitating couples without children while 12.7% were cohabitating with children.

==Education==
Årstad contains five elementary schools, Fridalen skole, Kronstad skole, Landås skole, Minde skole, and Slettebakken skole, one lower secondary school, Gimle skole, one combined elementary and lower secondary school, Ny Krohnborg barne- og ungdomsskole, one special school, Alrekstad alternative skole, as well as two upper secondary schools, Årstad videregående skole and Langhaugen videregående skole. Årstad videregående skole is one of the largest upper secondary schools in Norway, with a total of 300 employees and 1400 students.

Over the last few years, there have been plans to shut down several schools in the borough. Kronstad skole was proposed for closure most recently in 2006. This proposal didn&#x27;t go through, however, as the majority of the parties in the city council, as well as several parties in the opposition, voted against the school being shut down. Due to the school building being in poor condition, it was decided in 2004 that Fridalen skole was to be closed. However, following protests from the neighbourhood, the decision was retracted, at least temporarily. In 2008, the municipality released a report which predicts an increasing number of pupils in Årstad after many years of decline.

==Neighbourhoods==
The list of neighborhoods in Årstad include Gyldenpris, Kronstad, Landås, Løvstakksiden, Minde (incl. Wergeland), Nattland, Solheim, Slettebakken

Årstad is the smallest borough in Bergen (by area), but also the second most densely populated. Most of the land in the borough was already built-up before the construction of the city&#x27;s outer suburbs began in the middle of the 20th century. Årstad lacks traditional neighbourhood names as found in the city centre borough, Bergenhus, where these were established over several hundred years. Neighbourhood names are frequently named after the farm that owned the land before the area was urbanized.

Some parts of western Årstad, is however for example locally referred to as Løvstakksiden, which makes up one neighbourhood. Throughout the borough more such more or less informal neighbourhood names do also exist.

==Sports and culture==

Brann stadion, the stadium of Bergen&#x27;s most successful football club SK Brann, was constructed in the late 1910s, and opened 25 May 1919, with a match between Brann and Norway&#x27;s national team. As of June 2007, the stadium has a total seating capacity of 17,824.

Several other sport clubs have or have had their home in Årstad. The first was IL Nornen, founded in 1893 as a mountaineering, skiing, gymnastics and rowing club. Today, Nornen is mainly a gymnastics, handball and floorball club. Other sport clubs include the football club Nymark IL, Ny-Krohnborg IL, SK Baune. The main activity of most of the clubs is youth sports.

Although almost twenty buekorps have had their home in Årstad, only one, &quot;Løvstakkens Jægerkorps&quot;, still exists. As of 2000, &quot;Løvstakkens Jægerkorps&quot; is the only buekorps in the city to allow both girls and boys to join.

<text>Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant () is a Russian designer and producer of helicopters headquartered in Tomilino. It is a subsidiary of Russian Helicopters.

The Moscow Mil Helicopter Plant includes a design bureau and an experimental production plant. The Mil Design Bureau is one of the world&#x27;s leading developers of helicopters, with particular expertise in heavy-lift helicopters. It has developed both civil and military versions in a wide range of payload capacities, including the world&#x27;s largest in serial production, the Mi-26.

Ninety-five percent of the helicopters in the former Soviet Union were built to Mil designs. Series production facilities for Mil-designed helicopters include Rostvertol in Rostov-on-Don, the Kazan Helicopter Production Association, and the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant. Mil participates in the Euromil joint venture with Eurocopter.

==History==
Mil was established in 1947 under the guidance of Mikhail Mil as the helicopter laboratory of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute in Zhukovsky, Moscow Oblast. 

The Mil Mi-1 became the first mass-produced Soviet helicopter. The Mi-8 helicopter, designed in the early 1960s, was a successful design in both military and civil applications, with over 12,000 units being produced.

Mil merged with Kamov and Rostvertol to form Russian Helicopters in 2006. The Mil brand name has been retained, although the new company eliminated overlapping product lines.

<doc id="384402" wikidata="Q209663" url="?curid=384402" title="Easter Monday">
<text>Easter Monday is the second day of Eastertide and a public holiday in some countries. In Western Christianity it marks the second day of the Octave of Easter; in Eastern Christianity it marks the second day of Bright Week.

==Religious observances==

===Eastern Christianity===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Byzantine Rite Catholic Churches, this day is called &quot;Bright Monday&quot; or &quot;Renewal Monday&quot;. The services, as in the rest of Bright Week, are quite different from during the rest of the year and are similar to the services on Pascha (Easter Sunday) and include an outdoor procession after the Divine Liturgy. While this is prescribed for all days of Bright Week, often they are only celebrated on Monday and maybe a couple of other days in parish churches, especially in non-Orthodox countries.

Should the calendar date for the feast day of a major saint (e.g. Saint George on April 23, or the patron saint of a church) or one&#x27;s name day fall within Holy Week and Pascha itself, the feast is transferred to Easter Monday.

===Western Christianity===
In Western Christianity, Easter Monday is the second day of Eastertide, as well as the second day in the Octave of Easter.

In the Lutheran Churches, the Gospel for Easter Monday concerns the Road to Emmaus appearance.

==National observances==
===Australia===
In Australia, Easter Monday is a public holiday. Some people enjoy outdoor sporting events, such as the Oakbank Easter Racing Carnival in South Australia, and the Stawell Gift in Victoria, as well as a traditional AFL match between Geelong Cats and the Hawthorn Hawks at the MCG. Since 2014, The NRL have held the Easter Monday match (NRL) between the Parramatta Eels and Wests Tigers match at Stadium Australia. Australian Three Peaks Race in Tasmania until 2011.

===Austria===

In Austria and Southern Germany, there is the traditional &quot;Emmausgang&quot;, commemorating the walk of the disciples to Emmaus, to which Jesus followed them without being recognized.

===Canada===
Easter Monday () is the Monday immediately following Easter Sunday and is a statutory holiday for federal employees. Although not mandatory by federal regulation, some employers also give this day off to employees out of common practice. Additionally, this holiday succeeds Good Friday (the Friday preceding Easter), which is a mandatory holiday for all employees, giving those workers an extra long weekend in March or April. An exception to this rule is in Quebec, where employers must give either Good Friday or Easter Monday off to employees. In provinces where Family Day, Islander Day, or Louis Riel Day are not observed, Easter Weekend is the first provincial holiday after New Year&#x27;s Day.

===Central Europe===

&quot;Śmigus-dyngus&quot; (or &quot;lany poniedziałek&quot;, Polish for &quot;Wet Monday&quot;) is the name for Easter Monday in Poland and the diaspora. In the Czech Republic it is called &quot;velikonoční pondělí&quot;, in Slovakia &quot;veľkonočný pondelok&quot; and in Hungary &quot;Vízbevető&quot;. All these Catholic countries (and some others) practice the unique ancient custom on this day. Traditionally, boys and men pour a bucket of water or perfume on girls and women and/or spank their buttocks and legs with long thin twigs (pussy willow) or switches made from willow, birch or decorated tree branches. A legend says that it keep women healthy, beautiful, and fertile during the whole next year.

Another related custom, unique to Poland, is that of sprinkling bowls (garce) of ashes on people or houses, celebrated a few weeks earlier at the &quot;półpoście&quot;. This custom is almost forgotten, but still practiced in the area around the borders of Masuria and Masovia.

===Egypt===

In Egypt, the ancient festival of Sham Ennesim (, literally meaning &quot;smelling of the breeze&quot;) is celebrated by the Coptic Orthodox Church (i.e. Eastern) Easter Monday, though the festival dates back to Ancient Egypt times (about 2700 BC). It is an Egyptian national holiday. Traditional activities include painting eggshells of boiled eggs, taking meals outdoors, and eating boiled eggs, lettuce, fesikh (pickled mullet (fish)) with lemon and scallion.

===Germany===
In Germany, people go out into the fields early in the morning and hold Easter egg races. For Roman Catholics, Easter Monday is also a Holy Day of Obligation in Germany.

===Ireland===
In Ireland it is a day of remembrance for the men and women who died in the Easter Rising which began on Easter Monday 1916. Until 1966, there was a parade of veterans, past the headquarters of the Irish Republican Army at the General Post Office (GPO) on O&#x27;Connell Street, and a reading of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic.

===Italy===
In Italy, Easter Monday is an official public holiday and is called “&quot;Lunedì dell&#x27;Angelo”&quot; (“Monday of the Angel”), “&quot;Lunedì in Albis&quot;” or more commonly “&quot;Pasquetta&quot;”. It is customary to hold a family picnic in the countryside or barbecues with friends.

In Catalonia, the Land of Valencia, and Murcia a feature of this day is a pastry called Easter mona. It is usually given by godparents to their godchildren, and it is traditional for families or groups of friends to gather for a trip somewhere, like the countryside, to eat the &quot;mona&quot;.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, Easter Monday is an official public holiday. Apart from church services in some locations in the Dutch Bible Belt, there are no widespread festivities or traditions for the &quot;Second Easter Day&quot; (&quot;Tweede Paasdag&quot;).

===United States===

In the United States, Easter Monday is not a federal holiday and there are few national observances apart from traditions such as the White House Easter egg roll. On a local level, the day is informally observed in some areas such as the state of North Dakota, and some cities in New York, Michigan, and Indiana. Easter Monday was a public holiday in North Carolina from 1935 to 1987, due to the early-20th-century tradition of state government workers taking the day off to attend the annual baseball game between North Carolina State College and Wake Forest College. Texas and Maryland schools often have two holidays on Good Friday and Easter Monday. In some states and districts, public schools and universities are closed on Easter Monday, often part of spring break.

====Dyngus Day====
Traditionally Polish areas of the United States observe Easter Monday as Dyngus Day. Dyngus Day celebrations are widespread and popular in Chicago; Cleveland; Buffalo, New York; Wyandotte and Hamtramck in Michigan; South Bend and La Porte in Indiana; and Hanover, New Hampshire.

===United Kingdom===
Only England, Wales and Northern Ireland observe Easter Monday as a bank holiday, with many large retailers being closed on Easter Monday. It is not an official public holiday in Scotland, but might be locally observed, with large retailers being open; but with reduced opening hours.

<text>The orchard oriole (Icterus spurius) is the smallest species of icterid. The subspecies of the Caribbean coast of Mexico, &quot;I. s. fuertesi&quot;, is sometimes considered a separate species, the ochre oriole or Fuertes&#x27;s oriole.

The orchard oriole is a small bird with a length of 5.9-7.1 inches, a weight of 0.6-1.0 ounces, and a wingspan of 9.8 inches. Adult males have chestnut or ochre underparts, while adult females and juveniles have olive-green upper parts and yellowish breasts and bellies. They inhabit semi-open areas with deciduous trees in eastern North America, southern Tamaulipas, and Veracruz. Their winter range extends from central Sinaloa and southern Veracruz to northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela.

Orchard orioles prefer living near lakes and streams, nesting in tightly woven pouches attached to horizontal tree branches. They are nocturnal migrants and feed on insects, spiders, fruit, nectar, and seeds depending on the season. During flight, they usually swoop close to the ground and fly at or below treetop level. Courtship displays include bowing, seesawing, and begging. The species name &quot;spurius&quot; refers to their original misidentification as female Baltimore orioles, and they are sometimes mistaken for New World warblers.

==Description==
Measurements:

* Length: 5.9–7.1 in (15–18 cm)
* Weight: 0.6–1.0 oz (16–28 g)
* Wingspan: 9.8 in (25 cm)

The bill is pointed and black with some blue-gray at the base of the lower mandible. The adult male of the nominate subspecies has chestnut on the underparts, shoulder, and rump, with the rest of the plumage black. In the subspecies &quot;I. s. fuertesi&quot;, the chestnut is replaced with ochre. The adult female and the juvenile of both subspecies have olive-green on the upper parts and yellowish on the breast and belly. All adults have pointed bills and white wing bars. (Orchard orioles are considered to be adults after their second year.) One-year-old males are yellow-greenish with black lores and bib.

==Habitat and range==
The breeding habitat is semi-open areas with deciduous trees. &quot;I. s. spurius&quot; breeds in spring across eastern North America from near the Canada–United States border south to central Mexico. A 2009 study also found breeding in the thorn forest of Baja California Sur and the coast of Sinaloa during the summer &quot;monsoon&quot;; this region had previously been thought to be only a migratory stopover. &quot;I. s. fuertesi&quot; breeds from southern Tamaulipas to Veracruz. There is a record of a specimen of &quot;fuertesi&quot; from Cameron County, Texas. These birds prefer living in shaded trees within parks along lakes and streams. The nest is a tightly woven pouch attached to a fork on a horizontal branch. Their nests tend to sit close together.

The nominate subspecies&#x27; winter range extends from the coastal lowlands of central Sinaloa and southern Veracruz south to northern Colombia and northwestern Venezuela (Scharf and Kren 1996). The ochre subspecies has been observed in winter on the Pacific slope of Mexico.

Nominate orchard orioles depart from their winter habitats in March and April and arrive in their breeding habitats from late April to late May. Usually, they leave their breeding territories in late July and early August and arrive on their winter territories in mid August. These birds are nocturnal migrants.

==Diet==
While in breeding season, they eat insects and spiders. When the season changes, their diet also includes ripe fruit, which quickly passes through their digestive tract. During the winter, their diet consists of fruit, nectar, insects and seeds.

==Behavior==
When in flight, orchard orioles generally swoop close to the ground and fly at or below treetop level.

During courtship, females display themselves in three ways. The first is by bowing their head and torso toward the male. Seesawing, the second courtship display, involves repetitively alternating lowering and raising the head and tail. The third display is begging, which is fast-paced fluttering of wings halfway extended, followed by a high whistle.

==Etymology==
The specific name &quot;spurius&quot; refers to the original misidentification of the male as a female Baltimore oriole. These birds are sometimes mistakenly identified as New World warblers.

<doc id="384410" wikidata="Q44388" url="?curid=384410" title="Fgura">
<text>Fgura (, ) is a town in the South Eastern Region of Malta. It has a population of 13,066 as of 2021. Its northern fringes are bordered by the Cottonera Lines of fortifications while it merges with the towns of Żabbar to the east and Paola and Tarxien to the West. A modern settlement, Fgura expanded to the outskirts of the Grand Harbour area and was one of the fastest-growing towns of Malta. Fgura has grown to become one of the foremost commercial areas in the central-southern part of the island. Today, Fgura has one of the highest population densities in the country.

== Name and symbols ==
The name Fgura comes from the surname of the Ficura family who owner land and lived in the area when it was a rural village.

The coat-of-arms of Fgura is made up of a red horizontal stripe containing three golden 5-pointed stars, centred across a white background. Fgura Day was established by the local council in 1994, and its first celebration was held on 30 October. It is now celebrated on the last Sunday of October.

The patron saint of Fgura is Our Lady of Mount Carmel and an annual feast in her honour is celebrated on the second Sunday of July. Fgura also has one of the most peculiar shaped churches in Malta, built in the shape of a tent.

==History==
It is thought that a settlement where Fgura currently lies existed in Phoenician times. Between 28 October and 2 December 1948, six Phoenician tombs were found in Fgura, dating to the 3rd or 4th century B.C. These tombs were in irregular shapes and human skeletons, remains of animals, pottery and other Bronze materials and objects were found. In Fgura, a street was named &#x27;Triq is-Sejba Punika&#x27; - in English &#x27;Phoenician Discovery Street&#x27; - in honour of this historic finding.

Medieval archaeological remains including an Arabic inscription were discovered in Fgura during a construction project in April 2023.

Before World War II, Fgura was a rural village that consisted of a few scattered farmhouses, of which there remains practically nothing, situated near the new church, near the new school and on St. Thomas Street. There were 20 families and the people of this town were farmers. 
After the Second World War, the Carmelite Fathers were entrusted with the spiritual needs of the community. The Carmelite Fathers arrived in Fgura on 14 December 1945, where they built a new church and convent, which were inaugurated in November 1950, in the presence of Prime Minister Enrico Mizzi. Before Fgura was declared a parish on 21 January 1965, it was a suburb of Tarxien.

Lying inland from the Three Cities, Fgura was influenced by the growth of the Malta Dockyards, especially after World War II. Much of Fgura was built around the 1960s and 1980s. 
As the population grew, the need arose for the building of a new modern church. The new church was inaugurated on 25 May 1988 and was consecrated by Archbishop Joseph Mercieca on 1 February 1990.

==Fgura Local Council==

Local Councils in Malta were established through legislation in Parliament in July 1993. The first local election in Fgura was held on 16 April 1994, and successive elections were held every three years on the 2nd Saturday of March. The first mayor of Fgura was Anthony Degiovanni. He was replaced by Saviour Camilleri in 1997, but returned to his post on 1 April 2000. However Anthony Degiovanni resigned from office in 2004, and was succeeded by Darren Marmara. 
The 6th Fgura Local Council elections were held on 6 June 2009. The incumbent mayor, Darren Marmara was confirmed for the 3rd consecutive time. However, on 7 July 2010 the deputy mayor Anthony Degiovanni together with his fellow labour councillors presented a no confidence motion in the incumbent mayor, Darren Marmara. The motion was due to be discussed on 16 July, but when the local council meeting was about to commence, the mayor resigned from office, saying that in the preceding days, he and his family received various threats. No official reason was given why the mayor was forced to resign. A meeting to elect a new mayor, scheduled for 21 July had to be postponed till 3 August, after a decision by the Department of Local councils, that found that there were irregularities in the way the meeting was summoned. Newcomer Byron Camilleri, a 23-year-old law student was nominated as the fourth mayor of Fgura.

Byron Camilleri was confirmed mayor for a second term, after the elections held on 9 March 2013, but eventually resigned his seat, after he was elected in Parliament in June 2017. Pierre Dalli succeeded Byron Camilleri, and was reconfirmed as Mayor in May 2019 after obtaining the majority of votes. The new deputy mayor is Clayton Portelli Cascun. The other members of the council are: Charles Bonello, Raymond Deguara, Ryan Ellul, Mario Fava, Mark Lombardo, Toshera Schembri and Adrian Tanti. Mark Lombardo is the only councillor who was elected in all local council elections held since they were established in 1993. As of now, Clayton Cascun Portelli is now the Mayor as of the 2024 Local Council elections and the vice mayor being Darren Marmara. Other Local councilors elected are Charles Bonello, Ray Deguara, Mark Lombardo, Izak Catania De Giovanni, Dr. Ryan Ellul, Josianne Scicluna and Adrian Tanti. The local councilor Izak Catania De Giovanni has reached a record during this term being the youngest local councilor ever elected in Malta&#x27;s history and being the newcomer with the largest number of votes with 729 votes on Count 4 only being 16 years old and 114 days. He is also the youngest politician in Europe ever elected with a democratic vote.

==Places of interest==


===Parish Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel ===

The parish church of Fgura was built in 1988 and dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel on 1 February 1990, on a project by architect Victor Muscat Inglott and structural engineer Godfrey Azzopardi from the 1960s. The parish church is built in modern, post-Vatican II Council style, with a ceiling supported at four points to provide a symmetrical cross design, while retaining a square plan at the base across both axis. It was meant to be appreciated as a free-standing structure surrounded by open space. The Fgura parish church is included in the 2011 National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands under ID 00009.

===The Cross Monument===

There is a monument in Hompesch Street, which is known as &#x27;Il-Monument tas-Salib&#x27; by the Fgura residents (The Cross Monument). This monument was inaugurated by Minister Ugo Mifsud Bonnici in February 1990, exactly when Fgura celebrated its 25th anniversary when it became a parish in 1965. This monument was designed by the sculptor Ġanni Bonniċi and built by apprentices of the Ġlormu Cassar School.

This monument was placed on the exact spot where a small church dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel was built in 1790 instead of a niche that was there for a long time. The church was demolished in the 1950s to allow the widening of the road. As a remembrance of this niche, a new niche was built in Carmel Street.

The monument rests on four columns and they have a significant meaning. Three of these columns represent the towns which Fgura is adjacent to:- Paola, Tarxien and Żabbar {limits from these places were taken in order to form the Parish of Fgura in 1965}. The other one represents the Parish of Fgura. At the base of this monument there are 4 gravestones. They represent the 25th anniversary since Fgura became a parish, the inauguration of this monument and one is a copy of another gravestone that was situated at the side of a church that was built in 1844. This gravestone was written in Latin and it told the story of this church.

=== Reggie Miller Square ===
Reggie Miller Square (Wesgħa Reggie Miller) is an open space decorated with palm trees to the right side of the Parish Church. The original site had been developed into a garden which was inaugurated on 28 March 1976 by Minister Lorry Sant. Reggie Miller was a trade unionist and the founder of the General Workers&#x27; Union, the strongest trade union in Malta. The original garden featured a fish pond and a sundial designed by Paul Ignatius Micallef. Fgura Local Council, on being established in 1993, had identified this space as one if its first projects and very soon developed it into an open plan square to the design of Vice Mayor Saviour Camilleri. The new square was inaugurated on 10 February 1996. In 1996 the Fgura Local Council erected a monument of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, which was designed and executed by Fgura sculptor Alfred Camilleri Cauchi.

=== Patri Redent Gauci Gardens ===

This garden was built in 2000 by the Ministry of Social Policy as part of the scheme of Gardens in Government Housing Estates. Fr Redent Gauci who was one of the original Carmelite friars that had started the Carmilte Community in Fgura, was eventually ordained Bishop. The council had intended this garden to be family leisure grounds and have incorporated a multipurpose court, a club house, and a playing field. The garden was inaugurated by Minister Lawrence Gonzi. As part of the embellishment works within the Housing Estate, the Local Council embellished also the immediate surroundings of the nearby apartments, both from its annual allocation, together with other funds from parking schemes by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority.

=== George Stevens Square ===
On 6 September 1986, the 35th anniversary of the foundation of the Malta Literary Society, Minister Lorry Sant inaugurated a monument commemorating George Stevens, poet, author of various popular songs and co-founder of the Literary Society. A hardline Malta Labour Party member by family tradition and a very intelligent man also self-made millionaire, Prof. George Stevens was a well loved character in the port area. Even though much controversy surrounds the facts of an Italian diplomat&#x27;s murder whom Stevens confessed to. Still he was a hero to most in the southern part of Malta so a monument was erected The monument, erected in a square bearing his name, was commissioned by the Malta Literary Society and executed by sculptor Alfred Camilleri Cauchi. After the unveiling it was blessed by the Parish Priest Father Guido Micallef O. Carm. In 2000, the Fgura Local Council commissioned architect Stefan Buontempo to redesign this square and entrusted the original sculptor with the restoration of the monument and the design a new plinth. The project was inaugurated in 2001 in the presence of the Stevens family and members of the Malta Literary Society, by the President of Malta Guido de Marco.

=== Former Fgura farmhouse ===
An old farmhouse, from the early 1800s, used to stand at the crossroad of the original hamlet, in front of the former 1790 church (demolished in 1955). The farmhouse stood as the last of the fields and farmhouses owned by the &#x27;Ficura&#x27; family that, according to notarial documents from 1505, gave its name to the later town. During the second world war, it was also the site of a Victory kitchen. By the 1990s, it was the oldest building in town, surrounded by the last fields and trees in Fgura&#x27;s urban core, and the last remaining element of Fgura&#x27;s history and identity.

The old farmhouse incorporated a religious niche - which gives the name to a nearby street - and several vernacular features, including xorok, kileb, animal stalls and mangers, a barumbara, and carved decorations. In 1995 Fgura Local Council had won Grade 3 protection for the farmhouse, and expressed its wish to restore it into a much-needed public cultural centre and green open space.

Malta&#x27;s Environmental and Planning Authority refused developers&#x27; requests to de-schedule Fgura&#x27;s old farmhouse in 2009, 2011 and 2015. Yet, in February 2019, without warning, Malta&#x27;s Environment Planning Review Tribunal granted the de-scheduling requested by Robert Musumeci, appearing for Landscape Properties, who claimed the historical building had been modified across time and was now out of context, having been surrounded by modern buildings. The farmhouse was razed to the ground in 2021. Applications for a massive residential development are now being evaluated by Malta&#x27;s Planning Authority.

=== Wied Blandun ===

Wied Blandun is the only natural area included in the limits of Fgura, and one of the few remaining open spaces in the conurbation around the Three Cities. It lies immediately outside the western part of the Cottonera bastions and south of the Bormla drydocks. Wied Blandun is part of the drowned valley system of the Grand Harbour area; with a length of circa 500 metres, it is irrigated by rainwater run-off from the streets of Paola and Fgura. It comprises terraced fields and the area closest to the road which leads to Fgura includes an important stand of carobs and almonds. The valley has long been subject to important environmental degradation, being used in its lower (northern) part as dumping ground for hazardous grit blasting waste from the nearby shipyards.

In November 2001 the Malta Environmental and Planning Authority scheduled Wied Blandun for its scientific and ecological importance among the Protected areas of Malta. 
In 2015 the Maltese government allocated €125,000 for an environmental study for the rehabilitation of the valley, to include a desk study, a site description and a preliminary risk assessment, with the aim of the rehabilitation and restoration of Wied Blandun, as confirmed by Paola MP Silvio Parnis, head of the consultative council for the south of Malta.

An EU-funded catchment management study and masterplan were published in December 2020 and March 2021 respectively.

==Schools in Fgura==
Immediately after the end of World War II, in 1944, Mons. Ġużepp Zerafa, a Carmelite Frair, the same one who had charge of the chapel of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, took the initiative and applied to the Director of Education, Mr. Brennan, to open a school in Fgura. Permission was granted, and the Director of Education authorised Mr. E.B.Vella to open the school.

Today, there are two Primary schools in Fgura. They form part of St. Thomas More College. One of the Primary schools is named after Dun Ġużepp Żerafa himself, while the second school is named after Emanuel Debono Decesare.

Dun Ġużepp Żerafa Primary A school is a state school for Kindergarten and Years 1, 2 and 3, named after the priest who in 1944 took the initiative and applied to open a school in Fgura. The school population consists of around 200 kindergarten pupils and 340 Primary pupils. The school is situated in Triq il-Kitba.

Fgura Primary B School, situated in Carmel Street and named after the first headmaster, Emanuel Debono Decesare, hosts nearly 400 pupils from Fgura and the neighbouring areas.

<text>The British Optical Association (BOA) was founded in February 1895 as the first professional body for ophthalmic opticians (optometrists) in the world. The British Optical Association Museum and Library was founded in 1901; it retains the BOA name but is now part of the College of Optometrists, located in Craven Street, Charing Cross, central London.

==History==
At a meeting called by Mr Robert Sutcliffe, a sight-testing optician of Rochdale, the BOA was formed and elected the distinguished London optician John Browning (scientific instrument maker) as its first President. The BOA ran the first professional examinations in optics in 1896 and campaigned over many years for the state recognition of the profession, finally achieving success in 1958 with the passing of the Opticians Act by Parliament. It operated a number of local associations across the UK and was responsible for establishing the Army Spectacle Depot during World War I and establishing the Joint Council of Qualified Opticians (JCQO) together with the Institute of Ophthalmic Opticians (IOO) in 1922. The BOA also provided the Secretariat for a number of other optical bodies including what would eventually become the Association of Optometrists and the International Optometric and Optical League (IOOL), known since 1995 as the World Council of Optometry.

In a series of amalgamations the BOA swallowed up the smaller rival examining bodies, the National Association of Opticians (NAO) in 1955, and the Institute of Optical Science (IOSc) in 1962. In 1980, the BOA joined forces with the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers (WCSM) and the Scottish Association of Opticians (SAO, now disbanded) to found the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists); the title was changed to the British College of Optometrists in 1987 and, with the grant of a Royal Charter in 1995, the territorial distinction was dropped and the name shortened to the College of Optometrists.

Fellows of the British Optical Association were entitled to use the affix FBOA, introduced in 1897, and those who held only the Dioptric Grade the affix DBOA or the Ophthalmometric Grade, the little-used affix OBOA. These latter grades were abolished in 1923. Examinations for dispensing opticians were first introduced in 1928. The BOA also administered several higher qualifications including the Diploma in Contact Lens Practice (DCLP), introduced in 1961, and awarded the BOA Research Medal from 1953. The Association published the &quot;Dioptric Review&quot; from 1896 which continued with breaks and with minor changes of title until 1961 when it was replaced by &quot;The Ophthalmic Optician&quot; a journal jointly sponsored by the BOA and the AOP. A learned clinical journal, the &quot;British Journal of Physiological Optics&quot; was produced from 1925, on the Association&#x27;s own in-house printing press.

After a peripatetic existence in Rochdale, Blackpool and London, an &#x27;Association House&#x27; was eventually acquired in 1914 at Cliffords Inn Hall, a former Inn of Chancery close to the former Public Records Office. From 1934, when that building was compulsorily purchased for demolition, and until 1978, the BOA was housed at 65 Brook Street, Mayfair.

==British Optical Association Museum==
The British Optical Association Museum was founded in London, England, by John H. Sutcliffe OBE in January 1901 as a collection of historic spectacles and visual aids designed to illustrate the development of corrective eyewear. It subsequently expanded its collecting activities to encompass ophthalmic instrumentation and the depiction of optometric subject matter in works of art such as paintings, prints and sculpture. With over 27,000 catalogued objects (including archives) it may be judged one of the most comprehensive and high quality collections of its type. It is believed to be the oldest such museum to be open to the public. Many of its objects are rare survivals and several are unique.

The museum is located at the College of Optometrists at the north end of Craven Street, adjacent to Charing Cross railway station in Westminster. Visits to the museum gallery are free and by advance appointment only.

The BOA Museum provides a heritage service to the College, the WCSM and the wider optical professions. The public may visit the exhibition rooms (the Sutcliffe Room and Giles Room) by prior appointment or pay for a guided tour of the College meeting rooms in which various exhibits are displayed. Museum staff are available to give external lectures and objects are frequently lent to temporary exhibitions at other accredited museums in the UK and occasionally overseas.

The BOA Museum is a UK Accredited Museum and a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine.

<text>BBC UKTV is an Australian pay television channel in Australia and New Zealand, screening British entertainment programming, sourced mainly from the archives of the BBC, RTL Group (mainly Talkback Thames material) and ITV plc. The channel was originally a joint venture with Foxtel (60% ownership), the RTL Group (20% ownership) and BBC Worldwide (20% ownership). It is now owned solely by BBC Studios.

==History==
The channel was first launched in Australia in August 1996, becoming available on Austar in April 1999 and on Optus in December 2002. A New Zealand version with different programming launched on Sky TV, in November 2003.

It shows a mix of repeats of old UK shows previously screened in Australia or New Zealand and new episodes of programs not shown before in either country. Repeated series include &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, &quot;Torchwood Declassified&quot;, &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, &quot;Never the Twain&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, and &quot;The Bill&quot; that have already been seen on free-to-air terrestrial television in Australia. New series include &quot;Shameless&quot;, new episodes of popular soap operas &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot; and the original UK version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; which have not otherwise been screened in Australia. UK soap opera &quot;Family Affairs&quot;, which has never been screened on free-to-air Australian television, ran on UKTV from 1998 to 2007. In July 2006 UKTV began screening 2006 episodes of UK soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; which had never before been screened in Australia.

UKTV&#x27;s episodes of &quot;EastEnders&quot; are currently two weeks behind the United Kingdom, and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; is about one week behind. Current &quot;Emmerdale&quot; episodes currently in 2021 are about four weeks behind the original UK broadcasts.

In addition to British programming UKTV has repeated Australian soap operas &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; and &quot;Prisoner&quot; which were both produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation (now owned by FremantleMedia). In both cases the entire series was shown; the &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; repeat run was from 1997 until 2000 and &quot;Prisoner&quot; ran from 1997 until October 2004, &quot;Prisoner&quot; is now screening on 111 Hits from March 2011. It also screened the TVNZ soap opera &quot;Shortland Street&quot; for several years in the 1990s, after early episodes of that series had briefly been screened by SBS on free-to-air television in Australia.

In Australia, UKTV, like all pay TV drama channels, is legally required to spend 10 per cent of its total program expenditure on funding new eligible (Australian and New Zealand) drama programs. Such productions include &quot;Changi&quot;, &quot;Supernova&quot;, &quot;Make or Break&quot; and &quot;False Witness&quot;.

UKTV has separate services in Australia and New Zealand, partly to reflect different local tastes, but also for rights reasons, as many programmes are shown on free-to-air channels in New Zealand. For example, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; has been shown on TVNZ 1 for many years, while until May 2009, &quot;EastEnders&quot; was shown on Prime, before moving to UKTV.

On 1 July 2008 BBC Worldwide assumed full control of UKTV. BBC Worldwide previously had a 20 per cent stake in UKTV in a three way partnership with Foxtel and Fremantle Media. BBC Worldwide launched two new Australian channels, BBC Knowledge (documentary and non-fiction programming) and CBeebies (an advertising-free channel for 0 to six-year-olds) on 1 November 2008.

On 3 October 2009 UKTV revealed a new logo, displaying that of the BBC, although its name remained unchanged. On 15 November 2009 the channel launched an HD simulcast, replacing BBC HD.

In April 2013, the channel changed its logo and name to BBC UKTV.

On 1 July 2014, the HD simulcast closed, making the channel solely available in standard definition. This came prior to the launch of BBC First, which would use the HD feed formerly used by BBC UKTV. In addition, BBC UKTV changed subscription packages on Foxtel - moving from the Drama &amp; Lifestyle add-on package to the basic Essential package increasing its reach.

On 1 February 2015, BBC UKTV launched on Australian independent IPTV service Fetch TV, after they won the broadcast rights to BBC Worldwide.

From 10 October 2016, the channel refreshed its logo and branding identity, to appeal to a younger audience and better distinguish its programming from the more premium offerings on sister channel BBC First.

In September 2022, BBC Studios partnered with South African FTA broadcaster, OpenView HD, to launch the channel in the country. It will be available on Channel 114 as of 18 October 2022.

On 15 August 2024, the HD simulcast will relaunch on Foxtel.

<text>The Bordered Yellow Banner () was one of the Eight Banners of Manchu military and society during the Later Jin and Qing dynasty of China. The Bordered Yellow Banner was one of three &quot;upper&quot; banner armies under the direct command of the emperor himself, and one of the four &quot;left wing&quot; banners. The Plain Yellow Banner and the Bordered Yellow Banner were split from each other in 1615, when the troops of the original four banner armies (Yellow, Blue, Red, and White) were divided into eight by adding a bordered variant to each banner&#x27;s design. The yellow banners were originally commanded personally by Nurhaci. After Nurhaci&#x27;s death, his son Hong Taiji became khan, and took control of both yellow banners. Later, the Shunzhi Emperor took over the Plain White Banner after the death of his regent, Dorgon, to whom it previously belonged. From that point forward, the emperor directly controlled three &quot;upper&quot; banners (Plain Yellow, Bordered Yellow, and Plain White), as opposed to the other five &quot;lower&quot; banners. Because of the direct control of the three upper banners, there was no appointed banner commanders as opposed to the other five. The emperor&#x27;s personal guards and guards of Forbidden City were also only selected from the upper three banners.

<text>Alrekstad (Norwegian: &quot;Kongsgården på Alrekstad&quot;, Old Norse: &quot;Álreksstaðir&quot;) was one of the largest Kongsgård estates on the west coast of Norway during the early Middle Ages.

==History==
Alrekstad was situated at the foot of Ulriken, the highest of the Seven Mountains (&quot;de syv fjell&quot;) that surround Bergen, Norway. King Harald Fairhair took residence there in the 10th century. After the Battle of Fitjar in 960, King Haakon the Good was on his way to Alrek, but died at Håkonshella in Laksevåg.

The parish of Aarstad existed for centuries before the creation of the municipality of Aarstad in 1838. The municipality and parish of Aarstad (later spelled Årstad) was named after Alrekstad.

==Etymology==

==Presently==
The name &quot;Alrekstad&quot; evolved into today&#x27;s &quot;Årstad&quot;, the modern name of a borough of the city of Bergen. The location of Alrekstad – today referred to as &quot;Årstadvollen&quot; – is situated outside of the Årstad borough.

<doc id="384419" wikidata="Q3409186" url="?curid=384419" title="President of Ethiopia">
<text>The president of Ethiopia is the head of state of Ethiopia. The position is largely ceremonial with executive power vested in the Council of Ministers chaired by the prime minister. The current president is Taye Atske Selassie, who took office on 7 October 2024. Presidents are elected by the Federal Parliamentary Assembly for six years.

==History== 
The role of head of state of Ethiopia had evolved and changed through the political transformation of Ethiopia. The emperor of Ethiopia was the head of state of Ethiopia prior the 1974 revolution. Following the 1974 military coup and abolishment of the monarchies of Ethiopia, the role of head of state was fulfilled by the chairman of the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia as de facto president of Ethiopia.

===Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia (PMGSE) – (1974–1987)===
The chairman of the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia was head of state and de facto president of Ethiopia. The first chairman of the Provisional Military Government was Lieutenant General Aman Andom, who was also Chief of General Staff of the Ethiopian Armed forces.

===People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (PDRE) – (1987–1991)===
The presidency was officially created by the 1987 Constitution, which established the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The president was elected to a five-year term by the National Shengo (legislature), with no term limits. The presidency was the chief executive of Ethiopia. The president was also the chairman of the Council of State, which presided as a legislator during the Shengo off session. The president had a chief executive power to rule by decree if necessary and was also the commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian Armed Forces. The only president under the 1987 Constitution was Mengistu Haile-Mariam from 1987 to 1991. Following the flight into exile of Mengistu Haile-Mariam, Tesfaye Gebre Kidan served as the acting president of Ethiopia for only six days.

===Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) – (1991–1995)===
The end of the Ethiopian Civil War in 28 May 1991 resulted in the end to the People&#x27;s Democratic Republic of Ethiopia constitution. A new provisional constitution and the Transitional Government of Ethiopia was formed. The Transitional Government of Ethiopia was a de facto semi-presidential system with the president as head of state and the prime minister as head of government. During the Transitional Government of Ethiopia, the presidency had chief executive powers, including appointing and dismissing the prime minister and the commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian Armed Forces. The only president who served during the Transitional Government of Ethiopia was Meles Zenawi.

===Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (FDRE) – (1995–present)===
A draft of a new constitution was declared in 1995 as the Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia transformed Ethiopia into a parliamentary republic, which effectively made the presidency a ceremonial and apolitical head of state.

The Constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia explicitly vests executive power in the Council of Ministers and names the prime minister as chief executive and the de jure commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian Armed Forces. However, the president presides as a ceremonial commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian Armed Forces.

The first president of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia was Negasso Gidada, who served from 1995 to 2001. Sahle-Work Zewde was the first female president who had served from 2018 to 2024. The current president is Taye Atske Selassie since 7 October 2024.

==Nominations and appointment of the president==

The Federal Parliamentary Assembly nominate the candidate for president. Presidential tenure is not keyed to that of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly to assure continuity in government and the nonpartisan character of the office.

The term of office of the president is six years. As of 2021, there are no term limits for the president in the Constitution of Ethiopia. Upon election in accordance with the constitution, the president, before commencing his or her responsibility as president, presents himself or herself before the Federal Parliamentary Assembly and makes a declaration of loyalty to the Constitution and the people of Ethiopia in the following words:

&quot;I..., when on this date commence my responsibility as President of the Federal Democratic Republic, of Ethiopia, pledge to carry out faithfully the high responsibility entrusted to me.&quot;

==Powers and duties==
The 1995 Ethiopian Constitution lays out the duties and powers of the president of the republic to include the following:

# The president opens the joint session of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly at the commencement of their annual sessions.
# The president proclaims in the Negarit Gazeta laws and international agreements approved by the House of Peoples&#x27; Representatives in accordance with the Constitution.
# The president, upon recommendation by the prime minister, appoints ambassadors and other envoys to represent the country abroad.
# The president receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and special envoys.
# The president awards medals, prizes and gifts in accordance with conditions and procedures established by law.
# The president upon recommendation by the prime minister, grants high military titles and awards.
# The president, in accordance with conditions and procedures established by law, grants pardon.

The president&#x27;s powers and duties need not be countersigned by the prime minister to be valid. All the listed roles are autonomous powers of the president. The president represents the country in various delegations, meetings, and international platforms that may require the attendance of the head of state.

==Succession==
If the president is unable to preside and exercise his or her duties because of illness, death, resignation, conviction or impeachment, the two chambers of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly will immediately designate an acting president. With no longer than a week time the Federal Parliamentary Assembly will convene by an extraordinary session to elect the successor and declare the new president.

==Security==
The president of Ethiopia is protected by the Republican Guard, which is a special armed unit of the Ethiopian National Defense Force. The Republican Guard&#x27;s Counter Military Unit is responsible for protecting the presidential palace commonly known as Jubilee Palace. The Counter Military Unit carries heavy assault rifles such as Israel-made Tavor-21 and American M-4&#x27;s and long range snipers that can penetrate bullet proof glass. The Republican Guard also uses helicopters as well as armored vehicles.

<text>The University of Puget Sound (or Puget Sound) is a private liberal arts college in Tacoma, Washington, United States. It was founded in 1888. The institution offers a variety of undergraduate degrees as well as five graduate programs in counseling, education, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and public health.

Puget Sound&#x27;s athletic programs compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III Northwest Conference. The University of Puget Sound is also the only independent national undergraduate liberal arts college in the Pacific Northwest with a School of Music and School of Business and Leadership.

==History==
The University of Puget Sound was founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1888 in downtown Tacoma. The idea for a college in Tacoma originated with Charles Henry Fowler, who had previously been the president of Northwestern University. Fowler was in Tacoma for a Methodist conference when he spoke of his vision of a Christian institution of learning in the area. The conference released a report:

Two cities vied for the location of the school: Port Townsend and Tacoma. The committee eventually decided on Tacoma. A charter was drawn up and filed in Olympia on March 17, 1888. This date marks the legal beginning of the school. At this time, the school&#x27;s legal title was The Puget Sound University. In September 1890, Puget Sound opened its doors, taking in 88 students.

The beginnings of the school were marked by moral conviction: students were warned against intoxicating liquors, visits to saloons, gambling, tobacco use, and obscene drawings or writings on the college grounds. The institution also had a financially tumultuous beginning. There was no endowment and the school often struggled for funds to pay the professors. It moved locations three times in 13 years and, at one time, the school was merged with Portland University (former campus is now the University of Portland). It opened up a year later (1899) back in Tacoma on the 9th and G Street. In 1903, the school was &quot;reborn&quot; and re-incorporated as a different entity, different trustees, and a different name: the University of Puget Sound.
The character of the school changed dramatically during the presidency of Edward H. Todd (1913–1942), who worked tirelessly to bring financial and academic stability. During his tenure, the &quot;Million Dollar Campaign&quot; was started, raising $1,022,723 for buildings, equipment, and endowment. With this money, the campus moved in 1924 to its current location in the residential North End of Tacoma, with five buildings, setting a stylistic tone for the institution. In 1914, the institution was renamed the College of Puget Sound.

President R. Franklin Thompson (1942–1973) led a massive physical and institutional expansion: During this era almost all of the institution&#x27;s buildings were constructed. In 1960, the institution&#x27;s name changed from the College of Puget Sound back to the University of Puget Sound, as it is known today.

Phillip M. Phibbs presided from 1973 to 1992 and endeavored to change the tone of Puget Sound. In 1980, the institution divested its attachment with the Methodist Church, and an independent board of trustees assumed full fiscal responsibility of the institution. Also during this time, the institution began to focus on undergraduate education, phasing out all off-campus programs except the law school and most graduate programs. During this time the library collections were broadened and the faculty greatly expanded.

With the advent of President Susan Resneck Pierce (1992–2003), the law school was promptly sold to Seattle University, in a move that was calculated to focus the institution&#x27;s resources on its undergraduate campus. During her tenure, the institution completed almost $100 million of new construction and renovation. Collins Memorial Library and four academic buildings were renovated, and Wyatt Hall was constructed to house the growing class and office space needs of the Humanities Department. Trimble Residence Hall was constructed, bringing on-campus student residency to 65%. SAT scores rose from 1067 to 1253 and the endowment more than tripled.

Puget Sound&#x27;s president from 2003 to early 2016 was Ronald R. Thomas—affectionately called &quot;Ron Thom&quot; by many students—a scholar of Victorian literature, and the former vice-president of Trinity College.

In February 2016, the institution announced the selection of Isiaah Crawford to be its next president, upon Thomas&#x27;s retirement. President Crawford assumed office on July 1, 2016.

Thompson Hall, home of the sciences at the institution, underwent a major renovation, including the construction of a new wing (Harned Hall, completed 2006) on the building&#x27;s western side against Union Avenue and extensive renovations to the current wings and courtyard to allow for upgraded labs and facilities. The entire project was completed in mid 2008. The entire complex is now known locally as &quot;The Science Center at Puget Sound.&quot; The now completely enclosed courtyard contains a striking Plexiglas structure where a coffee shop, Oppenheimer Cafe, is located.

In fall 2013, Puget Sound opened Thomas Hall, a residence hall for upper-division students featuring 11 &quot;houses&quot; organized around five academic-residential programs: the Humanities Program, environmental outdoor leadership, international experiential learning, entrepreneurship, and the Honors Program. The hall is home for 135 students, and includes a seminar room, four studies, and an event/meeting space for approximately 150 people, accommodating special events, guest lectures, performances and more.

In April 2024, students joined other campuses in protesting and establishing encampments against the war and alleged genocide in Palestine. They called for divestment by the university from companies supporting the war. A talk given by US Representative Derek Kilmer was disrupted leading to 2 students being charged, 1 hospitalisation and a lockdown of the university.  The protestors alleged that the investigation leading to charges was racist.

===Presidents===
==Campus==

The campus is located in North Tacoma, Washington in a primarily residential setting a few minutes&#x27; walk from the Proctor and the Sixth Avenue district.

The campus is made up of mainly brick buildings in the Tudor-Gothic architectural style. Buildings are mostly arranged into quads. The three main quads are the North Quad and South Quad, which contain residence halls, and Karlen Quad, which contains Jones Hall, Collins Memorial Library and the Music Building. The library was designed by Tacoma architect Silas E. Nelsen in 1954. It was later renovated.

===Academic buildings===
Harned Hall, named for alumnus and local real estate developer H.C. &quot;Joe&quot; Harned, was dedicated on September 29, 2006. The building is and cost $25 million to construct. It was designed and built to meet the U.S. Green Building Council&#x27;s LEED Silver Standard. The building features labs for biology, geology, chemistry, environmental science, and physics, a courtyard with a crystalline glass gazebo in the center, a Foucault pendulum designed by Alan Thorndike, as well as Gray whale skeleton named Willy.
After Harned Hall was completed, the institution began a $38 million renovation of Thompson Hall, the &quot;old&quot; science building. Harned and Thompson Halls form a square with a courtyard in the middle, and are collectively named the Science Center. Thompson Hall has an area of and was originally constructed in 1968. The renovation was completed in spring 2008.

Wyatt Hall is the second newest academic building on campus, dedicated in 2003. It houses the English, History, Foreign Languages &amp; Literature, Politics &amp; Government, Philosophy, Honors, Science Technology &amp; Society, Classics, and Religion departments. Many of the classrooms in the building are seminar style, meaning a circle of tables that students sit at to encourage discussion between students and the professor, rather than a lecture. The building features glass art by Dale Chihuly that represents the ivy leaves covering the campus buildings.
Other buildings include McIntyre Hall, home of the School of Business and Leadership, the Departments of Economics, Sociology and Anthropology, and International Political Economy; Howarth Hall, home of the School of Education, Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Career and Employment Services, and more; Jones Hall, home of theatre arts, communication studies, and several administrative offices, including the Office of the President; and the Music Building (which is the only building on campus without a name). Kittredge Hall, the original student union building, now houses the art department and Kittredge Gallery. The Gallery is now affiliated with Tacoma Art Museum.

Collins Memorial Library houses over 400,000 books and over 130,000 periodicals, is a partial federal government repository, and has substantial microform holdings. The Library was named after former trustee Everill S. Collins. The current Library building was built in 1954. A larger addition was completed in 1974. In 2000, a major renovation brought new technology and media resources into the Library&#x27;s spaces.

Construction for the William T. and Gail T. Weyerhaeuser Center for Health Sciences began in spring 2010. At , the center provides the resources and flexibility needed to support new areas of study in the fields of health and behavioral sciences. Specially designed to encourage cross-disciplinary interaction, the center houses Puget Sound&#x27;s undergraduate departments in exercise science and psychology, graduate programs in occupational and physical therapy, and interdisciplinary program in neuroscience. Designed by Bohlin Cywinski Jackson/Seattle, Weyerhaeuser Hall conforms to the U.S. Green Building Council&#x27;s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standards.

==Academics==
The institution offers more than fifty traditional and nontraditional areas of study in the liberal arts and sciences, as well as graduate programs in occupational therapy, physical therapy, and education. It recently launched a master of public health program. The student to faculty ratio is 12 to 1.

===Rankings and reputation===
In 2012, Puget Sound was named one of forty schools nationwide in the college guide &quot;Colleges That Change Lives: 40 Schools That Will Change the Way You Think About Colleges&quot;.

The institution has ranked among the top five small liberal arts colleges for the number of graduates who participate in Peace Corps; in 2007, it ranked first.

Puget Sound professors have been named Washington State Professor of the Year seven times by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the Council for the Advancement and Support of Education.

===Admissions===
For the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), University of Puget Sound received 5,730 applications, admitted 3,060 (58.3%), and enrolled 653 students. For the freshmen who enrolled, the middle 50% range of SAT scores was 1230-1450, the ACT composite range was 27–32, and the average high school grade point average was 3.70.

===International programs===
The institution sponsors study abroad programs in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Pacific Rim, Scotland, Spain, Taiwan, and Wales.

The program in the Pacific Rim, known as PacRim, or the Pacific Rim/Asia Study-Travel Program (PRAST) is unique to Puget Sound. Every three years a group of fifteen to twenty-five students are selected to spend two semesters traveling, studying, and researching in eight Asian countries. Students must have taken three courses in the Asian studies program and completed a course of readings assigned by the director. Over the program&#x27;s 40-year history students have visited: Mongolia, People&#x27;s Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, India, Nepal, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Iran, and Yugoslavia. Previous lecturers have included: Johan Galtung, Ken Yeang, M.S. Nagaraja Rao, Jack Weatherford, the 14th Dalai Lama, Swasti Sri Charukeerthi Bhattaraka, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, Khyongla Rato Rinpoche, and Sogyal Rinpoche.

==Athletics==
Puget Sound athletics teams are nicknamed the &quot;Loggers.&quot; The teams&#x27; mascot is &quot;Grizz the Logger,&quot; a costumed student dressed as an anthropomorphic brown bear wearing stereotypical lumberjack attire and carrying a small axe. The Loggers participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III Northwest Conference, competing with George Fox University, Lewis and Clark College, Linfield College, Pacific University, Pacific Lutheran University, Whitman College, Whitworth University, and Willamette University.

===Varsity sports===
The institution offers twenty-three different varsity sports teams: Men&#x27;s Baseball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Basketball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Crew, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Cross Country, Men&#x27;s Football, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Golf, Women&#x27;s Lacrosse, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Soccer, Women&#x27;s Softball, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Swimming, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Tennis, Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Indoor and Outdoor Track &amp; Field, and Women&#x27;s Volleyball. On a minor note, former United States men&#x27;s national soccer team coach Bruce Arena got his coaching start at Puget Sound in 1976 as head of the men&#x27;s soccer team.

===Club sports===

There are both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s club soccer teams, as well as men&#x27;s club lacrosse (which competes in the Pacific Northwest Collegiate Lacrosse League). The institution also has a men&#x27;s club Ultimate team known as the &quot;Postmen,&quot; and a women&#x27;s club Ultimate team known as &quot;Clear Cut&quot;.

The institution is well known for its successful men&#x27;s rugby club. The club has achieved regional and national success over the past three seasons under coach Mark Sullivan. In 2012 the club was ranked 10th in the nation for small college rugby and traveled to Cal Maritime University in Vallejo, California for the regional tournament. The success of the men&#x27;s rugby club is attributed to the hard work of the players and continual dedication of their coaches. Also, an intense rivalry has developed between the Puget Sound rugby club and the Seattle University rugby club. Known as the Seatac Cup, Puget Sound has achieved eight straight victories over their rivals. In 2012, the victory over Seattle University clinched the Loggers&#x27; playoff spot.

The Puget Sound Loggers hockey team was founded in 2005 and is currently an ACHA division II team. The team&#x27;s most prominent victories include defeating the University of Washington Huskies in a 3-game series in the 2006-2007 season, and the Gonzaga Bulldogs in the 2007-2008 season. Loggers hockey is subsidized by ASUPS (the Associated Students of University of Puget Sound) student body and ticket sales for home games. Home games are currently played at the Sprinker Ice Arena in south Tacoma. Players come from the student body, and mostly consist of students hailing from Canada, Washington, Colorado, Minnesota, and states on the East Coast.

===Achievements===
In a football game against Linfield University on October 21, 2023, linebacker Lily Godwin became the first woman to record an unassisted tackle in the history of the NCAA. Godwin shared her tackle and her history with football in a live TV interview with King5 News.

Several sports teams have achieved some degree of success in recent years:
*The men&#x27;s basketball team won three straight Northwest Conference championships beginning in 2004, with an average .826 winning percentage over the 2004, 2005, and 2006 seasons. In 2005, the Division III Loggers defeated the Division I Highlanders of the University of California, Riverside, making it their first Division I defeat since the 1970s. In the 2009 regular season, the Loggers went an undefeated 16-0 in Northwest Conference play, becoming the first team in conference history to do so, capturing the conference title in the process.
*From 1992 to 1995 the Puget Sound women&#x27;s Cross-Country team were national champions. This tremendous 4-year run earned coach Sam Ring coach of the year honors in 1993.
*The women&#x27;s soccer team took second place in the nation in 2004 and ended the 2005 season ranked fifth nationally.
*The women&#x27;s swim team won the Northwest Conference championship for eleven consecutive years, from 1997 through 2007, before finally finishing second to Whitworth University in 2008. This remains a Northwest Conference record. The Logger women reclaimed their title in 2009.
*The women&#x27;s basketball team made the Division III Elite 8 in the 2007 season after upsetting #12 ranked McMurry University and #2 ranked Howard Payne University. They finished #10 overall.
*The women&#x27;s crew has earned a bid to compete at the Division III Rowing Championship every year since 2003. The team placed second overall in 2003 and third in 2008, as well as fourth in 2004, 2005, and 2007.

==Student life==

===Traditions and events===
Repertory Dance Group (RDG) is a non-competitive dance performance held at the end of each semester and is entirely organized, choreographed, and performed by students. RDG has been a tradition of celebrating movement and expression for dancers of any skill level for nearly 30 years. It is also the most populous student group at the institution.

In 2013 Puget Sound celebrated its 125th anniversary with a series of special events, anniversary programs, and shared memories by Loggers past and present. Celebrating the milestone of 125 years in the community, Tacoma Mayor Marilyn Strickland declared March 17, 2013, to be &quot;University of Puget Sound Day.&quot;

LogJam! is a campuswide celebration that ends the first week of fall classes. Tables are set around the perimeter of Todd Field and the Event Lawn, and clubs and teams set up to recruit potential members.

Foolish Pleasures is an annual student film festival showing films written, directed, acted, and produced by students.

====The Hatchet====
The Hatchet is the official symbol of sports teams at the University of Puget Sound. It was first discovered in 1906 when students were digging up a barn at the old campus. They decided to carve their class year into it. This became a tradition of sorts, as the seniors would hand the hatchet to the juniors on senior recognition day. This turned into a competition where each class would try to possess the hatchet for as long as possible. It disappeared for 15 years until it was anonymously mailed to former President R. Franklin Thompson. Thompson displayed it in a trophy case in Jones Hall, where it mysteriously disappeared again, only to resurface at a homecoming game in 1988. In 1998, the hatchet&#x27;s return was negotiated through an intermediary, and it was permanently displayed in a display case in the Wheelock Student Center. It was stolen in 1999 during a false fire alarm in one of the dormitories.

On September 30, 2006 (homecoming) a student rappelled into the football field at halftime, brandishing &quot;the hatchet&quot;. It was later revealed by the student newspaper &quot;The Trail&quot; that this hatchet is a replica of the actual hatchet, commissioned by the former student government administration without the knowledge of the student senate. The replica hatchet was painstakingly carved to look exactly like the original, using over 150 photos as a guide.

The original hatchet was finally returned to President Ronald Thomas in 2008 by two anonymous alumni and was displayed at Homecoming.

====Sustainability====

The campus has a notable recent history of sustainability. On February 10, 2005, President Ronald R. Thomas signed the Talloires Declaration, committing the institution to certain standards regarding sustainability. The Sustainability Advisory Committee, consisting of one faculty co-chair, one staff co-chair, and a mix of faculty, staff and student volunteers, organizes the majority of sustainability efforts on campus. These efforts have included:

*&quot;Fair trade coffee&quot;: The student-run Diversions Café serves only organically-grown, fair trade coffee. In 2005, of coffee was consumed by students, faculty, and the campus community. University of Puget Sound was the first college in the Northwest to offer fair trade coffee exclusively.
*&quot;Sustainable Move-Out&quot;: Starting in 2005, the institution organized a sustainable move-out program during finals week. Mixed-material recycling dumpsters were placed near all residence halls, allowing students to recycle rather than simply throwing all unwanted items away.
*&quot;Sustainability Mugs&quot;: Upon entering the college in 2005, all students were presented with a &quot;sustainability mug&quot; imprinted with the University of Puget Sound logo. Students were encouraged to re-use the mug to get coffee instead of using paper cups.
*&quot;No-Waste Picnic&quot;: A 2005 picnic welcoming incoming freshmen and their families to the campus produced a surprising one bag of trash for over 1700 people. This was accomplished by using recyclable paper and plastic products.

In 2007, President Thomas signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment on behalf of the institution.

===Fraternities and sororities===

The University of Puget Sound is home to three fraternities and four sororities. Puget Sound has &quot;deferred recruitment&quot;, which means that fraternities, sororities, and their members are not allowed to have intense contact with freshmen outside of class, athletics or club activities until the spring semester.

===Media===
KUPS 90.1FM (The Sound) is a student-run college radio station that began in 1968. In 2002, KUPS began streaming its standard live programming online. The radio station broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and serves the greater Tacoma area. In 2005, KUPS was named by The Princeton Review as one of the best college radio stations in the country (#12). In 2007, KUPS was ranked #9 by the Princeton Review in the Top Ten Best College Radio Stations in the Country. Most recently, in the spring of 2010, MTV honored KUPS with the national title of Best College Radio Station at the MTVu Woodie Awards. In the fall of 2011, KUPS was ranked third in a list of &quot;10 great college radio stations&quot; in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;.

&quot;The Trail&quot; is an independent student-run weekly newspaper.

&quot;Crosscurrents&quot; is the school&#x27;s literary and arts magazine and was established in 1957. Crosscurrents is published two times during the academic year, once during the Fall semester and once during the Spring semester. Magazines are free to the campus community. It is staffed by students and publishes student artwork, photography, prose, poetry, and the occasional miscellaneous piece. Crosscurrents also features a guest artist or writer in each issue- usually a notable person from the pacific northwest who is interviewed about their work.

&quot;Wetlands&quot; is a student-organized magazine focusing on sexual exploration and gender expression to encourage inclusive and open-minded conversations across the campus community. 

&quot;Elements&quot; is the school&#x27;s student-run science magazine. Published twice during the academic year, Elements primarily contains student articles about science, research, math, the environment, and technology, as well as student artwork. Copies of Elements are free and are distributed at the end of Fall semester and Spring semester.

&quot;Black Ice&quot; (or the Black Student Union Zine) is a student magazine by the focused on issues for the betterment of all students of color. The magazine is published by The Black Student Union, which was founded in 1968, making it one of the institution&#x27;s oldest clubs.

<text>Robert Michael Iler (; born March 2, 1985) is an American former actor. He is best known for his portrayal of A.J. Soprano on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. His film roles include &quot;Tadpole&quot; (2002) and &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003).

==Career==
He made his debut in 1995 as one of the children featured in the music video for &quot;Dope Hat&quot; by Marilyn Manson. By mid-1997, Iler was appearing in commercials for Pizza Hut, and attending three or four auditions a week. He had also appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and in some film parts, but nothing that brought him great recognition. It was then that he won the role of A.J. Soprano, the son of series lead Tony Soprano, on the HBO drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, which aired from 1999 until 2007. By May 2001, he had begun home schooling for his education.

After the conclusion of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; in 2007, Iler largely retired from acting, instead moving to Las Vegas to pursue a career as a professional poker player.

In July 2023, Iler started a podcast with &quot;The Sopranos&quot; co-star Jamie-Lynn Sigler called &quot;Not Today Pal&quot;, produced by the YMH studios owned by comedians Tom Segura and Christina Pazsitzky.

== Personal life ==
Iler struggled with substance abuse, particularly after &quot;The Sopranos&quot; ended. He has been sober since 2013.

In July 2001, Iler was arrested for the robbery of two teenagers in his Upper East Side neighborhood and for possession of marijuana. He pleaded guilty to a single charge of larceny and received three years&#x27; probation.

He was present on October 23, 2005, when the underground poker club Ace Point was raided by the police; however, no charges were filed against him.

<text>Sir William Vallance Douglas Hodge (; 17 June 1903 – 7 July 1975) was a British mathematician, specifically a geometer.

His discovery of far-reaching topological relations between algebraic geometry and differential geometry—an area now called Hodge theory and pertaining more generally to Kähler manifolds—has been a major influence on subsequent work in geometry.

==Life and career==
Hodge was born in Edinburgh in 1903, the younger son and second of three children of Archibald James Hodge (1869–1938), a searcher of records in the property market and a partner in the firm of Douglas and Company, and his wife, Jane (born 1875), daughter of confectionery business owner William Vallance. They lived at 1 Church Hill Place in the Morningside district.

He attended George Watson&#x27;s College, and studied at Edinburgh University, graduating MA in 1923. With help from E. T. Whittaker, whose son J. M. Whittaker was a college friend, he then enrolled as an affiliated student at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in order to study the Mathematical Tripos. At Cambridge he fell under the influence of the geometer H. F. Baker. He gained a Cambridge BA degree in 1925, receiving the MA in 1930 and the Doctor of Science (ScD) degree in 1950.

In 1926 he took up a teaching position at the University of Bristol, and began work on the interface between the Italian school of algebraic geometry, particularly problems posed by Francesco Severi, and the topological methods of Solomon Lefschetz. This made his reputation, but led to some initial scepticism on the part of Lefschetz. According to Atiyah&#x27;s memoir, Lefschetz and Hodge in 1931 had a meeting in Max Newman&#x27;s rooms in Cambridge, to try to resolve issues. In the end Lefschetz was convinced.
In 1928 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Ralph Allan Sampson, Charles Glover Barkla, and Sir Charles Galton Darwin. He was awarded the Society&#x27;s Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize for the period 1964 to 1968.

In 1930 Hodge was awarded a Research Fellowship at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He spent the year 1931–2 at Princeton University, where Lefschetz was, visiting also Oscar Zariski at Johns Hopkins University. At this time he was also assimilating de Rham&#x27;s theorem, and defining the Hodge star operation. It would allow him to define harmonic forms and so refine the de Rham theory.

On his return to Cambridge, he was offered a University Lecturer position in 1933. He became the Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry at Cambridge, a position he held from 1936 to 1970. He was the first head of DPMMS.

He was the Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge from 1958 to 1970, and vice-president of the Royal Society from 1959 to 1965. He was knighted in 1959. Amongst other honours, he received the Adams Prize in 1937 and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1974.

He died in Cambridge on 7 July 1975.

==Work==
The Hodge index theorem was a result on the intersection number theory for curves on an algebraic surface: it determines the signature of the corresponding quadratic form. This result was sought by the Italian school of algebraic geometry, but was proved by the topological methods of Lefschetz.

&quot;The Theory and Applications of Harmonic Integrals&quot; summed up Hodge&#x27;s development during the 1930s of his general theory. This starts with the existence for any Kähler metric of a theory of Laplacians – it applies to an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; (assumed complex, projective and non-singular) because projective space itself carries such a metric. In de Rham cohomology terms, a cohomology class of degree &quot;k&quot; is represented by a &quot;k&quot;-form &quot;α&quot; on &quot;V&quot;(C). There is no unique representative; but by introducing the idea of &quot;harmonic form&quot; (Hodge still called them &#x27;integrals&#x27;), which are solutions of Laplace&#x27;s equation, one can get unique &quot;α&quot;. This has the important, immediate consequence of splitting up

:&quot;H&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;V&quot;(C), C)

into subspaces

:&quot;H&quot;&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;

according to the number &quot;p&quot; of holomorphic differentials &quot;dzi&quot; wedged to make up &quot;α&quot; (the cotangent space being spanned by the &quot;dzi&quot; and their complex conjugates). The dimensions of the subspaces are the Hodge numbers.

This &quot;Hodge decomposition&quot; has become a fundamental tool. Not only do the dimensions h&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot; refine the Betti numbers, by breaking them into parts with identifiable geometric meaning; but the decomposition itself, as a varying &#x27;flag&#x27; in a complex vector space, has a meaning in relation with moduli problems. In broad terms, Hodge theory contributes both to the discrete and the continuous classification of algebraic varieties.

Further developments by others led in particular to an idea of mixed Hodge structure on singular varieties, and to deep analogies with étale cohomology.

==Hodge conjecture==

The Hodge conjecture on the &#x27;middle&#x27; spaces H&quot;p&quot;,&quot;p&quot; is still unsolved, in general. It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems set up by the Clay Mathematics Institute.

==Exposition==
Hodge also wrote, with Daniel Pedoe, a three-volume work &quot;Methods of Algebraic Geometry&quot;, on classical algebraic geometry, with much concrete content – illustrating though what Élie Cartan called &#x27;the debauch of indices&#x27; in its component notation. According to Atiyah, this was intended to update and replace H. F. Baker&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geometry&quot;.

==Family==
In 1929 he married Kathleen Anne Cameron.

<text>Eastern Washington University (EWU) is a public university in Cheney, Washington, United States. It shares its satellite campus in Spokane, Washington with Washington State University. 

Founded in 1882, the university is academically divided into four colleges: the College of Arts, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences; the College of Health Science &amp; Public Health; the College of Professional Programs; and the College of Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics.

==History==
The city of Cheney, then known as Depot Springs, was surveyed in 1880 along the tracks of the Northern Pacific Railroad; expressman Benjamin Pierce Cheney was a member of that railroad&#x27;s board of directors. Officials renamed the city for Cheney by October 1880, prompting him to donate $10,000 to establish the Benjamin P. Cheney Academy in 1882 on an site at present-day Showalter Hall. At the time, the school was a private institution losing pupils to the competing public school district; after Washington was admitted to the union in 1889, the Enabling Act allowed the establishment of normal schools in the new state and in 1890 the school was renamed the State Normal School at Cheney to train future elementary school teachers. The first class of teachers began their studies on October 13, 1890, under the administration of W. W. Gillette (principal) and William J. Sutton (vice principal).
The campus was almost totally destroyed twice by fire in 1891 and 1912, but was rebuilt each time. On August 27, 1891, while the original 1882 Cheney Academy building was being expanded, the first fire destroyed the building and unfinished addition, and classes were moved to the Pomeroy building in downtown Cheney temporarily. Sutton took over as principal in 1892 and spearheaded an appropriation of $60,000 in 1895 from the state for a new building, completed in 1896 at the site of the former Academy building. Sutton resigned in 1897, and shortly afterward, Governor John R. Rogers vetoed funding for the fledgling school, forcing it to cancel classes for the 1897–98 school year. Locals provided enough funding to operate the school in 1898, and state funding resumed in 1899.

Noah D. Showalter was elected president of the Normal School in 1911, just before the second fire destroyed the 1896 building on April 24, 1912. Like Sutton before him, Showalter urged the state to pass an appropriation of $300,000 to pay for a new building; after Governor Ernest Lister vetoed the appropriation, the veto was overridden by the legislature under the leadership of Sutton, then serving as a State Senator.

Julius Zittel was selected to design the new administration building, which was dedicated on May 22, 1915, and later renamed to Showalter Hall in 1940. The Herculean Pillars, at the intersection of 5th and College, were also completed in 1915, using materials salvaged from the 1896 Normal School building, and served as the entrance to the school for those arriving from the downtown train station.

Cheney Normal School continued to grow, opening its first dormitories in 1916 (Monroe Hall), 1920 (Senior Hall), and 1923 (Sutton Hall); in 1929, it completed the President&#x27;s House (now University House), to serve as the residence for the school&#x27;s president. All were designed by Zittel. A new building to house the Training School for future teachers was opened in 1937 and named Martin Hall to honor Governor and local resident Clarence Martin. That same year, Cheney Normal School was renamed to Eastern Washington College of Education. On June 4, 1940, the new campus library was opened as Hargreaves Hall (designed by Rasque), and the former administration building was formally dedicated to Noah Showalter.
The school grew quickly following World War II and became Eastern Washington State College in 1961. During this era, Eastern added various graduate and undergraduate degree programs. In 1977, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Eastern Washington University by the Washington State Legislature.

In 1992, the core of the campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In July 2024, amid a continuing drop in enrollment and inability to differentiate itself with the other regional universities in Washington (Western Washington University and Central Washington University), university president Shari McMahan announced that EWU would rebrand to a polytechnic university, emphasizing applied and experiential learning over theoretical discussions. The change drew criticism from students and faculty in the humanities, fearing that arts-related programs would be reduced or overlooked in the change. The university plans to expand internship opportunities and work with employers to offer more degrees for in-demand fields.

==Campus locations==
The main campus of Eastern Washington University is located in Cheney. A branch campus, known as the Riverpoint Campus is located nearby in Spokane and is shared with Washington State University.

EWU also offers degree programs located in Bellevue, Everett, Seattle, Longview, and Vancouver (Washington).

==Academics==

EWU offers over 100 fields of study, 10 master&#x27;s degrees, seven graduate certificates, 55 graduate programs of study and an applied doctoral program of physical therapy. A master&#x27;s in social work is offered in Everett and Vancouver, and a master&#x27;s in education is available in Kent. A creative writing Master of Fine Arts, Interdisciplinary Studies, Child &amp; Family Outreach Program, Communication Studies, Social Work Program (part-time Master&#x27;s), Journalism, Alcohol &amp; Drug Studies, and Counseling Education &amp; Developmental Psychology programs are offered in Spokane.

===Admissions===
The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching classifies the university as &quot;Inclusive&quot;, since the university admitted eighty-two percent of those who applied to be freshmen in 2010. The average incoming freshman had a combined SAT score of 970 and a high-school weighted grade-point average (GPA) of 3.17 in 2010. 86% of freshmen in 2010 were from Washington.

===Rankings===

===Research institutes &amp; centers===
Eastern Washington University is home to a number of research institutes and centers, including:

*Institute for Public Policy &amp; Economic Analysis—created in 2002 to &quot;provide data and analysis about a variety of factors in the region that will be useful for businesses, communities and others as they plan for the future.&quot;
*Women&#x27;s and Gender Education Center—The Women’s and Gender Education (WAGE) Center supports the Gender, Women’s &amp; Sexuality Studies (GWSS) program’s efforts in offering students the skills to critically and actively engage with the world.
*Eisenhower Center/International Field Study—A program designed for students to travel abroad while earning college credit.
*English Language Institute—ELI.
*Center for Farm Health &amp; Safety—Conducts research and demonstration programs involving Health and Safety of Farm-based population groups.
*Fisheries Research Center— Performs a great variety of salmonid restoration studies including but not limited to: diet studies, population modeling, telemetry, bone regressions, bioenergetic modeling, water quality assessment, ecosystem modeling, surgical implantation of radio, acoustic and ultrasonic tags, and tributary sampling.

==Student life==
===Pence Union Building (PUB)===
The Pence Union Building, or PUB, is the community center for Eastern Washington University.

=== University Recreation Center (URC) ===
The University Recreation Center (URC) is a three-level recreational facility that was opened on campus in 2008. The facility has a multi-purpose arena that can operate as an ice rink and general-purpose sports floor, indoor climbing wall with 11 routes (one simulating ice climbing) and two bouldering walls, an indoor parking garage, fitness center and gymnasium, campus dining facility known as &quot;The Roost&quot; and a two-Lane 200-meter running track.

===&quot;The Easterner&quot;===
&quot;The Easterner&quot; is the student newspaper of Eastern Washington University. The paper is distributed in print form during the fall, winter, and spring quarters on a weekly basis. &quot;The Easterner&quot; maintains a website and Facebook page, both independent from the university. The first student newspaper, &quot;The State Normal School Journal&quot;, was first in 1916. The weekly publication changed its name to &quot;The Easterner&quot; in 1951.

===Student organizations and Greek life===
The student body&#x27;s government, the Associated Students of Eastern Washington University, dates to 1919–1920, and organizes the work of a wide range of student committees. The Office of Student Activities oversees more than 100 student clubs and organizations on campus that cater to a wide variety of interests and activities. EWU is the only regional university in Washington that has an active Greek system on campus.

==Athletics==
Eastern Washington University offers club, intramural, and varsity sports. Its twelve varsity men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports teams compete in the Big Sky Conference of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division I as the Eastern Washington Eagles. The most-prominent athletics facilities on campus are Roos Field, Reese Court and the Jim Thorpe Fieldhouse. EWU has three national championships, including football (2010 – NCAA Div. I FCS), wrestling (1977 – NAIA) and men&#x27;s cross country (1982 – NCAA Div. II).

FIRST Robotics Competition events have been held there, including the Pacific Northwest District regional, since 2014. The venue has since been switched to the Veterans Memorial Coliseum (Portland, Oregon).

<text>The year 1959 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy and space exploration==
* January 2 – Soviet spacecraft &quot;Luna 1&quot; is launched by a Vostok rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome; the first man-made object to attain escape velocity, it is intended to impact Earth&#x27;s Moon, but an error causes it instead to become the first spacecraft to fly by the Moon and the first man-made object to enter heliocentric orbit.
* February 6 – At Cape Canaveral, Florida, the first successful test firing of a Titan intercontinental ballistic missile is accomplished.
* February 17 – Vanguard 2, the first weather satellite, is launched to measure cloud cover for the United States Navy.
* March 3 – Lunar probe Pioneer 4 becomes the first American object to escape dominance by Earth&#x27;s gravity.
* April 9 – NASA announces its selection of seven military pilots to become the first United States astronauts, later known as the &#x27;Mercury Seven&#x27;.
* May 28 – Jupiter AM-18 rocket launches two primates, Miss Baker and Miss Able, into space from Cape Canaveral in the United States along with living microorganisms and plant seeds. Successful recovery makes them the first living beings to return safely to Earth after space flight.
* June 25 – A KH-1 Corona satellite, believed to be the first operational spy satellite, is launched as science mission &quot;Discoverer 4&quot; from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, aboard a Thor-Agena rocket.
* July 7 – At 14:28 UT Venus occults the star Regulus. The rare event (which will next occur on October 1, 2044) is used to determine the diameter of Venus and the structure of Venus&#x27; atmosphere.
* August 7 – The United States launches the Explorer 6 satellite from the Atlantic Missile Range in Cape Canaveral.
* August 14 – Explorer 6 sends the first picture of Earth from orbit.
* September 14 – Soviet spacecraft &quot;Luna 2&quot; becomes the first man-made object to crash on Earth&#x27;s Moon.
* September 19 – Giuseppe Cocconi and Philip Morrison establish the scientific rationale for SETI with the publishing of their seminal paper &quot;Searching for Interstellar Communications&quot; in &quot;Nature&quot;.
* October 7 – Russian probe &quot;Luna 3&quot; sends back the first images of the far side of Earth&#x27;s Moon.
* October 13 – The United States launches Explorer 7.
* November 24 – Yardymli meteorite makes a landfall in Azerbaijan.
* December 4 – Little Joe 2, a mission in the Mercury program, carries Sam, a rhesus macaque monkey, close to the edge of space.
* Coma Berenicids discovered.
* First successful test of a nuclear thermal rocket engine, as part of Project Rover at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States under Raemer Schreiber.

==Biology==
* January 1 – Cultivars of plants named after this date must be named in a modern language, not in Latin.
* March 26 – Jersey Zoo (later Durrell Wildlife Park) established by Gerald Durrell.
* August 8 – Min Chueh Chang reports the first mammals, a litter of rabbits, grown from ova having undergone &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilisation and transferred to a surrogate mother.
*The term &quot;pheromone&quot; is coined.
*Pierre-Paul Grassé invents the theory of stigmergy to explain the behavior of nest building in termites.

* October – Martin Gardner presents the Three Prisoners problem in probability theory.
* Edsger W. Dijkstra rediscovers &#x27;Prim&#x27;s algorithm&#x27;.
* Kenkichi Iwasawa initiates Iwasawa theory.

==Medicine==
* July – The medical research group studying Minamata disease comes to the conclusion that mercury is the cause.
* Joseph Murray performs the world&#x27;s first successful allotransplantation.
* Georges Mathé, a French oncologist, performs the first bone marrow transplant on five Yugoslavian nuclear workers whose own marrow has been damaged by intense irradiation caused by a criticality accident at the Vinča Nuclear Institute, but all of these transplants are rejected.
* First known case of human HIV, in the Belgian Congo.

==Paleontology==
* July 17 – &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot; (originally designated &quot;Zinjanthropus&quot;) is found in the Olduvai Gorge of Tanganyika by Mary and Louis Leakey, dating from between 2.6 and 1.1 million years BP.
* First femur of Arlington Springs Man is found on Santa Rosa Island, California, by Phil C. Orr. The remains are subsequently dated to 13,000 years BP, making them potentially the oldest known human remains in North America.

<text>Mary Ashton Livermore ( Rice; December 19, 1820May 23, 1905) was an American journalist, abolitionist, and advocate of women&#x27;s rights. Her printed volumes included: &quot;Thirty Years Too Late,&quot; first published in 1847 as a prize temperance tale, and republished in 1878; &quot;Pen Pictures; or, Sketches from Domestic Life&quot;; &quot;What Shall We Do with Our Daughters? Superfluous Women, and Other Lectures&quot;; and &quot;My Story of the War. A Woman&#x27;s Narrative of Four Years&#x27; Personal Experience as Nurse in the Union Army, and in Relief Work at Home, in Hospitals, Camps and at the Front during the War of the Rebellion&quot;. She wrote a sketch of the sculptor Anne Whitney for &quot;Women of the Day&quot; and delivered the historical address for the Centennial Celebration of the First Settlement of the Northwestern States in Marietta, Ohio on July 15, 1788.

When the American Civil War broke out, Livermore became connected with the United States Sanitary Commission, headquarters at Chicago and performed a vast amount of labor of all kinds by organizing auxiliary societies, visiting hospitals and military posts, contributing to the press, answering correspondence, and other things incident to the work done by that institution. She was one of those that helped organize the great fair in 1863, at Chicago, when nearly $100,000 was raised and for which she obtained the original draft of the Emancipation Proclamation from President Lincoln, which was sold for $3,000, and funded the building of the Soldiers&#x27; Home. 

When the war was over, she instituted a pro-women&#x27;s suffrage paper called the &quot;Agitator&quot;, which was afterwards merged in the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;. Of that she was an editor for two years and a frequent contributor thereafter. On the lecture platform, she had a remarkable career, speaking mostly on behalf of women&#x27;s suffrage and temperance movements. For many years, she traveled annually and spoke five nights each week for five months of the year.

==Early years and education==
Mary Ashton Rice was born in Boston, Massachusetts on December 19, 1820, to Timothy Rice and Zebiah Vose (Ashton) Rice. 

A direct descendant of Edmund Rice, an early Puritan immigrant to Massachusetts Bay Colony. she came from a military family. Her father fought in the War of 1812 and her mother was a descendant of Captain Nathaniel Ashton of London. Livermore was incredibly intelligent, graduating from Boston public schools at age 14. As there were no public high school or college options for women of that time, she attended school at an all-female seminary in Charlestown, Massachusetts, graduating in 1838. As her family was extremely religious, she read the entire Bible every year until the age of 23.

==Career==
After graduating from the seminary in 1836, she stayed there as a teacher for two years. In 1839, she started a job as a tutor on a Virginia plantation, and after witnessing the cruel institution of slavery, she became an abolitionist. She also began work with the temperance movement at this time, identified with the Washington Temperance Reform and was an editor for a juvenile temperance paper. In 1842, she left the plantation to take charge of a private school in Duxbury, Massachusetts, where she worked for three years. She also taught at Charlestown, Massachusetts.

She married Daniel P. Livermore, a Universalist minister in May 1845, and in 1857, they moved to Chicago. In that year, her husband established the &quot;New Covenant&quot;, a Universalist journal of which she became associate editor for twelve years, during which time she frequently contributed to periodicals of her denomination and edited the &quot;Lily&quot;.

As a member of the Republican party, Livermore campaigned for Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election. In the Chicago Wigwam in 1860, Livermore was the only woman reporter assigned a location for work amidst hundreds of male reporters. She published a collection of nineteen essays entitled &quot;Pen Pictures&quot; in 1863.

===American Civil War===
During the Civil War, she volunteered as an associate member of the United States Sanitary Commission at 40 years old. As an agent of its Chicago branch, later named the Northwestern branch, she attended a council of the National Sanitary Commission at Washington in December 1862, organized many aid societies, visited army posts and hospitals, and in 1863, organized the North-western Sanitary Fair in Chicago which raised $86,000. President Lincoln donated his own copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, which was auctioned off at $10,000. Livermore eventually became the co-director of the Chicago branch with Jane Hoge, another soldier&#x27;s aid advocate. The two women completed a hospital inspection tour across Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri. With a thorough understanding of the needs of the hospitals, Hoge and Livermore sent $1 million worth of food and supplies to hospitals and battlefields most in need.

Livermore, like many other nurses, came up against the issue of women disguised as male soldiers. On a visit to the camp of the 19th Illinois Infantry, a captain pointed out a soldier to Livermore, asking if she noticed anything odd about them. Livermore confirmed the captain&#x27;s suspicions that the soldier was indeed a woman. The captain called the soldier for questioning, and though she pleaded to stay in service near her beloved, Livermore escorted her out of camp. The soldier escaped Livermore, however, and fled.

In addition to her nursing services, Livermore was also a prolific writer. She authored numerous books of poetry, essays, and stories, and was a recognized member of the literary guild. Though Livermore had to sacrifice much of her social justice work for nursing, she still managed to publish some kind of content once a week throughout the entirety of the war. She summarized her experience in her 1887 book, &quot;My Story of the War. A Woman&#x27;s Narrative of Four Years&#x27; Personal Experience as Nurse in the Union Army, and in Relief Work at Home, in Hospitals, Camps and at the Front during the War of the Rebellion.&quot;

==Suffrage and temperance activities==

After the war, Livermore devoted herself to the promotion of women&#x27;s suffrage (along with Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe ) and the temperance movement. In 1868, she co-founded the Chicago Sorosis Club with Myra Bradwell and Kate Doggett. This was the first women&#x27;s group in Chicago to advocate for woman suffrage. That same year, the group organized the first woman suffrage convention in Chicago.

In 1869, the year that women suffragists in the Equal Rights Association spilt over the issue of voting rights for African American men, Livermore sided with Lucy Stone and those founding the American Woman Suffrage Association. That same year, she founded and edited a suffragist journal called &quot;The Agitator&quot;, which was &quot;devoted to the interests of women.&quot; She published 37 issues of the journal that year. In 1870, the Livermores moved to Boston, and Mary began to be active in suffrage activities there. &quot;The Agitator&quot; was merged into the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, the well-known suffrage journal founded by Lucy Stone, and Livermore became associate editor. She served in that role for two years.

Joining with Stone, Henry Blackwell and Julia Ward Howe, Livermore helped found the Massachusetts Women&#x27;s Suffrage Association. She became president of the American Woman Suffrage Association. She was also the first president of the Association for the Advancement of Women.

==Spiritualism==
Livermore was interested in spiritualism, which grew in popularity after the Civil War, especially among Unitarians. After her husband died in 1899, she believed she was able to continue to communicate with him through a medium.

==Death and legacy==
Livermore died in Melrose, Massachusetts, on May 23, 1905.

The Mary A. Livermore School in Melrose, operational from 1891 to 1933, was an elementary school named for her. In 1943, nearly four decades after her death, she became the namesake of a World War II Liberty ship, the SS &quot;Mary A. Livermore&quot;.

<text>The president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (, , Lingala: &quot;Mokonzi wa Republíki ya Kongó Demokratíki&quot;) is the head of state of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

The position of president in the DRC has existed since the first constitution – known as The Fundamental Law – of 1960. However the powers of this position have varied over the years, from a limited shared role in the executive branch, with a prime minister, to a full-blown dictatorship. Under the current constitution, the President exists as the highest institution in a semi-presidential republic. The president is protected by the Republican Guard. The constitutional mandate of the then president, Joseph Kabila, was due to expire on 20 December 2016 but was initially extended by him until the end of 2017 and he continued to remain in post until a presidential election was held in December 2018 when Félix Tshisekedi was elected and took office on 24 January 2019.

==Presidential powers==

The semi-presidential system established by the constitution is largely borrowed from the French constitution. Although it is the prime minister and parliament that oversee much of the nation&#x27;s actual lawmaking, the president wields significant influence, both formally and from constitutional convention. The president holds the nation&#x27;s most senior office, and outranks all other politicians.

The president is able to choose the prime minister. However, the President must nominate the prime minister from among the parliamentary majority after consultation with the parliamentary majority, if an obvious majority exists, and if it does not exist, must nominate a prime minister who has a once renewable 30 day exploratory mandate to form a coalition. The prime minister and cabinet must present their plan of action to the National Assembly, which must approve the government and the plan of action by an absolute majority. Only the National Assembly has the power to dismiss the prime minister&#x27;s government.
*When the majority of the Assembly has opposite political views to that of the president, this leads to political cohabitation. In that case, the president&#x27;s power is diminished, since much of the de facto power relies on a supportive prime minister and National Assembly, and is not directly attributed to the post of president. Still, the constitutional convention is that the president directs foreign policy, though he must work on that matter with the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
*When the majority of the Assembly sides with him, the President can take a more active role and may, in effect, direct government policy. The prime minister is often a mere &quot;fuse&quot;and can be replaced if the administration becomes unpopular.

Among the formal powers of the president:

*The president ensures respect of the constitution and ensures the proper functioning of the public authorities and institutions as well as the continuity of the State. He guarantees the independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of the nation and ensures the observance of international treaties.
*The president appoints the Prime Minister and, acting on the advice of the latter, appoints and removes the other members of the government.
*The president convokes and presides at meetings of the Council of Ministers, promulgates the laws, and issues ordinances
*The president invests the elected Governors and Vice-Governors of the Provinces with their powers.
*The president appoints, suspends, and removes, on the proposal of the government and after deliberation by the Council of Ministers:
**Ambassadors and other diplomatic personnel;
**Officers of the armed forces and national police, after hearing the opinion of the High Defense Council;
**The general chief of staff, the chiefs of staff and the commanders of the main branches of the armed forces, after hearing the opinion of the High Defense Council;
**High-ranking civil servants;
**Persons in charge of public services and establishments;
**Representatives of the State (other than auditors) in public enterprises;
**Judges and public prosecutors on the proposal of the High Council of the Judiciary.
*The president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and chairs the High Defense Council.
*The president confers national honors.
*The president may declare a state of emergency or a state of siege &quot;When grave circumstances constitute a present threat to the independence or the integrity of the national territory or when they provoke the disruption of the proper functioning of the institutions.&quot;
*The president may declare war with the authorization of both chambers of parliament, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, and after hearing the opinion of the High Defense Council.
*The President may grant pardons or commute or reduce sentences.
*The President appoints and accredits ambassadors to foreign countries and international organizations, and receives ambassadors accredited to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
*The President defines national policy in coordination with the government and is responsible, in cooperation with the government, for defense, security, and foreign affairs.
*The president has a very limited form of suspensive veto: when presented with a law. The president can request another reading of it by parliament, but only once per law.

==Requirements==
Article 72 of the Congolese constitution states that the President must be a natural-born citizen – or more accurately: – of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and at least 30 years of age. Additionally, the President must be free of any legal constraints on their civil and political rights.

Article 10 of the same constitution defines &quot;citoyen d&#x27;origine&quot; as : &quot;anyone belonging to the ethnic groups whose persons and territory constituted what became the Congo (currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo), at independence&quot;.

==Succession==

Articles 75 and 76 of the constitution state that upon the death or resignation of the President, the vacancy of the position is declared by the Constitutional court. The President of the Senate then becomes interim president.

The Independent Electoral Commission has to organize elections between sixty (60) and ninety (90) days after the official declaration of vacancy by the Constitutional court.

==Other information==

The official office of the president is the &quot;Palais de la Nation&quot; (Palace of the Nation) in Kinshasa.The official residence of the president is the &quot;Camp Tshatshi Palace&quot; in Kinshasa, although it has not been used since it was looted in 1997. Other presidential residences include:
* the &quot;Palais de Marbre&quot;; it houses foreign official guests;
* the &quot;Domaine de la Rwindi&quot; in Goma, Nord-Kivu.

==Elections==
Under the 2006 constitution, the President is directly elected to a five-year term – renewable only once – by universal suffrage. The first President to have been elected under these provisions is Joseph Kabila, in the 2006 elections.

After the president is elected, he goes through a solemn investiture ceremony.

===2023 election===

<doc id="384443" wikidata="Q1414052" url="?curid=384443" title="Roussanne">
<text>Roussanne () is a white wine grape grown originally in the Rhône wine region in France, where it is often blended with Marsanne. It is the only other white variety, besides Marsanne, allowed in the northern Rhône appellations of Crozes-Hermitage AOC, Hermitage AOC and Saint-Joseph AOC. In the southern Rhône appellation of Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC it is one of six white grapes allowed, where it may be blended into red wines. Roussanne is also planted in various wine-growing regions of the New World, such as California, Washington, Texas, South Africa and Australia as well as European regions such as Crete, Tuscany and Spain.

The berries are distinguished by their russet color when ripe—&quot;roux&quot; is French for the reddish-brown color &quot;russet&quot;, and is probably the root for the variety&#x27;s name. The aroma of Roussanne is often reminiscent of a flowery herbal tea. In warm climates, it produces wines of richness, with flavors of honey and pear, and full body. In cooler climates it is more floral and more delicate, with higher acidity. In many regions, it is a difficult variety to grow, with vulnerability to mildew, poor resistance to drought and wind, late and/or uneven ripening, and irregular yields.

==Viticulture and winemaking==
The Roussanne vine ripens late and is characterized by its irregular yields that can decrease further due to poor wind resistance. The vine is also susceptible to powdery mildew and rot which makes it a difficult vine to cultivate. In recent years, the development of better clones has alleviated some of these difficulties. The grape prefers a long growing season but should be harvested before the potential alcohol reaches 14% which would result in the finished wine being out of balance. If picked too soon, the grape can suffer from high acidity. During winemaking, Roussanne is prone to oxidation without care being taken by the winemaker. The wine can benefit from a controlled use of oak. In blends, Roussanne adds aromatics, elegance and acidity with the potential to age and further develop in the bottle.

==Wine regions==

It is likely that Roussanne originated in the northern Rhône where it is today an important component in the wines of Crozes-Hermitage, Hermitage, Saint-Joseph and the Saint-Péray AOC where it is used for both still and sparkling wine production. In recent years plantings of Roussanne have declined as Marsanne gains more of a foothold in the northern Rhône due to its high productivity and ease of cultivation. In the southern Rhône, Roussanne is a primary component in the white wines of Châteauneuf-du-Pape where it can comprise as much as 80–100% of the wine. It can also be found in some white wines from the Côtes du Rhône AOC. Outside of the Rhône, the Roussanne is grown in Provence and the Languedoc-Roussillon région where it is sometimes blended with Chardonnay, Marsanne and Vermentino in some &quot;vin de pays&quot;. In Savoie, the grape is known as Bergeron where it produces highly aromatic wines in Chignin.

Outside France it is grown in the Italian wine regions of Liguria and Tuscany where it is a permitted grape in Montecarlo bianco. In Australia, it was believed to have been brought to the continent to be blended with Shiraz. Documents dating as far back as 1882 have noted the presence of Roussanne plantings in Victoria. Today it is used both as a blending grape and as a varietal wine. In California, it is widely planted in the Central Coast AVA and the northern region of Yuba County. It has also recently been grown in the northern Golan Heights and produced as a wine in Israel. Along with other Rhône varieties, it is increasingly grown in South Africa.
In Washington State, the first experimental plantings of Roussanne were planted by White Heron Cellars in 1990. In recent years, plantings have increased as more Washington winemakers experiment with Rhone varietals with grapes from Ciel du Cheval, Alder Ridge and Destiny Ridge. Washington Roussanne is often blended with Viognier and is characterized by its fruit salad profile of notes that range from apple, lime, peach and citrus to cream and honey. The Texas High Plains is proving to be well suited for growing high quality Roussanne. In New Jersey, Unionville Vineyards grows Roussanne, Marsanne, and other Rhone varieties.

==California Roussanne/Viognier controversy==
In the 1980s, California winemaker Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon Vineyard smuggled cuttings of Roussanne that he reportedly got from a vineyard in Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Under California regulations, vines from outside the state are quarantined for a lengthy period which includes inspection for grape diseases and ampelographical identification at University of California, Davis. Grahm imported his cuttings in his suitcase and planted them at his vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains where he began making a Rhone style blend with Marsanne. In 1994, Grahm sold some of his Roussanne cuttings to Sonoma Grapevine, one of the largest nurseries in the state, who began to propagate the vines and sell them to wineries and other nurseries which spread these Roussanne vines across the state. One of the wineries that bought these cuttings was the California cult winery, Caymus Vineyards, who planted them in their Monterey vineyards. In 1998, John Alban of Alban Vineyards was visiting Caymus and noted that the Roussanne plantings looked more like Viognier than Roussanne. Samples were sent for DNA analysis and the result proved that the plantings were indeed Viognier as were all the vines that came from Grahm&#x27;s original &quot;Roussanne&quot; vineyard.

==Wines==

Wines made from Roussanne are characterized by their intense aromatics which can include notes of herbal tea. In its youth it shows more floral, herbal and fruit notes, such as pear, which become more nutty as the wine ages. Roussanne from the Savoie region is marked by pepper and herbal notes. Wine expert Oz Clarke notes that Roussanne wine and Roussanne dominated blends can drink very well in the first 3 to 4 years of their youth before entering a &quot;dumb phase&quot; where the wine is closed aromatically until the wine reaches 7 or 8 years when it develops more complexity and depth.

==Synonyms and relationship to other grapes==
Synonyms include Barbin, Bergeron (in particular in the Savoie region), Courtoisie, Fromental, Fromental jaune, Fromenteal, Fromenteau, Greffon, Greffou, Martin Cot, Petite Rousette, Picotin blanc, Plant de Seyssel, Rabellot, Rabelot, Ramoulette, Rebellot, Rebolot, Remoulette, Roussane, Roussane blanc, Roussanne blanc, Roussette, Rusan Belyi, Rusan Blan.

There are similarly named grapes that are unrelated to Roussanne—most notably the pink-skinned Roussanne du Var grown in Provence and the Roussette found in Savoie, which is also known as Altesse.

<doc id="384453" wikidata="Q118422" url="?curid=384453" title="Gaius Julius Priscus">
<text>Gaius Julius Priscus (fl. 3rd century) was a Roman soldier and member of the Praetorian Guard in the reign of Gordian III.

==Life==
Priscus was born in the Roman province of Syria, possibly in Damascus, son of a Julius Marinus, a local Roman citizen, possibly of some importance. The name of his mother is unknown, but his brother was Marcus Julius Philippus, later the Roman Emperor known as &quot;Philip the Arab&quot;. 

Priscus was probably older than Philip, since the latter&#x27;s political career was pushed by the former&#x27;s own influence. According to several inscriptions, Priscus was Praefectus of the province of Mesopotamia a frontier province at the border of Persia, therefore highly militarized. He was the Procurator of Macedonia, second in command to Egypt&#x27;s governor and held judicial responsibilities in Alexandria. Priscus became a member of the Praetorian Guard around 242 during Gordian III Persian campaign, and, when Timesitheus – the praetorian prefect – died in 243, he convinced the young emperor to substitute him with his own brother Philip. For a year, Priscus and Philip served as &quot;de facto&quot; regents of Gordian III. 

After Gordian&#x27;s death in 244, Priscus&#x27;s brother Philippus became the new emperor. As his brother and trusted ally, Priscus remained in the East, while Philip travelled to Rome. Priscus held supreme power in the Eastern provinces and was referred to in inscriptions as &quot;Rector Orientis&quot;. His rule was severe and oppressive. Following his brother&#x27;s directives, Priscus collected heavy taxes that eventually led to rebellion and the uprising of Jotapianus, one of the four usurpers reported for Philip&#x27;s reign. Apparently, Priscus managed to control this rebellion. Nothing is known on Priscus after the outbreak of Jotapianus&#x27; revolt and the facts surrounding his death are lost to history.</text><links>

<doc id="384457" wikidata="Q3007243" url="?curid=384457" title="Culture of Angola">
<text>The culture of [[Angola]] is influenced by the Portuguese. Portugal occupied the coastal enclave Luanda, and later also Benguela, since the 16th/17th centuries, and expanded into the territory of what is now Angola in the 19th/20th centuries, ruling it until 1975. Both countries share prevailing cultural aspects: the Portuguese language and Roman Catholicism. However, present-day Angolan culture is mostly native Bantu, which was mixed with Portuguese culture. The diverse ethnic communities with their own cultural traits, traditions and native languages or dialects include the Ovimbundu, Ambundu, Bakongo, Chokwe, Avambo and other peoples.

==Ethnic groups and languages==
There are over 100 distinct ethnic groups and languages/dialects in Angola. Although Portuguese is the official language, for many black Angolans it is a second or even third language. The three dominant ethnic groups are the Ovimbundu, Mbundu (better called Ambundu, speaking Kimbundu) and the Bakongo. There are also small numbers of Mestiço (mixed African and European descent) and ethnic white Europeans as well.

===Ovimbundu===
The largest ethnolinguistic category, the Ovimbundu, were located in west-central Angola, south of Mbundu-inhabited regions. In 1988 the United States Department of State estimated that they constituted 37 percent of the population. The language of the Ovimbundu is Umbundu.

The core area of the Ovimbundu kingdoms was that part of the Benguela Plateau north of the town of Huambo. Expansion continuing into the twentieth century enlarged their territory considerably, although most Ovimbundu remained in that part of the plateau above 1,200 meters in elevation.

Like most African groups of any size, the Ovimbundu were formed by the mixture of groups of diverse origin (and varying size). Little is known of developments before the seventeenth century, but there is some evidence of additions to the people who occupied the Benguela Plateau at that time. Over time, a number of political entities, usually referred to as kingdoms, were formed. By the eighteenth century, there were twenty-two kingdoms. Thirteen were fully independent; the other nine were largely autonomous but owed tribute to one of the more powerful entities, usually the kingdom of Bailundu, but in some cases Wambu or Ciyaka. By the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century, effective occupation by the Portuguese had caused a fairly rapid decline in the power of the heads of these kingdoms, but Ovimbundu continued to think of themselves as members of one or another of the groups based on these political units after World War II.

In addition, to the groups that clearly spoke dialects of Umbundu, there were two on the periphery of Ovimbundu distribution: the Mbui, who seemed to straddle the linguistic boundary between the Ovimbundu and the Mbundu; and the Dombe living to the west near the coast, whose language was closely related to Umbundu, although not a dialect of it. The Dombe and several other groups, including the Nganda and the Hanya (who, according to one account, spoke Umbundu dialects) relied on cattle raising, as did their southern neighbors, the Herero and the Ovambo. Still others, typically the old tributary kingdoms, came to speak Umbundu relatively recently.

Until the Portuguese established firm control over their territory, the Ovimbundu – particularly those of the major kingdoms of Bailundu (to the northwest), Bihe (to the northeast), and Wambu (in the center) – played important roles as intermediaries in the slave, ivory, and beeswax trades, acting as carriers, entrepreneurs, and raiders. With the decline of the slave trade in the last decades of the nineteenth century, the entrepreneurs among the Ovimbundu turned to the rubber trade, abandoning the warfare and raiding that had hitherto been integrally related to their economic activities. The rubber slump at the beginning of the twentieth century, the end of the de facto autonomy of their kingdoms not long after, and the displacement of Ovimbundu traders by the Portuguese forced these people to turn to cash-crop agriculture. (The men had hitherto had little involvement with cultivation; in fact, the women continued to be responsible for the cultivation of subsistence crops.)

The introduction of cash crops, particularly coffee, led to a series of changes in settlement patterns and social arrangements. But after a time, soil exhaustion, lack of support of African agriculture by the colonial authorities, incursions of Portuguese settlers who took over valuable property in the highlands, and a number of other factors contributed to a decline in the success of Ovimbundu cash-crop agriculture. By the early 1960s, up to 100,000 Ovimbundu, estimated at one-quarter of the group&#x27;s able-bodied adult males, were migrating on one-year and two-year labor contracts to the coffee plantations of Uíge and Cuanza Norte provinces; another 15,000 to 20,000 sought work in Luanda and Lobito; and roughly the same number worked in the industrial plants of Huambo or for European farmers in the Benguela Plateau. In most cases, remuneration was low, but these migrant workers had little alternative. This pattern continued through the remainder of the colonial period, except for those males who were involved in nationalist activity (usually with UNITA).

In the 1940s, the Ovimbundu organized what was probably the most closely knit Angolan community of the colonial era. With the financial and ideological aid of North American Christian missionaries, they established a network of Christian villages, each with its own leadership, schools, churches, and clinics. They were thus able to maintain the Ovimbundu culture while providing educational and social amenities for their children. The generation that emerged from this structure became the disciples of Jonas Savimbi and the basis for UNITA, which in the 1980s used the same concepts to maintain Ovimbundu cohesiveness within UNITA-controlled areas.

Given the degree of change in Ovimbundu society and the involvement of the Ovimbundu with UNITA, it was difficult to determine their long-range role in Angolan politics. Just how long Ovimbundu solidarity would persist under changing circumstances could not be predicted.

===Mbundu===
Just north of Ovimbundu territory lived the Mbundu, the second largest ethnolinguistic category, whose language was Kimbundu. In 1988 they made up an estimated 25 percent of the Angolan population. In the sixteenth century, most of the groups that came to be known as Mbundu (a name apparently first applied by the neighboring Bakongo) lived well to the east of the coast in the plateau region (at a somewhat lower altitude than the Ovimbundu); a few groups in the far northeast lived at altitudes below 700 meters. In general, the outlines of the area occupied by the Mbundu had remained the same. The major exception was their expansion of this area to parts of the coast formerly occupied by Bakongo and others.

Although most of the boundaries of Mbundu territory remained fairly firm, the social and linguistic boundaries of the category had shifted, some of the peripheral groups having been variably influenced by neighboring groups and the groups close to the coast having been more strongly influenced by the Portuguese than were the more remote ones. Moreover, the subdivisions discernible for the sixteenth century (and perhaps earlier) also changed in response to a variety of social and linguistic influences in the colonial period. The Mbundu in general and the western Mbundu in particular, located as they were not far from Luanda, were susceptible to those influences for a longer time and in a more intense way than were other Angolan groups.

There were a number of Kimbundu dialects and groups. Two, each incorporating Portuguese terms, gradually became dominant, serving as lingua francas for many Mbundu. The western dialect was centered in Luanda, to which many Mbundu had migrated over the years. The people speaking it, largely urban, had come to call themselves Ambundu or Akwaluanda, thus distinguishing themselves from rural Mbundu. The eastern dialect, known as Ambakista, had its origins in the eighteenth century in a mixed Portuguese-Mbundu trading center at Ambaca near the western edge of the plateau region, but it spread in the nineteenth century through much of eastern Mbundu territory. Another Kimbundu-speaking group, the Dembos, were generally included in the Mbundu category. Living north of Luanda, they had also been strongly influenced by Kikongo speakers.

By the late 1960s, the Mbundu living in the cities, such as Luanda and Malanje, had adopted attributes of Portuguese lifestyle . Many had intermarried with Portuguese, which led to the creation of an entirely new class of mestiços. Those who received formal education and fully adopted Portuguese customs became assimilados.

The Mbundu were the MPLA&#x27;s strongest supporters when the movement first formed in 1956. The MPLA&#x27;s president, Agostinho Neto, was the son of a Mbundu Methodist pastor and a graduate of a Portuguese medical school. In the 1980s, the Mbundu were predominant in Luanda, Bengo, Cuanza Norte, Malanje, and northern Cuanza Sul provinces.

===Bakongo===

The Kikongo-speaking Bakongo made up an estimated 15 percent of the Angolan population. In 1988 the Bakongo were the third largest ethnolinguistic group in Angola. Concentrated in Uíge, Zaire, and Cabinda provinces, where they constituted a majority of the population, the Bakongo spilled over into the nation of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (where they were the largest single ethnic group) and Congo. Although the Angolan city of São Salvador (renamed Mbanza Congo) was the capital of their ancient kingdom, most of the Bakongo were situated in Zaire.

Their former political unity long broken, the various segments of the ethnolinguistic category in Angola experienced quite different influences in the colonial period. The Bashikongo, living near the coast, had the most sustained interaction with the Portuguese but were less affected by participation in the coffee economy than the Sosso and Pombo, who were situated farther east and south. All three groups, however, were involved in the uprising of 1961. The Pombo, still farther east but close to the Zairian border, were much influenced by developments in the Belgian Congo (present-day DR Congo), and a large contingent of Pombo living in Léopoldville (present-day Kinshasa) formed a political party in the early 1950s. The Solongo, dwelling on the relatively dry coastal plain, had little contact with the Portuguese. They and the Ashiluanda of the island of Luanda, to the south, were Angola&#x27;s only African sea fishermen.

The Mayombe (also spelled Maiombe) of the mountain forests of Cabinda spoke a dialect of Kikongo but were not part of the ancient kingdom. That part of the Mayombe living in Zaire did join with the Zairian Bakongo in the Alliance of Bakongo (Alliance des Bakongo – Abako) during the period of party formation in the Belgian Congo, but the Cabindan Mayombe (and other Kikongo-speaking groups in the enclave), relatively remote geographically and culturally from the Bakongo of Angola proper, showed no solidarity with the latter. Instead, in 1961 the Mayombe formed a Cabindan separatist movement, the Alliance of Mayombe (Alliance de Mayombe – Alliama), which merged with two other Cabindan separatist movements in 1963 to form the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (Frente para a Libertação do Enclave de Cabinda – FLEC).

One of the first major revolts of the nationalist struggle was instigated by Bakongo in March 1961 in the northwest. The Portuguese crushed the peasant attack, organized by the Bakongo group, the Union of Angolan Peoples (União das Populações de Angola – UPA), on their settlements, farms, and administrative outposts. Subsequently, 400,000 Bakongo fled into Zaire. In 1962 the UPA formed the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola – FNLA), which became one of the three major nationalist groups (the other two being the MPLA and UNITA) involved in the long and bloody war of independence. Most of the FNLA&#x27;s traditional Bakongo constituency fled into exile in Zaire during the war. Following independence, however, many Bakongo exiles returned to their traditional homesteads in Angola. They had since retained their ethnolinguistic integrity.

The Bakongo are a matriarchal tribe, which means that the women have the authority and power in the tribe.

===Lunda-Chokwe===
The hyphenated category Lunda-Chokwe constituted an estimated 8 percent of the Angolan population in 1988. As the hyphenation implies, the category comprises at least two subsets, the origins of which are known to be different and the events leading to their inclusion in a single set are recent. The Lunda alone were a congeries of peoples brought together in the far-flung Lunda Empire (seventeenth century to nineteenth century) under the hegemony of a people calling themselves Ruund, its capital in the eastern section of Zaire&#x27;s Katanga Province (present-day Shaba Province). Lunda is the form of the name used for the Ruund and for themselves by adjacent peoples to the south who came under Ruund domination. In some sources, the Ruund are called Northern Lunda, and their neighbors are called Southern Lunda. The most significant element of the latter, called Ndembu (or Ndembo), lived in Zaire and Zambia. In Angola the people with whom the northward-expanding Chokwe came into contact were chiefly Ruund speakers. The economic and political decline of the empire by the second half of the nineteenth century and the demarcation of colonial boundaries ended Ruund political domination over those elements beyond the Zairian borders.

The Chokwe, until the latter half of the nineteenth century a small group of hunters and traders living near the headwaters of the Cuango and Cassai rivers, were at the southern periphery of the Lunda Empire and paid tribute to its head. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Chokwe became increasingly involved in trading and raiding, and they expanded in all directions, but chiefly to the north, in part absorbing the Ruund and other peoples. In the late nineteenth century, the Chokwe went so far as to invade the capital of the much-weakened empire in Katanga. As a consequence of this Chokwe activity, a mixed population emerged in parts of Zaire as well as in Angola, although there were virtually homogenous communities in both countries consisting of Chokwe, Ruund, or Southern Lunda.

The intermingling of Lunda (Ruund and Southern Lunda) and Chokwe, in which other smaller groups were presumably also caught up, continued until about 1920. It was only after that time that the mixture acquired the hyphenated label and its members began to think of themselves (in some contexts) as one people.

The languages spoken by the various elements of the so-called Lunda-Chokwe were more closely related to each other than to other Bantu languages in the Zairian-Angolan savanna but were by no means mutually intelligible. The three major tongues (Ruund, Lunda, and Chokwe) had long been distinct from each other, although some borrowing of words, particularly of Ruund political titles by the others, had occurred.

Portuguese anthropologists and some others accepting their work have placed some of the peoples (Minungu and Shinji) in this area with the Mbundu, and the Minungu language is sometimes considered a transitional one between Kimbundu and Chokwe. There may in fact have been important Mbundu influence on these two peoples, but the work of a number of linguists places their languages firmly with the set that includes Ruund, Lunda, and Chokwe.

Economic and political developments in the 1970s affected various sections of the Lunda-Chokwe differently. Substantial numbers of them live in or near Lunda Norte Province, which contains the principal diamond mines of Angola. Diamond mining had been significant since 1920, and preindependence data show that the industry employed about 18,000 persons. Moreover, the mining company provided medical and educational facilities for its employees and their dependents, thereby affecting even greater numbers. How many of those employed were Lunda-Chokwe is not clear, although neighboring villages would have been affected by the presence of the mining complex in any case. In the intra-Angolan political conflict preceding and immediately following independence, there apparently was some division between the northern Lunda-Chokwe, especially those with some urban experience, who tended to support the MPLA, and the rural Chokwe, particularly those farther south, who tended to support UNITA. In the 1980s, as the UNITA insurgency intensified in the border areas of eastern and northern Angola, Lunda-Chokwe families were forced to flee into Zaire&#x27;s Shaba Province, where many remained in 1988, living in three sites along the Benguela Railway. The impact of this move on the ethnolinguistic integrity of these people was not known.

A somewhat different kind of political impact began in the late 1960s, when refugees from Katanga in Zaire, speakers of Lunda or a related language, crossed the border into what are now Lunda Sul and northern Moxico provinces. In 1977 and 1978, these refugees and others whom they had recruited formed the National Front for the Liberation of the Congo (Front National pour la Libération du Congo – FNLC) and used the area as a base from which they launched their invasions of Shaba Province. In the 1980s, these rebels and perhaps still other refugees remained in Angola, many in Lunda Sul Province, although the Angolan government as part of its rapprochement with Zaire was encouraging them to return to their traditional homes. The Zairian government offered amnesty to political exiles on several occasions in the late 1980s and conferred with the Angolan government on the issue of refugees. In 1988, however, a significant number of Zairian refugees continued to inhabit LundaChokwe territory. The significance for local Lunda-Chokwe of the presence and activities of these Zairians was not known.

===Nganguela===
Ngangela is generic term for a number of closely related Bantu languages in south-eastern Angola spoken by the Ngonzelo, Luchazi, Nyemba, Luvale, Luimbi, Mbunda, Mbuela, Yauma and Nkangala ethnic groups. Yauma language and Nkangala language are in turn Mbunda dialects. Nkangala, Mbalango, Sango, Ciyengele (&quot;Shamuka&quot;) and Ndundu are closely related.

===Ovambo, Nyaneka-Nkhumbi, Herero, and others===
In far southwestern Angola, three categories of Bantu-speaking peoples have been distinguished. Two of them, the Ovambo and the Herero, were more heavily represented elsewhere: the Ovambo in Namibia and the Herero in Namibia and Botswana. The Herero dispersion, especially that section of it in Botswana, was the consequence of the migration of the Herero from German South West Africa (present-day Namibia) after their rebellion against German rule in 1906. The third group was the Nyaneka-Humbe. Unlike the other groups, the Nyaneka-Humbe did not disperse outside Angola. In 1988 the Nyaneka-Humbe (the first group is also spelled Haneca; the latter group is also spelled Nkumbi) constituted 3 percent of the population. The Ovambo, of which the largest subgroup were the Kwanhama (also spelled Kwanyama), made up an estimated 2 percent of the Angolan population. In the second half of the nineteenth century, the Kwanhama Kingdom of southern Angola was a powerful state involved in a lucrative trade relationship with the Portuguese, who, together with the Germans, occupied Kwanhama territory in the early twentieth century. In the 1980s, the Ovambo were seminomadic cattle herders and farmers. The Herero constituted no more than 0.5 percent of the population in 1988. Traditionally, the Herero were nomadic or seminomadic herders living in the arid coastal lowlands and in the mountainous escarpment to the east in Namibe, Benguela, and Huíla provinces. Many Herero migrated south to Namibia when the Portuguese launched a military expedition against them in 1940 following their refusal to pay taxes.

In the southeastern corner of the country the Portuguese distinguished a set of Bantu-speaking people, described on a map prepared by José Redinha in 1973 as the Xindonga. The sole linguistic group listed in this category was the Cussu. The Language Map of Africa, prepared under the direction of David Dalby for the International African Institute, noted two sets of related languages in southeastern Angola. The first set included Liyuwa, Mashi, and North Mbukushu. These languages and other members of the set were also found in Zambia and Namibia. The members of the second set, Kwangali-Gcikuru and South Mbukushu, were also found in Namibia and Botswana. The hyphen between Kwangali and Gcikuru implies mutual intelligibility. Little is known of these groups; in any case, their members were very few.

All of these southern Angolan groups relied in part or in whole on cattle raising for subsistence. Formerly, the Herero were exclusively herders, but they gradually came to engage in some cultivation. Although the Ovambo had depended in part on cultivation for a much longer time, dairy products had been an important source of subsistence, and cattle were the chief measure of wealth and prestige.

The southwestern groups, despite their remoteness from the major centers of white influence during most of the colonial period, were to varying degrees affected by the colonial presence and, after World War II, by the arrival of numbers of Portuguese in such places as Moçâmedes (present-day Namibe) and Sá da Bandeira (present-day Lubango). The greatest resistance to the Portuguese was offered by the Ovambo, who were not made fully subject to colonial rule until 1915 and who earned a considerable reputation among the Portuguese and other Africans for their efforts to maintain their independence. In the nationalist struggle of the 1960s and early 1970s and in the postindependence civil war, the Ovambo tended to align themselves with the Ovimbundu-dominated UNITA. Many also sympathized with the cause of SWAPO, a mostly Ovambo organization fighting to liberate Namibia from South African rule.

===Hunters, gatherers, herders, and others===
Throughout the lower third of Angola, chiefly in the drier areas, were small bands of people. Until the twentieth century, most of them were nomadic hunters and gatherers, although some engaged in herding, either in addition to their other subsistence activities or as their chief means of livelihood. Those who survived turned, at least in part, to cultivation.

The bands living a nomadic or seminomadic life in Cuando Cubango Province (and occasionally reaching as far east as the upper Cunene River) differed physically and linguistically from their sedentary Bantu-speaking neighbors. Short, saffron-colored, and in other respects physically unlike the Nganguela, Ovambo, and Nyaneka-Humbe, they spoke a language of the !Xu-Angola or Maligo set of tongues referred to as Khoisan or Click languages (the exclamation point denotes a specific kind of click), whose precise relations to each other are not yet fully understood by observers.

Several other hunting and gathering or herding groups, the members of which were taller and otherwise physically more like the local Bantu speakers, lived farther west, adjacent to the Ovambo and Herero. These people spoke Bantu languages and were less nomadic than the Khoisan speakers, but they were clearly different from the Ovambo and Herero and probably preceded them in the area. As with most African art, the wooden masks and sculptures of Angola are not merely aesthetic creations. They play an important role in cultural rituals, representing life and death, the passage from childhood to adulthood, the celebration of a new harvest and the marking of the hunting season.
Angolan artisans work in wood, bronze, ivory, malachite or ceramic mediums. Each ethno-linguistic group in Angola has its own unique artistic traits. Perhaps the single most famous piece of Angolan art is the Cokwe thinker, a masterpiece of harmony and symmetry of line. The Lunda-Cokwe in the north eastern part of Angola is also known for its superior plastic arts.

Other signature pieces of Angolan art include the female mask Mwnaa-Pwo worn by male dancers in their puberty rituals, the polychromatic Kalelwa masks used during circumcision ceremonies, Cikungu and Cihongo masks which conjure up the images of the Lunda-Cokwe mythology (two key figures in this pantheon are princess Lweji and the civilizing prince Tschibinda-Ilunga), and the black ceramic art of Moxico of central/eastern Angola.

===Mestiço===
In 1960 a little more than 1 percent of the total population of Angola consisted of &quot;mestiços&quot;. It has been estimated that by 1970 these people constituted perhaps 2 percent of the population. Some &quot;mestiços&quot; left at independence, but the departure of much greater numbers of Portuguese probably resulted in an increase in the proportion of &quot;mestiços&quot; in the Angolan total. In 1988 &quot;mestiços&quot; probably continued to number about 2 percent of the Angolan population.

The process of mixing started very early and continued until independence. But it was not until about 1900, when the number of Portuguese in Angola was very small and consisted almost entirely of males, that the percentage of &quot;mestiços&quot; in the population exceeded the percentage of whites.

After a number of generations, the antecedents of many &quot;mestiços&quot; became mixed to the extent that the Portuguese felt a need to establish a set of distinctions among them. Many &quot;mestiços&quot; accepted this system as a means of social ranking. One source suggests that the term &quot;mestiço&quot; used alone in a social context applied specifically to the offspring of a mulatto and a white; the term &quot;mestiço cabrito&quot; referred to the descendant of a union between two mulattos; and the term &quot;mestico cafuso&quot; was applied to the child of a union between a mulatto and a black African. It is possible that an even more complex set of distinctions was sometimes used.

Most &quot;mestiços&quot; were urban dwellers and had learned to speak Portuguese either as a household language or in school. Although some of the relatively few rural &quot;mestiços&quot; lived like the Africans among whom they dwelt, most apparently achieved the status of &quot;assimilados,&quot; the term applied before 1961 to those nonwhites who fulfilled certain specific requirements and were therefore registered as Portuguese citizens.

With some exceptions, &quot;mestiços&quot; tended to identify with Portuguese culture, and their strongly voiced opposition over the years to the conditions imposed by the colonial regime stressed their rights to a status equivalent to that of whites. Before World War II, only occasionally did &quot;mestiço&quot; intellectuals raise their voices on behalf of the African population. Thus, despite the involvement of &quot;mestiços&quot; in the nationalist struggle beginning in 1961 and their very important role in the upper echelons of the government and party, significant segments of the African population tended to resent them. This legacy continued in the late 1980s because &quot;mestiços&quot; dominated the MPLA-PT hierarchy.

Starting in the late 1970s, an average of 50,000 Cuban troops and civilian technical personnel (the overwhelming majority of whom were male) were stationed in Angola. As a result, a portion of the nation&#x27;s younger population was undoubtedly of mixed African and Cuban descent. This new category of racial mixture, however, had not been described by researchers as of late 1988, and no figures existed on how many Angolans might fall into this category.

<text>The Romanian Orthodox Church (ROC; , ), or Romanian Patriarchate, is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox church in full communion with other Eastern Orthodox Christian churches, and one of the nine patriarchates in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Since 1925, the church&#x27;s Primate has borne the title of Patriarch. Its jurisdiction covers the territories of Romania and Moldova, with additional dioceses for Romanians living in nearby Ukraine, Serbia and Hungary, as well as for diaspora communities in Central and Western Europe, North America and Oceania. It is the only autocephalous church within Eastern Orthodoxy to have a Romance language for liturgical use.

The majority of Romania&#x27;s population (16,367,267, or 85.9% of those for whom data were available, according to the 2011 census data), as well as some 720,000 Moldovans, belong to the Romanian Orthodox Church.

Members of the Romanian Orthodox Church sometimes refer to Orthodox Christian doctrine as &quot;Dreapta credință&quot; (&quot;right/correct belief&quot; or &quot;true faith&quot;; compare to Greek ὀρθὴ δόξα, &quot;straight/correct belief&quot;).

==History==

===In the Principalities and the Kingdom of Romania===
The Orthodox hierarchy in the territory of modern Romania had existed within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople until 1865 when the churches in the Romanian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia embarked on the path of ecclesiastical independence by nominating Nifon Rusailă, Metropolitan of Ungro-Wallachia, as the first Romanian primate. Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza, who had in 1863 carried out a mass confiscation of monastic estates in the face of stiff opposition from the Greek hierarchy in Constantinople, in 1865 pushed through a legislation that proclaimed complete independence of the church in the principalities from the patriarchate.

In 1872, the Orthodox churches in the principalities, the Metropolis of Ungro-Wallachia and the Metropolis of Moldavia, merged to form the Romanian Orthodox Church.

Following the international recognition of the independence of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (later Kingdom of Romania) in 1878, after a long period of negotiations with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Patriarch Joachim IV granted recognition to the autocephalous Metropolis of Romania in 1885, which was raised to the rank of Patriarchate in 1925.

Romanian Orthodox theological education was underdeveloped at the end of the nineteenth century. The theological institute at Sibiu, for example, had only one theologian as part of its faculty; the rest were historians, journalists, naturalists, and agronomists. The focus of priestly education was practical and general rather than specialized. In the early twentieth century, the curriculum of a priest included subjects such as hygiene, calligraphy, accountancy, psychology, Romanian literature, geometry, chemistry, botany, and gymnastics. A strong emphasis was placed on church music, canon law, church history, and exegesis.

After World War I, the Kingdom of Romania significantly increased its territory. Consequently, the Romanian Orthodox Church needed massive reorganization in order to incorporate congregations from these new provinces. This led to shortages and difficulties. The Church had to establish a uniform interpretation of canon law. It had to handle public funds for paying clergymen in the newly acquired territories and, generally speaking, manage the relationship with the state. The legislation was intricate. The &quot;Statute on the organization of the Romanian Orthodox Church&quot; adopted by the Romanian parliament on May 6, 1925, counted 178 articles. The law on the functioning of the Romanian Orthodox Church counted 46 articles. Legislators adopted the Transylvanian tradition of mixing clergymen and laymen in administrative assemblies and granted bishops seats in the Romanian Senate. However, the context also allowed a number of young theologians like Nichifor Crainic, Ioan Savin, or Dumitru Stăniloae to study abroad. These theologians proved extremely influential after their return to Romania and helped shape theological academies. With a few rare exceptions, like Gala Galaction, the Romanian Orthodox theologians of this period embraced nationalism. Their scholarly works are thus imbued with nationalist ideology.

The second half of the 1920s is marked by the rise of antisemitism in Romanian politics with figures such as A.C. Cuza or Iron Guard founding father Codreanu. Antisemitism also became apparent in church publications. In 1925, for instance, church journal &quot;Revista Teologică (The Theological Review)&quot; published an anti-Semitic article by Sibiu professor priest Pompiliu Morușca. Morușca&#x27;s article blamed the Jews for the economic situation of Romanians in Bukovina. It is a testimony of an older form of anti-Semitism going back to the 19th century. The Romanian Orthodox Church would evolve different forms of antisemitism in the 1930s. The Concordat of 1927 also triggered anti-Catholic reactions.

=== 1930s - Patriarch Miron Cristea&#x27;s premiership ===

The rise of Nazi Germany exposed Romania to the Reich&#x27;s theological ideas. This mixture of nationalism, racism and theological thought found fertile ground in a Romanian Orthodox Church that was already no stranger to antisemitism. It became particularly evident in the second half of the 1930s in the writings of theologians such as Nichifor Crainic, Nicolae Neaga or Liviu Stan.

In 1936, Crainic published a seminal text titled &quot;Rasă și religiune (Race and Religion)&quot;. While rejecting the Nazi idea of a superior Germanic race, as well as the fascination with Germanic paganism, Crainic argued that some races are indeed superior based on their accomplishment of the Christian essence. Crainic also denied the Jews the moral right to use the books of the Old Testament since, according to him, those prophesies had been fulfilled by the coming of Christ who had abolished the Jewish religion.

The deaths of prominent Iron Guard members Ion Moța and Vasile Marin on the same day, January 13, 1937, at Majadahonda during the Spanish Civil War while fighting for the Nationalist faction led to the organization of massive processions in Romania, particularly in Bucharest where they were interred. Hundreds of Orthodox priests participated and Metropolitans Nicolae Bălan of Transylvania and Visarion Puiu of Bukovina held special services. Shortly after the funeral, Orthodox theologian Gheorghe Racoveanu and priest Grigore Cristescu founded the theological journal &quot;Predania (The Tradinion)&quot;. The first issue featured a glorification of Moța and Marin and their sacrifice and reflected the Guard&#x27;s obsession for martyrdom. Intended as a bi-monthly &quot;Predania&quot; printed a total of twelve issues before being banned by the authorities. It stood out for its profoundly anti-ecumenical editorial line, publishing attacks against Catholics, Protestants, Evangelicals.

Also in the aftermath of Moța and Marin&#x27;s grandiose funeral, the Holy Synod issued a condemnation of Freemasonry. Moreover, following the lead of Metropolitan Bălan who wrote the anti-Masonic manifest, the Synod issued a &quot;Christian point of view&quot; against political secularism stating that the Church was in its right to choose which party was worthy of support, based on its moral principles. Iron Guard leader Codreanu saluted the Synod&#x27;s position and instructed that the Synod&#x27;s proclamation should be read by Guard members in their respective &quot;nests&quot; (i.e. chapters).

In 1937, the Goga-Cuza government was the first to adopt and enact antisemitic legislation in the Kingdom of Romania, stripping over two hundred thousand Jews of their citizenship. That very same year, the head of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Cristea made an infamous speech in which he described the Jews as parasites who suck the bone marrow of the Romanian people and who should leave the country. The Orthodox church directly or indirectly supported far-right parties and antisemitic intellectuals in their anti-Jewish rhetoric. At the time many Orthodox priests had become active in far-right politics, thus in the 1937 parliamentary elections 33 out of 103 Iron Guard candidates were Orthodox priests. 

Overall, the church became increasingly involved in politics and, after King Carol II assumed emergency powers, Patriarch Miron Cristea became prime-minister in February 1938. In March 1938, the Holy Synod banned the conversion of Jews who were unable to prove their Romanian citizenship. Cristea continued the policies of the Goga-Cuza government but also advocated more radical antisemitic measures including deportation and exclusion from employment. Cristea referred to this last measure as &quot;Romanianization&quot;. The church newspaper &quot;Apostolul&quot; was instrumental in propagating Cristea&#x27;s antisemitic ideas throughout his premiership but church press as a whole became flooded with antisemitic materials. Miron Cristea died in March 1939. Soon after, the Holy Synod voted to uphold regulations adopted under Cristea banning the baptism of Jews who were not Romanian citizens.

Cristea&#x27;s death led to elections being held in order to select a new Patriarch. Metropolitans Visarion Puiu and the highly influential Nicolae Bălan publicly declared their refusal to enter the race. Both of these bishops held pro-German, pro-Iron-Guard and antisemitic views and it is reasonable to assume that King Carol II&#x27;s opposition was instrumental in their refusal. Thus, the patriarchal office passed to a reluctant Nicodim Munteanu.

=== 1940s - World War II ===

King Carol II abdicated on September 6, 1940. An openly pro-German coalition of the military headed by marshal Ion Antonescu and the Iron Guard took over. Patriarch Nicodim Munteanu&#x27;s reaction was cautious and his September 1940 address was unenthusiastic. Munteanu, like Cristea before him, feared the anti-establishment nature of the Guard. But the Iron Guard was highly influential on the Church&#x27;s grassroots. In January 1941, seeking full control of the country, the Iron Guard attempted a violent insurrection known as the Legionary Rebellion. The putsch failed and out of the 9000 people arrested, 422 were Orthodox priests.
Some particularly violent episodes during the insurrection directly involved the Orthodox clergy. Students and staff of the Theological Academy in Sibiu, led by Professor Spiridon Cândea and assisted by Iron Guard militiamen rounded up Jews in the courtyard of the academy and forced them to hand over their valuables at gunpoint. Monks from the Antim Monastery in Bucharest, led by their abbot, armed themselves and, using explosives, blew up a Synagogue on Antim Street. The numerous Jewish inhabitants of the neighborhood hid in terror.

After Antonescu and the Army crushed the insurrection, the Holy Synod was quick to condemn the Legionary Rebellion and publicly paint it as a diabolical temptation that had led the Iron Guard to undermine the state and the Conducător. Many of the clergymen who had participated in the Rebellion were, however, shielded by their bishops and continued parish work in remote villages. Romania&#x27;s participation in World War II on the Axis side after June 1941 would provide them with opportunities for rehabilitation.

By the early 1940s, Orthodox theologians such as Nichifor Crainic already had a lengthy record of producing propaganda supporting the concept of Judeo-Bolshevism. After 1941 the idea became commonplace in central church newspapers such as &quot;Apostolul&quot; or &quot;BOR&quot;. A particularly infamous article was signed by Patriarch Nicodim himself and published in &quot;BOR&quot; in April 1942. It referred to the danger of domestic enemies whom he identified as mostly being Jewish. In 1943 &quot;BOR&quot; published a 13-page laudatory review of Nichifor Crainic&#x27;s infamous antismetic book &quot;Transfigurarea Românismului&quot; &quot;(The Transfiguration of Romanianism)&quot;. Antisemitism was also present in regional journals, a leading example being Dumitru Stăniloae&#x27;s &quot;Telegraful român&quot; (&quot;The Romanian Telegraph&quot;). Orthodox chaplains in the Romanian army cultivated the Judeo-Bolshevik myth.

A particular case was Romanian-occupied Transnistria. On August 15, 1941, The Holy Synod established a mission, rather than a new bishopric, in Romanian-occupied territories across the Dniester. The assumption was that Soviet atheist rule had destroyed the Russian Orthodox Church and the Romanian Orthodox Church took it upon itself to &quot;re-evangelize&quot; the locals. The main architect of the enterprise was Archimandrite Iuliu Scriban. In 1942 the Mission evolved into an Exarchate and was taken over by Visarion Puiu. Many of the missionaries were former affiliates of the Iron Guard, some were seeking rehabilitation after the 1941 insurrection. Abuse against the Jewish population was widespread and numerous reports of Orthodox priests partaking and profiting from the abuse exist. In 1944, Visarion Puiu fled to Nazi Germany, then, after the war, in the West. In Romania he was tried and convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; after the war. Many priests active in Transnistria also faced prosecution after the war, although communist prosecutors were mostly looking for connections to the Iron Guard, rather than explicitly investigating the persecution of Jews.

Historical evidence regarding the Romanian Orthodox Church&#x27;s role in World War II is overwhelmingly incriminating but there are a few exceptions. Tit Simedrea, metropolitan of Bukovina is one two high-ranking bishops known to have interceded in favor of the Jewish population, the other being the metropolitan Nicolae Bălan of Transylvania. Evidence also surfaced that Simedrea personally sheltered a Jewish family in the metropolitanate compound.
Priest Gheorghe Petre was recognized as Righteous Among the Nations for having saved Jews in Kryve Ozero. Petre was arrested in 1943 and court-martialed but was released in 1944 for lack of evidence.

After King Michael&#x27;s Coup on August 23, 1944, Romania switched sides. The coup had been backed by the communists; the Church, known for its long-term record of anti-Soviet and anti-communist rhetoric now found itself in an awkward position. Patriarch Nicodim was quick to write a pastoral letter denouncing the previous dictatorship, blaming the Germans for the events that had taken place in Romania during the 30s and during the war and praising &quot;the powerful neighbor from the East&quot; with whom Romania had, supposedly, always had &quot;the best political, cultural, and religious relations.&quot;

Starting in 1944, and even more after Petru Groza became Prime-minister with Soviet support in 1945, the Church tried to adapt to the new political situation. In August 1945 a letter of the Holy Synod was published in &quot;BOR&quot;. Again, it blamed the Germans for the horrors of the war and claimed that the Orthodox Church had always promoted democracy. The Romania Army was also praised for having joined forces with &quot;the brave Soviet armies in the war against the true adversaries of our country.&quot; Finally, the Orthodox faithful were asked to fully support the new government. Later that year &quot;BOR&quot; published two relatively long articles authored by Bishop Antim Nica and, respectively, by Teodor Manolache. Both articles dealt with the Holocaust and painted the Romanian Orthodox Church as a savior of Jews.

===Communist period===
Romania officially became a communist state in 1947. Restricted access to ecclesiastical and relevant state archives makes an accurate assessment of the Romanian Orthodox Church&#x27;s attitude towards the Communist regime a difficult proposition. Nevertheless, the activity of the Orthodox Church as an institution was more or less tolerated by the Marxist–Leninist atheist regime, although it was controlled through &quot;special delegates&quot; and its access to the public sphere was severely limited; the regime&#x27;s attempts at repression generally focused on individual believers. The attitudes of the church&#x27;s members, both laity and clergy, towards the communist regime, range broadly from opposition and martyrdom, to silent consent, collaboration or subservience aimed at ensuring survival. Beyond limited access to the Securitate and Party archives as well as the short time elapsed since these events unfolded, such an assessment is complicated by the particularities of each individual and situation, the understanding each had about how their own relationship with the regime could influence others and how it actually did.

The Romanian Workers&#x27; Party, which assumed political power at the end of 1947, initiated mass purges that resulted in a decimation of the Orthodox hierarchy. Three archbishops died suddenly after expressing opposition to government policies, and thirteen more &quot;uncooperative&quot; bishops and archbishops were arrested. A May 1947 decree imposed a mandatory retirement age for clergy, thus providing authorities with a convenient way to pension off old-guard holdouts. The 4 August 1948 Law on Cults institutionalised state control over episcopal elections and packed the Holy Synod with Communist supporters. The evangelical wing of the Romanian Orthodox Church, known as the Army of the Lord, was suppressed by communist authorities in 1948. In exchange for subservience and enthusiastic support for state policies, the property rights over as many as 2,500 church buildings and other assets belonging to the (by then-outlawed) Romanian Greek-Catholic Church were transferred to the Romanian Orthodox Church; the government took charge of providing salaries for bishops and priests, as well as financial subsidies for the publication of religious books, calendars and theological journals. By weeding out the anti-communists from among the Orthodox clergy and setting up a pro-regime, secret police-infiltrated Union of Democratic Priests (1945), the party endeavoured to secure the hierarchy&#x27;s cooperation. By January 1953 some 300–500 Orthodox priests were being held in concentration camps, and following Patriarch Nicodim&#x27;s death in May 1948, the party succeeded in having the ostensibly docile Justinian Marina elected to succeed him.

As a result of measures passed in 1947–48, the state took over the 2,300 elementary schools and 24 high schools operated by the Orthodox Church. A new campaign struck the church in 1958–1962 when more than half of its remaining monasteries were closed, more than 2,000 monks were forced to take secular jobs, and about 1,500 clergy and lay activists were arrested (out of a total of up to 6,000 in the 1946–1964 period). Throughout this period Patriarch Justinian took great care that his public statements met the regime&#x27;s standards of political correctness and to avoid giving offence to the government; indeed the hierarchy at the time claimed that the arrests of clergy members were not due to religious persecution.

The church&#x27;s situation began to improve in 1962, when relations with the state suddenly thawed, an event that coincided with the beginning of Romania&#x27;s pursuit of an independent foreign policy course that saw the political elite encourage nationalism as a means to strengthen its position against Soviet pressure. The Romanian Orthodox Church, an intensely national body that had made significant contributions to Romanian culture from the 14th century on, came to be regarded by the regime as a natural partner. As a result of this second co-optation, this time as an ally, the church entered a period of dramatic recovery. By 1975, its diocesan clergy was numbering about 12,000, and the church was already publishing by then eight high-quality theological reviews, including &quot;Ortodoxia&quot; and &quot;Studii Teologice&quot;. Orthodox clergymen consistently supported the Ceaușescu regime&#x27;s foreign policy, refrained from criticizing domestic policy, and upheld the Romanian government&#x27;s line against the Soviets (over Bessarabia) and the Hungarians (over Transylvania). As of 1989, two metropolitan bishops even sat in the Great National Assembly. The members of the church&#x27;s hierarchy and clergy remained mostly silent as some two dozen historic Bucharest churches were demolished in the 1980s, and as plans for systematization (including the destruction of village churches) were announced. A notable dissenter was Gheorghe Calciu-Dumitreasa, imprisoned for a number of years and eventually expelled from Romania in June 1985, after signing an open letter criticizing and demanding an end to the regime&#x27;s violations of human rights.

In an attempt to adapt to the newly created circumstances, the Eastern Orthodox Church proposed a new ecclesiology designed to justify its subservience to the state in supposedly theological terms. This so-called &quot;Social Apostolate&quot; doctrine, developed by Patriarch Justinian, asserted that the church owed allegiance to the secular government and should put itself at its service. This notion inflamed conservatives, who were consequently purged by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Ceaușescu&#x27;s predecessor and a friend of Justinian&#x27;s. The Social Apostolate called on clerics to become active in the People&#x27;s Republic, thus laying the foundation for the church&#x27;s submission to and collaboration with the state. Fr. Vasilescu, an Orthodox priest, attempted to find grounds in support of the Social Apostolate doctrine in the Christian tradition, citing Augustine of Hippo, John Chrysostom, Maximus the Confessor, Origen and Tertullian. Based on this alleged grounding in tradition, Vasilescu concluded that Christians owed submission to their secular rulers as if it were the will of God. Once recalcitrants were removed from office, the remaining bishops adopted a servile attitude, endorsing Ceauşescu&#x27;s concept of nation, supporting his policies, and applauding his peculiar ideas about peace.

===Collaboration with the Securitate===

In the wake of the Romanian Revolution, the church never admitted to having ever willingly collaborated with the regime, although several Romanian Orthodox priests have publicly admitted after 1989 that they had collaborated with and/or served as informers for the Securitate, the secret police. A prime example was Bishop Nicolae Corneanu, the Metropolitan of Banat, who admitted to his efforts on behalf of the Romanian Communist Party, and denounced activities of clerics in support of the Communists, including his own, as &quot;the Church&#x27;s [act of] prostitution with the Communist regime&quot;.

In 1986, Metropolitan Antonie Plămădeală defended Ceaușescu&#x27;s church demolition programme as part of the need for urbanization and modernisation in Romania. The church hierarchy refused to try to inform the international community about what was happening.

Widespread dissent from religious groups in Romania did not appear until revolution was sweeping across Eastern Europe in 1989. The Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church Teoctist Arăpașu supported Ceaușescu up until the end of the regime, and even congratulated him after the state murdered one hundred demonstrators in Timișoara. It was not until the day before Ceaușescu&#x27;s execution on 24 December 1989 that the Patriarch condemned him as &quot;a new child-murdering Herod&quot;.

Following the removal of Communism, the Patriarch resigned (only to return a few months after) and the Holy Synod apologised for those &quot;who did not have the courage of the martyrs&quot;.

===After 1989===

As Romania made the transition to democracy, the church was freed from most of its state control, although the State Secretariat for Religious Denominations still maintains control over a number of aspects of the church&#x27;s management of property, finances and administration. The state provides funding for the church in proportion to the number of its members, based on census returns and &quot;the religion&#x27;s needs&quot; which is considered to be an &quot;ambiguous provision&quot;. Currently, the state provides the funds necessary for paying the salaries of priests, deacons and other prelates and the pensions of retired clergy, as well as for expenses related to lay church personnel. For the Orthodox church this is over 100 million euros for salaries, with additional millions for construction and renovation of church property. The same applies to all state-recognised religions in Romania.

The state also provides support for church construction and structural maintenance, with a preferential treatment of Orthodox parishes. The state funds all the expenses of Orthodox seminaries and colleges, including teachers&#x27; and professors&#x27; salaries who, for compensation purposes, are regarded as civil servants.

Since the fall of Communism, Greek-Catholic Church leaders have claimed that the Eastern Catholic community is facing a cultural and religious wipe-out: the Greek-Catholic churches are allegedly being destroyed by representatives of the Eastern Orthodox Church, whose actions are supported and accepted by the Romanian authorities.

The church openly supported banning same-sex marriage in a referendum in 2018. The church believes that homosexuality is a sin and unnatural.

===In the Republic of Moldova===

The Romanian Orthodox Church also has jurisdiction over a minority of believers in Moldova, who belong to the Metropolis of Bessarabia, as opposed to the majority, who belong to the Metropolis of Chișinău and All Moldova, under the Moscow Patriarchate. In 2001 it won a landmark legal victory against the Government of Moldova at the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights.

This means that despite current political issues, the Metropolis of Bessarabia is now recognized as &quot;the rightful successor&quot; to the Metropolitan Church of Bessarabia and Hotin, which existed from 1927 until its dissolution in 1944, when its canonical territory was put under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church&#x27;s Moscow Patriarchate in 1947.

After the debut of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Romanian Orthodox Church in Moldova has seen a significant number of parishes switching afilliation from the Moscow controlled Metropolis of Chișinău and All Moldova to the Metropolis of Bessarabia, sometimes smoothly, otherwise through intense debates and highly polemicized switches.

==Organization and leadership==


The Romanian Orthodox Church is organized in the form of the Romanian Patriarchate. The highest hierarchical, canonical and dogmatical authority of the Romanian Orthodox Church is the Holy Synod.

There are ten Orthodox Metropolitanates, twenty archbishoprics, twenty-three bishoprics in total, of which four metropolitans and nine bishops administer the Church services for the Romanian Diaspora in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Oceania. An estimated number of over twelve thousand altar servers in parishes, monasteries and social centres of the Church. Almost 400 monasteries exist inside the country, staffed by some 3,500 monks and 5,000 nuns. As of 2004, there are, inside Romania, fifteen theological universities where more than ten thousand students (some of them from Bessarabia, Bukovina and Serbia benefiting from a few Romanian fellowships) currently study for a theological degree. More than 14,500 churches (traditionally named &quot;lăcașe de cult&quot;, or houses of worship) exist in Romania for the Romanian Orthodox believers. As of 2002, almost 1,000 of those were either in the process of being built or rebuilt.

=== Current leadership ===
The patriarchal chair is currently held by His Beatitude Daniel, Archbishop of Bucharest, Metropolitan of Muntenia and Dobrudja, Locum Tenens of &quot;Caesarea in Cappadocia&quot; and Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. The title of Locum tenens of &quot;Caesarea in Cappadocia&quot; is a titular office granted in 1776 by Ecumenical Patriarch Sophronius II to the holder of the office of Metropolitan of Ungro-Wallachia, the precursor position of the Orthodox Church to the today Patriarchate of Romania.

==Notable theologians==
Dumitru Stăniloae (1903–1993) is considered one of the greatest Orthodox theologians of the 20th century, having written extensively in all major fields of Eastern Christian systematic theology. One of his other major achievements in theology is the 45-year-long comprehensive series on Orthodox spirituality known as the Romanian Philokalia, a collection of texts written by classical Byzantine writers, that he edited and translated from Greek.

Archimandrite Cleopa Ilie (1912–1998), elder of the &quot;Sihăstria Monastery&quot;, is considered one of the most representative fathers of contemporary Romanian Orthodox monastic spirituality.

Metropolitan Bartolomeu Anania (1921–2011) was the Metropolitan of Cluj, Alba, Crișana and Maramureș from 1993 until his death.

<doc id="384466" wikidata="Q261691" url="?curid=384466" title="Ali Bey al-Kabir">
<text>Ali Bey al-Kabir (, Georgian: ალი ბეი ალ-ქაბირი; 1728 – 8 May 1773) was a Mamluk leader in Egypt. Nicknamed Jinn Ali (&quot;Ali the Devil&quot;) and Bulut Kapan (&quot;Cloud-Catcher&quot;), Ali Bey rose to prominence in 1768 when he rebelled against his Ottoman rulers, making the Egypt Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire independent for a short time. His rule ended following the insubordination of his most trusted general, Abu al-Dahab, which led to Ali Bey&#x27;s downfall and death.

==Origins==

Ali Bey was born in Principality of Abkhazia and was of ethnic Georgian origin. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Islam&quot; adds that according to Ali Bey&#x27;s contemporary biographer, Sauveur Lusignan, he was &quot;supposedly&quot; the son of a certain David, a Greek Orthodox priest. However, according to Alexander Mikaberidze, Ali Bey&#x27;s father was a priest in the Georgian Orthodox Church. He was kidnapped and brought to Cairo, the capital of Ottoman Egypt, in 1741, when he was around 13, and was sold into slavery. He was purchased by two Jewish customs agents who gave him to Ibrahim Ketkhuda in 1743. Ibrahim Ketkhuda was also of Georgian origin.

==Early career==
Although the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and Syria was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1518–1519, the new rulers incorporated the remnant mamluk (manumitted slave soldier) troops and officials into the governance systems of the newly-formed province of Egypt. The Ottoman sultan, wary of concentrating the full extent of Egypt&#x27;s large military and economic resources into the hands of its governor, set up a complex system of government in the province to balance his power. While the governor, always chosen from the Ottoman imperial personnel, remained the sultan&#x27;s chief executive in Egypt and held the high rank of pasha, the defterdar, or treasurer, who was typically a mamluk, was given extensive power over the economy, and held the next highest rank of sanjakbey, often abbreviated to &#x27;bey&#x27;. The province had seven Ottoman army units, called , the most powerful of which was the janissaries. The remnant mamluks maintained a parallel military structure in the province that was initially loyal to the Ottoman rulers, who allowed them to continue importing and training new recruits, critical to the continuation of the mamluk tradition. By the early 18th century, the had become considerably weakened and dominated by the mamluk beys. The powerful offices of the defterdar, the , who wielded executive authority during the absence of the governor, the , who commanded the annual Muslim pilgrim caravan to Mecca, and the chief of the janissaries, were all held by mamluk beys. 

In 1711 a civil war broke between the two dominant mamluk factions of the country, the Faqariya and the Qasimiya, the former backed by the janissaries and the latter by the other Ottoman and a newly-emergent mamluk faction, the Qazdughliya. The Faqariya were trounced during the war, but the victorious Qasimiya splintered into a spent force of warring factions by the 1730s, enabling the rise of the Qazdughliya to power. Despite the internal bloodletting among the mamluks, the civil war had signaled the triumph of the mamluk beys over the Ottoman as the dominant military power in Egypt. For the remainder of the 18th century, the mamluk beys controlled Egypt&#x27;s politics, but their incessant factionalism and internal strife allowed the Ottomans to maintain an important influence in provincial affairs. A testament to the newfound power and prestige of the mamluks in Egypt was the inauguration of a new title, (chief of the country), bestowed by the sultan on the preeminent mamluk bey.

Ali&#x27;s master, Ibrahim Ketkhuda, had led the Qazdughli faction to victory over the Qasimiya in 1730 and in 1739, drove out the head of the Faqariya, Uthman Bey. By 1748, Ibrahim Ketkhuda and his partner in power, Ridwan Ketkhuda, head of the smaller Julfiyya mamluk faction, stabilized the country under their joint leadership. Moving up the ranks in Ibrahim Ketkhuda&#x27;s mamluk household, Ali reached the rank of in 1749. were a rank below the beys, whom they expected to succeed in time, and were chosen among the favorite mamluks of their patron. In the early 18th century, there were thirty-six administrative offices open to , who numbered between sixty and seventy at that time. Their jurisdiction typically included a group of villages in a rural province and they were essentially the most powerful administrators in those parts of the countryside that were not controlled by the Bedouin (nomadic) tribes. 

In 1753 or 1754, Ali was the , the second most important office in the mamluk beylicate of the 18th century. In the course of leading the caravan, he made daring attacks against the Bedouin tribes who dwelt in the desert regions through which the caravan route passed. He earned his popular Turkish nickname, , meaning &#x27;he who catches clouds&#x27;, an allusion to the Bedouin, who were as elusive as clouds. His less common, Arabic nickname, (&#x27;Ali the demon&#x27;), was similarly a reference to his ferocity against the Bedouin. Upon his return from the Hajj, Ali attained the rank of bey. Ibrahim Ketkhuda died in November 1754, after which he was succeeded as head of the Qazdughli faction by Abd al-Rahman Ketkhuda, while Ridwan succeeded him as . Ridwan was ousted in May 1755, and by October, Uthman Bey al-Jirjawi became and Abd al-Rahman largely retired from politics. Ali became a bey during al-Jirjawi&#x27;s reign.

Al-Jirjawi was ousted by Husayn Bey al-Sabunji, who became and exiled Ali Bey to the village of Nusat in Lower Egypt as part of a purge of potential rivals. In November, al-Sabunji was overthrown in a plot led by Husayn Bey Kashkash, a prominent bey of Ibrahim Ketkhuda&#x27;s household, who recalled Ali Bey from his exile. Another &#x27;Ali Bey&#x27;, known as &#x27;al-Ghazzawi&#x27;, who had also been a mamluk of Ibrahim Ketkhuda, was recalled from his exile as well and was chosen in the council of preeminent beys as the new . While al-Ghazzawi was leading the Hajj caravan in 1760, he attempted to assassinate Abd al-Rahman, who remained influential in his retirement. The plot was detected, after which Abd al-Rahman allied with Ali Bey, who wielded significant influence with the janissaries, to strengthen his position against al-Ghazzawi. In a council of the leading beys held in al-Ghazzawi&#x27;s absence, Abd al-Rahman proposed that Ali Bey replace the acting , Khalil Bey al-Daftardar, to which the council agreed. Upon hearing the election of Ali Bey and a subsequent order to execute the conspirators who attempted to assassinate Abd al-Rahman, Ghazzawi took up exile in Gaza on his way back from the Hajj.

===First term===
Although Ali Bey was officially , Abd al-Rahman, who lived in relative seclusion from daily politics, wielded actual power. Abd al-Rahman was neither a bey nor a mamluk, but a son of a mamluk, who were not favored in the mamluk system for advancement, and used Ali Bey as his political puppet. The limitation of his power by Abd al-Rahman, as well as by the Ottoman governor and the other mamluk beys, did not reconcile with Ali Bey&#x27;s ambitions for total power. He resolved to eliminate his rivals, promote mamluks of his own household and engineer their appointments to powerful positions, and expand his sources of income. He began his thrust for power in 1763, when he exiled several officers of the janissaries from Alexandria and arrested for ransom four priests in Alexandria. The following year, he may have engineered the poisoning death of Egypt&#x27;s incoming governor before he could assume office. In 1765 he exiled Abd al-Rahman to the Hejaz (western Arabia). In the meantime he was rapidly acquiring and promoting his mamluks, such that he had 3,000 mamluks and made eight of them beys by 1766.

===Exile in Gaza===
Ali Bey&#x27;s intensifying moves against the and fellow mamluk emirs and the empowerment of his own mamluks and tyrannical rule all brought about a check on his power by the Ottoman imperial government. It appointed a new governor, Hamza Pasha, with secret instructions to bring down Ali Bey. The governor invited Ali Bey&#x27;s main mamluk rival, Husayn Bey Kishkish, back to Egypt from exile. Ali Bey made an abortive attempt to kill Husayn Bey by poisoning, but the plot was detected and prompted Husayn Bey and Hamza Pasha to retaliate by besieging Ali Bey in his palace. He was forced to step down as . Although he agreed to exile in Medina, he took refuge in Gaza, on Egypt&#x27;s border. In Gaza, Ali Bey established contact with the Acre-based strongman of northern Palestine, Zahir al-Umar, and gained the latter&#x27;s support.

===Second term===
====Return to power====
The tyrannical rule of Khalil Bey and Husayn Bey led to Hamza Pasha facilitating Ali Bey&#x27;s return to Egypt to use him as a check on the ruling beys&#x27; power. On 6 September 1766, Ali Bey and his top mamluks appeared at the Cairo houses of the leading beys and demanded their restoration to the mamluk decision-making council. The council&#x27;s members did not readmit them, but allowed them to stay in Egypt, with Ali Bey banished to Nusat, where he was to live off its revenues, and the others in his party sent to Upper Egypt, where the powerful Hawwara tribe was already hosting several mamluk exiles from the Qasimiya faction under Salih Bey. In February 1767, illicit communications between Ali Bey and his sympathizers in Cairo were detected, leading to the killings or exile of the sympathizers by the ruling beys and an order to exile Ali Bey to Jeddah. Around the same time, however, Hamza Pasha moved against the mamluks, per orders from Constantinople. Although several beys were slain and Husayn Bey was wounded, the mamluks prevailed against the governor, whom they deposed. 

The imperial government soon after sent a new governor, Rakım Mehmed Pasha, with orders to rein in the beys and prop up Ali Bey. Despite the threat he posed to them, Ali Bey was allowed by his mamluk rivals in power to join his mamluks in exile at Asyut in Upper Egypt. There, the leader of the Hawwara, Sheikh Humam, brokered an alliance between Ali Bey and Salih Bey. The two now rebelled against Husayn Bey and Khalil Bey by blocking traffic along the Nile River, preventing food supplies to Cairo from Upper Egypt, and stopping tax payments from the Upper Egyptian districts. After abortive expeditions from the ruling mamluks against Ali Bey and Salih Bey, the latter two launched their offensive, appearing before Cairo in autumn 1767. Rakım Mehmed Pasha, intent on toppling the beys, ordered the back to their barracks, thus depriving Husayn Bey and Khalil Bey of crucial military support. Without any actual fighting, Ali Bey and Salih Bey entered Cairo in October, while Khalil Bey and Husayn Bey left for Gaza. Rakım Mehmed Pasha recognized Ali Bey as and restored his subordinate beys to their former offices.

====Elimination of rivals and advancement of allies====
Soon after, Ali Bey launched a campaign to eliminate his rivals. On 30 November 1767 he assassinated two top-ranking mamluks, Ali Bey Jinn and Hasan Bey, and followed it up by expelling from Egypt four other beys and their retinues. On 1 March 1768, he exiled some thirty officers, including eighteen high-ranking mamluks of his ally Salih Bey&#x27;s household. In May, Husayn Bey and Khalil Bey launched a campaign against Ali Bey from Gaza, sweeping through the Nile Delta, before establishing base in Tanta. Ali Bey obtained a firman from Rakım Mehmed Pasha officially declaring them as rebels, enabling him to use imperial funds against them, though he still imposed heavy exactions on the local and foreign merchants toward the same purpose. Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab and Salih Bey, confronted the rebels, who surrendered after running out of ammunition. Husayn Bey was beheaded, while Khalil Bey took refuge in the Sayyid Tantawi Mosque until Ali Bey permitted him to enter exile in Alexandria. There, in July 1768, he was strangled. For the remainder of the year, Ali Bey continued eliminating or substantially weakening rivals among the mamluks and in the ranks of the , especially the janissaries, who remained the only influential government military force in the province. By September, the French consul reported &quot;never has the Janissary been reduced to the point it is today&quot;. That month, Ali Bey had Salih Bey assassinated, and soon after broke up his household, exiling his mamluks to Tanta, Damietta, Jeddah, and Upper Egypt. 

With every move against his rivals, Ali Bey consolidated his hold over the military and bureaucracy in Egypt. All of the officers he eliminated were replaced by his own mamluks. He allowed the beys from his household to build up households of their own, while he acquired substantial numbers of new mamluks and commissioned mercenaries to supplement his forces. After Salih Bey&#x27;s assassination, Ali Bey promoted three more of his mamluks as beys, appointed Isma&#x27;il Bey as defterdar, Ayyub Bey as governor of the major district of Girga, and another of his mamluk beys, Hasan Bey Ridwan, as and (commander of Cairo). In September, he had assumed the office of , thereby attaining the executive powers of the governor during his absence. Crecelius notes by &quot;combining the leadership of the mamluk regime with the executive functions of the Ottoman government Ali Bey had gained complete mastery of the Ottoman administration and reduced the governor to impotence&quot;. Rakım Mehmed Pasha attempted to depose Ali Bey in November by enlisting Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab. The latter revealed the plot to Ali Bey, who then denounced and ousted the governor.

Ali Bey stopped the annual tribute to the Sublime Porte and in an unprecedented usurpation of the Ottoman Sultan&#x27;s privileges had his name struck on local coins in 1769 (alongside the sultan&#x27;s emblem), effectively declaring Egypt&#x27;s independence from Ottoman rule. In 1770 he gained control of the Hijaz and a year later temporarily occupied Syria, thereby reconstituting the Mamluk state that had disappeared in 1517. However, a few days after a major victory over Governor Uthman Pasha al-Kurji by the allied forces of Zahir al-Umar and Ali Bey&#x27;s forces on 6 June 1771, Abu al-Dhahab, the commander of his troops in Syria, refused to continue the fight after an Ottoman agent stirred up mistrust between him and Ali Bey, and hastily returned to Egypt. As a result, Ali Bey lost power in 1772. The following year, he was killed in Cairo.

However, the date of 1772 is highly disputed; other sources and historians give varying dates for the end of Ali Bey&#x27;s power in Egypt. Uzunçarşılı claims that he held power until 1773 (when Kara Halil Pasha became governor), but &quot;Sicill-i Osmani&quot; disagrees, saying that he fell out of power in 1769 and naming three interceding governors by name between the end of Ali Bey&#x27;s reign in 1769 and Kara Halil Pasha&#x27;s appointment in 1773; these are Köprülü Hafız Ahmed Pasha (1769), Kelleci Osman Pasha (1769–1771), and Vekil Osman Pasha (1772–1773). First-person source Al-Jabarti declares that Ali Bey gave up power in 1769 when a new governor from the Ottoman capital of Istanbul was assigned by the sultan (although he doesn&#x27;t name him). It is likely that Uzunçarşılı read Al-Jabarti&#x27;s chronicle, but failed to note the narrative about the new governor coming from Istanbul in 1769, since after that, Al-Jabarti does not name any other pasha by name or sequence until 1773 with Kara Halil Pasha.

===Economic policies===
According to historians Cleveland and Bunton, &quot;During his time in power, he successfully expanded Egypt&#x27;s trade with Britain and France. He also hired European advisers to the military and bought European weapons&quot;. However, according to Bidwell, &quot;...he did not make use of native Egyptians or call in foreigners for technical advice. He made no effort to build a modern army...&quot;

<text>The history of Irish theatre begins in the Middle Ages and was for a long time confined to the courts of the Gaelic and &quot;Old English&quot; – descendants of 12th-century Norman invaders – inhabitants of Ireland. The first theatre building in Ireland was the Werburgh Street Theatre, founded in 1637, followed by the Smock Alley Theatre in 1662.

From the 17th century, theatrical productions in Ireland tended to serve the political purposes of the English colonial administration, but as more theatres opened and the popular audience grew, a more diverse range of entertainments were staged. Many Dublin-based theatres developed links with their London equivalents and performers and productions from the British capital frequently found their way to the Irish stage. However, almost all Irish playwrights from William Congreve to George Bernard Shaw found it necessary to leave their native island to establish themselves.

At the beginning of the 20th century, theatres and theatre companies dedicated to the staging of Irish plays and the development of indigenous writers, directors and performers began to emerge. This allowed many of the most significant Irish dramatists to learn their trade and establish their reputations in Ireland rather than in Great Britain or the United States.

==Historic theatre buildings==
Few historic theatre buildings survive in Ireland, and only a small minority predate the 20th century. The Gaiety Theatre in Dublin dates to 1871, and despite multiple alterations it retains several Victorian era features and remains Ireland&#x27;s longest-established, continuously producing public theatre. The Theatre Royal, Waterford dates to 1876, but retains some structural material from the 1785 theatre building which preceded it, and is considered Ireland&#x27;s oldest continually operating theatre. The Smock Alley Theatre was converted, in 2012, from an early 19th century church building which incorporated fabric from the 18th century theatre which preceded it, and is built on the foundations of the first Theatre Royal from 1662. It is thus often referred to as Ireland&#x27;s &quot;oldest new theatre&quot; or &quot;newest old theatre&quot;. The Lord Amiens Theatre was built as a private theatre wing of Aldborough House in 1795, and used as such until 1830. Despite alterations to the interior, structurally the building remains exactly as it was designed and first constructed, and it is thus considered the oldest purpose-built theatre building in Ireland.

==Small beginnings==
Although there would appear to have been performances of plays on religious themes in Ireland from as early as the 14th century, the first well-documented instance of a theatrical production in Ireland is a 1601 staging of &quot;Gorboduc&quot; presented by Lord Mountjoy Lord Deputy of Ireland in the Great Hall in Dublin Castle. The play had been written by Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton for the 1561/2 Christmas festivities at the Inner Temple in London and appears to have been selected because it was a story of a divided kingdom descending into anarchy that was applicable to the situation in Ireland at the time of the performance. Mountjoy started a fashion, and private performances became quite commonplace in great houses all over Ireland over the following thirty years.

The Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin is generally identified as the &quot;first custom-built theatre in the city,&quot; &quot;the only pre-Restoration playhouse outside London,&quot; and the &quot;first Irish playhouse.&quot;

==Court in Kilkenny==
In 1642, as a result of the English Civil War, Dublin Royalists were forced to flee the city. Many of them went to Kilkenny to join a confederacy of Old English and Irish that formed in that city. Kilkenny had a tradition of dramatic performance going back to 1366, and the Dublin company, much attenuated, set up in their new home. At least one new play was published in Kilkenny; &quot;A Tragedy of Cola&#x27;s Fury, OR, Lirenda&#x27;s Misery&quot;, a blatantly political work with the Lirenda of the title being an anagram of Ireland.

With the restoration of the monarchy in 1661, John Ogilby was commissioned to design the triumphal arches and write masques for the new king&#x27;s entrance into London. Ogilby was reinstated as Master of the Revels and returned to Dublin to open a new theatre in Smock Alley. Although starting well, this new theatre was essentially under the control of the administration in Dublin Castle and staged mainly pro-Stuart works and Shakespearean classics. As a result, Irish playwrights and actors of real talent were drawn to London.

==The Restoration==
An early example of this trend is William Congreve, one of the most important writers for the late 18th London stage. Although born in Yorkshire, Congreve grew up in Ireland and studied with Jonathan Swift in Kilkenny and at Trinity College Dublin. After graduating, Congreve moved to London to study law at the Temple and pursue a literary career. His first play, &quot;The Old Bachelor&quot; (1693) was sponsored by John Dryden, and he went on to write at least four more plays. The last of these, &quot;The Way of the World&quot; (1700) is the one Congreve work regularly revived on the modern stage. However, at the time of its creation, it was a relative failure and he wrote no further works for the theatre.

With the accession to the throne of William of Orange, the whole ethos of Dublin Castle, including its attitude to the theatre, changed. A theatre at Smock Alley stayed in existence until the 1780s and new theatres, such as the Theatre Royal, Queens&#x27; Theatre, and The Gaiety Theatre opened during the 19th century. However, the one constant for the next 200 years was that the main action in the history of Irish theatre happened outside Ireland itself, mainly in London.

==18th century==

The 18th century saw the emergence of two major Irish dramatists, Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who were two of the most successful playwrights on the London stage in the 18th century. Goldsmith (1728–1774) was born in Roscommon and grew up in extremely rural surroundings. He entered Trinity College in 1745 and graduated in 1749. He returned to the family home, and in 1751, began to travel, finally settling in London in 1756, where he published poetry, prose and two plays, &quot;The Good-Natur&#x27;d Man&quot; 1768 and &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; 1773. This latter was a huge success and is still regularly revived.

Sheridan (1751–1816) was born in Dublin into a family with a strong literary and theatrical tradition. His mother was a writer and his father was manager of Smock Alley Theatre. The family moved to England in the 1750s, and Sheridan attended Harrow Public School. His first play, &quot;The Rivals&quot; 1775, was performed at Covent Garden and was an instant success. He went on to become the most significant London playwright of the late 18th century with plays like &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and &quot;The Critic&quot;. He was owner of the Drury Lane Theatre, which he bought from David Garrick. The theatre burned down in 1809, and Sheridan lived out the rest of his life in reduced circumstances. He is buried in Poets&#x27; Corner at Westminster Abbey.

==19th century==
After Sheridan, the next Irish dramatist of historical importance was Dion Boucicault (1820–1890). Boucicault was born in Dublin but went to England to complete his education. At school, he began writing dramatic sketches and soon took up acting under the stage name of Lee Morton. His first play was &quot;Legend of Devil&#x27;s Dyke&quot; 1838 in which he acted himself in Brighton. His first London production was &quot;London Assurance&quot; 1841. This was a great success and he seemed set to become the major writer of comedies of his day. However, his next few plays were not as successful and Boucicault found himself in debt. He recovered some of his reputation with &quot;The Corsican Brothers&quot; (1852), a well constructed melodrama.

In 1853, he moved to New York, where he soon became a hit with plays like &quot;The Poor of New York&quot; (1857), &quot;Dot&quot; (1859, based on Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot;) and &quot;The Octoroon&quot; (1859). These plays tackled issues such as urban poverty and slavery. Boucicault was also involved in getting the 1856 law on copyright passed through Congress. His last New York play was &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot; (1860). In that year, Boucicault returned to London to stage &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot; and the play ran for 247 performances at The Adelphi Theatre. He wrote several more successful plays, including &quot;The Shaughran&quot; (1875) and &quot;Robert Emmet&quot; (1884). These later plays helped perpetuate the stereotype of the drunken, hotheaded, garrulous Irishman that had been common on the British stage since the time of Shakespeare. Other Irish dramatists of the period include John Banim and Gerald Griffin, whose novel &quot;The Collegians &quot; formed the basis for &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot;.

Boucicault is widely regarded as the wittiest Irish dramatist between Sheridan and Oscar Wilde (1854–1900). Wilde was born in Dublin into a literary family and studied at Trinity College, where he had a brilliant career. In 1874 he won a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford. Here he began his career as a writer, winning the Newdigate Prize for his poem &quot;Ravenna&quot;. His studies were cut short during his second year at Oxford when his father died leaving large debts.

During a short but glittering literary career, Wilde wrote poetry, short stories, criticism and a novel, but his plays probably represent his most enduring legacy. Wilde&#x27;s first stage success came with &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1892), which resulted in his becoming the most talked about dramatist in London. He followed this up with &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; (1893), &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; (1895) and his most famous play &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; that same year.

With these plays, Wilde came to dominate late-Victorian era British theatre. His plays are noted for the lightness of their wit, but he also contrived to address some serious issues around sexual and class roles and identity, as he wrote himself &#x27;treating the serious things lightly and the light things seriously&#x27;. Events in Wilde&#x27;s personal life were to overtake his literary success and he died in Paris in 1900. He remains one of the great figures in the history of Irish theatre and his plays are frequently performed all over the English-speaking world.

Wilde&#x27;s contemporary George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) was a very different kind of writer. Born in Dublin, Shaw moved to London in 1876 intending to become a novelist. Here he became active in socialist politics and became a member of the Fabian Society. He was also a very public vegetarian. His writing for the stage was influenced by Henrik Ibsen. His early political plays were not popular, but he made a breakthrough with &quot;John Bull&#x27;s Other Island&quot; (1904). Shaw was extremely prolific, and his collected writings filled 36 volumes. Many of his plays are now forgotten, but a number, including &quot;Major Barbara&quot;, &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (usually considered his masterpiece) and &quot;Pygmalion &quot; are still regularly performed. &quot;Pygmalion &quot; was the basis for the movie &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, a fact which benefitted the National Gallery of Ireland as Shaw had left the royalties of the play to the gallery. A statue of the playwright now stands outside the gallery entrance. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925.

==20th and 21st centuries==

===The Abbey and after===
A sea change in the history of the Irish theatre came with the establishment in Dublin in 1899 of the Irish Literary Theatre by W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, George Moore and Edward Martyn. This was followed by the Irish National Theatre Society, later to become the Abbey Theatre. The history of this theatre is well documented, and its importance can be seen from the list of writers whose plays were first performed here in the early days of the 20th century. These included W. B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, John Millington Synge, George Moore, and Seán O&#x27;Casey. Equally importantly, through the introduction by Yeats, via Ezra Pound, of elements of the Noh theatre of Japan, a tendency to mythologise quotidian situations, and a particularly strong focus on writings in dialects of Hiberno-English, the Abbey was to create a style that held a strong fascination for future Irish dramatists. Indeed, it could almost be said that the Abbey created the basic elements of a national theatrical style.

This period also saw a rise in the writing of plays in Irish, especially after the formation, in 1928, of An Taidhbhearc, a theatre dedicated to the Irish language. The Gate Theatre, also founded in 1928 under the direction of Hilton Edwards and Micheál MacLiammóir, introduced Irish audiences to many of the classics of the European stage.

===Mid-20th century===
The twentieth century saw a number of Irish playwrights come to prominence. Samuel Beckett is probably the most significant of these. Beckett had a long career as a novelist and poet before his first play, &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; (1953) made him famous. This play, along with his second, &quot;Endgame&quot;, is one of the great works of absurdist theatre. Beckett was awarded for the Nobel Prize in 1969.

The Lyric Theatre, founded in 1944 by Austin Clarke was based in the Abbey until 1951 and produced many of Clarke&#x27;s own verse plays. From the mid-1950s, the Unitarian Church at St Stephen&#x27;s Green, Dublin was home to Amharclann an Damer/The Damer Theatre. The Damer produced both professional and amateur Irish language theatre. The world premier of Brendan Behan&#x27;s &quot;An Giall&quot; (&quot;The Hostage&quot;) took place here in 1958. The theatre closed in 1981. Behan went on to be an extremely popular dramatist, particularly through his work with Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Royal in Stratford, East London.

Other important Irish dramatists of this period include: Denis Johnston, Thomas Kilroy, Tom Murphy, Hugh Leonard, Frank McGuinness, and John B. Keane.

===Recent developments===
In general, the Abbey was the dominant influence in theatre in Ireland across the 20th century. Beckett&#x27;s example has been almost entirely ignored, although his plays are regularly performed on the Irish stage. Behan, in his use of song and direct address to the audience, was influenced by Bertolt Brecht and Denis Johnston used modernist techniques including found texts and collage, but their works had little impact on the dramatists who came after them. In the 1970s and 1980s, a number of companies emerged to challenge the Abbey&#x27;s dominance and introduce different styles and approaches. These included Focus Theatre, The Passion Machine, The Children&#x27;s T Company, the Project Theatre Company, Red Kettle, Druid Theatre, TEAM and Field Day. These companies nurtured a number of writers, actors, and directors who went on to be successful in London, Broadway and Hollywood or in other literary fields. These include Enda Walsh, Joe O Byrne, Peter Sheridan, Brian Friel, Stephen Rea, Garry Hynes, Martin McDonagh, Conor McPherson, Marina Carr, Jimmy Murphy, Billy Roche and Gabriel Byrne. In 1974 Siamsa Tíre, the National Folk Theatre of Ireland, was founded in Tralee, County Kerry, by Pat Ahern.

In the 1990s and 2000s a new wave of theatre companies arrived. These include: Barabbas, Barnstorm Theatre Company, Bedrock, Blue Raincoat, B*spoke, The Corn Exchange, Corcadorca, Fishamble, KATS Theatre Group, Loose Canon, Ouroborous and Pan Pan. A number of these companies had a significant portion or, in some cases, all of their Arts Council funding cut at the beginning of 2010 and it remains to be seen if they will continue to operate.

==Theatre in the Irish language==
Irish-language theatre has enjoyed periods of remarkable productivity since its beginnings in the era of the Gaelic Revival, despite a frequent lack of trained actors and directors, a small and scattered audience and difficulty in finding permanent theatre spaces.

The earliest plays were often based on folk themes or had as their aim the strengthening of nationalism. It was not until the late nineteen twenties that a real sophistication began to be achieved, and even then the work depended largely on the work of gifted amateurs working through dramatic societies and the few available theatres. They were handicapped by the lack of a longstanding dramatic tradition such as existed in English, and it has been argued that, with outstanding exceptions, there was little influence at the time from the European classics.

From 1942 the Abbey Theatre began occasional productions in Irish; in time this led to a concentration on pantomime at the expense of longer and more serious work. New theatre companies emerged to redress this, and An Phéacóg Nua (The New Peacock Theatre), a small theatre specialising in Irish-language drama, was created as an extension of the Abbey. The task of presenting innovative theatre in Irish was taken up by An Damer, a theatre in the heart of Dublin. It continued the tradition of staging both original work and translations. There were professional directors working there, and the playwrights included Eoghan Ó Tuairisc, Seán Ó Tuama, Brendan Behan and Máiréad Ní Ghráda. It served as a training ground for actors like Niall Tóibín who achieved distinction elesewhere. It lost its state subsidy in 1981 and closed, and the new theatre companies that arose to replace it lacked a permanent home.

The Taibhdhearc, a Galway theatre founded in 1928, was explicitly devoted to Irish-language productions. Prominent among those involved were the writer and actor Micheál MacLiammóir and his companion Hilton Edwards, who were also involved with the Gate Theatre in Dublin. The Taibhdhearc has over the years mounted critically praised productions, but there was always tension between proponents of original and translated drama. There was a constant need for new scripts and for sufficient funding to establish the Taibhdhearc as a national theatre. The number of full-length plays in Irish being presented there is presently at a minimum.

Irish-language theatre still depends upon a mixture of amateur and professional talent. Current companies include Aisteoirí Bulfin, Fíbín (with an emphasis on physicality and the visual, including masks and puppetry) and the Belfast group Aisling Ghéar, with an interest in experimentation. Dublin, traditionally a theatrical centre, still lacks a permanent theatre devoted solely to Irish-language productions, though the Peacock Theatre continues to present plays in Irish.
In the words of Irish theatre historian Philip O’Leary, &quot;theatre in Irish has been a living if often invisible art form, with its companies, venues, prizes and, of course, critics&quot;. In spite of its problems, it shows continuing vitality.

<text>Miturgidae is a family of araneomorph spiders that includes nearly 170 species in 29 genera worldwide. First described by Eugène Simon in 1886, it has been substantially revised, and includes the previous family Zoridae as a synonym, and excludes the family Xenoctenidae. Several genera have also been removed, such as the large genus &quot;Cheiracanthium&quot;, which was transferred to the Cheiracanthiidae.

<text>Daniil Borisovich Shafran (, January 13, 1923February 7, 1997) was a Soviet Russian cellist.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Daniil Shafran was born in Petrograd (later Leningrad, then Saint Petersburg) in 1923 to a Jewish family. Even from before his birth he was surrounded by music. His mother and father were music students when he was born. His father, Boris Shafran, went on to be principal cellist of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra and his mother, Frida Moiseyevna, was a pianist. He recounted how, as his mother went into labour, his father was practicing passages from Haydn&#x27;s D major Concerto in preparation for a recital, and was reluctant to go to the hospital until he had mastered a difficult technical passage.

Shafran was initially taught by his father, whom he had long begged for lessons. When aged eight and a half, &quot;my father met me brandishing a small cello. &#x27;I bought you a cello&#x27;, he cried. &#x27;Sit down and we&#x27;ll start studying. His father was a serious musician and strict teacher and after year and a half under his tutelage, Shafran had absorbed many of the values that he held throughout his life: diligent and regular practice and the importance of striving for the highest goals. A key principle established was to overcome technical obstacles by learning to play far beyond the demands of the work, and Shafran learned to be &quot;mercilessly strict with myself when practicing&quot;.

When he was ten years old (other sources say eight), his father took him to Alexander Shtrimer (1888–1961), then professor at the Leningrad Conservatory, for lessons. Initially this was at the Conservatory Special Music School for Children, where Shtrimer also taught, and then at the Conservatory itself where Shafran was one of ten talented children chosen to attend. Shafran remained with Shtrimer for more than ten years (into his early twenties). Though his father took a more active interest in his progress than might be &quot;correct in terms of pedagogical ethics&quot;, he took no other teacher, commenting that &quot;my own experiences and my association with my musician colleagues were all a &#x27;second teacher&#x27; to me&quot;.
Shafran&#x27;s first public performance was at the age of 10, at one of the Conservatory concerts, where he played two technically demanding works by David Popper: &#x27;Spinning Song&#x27; and &#x27;Elfentanz&#x27;. His orchestral debut was a year later, when 11, when he played Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Rococo Variations&quot; with the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under the visiting British conductor, Albert Coates.

At the age of 14, Shafran entered the 1937 USSR All-Union Competition for Violinists and Cellists, for young musicians from all Soviet states. Although strictly he was below the qualifying age limit, he was allowed to enter as an unofficial contestant and carried off the first prize. His age, &quot;filigree virtuosity and poetic appearance had caused something of a sensation&quot; and Shafran achieved national prominence. Shafran was also awarded a magnificent Antonio Amati cello as part of the prize.
Musical activity in Leningrad was heavily impacted by the Second World War. Among many other activities in Russia, the All-Union competition was suspended for 7 years. Only in 1945 was it held again, when the war in Russia was over, and this time the winner was the young Mstislav Rostropovich. By 1949, &quot;Shafran’s supremacy as the country&#x27;s leading young cellist was now being challenged by Rostropovich, four years his junior.&quot; Shafran and Rostropovich both entered the 1949 competition at the Festival of Democratic Youth, Budapest, and they tied for the first prize. David Oistrakh, a jury member at the competition, wrote &quot;both cellists are complete masters of cello sound. Their light virtuosity and elegant technique should be the envy of many violinists&quot;.

The following year Shafran and Rostropovich again met in competition, at the Wihan contest in Prague – an event to commemorate the centenary of the Bohemian Cellist Hanus Wihan (1850–1920), himself a pupil of Karl Davydov. Shafran performed the &quot;Rococo Variations&quot; in the final round, (which by his own admission, he had not played successfully), and yet, again, Shafran and Rostropovich were the joint prize-winners.
When Shafran graduated from the Conservatory in 1950, he was now 27 years old, and Rostropovich 23. For almost a decade, they stood out as the two outstanding young Russian cellists. &quot;Both had already achieved an extraordinary level of artistry, yet they were temperamentally very different. Shafran&#x27;s attention to detail made him pre-eminent in miniature forms: his poetic sensibility and the remarkable palette of tone colours he had at his disposal suit him to romantic and impressionistic repertoire&quot;. But in large forms, the musician&#x27;s achievements were no less great.

===Concert career===
Shafran pursued a career as soloist and recorded very widely. His repertoire included the major concertos, music for cello and piano, and the solo cello repertoire. His astonishing technique in the higher register enabled him to perform a wide range of violin works at original pitch. He also sought to enrich the cello repertoire, and made and performed transcriptions of works for other instruments. However, he rarely toured outside the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc, and virtually all his recordings were for the Melodiya label, so his international reputation was very limited.

In 1950, Shafran moved to Moscow, separating him from his family and his teacher on whom he had depended for so long - an event which caused him an artistic crisis. His early career was, in his own observation &quot;rather hard. I made blunders, but this is only natural&quot;. Like so many prodigies, Shafran needed to develop into a mature artist, and his first wife and recital partner, Nina Musinian, greatly helped him in this respect, encouraging him to break with his past, and find the space to experiment.

His early concerts and recordings show his stature. His first recording, at age 14, was of the &quot;Rococo Variations&quot;. In 1946 he performed in Rumania with George Enescu at the piano. In 1954 he recorded Kabalevsky&#x27;s First cello Concerto, under the baton of the composer. Kabalevsky was sufficiently impressed that he dedicated his Second Cello Concerto to Shafran, who gave the premiere and made the first recording in 1965. In 1956 he made a &quot;legendary recording&quot; of the Shostakovich Cello Sonata, with the composer at the piano. He observed that &quot;No matter what I asked or suggested ... Shostakovich listened to every word ... and agreed to any new details ... even those that went against his original notation in the score&quot;, highlighting not only Shostakovich&#x27;s character, but Shafran&#x27;s confidence in his own musical vision. In 1962 he performed the Khachaturian Cello Concerto under the direction of the composer.

Shafran made a number of concert tours and recordings together with his first wife, pianist Nina Musinian. Later on, he formed a long-lasting partnership with the pianist Anton Ginsburg.

Shafran&#x27;s American debut was in 1960 in Carnegie Hall, at which concert he met Osip Shtrimer, the brother of his teacher. His British premiere was not till 1964, with concerts in Wigmore Hall and the Royal Festival Hall. He visited Japan several times, and toured Australia. By the time the Berlin Wall fell, Shafran&#x27;s concert career was nearing its end.

===Interpretation and technique===
Shafran had a poetic and sincere way of performing music. His vibrato, phrasing and virtuosity all added to his distinctively passionate performances. Characteristic of his style was his inimitable rich tone (unusual on a baroque instrument), his unlimited musical freedom, and his impeccable technical proficiency.

Shafran saw himself as a product of a Leningrad (rather than a Moscow) tradition that “attached great importance to technical matters, [but] gave more attention to interpretation, revealing the stylistic diversity of works, and developing the artistic propensities of the pupil”.
Structured and disciplined practice was the foundation of his playing. “A small minority of string players can get by without constant practice, but I admit that I am not one”, he noted. Each day would start with a slow cantilena piece for about 15 minutes, “to refresh the reflexes” for tonal beauty. From his father, he learned to play a piece through at twice the written speed, to ensure that all technical challenges were met. “I must work and persevere without pause. And if there comes a time when I feel some element of my instrumental control is slipping, I immediately start exercises to rectify the situation. For the left hand… I execute great leaps over the fingerboard with all fingers, striving for exactness of intonation and purity of sound.” To develop tone control, he would take a piece of moderate difficulty, like Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &#x27;Vocalise&#x27;, and play it high on the C-string instead of the A-string.

While having great technical mastery, Shafran saw technique as a means rather than an end. Although he followed David Oistrakh&#x27;s advice “to include a virtuoso piece in your daily dozen: the audience likes them as a reward” and he highly recommend practicing the “old bravura works for those who aspire to attain the heights of cello technique”, for himself he felt that above all his music should be sincere, and he aimed to focus on “major music” with the depth for great expression. “I do detest and avoid music which is patently inferior or &#x27;cheap&#x27;. When I encounter a work that does not immediately enthuse me, I always seek to discover something that may be hidden in its pages. If the work seems to lack profundity or expressiveness, I strive to compensate for this by instilling it with my own enthusiasm and imagination, and seek out the work&#x27;s dramaturgic accents based on the general character of the music.

Shafran was mercilessly strict with himself, and his partners: “from first note to last, I cannot permit my partner&#x27;s playing to sabotage my intentions”, but he was not dogmatic: “everything is permissible if it sounds beautiful, if it is justified artistically”.

He felt fingering should not be rigid or dogmatic, but must be subordinated to bringing out the content and expressiveness of a work. Noting that a player has a choice of many fingering combinations, he said the “selection must be geared to our own personal hand structure, stretch, finger length, flexibility, etc., and the instrument, too, must be taken into account”. He frequently employed what he called “revolutionary” fingerings, possible only because “every finger was well-trained and obedient”.

He developed a number of unusual technical features. He used the thumb and fourth finger extensively, throughout the compass of the cello, and his large hand combined with the diminutive Amati cello that he always played allowed him to make very large stretches and play octaves between thumb and 3rd finger, and also 1st and 4th fingers. His range of vibrato was unusually wide, grading from fine and violin-like through to a distinctive wide, pulsating and operatic throb. He achieved a very light staccato and spiccato, and he made his beautiful silvery sound using the bow at the tip far more than most cellists and liked the hair to be on the loose side. His bowing appeared rather like a violinist, very light and without effort, yet at the same time very intense.

In performance, his style was individual. He rehearsed in full concert dress, perched at the front of an unusually high chair, positioned on a little raised platform, and played with his eyes closed. His ritual preparation for concerts included early morning practice, eating, relaxation and mental preparation.

The cellist Steven Isserlis summed up that “as a cellist and musician, Shafran was unlike anyone else. At a time in which, thanks to various media, musical styles are converging, Shafran&#x27;s voice remained apart. His vibrato, his phrasing, his rhythm all belonged to a unique whole; his astounding virtuosity conveyed a musical personality that retained the passion, the simplicity and the poetry of a great Russian folk singer. He was incapable of playing one note insincerely; his music spoke from the soul”.

The pianist Sviatoslav Richter stated:&quot;a brief association with the cellist Daniil Shafran gave me little pleasure. He was a great cellist, with a distinctive tone, but whenever he played, you always had the impression that he was thinking only of the moment when he would have an interesting high note that he could hold on to and produce an attractive sound. He also suffered from nerves. I stopped performing with him in 1951 and he then joined up with Grigory Ginzburg... As a musician, if not a cellist, Rostropovitch was incomparably more interesting, an artist of far greater stature. He dwarfed him completely.&quot;

===Shafran&#x27;s Amati cello===
Unusually for a major cellist, Shafran played the same instrument throughout his life. He formed an unbreakable bond with the Antonio Amati cello that he won at the age of 14, and always played on it.

The cello is described as dating from 1630. The exact dates of Antonio Amati (son of Andrea Amati, and the elder of the two Brothers Amati) are not known for certain, being variously reported between 1540 and 1607 and 1555 to 1640. Sources such as Cozio report that the entire span of Antonio Amati&#x27;s working life was 1588–1628. It is by all accounts a magnificent instrument, though somewhat smaller than full size. It has been questioned whether &quot;any Amati, no matter how fine, is sufficiently powerful for a solo cellist at the summit of his career. Baroque instruments of that period would not normally have the power of a later master.&quot; However, Shafran&#x27;s recordings give no hint that the Amati has any lack of power. On the other hand, any Amati surviving into the present time has been rebuilt in the neck to allow for a higher bridge, and these alterations would give the instrument more carrying power and a brighter, more piercing sound than it had in the original baroque setup. The use of metal strings at high tension would also add to the brighter sound.

Shafran, who was known for his sometimes remarkably individual fingerings, denied that they would only work for his hand and on a cello of this size: &quot;Any cellist with a normal stretch can use my fingerings on a standard sized cello, though they would, of course, be more difficult for a cellist with a small finger stretch&quot;.

Daniil Shafran died in Moscow on February 7, 1997, aged 74. In September 1997, his widow, Svetlana Shafran, donated the Amati cello to the Glinka Museum.

<text>Pauline Cushman (born Harriet Wood; June 10, 1833 – December 2, 1893) was an American actress and a spy for the Union Army during the American Civil War. She is considered one of the most successful Civil War spies.

==Early life==

Harriet Wood, who later adopted the stage name of Pauline Cushman, was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on June 10, 1833, the daughter of a Spanish merchant and a Frenchwoman (daughter of one of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s soldiers). Harriet and her brother William were raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Her parents moved there to establish a trading post with indigenous peoples. In 1862, she made her stage debut in Louisville, Kentucky, a Union-occupied city. Later, she would travel to New York where she would take the stage name Pauline Cushman. Over the course of her life, Cushman was married to Jere Fryer, Charles C. Dickinson, and August Fichtner. She had three children: Charles, Ida, and an adopted daughter, Emma.

==Career as a spy==
After a Northern performance, Cushman was paid by two local pro-Confederate men to toast Confederate President Jefferson Davis after the performance. The theatre company forced her to quit, but she had other ideas. She had decided to ingratiate herself with the rebels by making the toast, while offering her services to the Union as a spy. 

By fraternizing with rebel military commanders, she managed to conceal battle plans and drawings in her shoes, but was caught twice in 1864 and brought before Confederate General Braxton Bragg, tried by a military court, and sentenced to death by hanging. Though she was already ill, she acted worse off than she was. The Confederates had to postpone her execution. Cushman was spared hanging by the invasion of the area by Union troops. She was also wounded twice. 

Some reports state that she returned to the South in her role as a spy, dressed in male uniform. She was awarded the rank of brevet major by General James A. Garfield, and made an honorary major by President Abraham Lincoln for her service to the Federal cause, and became known as &quot;Miss Major Pauline Cushman.&quot; By the end of the war in 1865, she was touring the country giving lectures on her exploits as a spy.

==Later life ==
Because her undercover activities on behalf of the government were secret, there is a lack of corroborative information about her life at this time. After the war, however, she began a tour celebrating her experiences as a Union spy, working at one point with P. T. Barnum. In 1865, a friend, Ferdinand Sarmiento, wrote an exaggerated biography titled &quot;The Life of Pauline Cushman: The celebrated Union Spy and Scout,&quot; detailing her early history, her entry into the secret service, notes, and memoranda.

She lost her child to sickness by 1868, and married again in 1872 in San Francisco, but was widowed within a year. Sources state that in 1879 she met Jere Fryer, and moved to Casa Grande, Arizona Territory, where they married and operated a hotel and livery stable. Jere Fryer became the sheriff of Pinal County. Their adopted daughter, Emma, died on April 17, 1888, at 6 years old of a seizure. As a result, the Fryers separated in 1890. 

By 1892, she was living in poverty in El Paso, Texas. She had applied for back pension based on her first husband&#x27;s military service which she received in the amount of $12 per month beginning in June 1893 . Her last few years were spent in a boarding house in San Francisco, working as a seamstress and charwoman. Disabled from the effects of rheumatism and arthritis, she developed an addiction to pain medication, and on the night of 2 December 1893 she took a suicidal overdose of morphine. She was found the next morning by her landlady.

==Death and legacy==
She died as Pauline Fryer at the age of sixty. The time of her Civil War fame was recalled at her funeral, which was arranged by members of the Grand Army of the Republic; Cushman was buried with full military honors. &quot;Major&quot; Cushman&#x27;s remains now rest in Officer&#x27;s Circle at the Presidio&#x27;s National Cemetery. Her simple gravestone recognizes her contribution to the Union&#x27;s victory. It is marked, &quot;Pauline C. Fryer, Union Spy.&quot;

In 1961, the television series &quot;Rawhide&quot; aired an episode, &quot;The Blue Spy&quot; with Pauline Cushman as the central character, portrayed by veteran actress Phyllis Thaxter.

A road at Fort Ritchie, Maryland a now decommissioned Army Post, was named in her honor.

<text>A knit cap, colloquially known as a beanie, is a piece of knitted headwear designed to provide warmth in cold weather. It usually has a simple tapered shape, although more elaborate variants exist. Historically made of wool, it is now often made of synthetic fibers.

Found all over the world where the climate demands warm clothing, knit caps are known by a variety of local names. In American English, this type of hat is known as a &quot;beanie&quot; or a &quot;watch cap&quot;, while in Canadian English, a knit cap is known as a &quot;&quot;, or (pronounced ).

==Construction==
Most knit caps are tapered at the top. The stretch of the knitting itself hugs the head, keeping the cap secure. They are sometimes topped with a pom-pom or loose tassels. Knit caps may have a folded brim, or none, and may be worn tightly fitting the head or loose on top. A South American tradition from the Andes Mountains is for the cap to have ear flaps, with strings for tying under the chin. A special type of cap called a balaclava folds down over the head with openings for just the face or for the eyes or mouth only.

Some modern variants are constructed as a parallel-sided tube, with a draw-string closure at one end. This version can be worn as a neck-warmer with the draw-string loose and open, or as a hat with the draw-string pulled tight and closed.

== Other names and history ==
Dating from the 15th century, the earliest type of knitted wool cap was produced in the Welsh town of Monmouth.

The earliest surviving example of a &quot;Monmouth cap&quot; is held by Monmouth Museum and was knitted from coarse 2 ply wool. The cap was made by casting on at the lower edge and knitting in the round towards the top. The crown consists of a classic rounded top, with the last remaining stitches cast off. The yarn tail was wrapped around just below the castoff stitches to gather them, leaving the little lump commonly, but inexactly, referred to as a button. The doubled brim was formed by picking up stitches inside the body of the cap, and worked down to the original cast on. The cast on loops were picked up, and a 3 needle bind-off worked to finish and join the inner brim to the outer cap, ending with a little loop.

Each hat was made weatherproof by felting, a process which reduced its size. The distance from the centre to the hem in this example varies between 5 and 6 inches (150 mm).
Thousands of Monmouth caps were made, but their relatively low cost, and the ease with which the knitting could unravel, means that few remain.

Historically, the wool knit cap was an extremely common form of headgear for seamen, fishers, hunters and others spending their working day outdoors from the 18th century and forward, and is still commonly used for this purpose in the northern regions of North America, Europe, Asia, and other cold regions of the world.

Being found all over the world where climate demands a warm hat, the knit cap can be found under a multitude of local names. In parts of the English-speaking world, this type of knitted hat is traditionally called a beanie. However, in parts of Canada and the US, the word &#x27;beanie&#x27; can additionally be used to denote a different design of brimless cap, which is floppy and made up of joined panels of felt, twill, or other tightly woven cloth rather than being knitted.

A knitted cap with ear flaps is often called a toboggan, or sherpa. The term &quot;&quot; is also sometimes used for knitted caps in Southern American English.

Members of the United States military commonly refer to a knitted cap as a watch cap, as it is the headgear worn while &quot;standing watch&quot; on a ship or guard post. 
In Western Pennsylvania English (Pittsburghese), it is known as a tossle cap. It may also simply be called a &quot;winter hat&quot;.

Other names for knitted caps include woolly hat (British English) or wool hat (American English); bobble hat, sock hat, knit hat, poof ball hat, bonnet, sock cap, stocking cap, skullcap, ski hat, sugan, or chook.

=== Balaclava ===
The pull-down knit cap that goes from the crown over the ears and around the neck, with a hole for the face, was known in the army of the British Empire as an &quot;Uhlan cap&quot; or &quot;Templar cap&quot;. During the Crimean War, handmade pull-down caps were sent to the British troops to help protect them from the bitterly cold weather before or after the Battle of Balaclava. The cap became popularly known a &quot;Balaclava helmet&quot; or just &quot;balaclava&quot; among the soldiers.

=== Scandinavian tophue ===
In Scandinavia, caps resembling a typical knit cap with a pom-pom have been in use since the Viking Age and possibly earlier. The terms &quot;tophue&quot; (Danish), &quot;topplue&quot; (Norwegian), &quot;toppluva&quot; (Swedish) mean &#x27;top cap&#x27;, and refer to the pom-pom.

The Viking-age Rällinge statuette, possibly a depiction of the god Freyr, wears what might be a pointed cap with pom-pom.

Early caps were probably sewn or made with nålebinding, but were knitted from the 17th century onwards, when knitting became known in Scandinavia. Inspired by the phrygian cap of the French Revolution, it became largely ubiquitous during the 18th and 19th century. It is still found in many of the Scandinavian folk costumes for men.

===Canadian toque, tuque or touque ===
In Canadian English, a knit cap is more commonly known as a &quot;toque&quot; (pronounced ; also spelled &quot;tuque&quot; or &quot;&quot;). It is traditionally made of wool and worn in the winter, though in recent years knit &quot;toques&quot; have resurfaced as an extremely popular daily fashion item. They are used all year round, not only outdoors for weather but as an indoor fashion accessory.

&quot;Toque&quot; is also commonly used across New England, especially among the working class. In Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula, it is called a &quot;chook&quot; or &quot;chuke&quot;.

The term is French Canadian. It is widely known in Québecois culture as can be seen through its usage in &quot;La guerre des tuques&quot;.

The Canadian-English term was assimilated from the Canadian-French word &quot;&quot;, and first appeared in this context around 1870. The fashion is said to have originated with the , French and Métis fur traders, who kept their woollen nightcaps on for warmth during cold winter days. This spelling is attributed to a number of different sources, one being from Middle Breton, the language spoken by Breton immigrants at the founding of New France. In Old Breton, it was spelled &quot;toc&quot;; in Modern Breton, it is spelled &quot;tok&quot;, meaning simply &#x27;hat&#x27;.

The French Canadian term likely has its origins with the long hats that were worn by the Voyageurs as they traversed westward on the rivers of North America. The term was picked up by the Blackfeet and entered Chinook Jargon, spreading to the Pacific and the Klondike. Another source suggests that it is a Francization of the Spanish &quot;tocar&quot;, to touch, as the long &quot;end of the sock cap&quot; of the Voyageurs hung down and touched their shoulders; yet another source suggests that the word is borrowed from &quot;the old Languedoc dialect word &quot;tuc&quot;&quot; meaning &quot;summit&quot; or &quot;the head of a mountain&quot;.

The Canadian English spelling of &quot;toque&quot;, on the other hand, is borrowed from the original usage (see Toque). Toques include conical or plumed hats from previous centuries, the tall white hats worn by chefs, and modern snug hats. This spelling (&quot;toque&quot;) also appears in the 1941 &quot;Dictionary of Mississippi Valley French&quot; as a &quot;style of hair-dressing among the Indians&quot;. This was a tall, conical hairstyle not unlike the shape of the Voyageur cap described above.

Dictionaries are divided on the matter of spelling, with the &quot;Gage Canadian&quot; preferring &quot;toque&quot; and the &quot;Nelson Canadian&quot; listing &quot;tuque&quot; (the &quot;Nelson Gage&quot; of a few years later would settle on &quot;toque&quot;). The first &quot;Dictionary of Canadianisms on Historical Principles&quot; lists separate entries and definitions for both &quot;toque&quot; and &quot;tuque&quot; which cross-reference each other. An illustrative line drawing is presented with the latter. Perhaps most importantly, the &quot;Canadian Oxford&quot; chose &quot;toque&quot;, and as the &quot;Canadian Press Stylebook&quot; bows to the &quot;Canadian Oxford&quot; as the final word in spelling, most Canadian publications have followed suit.

Though the requirement of the &quot;toque&quot; to have a pom-pom or no can be a hard line for some Canadians, most of the country agrees: one of these three spellings must be “correct,” no matter what the hat&#x27;s shape may be. As the &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; claims, “We all know a tuque when we see one, [we just] can’t agree on how to spell the word.&quot;

The toque is similar to the Phrygian cap, and, as such, a red tuque during the 1837 Patriotes Rebellion became a symbol of French-Canadian nationalism. The symbol was revived briefly by the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) in the 1960s. Despite this, the toque is also considered a symbol of Canadian identity, due to its ubiquity among English and French Canadians alike. It is also notable for having been the headwear of SCTV&#x27;s Bob and Doug McKenzie.

The word is also occasionally spelled &quot;touque&quot;, though this is not considered a standard spelling by the &quot;Canadian Oxford Dictionary&quot;. In 2013, CBC Edmonton launched a poll to ask viewers how they spelled the word. The options given were &quot;toque&quot;, &quot;tuque&quot; or &quot;touque&quot;. Nearly 6,500 people voted, with Edmontonians remaining divided on the issue. Though &quot;touque&quot; was voted most popular in that instance, there is almost no formal usage to support its popularity. In some sections of Canada, a tuque with a brim on it, commonly worn by snowboarders, is nicknamed a &quot;bruque&quot; (a brimmed tuque).

=== British bobble hat ===
In England, a knit cap may be known as a bobble hat, whether or not it has a yarn &quot;bobble&quot; or pom-pom on top.

Bobble hats were traditionally considered utilitarian cold-weather wear. In the early 21st century they were considered popular only with geeks and nerds. A surprise rise in popularity, driven initially by the Geek-Chic trend, saw them become a fashionable and with a real fur bobble, luxury designer item.

In the late 20th century, in the United Kingdom, they (like the anorak) were associated with utilitarian un-fashionability or with older football supporters, as they had been popular in club colours during the 1960s and 1970s. Along with the pin-on rosette and the football scarf, the bobble hat was seen as traditional or old-fashioned British working-class football regalia.

== In popular culture ==

Knitted caps are common in cold climates, and are worn worldwide in various forms. They have become the common headgear for stereotypical dockworkers and sailors in movies and television. Bill Murray wore this type of hat in &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;, possibly as a parody of the red tuque (or Phrygian cap) worn by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau.

Michael Nesmith of The Monkees also wore a knitted cap in his television series, as did Jay in the films of the View Askewniverse, Robert Clothier&#x27;s character &quot;Relic&quot; in the long-running Canadian TV series &quot;The Beachcombers,&quot; and Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s character Loopy de Loop wore a knit cap as well. Michael Parks wore one as James &quot;Jim&quot; Bronson in the popular series &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot;. Robert Conrad also had worn one in his role of coureur des bois in the epic TV series &quot;Centennial&quot;. Bruce Weitz&#x27;s character Mick Belker wore this hat throughout almost every episode of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.

Everest from the series &quot;PAW Patrol&quot; wears a teal knit cap with white trimmings that she is rarely seen without.

Characters in the animated series &quot;South Park&quot;, including Eric Cartman and Stan Marsh, usually wear knitted caps. Jayne Cobb from the TV series &quot;Firefly&quot; wore an orange sherpa knitted and sent to him by his mother in the episode &quot;The Message&quot;. The character Compo on the British TV show &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; is almost always seen wearing a knitted cap.

Edd from &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; wears a black, loose knit cap almost every time he&#x27;s on screen, which covers something on his head that he&#x27;s embarrassed about.

The guitarist for the Irish band U2, The Edge, is also known for wearing a knitted cap while performing, or during interviews. Tom Delonge, guitarist and vocalist of the pop punk band Blink-182 is also known to wear a knitted cap during live performances. Rob Caggiano, music producer and former guitarist for thrash metal band Anthrax, is often seen wearing a black one. Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band is regularly seen in a black knit cap, even during an Australian summer. Canadian Daniel Powter also wore a blue knitted cap during the music video for &quot;Bad Day&quot;. Knitted caps are also worn commonly by hip hop artists. Masao Inaba from &quot;&quot; wears one.

Santa Claus is often shown with a knitted cap or a sewn cap following the typical Scandinavian-style knitted cap with a pom-pom, a trait he has inherited from the Germanic/Scandinavian tradition. The Scandinavian tomte is likewise usually depicted with a red knitted cap, such a cap is also used as a national symbol (sometimes negatively) in Norway.

Famous instances of tuques (the Canadian knitted cap) in pop culture include:

* the &quot;SCTV&quot; characters Bob and Doug McKenzie, whose signature outfits included a tuque.
* Bonhomme Carnaval, the mascot of the Quebec Winter Carnival wears the traditional red tuque and Ceinture fléchée of the province&#x27;s original French settlers. 
* Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Jonathan Bernier, who wore a toque over his helmet during the 6th annual National Hockey League Winter Classic on January 1, 2014.
* The 1984 Québécois film &quot;La guerre des tuques&quot; (&quot;The War of the Tuques&quot;), which is about an enormous snowball fight.
* Jacques Plante, the Hall of Fame goaltender for the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey team throughout the 1950s, was one of the more notable wearers of the tuque.
* José Théodore, another Canadiens goaltender, wore a tuque on top of his goalie mask during the 2003 Heritage Classic game (which was played at temperatures below ).
* La Tuque, a town in Quebec named after a nearby hill that resembles a tuque.

<text>Kurt Alder (; 10 July 1902 – 20 June 1958) was a German chemist and Nobel laureate.

==Biography==
Alder was born in the industrial area of Königshütte, Silesia (modern day Chorzów, Upper Silesia, Poland), where he received his early schooling. Alder left the area when Königshütte became part of Poland in 1922. He studied chemistry at the University of Berlin from 1922, and later at the University of Kiel where his PhD was awarded in 1926 for work supervised by Otto Paul Hermann Diels.

In 1930 Alder was appointed reader for chemistry at Kiel, and promoted to lecturer in 1934. In 1936 he left Kiel to join I G Farben Industrie at Leverkusen, where he worked on synthetic rubber. Then in 1940 he was appointed Professor of Experimental Chemistry and Chemical Technology at the University of Cologne and Director of the Institute of Chemistry there. Throughout this time and despite the many obstacles to original research in Europe at the time, he continued a systematic program of investigations of his particular interests in the synthesis of organic compounds. In all he published more than 151 papers in this field.

In 1945 he worked closely with the inventor of EDTA, Ferdinand Münz. In 1949 they published a paper together on diene synthesis and additions 

Alder received several honorary degrees and other awards, such as the 1950 Nobel Prize in Chemistry which he shared with his teacher Diels for their work on what is now known as the Diels–Alder reaction. The lunar crater Alder is named in his honour. The insecticide aldrin, created through a Diels–Alder reaction, is also named after the scientist.

Alder died in June 1958, aged 55. The cause of his death is unknown, however his body was found in his apartment in Cologne, Germany after two weeks. His niece, who found the body, stated that the odor of rotting flesh was so bad that she could smell it from the street outside. Gertrud Alder reported that her husband was incredibly distressed when she last saw him and often muttered the phrase &quot;Les Jardins du Souvenir&quot; (The Memory Garden) whilst writing out his research notes.

<doc id="384496" wikidata="Q840065" url="?curid=384496" title="New jack swing">
<text>New jack swing, new jack, or swingbeat is a fusion genre of the rhythms and production techniques of hip hop and dance-pop, and the urban contemporary sound of R&amp;B. Spearheaded by producers Teddy Riley, Bernard Belle, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, new jack swing was most popular from the late 1980s to early 1990s.

Merriam-Webster&#x27;s online dictionary defines new jack swing as &quot;pop music usually performed by black musicians that combines elements of jazz, funk, rap, and rhythm and blues.&quot; New jack swing producers created synthesized tunes and sampled beats, using digital synthesizers (such as the Yamaha DX7 and Roland D50), drum machines (such as the Roland TR-808) and samplers (such as the SP-1200 and Akai samplers), to lay an &quot;insistent beat under light melody lines and clearly enunciated vocals.&quot; The TR-808 in particular was sampled to create distinctive, syncopated, swung rhythms, with its snare sound being especially prominent.

==History==
Kyle West remembered 1985 as the year he listened to new jack swing with Teddy Riley. Riley as well as drummer Lenny White credit the start of new jack swing to English singer-songwriter and producer Junior Giscombe and his 1985 single &quot;Oh Louise&quot;. Some music critics said Full Force&#x27;s &quot;Alice, I Want You Just for Me&quot; (1985) was the first new jack swing song, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis called Full Force and said Alice was their favorite song, and their favorite group was Full Force. After that, Jam &amp; Lewis produced Janet Jackson&#x27;s digital R&amp;B album, &quot;Control&quot; (1986). Musicologist Richard J. Ripani PhD, author of &quot;The New Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm &amp; Blues, 1950–1999&quot; (2006), observed that the album was one of the first successful records to influence the rise of new jack swing by creating a fusion of R&amp;B, rap, funk, disco and synthesized percussion. The new jack swing sound is particularly evident in the second single, &quot;Nasty&quot;. The success of &quot;Control&quot;, according to Ripani, bridged the gap between R&amp;B and rap music. He asserts that &quot;since Jackson&#x27;s album was released in 1986 and was hugely successful, it is not unreasonable to assume that it had at least some impact on the new jack swing creations of Teddy Riley.&quot; Mantronix&#x27;s early records in the mid-1980s also had new jack elements.

The term &quot;new jack swing&quot; was coined in an October 18, 1987 &quot;Village Voice&quot; profile of Teddy Riley by Barry Michael Cooper. &quot;New Jack&quot; was a slang term (meaning ~&#x27;Johnny-come-lately&#x27;) used in a song by Grandmaster Caz of the Cold Crush Brothers, and &quot;swing&quot; was intended by Cooper to draw an &quot;analogy between the music played at the speakeasies of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s time to the crackhouses of Teddy Riley&#x27;s time.&quot;

The term &quot;new jack swing&quot; describes the sound produced and engineered by R&amp;B/hip hop artist and producer Teddy Riley. Riley is an American R&amp;B and hip hop singer-songwriter, musician and record producer. He led the band Guy in the late 1980s and Blackstreet in the 1990s. Riley said, &quot;I define the term [new jack swing] as a new kid on the block who&#x27;s swinging it.&quot; The defining feature of Riley&#x27;s music was the introduction of swingbeats, &quot;a rhythmic pattern using offbeat accented 16th note triplets.&quot; In an interview with Revolt TV in 2017, Andre Harrell called Riley the inventor of the sound, hailing him &quot;the king of New Jack Swing, because he invented it.&quot;

Music website VH1.com notes that, while &quot;hip-hop and R&amp;B are kissing cousins&quot; in the 2000s, &quot;the two genres were seldom mentioned in the same breath&quot; in the early 1980s. However, in the late 1980s, &quot;during the era of high-top fades, and parachute pants, producer Teddy Riley and label boss Andre Harrell successfully fused and marketed the two sounds in a sexy, exclamatory music that critics termed new jack swing. It sparked a revolution.&quot; Riley stated that before new jack swing, &quot;Rappers and singers didn&#x27;t want anything to do with one another&quot;, because &quot;Singers were soft, rappers were street.&quot; Riley&#x27;s new style blended &quot;sweet melody and big beats.&quot; The sensibilities of Riley&#x27;s fusion of the styles would forever change pop music/hip-hop music pairing and was further popularized with Bad Boy&#x27;s dominance of the late &#x27;90s through much of the same techniques. Riley, a 19-year-old man from Harlem, quickly became an A-list producer and commanded big fees to add his sound to major artist projects.

==Influences==
The 1989 film &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; helped spread new jack swing with its theme song, &quot;On Our Own&quot; by Bobby Brown (written by L.A. Reid, Babyface and Daryl Simmons), who was along with Riley nicknamed &quot;The King of New Jack Swing&quot;. NBC sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; also boosted the spread of this culture, as the star of the show, Will Smith, was known initially for his hip-hop duo with DJ Jazzy Jeff. During the first episode of the series, Will Smith dances to the Soul II Soul new jack swing single &quot;Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)&quot;. In other episodes, he sings &quot;Teddy&#x27;s Jam&quot; and &quot;Rump Shaker&quot;. &quot;A Different World&quot;, &quot;Waynehead&quot; and &quot;In Living Color&quot; are other television programs of the era which exhibit influences from the new jack swing style. &quot;Video Soul&quot;, &quot;Soul Train&quot;, &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; as well as the late night talk show &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; also helped to promote these acts.

To date the most successful new jack swing album is &quot;Dangerous&quot;, released in 1991 by Michael Jackson, produced by Jackson and Riley, which has sold over 30 million copies worldwide.

==Golden age==
Many songs with elements of new jack swing peaked in the top 10 of the U.S. R&amp;B and U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. The height of its popularity was 1988-1993, with it reaching its peak in 1990.

In 1987, Keith Sweat&#x27;s first new jack swing song &quot;I Want Her&quot; peaked at number 5 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. It is considered the first official New Jack Swing hit. A few months later, Bobby Brown&#x27;s &quot;My Prerogative&quot; would take the genre even further.

The musician and record producer Teddy Riley&#x27;s group Guy, a group which was one of the early pioneers of hip-hop and R&amp;B had a hit with the song &quot;Groove Me&quot;, which went to number 4 in the US R&amp;B charts, and the 1988 song &quot;Teddy&#x27;s Jam&quot;, which ranked number 5 in the US R&amp;B charts. Single &quot;My Fantasy&quot; was from the OST &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;. &quot;New Jack City&quot; was on the soundtrack for the film of the same title. Johnny Kemp&#x27;s &quot;Just Got Paid&quot; also cracked the top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1988 and went to number 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play. The musician and Al B. Sure! had success with &quot;Nite and Day&quot; and other two singles went to the Top 5 of the R&amp;B chart in 1988.

In 1988, Bobby Brown began his string of Top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; hits from his second album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, which ranked number 1 in the US. In that same year, Paula Abdul had the US number 1 hit &quot;Straight Up&quot;. Tony! Toni! Toné! had three songs in the top ten of the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks, including &quot;Little Walter&quot; which hit number 1. New Edition after being in a transition due to the departure of Bobby Brown recruited Johnny Gill as his placement, leading to the release of the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis produced album &quot;Heart Break&quot;, which spun off five hit singles &quot;If It Isn&#x27;t Love&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Not My Kind of Girl&quot;, &quot;Can You Stand the Rain&quot;, &quot;Crucial&quot;, and &quot;N.E. Heartbreak&quot;.

In 1988, Wreckx-n-Effect, a Teddy Riley-produced group which garnered press attention regarding their use of bikini-clad women in their videos, released &quot;New Jack Swing&quot;, helping to popularize the new name for the emerging style. That same year, Fenderella garnered a hit with &quot;Mr. DJ&quot;, a song with featured Doug E. Fresh, who was known as the &quot;human beatbox&quot; for his realistic imitations of drum machines and other hip-hop sounds.

Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis produced seven hit singles off the 1989 album &quot;Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814&quot;, which merged the Minneapolis sound with new jack swing. The album included a number of successful tracks, such as the number one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits &quot;Miss You Much&quot;. Karyn White, also produced by the Flyte Time team also had hits in the late 1980s and early &#x27;90s. Sheena Easton also had a few hits from her 1991 album &quot;What Comes Naturally&quot; produced by hitmaker Vassel Benford. Producer Babyface had a hit with his song &quot;It&#x27;s No Crime&quot;, which ranked number 7 in the US charts and number 1 on the US R&amp;B charts. Another Teddy Riley–produced group, Today, had a hit with &quot;Girl I Got My Eyes on You&quot;, which garnered a number 1 spot on the US R&amp;B charts.

After the band New Edition broke up, its former members formed several splinter groups or acts, including Bell Biv DeVoe, Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant, and Bobby Brown. In 1990, several ex-New Edition members had hit songs. Bell Biv DeVoe&#x27;s songs &quot;Poison&quot; and &quot;Do Me!&quot;, as well as Johnny Gill&#x27;s single &quot;Rub You the Right Way&quot;, all made it to number 3 in the US top 100. Ralph Tresvant had a number 4 hit (US top 100 charts) and number 1 hit (US R&amp;B) with his song &quot;Sensitivity&quot;, with another on the &quot;House Party 2&quot; soundtrack &quot;Yo Baby Yo&quot;. Also in 1990 pop singer Whitney Houston recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot;, produced by Babyface &amp; Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid (later a record executive). The single topped the US Hot 100, giving Babyface his first produced number 1 song while further helping to bring the genre to the mainstream. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;My Name Is Not Susan&quot;, also utilized the same style, peaking at number 20 on the US Top 100.

In 1990, &quot;Hold On&quot;, produced by Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy and co-written with members of En Vogue (the new Oakland, California girl group they co-founded), was released as the first single off the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Born to Sing&quot; (1990). The song peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 1 on the Billboard Dance Club Play, 12-inch Singles Sales, and Hot Black Singles charts. &quot;Hold On&quot; was one of several tracks on their debut album and sophomore album &quot;Funky Divas&quot; (1992) to feature new jack swing. Both albums were certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Meanwhile, Samuelle, a former member of the disco-infused dance-urban group Club Nouveau had a number 1 R&amp;B hit with &quot;So You Like What You See&quot;. Troop also had a number 1 hit with a single from their second album, &quot;Attitude&quot;, entitled &quot;Spread My Wings&quot;. &quot;Feels Good&quot; by the Oakland group Tony! Toni! Toné! reached number 1 on the R&amp;B charts in 1990, and it also placed on the US top 100 (number 9) and on the dance charts (number 3).

&quot;Feels Like Another One&quot; is a 1991 single co-written and recorded by singer Patti LaBelle off her album, &quot;Burnin&quot;. The new jack swing-styled track was the leading track for LaBelle&#x27;s eleventh solo album and featured a rap from rapper Big Daddy Kane. The track became successful on the R&amp;B chart as it ended up peaking at number three on the Hot R&amp;B Singles chart. The video for the song was shot at the Apollo Theater and also featured Kane, who appeared at LaBelle&#x27;s show wearing a tux. The song would help LaBelle&#x27;s album go gold. Color Me Badd had a number 1 hit with &quot;I Wanna Sex You Up&quot;. That same year, Christopher Williams released a single &quot;I&#x27;m Dreamin&#x27;&quot; from the&quot; New Jack City&quot; soundtrack, which became a number 1 single on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. Boyz II Men&#x27;s debut single &quot;Motownphilly&quot; was a number 1 R&amp;B and top 5 U.S. pop hit. &quot;I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)&quot; by Hi-Five garnered the US number 1 and R&amp;B number 1 spots. Jodeci&#x27;s debut album &quot;Forever My Lady&quot; garnered three number 1 R&amp;B Hits in the fall of 1991 (&quot;Forever My Lady&quot;, &quot;Stay&quot;, and &quot;Come and Talk To Me&quot;).
&quot;Exclusivity&quot; by Damian Dame charted as number-one R&amp;B single, spending two weeks at the top position, a position also achieved by the Rude Boys with their song &quot;Are You Lonely For Me&quot;.

In 1992, Michael Jackson&#x27;s singles &quot;Remember the Time&quot; and &quot;In the Closet&quot; placed in the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, the top 2 in the Hot Dance Music/Club category, and reached number 1 in the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop category. &quot;Jam&quot; also reached the top 5 in Hot Dance Music/Club and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop. Joe Public&#x27;s single &quot;Live and Learn&quot; hit number 4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, number 3 on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart and becoming the group&#x27;s most successful single. In 1993 Teddy Riley&#x27;s new group Blackstreet got new jack swing hit &quot;Baby Be Mine&quot;. Chuckii Booker scored a number 1 R&amp;B hit with his song &quot;Games&quot;. That same year, &quot;She&#x27;s Got That Vibe&quot; by R. Kelly and Public Announcement reached the number 7 position on the R&amp;B charts. &quot;Weak&quot; by SWV (Sisters With Voices) hit the number one spot on both the US top 100 and the R&amp;B charts. In 1993: &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away&quot; by Jade made it to number 4 and number 3 in the US top 100 and R&amp;B charts, respectively.

On the TLC Tip&quot; (1992) had several hits, including &quot;What About Your Friends&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t 2 Proud 2 Beg&quot; and &quot;Baby-Baby-Baby&quot;.

In 1995, Montell Jordan had a number one new jack swing hit, in &quot;This is How We Do It&quot;, which after its release saw the popularity of the genre decline. As hip hop culture became increasingly ubiquitous, the pop-crossover approach and perceived artifice of new jack swing began to lose its appeal with young urban listeners. Even the creator of the New Jack Swing, Teddy Riley, made his sound evolve with his second supergroup BLACKStreet, with their 1994&#x27;s eponymous first album. A sound he sometimes called &quot;Heavy R&amp;B&quot; in interviews.

The last hit single to use the classic new jack swing sound was Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor&quot;, released in 1997.

==Incorporation into pop music==
Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue incorporated a strong new jack swing sound into her 1991 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot;, most notably the lead single &quot;Word Is Out&quot;. The album and singles achieved notable success in the UK, Australia and throughout Europe.

American pop singer Bruno Mars infused elements into his 2016 third album &quot;24K Magic&quot;, with fifth single &quot;Finesse&quot; being completely influenced by new jack swing. The song was a commercial success, peaking at number two in New Zealand, number three in the United States and Canada, and the top ten of Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

<text>Dutch courage, also known as pot-valiance or liquid courage, refers to courage gained from intoxication with alcohol.

==Uses==

=== Criminal ===

Alcohol is occasionally used by criminals as a tool to commit alcohol-related offenses. These may include alcohol-facilitated sexual assaults, drunk driving, thefts (for example motor vehicle thefts), or alcohol-fueled robberies and violent crimes. However, Dutch courage defense is not a valid intoxication defense.

Consuming alcohol prior to visiting female sex workers is a common practice among some men. Also, sex workers often resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope with stress. However, female sex workers in low- and middle-income countries have high rates of harmful alcohol use, which is associated with increased risk of unprotected sex and sexually transmitted infections.

=== Hookup culture ===
Alcohol use among college students is often used as &quot;liquid courage&quot; in the hookup culture, for them to make a sexual advance in the first place. However, a recent trend called &quot;dry dating&quot; is gaining popularity to replace &quot;liquid courage&quot;, which involves going on dates without consuming alcohol.

=== Warfare ===

Alcohol has a long association of military use, and has been called &quot;liquid courage&quot; for its role in preparing troops for battle. It has also been used to anaesthetize injured soldiers, celebrate military victories, and cope with the emotions of defeat.

Military and veteran populations face significant challenges in addressing the co-occurrence of PTSD and alcohol use disorder. While existing interventions show promise, more research is needed to evaluate their effectiveness for this specific population, and new tailored interventions should be developed and evaluated to better meet their unique needs.

== History ==
The popular story dates the etymology of the term Dutch courage to English soldiers fighting in the Anglo-Dutch Wars (1652–1674) and perhaps as early as the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). One version states that jenever (or Dutch gin) was used by English soldiers for its calming effects before battle, and for its purported warming properties on the body in cold weather. Another version has it that English soldiers noted the bravery-inducing effects of jenever on Dutch soldiers.

Gin is a Dutch invention, and was first distilled in Holland in the 16th century. The flavouring in gin comes from juniper berries. The Dutch word for &#x27;juniper&#x27; is &#x27;jenever&#x27;, which got Anglicised to &#x27;ginever&#x27; and then finally to &#x27;gin&#x27;. Gin would go on to become popular in England thanks to King William III of England (William of Orange, ), who was also Stadtholder of the Netherlands.

There is a strong association of military service and alcohol use disorder. In 1862, British soldiers in India responded to the threat of problematic alcohol use by establishing the Soldiers&#x27; Total Abstinence Association, which became the Army Temperance Association in 1888. Similar organizations formed in other branches of military and for British troops stationed in other colonies. Members of these abstinence associations were encouraged to sign pledges to avoid alcohol entirely. Medals were awarded to individuals who remained abstinent. Studies show that Australian Defence Force veterans of the Gulf War had a prevalence of alcohol use disorder higher than any other psychological disorder; British Armed Forces veterans of modern conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan had higher rates of alcohol use disorder than servicemembers who were not deployed.

Alcohol has a long association of military use, and has been called &quot;liquid courage&quot; for its role in preparing troops for battle. It has also been used to anaesthetize injured soldiers, celebrate military victories, and cope with the emotions of defeat. In the Russo-Japanese War, alcohol has been implicated as a factor contributing to the Russian Empire&#x27;s loss. Russian commanders, sailors, and soldiers were said to be drunk more than sober. Countries often enabled alcohol use by their troops through providing alcohol in their rations. The British Royal Navy and other Commonwealth navies once maintained a rum ration for sailors until Britain retired it in 1970. The Royal Canadian Navy followed suit in 1972 as did the Royal New Zealand Navy in 1990. The United States Navy similarly provided a distilled spirits ration between 1794 and 1862 when Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles removed most non-medicinal alcohol from U.S. naval vessels, with all alcohol consumption aboard ship banned in 1914.

At the start of World War II, alcohol consumption was widespread among members of the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany. At first, high-ranking officials encouraged its use as a means of relaxation and a crude method of mitigating the psychological effects of combat, in the latter case through what later scientific developments would describe as blocking the consolidation of traumatic memories. After the Fall of France, however, Wehrmacht commanders observed that their soldiers&#x27; behavior was deteriorating, with &quot;fights, accidents, mistreatment of subordinates, violence against superior officers and &quot;crimes involving unnatural sexual acts&quot; becoming more frequent. The Commander-in-Chief of the German military, General Walther von Brauchitsch, concluded that his troops were committing &quot;most serious infractions&quot; of morality and discipline, and that the culprit was alcohol abuse. In response, Hitler attempted to curb the reckless use of alcohol in the military, promising severe punishment for soldiers who exhibited public drunkenness or otherwise &quot;allow[ed] themselves to be tempted to engage in criminal acts as a result of alcohol abuse.&quot; Serious offenders could expect &quot;a humiliating death.&quot; This revised policy accompanied an increase in Nazi Party disapproval of alcohol use in the civilian sector, reflecting an extension to alcohol of the longstanding Nazi condemnation of tobacco consumption as diminishing the strength and purity of the &quot;Aryan race.&quot;

<text>The Tututni tribe is a historic Native American tribe, one of Lower Rogue River Athabascan tribes from southwestern Oregon who signed the 1855 Coast Treaty, and were removed to the Siletz Indian Reservation in Oregon. They traditionally lived along the Rogue River and its tributaries, near the Pacific Coast between the Coquille River on the north and Chetco River in the south. 
Lower Rogue River Athabascan (also called Tututni) tribes are a group of Athabascan tribes (the Tututni, Upper Coquille and Shasta Costa) who were historically located in southwestern Oregon in the United States and speak the same Athabascan language, known as Lower Rogue River (or Tututni, or Tututni-Shasta Costa-Coquille).

==Rogue River Athabascans vs. Rogue River Indians==
In its narrower sense, the term &quot;Rogue River&quot; refers to the Rogue River Athabascan tribes who speak two closely related languages: Lower Rogue River (also known as Tututni) and Upper Rogue River (also known as Galice-Applegate).

In its broader sense, &quot;Rogue River&quot; as a term refers to Rogue River Indians, a conglomeration of many tribal groups in the total Rogue River Valley area. They belong to three language families: Athabaskan, Takelma, and Shastan.

==Lower Rogue River Athabascan groups==
The Tututni (or Lower Rogue River Athabascan) tribes included the following:
*Upper Coquille (Coquille, Mishikwutinetunne) tribe, 
*Shasta Costa tribe, and 
*Tututni tribe, including Euchre Creek (Yukichetunne) band. 
::Bands of Tututni tribe include 
**the &quot;Kwatami&quot;, 
**&quot;Tututunne&quot;, 
**&quot;Mikonotunne&quot;, 
**&quot;Chemetunne&quot;, 
**&quot;Chetleshin&quot;, 
**&quot;Kwaishtunnetunne&quot;,

===Tututni tribe===
&quot;There were as many as seven Tututni groups, who were culturally related and had kinship ties. They did not, however, constitute a typical tribe because the usual sociopolitical organization, involving chiefs and governmental authority, was lacking&quot;.

I) Tututni dialect speaking:







II) Euchre Creek (Yukiche-tunne) dialect speaking:

===Upper Coquille tribe===
III) Upper Coquille (Coquille, Mishi-kwutine-tunne) dialect speaking:


===Shasta Costa tribe===
IV) Chasta Costa (Shasta Costa, Chasta Kosta, Shistakoostee, Illinois River) dialect speaking:

==Language==
The Tututni (Lower Rogue River Athabascan) tribes spoke dialects of the Lower Rogue River (or Tututni or Tututni-Shasta Costa-Coquille) language. In the 21st century, this Pacific Coast Athabaskan language is extinct; it was classified as part of the Oregon Athabascan subgroup. Dialects were Coquille (Upper Coquille, Mishikhwutmetunee), spoken along the upper Coquille River; Tututni (Tututunne, Naltunnetunne, Mikonotunne, Kwatami, Chemetunne, Chetleshin, Khwaishtunnetunnne); Euchre Creek, and Chasta Costa (Illinois River, &quot;Šista Qʼʷə́sta&quot;).

==History==
The first contact between Tututni tribe and Europeans came in the late 1700s when British, Spanish and American ships explored Oregon&#x27;s coastal region. In the spring of 1792, some Tututni met British explorer Captain George Vancouver. Merchants traded with the Tututni for sea otter pelts. With the arrival of settlers, infectious diseases new to the Native Americans were transmitted, resulting in the deaths of 75% to 90% of the populations of many Oregon native peoples. They did not have any acquired immunity to these diseases, such as smallpox, measles, and others that were endemic among Europeans and Americans.

In the 1840s the first wagon trains carrying immigrants started arriving overland to Oregon (Emigrant Road or Oregon Trail), but the region remained peaceful for some time.

During the 1850s the Tututni game trails and hunting grounds were destroyed by whites clearing land for farms. In 1851 some settlers built Port Orford on Tututni land. The Tututni came under more pressure as settlers and miners were attracted to Port Orford after the discovery of gold in the Rogue River valley. Mining activities heightened the competition for resources and tensions between the Tututni and the European Americans. Armed conflicts finally led to the Rogue River Wars of 1855–1856, in which United States troops, volunteer militia and others fought against the Native Americans. In February 1856 Tututni attacked the Gold Beach Guards, who were encamped opposite the large Tututni village at Port Orford. In the conflict the Tututni burned most of the settlers&#x27; homes between Port Orford and Smith River.

After the Rogue River Wars in 1856, the Tututni and other Rogue River Indians were removed from this area, forced to settle on the Coast Indian Reservation (the base of the Confederated Tribes of Siletz), considerably north of their traditional territory, or the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation, base of what is known as the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon.

The several tribes at each of these reservations have intermarried and their descendants are counted as enrolled members of the consolidated tribes.

The Tututni Tribe is not a federally acknowledged tribe, but the Confederated Tribes of Siletz is a recognized tribe.

<text>The Force M.D.s are an American R&amp;B vocal group that was formed in 1981 in Staten Island, New York. Although the group has old school hip hop roots, it is perhaps best known for their soulful R&amp;B tunes such as &quot;Tender Love,&quot; &quot;Love Is a House,&quot; &quot;Tears,&quot; and &quot;Here I Go Again.&quot; They are considered major forerunners of the new jack swing movement.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The band was originally named The L.D.s, and then became the Force MCs. Though the group was not quite always as recognizable as other New York R&amp;B acts when it first started, they were among the first R&amp;B vocal groups to intermix doo-wop-affected singing with and sometimes over hip-hop beats.

The group was composed of brothers Stevie D., Antoine &quot;T.C.D.&quot; (February 3, 1963 – January 18, 1998), and Rodney &quot;Khalil&quot; Lundy, and their uncle Jessie Lee Daniels (July 4, 1963 – January 4, 2022). Later, friends Trisco Pearson (October 23, 1962 – September 16, 2016) and Charles &quot;Mercury&quot; Nelson (December 19, 1964 – March 9, 1995) from the Mariners Harbor housing projects joined the group.

===Performing and signing with a record label===
The group began performing on Times Square, New York City street corners and during trips on the Staten Island ferry. After the L.D.s connected with DJ Dr. Rock (Roger Daniels) they then performed as &quot;Dr. Rock &amp; the Force MCs.&quot; The group was discovered by hip hop promoter Vansilk in summer 1981. The three members were Dr. Rock, Stevie D. and Mercury. In collaboration with Dr. Rock, the group continued to perfect their unique sound, which was unusual at the time: a fusion of doo-wop harmonies and hip-hop that involved singing, rapping and group member&#x27;s &quot;human beatbox&quot; melodies at underground hip hop shows. They gained even more credibility and respect from local fans after competing in an emcee lyrical battle against the well known Cold Crush Brothers from the Bronx in 1983.

By 1984, the group signed with Tommy Boy Records. This is the same year the group changed their name to the Force MDs, which stood for “Musical Diversity”. They had developed into a quiet storm/contemporary R&amp;B group, with its top-ten R&amp;B hit, &quot;Tears&quot;, from the debut album, &quot;Love Letters&quot;. (With the exception of their first album, the group was the first act on Tommy Boy to have major-label distribution through its then-parent Warner Bros. Records.)

=== Success ===
The group produced a collection of R&amp;B hits throughout the 1980s, and received overwhelming commercial success from the Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis-penned love song &quot;Tender Love&quot; from their second album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Chillin&#x27;&quot;. The song was featured in the 1985 feature film and soundtrack &quot;Krush Groove&quot;, and proved to be a success, peaking at No. 10 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, becoming an instant R&amp;B classic after it stayed on the chart for 19 weeks. &quot;Tender Love&quot; was also one of the tracks that helped Jam &amp; Lewis garner a Grammy Award for Producer of the Year. The song &quot;Itchin&#x27; for a Scratch&quot; was performed by the group in the 1985 feature film &quot;Rappin&#x27;&quot;, and was also part of the soundtrack.

In 1987 they finally scored their first R&amp;B #1 hit, &quot;Love Is a House,&quot; from their third album, &quot;Touch and Go&quot;.

=== Waning popularity and member changes ===
By the late 1980s the group&#x27;s popularity began to wane. A fourth album, &quot;Step to Me&quot;, was released in 1990, which featured record production by Full Force, Marley Marl, Monte Moir (of the band The Time), and others. Members Pearson and Nelson left soon afterward, replaced by original member Rodney &quot;Khalil&quot; Lundy (who had initially left the band early in their career) and new member Shawn Waters. The group then released the album &quot;Moments in Time&quot; in 1994, but failed to chart or produce any hits. In 1996 the group appeared on several tracks on the Ghostface Killah album &quot;Ironman&quot;.

===Deaths in the group and a last reunion===
Three of the group&#x27;s members died during the latter half of the 1990s: Nelson suffered a fatal heart attack in 1995; former collaborator DJ Dr. Rock died suddenly of AIDS in 1996; and in 1998, Antoine Lundy died of Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease.

Surviving members of the group&#x27;s classic lineup - Daniels, Pearson, and Stevie D. Lundy - along with Rodney Lundy returned with a comeback album, &quot;The Reunion&quot;, in 2000, but it failed to chart or register any hits. Damen Heyward, a native of The Bronx formerly of the mid-/late-1980s group 4 By Four, later joined the group as well. After leaving the group, Heyward went on to tour with artists such as Joe.

Trisco Pearson died on September 16, 2016, at age 53, after a battle with stage 4 cancer. His death was announced by Bow Legged Lou of Full Force. Jessie Daniels died on January 4, 2022, at the age of 58.

== Legacy ==

* On September 9, 2015, they were featured on an episode of TV One&#x27;s &quot;Unsung&quot;.
* The members of Force MD&#x27;s were referenced in the song &quot;Okkervil River R.I.P.&quot; by indie-folk band Okkervil River on their 2016 album Away.

<doc id="384512" wikidata="Q318380" url="?curid=384512" title="Francis, Duke of Anjou">
<text>&quot;Monsieur&quot; François, Duke of Anjou and Alençon (; 18 March 1555 – 10 June 1584) was the youngest son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

==Early years==

He was scarred by smallpox at age eight, and his pitted face and slightly deformed spine did not suit his birth name of &quot;Hercule&quot;. He changed his name to Francis in honour of his late brother Francis II of France when he was confirmed.

The royal children were raised under the supervision of the governor and governess of the royal children, Claude d&#x27;Urfé and Françoise d&#x27;Humières, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers.

In 1574, following the death of his brother Charles IX of France and the accession of his other brother Henry III of France, he became heir to the throne. In 1576 he was made Duke of Anjou, Touraine, and Berry.
== Alençon and the Huguenots==

During the night of 13 September 1575, Alençon fled from the French court after being alienated from his brother King Henry III as they had had some differences. Both Henry III and Catherine de&#x27; Medici feared he would join the Protestant rebels. These fears proved well-founded; Francis joined the prince of Condé and his forces in the south. In February 1576, Henry, King of Navarre escaped from the French court, whereupon his forces also joined Condé. This combined army was enough to force Henry III, without a pitched battle of any sort, to capitulate and sign the very pro-Protestant &quot;peace of Monsieur&quot;, or Edict of Beaulieu, on 6 May 1576. By &quot;secret treaties&quot; which formed part of this peace settlement, many on the Protestant side were rewarded with land and titles. Francis was awarded the Duchy of Anjou (along with other lands) and thus became the Duke of Anjou. He had the writer Jean de La Gessée as a secretary.

==Courting Elizabeth I==
In 1579, negotiations commenced for marrying Anjou to Elizabeth I of England. The Duke of Anjou was in fact the only one of Elizabeth&#x27;s foreign suitors to court her in person. He made two visits to England, in 1579 and 1581. He was 24 and Elizabeth was 46. Despite the age gap, the two soon became very close, Elizabeth dubbing him her &quot;frog.&quot; While a few believe this nickname arose from a frog-shaped earring he had given her, &quot;frog&quot; has been an unflattering slang nickname for the French for centuries. Whether or not Elizabeth truly planned to marry Anjou is a hotly debated topic. She was quite fond of him, knowing that he was probably going to be her last suitor. The match was controversial among the English public: English Protestants warned the Queen that the &quot;hearts [of the English people] will be galled when they shall see you take to husband a Frenchman, and a Papist ... the very common people well know this: that he is the son of the Jezebel of our age,&quot; referring to the Duke&#x27;s mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici. Among members of Elizabeth&#x27;s Privy Council, only William Cecil, Lord Burghley, and Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex, supported the marriage scheme wholeheartedly. Most notable councillors, foremost among them Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and Sir Francis Walsingham, strongly opposed it, even warning the Queen of the hazards of childbirth at her age.

Between 1578 and 1581, the Queen resurrected attempts to negotiate a marriage with the Duke of Alençon. The Duke put himself forward as a protector of the Huguenots and a potential leader of the Dutch. In these years, Walsingham became friends with the diplomat of Henry of Navarre in England, the anti-monarchist Philippe de Mornay. Walsingham was sent to France in mid-1581 to discuss an Anglo-French alliance, but the French wanted the marriage agreed first, and Walsingham had instructions to obtain a treaty before committing to the marriage. He returned to England without an agreement. Personally, Walsingham opposed the marriage, perhaps to the point of encouraging public opposition. Alençon was a Catholic, and as his elder brother, Henry III, was childless, he was heir presumptive to the French throne. Elizabeth was probably past the age of childbearing, and had no clear successor. If she died while married to the French heir, her realms could fall under French control. By comparing the match of Elizabeth and Alençon with the match of the Protestant Henry of Navarre and the Catholic Margaret of Valois, which occurred in the week before the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre, the &quot;most horrible spectacle&quot; he had ever witnessed, Walsingham raised the spectre of religious riots in England in the event of the marriage proceeding. According to the Earl of Leicester, Elizabeth tolerated his blunt opinions and often unwelcome advice, referring to Walsingham as &quot;her Moor who cannot change his colour&quot; with regard to his strong beliefs.

Eventually, Elizabeth pragmatically judged the union an unwise one, after considering the overwhelming opposition of her advisors. She continued, however, to play the engagement game, if only to warn Philip II of Spain, another of her suitors, what she might do, if it became necessary. Finally, Elizabeth bade him farewell in 1581. On his departure she penned a poem, &quot;On Monsieur&#x27;s Departure&quot;, which, taken at face value, has lent credence to the notion that she may really have been prepared to go through with the match.

==Anjou in the Netherlands==
Anjou continued on to the Netherlands. In 1579 William the Silent had invited him to become hereditary sovereign of the United Provinces, and on 29 September 1580 the Dutch States General (with the exception of Zeeland and Holland) had signed the Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours with the Duke, who would assume the title &quot;Protector of the Liberty of the Netherlands&quot; and become the sovereign. He did not arrive until 10 February 1582, when William officially welcomed him in Flushing. In spite of the Joyous Entries he was accorded in Bruges and Ghent and his ceremonious installation as Duke of Brabant and Count of Flanders, Anjou was not popular with the Dutch and Flemish, who continued to see the Catholic French as enemies; the provinces of Zeeland and Holland refused to recognise him as their sovereign, and William, the central figure of the &quot;Politiques&quot; who worked to defuse religious hostilities, came under extensive criticism for his &quot;French politics&quot;. 

He is now thought to have been the patron behind the &quot;Valois tapestries&quot; presented to Catherine de&#x27; Medici, which depicted major figures in Catherine&#x27;s court against scenes of festivity. When Anjou&#x27;s French troops arrived in late 1582, William&#x27;s plan seemed to pay off, as even the Duke of Parma feared that the Dutch would now gain the upper hand.

However, Anjou himself, dissatisfied with his limited power, decided to take control of the Flemish cities of Antwerp, Bruges, Dunkirk, and Ostend by force.

He would personally lead the attack on Antwerp. To fool the citizens of Antwerp, Anjou proposed that he should make a &quot;Joyous Entry&quot; into the city, a grand ceremony in which he would be accompanied by his French troops. On 18 January 1583, Anjou entered Antwerp, but the citizens had not been deceived. The city militia ambushed and destroyed Anjou&#x27;s force in the French Fury. Anjou barely escaped with his life.

==Death==

The debacle at Antwerp marked the end of Anjou&#x27;s military career. His mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, is said to have written to him that &quot;would to God you had died young. You would then not have been the cause of the death of so many brave gentlemen.&quot; Another insult followed when Elizabeth I formally ended her engagement to him after the massacre. The position of Anjou after this attack became impossible to hold, and he eventually left the country in June. His departure also discredited William, who nevertheless maintained his support for Anjou.

Soon Anjou fell seriously ill with &quot;tertian ague&quot;, malaria. Catherine de&#x27; Medici brought him back to Paris, where he reconciled with his brother, King Henry III of France, in February 1584. Henry even embraced his brother, whom he had famously called &quot;le petit magot&quot; (&quot;little macaque&quot;). By June, the Duke of Anjou was dead. He was 29. His premature death meant that the Huguenot Henry of Navarre became heir-presumptive, thus leading to an escalation in the French Wars of Religion.

<text>A Dutch door (American English), stable door (British English), or half door (Hiberno-English) is a door divided in such a fashion that the bottom half may remain shut while the top half opens. They were known in early New England as double-hung doors. The initial purpose of this door design was to keep animals out of farmhouses or to keep children inside while allowing light and air to filter through the open top, essentially combining a door with a fairly large window. When the top half was open, they also allowed a breeze, but stopped the wind from blowing dirt into the house.

== Uses ==
This type of door was common in the Netherlands in the 17th century and appears in Dutch paintings of the period. They were also commonly found in the culturally-Dutch areas of New York and New Jersey before the American Revolution.

Dutch doors were often incorporated into the design of passenger railcars in North America to allow crewmen to interact with employees outside or to carry out visual inspections. In Australia, post-war passenger cars and brakevans were similarly configured. However, those on passenger cars were later converted to conventional doors for passenger safety reasons. In Canada, changes to operating rules rendered the Dutch doors obsolete, although older rolling stock retains them.

Similar doors were once commonplace in Irish houses, called half-doors ( or &quot;comhla bheag&quot;). According to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, &quot;A traditional half-door is really a door and a half – a full door that opens inwards and a half door set to the front of the frame that opens outwards.&quot; They were designed to keep poultry and pigs from entering the house, as well as allowing air and sunlight into the usually dark and smoky cottages.

They have been used internally in residential care homes to control wandering but maintain a line of sight and in child-care environments, but in that context, there are risks of finger-trapping and concerns over fire regulations.

== See also ==
A Lev door is another type of split leaf door, in floor-to-ceiling configuration, with a standard size leaf and a disconnected additional leaf installed in the space above it, which enables the unrestricted passage of heated air along the ceiling from central source, improves cross ventilation, and maintains privacy.

<doc id="384515" wikidata="Q2354545" url="?curid=384515" title="Philip Kearny">
<text>Philip Kearny Jr. (; June 1, 1815 – September 1, 1862) was a United States Army officer, notable for his leadership in the Mexican–American War and American Civil War. He served in French Emperor Napoleon III&#x27;s Imperial Guard at the Battle of Solferino.

The first U.S. citizen to be awarded the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot;, he was killed in action in the 1862 Battle of Chantilly.

==Early life and career==

Kearny was born in New York City to a wealthy Irish American family. His father and mother were Philip Kearny Sr., and Susan Watts. His maternal grandfather John Watts, the last Royal Recorder of New York City, was one of New York&#x27;s wealthiest residents, who had vast holdings in ships, mills, factories, banks, and investment houses. Kearny&#x27;s father was a Harvard-educated, New York City financier who owned his own brokerage firm and was also a founder of the New York Stock Exchange.

Early in life, Kearny desired a career in the military. His parents died when he was young, and he was consequently raised by his grandfather. Against the younger Kearny&#x27;s wishes, his guardian insisted that Kearny pursue a law career. Kearny attended Columbia College, attaining a law degree in 1833. His cousin John Watts de Peyster, who had also attended Columbia, wrote the first authoritative biography on Kearny.

In 1836, his grandfather died, leaving Kearny a fortune of over $1 million ($ in dollars). He chose to make the army his profession. The following year, Kearny obtained a commission as a second lieutenant of cavalry, assigned to the 1st U.S. Dragoons, who were commanded by his uncle, Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, and whose adjutant general was Jefferson Davis. The regiment was assigned to the western frontier.

Kearny was sent to France in 1839 to study cavalry tactics, first attending school at the famous cavalry school in Saumur. He participated in several combat engagements with the &quot;Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique&quot; in Algeria. Kearny rode into battle with a sword in his right hand, pistol in his left, and the reins in his teeth, as was the style of the Chasseurs. His fearless character in battle earned him the nickname from his French comrades of &quot;Kearny le Magnifique&quot; (&quot;Kearny the Magnificent&quot;). He returned to the United States in the fall of 1840 and prepared a cavalry manual for the Army based on his experiences overseas.

Shortly afterward, Kearny was designated aide-de-camp to General Alexander Macomb, and served in this position until Macomb&#x27;s death in June 1841. After a few months at the cavalry barracks in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Kearny was assigned to the staff of General Winfield Scott, soon becoming his aide-de-camp. He did additional duty on the frontier, accompanying his uncle&#x27;s unit on an expedition to the South Pass of the Oregon Trail in 1845.

===Mexican War===
Kearny, disappointed with the lack of fighting he was seeing in the Army, resigned his commission in 1846, but returned to duty a month later at the outbreak of the Mexican–American War. Kearny was assigned to raise a troop of cavalry for the 1st U.S. Dragoons, Company F, in Terre Haute, Indiana. He spared no expense in recruiting his men and acquired 120 matched dapple gray horses with his own money. The unit was originally stationed at the Rio Grande but soon became the personal bodyguard for General Scott, the commander-in-chief of the Army in Mexico. Kearny was promoted to captain in December 1846.

Kearny and his men participated in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco; in the latter engagement, Kearny led a daring cavalry charge and suffered a grapeshot wound to his left arm. It later had to be amputated. Kearny&#x27;s courage earned him the respect of his soldiers and fellow officers alike; General-in-Chief Winfield Scott called him &quot;a perfect soldier&quot; and &quot;the bravest man I ever knew.&quot; Kearny quickly returned to duty. When the U.S. Army entered Mexico City the following month, he had the personal distinction of being the first man through the gates of the city.

Kearny was an original member of the Aztec Club of 1847, a military society for Army officers who served in Mexico in 1847. Its membership qualifications were later modified to include all American officers who served during the Mexican War and their male descendants.

===Resignation and service in France===
After the war, Kearny did a stint with the Army recruiting service in New York City. While there, he was presented with a sword by the Union Club for his service during the war, and was brevetted to major.

In 1851, he was a member of a unit that saw action against the Rogue River Indians in Oregon. After the failure of his marriage, frustrated with the slow promotion process of the Army, Kearny resigned his commission in October of that year. He embarked on a trip around the world, visiting China, Ceylon, and France. In Paris, Kearny fell in love with a New York City woman named Agnes Maxwell, but was unable to marry her because his first wife would not grant him a divorce. In 1854, Kearny was injured when the horse he was riding fell through a rotten bridge. Maxwell moved in to take care of him.

By 1855, Agnes and Kearny had left New York to escape the disapproval of society. They settled in Kearny&#x27;s new mansion, Bellegrove, overlooking the Passaic River (in what is now Kearny, New Jersey). It was a short distance and across the river from his family&#x27;s old manor in Newark, New Jersey. In 1858 his wife finally granted a divorce. Kearny and Maxwell moved to Paris, where they were married.

In 1859, Kearny returned to France, re-joining the &quot;Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique&quot;, who were at the time fighting against Austrian forces in Italy. Later, he was with Napoleon III&#x27;s Imperial Guard at the Battle of Solferino, where he charged with the cavalry under &quot;Général&quot; Louis-Michel Morris, which penetrated the Austrian center and captured the key point of the battle. For this action, Kearny was awarded the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;, becoming the first U.S. citizen to be thus honored.

==Civil War==
When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Kearny returned to the United States and was appointed a brigadier general, commanding the First New Jersey Brigade, which he trained. The Army had been reluctant to restore his commission due to his disability, but the shocking Union defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run made them realize the importance of seasoned combat officers. His brigade, even after he left to command a division, performed spectacularly, especially at the Battle of Glendale.

He received command of the 3rd Division of the III Corps on April 30, 1862. He led the division into action at the Battle of Williamsburg and the Battle of Fair Oaks. At Williamsburg, as he led his troops onto the field, Kearny shouted (in a notable quote), &quot;I&#x27;m a one-armed Jersey son-of-a-gun, follow me!&quot; The general led the charge with his sword in hand, reins in his teeth. He is noted for urging his troops forward by declaring, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, men, they&#x27;ll all be firing at me!&quot; His performance during the Peninsula Campaign earned him much respect from the army and his superiors. He disliked the commander of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, whose orders (especially those to fall back) he frequently ignored. After the Battle of Malvern Hill, which was a Union victory, McClellan ordered a withdrawal, and Kearny wrote:

Kearny is credited with devising the first unit insignia patches used in the U.S. Army. In the summer of 1862, he issued an order that his officers should wear a patch of red cloth on the front of their caps to identify themselves as members of his unit. The enlisted men, with whom Kearny was quite popular, quickly followed suit voluntarily. Members of other units picked up on the idea, devising their own insignia, and these evolved over the years into the modern shoulder patch. (Daniel Butterfield is credited with taking Kearny&#x27;s idea and standardizing it for all corps in the Army of the Potomac, designing most of the corps badges.) Kearny was promoted to major general on July 4, 1862, in a blanket promotion of McClellan&#x27;s corps and division commanders.

===Death===


By the end of August 1862, General Kearny led his division at the disastrous Second Battle of Bull Run, which saw the Union Army routed and nearly destroyed by Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. The Union army retreated toward Washington and fought with the pursuing Confederate corps under Stonewall Jackson on September 1, 1862, at the Battle of Chantilly. In a violent storm with lightning and pouring rain, Kearny decided to investigate a gap in the Union line. Responding to warnings of a subordinate, he said, &quot;The Rebel bullet that can kill me has not yet been molded.&quot; Encountering Confederate troops, Kearny ignored a demand to surrender and, while he tried to escape on horseback, a &quot;half dozen muskets fired&quot; and he was shot with a Minié ball that entered his hip and came out his shoulder, killing him instantly. Confederate Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, upon hearing the gunfire, ran up to the body of the illustrious soldier with a lantern and exclaimed, &quot;You&#x27;ve killed Phil Kearny! He deserved a better fate than to die in the mud.&quot;

Kearny&#x27;s body was borne to the rear after the Confederates realized that a general officer had been killed. Confederate soldiers quickly proceeded to strip Kearny&#x27;s body of his coat, boots, pocket watch, papers, and other items of value. However, after it was realized who the deceased was, Robert E. Lee ordered all of his belongings returned over the objections of poorly clad soldiers who protested that a dead man no longer needed a warm coat and boots. Kearny&#x27;s papers were given to Lee for examination, but they merely consisted of personal letters to his wife and contained no useful military documents; Lee quickly burned them. General Lee sent his body back to Union forces, with a condolence note.

At the time of Kearny&#x27;s death, there were rumors in Washington that President Abraham Lincoln was contemplating replacing George B. McClellan with &quot;Kearny the Magnificent&quot;.

Kearny was buried at Trinity Churchyard in New York after his remains were transported from his residence in East Newark, New Jersey. In 1912, his remains were exhumed and re-interred at Arlington National Cemetery, where there is a statue by Edward Clark Potter in his honor, one of only two equestrian statues at Arlington. The re-interment drive was spearheaded by Medal of Honor recipient Charles F. Hopkins, who had served under General Kearny in the First New Jersey Brigade. The statue was dedicated by President Woodrow Wilson in November 1914. It was refurbished in 1996 by the General Philip Kearny Memorial Committee, a New Jersey nonprofit corporation.

<doc id="384516" wikidata="Q1658702" url="?curid=384516" title="Alder (crater)">
<text>Alder is a lunar impact crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It is located in the South Pole-Aitken basin, and lies to the southeast of the crater Von Kármán. Southeast of Alder is Bose, and to the south-southwest lies Boyle.

The inner wall of Alder is rough and slightly , with the material scattered across the edges of the otherwise relatively flat interior floor. There are several low central ridges lying along a band from the midpoint toward the eastern rim. A small crater lies on the eastern inner slopes. The crater is otherwise free of significant impacts within the rim.

Alder is associated with the only area in the basin not dominated by the pyroxene rocks typical of lunar lowlands. This &quot;alder ejecta&quot; area is on spectrographic evidence instead principally anorthosite rock, typical of the lunar highlands.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Alder.

<text>En Vogue is an American vocal girl group whose original lineup consisted of singers Terry Ellis, Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones. Formed in Oakland, California, in 1989, En Vogue reached No. 2 on the US Hot 100 with the single &quot;Hold On&quot;, taken from their 1990 debut album &quot;Born to Sing&quot;. The group&#x27;s 1992 follow-up album &quot;Funky Divas&quot; reached the top 10 in both the US and UK, and included their second US number two hit &quot;My Lovin&#x27; (You&#x27;re Never Gonna Get It)&quot; as well as the US top 10 hits &quot;Giving Him Something He Can Feel&quot; and &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;.

In 1996, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go (Love)&quot; became the group&#x27;s third, and most successful single, to reach number two in the US, and became their sixth number one on the US R&amp;B chart. Scoring more number one singles on the US R&amp;B chart than any other female group other than The Supremes. Robinson left the group in 1997 shortly before the release of their third album &quot;EV3&quot;, which reached the US and UK top 10. Jones left the group in 2001, Amanda Cole joined shortly thereafter. However, in 2003, Cole left the group, and Rhona Bennett joined the group during the recording of their album &quot;Soul Flower&quot;. In 2005, the original members briefly united before disassembling again. In 2009, the original members once again reunited for their &quot;En Vogue: 20th Anniversary&quot;. Shortly after the tour, Robinson and Jones again departed from En Vogue, with Bennett rejoining the group as a trio.

En Vogue has sold 20 million records worldwide. The group has won seven MTV Video Music Awards, three Soul Train Awards, two American Music Awards, and received seven Grammy nominations. They are the first and only female group to be awarded the Sammy Davis Jr. Award for Entertainer of the Year. In December 1999, Billboard magazine ranked the band as the 19th most successful recording artist of the 1990s. They ranked as the second most successful female group of the 1990s. In March 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named the group the ninth most-successful girl group of all time. Two of the group&#x27;s singles ranks in &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; most successful girl group songs of all-time list, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go (Love)&quot; (#12) and &quot;Hold On &quot; (#23). &quot;Billboard&quot; lists them as the third most successful female R&amp;B group of the past 25 years, after TLC and Destiny&#x27;s Child and seventh most successful group overall.

==History==
===1989–1991: Formation and &quot;Born to Sing&quot;===
In the late-1980s, when they were assembling their 1989 compilation project &quot;FM2&quot; for Atlantic Records, Oakland-based production and songwriting duo Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy first conceived the idea of a modern-day girl group in the tradition of commercially successful female bands that flourished in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Foster and McElroy envisioned an entertainment unit with interchangeable but not identical parts in which every member would qualify to take the lead vocals on any given number. Thus, their plan was to recruit singers who possessed strong voices, noticeably good looks, and intelligence. Approximately 3,000 women attended the auditions held in 1988, with Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones making the final cut. Conceived as a trio, Foster and McElroy decided to create a quartet after hearing the audition of Terry Ellis whose plane had been late from Houston, Texas. At first, they selected the band name 4-U but soon shifted to Vogue, ultimately settling on En Vogue, upon learning that another group had already claimed the Vogue name.

After forming, the group began working with their producers on their debut album. Recording began in August 1989 and wrapped up in December of the same year.
&quot;Born to Sing&quot; was released on April 3, 1990. The album peaked at No. 21 on the Billboard 200 chart and No. 3 on Billboard&#x27;s R&amp;B Albums Chart. The first single, &quot;Hold On,&quot; was released to radio in late February 1990 and became a crossover pop hit, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, and No. 1 on both the R&amp;B singles and Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts. It later went to No. 5 in the UK and became a hit in Europe. The next two singles, &quot;Lies&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Worry,&quot; each went to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts, while the fourth and final single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go,&quot; charted at No. 3 on the Billboard R&amp;B. The album was later certified platinum by the RIAA.

&quot;Hold On&quot; was awarded a Billboard Music Award for &quot;#1 R&amp;B Single of the Year,&quot; a Soul Train Award for R&amp;B/Urban Contemporary Single of the Year, Group, Band or Duo and have been nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. In 1990, En Vogue signed an endorsement deal to appear in a Diet Coke commercial directed by Spike Lee.

===1992–1994: &quot;Funky Divas,&quot; &quot;Runaway Love&quot; and touring===

En Vogue&#x27;s second album, &quot;Funky Divas&quot;, was released in the spring of 1992. The album debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Billboard R&amp;B and ultimately doubled the take of its predecessor, going triple platinum. The album&#x27;s first two singles: &quot;My Lovin&#x27; (You&#x27;re Never Gonna Get It)&quot; and &quot;Giving Him Something He Can Feel&quot; both went top 10 and peaked at No. 1 on the R&amp;B charts. The next single, &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; also went top 10. The final two singles &quot;Give It Up Turn It Loose&quot; and &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; both were top 40 hits. The album went on to sell more than five million copies, won an American Music Award for &quot;Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album,&quot; and was nominated for five Grammy Awards. The music video for &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; earned the group three MTV Video Music Awards for Best Choreography, Best Dance Video, and Best R&amp;B Video. They were honored with Soul Train&#x27;s Entertainer of the Year Award. In addition to this, the group was featured in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Essence&quot;, and other major publications. Riding on success of &quot;Funky Divas&quot;, a six-song EP titled &quot;Runaway Love&quot; was released in the fall of 1993, spawning the hit &quot;Runaway Love.&quot;

The group was signed to an endorsement deal with Converse, and was featured as an opening act on Luther Vandross&#x27; 1993 &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; Tour. England, Germany, the Netherlands, and France were among the numerous countries toured. However, according to an article in &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine, Vandross (by his own admission in interviews) and his entourage clashed with the members of En Vogue during the tour, and he vowed never to work with them again. En Vogue made numerous television appearances on such series as &quot;In Living Color&quot;, &quot;A Different World&quot;, &quot;Roc&quot; and &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot; (the latter two in which they also sang the shows&#x27; theme songs). In 1993, En Vogue was featured on Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s top 10 hit &quot;Whatta Man&quot;, from Salt-N-Pepa&#x27;s album &quot;Very Necessary&quot;. The track appeared (slightly edited) on En Vogue&#x27;s &quot;Runaway Love&quot; EP.

===1994–1998: The departure of Robinson and &quot;EV3&quot;===
In 1995, En Vogue was among numerous African American female vocalists featured on the song &quot;Freedom&quot; for the soundtrack to Mario Van Peebles&#x27;s film &quot;Panther&quot; (1995). Also in 1995, while band members Cindy Herron and Maxine Jones went on maternity leave, Ellis recorded and released a solo album titled &quot;Southern Gal&quot;, which spun off the top 10 R&amp;B single &quot;Where Ever You Are.&quot; The same year, the band made a cameo appearance in Joel Schumacher&#x27;s superhero film &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. In 1996, En Vogue recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go (Love)&quot; for the soundtrack to the motion picture &quot;Set It Off&quot;. Released as the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single in the fall 1996, it became the group&#x27;s biggest hit yet, selling over 1.8 million copies worldwide and becoming certified platinum by the RIAA. In response to the large commercial success of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go (Love),&quot; the group worked on their third studio album. As the album was nearing completion, Robinson chose to leave the group in March 1997 after contractual negotiations reached a stalemate. Despite Robinson&#x27;s abrupt departure, Ellis, Herron, and Jones continued on as a trio.

Following Robinson&#x27;s departure from the group, the remaining trio re-recorded several of her original lead vocals for their forthcoming album &quot;EV3&quot;, released in June 1997. A breakaway from previous projects, it marked En Vogue&#x27;s first project to include a diverse roster of collaborators including credits from Babyface, David Foster, Diane Warren, Andrea Martin, and Ivan Matias along with regular contributors Foster and McElroy. Upon its release, &quot;EV3&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the band&#x27;s vocal performances but were critical with overall production of the album. In the U.S., it debuted at number eight on both &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with sales of 76,500 units, the band&#x27;s highest first-week numbers. Two further singles released from the album, &quot;Whatever&quot; and &quot;Too Gone, Too Long&quot;, entered the top 20 and top 40 the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively.

In 1998, En Vogue recorded the song &quot;No Fool No More&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; (1998). A top 40 entry on the New Zealand Singles Chart, it was later included on the band&#x27;s first compilation album &quot;Best of En Vogue&quot;, released in June 1999. A moderate success, the album reached the top 40 in Austria and the United Kingdom.

===2000–2003: &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; and new member===
&quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, the group&#x27;s fourth studio album, was released in May 2000. Their first project with Elektra Records, the trio worked exclusively with their founders on the album who made heavy use of samples from classical music and traditional pop music to construct songs for recording. Preceded by leading single &quot;Riddle&quot;, the album received a mixed reception from critics upon its release, who were divided by its overall sound, and became a commercial disappointment, reaching number 33 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number 67 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 only. While &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; and &quot;Riddle&quot; fared better in international territories, its poor performance resulted in the release of no further singles from the album and the band was soon dropped from the Elektra company.

In 2001, Jones had announced her desire to spend more time with her daughter and departed the group. With Ellis and Herron wanting to continue performing En Vogue, singer-songwriter Amanda Cole joined as a performing member after submitting a demo. The following year, Ellis, Herron, and Cole collaborated with Timothy Eaton on the holiday album &quot;The Gift of Christmas&quot;, featuring four original songs and eight cover versions of Christmas standards and carols. Released in fall 2002 through Discretion Records, it failed to chart. In December 2002, the trio gave a concert at the Alabama State Fairgrounds in Birmingham, Alabama which was recorded and released, along with bonus footage, on a DVD and live album through Charly Records in 2004. Cole, who felt increasingly limited vocally and creatively, decided to leave the band in favor of a solo career soon after, with singer and actress Rhona Bennett joining after being recommended to Denzel Foster through a mutual friend and songwriting partner.

===2004–2008: &quot;Soul Flower&quot; and impromptu reunion===

With Bennett, the trio began work on their sixth album &quot;Soul Flower&quot;. Produced by Ellis and Herron, it was made independently through their own label Funkigirl Records as well as Foster and McElory&#x27;s 33rd Street Records, and distribution was handled through an outside deal with Bayside Entertainment. Released to mixed reviews from critics, who noted its mellower tone, the album failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but reached number 47 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 15 on the Independent Albums charts. Its two singles, &quot;Losin&#x27; My Mind&quot; and &quot;Ooh Boy&quot;, reached the top 40 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult R&amp;B Songs chart. During the latter part of 2004, En Vogue traveled three months in Europe as part of the Night of the Proms concerts series, with Jones rejoining the group to fill the place of Herron, who went on maternity leave. The Ellis/Bennett/Jones performing incarnation of the group headlined Lifetime&#x27;s fifth annual &quot;WomenRock!&quot; alongside Blondie, Angie Stone, and several others. Performing several of their hits, co-headliner Kelly Clarkson joined them for a rendition of &quot;Free Your Mind.&quot;

In 2005, Herron and Robinson rejoined En Vogue, and Bennett withdrew from the group. The original four signed with one of the industry&#x27;s largest management firms, the Firm Management Group, and began soliciting material for a new studio album which was expected to be released through Los Angeles-based Movemakers and Funkigirl Records. That September, the band joined Salt-N-Pepa for their first joint public performance of their 1994 single &quot;Whatta Man&quot; at &quot;VH1 Hip Hop Honors&quot;, and briefly toured together. The quartet also collaborated with Stevie Wonder and Prince on the backing vocals and music video for &quot;So What the Fuss&quot; from Wonder&#x27;s 2005 &quot;A Time to Love&quot; album, which received a Grammy nomination at the 48th award ceremony in 2006.

After failing to agree on business terms, Robinson once again chose to defect from En Vogue, and Bennett returned to complete the quartet. As a result, En Vogue was let go from the Firm and an album full of new original material did not materialize. En Vogue continued to perform with Ellis, Herron, Jones, and Bennett on selected spot dates in North America, Europe, and Japan. During this time, they teamed with Flemish singer Natalia Druyts on a remix version of her song &quot;Glamorous&quot; which featured lead vocals by Bennett. Released as the second single from Druyts&#x27;s third studio-album &quot;Everything and More&quot; (2007), it reached number two on the Ultratop 50 of the Flemish region of Belgium and launched the six-part &quot;Natalia Meets En Vogue feat. Shaggy&quot; concert series at the Antwerps Sportpaleis in January 2008.

===2008–2015: Robinson&#x27;s return and lawsuits===

On June 24, 2008, the original lineup of En Vogue appeared on the BET Awards, where they performed a medley with Alicia Keys, SWV and TLC as a tribute to girl groups of the 1990s. Complimented by the media, who declared their performance one of the evening&#x27;s highlights, and with people buzzing about the industry return of the original band, the quartet talked about being united on a permanent basis. In August, after performing during selected spot dates, the original members announced their reformation for their 20th Anniversary World Tour which coincided with the release of their debut album &quot;Born to Sing&quot; (1990) and led them to tour North America, Europe and Japan. In 2009, En Vogue along with singers Beyoncé, John Legend, and Ne-Yo, performed at the Essence Music Festival, held at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans.

Again, new material with Robinson failed to materialize, and in 2010, Herron, Ellis, and Jones signed with René Moore&#x27;s Rufftown Records in a deal that was to include two albums and touring. While the trio finished several songs for a new album, including promotional single &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Later&quot; which was sent to select urban adult contemporary radio stations on September 26, 2011, the comeback stalled and Jones left the band once more. In August 2012, Jones and Robinson announced that they would potentially record a group album together under the name Heirs to the Throne. While Herron and Ellis continued to tour as En Vogue along with a rejoined Bennett,
Jones and Robinson added singer Shaunté Usual to their lineup. However, in 2013, Robinson chose not to begin a new group with her former band member and instead joined the cast of the TV One reality show &quot;R&amp;B Divas: Los Angeles&quot;. Meanwhile, Jones began touring with singers Alison Carney and Maria Freeman as her new lineup of En Vogue, titled En Vogue to the Max. Jones later lost the right to use the En Vogue name after Herron and Ellis had filed suit against her for unauthorized use of the name, and a judge ruled that Herron and Ellis, as holders of the group&#x27;s LLC, had exclusive rights to the group&#x27;s name. Jones went solo and began recording her own original material, releasing her debut single &quot;Didn&#x27;t I&quot; and a new ballad version of the En Vogue hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go (Love)&quot; with Australian singer Greg Gould.

In July 2014, Bennett, Ellis, and Herron signed a new contract with Pyramid Records and began work on the album &quot;Electric Café&quot; with mentors Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy. In November, the trio appeared on the Lifetime holiday film &quot;An En Vogue Christmas&quot; in which they played fictional versions of themselves, reuniting to perform a benefit concert to save the nightclub where they got their start. The original movie featured En Vogue&#x27;s hit singles as well as two new tracks and a rendition of &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, later released digitally through En Vogue Records. In February 2015, Rufftown sued Ellis and Herron for over US $300 million, claiming the duo violated an exclusive recording contract by signing with Pyramid, alleging breach of contract, negligence, interference and fraud. Settled out of court, it resulted in the release of the extended play &quot;Rufftown Presents En Vogue&quot; in April 2015, which contained four songs recorded during their time with Rufftown, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Later&quot;.

===2016–present: &quot;Electric Café &quot; and touring===
In 2016, En Vogue released &quot;Deja Vu,&quot; the first promotional single from &quot;Electric Café&quot;, through their own label En Vogue Records after signing with Entertainment One Music. The following year, they embarked on the For the Love of Music Tour. The European tour launched on April 6, 2017 in Dublin, Ireland and concluded in Bremen, Germany on April 25. Also in 2017, the trio released three further singles from their forthcoming effort, including buzz singles &quot;I&#x27;m Good&quot; and &quot;Have a Seat&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg as well as Ne-Yo-penned lead single &quot;Rocket&quot;, the latter of which became their first top 10 hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult R&amp;B Songs chart in over 20 years.

In April 2018, En Vogue began the second leg of their European Tour in support of their seventh full-length studio album &quot;Electric Café&quot;. The same month, the album, their first studio project in 14 years, was released. A blend of neo soul, pop, and contemporary R&amp;B with electronic dance music, the trio worked with Raphael Saadiq, Dem Jointz, Curtis &quot;Sauce&quot; Wilson as well as regular contributors Foster &amp; McElroy on most of the album. &quot;Electric Café&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the band for their vocal performances but found the material too generic and uneven. In the United States, the album debuted at number 14 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Independent Albums and reached the Top Album Sales chart. A second and final single from the album, &quot;Reach 4 Me&quot; became a top 20 hit on US Adult R&amp;B Songs Chart in August 2018.

In July 2019, the group performed on the song &quot;I Got You (Always and Forever)&quot; alongside Chance the Rapper, Kierra Sheard, and Ari Lennox on the rapper&#x27;s album &quot;The Big Day&quot;. In October 2019, original members Robinson and Jones reunited with Ellis, Herron, and Bennett for an on-stage performance to salute music industry executive Sylvia Rhone at the City of Hope Gala 2019, marking the first time all five members performed together. Plans to reunite permanently for another concert tour in support of their 30th anniversary in 2020, failed to materialize when the four original members could not agree on whether Bennett should once again step down as a non-original member.

In October 2020, the trio of Ellis, Herron, and Bennett closed out the 2020 Billboard Music Awards, performing &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;. The following year, the group made a cameo in the romantic comedy sequel &quot;Coming 2 America&quot; alongside Salt-N-Pepa.

In 2022, En Vogue competed in season seven of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the &quot;Queen Cobras&quot; of Team Bad. The trio narrowly missed out on a spot in the finale of the singing competition as they were eliminated on the week of May 4 alongside Shaggy as &quot;Space Bunny&quot; of Team Cuddly. The same year, the band embarked on the Mixtape Tour alongside New Kids on the Block, Salt-N-Pepa, and Rick Astley.

In the summer of 2023, En Vogue joined TLC and Shaggy on the Hot Summer Nights tour, and performed as the headlining pop group for the 2023 Boston Pops Orchestra Fireworks Spectacular on July 4, 2023. Later that year, they performed &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

In May and June 2024, the group returned to London, England for the first time since 2018 for performances at the Cross the Tracks and Mighty Hoopla 2024 festivals, also performing at summer festivals in the United States and in CNN&#x27;s &quot;The Fourth in America&quot; in July.

In February 2025, En Vogue performed at the NBA All-Star Game 2025 halftime show alongside music acts E-40, Too Short, Saweetie and DJ Cassidy, with former member Maxine Jones rejoining the group.

<text>&quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; is a 1995 comic book crossover storyline mostly published in the X-Men franchise of books by Marvel Comics. The &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; briefly replaced the universe of Earth-616 and had ramifications in the main Marvel Comics universe when the original timeline was restored. It was later retconned as having occurred in the alternate universe of Earth-295.

During the entirety of the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; event the regularly published X-Men comics were replaced by new X-Men related mini series, focusing on various teams and individuals in the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; world including &quot;X-Calibre&quot;, &quot;Gambit and the X-Ternals&quot;, &quot;Generation Next&quot;, &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, &quot;Amazing X-Men&quot;, &quot;Weapon X&quot;, &quot;Factor X&quot;, &quot;X-Man&quot; and &quot;X-Universe&quot;. The event was bookended by two one shots, &quot;X-Men Alpha&quot; and &quot;X-Men Omega&quot;.

The storyline starts with Legion (David Haller), a psychotic mutant who traveled back in time to kill Magneto before he can commit various crimes against humanity. Legion accidentally kills Professor Charles Xavier, his father, leading to a major change in the timeline. The death of Professor Xavier leads Apocalypse to attack 10 years sooner than he did in the original timeline, taking control of Earth and altering everything that happened from that point forward. Apocalypse is opposed by several factions of mutant resistance, including a group led by Magneto. The group manages to send the mutant Bishop back in time to prevent the murder of Professor Xavier, undoing the entire timeline.

In 2005, Marvel published an &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; one-shot and miniseries to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the fan favorite event. The book looks at what happened after the end of the original story, revealing that the timeline became in fact an alternate earth, designated &quot;Earth-295&quot;. The &quot;Dark Angel Saga&quot; in 2011 revisited the alternate reality once more, leading to an &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; ongoing series launched in 2012 that ran for 14 issues. The world was also featured as part of Marvel&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot;.

==Storyline==
Legion (David Haller), a psychotic mutant on Earth and son of Professor Charles Xavier, travels back in time with the intention of killing Magneto (Erik Lehnsherr). However, Legion travels to a time when Magneto and Xavier are still friends while in Israel. As Xavier dies trying to protect Magneto, Legion vanishes, and a new timeline is created. The only person aware of how history has changed is Lucas Bishop, a time traveling mutant who followed Legion.

Because of Xavier&#x27;s sacrifice, Magneto comes to believe in his late friend&#x27;s dream of a peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur), an immortal mutant villain, was monitoring the fight. He chooses this moment as the perfect time to begin his world conquest, which did not happen in the mainstream Marvel universe for another ten years.

Magneto assembles the X-Men just as Apocalypse begins his war. Despite the X-Men&#x27;s resistance, Apocalypse conquers all of North America and eventually mutants are considered the ruling class. Apocalypse initiates a genocidal campaign called &quot;cullings,&quot; killing millions of humans. To further ensure that no one is left to challenge him or undo the circumstances that led to his reign, he has everyone with telepathic or chronal abilities hunted down. Meanwhile, the changes in the timeline result in a destructive crystallization wave created by the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal.

===&quot;X-Men: Alpha&quot;===
&quot;X-Men: Alpha&quot; was published in January 1995 and launched the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; crossover story. It briefly shows readers how many popular X-Men characters have changed in this new world. Bishop is reunited with Magneto while retaining fragmented memories of the true timeline. Magneto assigns his X-Men and their allies various missions. Some are to gather the forces needed to change history while others will continue resisting Apocalypse. The story continues in eight interlocking miniseries, each focusing on a different team of X-Men or other mutant forces. Each miniseries temporarily replaced one of the monthly X-Men titles being published at the time.

===&quot;X-Calibre&quot;===
X-Calibre is a team built around Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner), who is sent by Magneto to locate Destiny (Irene Adler), a mutant capable of seeing into the future, so that she can verify Bishop&#x27;s story. Nightcrawler must travel to Avalon, a secret refuge where mutants and humans live together in peace. Along his journey, he encounters John Proudstar (Thunderbird), the monk Cain, the pirate Callisto, and his mother Mystique (Raven Darkholme). The chief antagonists for Nightcrawler&#x27;s journey consist of the Pale Riders, a trio of Apocalypse&#x27;s servants made up of Moonstar (Danielle Moonstar), Damask (Emma Steed), Dead Man Wade (Wade Wilson) and the Shadow King (Amahl Farouk). Nightcrawler&#x27;s team consists of Mystique, Switchback, and later Damask, who joins Nightcrawler after realizing the beauty Avalon has to offer. The &quot;X-Calibre&quot; series gets its name from an in-joke between Nightcrawler and his mother, Mystique, because of the caliber of bullets she uses, simply stamped with an &quot;X&quot;. This title replaced &quot;Excalibur&quot;.

===&quot;Gambit and the X-Ternals&quot;===
Gambit (Remy LeBeau)&#x27;s X-Ternals consist of Sunspot (Roberto de Costa), Jubilee (Jubilation Lee), Strong Guy (Guido Carosella) and Lila Cheney. They are sent deep into space using Lila&#x27;s teleportation in order to retrieve a shard of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal, essential to the verification of Bishop&#x27;s alternate reality. The X-Ternals are pursued by Rictor, a henchman of Apocalypse desperate to earn his master&#x27;s praise by killing Gambit. Upon reaching Shi&#x27;ar space, the X-ternals fight the Imperial Guard in order to retrieve the crystal shard. Upon their return to Earth, Strong Guy betrays the team, not only stealing the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal, but also kidnapping Magneto&#x27;s son, Charles. This title replaced &quot;X-Force&quot;.

===&quot;Generation Next&quot;===
Generation Next consists of a young group of mutant students trained by the husband and wife team of Colossus (Piotr &quot;Peter&quot; Rasputin) and Shadowcat (Katherine Pryde-Rasputin). They consist of Chamber (Jonothan &quot;Jono&quot; Starsmore), Husk (Paige Guthrie), Mondo, Vincente Cimetta, and Skin (Angelo Espinoza). They are sent by Magneto into the Seattle Core to rescue Colossus&#x27; sister, Illyana Rasputin, who is the last surviving transdimensional teleporter. Illyana Rasputin is a slave of the Sugar Man, one of Apocalypse&#x27;s prefects and ruler of the Seattle Core. Mondo finds Illyana Rasputin and hides her inside of his body, intending to smuggle her out at shift change. When Mondo is found out, the ensuing fight finds the Sugar Man killing Mondo with a blast from his tongue, exposing the rest of Generation Next. While fighting a near hopeless battle, Generation Next is left for dead by Colossus, who sacrifices them in order to save his sister. This title replaced &quot;Generation X&quot;.

===&quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;===
The Astonishing X-Men are led by Rogue (Anna Marie Lehnsherr, Magneto&#x27;s wife) and consist of Sabretooth (Victor Creed), Blink (Clarice Ferguson), Wild Child (Kyle Gibney), Morph (Kevin Sydney) and Sunfire (Shiro Yoshida). They are sent by Magneto to stop the cullings, which are being undertaken by Holocaust, Apocalypse&#x27;s son and one of his horsemen. While helping with the evacuation and protection of humans, Sabretooth asks Blink to teleport him to Holocaust&#x27;s location, which she reluctantly does. Sabretooth and Holocaust fight a vicious duel but Sabretooth is defeated and seemingly killed, horrifying Blink. (Sabretooth had rescued Blink from Mr. Sinister and she had come to see him as her dearest friend and mentor.) The team then fights Holocaust and his Infinites, destroying his factory. However, Holocaust manages to escape and the team returns to Xavier&#x27;s mansion, where Rogue learns that both her son and her husband have been captured. Sabretooth is revealed by Iceman to have survived the battle, to Blink&#x27;s delight. This title replaced &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;.

===&quot;Amazing X-Men&quot;===
The Amazing X-Men consist of team leader Quicksilver (Pietro Lehnsherr) and Storm (Ororo Munroe), Dazzler (Alison Blaire), Banshee (Sean Cassidy), Iceman (Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Drake), and Exodus (Paris Bennet). The team is sent to Maine by Magneto to aid in the evacuation of humanity to Europe. During this mission, the team fights Apocalypse&#x27;s Brotherhood of Chaos, as well as the Horseman Abyss, who is defeated (but not killed) by Quicksilver. During their absence from the Xavier Mansion, Magneto and Bishop are attacked by Apocalypse himself, who captures them both. Fulfilling their mission, Quicksilver splits up his team to help the other X-Men: sending Iceman to rendezvous with Rogue&#x27;s team (the Astonishing X-Men) and Dazzler and Exodus to find Magneto&#x27;s son, Charles. Finally, Quicksilver, Storm, and Banshee go to rescue Bishop, who is in the hands of the Madri, Apocalypse&#x27;s priests. This title replaced &quot;X-Men&quot;.

===&quot;Weapon X&quot;===
Weapon X (Logan) and his lover Jean Grey are depicted in this series carrying out missions for the Human High Council. Jean and Weapon X drift apart, as the Human High Council intends to launch a nuclear strike on the U.S. as Jean is appalled by the loss of life it would cause. After Weapon X concludes a battle with Donald Pierce, Jean leaves to help evacuate the U.S., bidding a tearful farewell to Logan. Weapon X is then sent to recruit Gateway, whose teleportation ability is necessary to bring the fleet to America. As the fleet leaves, Weapon X decides to join them, if only to find Jean somewhere in America before the bombs are dropped. This title temporarily replaced &quot;Wolverine&quot;.

===&quot;Factor X&quot;===
Factor X consists of the Elite Mutant Force (EMF), who serve Apocalypse. They are split into five sibling groups: Cyclops and Havok (Scott Summers and Alex Summers), Emplate and the Twins (Marius, Nicole, and Claudette St. Croix), Cannonball and Amazon (Sam and Elizabeth Guthrie), the Bedlam Brothers (Jesse and Terrence Aaronson), and Aurora and Northstar (Jean-Marie and Jean-Paul Beaubier). The EMF is tasked with maintaining control of Apocalypse&#x27;s breeding pens, where people are imprisoned, tortured, and experimented on by the Beast, also a member of the EMF. Havok, jealous of his brother&#x27;s leadership role, discovers that Cyclops is a traitor who has been helping people escape the pens; and in one such escape attempt, both Aurora and Northstar are seriously injured. Havok then exposes Cyclops and attempts to kill him, but Cyclops escapes with the aid of Jean Grey, who has arrived to evacuate as many people as she can before the Human High Council&#x27;s nuclear strike. The Bedlam Brothers also choose to side with Cyclops, and they successfully defeat both Amazon and Cannonball. Cyclops and Jean defeat Havok, and as they lead the freed prisoners out of the pens, Havok is determined to kill his brother. This title replaced &quot;X-Factor&quot;.

===&quot;X-Man&quot;===
The protagonist of &quot;X-Man&quot; is Nate Grey, a mutant born of Cyclops&#x27; and Jean Grey&#x27;s DNA, and the most powerful telekinetic in the world. He lives under the guidance of his father figure Forge, who leads a group of outcasts consisting of Mastermind, Toad, Brute, and Sauron, who attack trains and factories of Apocalypse while masquerading as a theatre troupe. This title replaced &quot;Cable&quot;.

==Characters and affiliations==

===Mutant heroes===
The only then-existing major mutant character missing in the original Age of Apocalypse is Psylocke. When the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline was revisited a decade later, she appeared in &quot;X-Men: Age of Apocalypse&quot; #4 in Asian form. Her origin remains unknown. There has been no explanation of what she was doing during the original Age of Apocalypse, other than the fact that she had some kind of past connection with Weapon X.

===Other anti-Apocalypse forces===
Besides the X-Men and its many offshoots, the Human High Council remains as the only other power opposing Apocalypse. Unlike the X-Men, however, the Human High Council considers the extermination of mutants as a viable option. Bolivar and Moira Trask, as well as Brian Braddock, are the major proponents for a mutant holocaust. Secretly, the Human High Council supports the Human Underground Resistance.

&quot;X-Universe&quot; also reveals the fate of several non-mutants individuals. Peter Parker was executed because he was a potential contact for Gwen Stacy. T&#x27;Challa and Namor perished when Wakanda and Atlantis were attacked by Apocalypse. Frank Castle went missing following a mutant raid on a Buddhist temple where he had sought peace after the death of his family. Reed Richards and Johnny Storm sacrificed themselves in the evacuation of Manhattan Island.

===Apocalypse&#x27;s agents===
===Neutrals===
===Timeline escapees===
Some characters escaped the Age of Apocalypse into the Earth-616 continuity. These include Dark Beast, Nate Grey (the Age of Apocalypse version of Cable), Blink, Holocaust and Sugar Man.

* Nate Grey allied himself with the X-Men a few times and once with Spider-Man. He later &quot;died&quot; by disseminating into every life form on the Earth, but has since returned to the living.
* Blink escaped into the multiverse and ended up leading the reality-hopping team of heroes known as the Exiles. Her counterpart on Earth-616 was thought to have died during the &quot;Phalanx Covenant&quot; storyline, but brought back from the dead by Selene during the &quot;Necrosha&quot; event.
* Prophet was taken at Jean Grey&#x27;s request to the Earth-616 at the end of the crossover that would close the Age of Apocalypse timeline from the timestream.

===Former timeline escapees===
* Holocaust remained at large in the main Marvel Universe until he joined the Exiles and was killed by another universe&#x27;s evil version of Hyperion.
* Sabretooth survived through the same means as Blink and joined a team of reality-hopping super beings known as Weapon X. During one mission, he opted to stay behind on to raise David Richards. Eventually, he was brought back into action and joined the Exiles. He has since returned to the Age of Apocalypse.
* Hatchet-9, the only surviving Mecha-Mutate officer of Assault-Regiment Delta, a regiment of traitor humans who traded limbs and more for the power and privilege of serving the High Lord Apocalypse.
* Rastus, a heavily two-headed mutated creation of Sugar Man and one of many wardens of Seattles&#x27; Core, was also revealed to have escaped to Earth-616. He joined Sugar Man and lived in the catacombs underneath the island nation of Genosha until he was accidentally discovered by the Dark Beast. He was eventually killed by Callisto.
* Wild Child left this timeline when a time-traveler, Quentin Quire, saved him from the Friends of Humanity and then used Wild Child to replace the latter&#x27;s counterpart, who had recently died. Wild Child was later returned to the Age of Apocalypse and subsequently killed in battle.
* Nightcrawler decided to stay on Earth-616 after the events of the Dark Angel Saga. He joined the X-Force team so he could search for Iceman, Blob, Dark Beast and Sugar Man. He then tracked and killed his former teammates Iceman and Blob. During the X-Termination crossover, Nightcrawler apparently gave his own life to close the Age of Apocalypse timeline from the Timestream.
* Blob left the Age of Apocalypse due to the events put in motion by Archangel. He later joined Daken&#x27;s Brotherhood with the apparent goal of exacting revenge on X-Force. He was killed by the AoA Nightcrawler who teleported a shark inside Blob&#x27;s body.
* Iceman was revealed to have defected from the X-Men and was working for Weapon Omega. He also left the Age of Apocalypse through the same means as Blob and was tracked down by Wolverine, Deadpool, and the AoA Nightcrawler. During the fight, Nightcrawler teleported to a factory and fought Iceman, defeating him without either man using their powers. Once Iceman was defeated, Nightcrawler threw his body into an incinerator.
* Beast was sent twenty years into Earth-616&#x27;s past. This allowed for several retcons which were used to explain that he (now known as Dark Beast) was responsible for the creation of the Morlocks and also why Mister Sinister initiated the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot;, as he recognized his stolen handiwork and ordered it exterminated as a debasement of his art. He later came under the employment of Norman Osborn&#x27;s Dark X-Men, with the responsibility of keeping his counterpart and Charles Xavier captive while Osborn carried out his plan. He then returned to the Age of Apocalypse timeline and helped Weapon Omega on his quest to control America, but at the end Weapon Omega was defeated and Dark Beast was taken back to Earth-616. He was thought to be deceased, after apparently dying in a bomb explosion after progressively suffering from fatal health problems due to his own further experimentations on himself. During the 2017 Secret Empire storyline, Dark Beast turns up alive and healthy but is eventually killed by Magik.
*Sugar Man was also sent twenty years into Earth-616&#x27;s past, and it was through him the Genegineer received the advanced genetic research to allow the small nation of Genosha to become powerful by enslaving mutants. He remained at large in the main Marvel Universe and only a few knew about his existence. Sugar Man returned to the Age of Apocalypse timeline after being released from Steve Rogers&#x27; custody by Dark Beast, and was believed to remain there at the end of the crossover that would close the Age of Apocalypse timeline. But it was revealed that he had returned to the main reality before the event and was thought to be deceased at the hands of Magneto, only to reappear alive and planning to send six hundred mutant embryos to the future. He was later killed by a mysterious assailant who was hunting down the former Age of Apocalypse residents.

== Alternate versions ==
=== &quot;What If... The Age of Apocalypse Had Not Ended?&quot; ===
An alternate AoA reality was presented when Magneto, giving up on Bishop&#x27;s mission in the final moments, rescued his family from the nuclear explosions alongside some of his allies. Magneto, Rogue, Sunfire, Quicksilver, and Weapon X found themselves working with the last remaining human heroes (including Tony Stark, Invisible Woman and Gwen Stacy, the latter of which formed a romance with Quicksilver) to deal with a new threat: the Coming of Galactus.
As there was no Fantastic Four, it fell to the survivors to work against Galactus and his herald, the Silver Surfer. As the heroes sprung into action, Night-Thrasher ended up using advanced technology to empower himself with amazing psychic powers. Together, they were able to do the impossible and claim victory. After Weapon X used his adamantium claws to slay the Silver Surfer, the collective psychic potential of humanity was focused against Galactus, eventually killing him.

==Prequels==
Before the tenth anniversary, the Age of Apocalypse was considered a dead reality that no longer existed—a fact that was frequently mentioned by timeline escapees, such as Sugar Man and Blink. However, there were quite a few prequels written that took place before its destruction.

&quot;By the Light&quot; told the story of Blink transporting the X-Men to the moon where they faced Apocalypse&#x27;s new horseman of Death, Maximus the Mad. &quot;Sinister Bloodlines&quot; followed the return of a Brood-infected Christopher Summers (Corsair) to Earth and his reunion, after escaping the experimentations of Sinister and Dark Beast, with Scott and Alex.

&quot;Blink&quot; was a four issue miniseries intended to reintroduce the Age of Apocalypse version of Blink as a teaser to the &quot;Exiles&quot; ongoing series. This story takes place prior to the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; main events, but is largely set in the Negative Zone. Blink becomes lost in the Negative Zone after attempting to incite Blastaar towards war with Apocalypse and instead joins a rebellion against Blastaar alongside her lover, who turns out to be a de-evolved version of Annihilus. The last four pages of the final issue show Blink during the destruction of the Age of Apocalypse and becoming unhinged from time.

&quot;X-Man&quot;, during its run, occasionally re-visited the Age of Apocalypse, both through time travel and flashbacks. &quot;X-Man&quot; #-1 shows Mr. Sinister releasing Nate from his growth vat as a child to check on his progress. In the 1996 &quot;X-Man&quot; Annual, Sugar Man uses a variation on a time machine powered by Nate&#x27;s psionic force to return to the early years of Apocalypse&#x27;s rule where he hopes to take control himself. Nate follows and meets up with Forge, Magneto, Morph, and Mastermind, and is surprised to discover that Forge knew that he would be there because an older Nate Grey had time traveled and told Forge about his memories of this event. On the orders of this older Nate Grey, Forge forces the younger Nate to re-power the machine and return himself and Sugar Man to Earth-616. This leads to a rift between Forge and Magneto, who believed they should have allowed Nate to stay so that he could help them fight Apocalypse. Later, in &quot;X-Man&quot; #53 and #54, Nate, Jean Grey, and Cyclops run across a temporal rift that brings an infinite processing plant to Earth-616.

==Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary==

In 2005, Marvel published an &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; one-shot and miniseries to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the fan favorite event.

The one-shot features stories set before the events depicted in the original &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; event, similar in focus to the &quot;Tales from the Age of Apocalypse&quot; issues. The one-shot contains the story of how Colossus and Shadowcat left the X-Men to train Generation Next; how Sabretooth met Wild Child; the first appearance of the Silver Samurai; and how the world survived the Human High Council&#x27;s nuclear attack.

The limited series, which takes place after the nuclear attack in &quot;X-Men: Omega&quot;, introduced several characters who were not in the original storyline. Long time characters Cloak and Dagger, Psylocke, and the Morlocks (including Feral, Leech, Marrow, Skids, and Thornn), who were survivors of Mr. Sinister&#x27;s experiments, are introduced. Newer characters Beak, Icarus, and X-23 are seen along with an alternate version of Xorn. Jean Grey is also revealed to have saved everyone from the nuclear attack by tapping into the Phoenix Force-level powers, and is revived from death by Sinister.

==Dark Angel Saga==
In 2011, the Age of Apocalypse was featured in a storyline in the ongoing series &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; 11–18 by Rick Remender.

Seeking a Celestial &#x27;Life Seed&#x27; in order to save Angel (Warren Worthington) from becoming the new Apocalypse, The Uncanny X-Force, under the guidance of Dark Beast, journey to the Age of Apocalypse. X-Force arrives ten years after the X-Men had defeated Mister Sinister, yet it seems the X-Men still face enormous challenges in this harsh setting. The world, which during the previous appearance had seemed to be on the road to recovery, has once again fallen on hard times, similar to when Apocalypse was ruling, with Sentinels now roaming the streets. As they follow Dark Beast to one of his labs, they are unknowingly followed by Wildchild and Sabretooth (Earth-295). Dark Beast finds the life seed but before he could hand it over to the X-Force members, Nightcrawler teleports in and swipes the seed away, figuring that Dark Beast was up to some evil plot after decades of absence. After a brief quarrel which ended with the life seed destroyed by Sunfire, Psylocke recognizes Sabretooth from her time on the Exiles and convinces Wolverine (Earth-616) that this version of Sabretooth isn&#x27;t a bad guy, which ends their battle. With the life seed destroyed, Dark Beast sneaks over to the portal back to the 616 Marvel Universe and walks in, leaving X-Force stranded in the Age of Apocalypse world. Nightcrawler&#x27;s team, realizing that the sentinels are descending on their position, evacuates along with X-Force, taking them to the X-Men&#x27;s new base in Atlantis.

It was soon revealed that a new &quot;Heir of Apocalypse&quot; has risen and that&#x27;s the reason why the world as fallen once again into a Dark Age that resulted on the apparent extinction of the human race. Using a version of M.O.D.O.K., they discover the body of the slain Celestial which apparently still contains life seeds. However, as X-Force also learn that the only way to return to the main reality is to seek the help of Gateway who in turn is kept prisoner in the mysterious floating city known as The Sky, the Sentinels soon arrives at Atlantis forcing the group to abandon the complex. As Fantomex leads a small team to the place where the Celestial is, the rest of the team invades The Sky to retrieve Gateway, however they are confronted by the Black Legion, a group of psychotic and merciless killers under the service of the Heir of Apocalypse, consisting of Blob, Manphibian, Demon-Ock (a demonic creature with mechanical tentacles), Beta-Red (a female counterpart of Omega Red), Grimm Chamber (a Thing/Chamber hybrid), Iron Ghost (a Ghost Rider/Iron Man hybrid), Orange Hulk (a solar-powered Hulk), White Cloak (a Cloak/Dagger hybrid), Zombie Sentry (an undead version of Sentry) and Venomcap (Captain America bonded with a symbiote). During the fight, X-Force and the Earth-295 X-Men run into the long thought deceased &quot;Weapon X&quot; (Logan/Wolverine Earth-295). He appears using Apocalypse armor and reveals himself to be the Heir of Apocalypse.

Meanwhile, unaware of the problems Wolverine and his team are facing in the fortress, Fantomex and his small crew dive into the heart of the deceased Celestial in order to get the life seed they need to free Warren. After battling some drones, they manage to find only one seed and flee with it, losing Gambit in the battle, while, back in the fortress, Wolverine and his crew try to battle Weapon X and the Black Legion. However, Weapon X proves too powerful, since he had been augmented by the Celestial technology, when the cosmic entities came to judge planet Earth, and while he had ascended in form and power, his mind had become so twisted to the point of creating genetic-powerful warriors to kill Charles Lehnsherr, the infant son of Magneto and Rogue. Weapon X easily manages to swat them all and take Jean Grey so he could transform her into Death, a horseman of Apocalypse. To perform the ritual he approaches Storm who was enslaved and transform into a blind seer made of living stone. After taking out the Black Legion and freeing Gateway, Wolverine ask Gateway to open a portal to bring forth Fantomex team. Using Fantomex, they manage to free Jean and open a gateway to their world. Wolverine wants Jean to come too but she refuses and forces them through the gateway with her powers. As X-Force returns to their world, they are greeted by Dark Beast, the Horsemen of Apocalypse, and Archangel, now wearing Apocalypse&#x27;s armor.

After a long fight, Fantomex retreats and gets Gateway to teleport the AOA X-Men to help X-Force, together they defeat Archangel, the AoA X-Men decide to go back to their timeline while Nightcrawler decides to stay in this timeline and vows to kill, Dark Beast, Iceman, Sugar Man, and any other villain that escaped the AOA timeline to this one.

==Age of Apocalypse ongoing series==
===Publishing history===
In the &quot;Marvel Point One&quot; one-shot, a new team of anti-mutant humans calling themselves the X-Terminated, pledged to combat the rule of the ascended Weapon X and his minions, after X-Force&#x27;s attempt to stop the genocidal successor of Apocalypse. The group consisted of remaining members of the human race in the Age of Apocalypse who have been pushed to the edge of extinction by mutants. Members of that team were Prophet (William Stryker), Goodnight (a rebuilt Donald Pierce), Deadeye (Zora Risman), Fiend (Francesca Trask), and Horror Show (Graydon Creed).

===Plot summary===
As Jean Grey and Sabretooth returned from Earth-616, they meet the human coalition. It is also revealed that Jean had ordered much to Magneto&#x27;s horror, the creation of clones of the Scarlet Witch, so they could use the spell Jean saw previously on Wolverine&#x27;s mind that de-powered 99% of mutantkind. However Weapon X and his Black Legion attack the last human city where Weapon X himself slays both Magneto and Rogue, leaving Jean Grey and Sabretooth the last two X-Men alive (Sunfire had given his life to stop Archangel&#x27;s plans on Earth-616, and Nightcrawler decided to stay on that reality to hunt down Dark Beast, Blob, Iceman and Sugar Man). Jean telepathically nudges clones of the Scarlet Witch to recreate the Decimation and remove all mutants&#x27; powers across the globe. However, this was only successful within a radius of 12 feet, so Jean Grey and Sabretooth are both left de-powered while Weapon X and his forces remained powered. The human coalition distracts Weapon X with a bomb long enough for the group to escape as the city explodes behind them.

As the human coalition (X-Terminated Team, now including Jean Grey) continues to fight the forces of Weapon X, now renamed Weapon Omega, they find Harper Simmons, a human journalist from Earth-616 who was forced to come to the Age of Apocalypse while investigating the prison break of Sugar Man by Dark Beast on Earth-616. He creates a pamphlet that incites human and mutant riots against Weapon Omega, who is now bringing back deceased mutants like Emplate, Scott Summers and Alex Summers using energies siphoned from the celestial life seed. Harper Simons joins with the X-Terminated. Others who work with the X-Terminated are Doctor Moreau and Bolivar Trask.

After discovering the resurrected Penance, he ordered his servants Azazel, Cyclops and Colossus to bring her into the fold. She initially refused and undid Colossus&#x27; brainwashing causing him to abandon Weapon Omega and serve Penance. A fight broke out but Azazel agreed to leave. He returned with Weapon Omega who demanded that Penance kneel before him which she did. Unbeknownst to Weapon Omega however Penance was also making deals with the Human Resistance.

It has since been revealed that when the Celestials had come to Earth, they tried to resurrect Apocalypse by rewrite his genetic code to form a new body. After a small team of X-Men went investigate the ship they discovered that Apocalypse was already in the form of a child which Weapon X effectively kills despite Jean&#x27;s pleas. With the death of the child, Weapon X took on the role of the Evolutionary Caretaker in an effort to spare his world from the Celestials wrath. Thus, he restarted the campaigns of extermination perpetrated by Apocalypse against the human race after being corrupted by the Seed.

The X-Terminated later travel to Latveria so they could get the information they need to defeat Weapon Omega, as Doom had apparently managed to create a device capable of storing the Death Seed&#x27;s powers which they aptly referred to as the &quot;Apocalypse Force&quot; from its host body and empowering it within a new user, however they are approached by the Queen, actually Doom&#x27;s wife and former member of the Human High Council, Emma Frost, who had her telepathic powers returned to her and was now in league with Weapon Omega. The X-Terminated eventually gained the information they needed by killing Doom and removed the intel literally from his head.

With the information they gained, the X-Terminated build the device, however, Weapon Omega after being alerted that Jean Grey was hiding out in the city, resolved to hunt his wife down himself, and vowed that if her humanity could not be cured, he would kill her himself. Jean Grey was ultimately responsible for removing the power of the Death Seed within her former lover and were absorbed by Jean as the next host. Thanks to her history with the Phoenix Force, though, Jean was strong enough to reject the power of the Death Seed and displaced it. After everything died down, Weapon Omega emerged from the rubble as Logan once again, his mind now clear of the corrupting force of the Death Seed. Unknown to him or Jean, however, the energies of the seed had in fact been contained by Bolivar Trask in a giant machine under the Nevada Desert.

====&quot;X-Termination&quot;====
In March 2013, the &quot;X-Treme X-Men&quot;, &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot;, and &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; titles were part of the &quot;X-Termination&quot; crossover event, which focused on the AoA Nightcrawler&#x27;s trip home. &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; #14, the final issue of the series, will be Part 3 of the event.

Following the completion of his quest, Nightcrawler decided it was time to return home. Even though this world was in a much better state, he still missed his own and he wanted to return to fight Weapon Omega. After managing to avoid Wolverine, who was hunting him down, Nightcrawler eventually tracked down another exile from his world: Dark Beast, however, unbeknownst to them, due to the dimension-hopping activities of various superheroes and villains, the walls in the netherspace have become weak and began to crack.

The rift first became known on Earth-TRN262 in the head of the Sphinx. Lord Xavier, the Witch King, Nazi Xavier, and Xavier Head began sacrificing civilians to an interdimensional rift to gain power. The X-treme X-Men, who had been trying to stop this from happening by killing ten evil Xaviers across various realities before they could use their powers to trigger the event, were able to rescue their Xavier and narrowly defeated Lord Xavier and Nazi Xavier. Unfortunately, the X-treme X-Men did not act quickly enough to save that world, and were forced to make an interdimensional jump, leaving that reality and all its citizens being consumed by the vortex. Unbeknownst to them, an army of monsters were waiting on the other side of the portal.

Using a pair of modified goggles, which Dark Beast explains will allow them to enter the Dreaming Celestial safely in a bid to return home. Kurt teleports them inside, where McCoy attempts to open a portal to their home reality. However, before the portal stabilizes, the machine he was using begins to malfunction. Before he can fix it, the X-Men arrive and the two have to flee, with Nightcrawler teleporting them through the portal. However, once they arrive in their homeworld, the portal doesn&#x27;t close behind them, which worries the Dark Beast. The situation is complicated first by Wolverine&#x27;s team, which comes through the portal to take Kurt back to their reality, and then by Dazzler and her team of X-treme X-Men, who seem keen to close the portal. As Xavier of the X-treme X-Men uses his powers to try and close the portal three huge monsters emerge from it. Xavier tries to tell them they mean no harm but one of the monsters kills him and dissolves his body to absorb its energy. As it does so, it grows slightly bigger.

In response, Dazzler blasts one with her light beams, but it absorbs her energy and grows in size. After trying various methods of attack, the teams realize that the monsters are nearly invulnerable. Karma tries possessing one but it ends up possessing her. They find out that the monsters were trapped between dimensions by the Celestials and that the constant travelling between worlds has weakened the barriers and freed them. Karma is dying but Iceman freezes the monsters and saves Karma. As the teams regroup to try and figure out what to do, Sage picks up on some thought the monsters are projecting. She screams for someone to shut the portal down, but it&#x27;s too late and one of the monsters walks through it to the 616 universe. As Howlett, Wolverine, Northstar and Hercules go after it, the second monster heads off into New Apocalypse, whilst the third starts to drain energy from the portal itself. Prophet says that they could use the power of Apocalypse to defeat them but Jean Grey isn&#x27;t so keen. After some deliberation, the teams decide to split up with some staying on New Apocalypse and the other going to fight the creature through the portal. Sabretooth and Horror Show sacrifice themselves to provide a distraction whilst Kid Nightcrawler teleports a group of people through the portal. The remaining group in New Apocalypse heads off to formulate a plan of attack as the second monster tears through the city.

Northstar, Hercules, Howlett and Wolverine emerge in San Francisco of the 616 universe, where they find the monster draining the energy from the Dreaming Celestial&#x27;s chest. In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Jean and her group travel to the Apocalypse power. Fiend radios through from New Apocalypse, where one of the monsters is attacking. After a short conversation, the radio goes silent and Jean realizes her friend is dead. They make their way through some caverns to the room the Apocalypse power is being kept in. Dark Beast slips away as the others look at the canister the power resides in. Jean has Kurt teleport them both away as she doesn&#x27;t trust anyone else. In the 616 universe, Howlett and Wolverine try attacking the monster but it just continues attacking the Celestial. Northstar throws Hercules at it and the monster is finally ripped away from it. Wolverine and Howlett are severely injured, so Kid Nightcrawler starts to teleport them away as Hercules continues to fight the monster. The monster kills him before Kurt can get to him in time. The monster then advances on the Celestial again, which decides to leave. However, the monster uses a grappling hook to prevent it from doing so and, even though the rest of the team manages to separate the two, the monster begins to absorb the energy from the Celestial. The team can only watch as the monster kills the Dreaming Celestial and absorbs all of its energy, continuing to grow in size and power. In the AoA reality, Jean tells Kurt the plan is for her to use the Apocalypse power herself, as she managed to use the Phoenix Force and resist it. Before she can, though, Dark Beast snatches the canister off her just as one of the monsters finds them and attacks.

As Howlett mourns the death of Hercules, the monster in 616 becomes stronger, due to the Celestial it just destroyed. Northstar creates a vortex around it to stop it being empowered by more energy, whilst Prophet tries to figure out how to kill it. He finds out that billions more monsters are headed to where this one is and, if they don&#x27;t destroy this one, the whole world is doomed. In New Apocalypse on the other side of the portal, Jean is being chased by another monster. Dazzler and her team slow it down and Kurt teleports Prophet and Howlett through the portal. They see Dark Beast trying to take the power of the Apocalypse seed for himself. Nightcrawler and Jean try to take the seed off him but he fights back. Another monster enters and grabs the seed but is hurt by its touch. Dark Beast grabs the seed again and runs off with Jean and Nightcrawler chasing him. Prophet realizes that the monster was hurt by the seed. Kid Nightcrawler tells Dazzler her world is in danger too and Prophet says they have to close the portal and sacrifice one world. Dazzler refuses to do that and comes up with a plan. Whilst the others chase down Jean and the seed, Dazzler and Cyclops head to the portal. They use their powers to try and draw the monster through but it doesn&#x27;t go for it. Kid Nightcrawler finds them and decides he can do it. He teleports to the monster and then teleports it through the portal. The strain of doing it was too much for him, though, and he dies in Dazzler&#x27;s arms. Nightcrawler, Prophet, Howlett and Dark Beast teleport in. Dark Beast won&#x27;t let go of the seed, so Dazzler confronts him, beats him up and takes the seed. She then hands it over to Jean Grey, so they can have her use it on the three monsters at the same time.

Jean Grey has taken in the power of Apocalypse and has been transformed into an immensely powerful being. Though she still holds on to her personality, the death powers are already corrupting her. As the monsters feed off the energy from the portal, Jean engages them in combat, blasting them away and drawing their attention. Howlett mourns the death of Kid Nightcrawler, causing AoA Nightcrawler to face up to what he has done. Prophet tells him to stop pitying himself and says they need Sage and the Celestial black box from the other universe. Nightcrawler teleports through the portal and on his way he sees billions of other monsters descends upon the portal. In the 616 universe, Wolverine and Northstar are arguing about what to do. Sage manages to connect her mind to the black box and sees the origin of the monsters. The Celestials created life because they were lonely. They decided to create death as well, so they formed the monsters. However, the monsters turned against the Celestials who couldn&#x27;t kill them so they separated the universe into the Multiverse and bond them in the walls that separated all realities. The constant traveling between universes weakened the walls and allowed the monsters to escape again. Suddenly, Nightcrawler appears and take Sage back with him. In New Apocalypse, Jean is fighting the monsters but more continue to come through the portal. Slowly, the death seed starts to take her over more and she begins to lose herself. As the carnage spreads, Sage and Nightcrawler appear and Sage tells Prophet she knows what to do. He already knows, though. The monsters need a prison and this universe is the best choice. Dazzler tries to tell him there must be another way but he says there isn&#x27;t. They need to get everyone they can back to her world and then close off the portal. Nightcrawler says he can do both.
As Jean continues to fight the monsters in New Apocalypse, Prophet orders everyone to evacuate to the 616 reality. Dazzler objects to leaving, but Prophet tells her sacrificing the AoA reality is the only way. Nightcrawler begins to teleport everyone back, first taking Harper Simmons and then Sage. However, when he goes to take Iceman, the Dark Beast breaks free of his shackles and goes with them. He is quickly knocked out by Gambit on the other side, but not before jamming a nugget of the Apocalypse seed within Iceman to keep it safe. As Nightcrawler next takes Howlett and Cyclops, Dazzler begs Prophet to come with her but he refuses, saying a captain goes down with the ship. However, the decision is made for him when Jean Grey knocks him out and instructs Dazzler to take him back to her world. Jean goes off to continue her fight as Nightcrawler teleports Dazzler and Prophet away. In the 616 reality, Nightcrawler realizes that if he grabs onto the black swirls in the portal, he can teleport the opening back in on itself. Sage confirms he could close the portal and, before anyone can stop him, he goes. He manages to close it at the cost of his own life and separate the entirety of Earth-295 from the Multiverse. Afterwards, Howlett and Cyclops decide to travel to Greece to collect Hercules from the underworld. Wolverine offers Dazzler a job at the school but she declines, as she needs a bit of time to herself. A few weeks later, Harper meets Prophet on a beach, where they have a drink to remember their old team. Elsewhere, Dazzler creates a holographic image to make sure everyone remembers her fallen teammates.

==&quot;What If&quot;==
=== Synopsis for &quot;What If... The Age of Apocalypse Had Not Ended?&quot;===
An alternate AoA reality was presented when Magneto, giving up on Bishop&#x27;s mission in the final moments, rescued his family from the nuclear explosions alongside some of his allies. Magneto, Rogue, Sunfire, Quicksilver, and Weapon X found themselves working with the last remaining human heroes (including Tony Stark, Invisible Woman and Gwen Stacy, the latter of which formed a romance with Quicksilver) to deal with a new threat: the Coming of Galactus.
As there was no Fantastic Four, it fell to the survivors to work against Galactus and his herald, the Silver Surfer. As the heroes sprung into action, Night-Thrasher ended up using advanced technology to empower himself with amazing psychic powers. Together, they were able to do the impossible and claim victory. After Weapon X used his adamantium claws to slay the Silver Surfer, the collective psychic potential of humanity was focused against Galactus, eventually killing him.

<text>USS &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; (DD-958/DDG-8) was a &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; (DDG-8) was laid down 4 April 1958 by Defoe Shipbuilding Company, Bay City, Michigan; launched 28 July 1959; sponsored by Mrs. Lillian McCormick, wife of Admiral McCormick; and commissioned at Boston 3 June 1961.

&quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; departed Boston 23 August 1961 for her home port, San Diego, arriving 16 September. Early in 1962, she tested her missiles and antisubmarine weaponry in the Pacific missile range. Exercises and experiments continued in preparation for deployment to the western Pacific, for which she sailed 19 November 1962.

She arrived at Yokosuka on 6 December and within a week was on station with a 7th Fleet task group, taking up her part in the schedule of readiness training and exercises. Returning to San Diego 15 June 1963, she proceeded to Sacramento to help initiate its new deepwater port. All‑encompassing refresher training followed overhaul and modification at Hunters Point early in 1964, increasing her antiair warfare capabilities.

Vietnam War

A high state of readiness had been achieved when the Gulf of Tonkin incidents of 2 and 4 August escalated the Vietnam War.

In company with CruDesFlot 11, &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; departed 5 August for a 6-month deployment along the Vietnamese coast, primarily in the screen for &quot;Bon Homme Richard&quot; and other aircraft carriers. She returned to San Diego 6 February 1965. &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; spent the remainder of the year conducting coastal exercises, a successful competitive firing of her, missiles, and a summer cruise to Hawaii training midshipmen.

After anti-submarine exercises with the Royal Canadian Navy in January 1966, &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; prepared for a third tour of duty in WestPac.

She left San Diego on 1 March and 1-month later was shelling Vietcong bunkers and gun emplacements in the Mekong Delta. In May, she sailed up the eastern coast to support Yankee Station carrier operations against North Vietnam until August, when she sailed for her home port, arriving at San Diego 26 October. On 27 October, she entered drydock at Long Beach for a thorough overhaul. This was completed 23 March 1967.

Refresher training began on 15 May, and was interrupted on 27 May when she rushed to the aid of a stricken crewmember of the ship &quot;88 Pacific Comet&quot;. &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; continued operating out of San Diego until 17 August, at which time she departed for another WestPac deployment.

In October 1967 while shelling suspected North Vietnamese gun emplacements just north of the DMZ in company with the USS Newport News, &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; was taken under fire by North Vietnamese artillery. She and the Newport News departed the area while shells splashed around them. Film footage of the &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; was taken showing this event and was featured on Walter Cronkite&#x27;s Evening News. In January 1968, &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; was ordered to the coast off of Hue to provide gunfire support during the Tet offensive. She remained on station firing in support of American forces there for about two weeks until her barrels were completely spent.

In March 1968 she was ordered to the Sea of Japan as part of the USS Kearsarge battle group while a plan was considered about trying to retrieve the USS Pueblo (AGER-2), that was taken by the North Korean forces in international waters. April found the &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; headed back to San Diego completing her 67/68 deployment.

In June 1982, &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot; fired .50 caliber rounds over Vietnamese boats after the boats had fired on during an incident reminiscent of the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

=== 1983 Deployment ===
On 20 July 1983 the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot;, along with seven other vessels in the USS Ranger Battle Group, left San Diego on Friday, 15 July 1983 and were headed for the western Pacific when they were rerouted and ordered to steam for Central America to conduct training and flight operations in areas off the coasts of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras as part of major military exercises planned for that summer.

The battle group was composed of the carrier &quot;Ranger&quot;, battleship &quot;New Jersey&quot; (which joined the group in late August), cruiser &quot;Horne&quot;, the guided missile destroyer &quot;Lynde McCormick&quot;, the destroyers &quot;Fletcher&quot; and &quot;Fife&quot;, the frigate &quot;Marvin Shields&quot;, the oiler &quot;Wichita&quot; and the support ship &quot;Camden&quot;.

=== Operation Praying Mantis ===
In April 1988, the USS Lynde McCormick (DDG-8) was part of the largest combat action against another navy since WW-2. It was one of many ships of the U.S. fifth fleet under SAG Bravo engaged in operations against the Iranian Navy. This included anti – ship, and mine operations, stopping small – boat attacks against Persian Gulf shipping &amp; countering tactical operations by Iranian warships near the Strait of Hormuz. These operation was a resounding success and concluded in the freedom of navigation of commercial shipping in and out of the Persian Gulf.

=== Decommissioning ===
The ship was decommissioned 1 October 1991 and was sunk as a target ship on 14 February 2001.

<doc id="384537" wikidata="Q499197" url="?curid=384537" title="Handley Page Victor">
<text>The Handley Page Victor was a British jet-powered strategic bomber developed and produced by Handley Page during the Cold War. It was the third and final &quot;V bomber&quot; to be operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), the other two being the Vickers Valiant and the Avro Vulcan. Entering service in 1958, the Victor was initially developed as part of the United Kingdom&#x27;s airborne nuclear deterrent, but it was retired from the nuclear mission in 1968, following the discovery of fatigue cracks which had been exacerbated by the RAF&#x27;s adoption of a low-altitude flight profile to avoid interception, and due to the pending introduction of the Royal Navy&#x27;s submarine-launched Polaris missiles in 1969.

With the nuclear deterrent mission relinquished to the Royal Navy a large V-bomber fleet could not be justified. A number of Victors were modified for strategic reconnaissance, using a combination of radar, cameras, and other sensors. Prior to the introduction of Polaris, some had already been converted into tankers to replace Valiants; further conversions to tankers followed and some of these re-purposed Victors refuelled Vulcan bombers during the Black Buck raids of the Falklands War. The Victor was the last of the V-bombers to be retired from service on 15 October 1993. The Victor was replaced by Vickers VC10 and Lockheed Tristar tankers.

==Development==

===Origins===

The origin of the Victor and the other V bombers is linked to the early British atomic weapons programme and nuclear deterrent policies that were developed after the Second World War. The atom bomb programme formally began with Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.1001 issued in August 1946, which anticipated a government decision in January 1947 to authorise research and development work on atomic weapons; the U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) prohibited the export of atomic knowledge, even to countries that had collaborated on the Manhattan Project. OR.1001 envisaged a weapon not to exceed in length, in diameter, in weight, and suitable for release from to .

At the same time, the Air Ministry drew up requirements for bombers to replace the piston-engined heavy bombers such as the Avro Lancaster and the new Avro Lincoln which equipped RAF Bomber Command. In January 1947, the Ministry of Supply distributed Specification B.35/46 to aviation companies to satisfy Air Staff Operational Requirement OR.229 for &quot;a medium range bomber landplane capable of carrying one bomb to a target from a base which may be anywhere in the world&quot;. A cruising speed of at heights between and was specified. The maximum weight when fully loaded ought not to exceed . The weapons load was to include a &quot;Special gravity bomb&quot; (i.e. a free-fall nuclear weapon), or over shorter ranges of conventional bombs. No defensive weapons were to be carried, the aircraft relying on its speed and altitude to avoid opposing fighters.

The similar OR.230 required a &quot;long range bomber&quot; with a radius of action at a height of , a cruising speed of , and a maximum weight of when fully loaded. Responses to OR.230 were received from Short Brothers, Bristol, and Handley Page; the Air Ministry recognised that developing an aircraft to meet these stringent requirements would have been technically demanding and so expensive that the resulting bomber could be purchased only in small numbers. Realising that the majority of likely targets would not require such a long range, a less demanding specification for a medium-range bomber, Air Ministry Specification B.35/46 was issued. This demanded the ability to carry the same 10,000 lb bomb-load to a target away at a height of at a speed of .

===HP.80===
The design proposed by Handley Page in response to B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page&#x27;s aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80. Aviation author Bill Gunston described the Victor&#x27;s compound-sweep crescent wing as having been &quot;undoubtedly the most efficient high-subsonic wing on any drawing board in 1947&quot;. The sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant critical Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. The other parts of the aircraft which accelerate the flow, the nose and tail, were also designed for the same critical mach number so the shape of the HP.80 had a constant critical mach number all over. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured, a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.

The HP.80 and Avro&#x27;s Type 698 were chosen as the best two of the proposed designs to B.35/46, and orders for two prototypes of each were placed. It was recognised, however, that there were many unknowns associated with both designs, and an order was also placed for Vickers&#x27; design, which became the Valiant. Although not fully meeting the requirements of the specification, the Valiant design posed little risk of failure and could therefore reach service earlier. The HP.80&#x27;s crescent wing was tested on a ⅓-scale glider, the HP.87, and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker, which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation. The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence. By the time the HP.88 was ready, the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative. The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme.

Two HP.80 prototypes, &quot;WB771&quot; and &quot;WB775&quot;, were built. &quot;WB771&quot; had been partially assembled at the Handley Page factory at Radlett airfield when the Ministry of Supply decided the runway was too short for the first flight. The aircraft parts were transported by road to RAF Boscombe Down where they were assembled for the first flight; bulldozers were used to clear the route and create paths around obstacles. Sections of the aircraft were hidden under wooden framing and tarpaulins printed with &quot;GELEYPANDHY / SOUTHAMPTON&quot; to make it appear as a boat hull in transit. GELEYPANDHY was an anagram of &quot;Handley Pyge&quot;, marred by a signwriter&#x27;s error. On 24 December 1952, piloted by Handley Page&#x27;s chief test pilot Hedley Hazelden, &quot;WB771&quot; made its maiden flight, which lasted for a total of 17 minutes. Ten days later, the Air Ministry announced the aircraft&#x27;s official name to be &quot;Victor&quot;.

The prototypes performed well; however, design failings led to the loss of &quot;WB771&quot; on 14 July 1954, when the tailplane detached whilst making a low-level pass over the runway at Cranfield, causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew. Attached to the fin using three bolts, the tailplane was subjected to considerably more load than had been anticipated, causing fatigue cracking around the bolt holes. This led to the bolts loosening and failing in shear. Stress concentrations around the holes were reduced by adding a fourth bolt. The potential for flutter due to shortcomings in the design of the fin/tailplane joint was also reduced by shortening the fin. Additionally, the prototypes were tail heavy due to the lack of equipment in the nose; this was remedied by adding large ballast weights to the prototypes. Production Victors had a lengthened nose to move the crew escape door further from the engine intakes as the original position was considered too dangerous as an emergency exit in flight. The lengthened nose also improved the center of gravity range.

===Victor B.1===

Production &quot;B.1&quot; Victors were powered by the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 turbojets rated at , and were initially armed with the Blue Danube nuclear weapon and later with the more powerful Yellow Sun weapon when it became available. Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 nuclear bombs (made available under the Project E programme) and the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon. A total of 24 were upgraded to &quot;B.1A&quot; standard by the addition of Red Steer tail warning radar in an enlarged tail-cone and a suite of radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasures (ECM) from 1958 to 1960.

On 1 June 1956, a production Victor &quot;XA917&quot; flown by test pilot Johnny Allam inadvertently exceeded the speed of sound after Allam let the nose drop slightly at a high power setting. Allam noticed a cockpit indication of Mach 1.1 and ground observers from Watford to Banbury reported hearing a sonic boom. The Victor maintained stability throughout the event. Aviation author Andrew Brookes has claimed that Allam broke the sound barrier knowingly to demonstrate the Victor&#x27;s higher speed capability compared to the earlier V-bombers. The Victor was the largest aircraft to have broken the sound barrier at that time.

===Victor B.2===

The RAF required its bombers to be capable of higher operational ceilings, and numerous proposals were considered for improved Victors. Initially, Handley Page proposed using Sapphire 9 engines to produce a &quot;Phase 2&quot; bomber, to be followed by &quot;Phase 3&quot; Victors with the wingspan increased to and powered by Bristol Siddeley Olympus turbojets or Rolls-Royce Conway turbofans. The Sapphire 9 was cancelled and the heavily modified Phase 3 aircraft would have delayed introduction, so an interim &quot;Phase 2A&quot; Victor was proposed and accepted, to be powered by the Conway but with minimal modifications.

The &quot;Phase 2A&quot; proposal became the &quot; Victor B.2&quot;, with Conway RCo.11 engines providing , which required enlarged intakes to increase the airflow to the engines, and the wingspan was increased to . The B.2 also added a pair of retractable &quot;elephant ear&quot; intakes on the upper rear fuselage forward of the fin, to feed air to Ram Air Turbines (RAT) to provide electricity should an in-flight engine failure occur.

The first flight of the Victor B.2 prototype , serial number &quot;XH668&quot; was made on 20 February 1959, and it had flown 100 hours by 20 August 1959, when it disappeared from radar, crashing into the sea off the Pembrokeshire coast during high-altitude engine tests carried out by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE). Most of the wreckage had been recovered by November 1960, following an extensive search and recovery operation. The accident investigation concluded that the starboard pitot head had failed, causing the flight control system to force the aircraft into an unrecoverable dive. Minor changes resolved the problem, allowing the B.2 to enter service in February 1962.

===Further development===
A total of 21 B.2 aircraft were upgraded to the B.2R standard with Conway RCo.17 engines ( thrust) and facilities to carry a Blue Steel stand-off nuclear missile. Anti-radar chaff storage had to be relocated from under the nose as a result of the Blue Steel installation. Coincidentally, Peter White, a senior aerodynamicist attended a symposium in Brussels and learned of Whitcomb&#x27;s conical bodies set on the top of a wing which would add volume while reducing wave drag. However, the added skin friction drag meant an overall slight drag increase. So large streamlined fairings were added to the top of the each wing to hold the chaff. The fairings behaved like &quot;Küchemann carrots&quot;. These were anti-shock bodies which reduced wave drag at transonic speeds (see area rule). Handley Page proposed to build a further refined &quot;Phase 6&quot; Victor, with more fuel and capable of carrying up to four Skybolt (AGM-48) ballistic missiles on standing airborne patrols, but this proposal was rejected although it was agreed that some of the Victor B.2s on order would be fitted to carry two Skybolts. This plan was abandoned when the U.S. cancelled the Skybolt programme in 1963. With the move to low-level penetration missions, the Victors were fitted with air-to-air refuelling probes above the cockpit and received large underwing fuel tanks.

Nine B.2 aircraft were converted for strategic reconnaissance purposes to replace Valiants which had been withdrawn due to wing fatigue, with delivery beginning in July 1965. These aircraft received a variety of cameras, a bomb bay-mounted radar mapping system and air sampling equipment to detect particles released from nuclear testing. Designated Victor SR.2, a single aircraft could photograph the whole of the United Kingdom in a single two-hour sortie. Different camera configurations could be installed in the bomb bay, including up to four F49 survey cameras and up to eight F96 cameras could be fitted to take vertical or oblique daylight photography; nighttime photography required the fitting of F89 cameras.

===Aerial refuelling conversion===

Prior to the demise of the Valiant as a tanker, a trial installation of refuelling equipment was carried out using the Victor, including: overload bomb-bay tanks, underwing tanks, refuelling probe and jettisonable de Havilland Spectre Assisted Take-Off units. The aircraft involved in the trials, B.1 &quot;XA930&quot;, carried out successful trials at Boscombe Down at very high all-up weights with relatively short field length take-offs.

With the withdrawal of the Valiant because of metal fatigue in December 1964 the RAF had no flight-refuelling capability, so the B.1/1A aircraft, by then surplus in the strategic bomber role, were refitted for this duty. To get some tankers into service as quickly as possible, six B.1A aircraft were converted to &quot;B(K).1A&quot; standard (later redesignated &quot;B.1A (K2P)&quot;), receiving a two-point system with a hose and drogue carried under each wing, while the bomb bay remained available for weapons. Handley Page worked day and night to convert these six aircraft, with the first being delivered on 28 April 1965, and 55 Squadron becoming operational in the tanker role in August 1965.

While these six aircraft provided a limited tanker capability suitable for refuelling fighters, the Mk 20A wing hosereels delivered fuel at too low a rate to be suitable for refuelling bombers. Work therefore continued to produce a definitive three-point tanker conversion of the Victor Mk.1. Fourteen further B.1A and 11 B.1 were fitted with two permanently fitted fuel tanks in the bomb bay, and a high-capacity Mk 17 centreline hose dispenser unit with three times the fuel flow rate as the wing reels, and were designated &quot;K.1A&quot; and &quot;K.1&quot; respectively.

The remaining B.2 aircraft were not as suited to the low-level mission profile that the RAF had adopted for carrying out strategic bombing missions as the Vulcan with its stronger delta wing. This, combined with the switch of the nuclear deterrent from the RAF to the Royal Navy (with the Polaris missile) meant that the Victors were declared surplus to requirements. Hence, 24 B.2 were modified to &quot;K.2&quot; standard. Similar to the K.1/1A conversions, the wing, which was to have been fitted with tip fuel tanks to reduce wing fatigue, had 18 inches removed from each tip instead and the bomb aimer&#x27;s nose glazing was replaced with metal. During 1982, the glazing was reintroduced on some aircraft, the former nose bomb aimer&#x27;s position having been used to mount F95 cameras in order to perform reconnaissance missions during the Falklands War. The K.2 could carry of fuel. It served in the tanker role until withdrawn in October 1993.

==Design==
===Overview===

The Victor was a futuristic-looking, streamlined aircraft, with four turbojet (later turbofan) engines buried in the thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer&#x27;s position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes to act as an escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this requirement in 1950.

The Victor had a five-man crew, comprising the two pilots seated side by side and three rearward-facing crew, these being the navigator/plotter, the navigator/radar operator, and the air electronics officer (AEO). The Victor&#x27;s pilots sat at the same level as the rest of the crew, due to a large pressurised compartment that extended all the way to the nose. As with the other V-bombers, only the pilots were provided with ejection seats; the three systems operators relying on &quot;explosive cushions&quot; inflated by a CO2 bottle that would help them from their seats, but despite this, escape for them would have still been very unlikely in most emergency situations.

While assigned to the nuclear delivery role, the Victor was finished in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme, designed to protect the aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation. The white colour scheme was intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft; paler variations of RAF&#x27;s roundels were also applied for this same reason. When the V-bombers were assigned to the low-level approach profile in the 1960s, the Victors were soon repainted in green/grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft.

===Armaments and equipment===

The Victor&#x27;s bomb bay was much larger than that of the Valiant and Vulcan, which allowed heavier weapon loads to be carried at the cost of range. As an alternative to the single &quot;10,000 lb&quot; nuclear bomb as required by the specification, the bomb bay was designed to carry several conventional armaments, including a single Grand Slam or two Tallboy earthquake bombs, up to forty-eight bombs or thirty-nine sea mines. One proposed addition to the Victor were underwing panniers capable of carrying a further 28 1,000 lb bombs to supplement the main bomb bay, but this option was not pursued.

In addition to a range of free-fall nuclear bombs, later Victor B.2s operated as missile carriers for standoff nuclear missiles such as Blue Steel. Target information for Blue Steel could be input during flight, as well in advance of the mission. It was reported that, with intensive work, a B.2 missile carrier could revert to carrying free-fall nuclear weapons or conventional munitions within 30 hours.

Like the other two V-Bombers, the Victor made use of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been installed upon early aircraft. For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed several radar systems. These included the H2S radar, developed from the first airborne ground-scanning radar, and the Green Satin radar. Radar information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page&#x27;s preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, the accuracy of the bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.

===Avionics and systems===
The Victor had fully powered flying controls for the ailerons, elevators and rudder, with no manual reversion which required duplication as back-up. Since the control surfaces were fully powered an artificial feel unit was provided, fed by ram air from the pitot in the nose. Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system to the flying control units. Duplication was provided on the premise that the single pilot&#x27;s input would remain functional and that neither hydraulic motors nor screwjack on a unit would jam. A separate hydraulic circuit was used for each of the following: landing gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, wheel brakes, nose-wheel steering, ram-air-turbine air scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions to the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.

To evade enemy detection and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive ECM suite which were operated by the air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft&#x27;s electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar in the vicinity of the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.

Some of the ECM equipment which initially saw use on the Victor, such as the original chaff dispenser and Orange Putter tail warning radar, had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and was already considered to be nearly obsolete by the time the Victor entered service. Significant improvements and alterations were made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor&#x27;s role;. For example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications jamming equipment. Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.

===Engines===

The Victor B.1 was powered by four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines. The engines were embedded in pairs in the wing roots. Because of the mid wing position, the tail was mounted at the tip of the fin to keep clear of the jet efflux. Sapphire engines installed in the Victor suffered &#x27;centre-line closure&#x27; failures flying in dense cloud or heavy rain flying in the tropics. The Victor B.2 was powered by the newer Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan which at one point was the most powerful non-afterburning engine outside the Soviet Union. The Conway had significantly higher thrust than the Sapphire engine in the B.1.

The Victor B.2 had a Blackburn &quot;Artouste&quot; auxiliary power unit (AAPU) installed in the starboard wing root. It provided high-pressure air for starting the engines, and also provided electrical power on the ground or in the air as an emergency power supply if the engine-driven generators failed. It also reduced the need for some ground support equipment. Two turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air to them enabling them to generate sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would enable the crew to keep control of the aircraft until the engines could be relit.

===Flight profile===
The Victor was commonly described as having good handling and excellent performance, along with favourable low speed flight characteristics. During the flight tests of the first prototype, the Victor proved its aerodynamic performance, flying up to Mach 0.98 without handling or buffeting problems; there were next to no aerodynamic changes between prototype and production aircraft. Production aircraft featured an automated nose-flap operation to counteract a tendency for the aircraft to pitch upwards during low-to-moderate Mach numbers. At low altitude, the Victor typically flew in a smooth and comfortable manner, in part due to its narrowness and flexibility of the crescent wing. One unusual flight characteristic of the early Victor was its self-landing capability; once lined up with the runway, the aircraft would naturally flare as the wing entered into ground effect while the tail continued to sink, giving a cushioned landing without any command or intervention by the pilot. However, this characteristic was considered to be of no special advantage according to an assessment of the second prototype by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment.

The Victor has been described as an agile aircraft, atypical for a large bomber aircraft; in 1958, a Victor had performed several loops and a barrel roll during practices for a display flight at Farnborough Airshow. Manoeuvrability was greatly enabled by the light controls, quick response of the aircraft, and the design of certain flight surfaces such as the infinitely-variable tail-mounted airbrake. The Victor was designed for flight at high subsonic speeds, although multiple instances have occurred in which the sound barrier was broken. During development of the Victor B.2, the RAF had stressed the concept of tactical manoeuvrability, which led to much effort in development being given to increasing the aircraft&#x27;s height and range performance.

==Operational history==
The Victor was the last of the V bombers to enter service, with deliveries of B.1s to No. 232 Operational Conversion Unit RAF based at RAF Gaydon, Warwickshire taking place in late 1957. The first operational bomber squadron, 10 Squadron, formed at RAF Cottesmore in April 1958, with a second squadron, 15 Squadron, forming before the end of the year. Four Victors, fitted with Yellow Astor reconnaissance radar, together with passive sensors, were used to equip a secretive unit, the Radar Reconnaissance Flight at RAF Wyton. The Victor bomber force continued to build up, with 57 Squadron forming in March 1959 and 55 Squadron in October 1960. At its height, the Victor was simultaneously operating with six squadrons of RAF Bomber Command.

According to the operational doctrine developed by the RAF, in the circumstance of deploying a large-scale nuclear strike, each Victor would have operated entirely independently; the crews would conduct their mission without external guidance and be reliant upon the effectiveness of their individual tactics to reach and successfully attack their assigned target; thus great emphasis was placed on continuous crew training during peacetime. Developing a sense of a crew unity was considered highly important; Victor crews would typically serve together for at least five years, and a similar approach was adopted with ground personnel. In order to maximise the operational lifespan of each aircraft, Victor crews typically flew a single five-hour training mission per week. Each crew member was required to qualify for servicing certificates to independently undertake inspection, refuelling and turnaround operations.
In times of high international tension, the V-bombers would have dispersed and been maintained at a high state of readiness; if the order was given to deploy a nuclear strike, Victors at high readiness would have been airborne in under four minutes. British intelligence had estimated that the Soviets&#x27; radar network was capable of detecting the Victor at up to 200 miles away, so to avoid interception, the Victor would follow carefully planned routes to exploit weaknesses in the Soviet detection network. This tactic was employed in conjunction with the Victor&#x27;s extensive onboard ECM to increase the chances of evasion. Whilst originally the Victor would have maintained high-altitude flight throughout a nuclear strike mission, rapid advances of the Soviet anti-aircraft warfare capabilities (exemplified by the downing of a U-2 from 70,000 ft in 1960) led to this tactic being abandoned: a low-level high-speed approach supported by increasingly sophisticated ECMs was adopted in its place.

The improved Victor B.2 started to be delivered in 1961, with the first B.2 Squadron, 139 Squadron, forming in February 1962, and a second, 100 Squadron, in May 1962. These were the only two bomber squadrons to form on the B.2, as the last 28 Victors on order were cancelled. The prospect of Skybolt ballistic missiles, with which each V-bomber could strike at two separate targets, meant that fewer bombers would be needed. The government was also unhappy with Sir Frederick Handley Page&#x27;s resistance to its pressure to merge his company with competitors. Following Skybolt&#x27;s cancellation, Victor B.2s were retrofitted as carrier aircraft for the Blue Steel standoff nuclear missile. The introduction of standoff weapons and the switch to low-level flight in order to evade radar detection were said to be decisive factors in the successful penetration of enemy territory.
In 1964–1965, a series of detachments of Victor B.1As was deployed to RAF Tengah, Singapore as a deterrent against Indonesia during the Borneo conflict, the detachments fulfilling a strategic deterrent role as part of Far East Air Force, while also giving valuable training in low-level flight and visual bombing. In September 1964, with the confrontation with Indonesia reaching a peak, the detachment of four Victors was prepared for rapid dispersal, with two aircraft loaded with live conventional bombs and held on one-hour readiness, ready to fly operational sorties. However, they were never required to fly combat missions and the high readiness alert finished at the end of the month.

Following the discovery of fatigue cracks, developing due to their low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage by the end of 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet, and its existing fleet of Victor B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings, and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion proposal, with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life.
While the Victor was never permanently based with any units stationed overseas, temporary deployments were frequently conducted, often in a ceremonial capacity or to participate in training exercises and competitions. Victor squadrons were dispatched on several extended deployments to the Far East, and short term deployments to Canada were also conducted for training purposes. At one point during the early 1960s, South Africa showed considerable interest in the acquisition of several bomber-configured Victors.

Several of the Victor B.2s had been converted for Strategic Reconnaissance missions following the retirement of the Valiant in this capacity. In service, this type was primarily used in surveillance of the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Seas, capable of surveying 400,000 square miles in an eight-hour mission; they were also used to sample the fallout from French nuclear tests conducted in the South Pacific. Originally reconnaissance Victors were equipped for visual reconnaissance; it was found to be cheaper to assign Canberra light bombers to this duty and the cameras were removed in 1970. Subsequently, radar-based reconnaissance was emphasised in the type&#x27;s role. The reconnaissance Victors remained in use until 1974 when they followed the standard bombers into the tanker conversion line; a handful of modified Avro Vulcans assumed the maritime radar reconnaissance role in their place.

Both the Victor and the Vulcan, played a high-profile role during the 1982 Falklands War. In order to cross the distance of the South Atlantic, a single Vulcan required refuelling several times from Victor tankers. A total of three bombing missions were flown against Argentine forces deployed to the Falklands, with approximately 1.1 million gal (5 million L) of fuel consumed in each mission. At the time, these missions held the record for the world&#x27;s longest-distance bombing raids. The deployment of other assets to the theatre, such as the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod and Lockheed Hercules, required the support of the Victor tanker fleet, which had been temporarily relocated to RAF Ascension Island for the campaign. The Victor also undertook several reconnaissance missions over the South Atlantic. These missions provided valuable intelligence for the retaking of South Georgia by British forces.
Following the invasion of Kuwait by neighbouring Iraq in 1991, a total of eight Victor K.2s were deployed to Bahrain to provide in-flight refuelling support to RAF and other coalition aircraft during the subsequent 1991 Gulf War. RAF strike aircraft such as the Panavia Tornado would frequently make use of the tanker to refuel prior to launching cross-border strikes inside Iraq. The remaining Victor fleet was retired in 1993, at which point it had been the last of the three V-bombers in operational service.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 14 July 1954: &quot;WB771&quot; the prototype HP.80 crashed during a test flight at Cranfield, England. All four crewmen died. The tailplane detached from the top of the fin.
* 16 April 1958: &quot;XA921&quot; a B.1 undertaking Ministry of Supply trials experienced a collapse of the rear bomb bay bulkhead while cycling the bomb bay doors, damaging hydraulic and electrical systems; the aircraft successfully returned to base. Following the incident, in-service Victors had restrictions put in place on the opening of the bomb doors until Modification 943 was applied to all aircraft.
* 20 August 1959: &quot;XH668&quot; a B2 of the A&amp;AEE lost a pitot head and dived into the sea off Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire. More than 40 ships and 4,000 people were involved in the recovery of 600,000 pieces of the missing bomber, an exercise referred to as &#x27;Operation Victor Search&#x27;.
* 19 June 1960: &quot;XH617&quot; a B1A of 57 Squadron caught fire in the air and was abandoned near Diss, Norfolk.
* 23 March 1962: &quot;XL159&quot; a B2 of the A&amp;AEE stalled and dived into a house at Stubton, Lincolnshire.
* 14 June 1962: &quot;XH613&quot; a B1A of 15 Squadron lost power on all engines and was abandoned on approach to RAF Cottesmore.
* 16 June 1962: &quot;XA929&quot; a B1 of 10 Squadron overshot the runway and broke up at RAF Akrotiri following an aborted takeoff.
* 2 October 1962: &quot;XA934&quot; a B1 of &#x27;A&#x27; Squadron, 232 OCU had an engine failure and deliberate shutdown of the adjacent engine on takeoff from RAF Gaydon. During the approach to land the other two engines flamed out. The aircraft crashed into a copse several miles from RAF Gaydon. Of the four crew on board only the co-pilot survived. The RAF accident record states the prime cause as mis-management of the fuel system and consequent fuel starvation of the two running engines.
* 20 March 1963: &quot;XM714&quot; a B2 of 100 Squadron stalled after takeoff from RAF Wittering.
* 29 June 1966: &quot;XM716&quot; a SR2 of 543 Squadron was giving a demonstration flight for the press and television at RAF Wyton. The aircraft had made one high-speed circuit and was flying low in a wide arc to return over the airfield when the starboard wing was seen to break away and both it and the rest of the aircraft burst into flames. All four crew were killed. The aircraft was the first SR2 to enter service with the squadron. The aircraft had exceeded its operational limitations causing overstressing.
* 19 August 1968: Victor K1 &quot;XH646&quot; of 214 Squadron collided in midair near Holt, Norfolk in bad weather with a 213 Squadron English Electric Canberra &quot;WT325&quot;; all four crew members of the Victor died, as did all three on board the Canberra.
* 10 May 1973: &quot;XL230&quot; a SR2 of 543 Squadron bounced during landing at RAF Wyton and exploded.
* 24 March 1975: Victor K1A &quot;XH618&quot; of 57 Squadron was involved in a midair collision with Blackburn Buccaneer &quot;XV156&quot; during a simulated refuelling. The Buccaneer hit the Victor&#x27;s tailplane causing the Victor to crash into the sea 95 mi (153 km) east of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, four crew killed.
* 29 Sept 1976: &quot;XL513&quot; a K2 of No 55 Squadron aborted take off and overshot the runway at RAF Marham after a bird strike. The crew escaped with no serious injuries. The aircraft caught fire and was damaged beyond repair.
* 15 October 1982: &quot;XL232&quot; a K2 of No 55 Squadron suffered an uncontained turbine failure early in the take off run. The aircraft was stopped and the crew evacuated the aircraft with no injuries. Debris from the turbine penetrated a fuselage fuel tank, starting an uncontrolled fire, destroying the aircraft and damaging the runway at RAF Marham.
* 19 June 1986: &quot;XL191&quot; a K2 of 57 Squadron undershot approach at Hamilton, Ontario.
* 29 February 1988: Landing accident at USAF Offutt AB-hydraulic failure resulted in the aircraft running off the runway. As recorded and illustrated in Flypast October 2008 p. 107, this resulted in &#x27;I Ran Offut&#x27; artwork being applied to the crew door. Many of the USAF groundcrew at Offutt were Irish- American, so the tongue-in-cheek phrase is meant to be said in an Irish accent, &#x27;I ran off it&#x27;.
* 3 May 2009: During a &quot;fast taxi&quot; run at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, &quot;XM715&quot; (&quot;Teasin&#x27; Tina&quot;) made a brief unplanned flight, reaching a height of about at maximum, then carrying out a safe landing before the aircraft could reach the runway threshold. The aircraft did not have a permit to fly; however, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) stated that they would not be conducting an investigation. &quot;Teasin&#x27; Tina&quot; became airborne after the plane&#x27;s co-pilot had failed to reply to the command &quot;throttles back&quot;; the pilot then had to control the throttles himself, the confusion temporarily disrupting firm control of the aircraft.

==Surviving aircraft==

A total of four Victors have survived and are on display in the United Kingdom. None are flightworthy.
* Victor B.1A &quot;XH648&quot;: a B.1A (K.2P) at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, Cambridgeshire. This is the sole B.1 to survive. This aircraft is on display following a five year restoration project, which was formally completed in September 2022.
* Victor K.2 &quot;XH672&quot;: &quot;Maid Marian&quot;, at the Royal Air Force Museum, Cosford, Shropshire, in the National Cold War Exhibition.
* Victor K.2 &quot;XL231&quot;: &quot;Lusty Lindy&quot;, at the Yorkshire Air Museum, York. The prototype for the B.2 to K.2 conversion.
* Victor K.2 &quot;XM715&quot;: &quot;Teasin&#x27; Tina&quot;/&quot;Victor Meldrew&quot;, at the Cold War Jets Collection, Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome, Leicestershire. XM715, during a fast taxi demonstration, inadvertently left the ground briefly at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome in 2009.

A fifth airframe, Victor K.2 &quot;XH673&quot;: A K.2 served as Gate guardian at RAF Marham when retired in 1993, but in early 2020 she was offered up for disposal, with the word being that she was in a structurally unsafe condition. In spite of preservation attempts as of December 2020 most of the airframe had been scrapped. In February 2021, the RAF released the time-lapse footage of this airframe being dismantled.

<text>The DISER Lilith is a custom built workstation computer based on the Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 2901 bit slicing processor, created by a group led by Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zurich. The project began in 1977, and by 1984 several hundred workstations were in use. It has a high resolution full page portrait oriented cathode-ray tube display, a mouse, a laser printer interface, and a computer networking interface. Its software is written fully in Modula-2 and includes a relational database program named Lidas.

The Lilith processor architecture is a stack machine. Citing from Sven Erik Knudsen&#x27;s contribution to &quot;The Art of Simplicity&quot;: &quot;Lilith&#x27;s clock speed was around 7 MHz and enabled Lilith to execute between 1 and 2 million instructions (called M-code) per second. (...) Initially, the main memory was planned to have 65,536 16-bit words memory, but soon after its first version, it was enlarged to twice that capacity. For regular Modula-2 programs however, only the initial 65,536 words were usable for storage of variables.&quot;

==History==
The development of Lilith was influenced by the Xerox Alto from the Xerox PARC (1973) where Niklaus Wirth spent a sabbatical from 1976 to 1977. Unable to bring back one of the Alto systems to Europe, Wirth decided to build a new system from scratch between 1978 and 1980, selling it under the company name DISER (&quot;Data Image Sound Processor and Emitter Receiver System&quot;). In 1985, he had a second sabbatical leave to PARC, which led to the design of the Oberon System. Ceres, the follow-up to Lilith, was released in 1987.

==Operating system==

The Lilith operating system (OS), named Medos-2, was developed at ETH Zurich, by Svend Erik Knudsen with advice from Wirth. It is a single user, object-oriented operating system built from modules of Modula-2.

Its design influenced the design of the OS &quot;Excelsior&quot;, developed for the Soviet Kronos workstation (see below), by the Kronos Research Group (KRG).

==Soviet variants==
From 1986 into the early 1990s, Soviet Union technologists created and produced a line of printed circuit board systems, and workstations based on them, all named Kronos. The workstations were based on Lilith, and made in small numbers.

==Mouse==
The computer mouse of the Lilith was custom-designed, and later used with the Smaky computers. It then inspired the first mice produced by Logitech.

<text>Saraca asoca, commonly known as the ashoka tree (lit. &quot;sorrow-less&quot;), is a plant belonging to the Detarioideae subfamily of the Fabaceae family of plants (also referred to as the legume, pea, or bean family).

The tree is native to the Indian subcontinent, with its native range extending from Pakistan to the west, through India and Bangladesh to Myanmar in the east, and from Bhutan and Nepal in the north to Sri Lanka in the south. Within its native range, it is primarily growing in seasonally dry tropical forests.

It is an important tree to multiple cultural traditions across the Indian subcontinent and beyond.

The flower of ashoka tree is the state flower of Indian state of Odisha.

==Description==
The ashoka is a rain-forest tree. Its original distribution was in the central areas of the Deccan plateau, as well as the middle section of the Western Ghats in the western coastal zone of the Indian subcontinent.

The ashoka is prized for its beautiful foliage and fragrant flowers. It is a handsome, small, erect evergreen tree, with deep green leaves growing in dense clusters.

Its flowering season is around February to April. The ashoka flowers come in heavy, lush bunches. They are bright orange-yellow in color, turning red before wilting.

As a wild tree, the ashoka is a vulnerable species. It is becoming rarer in its natural habitat, but isolated wild ashoka trees are still to be found in the foothills of the central and eastern Himalayas, in scattered locations of the northern plains of India as well as on the west coast of the subcontinent near Mumbai.

There are a few varieties of the ashoka tree. One variety is larger and highly spreading. The columnar varieties are common in cultivation.

==Mythology and tradition==
The ashoka tree is used as a traditional medicinal plant.
It is considered sacred throughout the Indian subcontinent, especially in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka. This tree has many folklorical, religious and literary associations in the region. Highly valued as well for its handsome appearance and the color and abundance of its flowers, the ashoka tree is often found in royal palace compounds and gardens as well as close to temples throughout India. 

The ashoka tree is closely associated with the yakshi mythological beings. One of the recurring elements in Indian art, often found at gates of Buddhist and Hindu temples, is the sculpture of a yakshini with her foot on the trunk and her hands holding the branch of a flowering ashoka tree. As an artistic element, often the tree and the yakshi are subject to heavy stylization. Some authors hold that the young girl at the foot of this tree is based on an ancient tree deity related to fertility.
Yakshis under the ashoka tree were also important in early Buddhist monuments as a decorative element and are found in many ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. With the passing of the centuries the yakshi under the ashoka tree became a standard decorative element of Hindu Indian sculpture and was integrated into Indian temple architecture as salabhanjika, because there is often a confusion between the ashoka tree and the sal tree (&quot;Shorea robusta&quot;) in the ancient literature of the Indian subcontinent.

In Hinduism the ashoka is considered a sacred tree. Not counting a multitude of local traditions connected to it, the ashoka tree is worshipped in Chaitra, a month of the Hindu calendar. It is also associated with Kamadeva, the Hindu god of love, who included an ashoka blossom among the five flowers in his quiver, where ashoka represent seductive hypnosis. Hence, the ashoka tree is often mentioned in classical Indian religious and amorous poetry, having at least sixteen different names in Sanskrit referring to the tree or its flowers.

In &quot;Mahākāvya&quot;, or Indian epic poetry, the ashoka tree is mentioned in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; in reference to the &quot;Ashoka Vatika&quot; (garden of ashoka trees) where Hanuman first meets Sita.

==Other trees called &#x27;ashoka tree&#x27; ==

The ashoka tree is sometimes incorrectly known as &quot;Saraca indica&quot;. 

A popular tree known as &quot;false ashoka tree&quot; or even as &quot;ashoka tree&quot;, &quot;Polyalthia longifolia&quot;, is cultivated to resemble the growth pattern of erect pillar-like Mediterranean cypress trees. It is a popular park and garden plant, much used in landscaping on the Indian subcontinent, known also as &quot;Devadaar&quot; or &quot;Debdaru&quot;. This tree can easily be distinguished by its simple leaves and very different flowers. Ashoka flowers are red (initially orange in color) while &quot;P. longifolia&quot; flowers are apple green in color. Ashoka fruits look like broad beans containing multiple seeds while false ashoka fruits are small, spherical and contain only one seed. Ashoka trees are small in height, while false ashoka is taller.
