<text>John R. Rice (December 11, 1895 – December 29, 1980) was a Baptist evangelist and pastor and the founding editor of &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot;, an influential fundamentalist newspaper.

==Childhood and education==
John R. Rice was born in Cooke County, Texas, in 1895, the son of William H. and Sallie Elizabeth La Prade Rice, and the oldest of three brothers. Will Rice was a small businessman, a lay preacher, and a one-term state legislator &quot;well respected in the community.&quot; (Will Rice was also a Mason, an Odd Fellow, and &quot;an ardent Klansman&quot;—all of which memberships his son later believed were &quot;mistakes.&quot;) The death of John R. Rice&#x27;s mother when he was six years old left a lasting mark on the man.

At twelve Rice made a profession of faith and joined his parents&#x27; Southern Baptist Church. After being educated in public schools, he earned a teaching certificate and taught at a local primary school. In 1916 Rice entered Decatur Baptist College in Decatur, Texas, riding his cow pony 120 miles to get there and borrowing $60 on the horse to make his first tuition payment. In 1918, he was drafted into the Army, but after his discharge the following year, he attended Baylor University, from which he graduated in 1920. Rice was attending graduate school at the University of Chicago and volunteering at the Pacific Garden Mission when he was called to the full-time ministry and returned to Texas. He married Lloys McClure Cooke, whom he had met at Decatur, and shortly thereafter he entered Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.

==Early ministry==
Rice did not complete his seminary course but in 1923, took a position as the assistant pastor of a Southern Baptist church in Plainview, Texas. The following year he became senior pastor in Shamrock, Texas, an oil boomtown; but in 1926 he left the pastorate for evangelism. Settling in Fort Worth, he became an unofficial associate of J. Frank Norris, pastor of First Baptist Church, who was preparing to leave the Southern Baptist Convention. Rice himself broke with the Southern Baptists in 1927.

During the next few years, Rice held a series of successful revivals in Texas that were promoted by Norris. Rice made converts during his campaigns and then organized the new Christians into at least a half-dozen churches with the name &quot;Fundamentalist Baptist,&quot; a title that had come to be associated with Norris. In July 1932, Rice held an open-air evangelistic campaign in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas and hundreds made professions of faith. There Rice organized the Fundamentalist Baptist Tabernacle of Dallas; but instead of moving on, he pastored the church for more than seven years. The congregation of more than a thousand members built two buildings, the first being destroyed by fire. When Rice refused to bend to Norris&#x27;s will, the older man threatened him and then viciously attacked him in print. Nevertheless, Rice&#x27;s sermons continued to include much of his mentor&#x27;s sensationalism, with titles such as &quot;Wild Oats in Dallas--How Dallas People Sow Them and How They Are Reaped,&quot; &quot;The Dance--Child of the Brothel, Sister of Gambling and Drunkenness, Mother of Lust--Road to Hell!&quot; and &quot;Diseased, Decaying Bodies with Undying Maggots and Unquenched Fire in Hell&quot;

Rice believed that the mission of churches was &quot;not to take care of Christians&quot; but to &quot;win souls,&quot; a notion his mostly lower-middle-class church members did not wholeheartedly endorse. When Rice spent more time away from his pulpit to hold revivals elsewhere, a supply pastor and his supporters staged a coup. Rice decided to reenter evangelism. Yet before he did so, he encouraged the church to change its name from Fundamentalist Baptist Tabernacle to Galilean Baptist Church, thus distinguishing his ministry and that of the church from J. Frank Norris.

==Sword of the Lord==

In 1934, Rice founded The Sword of the Lord, a bi-weekly publication that grew into an influential fundamentalist Baptist newspaper. At first it was simply the publication of his Dallas church, handed out on the street and delivered door-to-door by Rice&#x27;s daughters and other Sunday School children.

When Rice re-entered full-time evangelism in 1940, he moved &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot; to Wheaton, Illinois, partially to educate his daughters at Wheaton College, and partially to put distance between himself and Norris. Rice had already begun to publish his sermons, and at his death, &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot; had printed more than 200 of his books and pamphlets, with more than 60 million copies in print. His sermon booklet, &quot;What Must I Do to Be Saved?&quot; was distributed in over 32 million copies in English, 8.5 million in Japanese, and nearly 2 million in Spanish. Perhaps his most popular books were &quot;Prayer--Asking and Receiving&quot; (1942) and &quot;The Home: Courtship, Marriage and Children&quot; (1945). Rice also wrote commentaries on books of the Bible, and he attacked humanism, worldliness (especially movies and dancing), evolution, fraternal lodges, and the Southern Baptist Convention.

A special target was religious liberalism. Rice recalled that while at the University of Chicago, he had heard a message by William Jennings Bryan and then observed a missionary&#x27;s son turn to infidelity during the subsequent campus discussion. &quot;It was a time of crisis in my life,&quot; recalled Rice. &quot;Standing there on the steps of Mandel Hall that spring afternoon with dusk coming on, I felt burning in me a holy fire. I lifted my hand solemnly to God and said, &#x27;If God gives me grace and I have opportunity to smite this awful unbelief that wrecks the faith of all it can, then smite it I will, so help me God!&#x27;&quot; Rice became a fierce opponent of the National Council of Churches, the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, and prominent liberal ministers, such as Harry Emerson Fosdick, Nels Ferré, and G. Bromley Oxnam.

&quot;The Sword&quot; circulation grew dramatically. It was thirty thousand in 1940, fifty thousand in 1946, and ninety thousand in 1953, surpassing the circulation of the venerable Moody Monthly. Rice regularly published reports from evangelistic campaigns that became valuable publicity tools for approved revivalists. In 1946, he and other prominent evangelists adopted a code of ethics and a statement of faith to prevent &quot;evangelists from being unduly criticized for commercialism and unethical practices.&quot; The same year Bob Jones College conferred on him an honorary Litt. D. degree.

==Evangelism conferences==

In 1945 Rice began organizing evangelism conferences, which in 1974 became Sword of the Lord Conferences. These meetings drew influential evangelists, such as Hyman Appelman, Joe Henry Hankins, Jack MacArthur, and especially Bob Jones Sr., whom Rice called &quot;the dean of all the evangelists.&quot; The conferences attracted large crowds of clergymen from various denominations, not just Baptists. For instance, the Fort Smith conference of August 1952 had an average attendance of six to eight hundred at the morning sessions and a thousand to two thousand in the evenings. So many fundamentalist churches began to accept Rice&#x27;s role as a clearing house for approved evangelists that to relieve some of the burden, he established a &quot;Sword Extension Department,&quot; headed by his brother Bill. The &quot;Sword of the Lord&quot; even placed babies born to unwed mothers.

==Separation from neo-evangelicals==

For a brief period during the late 1940s, Rice and &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot; held the allegiance of many orthodox Protestant Christians who would shortly be divided into Neo-Evangelical and Fundamentalist camps. While continuing to support older independent evangelists such as Bob Jones Sr. and Hyman Appelman, Rice now also endorsed the newer ministries of Youth for Christ, the Southern Baptist evangelist R. G. Lee, and especially, the young Billy Graham. By 1948, Rice believed Graham might become another Dwight L. Moody or Billy Sunday, and Graham&#x27;s evangelistic successes were regularly trumpeted in the pages of &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot;.

Meanwhile, Graham was distancing himself from fundamentalism. In 1954, Graham spoke to the faculty and student body of liberal Union Theological Seminary in New York, repeatedly referring to his ministry as &quot;ecumenical&quot;. Presbyterian fundamentalist Carl McIntire picked up on this &quot;compromising&quot; speech in his &quot;Christian Beacon&quot;, but Rice continued to defend Graham in &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot;. Graham used his considerable charm to remain in Rice&#x27;s good graces for as long as possible, even inviting the older man to participate in his 1955 Glasgow campaign. At 59, Rice had never been out of the United States, and his response to Graham&#x27;s red-carpet treatment in Scotland was more effusive praise.

Nevertheless, by 1956, the religious differences between Rice and Graham could no longer be papered over. Rice decided with some annoyance that Graham had been, at best, disingenuous about his relationship with religious liberals. Graham&#x27;s 1957 New York City campaign was held in cooperation with the Protestant Council of New York, which was &quot;predominantly nonevangelical and even included out-and-out modernists.&quot; Rice began to criticize Graham with increasing severity. When the seventy-five-year-old Bob Jones Sr. decided to draw the line of demarcation between fundamentalism and neo-evangelicalism, Rice agreed to chair the resolutions committee at a meeting of fundamentalist leaders in Chicago held on December 26, 1958. Ninety attendees signed a pledge, written by Rice&#x27;s committee, promising not to participate in evangelistic campaigns sponsored by clergymen who denied such cardinal doctrines of orthodox Christian belief as the inspiration of the Bible, the virgin birth, and the bodily resurrection of Christ. The names of Bob Jones Sr., Bob Jones Jr., and John R. Rice headed the list. Rice had clearly cast his lot with such separatist fundamentalists as Carl McIntire, Robert T. Ketcham, W. O. H. Garman, George Beauchamp Vick, Lee Roberson, Oliver B. Greene, and Archer Weniger, while the majority of Protestant evangelicals opted for a less militant position.

The break with Billy Graham left &quot;The Sword&quot; reeling. Circulation dropped from over 100,000 in 1956 to 67,000 in 1957. Rice was also refused the use of a conference center in Toccoa, Georgia, where he had held Sword rallies for thirteen years, because its founder, R. G. LeTourneau, had sided with neo-evangelicalism. Even more distressing to Rice was the break with radio preacher Charles E. Fuller, whose namesake seminary quickly moved to the vanguard of the neo-evangelical movement. Only a few years earlier, Fuller, Rice, and Jones had appeared together at a rally.

In 1963, Rice moved &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot; from Wheaton to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where his brother Bill had established the Bill Rice Ranch, a ministry to the deaf. The cost of living in Murfreesboro was also cheaper than in the Chicago area. But Rice primarily wished to cut his ties with Wheaton, which had become a center of the neo-evangelical movement that he opposed.

==Separation from separationists==

In 1959, Rice and Bob Jones Sr. held a series of one-day rallies in different parts of the country in an attempt to explain the separationist position to the wavering, and Jones urged that the &quot;Sword&quot; be made &quot;the official organ&quot; of separatist fundamentalism. Meanwhile, Rice made new, younger, friends. One was Jack Hyles, who in 1959 had become the pastor of First Baptist Church of Hammond, Indiana; another was Curtis Hutson, who eventually became Rice&#x27;s successor. A third was Jerry Falwell, pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Virginia.

In 1971, Rice planned a &quot;great world conference on evangelism&quot; that would bring together the various strands of fundamentalism. But Bob Jones Sr. had died three years earlier, and his son and successor, Bob Jones Jr., objected to the inclusion in the conference program of two Southern Baptists, W. A. Criswell and R. G. Lee, whom Jones considered &quot;compromisers and traitors to the cause of Scriptural evangelism.&quot; (It did not help that shortly before Jones Sr.&#x27;s death, Criswell had referred to him as &quot;a senile old fool.&quot;) Jones also opposed Rice&#x27;s insistence that there be no criticism of Billy Graham (and presumably, neo-evangelicalism) at the conference. Rice argued that his position on separation was the same as that held by Bob Jones Sr. and that there was &quot;nobody living in this world who was more intimately acquainted&quot; with the late evangelist. Not surprisingly, Jones Jr. disagreed, and he and Rice engaged in an exchange of views about separation—Rice in &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot;, Jones in a pamphlet, &quot;Facts John R. Rice Will Not Face.&quot; To Rice the importance of soulwinning trumped what he considered minor disagreements among Christians about biblical separation.

The upshot was that Rice&#x27;s planned conference was postponed and then canceled. In November 1971, Bob Jones Jr. and Bob Jones III were dropped from the cooperating board of &quot;The Sword&quot; to be replaced by Jerry Falwell and Curtis Hutson. In 1976, Jones, Ian Paisley, and Wayne Van Gelderen organized their own &quot;World Congress of Fundamentalists&quot; in Edinburgh. Unlike the split with Billy Graham, however, Rice&#x27;s refusal to agree with separationist fundamentalists like Bob Jones Jr. and Ian Paisley only enhanced the growth of &quot;The Sword&quot;. By the mid-1960s, the paper had more than recovered its losses after Rice&#x27;s criticism of Billy Graham; in 1974, circulation of &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot; was over 300,000. Rice had been a major participant in shaping the two most important divisions of late twentieth-century fundamentalism, the split between fundamentalists and neo-evangelicals and then the creation of two fundamentalist factions: Rice&#x27;s more sentimental and irenic; Jones&#x27;s more academic, doctrinal, and confrontational.

==Personality==

Rice was an exceptionally hard worker who rarely took vacations. He once estimated that he had been away from home for thirty years of his forty-five year ministry. His book &quot;Home, Courtship, Marriage and Children&quot; was written almost entirely on the road, one chapter dictated on a train between Chicago and Albany, most of another while waiting for a plane at LaGuardia. A daughter who took a semester out of college to play the piano for Rice in two large revivals was there also pressed into service taking his dictation and typing the manuscript of the final chapters of the book. He claimed that woodworking was his hobby, but although he had all the necessary tools, he never had the time to use them. A brick room behind his house intended for woodworking was eventually used for storage.

Rice was gracious with praise and commanded the loyalty of his staff. He had a sometimes corny sense of humor—such as asking service station attendants, &quot;Do you know where I could buy some gasoline?&quot; or walking by a table filled with his own books and remarking to potential buyers, &quot;I have read these books and find them to be sound.&quot; He liked dogs, horses, and children. Once he was discovered after a service playing hopscotch. He wrote texts and picked out melodic lines for dozens of simple gospel songs, mostly about revival and soulwinning. He was extremely frugal; there was never a hint of scandal about his personal life, and the testimonies of his six daughters were a credit to his ministry. Once on a car trip from Dallas to Chicago, Rice prayed, &quot;Lord, help me to find someone I can win.&quot; He then missed a turn in Oklahoma and drove fifty miles out of the way. At a gas station where he stopped to ask directions, he led the attendant to Christ. Still upset about the unplanned detour, his daughters giggled at him, reminding him of his earlier prayer.

At 81, with a hearing aid, suffering from arthritis, and aware that his memory was &quot;not quick as it was years ago,&quot; Rice still managed to be at the office most mornings at 6:30. In 1978, he had a heart attack, then a second, more serious one in April 1980. He died of a stroke on December 29. The staff counted 22,923 letters that had come to Rice between the beginning of his writing ministry and his death, each reporting that the writer had found Christ through Rice&#x27;s books or booklets or through a sermon published in &quot;The Sword of the Lord&quot;.

<text>William Jerdan FSA (16 April 1782 – 11 July 1869), Scottish journalist, was born at Kelso, Scotland.

During the years between 1799 and 1806, he spent short periods in a country lawyer&#x27;s office, a London West India merchant&#x27;s counting house, an Edinburgh solicitor&#x27;s chambers, and held the position of surgeon&#x27;s mate on board H.M. guardship &quot;Gladiator&quot; in Portsmouth Harbour, under his uncle, who was surgeon.

He went to London in 1806 and became a newspaper reporter. He was in the lobby of the House of Commons on 11 May 1812, when Spencer Perceval was shot, and was the first to seize the assassin. By 1812, he had become editor of &quot;The Sun&quot;, a semi-official Tory paper started by John Heriot in 1792; he was still there in 1815 and occasionally inserted literary articles, then quite an unusual proceeding; but a quarrel with the chief proprietor brought that engagement to a close in 1817. He passed next to the editor&#x27;s chair of &quot;The Literary Gazette&quot;, which he conducted with success for thirty-four years.

Jerdan&#x27;s position as editor brought him into contact with many distinguished writers. An account of his friends, among whom Canning was a special intimate, is to be found in his &quot;Men I have Known&quot; (1866); the men featured in the book include William Buckland, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Edward Forbes, F.R.S. (with a colourful, eyewitness account of one of Forbes&#x27; early oceanographic dredging operations) and William Wordsworth. When Jerdan retired in 1850 from the editorship of &quot;The Literary Gazette&quot;, his pecuniary affairs were far from satisfactory. A testimonial of over £900 was subscribed by his friends; and in 1853 a government pension of 100 guineas was conferred on him by Lord Aberdeen. He published his &quot;Autobiography&quot; in four volumes from 1852 to 1853.

His grave in Bushey has a memorial sculpted by Joseph Durham.

<text>Lexicostatistics is a method of comparative linguistics that involves comparing the percentage of lexical cognates between languages to determine their relationship. Lexicostatistics is related to the comparative method but does not reconstruct a proto-language. It is to be distinguished from glottochronology, which attempts to use lexicostatistical methods to estimate the length of time since two or more languages diverged from a common earlier proto-language. This is merely one application of lexicostatistics, however; other applications of it may not share the assumption of a constant rate of change for basic lexical items.

The term &quot;lexicostatistics&quot; is misleading in that mathematical equations are used but not statistics. Other features of a language may be used other than the lexicon, though this is unusual. Whereas the comparative method used shared identified innovations to determine sub-groups, lexicostatistics does not identify these. Lexicostatistics is a distance-based method, whereas the comparative method considers language characters directly. The lexicostatistics method is a simple and fast technique relative to the comparative method but has limitations (discussed below). It can be validated by cross-checking the trees produced by both methods.

==History==
Lexicostatistics was developed by Morris Swadesh in a series of articles in the 1950s, based on earlier ideas. The concept&#x27;s first known use was by Dumont d&#x27;Urville in 1834 who compared various &quot;Oceanic&quot; languages and proposed a method for calculating a coefficient of relationship. Hymes (1960) and Embleton (1986) both review the history of lexicostatistics.

==Method==

===Create word list===
The aim is to generate a list of universally used meanings (hand, mouth, sky, I). Words are then collected for these meaning slots for each language being considered. Swadesh reduced a larger set of meanings down to 200 originally. He later found that it was necessary to reduce it further but that he could include some meanings that were not in his original list, giving his later 100-item list. The Swadesh list in Wiktionary gives the total 207 meanings in a number of languages. Alternative lists that apply more rigorous criteria have been generated, e.g. the Dolgopolsky list and the Leipzig–Jakarta list, as well as lists with a more specific scope; for example, Dyen, Kruskal and Black have 200 meanings for 84 Indo-European languages in digital form.

===Determine cognacies===
A trained and experienced linguist is needed to make cognacy decisions. However, the decisions may need to be refined as the state of knowledge increases. However, lexicostatistics does not rely on all the decisions being correct. For each pair of words (in different languages) in this list, the cognacy of a form could be positive, negative or indeterminate. Sometimes a language has multiple words for one meaning, e.g. &quot;small&quot; and &quot;little&quot; for &quot;not big&quot;.

===Calculate lexicostatistic percentages===
This percentage is related to the proportion of meanings for a particular language pair that are cognate, i.e. relative to the total without indeterminacy. This value is entered into an table of distances, where N is the number of languages being compared. When completed, this table is half-filled in triangular form. The higher the proportion of cognacy the closer the languages are related.

===Create family tree===
Creation of the language tree is based solely on the table found above. Various sub-grouping methods can be used but that adopted by Dyen, Kruskal and Black was:
* all lists are placed in a pool
* the two closest members are removed and form a nucleus which is placed in the pool
* this step is repeated
* under certain conditions a nucleus becomes a group
* this is repeated until the pool only contains one group.

Calculations have to be of nucleus and group lexical percentages.

==Applications==
A leading exponent of lexicostatistics application has been Isidore Dyen. He used lexicostatistics to classify Austronesian languages as well as Indo-European ones. A major study of the latter was reported by Dyen, Kruskal and Black (1992). Studies have also been carried out on Amerindian and African languages.

===Pama-Nyungan===
The problem of internal branching within the Pama-Nyungan language family has been a long-standing issue for Australianist linguistics, and general consensus held that internal connections between the 25+ different subgroups of Pama-Nyungan were either impossible to reconstruct or that the subgroups were not in fact genetically related at all. In 2012, Claire Bowern and Quentin Atkinson published the results from their application of computational phylogenetic methods on 194 doculects representing all major subgroups and isolates of Pama-Nyungan. Their model &quot;recovered&quot; many of the branches and divisions that had erstwhile been proposed and accepted by many other Australianists, while also providing some insight into the more problematic branches, such as Paman (which is complicated by the lack of data) and Ngumpin-Yapa (where the genetic picture is obscured by very high rates of borrowing between languages). Their dataset forms the largest of its kind for a hunter-gatherer language family, and the second largest overall after Austronesian (Greenhill et al. 2008 ). They conclude that Pama-Nyungan languages are in fact not exceptional to lexicostatistical methods, which have successfully been applied to other language families of the world.

==Criticisms==
People such as Hoijer (1956) have shown that there were difficulties in finding equivalents to the meaning items while many have found it necessary to modify Swadesh&#x27;s lists. Gudschinsky (1956) questioned whether it was possible to obtain a universal list.

Factors such as borrowing, tradition and taboo can skew the results, as with other methods. Sometimes lexicostatistics has been used with lexical similarity being used rather than cognacy to find resemblances. This is then equivalent to mass comparison.

The choice of meaning slots is subjective, as is the choice of synonyms.

==Improved methods==
Some of the modern computational statistical hypothesis testing methods can be regarded as improvements of lexicostatistics in that they use similar word lists and distance measures.

<doc id="382251" wikidata="Q269323" url="?curid=382251" title="Natural philosophy">
<text>Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin &quot;philosophia naturalis&quot;) is the philosophical study of physics, that is, nature and the physical universe while ignoring any supernatural influence. It was dominant before the development of modern science.

From the ancient world (at least since Aristotle) until the 19th century, natural philosophy was the common term for the study of physics (nature), a broad term that included botany, zoology, anthropology, and chemistry as well as what we now call physics. It was in the 19th century that the concept of science received its modern shape, with different subjects within science emerging, such as astronomy, biology, and physics. Institutions and communities devoted to science were founded. Isaac Newton&#x27;s book &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687) (English: &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;) reflects the use of the term &quot;natural philosophy&quot; in the 17th century. Even in the 19th century, the work that helped define much of modern physics bore the title &quot;Treatise on Natural Philosophy&quot; (1867).

In the German tradition, &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; (philosophy of nature) persisted into the 18th and 19th centuries as an attempt to achieve a speculative unity of nature and spirit, after rejecting the tradition and replacing Aristotelian metaphysics, along with those of the dogmatic churchmen, with Kantian rationalism. Some of the greatest names in German philosophy are associated with this movement, including Goethe, Hegel, and Schelling. &quot;Naturphilosophie&quot; was associated with Romanticism and a view that regarded the natural world as a kind of giant organism, as opposed to the philosophical approach of figures such as John Locke and others espousing a more mechanical philosophy of the world, regarding it as being like a machine.

==Origin and evolution of the term==
The term &quot;natural philosophy&quot; preceded current usage of &quot;natural science&quot; (i.e. empirical science). Empirical science historically developed out of philosophy or, more specifically, natural philosophy. Natural philosophy was distinguished from the other precursor of modern science, natural history, in that natural philosophy involved reasoning and explanations about nature (and after Galileo, quantitative reasoning), whereas natural history was essentially qualitative and descriptive.

Greek philosophers defined natural philosophy as the combination of beings living in the universe, ignoring things made by humans. The other definition refers to human nature.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, natural philosophy was one of many branches of philosophy, but was not a specialized field of study. The first person appointed as a specialist in Natural Philosophy &quot;per se&quot; was Jacopo Zabarella, at the University of Padua in 1577.

Modern meanings of the terms &quot;science&quot; and &quot;scientists&quot; date only to the 19th century. Before that, &quot;science&quot; was a synonym for &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;study&quot;, in keeping with its Latin origin. The term gained its modern meaning when experimental science and the scientific method became a specialized branch of study apart from natural philosophy, especially since William Whewell, a natural philosopher from the University of Cambridge, proposed the term &quot;scientist&quot; in 1834 to replace such terms as &quot;cultivators of science&quot; and &quot;natural philosopher&quot;.

From the mid-19th century, when it became increasingly unusual for scientists to contribute to both physics and chemistry, &quot;natural philosophy&quot; came to mean just &quot;physics&quot;, and the word is still used in that sense in degree titles at the University of Oxford and University of Aberdeen. In general, chairs of Natural Philosophy established long ago at the oldest universities are nowadays occupied mainly by physics professors. Isaac Newton&#x27;s book &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687), whose title translates to &quot;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&quot;, reflects the then-current use of the words &quot;natural philosophy&quot;, akin to &quot;systematic study of nature&quot;. Even in the 19th century, a treatise by Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled &quot;Treatise on Natural Philosophy&quot; (1867).

==Scope==
Plato&#x27;s earliest known dialogue, &quot;Charmides,&quot; distinguishes between &quot;science&quot; or bodies of knowledge that produce a physical result, and those that do not. Natural philosophy has been categorized as a theoretical rather than a practical branch of philosophy (like ethics). Sciences that guide arts and draw on the philosophical knowledge of nature may produce practical results, but these subsidiary sciences (e.g., architecture or medicine) go beyond natural philosophy.

The study of natural philosophy seeks to explore the cosmos by any means necessary to understand the universe. Some ideas presuppose that change is a reality. Although this may seem obvious, there have been some philosophers who have denied the concept of metamorphosis, such as Plato&#x27;s predecessor Parmenides and later Greek philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and perhaps some Eastern philosophers. George Santayana, in his &quot;Scepticism and Animal Faith,&quot; attempted to show that the reality of change cannot be proven. If his reasoning is sound, it follows that to be a physicist, one must restrain one&#x27;s skepticism enough to trust one&#x27;s senses, or else rely on anti-realism.

René Descartes&#x27; metaphysical system of mind–body dualism describes two kinds of substance: matter and mind. According to this system, everything that is &quot;matter&quot; is deterministic and natural—and so belongs to natural philosophy—and everything that is &quot;mind&quot; is volitional and non-natural, and falls outside the domain of philosophy of nature.

==Branches and subject matter==
Major branches of natural philosophy include astronomy and cosmology, the study of nature on the grand scale; etiology, the study of (intrinsic and sometimes extrinsic) causes; the study of chance, probability and randomness; the study of elements; the study of the infinite and the unlimited (virtual or actual); the study of matter; mechanics, the study of translation of motion and change; the study of nature or the various sources of actions; the study of natural qualities; the study of physical quantities; the study of relations between physical entities; and the philosophy of space and time. (Adler, 1993)

== History ==
Humankind&#x27;s mental engagement with nature certainly predates civilization and the record of history. Philosophical, and specifically non-religious thought about the natural world, goes back to ancient Greece. These lines of thought began before Socrates, who turned from his philosophical studies from speculations about nature to a consideration of man, or in other words, political philosophy. The thought of early philosophers such as Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Democritus centered on the natural world. In addition, three Presocratic philosophers who lived in the Ionian town of Miletus (hence the Milesian School of philosophy), Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, attempted to explain natural phenomena without recourse to creation myths involving the Greek gods. They were called the &quot;physikoi&quot; (&quot;natural philosophers&quot;) or, as Aristotle referred to them, the &quot;physiologoi&quot;. Plato followed Socrates in concentrating on man. It was Plato&#x27;s student, Aristotle, who, in basing his thought on the natural world, returned empiricism to its primary place, while leaving room in the world for man. Martin Heidegger observes that Aristotle was the originator of conception of nature that prevailed in the Middle Ages into the modern era:

Aristotle surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.

&quot;The world we inhabit is an orderly one, in which things generally behave in predictable ways, Aristotle argued, because every natural object has a &quot;nature&quot;—an attribute (associated primarily with form) that makes the object behave in its customary fashion...&quot; Aristotle recommended four causes as appropriate for the business of the natural philosopher, or physicist, &quot;and if he refers his problems back to all of them, he will assign the &#x27;why&#x27; in the way proper to his science—the matter, the form, the mover, [and] &#x27;that for the sake of which. While the vagaries of the material cause are subject to circumstance, the formal, efficient and final cause often coincide because in natural kinds, the mature form and final cause are one and the same. The capacity to mature into a specimen of one&#x27;s kind is directly acquired from &quot;the primary source of motion&quot;, i.e., from one&#x27;s father, whose seed (&quot;sperma&quot;) conveys the essential nature (common to the species), as a hypothetical &quot;ratio&quot;.

; Material cause : An object&#x27;s motion will behave in different ways depending on the [substance/essence] from which it is made. (Compare clay, steel, etc.)
; Formal cause : An object&#x27;s motion will behave in different ways depending on its material arrangement. (Compare a clay sphere, clay block, etc.)
; Efficient cause : That which caused the object to come into being; an &quot;agent of change&quot; or an &quot;agent of movement&quot;. 
; Final cause : The reason that caused the object to be brought into existence. 

From the late Middle Ages into the modern era, the tendency has been to narrow &quot;science&quot; to the consideration of efficient or agency-based causes of a particular kind:

===In ancient Greece===
Early Greek philosophers studied motion and the cosmos. Figures like Hesiod regarded the natural world as offspring of the gods, whereas others like Leucippus and Democritus regarded the world as lifeless atoms in a vortex. Anaximander deduced that eclipses happen because of apertures in rings of celestial fire. Heraclitus believed that the heavenly bodies were made of fire that were contained within bowls. He thought that eclipses happen when the bowl turned away from the earth. Anaximenes is believed to have stated that an underlying element was air, and by manipulating air someone could change its thickness to create fire, water, dirt, and stones. Empedocles identified the elements that make up the world, which he termed the roots of all things, as fire, air, earth, and water. Parmenides argued that all change is a logical impossibility. He gives the example that nothing can go from nonexistence to existence. Plato argues that the world is an imperfect replica of an idea that a divine craftsman once held. He also believed that the only way to truly know something was through reason and logic. Not the study of the object itself, but that changeable matter is a viable course of study.

===Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy of nature===

:::&quot;An acorn is potentially, but not actually, an oak tree. In becoming an oak tree, it becomes actually what it originally was only potentially. This change thus involves passage from potentiality to actuality — not from non-being to being but from one kind or degree to being another&quot;

Aristotle held many important beliefs that started a convergence of thought for natural philosophy. Aristotle believed that attributes of objects belong to the objects themselves, and share traits with other objects that fit them into a category. He uses the example of dogs to press this point. An individual dog may have very specific attributes (ex. one dog can be black and another brown) but also very general ones that classify it as a dog (ex. four-legged). This philosophy can be applied to many other objects as well. This idea is different from that of Plato, with whom Aristotle had a direct association. Aristotle argued that objects have properties &quot;form&quot; and something that is not part of its properties &quot;matter&quot; that defines the object. The form cannot be separated from the matter. Given the example that you can not separate properties and matter since this is impossible, you cannot collect properties in a pile and matter in another.

Aristotle believed that change was a natural occurrence. He used his philosophy of form and matter to argue that when something changes you change its properties without changing its matter. This change occurs by replacing certain properties with other properties. Since this change is always an intentional alteration whether by forced means or by natural ones, change is a controllable order of qualities. He argues that this happens through three categories of being: non-being, potential being, and actual being. Through these three states the process of changing an object never truly destroys an object&#x27;s forms during this transition state but rather just blurs the reality between the two states. An example of this could be changing an object from red to blue with a transitional purple phase.

===Medieval philosophy of motion===
Medieval thoughts on motion involved much of Aristotle&#x27;s works &quot;Physics&quot; and &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. The issue that medieval philosophers had with motion was the inconsistency found between book 3 of &quot;Physics&quot; and book 5 of &quot;Metaphysics&quot;. Aristotle claimed in book 3 of &quot;Physics&quot; that motion can be categorized by substance, quantity, quality, and place. where in book 5 of &quot;Metaphysics&quot; he stated that motion is a magnitude of quantity. This disputation led to some important questions to natural philosophers: Which category/categories does motion fit into? Is motion the same thing as a terminus? Is motion separate from real things? These questions asked by medieval philosophers tried to classify motion.

William of Ockham gives a good concept of motion for many people in the Middle Ages. There is an issue with the vocabulary behind motion that makes people think that there is a correlation between nouns and the qualities that make nouns. Ockham states that this distinction is what will allow people to understand motion, that motion is a property of mobiles, locations, and forms and that is all that is required to define what motion is. A famous example of this is Occam&#x27;s razor, which simplifies vague statements by cutting them into more descriptive examples. &quot;Every motion derives from an agent.&quot; becomes &quot;each thing that is moved, is moved by an agent&quot; this makes motion a more personal quality referring to individual objects that are moved.

===Natural philosophy in the early modern period===

The scientific method has ancient precedents, and Galileo exemplifies a mathematical understanding of nature, which is a hallmark of modern natural scientists. Galileo proposed that objects falling regardless of their mass would fall at the same rate, as long as the medium they fall in is identical. The 19th-century distinction of a scientific enterprise apart from traditional natural philosophy has its roots in prior centuries. Proposals for a more &quot;inquisitive&quot; and practical approach to the study of nature are notable in Francis Bacon, whose ardent convictions did much to popularize his insightful Baconian method. The Baconian method is employed throughout Thomas Browne&#x27;s encyclopaedia &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot; (1646–1672), which debunks a wide range of common fallacies through empirical investigation of nature. The late-17th-century natural philosopher Robert Boyle wrote a seminal work on the distinction between physics and metaphysics called, &quot;A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature&quot;, as well as &quot;The Skeptical Chymist&quot;, after which the modern science of chemistry is named, (as distinct from proto-scientific studies of alchemy). These works of natural philosophy are representative of a departure from the medieval scholasticism taught in European universities, and anticipate in many ways, the developments that would lead to science as practiced in the modern sense. As Bacon would say, &quot;vexing nature&quot; to reveal &quot;her&quot; secrets (scientific experimentation), rather than a mere reliance on largely historical, even anecdotal, observations of empirical phenomena, would come to be regarded as a defining characteristic of modern science, if not the very key to its success. Boyle&#x27;s biographers, in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry, neglect how steadily he clung to the scholastic sciences in theory, practice and doctrine. However, he meticulously recorded observational detail on practical research, and subsequently advocated not only this practice, but its publication, both for successful and unsuccessful experiments, so as to validate individual claims by replication.

Natural philosophers of the late 17th or early 18th century were sometimes insultingly described as &#x27;projectors&#x27;. A projector was an entrepreneur who invited people to invest in his invention but – as the caricature went – could not be trusted, usually because his device was impractical. Jonathan Swift satirized natural philosophers of the Royal Society as &#x27;the academy of projectors&#x27; in his novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels.&quot; Historians of science have argued that natural philosophers and the so-called projectors sometimes overlapped in their methods and aims.

== Current work in the philosophy of science and nature==
In the middle of the 20th century, Ernst Mayr&#x27;s discussions on the teleology of nature brought up issues that were dealt with previously by Aristotle (regarding final cause) and Kant (regarding reflective judgment).

Especially since the mid-20th-century European crisis, some thinkers argued the importance of looking at nature from a broad philosophical perspective, rather than what they considered a narrowly positivist approach relying implicitly on a hidden, unexamined philosophy. One line of thought grows from the Aristotelian tradition, especially as developed by Thomas Aquinas. Another line springs from Edmund Husserl, especially as expressed in &quot;The Crisis of European Sciences&quot;. Students of his such as Jacob Klein and Hans Jonas more fully developed his themes. Last, but not least, there is the process philosophy inspired by Alfred North Whitehead&#x27;s works.

Among living scholars, Brian David Ellis, Nancy Cartwright, David Oderberg, and John Dupré are some of the more prominent thinkers who can arguably be classed as generally adopting a more open approach to the natural world. Ellis (2002) observes the rise of a &quot;New Essentialism&quot;. David Oderberg (2007) takes issue with other philosophers, including Ellis to a degree, who claim to be essentialists. He revives and defends the Thomistic-Aristotelian tradition from modern attempts to flatten nature to the limp subject of the experimental method. In Praise of Natural Philosophy: A Revolution for Thought and Life (2017), Nicholas Maxwell argues that we need to reform philosophy and put science and philosophy back together again to create a modern version of natural philosophy.

<text>Albany William Fonblanque (1793 – 13 October 1872) was an English journalist, and by his own example a reformer of the journalist&#x27;s profession.

==Family==
Fonblanque, descended from a French Huguenot family was born in London. His grandfather, John de Grenier Fonblanque, had been a banker naturalised in England under the name Fonblanque; his son, John Anthony Fonblanque, was Albany&#x27;s father. Albany&#x27;s mother, Frances Caroline Fitzgerald, was a granddaughter of Colonel Samuel Martin of Antigua, West Indies and niece of Samuel Martin. Her brother was the poet William Thomas Fitzgerald.

Albany Fonblanque married Caroline Keane. They had a daughter and three sons.

===Education===
Fonblanque was sent to Tonbridge School and then to the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, to prepare for a career in the Royal Engineers. However, his health fell short and his studies were suspended. On his recovery he studied law, with a view to being called to the bar. At the age of 19 (in 1812), he began writing for newspapers and soon gained attention for the boldness and liberality of his opinions and for the superiority of his style amid what Macaulay, when speaking of him, called the &quot;rant and twaddle&quot; of the daily and weekly press. While he shared in all the political struggles of this eventful period, he also studied classical and political philosophy for at least six hours a day. This regime led to his health breaking down again, but he continued to write regularly for newspapers and reviews and make a reasonable living.

From 1820 to 1830, Fonblanque was employed on the staff of &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, whilst contributing to the &quot;Examiner&quot; to the &quot;London Magazine&quot; and the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;.

==&quot;The Examiner&quot;==
In 1826, Fonblanque became political commentator for &quot;The Examiner&quot;, a weekly newspaper founded by Leigh and John Hunt in 1808. In 1828 the paper was purchased by Rev. Dr. Fellowes, author of the &quot;Religion of the Universe&quot; and other works, and given over to Fonblanque&#x27;s complete control. For 17 years up to 1847, he sustained the high character for political independence and literary ability that &quot;The Examiner&quot; had gained under the direction of Leigh Hunt and his brother John, and even compelled his political opponents to acknowledge some delight in the boldness and brightness of the wit he directed against them.

When it was proposed that supporters of the paper should facilitate a reduction in its price by paying their subscriptions ten years in advance, they were joined by Edward Bulwer-Lytton and by Benjamin Disraeli, who was then flirting with radicalism. Fonblanque remained at the &quot;Examiner&quot; despite many offers of other literary employment, resolving to make it a standard of literary excellence in journalism.

Fonblanque entirely took over &quot;The Examiner&quot; in 1830, serving as editor until 1847. Among the contributors he found were John Stuart Mill, John Forster, William Makepeace Thackeray, and most notably Charles Dickens. Fonblanque wrote the first notice of &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot; (on 28 February 1836) and of &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (on 4 September 1836). Forster became the magazine&#x27;s literary editor in 1835, and succeeded Fonblanque as editor from 1847 to 1855. Fonblanque retained ownership until 1865. The magazine ceased publication in 1886.

===Board of Trade===
Fonblanque was offered the governorship of Nova Scotia; but though greatly interested in colonial matters and using every effort to advocate a more generous political system leading to colonial self-government, he again decided not to abandon his beloved &quot;Examiner&quot;. In 1847, however, domestic reasons induced him to accept the post of statistical secretary of the Board of Trade. This compelled him to resign from &quot;The Examiner&quot;, although he continued to contribute to it under the control of John Forster. During the later years of his life Fonblanque took no prominent part in public affairs. He died aged 79. By then he was, as his nephew Edward Fonblanque observed, a man who had lived and toiled in an age gone by, in a cause long since established.

Albany Fonblanque&#x27;s political activity may be judged from his &quot;England under Seven Administrations&quot; (1837), which compares the course of social and political events in England from 1826 to 1837. As a journalist, he must be regarded in the light of a reformer.

==Changing attitudes to journalists==
Journalism before Fonblanque&#x27;s day was seen as a somewhat discreditable profession: men of culture were shy of entering it, lest they be confused with the ruder combatants fighting for public notice. Fonblanque, with his strong and earnest political convictions and exceptional literary ability, did not hesitate to choose the field as one where a politician and a man of letters might usefully and honourably put forth his gifts. A good account of him appears in the &quot;Life and Labours of Albany Fonblanque&quot;, edited by his nephew, Edward Barrington de Fonblanque (London, 1874). It includes a collection of his articles with a brief biographical notice.

<doc id="382253" wikidata="Q1240688" url="?curid=382253" title="Donativum">
<text>The donativum (plural &quot;donativa&quot;) was a gift of money by the Roman emperors to the soldiers of the Roman legions or to the Praetorian Guard. The English translation is &quot;&quot;.

The purpose of the &quot;donativa&quot; varied. Some were expressions of gratitude for favors received, and others outright bribery for favours expected in return. &quot;Donativa&quot; were normally rendered at the beginning of each new emperor&#x27;s reign. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries, that form of bribery became a crucial part of any successful ruler in Rome. Such was the case with many of the soldier-emperors from 235 to 248.

The Praetorian Guard, intimate to the emperor&#x27;s person, was an even greater threat to security. The cohorts stationed in Rome were difficult to appease and quick to assassinate. The &quot;donativum&quot; thus provided a significant way to purchase the Guard&#x27;s support and loyalty.

Emperor Augustus bequeathed the Praetorian Guard a substantial sum in his will, but it was not until the reign of Tiberius that gifts of money were thought to be mandatory. The Praetorian Guard received such gifts for turning a blind eye when Sejanus, the praetorian prefect, fell from power. Each Praetorian Guard received 10 gold pieces in return for not defending Sejanus.

In 41, after the assassination of Caligula, the Guard supported Claudius, and the Senate briefly learned that the Guard had installed him on the throne. Claudius gave them 150 gold pieces, or some 3,750 denarii to which the senators&#x27; 100 sesterces were added annually to commemorate Claudius&#x27;s accession. The inevitable result of the custom of the &quot;donativum&quot; was the Guard&#x27;s auctioning of the empire to Didius Julianus in 193.

<doc id="382256" wikidata="Q1934870" url="?curid=382256" title="Mobile Army Surgical Hospital">
<text>Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals (MASH) were U.S. Army field hospital units conceptualized in 1946 as replacements for the obsolete World War II-era Auxiliary Surgical Group hospital units. MASH units were in operation from the Korean War to the Gulf War before being phased out in the early 2000s, in favor of combat support hospitals. 

Each MASH unit had 60 beds, as well as surgical, nursing, and other enlisted and officer staff available at all times. MASH units filled a vital role in military medicine by providing support to army units upwards of 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers. These units had a low mortality rate compared to others, as the transportation time to hospitals was shorter, resulting in fewer patients dying within the &quot;Golden Hour&quot;, the first hour after an injury is first sustained, which is referred to in trauma as the &quot;most important hour&quot;. The U.S. Army deactivated the last MASH unit on February 16, 2006.

==History==
===In service===
====World War I====
A precursor to MASH units, the American Expeditionary Force Mobile Hospital 1 was established, following the example of the French military &quot;automobile-chirurgical units&quot; shortly after the American entry to the war.

====World War II====

Principles for a mobile medical unit and their implementation were established through trial and error in the dental field during World War II by Major Vincent P. Marran, a medic in the United States Third Army. The effectiveness of his efforts were widely admired and supported by the command structure, but no formal designation was established. The first trials for what would become MASH units were established by the U.S. Army during World War II. The necessity for the U.S. Army to have more convenient treatment centers was shown by the long logistics of the stretched out supply lines during World War II. These units were known as &quot;Auxiliary Surgical Groups&quot; and would care for the wounded much closer than permanent hospitals, making them hospitals. In the early 1940s, Colonel Michael DeBakey and his colleague were selected to give recommendations on how to provide surgical care for the U.S. Army. The result was the ASG. Although these units were very inexperienced, they were incredibly effective resulting in five ASG units being created in 1943; this resulted in the ASG units being able to move along with the U.S. Army units located in Italy and was the basis in which MASH would directly come from.

==== Korean War ====
Formally, the MASH unit was conceived by Michael E. DeBakey and other surgical consultants as the &quot;mobile army surgical hospital&quot;. Col. Harry A. Ferguson, the executive officer of the Tokyo Army Hospital, also aided in the establishment of the MASH program. It was an alternative to the random individual systems of portable surgical hospitals, field hospitals, and general hospitals used during World War II. It was designed to get experienced personnel closer to the front, so that the wounded could be treated sooner and with greater success. Casualties were first treated at the point of injury through buddy aid, then routed through Battalion Aid Stations for emergency stabilizing surgery, and finally routed to the MASH for the most extensive treatment. This proved to be highly successful; during the Korean War, a seriously wounded soldier who made it to a MASH unit alive had a greater than 97% chance of survival once he received treatment. MASH units often took 24 hours to set up at new locations once moved with armored units, trucks and airmobile. Airmobile or the early stages, known today as helicopters, were crucial to the war effort as they were fast traveling units that could pickup casualties and deliver them effectively back to MASH units. With mountainous terrain in Korea, this was crucial as ground transport could compromise the patients lives and would take longer to arrive to MASH units.

In 1997, the last MASH unit in South Korea was deactivated. A deactivating ceremony was held in South Korea, which was attended by several members of the cast of the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; television series, including Larry Linville (who played Frank Burns), and David Ogden Stiers (who played Charles Winchester).

==== Vietnam War ====
The Vietnam War had little action for the MASH units within the U.S Army. The Vietnam War marked the demise of the MASH units as only one unit, known as the &quot;2nd MASH Unit&quot;, served actively, and only from October 1966 to July 1967. The Vietnam War was a very different environment from the Korean War which MASH units were created in. The Vietnam War required a change from MASH to &quot;MUST&quot;, or &quot;Medical Unit, Self-contained, Transportable&quot; units. MUST units had trailers, inflatable sections, and technology focused on a wider range of wounds from war. In MUST units the wounds were greatly different than in the Korean War resulting in many changes needed to the units as a whole with new innovations required. New treatments were also needed for burn victims with MASH units suffering a mortality rate of up to 90% for burn victims. Although this clearly showed progress in the medical field, the type of warfare changed making MASH obsolete in many cases. MUST units had to keep their equipment on standby at all times effectively replacing MASH units and later transferring into more revolutionized units in war-zones. The idea of a MASH unit is to be available at all times to those who have been wounded in combat on the front and required general or trauma surgery but as technology got better, there was a lot more room to improve transportation, technology used to treat soldiers, and the layout of these units resulting in MASH units being converted to MUST units.

==== Gulf War ====
During the Gulf War, in September 1990, the main body of the 5th MASH, 44th Medical Brigade, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, deployed to King Abdul-Aziz Air Base, Royal Saudi Air Force, Daharan Saudi Arabia and was the first fully functional Army hospital in the country. Their forward surgical team and Advanced Party had deployed in mid August to Daharan. This unit moved forward six times, always as the first up hospital for the region. In February 1991, the 5th MASH was operationally attached to the 24th Infantry Division to provide forward surgical care (often right on the front battle lines) to the combat units that attacked the western flank of the Iraqi army. In March 1991, the 159th MASH of the Louisiana Army National Guard operated in Iraq in support of the 3rd Armored Division during Operation Desert Storm.

Other MASH units that served in 1990–91 included the 2nd MASH, 1st Medical Group, Benning; the 10th MASH, 1st Medical Group, Carson; the 115th MASH (DCARNG); the 475th MASH (341st Med Group, KY USAR); the 807th MASH (341st Med Group, KY USAR); and the 912th MASH (TN USAR).

==== Operation Iraqi Freedom ====

The 212th MASH – based in Miesau Ammo Depot, Germany – was deployed to Iraq in 2003, supporting coalition forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was the most decorated combat hospital in the U.S. Army, with 28 campaign streamers on the organizational colors. The 212th MASH&#x27;s last deployment was to Pakistan to support the 2005 Kashmir earthquake relief operations. The U.S. State Department bought the MASH&#x27;s tents and medical equipment, owned by the DoD, and donated the entire hospital to the Pakistani military, a donation worth $4.5 million.

==== Conversion to Combat Support Hospital ====
Internationally, the last MASH unit in the U.S. Army was converted to a Combat Support Hospital on October 16, 2006.

The 212th MASH&#x27;s unit sign now resides at the Army Medical Department&#x27;s Museum in San Antonio, Texas.

In addition, one of the last MASH units worldwide was located in Pakistan serving as a civilian hospital to aid in recovery efforts following an earthquake in 2006. Known as the 212th MASH unit which was originally in Miesau, Germany, it was re-established for the Iraq War. In addition to treating soldiers, they treated over thirty thousand civilians. With an average survival rate of 97%, this was impressive considering how many victims there were of an earthquake and the longevity of these units from the late 1940s to the early 2000s. Although these hospitals were very effective in being able to provide suitable care to those in the battlefield and civilian populations, the MASH units soon became obsolete as MASH units were made for conventional wars; the Vietnam War, the Gulf War and the Iraq War were in different terrains than they were designed for resulting in different needs as they were much harder to traverse than Korea. New transportation vehicles such as the Bell H-13 (known as the first evac helicopter) and later the Sikorsky UH-60 made airmobile and other ground units ineffective in desert and tropical terrain. Lastly, technology made for treating patients in the operating room and elsewhere has gotten much more complex resulting in more space and care needed to treat soldiers along with many fewer troops being deployed.

==Field care==
The Korean War played a great role in defining MASH units. High casualties in the front line called for onsite paramedic care, such as ambulances and medical tents. Having learned from World War II that transporting wounded soldiers to rear hospitals was highly inefficient in reducing mortality rate, MASH units were established near front lines to supply mobile and flexible military medical care. They contributed to making improvements in resuscitation and trauma care, patient transport, blood storage and distribution, patient triage, and evacuation. The aeromedical evacuation system was developed to transport soldiers by aircraft at a quicker pace. Helicopters were frequently used as &quot;air ambulances&quot; during the Korean War, with the Bell H-13 serving as a predominant medical evacuation aircraft during the war. Military doctors stabilized wounded soldiers midair before getting them to a field hospital. MASH onsite paramedic care and air ambulance system decreased post evacuation mortality from 4% in World War II to 2.5% in the Korean War.

==Triage==

MASH units played an important role in the development of the triage system, a technique that underscores emergency room (ER) medicine in hospitals today.

The system allows for caregivers to prioritize patient&#x27;s wounds and injuries in order to get those who are severely injured treated as soon as possible. The patient&#x27;s status is determined an overview of their respiratory, perfusion, and mental status. The current triage system consists of color-coding; each patient (and at times their different wounds) are tagged with either a black, red, yellow, or green tag.

While the concept of triage had been used years before the Korean War, it wasn&#x27;t until MASH units put it into real practice that the idea was fully developed. World War I and World War II saw the introduction of chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, which created a large influx of casualties and the need for more organization. Triage was first performed on the soldiers at battalion aid stations. Those who worked in the stations, be they nurses or medical officers, used the system to determine which soldiers needed further care or treatment and which soldiers could go back onto the battlefield. The soldiers that needed further treatment were then transferred to the MASH units to undergo triage once more. This time, nurses and doctors would work to prioritize who needed to be taken into surgery first; if it appeared that the soldier wouldn&#x27;t survive much longer without surgery they were prioritized. MASH units typically followed the saying, &quot;life takes precedence over limb, function over anatomical defects&quot;, a phrase which essentially means that they had to repair the most serious defect first. This thought process has since rolled over to the modern technique of triage in ERs nationwide.

== In popular culture ==

The MASH unit made its way into popular culture through the 1968 novel &quot;&quot; by Richard Hooker, the 1970 feature film based on the novel, and the long-running television sitcom (1972–1983) also based on the novel. A 1953 film, &quot;Battle Circus&quot;, also took place at a MASH.
For narrative simplicity, the &quot;4077th MASH&quot; unit depicted in the novel, movie, and television series was smaller than real MASH units. The fictional 4077th consisted of four general surgeons and one neurosurgeon, around 10 nurses, and 50–70 enlisted men. In an average 24-hour period, they could go through 300 wounded soldiers. By comparison, the 8076th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital had personnel including 10 medical officers, 12 nursing officers, and 89 enlisted soldiers of assorted medical and non-medical specialties. On one occasion, the unit handled over 600 casualties in a 24-hour period.

<text>The World Assemblies of God Fellowship (WAGF) is a global cooperative body of over 170 Pentecostal denominations that was established on August 15, 1989. WAGF was created to provide structure so that member denominations, which previously related to each other informally, could more easily cooperate on a global basis. 

The organizational committee, in 1988 summarized the purposes for the WAGF:
# Promote and facilitate world evangelization.
# Coordinate world relief.
# Coordinate the use of media and other technological resources to promote the cause of Christ in a way pleasing to Him.
# Provide a strong international platform to speak out on behalf of the suffering and persecuted churches.
# Coordinate theological education.
# Produce an international directory of Pentecostal churches, missions and other Pentecostal agencies to help share information.

Member denominations are independent and autonomous, but they are united by shared beliefs and history.

==History==
===Origins===

WAGF member denominations have varied histories. Most have roots in the interracial Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, California or other Pentecostal revivals around the world in the early twentieth century. The largest member denomination, Assembleia de Deus in Brazil, dates its beginning to 1911. Initially called Missão de Fé Apostólica (Apostolic Faith Mission), it changed its name in 1918 to Assembleia de Deus. 

The Assemblies of God USA, organized in April 1914, was the first Pentecostal denomination to name itself Assemblies of God. The Assemblies of God USA was founded by about 300 preachers and laymen from 20 states and several foreign countries met for a general council in Hot Springs, Arkansas, United States. While most other U.S. Pentecostal denominations were regionally defined, the Assemblies of God claimed a broad nationwide constituency.

A new fellowship emerged from the meeting and was incorporated under the name General Council of the Assemblies of God in the United States of America.

In time, self-governing and self-supporting general councils broke off from the original fellowship or formed independently in several nations throughout the world, originating either from indigenous Pentecostal movements or as a direct result of the indigenous missions strategy of the General Council. In 1919, Pentecostals in Canada united to form the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, which formally affiliated with the Assemblies of God USA the following year. The Assemblies of God in Great Britain formed in 1924 and would have an early influence on the Assemblies of God in Australia, now known as Australian Christian Churches. The Australian Assemblies of God formed in 1937 through a merger of the Pentecostal Church of Australia and the Assemblies of God Queensland. The Queensland AG had formed in 1929; though, it was never formally affiliated with the AG in America. The Assemblies of God of South Africa, founded in 1925, like the AG Queensland was also not initially aligned with the US fellowship.

Before 1967, the Assemblies of God USA, along with the majority of other Pentecostal denominations, officially opposed Christian participation in war and considered itself a peace church. The US Assemblies of God continues to give full doctrinal support to members who are led by religious conscience to pacifism.

===International fellowship===
Through foreign missionary work and establishing relationships with other Pentecostal churches, the Assemblies of God expanded into a worldwide movement. It was not until 1989 that the world fellowship was formed.

In 1989, the various Assemblies of God national fellowships united to form the World Pentecostal Assemblies of God Fellowship at the initiative of Dr. J. Philip Hogan, then executive director of the Division of Foreign Missions of the Assemblies of God in the United States. The initial purpose was to coordinate evangelism, but soon developed into a more permanent organism of inter-relation.

Dr. Hogan was elected the first chairman of the Fellowship and served until 1992 when Rev. David Yonggi Cho was elected chairman. In 1993, the name of the Fellowship was changed to the World Assemblies of God Fellowship. In 2000, Thomas E. Trask was elected to succeed Cho. At the 2008 World Congress in Lisbon, Portugal, George O. Wood, General Superintendent of the Assemblies of God in the United States, was elected chairman. At the 2011 World AG Congress in Chennai, India, David Mohan, General Superintendent of the All India Assemblies of God, was elected vice chairman. Dominic Yeo of the Assemblies of God in Singapore was elected chairman in 2023.

== Statistics ==
According to a census published by the association in 2024, it has 450,106 churches and 86.1 million members and adherents worldwide.

==Beliefs==
The doctrinal position of the Assemblies of God is framed in a classical Pentecostal and evangelical context. The AG is Trinitarian. It believes that the Bible is divinely inspired and the infallible authoritative rule of faith and conduct. Baptism by immersion is practiced as an ordinance instituted by Christ for those who have been saved. Baptism is understood as an outward sign of an inward change from being dead in sin to being alive in Christ. As an ordinance, Communion is also practiced. The AG believes that the elements that are partaken are symbols which express the sharing of the divine nature of Jesus of Nazareth; a memorial of His suffering and death; and a prophecy of His second coming. The Assemblies of God also strongly emphasizes the fulfillment of the Great Commission and believes this is the church&#x27;s calling.

As classical Pentecostals, the Assemblies of God believes all Christians are entitled to and should seek baptism in the Holy Spirit. The AG teaches that this experience is distinct from and subsequent to the experience of salvation. Baptism in the Holy Spirit empowers the believer for Christian life and service. The initial evidence of baptism in the Holy Spirit is speaking in tongues &quot;as the Spirit gives utterance&quot; (Acts 2:4). It also believes in the present-day use of other spiritual gifts such as divine healing.

The Assemblies of God ordains women as pastors, which many Christians, especially from evangelical denominations, but also from traditional churches such as Orthodox and Catholic denominations, consider liberal and progressive. Pentecostal and Charismatic denominations have traditionally allowed women to serve in pastoral ministry.

While the World AG Fellowship has a statement of faith that outlines the basic beliefs that unify the various branches of the movement, each national AG denomination formulates its own doctrinal statements. The Assemblies of God USA, for example, adheres to the Statement of Fundamental Truths.

== Politics ==
The most prominent politician within the Assemblies of God is former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. He has said, &quot;the Bible is not a policy handbook, and I get very worried when people try to treat it like one&quot;. In late 2017, Morrison said he would become a stronger advocate for protections for religious freedom.

In Brazil, the local branch has had an increasing influence on politics throughout the early 21st century. The Christian fundamentalist party Patriota was in a parliamental coalition with the Bolsonaro government as well as the centre-right Partido Social Cristão, which was then led by two AG pastors, Everaldo Pereira and Marco Feliciano, who were accused in various cases of crime and sexual misconduct. Everaldo was arrested for his participation in a corruption scheme in the state-owned company of water treatment of the State of Rio de Janeiro, ; Feliciano proved his innocence and that he was a victim of a conspiracy planned by former PSC member Patricia Lelis, who was charged with false reporting and extortion before fleeing to the United States, where she was again charged and arrested for the same crime.

Another Brazilian politician and AG member, Marina Silva, pursues ecologist ideas and supports the rights of the indigenous tribes of her country. The church leadership has criticized Silva&#x27;s leftist stances on many issues, such as drug reform.

Within the United States of America, the majority of its membership vote or lean Republican. During Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency, General Superintendent George O. Wood attended the National Day of Prayer and praised an executive order allowing ministers and religious organizations to support and advocate for political candidates.

==Organization==

The World Fellowship unites Assemblies of God national councils from around the world together for cooperation. Each national council is fully self-governing and independent and involvement with the World Fellowship does not limit this independence. The work of the World Fellowship is carried out by the Executive Council. Executive Council members represent different regions of the world and serve three-year terms. Africa, Asia Pacific, Latin America/Caribbean, and North America each have four representatives, Europe has three, and the Middle East and Southern Asia each have one. They are elected by the General Assembly. Each World Fellowship member is entitled to send one or more delegates to the General Assembly with one vote. The General Assembly also elects the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Secretary of the World Fellowship. At both the national and lower level, the Assemblies of God are generally structured around a form of presbyterian polity, combining the independence of the local church with oversight by district and national councils.

The World Assemblies of God Relief Agency (WAGRA) directs its humanitarian work.

<doc id="382259" wikidata="Q371343" url="?curid=382259" title="London River Services">
<text>London River Services Limited is a division of Transport for London (TfL), which manages passenger transport—leisure-oriented tourist services and commuter services—on the River Thames in London. It does not own or operate any boats itself, except those of the Woolwich Ferry, but licenses the services of operators.

River service had been a common means of transport in London for centuries, but died off in the early 1900s, as transportation was enhanced (and river traffic somewhat blocked) with a proliferation of bridges and tunnels. With these numerous north–south crossings of the Thames, which is generally no more than 300m wide as it runs through central London, the revival of river boat services in London therefore mostly travel east or west along the Thames rather than across it; the only major cross-river ferry services are to be found further downstream where the river is wider, and there are far fewer bridge/tunnel crossings.

The decision to revive London&#x27;s river service network moved forward in 1997 with the launch of &quot;Thames&quot;, a £21-million project (£ million today) to regenerate the River Thames and create new passenger transport services on the Thames. While the service is not as extensive as those of Hong Kong or Sydney, it has been growing: in 2007, more than 700,000 commuters travelled by river on Thames Clippers services, one of the operators on the system; in 2013 the Thames Clippers service had grown to 3.3 million, as it had become more integrated into the tube and bus ticketing network; in 2014 their figure was 3.8 million; in 2015 it was forecasted that their ridership would increase to 4.3 million by 2016, supported by the addition of new Clipper boats. By 2018, there were 21 different operators carrying daily commuter, leisure, charter, or sightseeing passengers to various combinations of the 33 piers on the system.

==History==

Before the construction of London&#x27;s bridges and the Underground, the River Thames had served as a major thoroughfare for centuries. Attempts to regulate the transport of passengers and goods began in 1197, when King Richard I sold the Crown&#x27;s rights over the Thames to the City of London Corporation, which then attempted to license boats on the river. In 1510 Henry VIII granted a licence to watermen that gave exclusive rights to carry passengers on the river, and in 1555 an Act of Parliament set up the Company of Watermen and Lightermen to control traffic on the Thames.

For centuries the only bridge across the Thames was London Bridge. Crossing the river by wherry (small wooden rowing boat) was a common mode of transport.

===19th century===

Passenger steamboats were introduced in 1815 and the use of the river as a means of public transport increased greatly. River services ran from Gravesend, Margate and Ramsgate via Greenwich and Woolwich into central London. By the mid-1850s about 15,000 people per day travelled to work on steamboat services – twice the number of passengers on the newly emerging railways. With increased congestion on the river, collisions and other accidents became correspondingly more frequent, most notably with the &quot;Princess Alice&quot; disaster at Woolwich in 1878.

While the introduction of large steamboats and bridge construction had taken business from the Thames watermen, the growth of the railways took passengers away from the steamboat services and the use of the river for public transport began a steady decline. River service companies struggled financially, and in 1876 the five main boat companies merged to form the London Steamboat Company. The company ran a half-hourly service from Chelsea to Greenwich for eight years until it went bankrupt in 1884. Nevertheless, river services continued under different management into the next century. Many of the Thames paddle steamers around this time were built by the Thames Ironworks at Bow Creek.

===20th century===

In 1905 the London County Council (LCC) launched its own public river transport service to complement its new tram network, acquiring piers and investing in a large fleet of 30 paddle-steamers. Frequent services operated from Hammersmith to Greenwich. The LCC river service was not a success; in the first year it ran up debts of £30,000. It was shut down in 1907 after only two years&#x27; service.

Numerous proposals for &quot;river bus&quot; services were considered throughout the 20th century, although the few that were realised were cancelled after a short time in service. During World War II, from 13 September 1940 to 2 November 1940, a temporary wartime river bus service was introduced, running every 20 minutes, between Westminster and Woolwich using converted pleasure cruisers provided by the Port of London Authority to replace train, tram and trolleybus services which were disrupted by the bombing of the Blitz. London Transport bus inspectors and conductors issued and checked the tickets on board the boats.

With the move of the Port of London downstream in the 1960s, regular river transport was limited to a few sightseeing boats.

===Revival of passenger services===
In 1997 Secretary of State for Transport John Prescott launched Thames 2000, a £21-million project to regenerate the River Thames in time for the Millennium Celebrations and boost new passenger transport services on the Thames. The centrepiece of these celebrations was to be the Millennium Dome, but there was also a plan to provide a longer-term legacy of public transport boat services and piers on the river.

The Cross-River Partnership, a consortium of local authorities, private sector organisations and voluntary bodies, recommended the creation of a public body to co-ordinate and promote river services. This agency, provisionally titled the Thames Piers Agency, would integrate boat services into other modes of public transport, take control of Thames piers from the Port of London Authority, and commission the construction of new piers.

The result was the formation in 1999 of London River Services (LRS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London.

Mayor Ken Livingstone&#x27;s &quot;Transport Strategy for London&quot; 2005 stated that: &quot;The safe use of the Thames for passenger and freight services should be developed. Passenger services will be encouraged, particularly services that relate to its cultural and architectural excellence and tourism. Use of London&#x27;s other navigable waterways for freight, consistent with their roles for leisure use and as ecosystems, will be encouraged.&quot;

===21st century===
Today, LRS is responsible for integrating river transport with the rest of the public transport network, such as the Tube and buses. It promotes boat services under the London River Services brand, issuing timetables and river maps.

LRS is also responsible for directly managing eight piers on the river, and invested in LRS-branded signage and passenger information.

LRS supports the Thames Clipper commuter service financially and increased the peak service frequency to a boat every 15 minutes. In April 2009 the signing of a &quot;River Concordat&quot; by London&#x27;s pier owners, boat operators, borough councils and Transport for London was announced, committing the various parties to improving ticketing, piers and passenger information, and to closer integration into the transport network.

London River Services is not responsible for maintaining the river itself; the Port of London Authority takes care of river traffic control, security, navigational safety (including buoys, beacons, bridge lights and channel surveys), and the RNLI operates Thames lifeboat services.

==Branding==
The public presentation of London River Services is visually associated with existing TfL design standards, using identical graphic design elements to those used on London Underground publicity, signage and other elements, drawing on the design heritage of Frank Pick.

The London River Services brand is a sub-brand of TfL which uses the familiar Tube roundel, originally devised for London Underground and now established as the corporate branding for all TfL services. The River Services roundel is a dark blue (Pantone 072) bar on pale blue (Pantone 299) circle.

The corporate signage, stationery and literature of TfL services, including LRS, use the New Johnston typeface.

LRS publishes diagrammatic river maps in the style of Harry Beck&#x27;s iconic Tube map. Tube maps published by TfL since 2000 denote river interchange stations with a boat symbol.

==Services==
The service patterns advertised by TfL can vary according to season. They are divided into three main types:

===River Bus commuter services===

Numbered River Bus services (abbreviated to &quot;RB&quot;) run to a timetable through the day with more frequent services during peak rush hour times. Most services run seven days a week, although some do not operate at weekends. Many operators offer discounted fares to Travelcard holders. The main lines of operation are:

The catamaran-hulled vessels have on-board coffee bars, airline-style seating, are wheelchair-accessible and have bicycle racks.

===Ferry services===

In central London, the River Thames is narrow enough to allow it to be crossed by many bridges; further downstream however, the river widens and there are fewer bridge crossings. Two ferry services are still in operation:

Two other ferry services operate upstream in west London: Hammerton&#x27;s Ferry and the Hampton Ferry. These services are independent of London River Services as they do not serve LRS-managed piers.

===Leisure services===

Leisure boats are aimed mainly at the tourist market; as they do not usually provide rush hour services, they are not normally suitable for commuting. Some boat companies run regular scheduled services, others may run twice daily, only on certain days of the week, or only during certain months of the year. Boats may also be chartered for private hire. Destinations are often tourist attractions such as the Tate Galleries or Hampton Court Palace.

==Operators==
Scheduled tourist and commuter services on the river are operated by a number of private companies, including:

Charter services, usually catering for large parties, are also available from these and other operators.

==Piers==
London River Services lists 24 piers on the River Thames in its publications, of which 8 are managed directly by LRS.

===Millennium Piers===

In 2000, five new piers were opened with funding from the Millennium Commission under its Thames 2000 project, with a grant of £7,177,000:
* Tower Millennium Pier
* Blackfriars Millennium Pier
* London Eye Pier
* Westminster Millennium Pier
* Millbank Millennium Pier

The new piers were provided to improve previously neglected travel connections on the Thames and promote the river as an alternative means of public transport.

===List of piers===
Scheduled tourist and commuter services use the following piers, although no single service serves all the piers listed. The piers are listed in order going downstream:

==Fares and ticketing==

Unlike the underground and bus networks, boat operators have their own separate ticketing arrangements and charge separate fares which are generally higher than corresponding journeys by tube or bus. The only exception is the Woolwich Ferry, which is free of charge.

Oyster card is valid on most Thames Clipper services for single fares, offering a ten percent discount. Most boat operators offer discounts to Travelcard holders, as well as to Freedom Pass holders and students.

Ticket sales at piers are managed independently by the operators, and tickets are sold at separate kiosks with no facility for cross-ticketing. Many piers have a line of several sales desks, each owned by a different boat firm. Single tickets can often be bought on board the boat, but this is down to individual operator arrangements.

Some operators offer their own season tickets and carnets of single tickets. Thames Clipper, for example, offer a one-day Roamer ticket which allows multiple journeys within off-peak hours.

<doc id="382260" wikidata="Q464957" url="?curid=382260" title="Noor Inayat Khan">
<text>Noor-un-Nisa Inayat Khan, GC (1 January 1914 – 13 September 1944), also known as Nora Inayat-Khan and Nora Baker, was a British resistance agent in France in the Second World War who served in the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers, especially those occupied by Nazi Germany.

As an SOE agent under the codename Madeleine she became the first female wireless operator to be sent from the UK into occupied France to aid the French Resistance during the Second World War. Inayat Khan was betrayed and captured, and executed at Dachau concentration camp. She was posthumously awarded the George Cross for her service, the highest civilian decoration for gallantry in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Noor Inayat Khan was born on 1 January 1914, in Moscow. She was the eldest of four children. Her siblings were Vilayat Inayat Khan, an author and Sufi teacher; Hidayat Inayat Khan, a composer and Sufi teacher; and Khair-un-Nisa Inayat Khan.

Her father, Inayat Khan, was born in Baroda, Bombay Presidency, and came from a family of Indian Muslims with hereditary nobles and classical musicians among both sides of his ancestors. Inayat Khan&#x27;s great-great-grandfather was Tipu Sultan the ruler of Mysore. Inayat Khan lived in Europe as a musician and a teacher of Sufism. Her mother, Pirani Ameena Begum (born Ora Ray Baker), was an American from Albuquerque, New Mexico, who had met Inayat Khan during his travels in the United States. Afterwards, Vilayat became head of the Sufi Order of the West, later the Sufi Order International, and now the Inayati Order.

In 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, the family left Russia for Britain, and lived in the Bloomsbury neighborhood of London. Noor attended nursery in Notting Hill. In 1920, the family moved to France, settling in Suresnes near Paris, in a house that was a gift from a benefactor of the Sufi movement. As a young girl, Noor was described as quiet, shy, sensitive, and dreamy. After the death of her father in 1927, 13-year-old Noor took on the responsibility for her younger siblings from her grief-stricken mother. She studied child psychology at the Sorbonne, and also music at the Paris Conservatory under Nadia Boulanger, composing for both harp and piano.

As a young woman, Noor began a career as a writer, publishing her poetry and children&#x27;s stories in English and French and becoming a regular contributor to children&#x27;s magazines and French radio. In 1939, her book &quot;Twenty Jataka Tales&quot;, inspired by the &quot;Jataka tales&quot; of Buddhist tradition, was published in London by George G. Harrap and Co.

During the Second World War, when France was conquered by Nazi Germany, the family fled to Bordeaux and then by sea to Britain, landing at Falmouth, Cornwall, on 22 June 1940. Initially they stayed in Southampton, at the parental home of the philosopher Basil Mitchell.

==Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force==
Although Noor was deeply influenced by pacifist ideals, she and her brother Vilayat decided they wanted to help defeat Nazi tyranny: &quot;I wish some Indians would win high military distinction in this war. If one or two could do something in the Allied service which was very brave and which everybody admired it would help to make a bridge between the English people and the Indians.&quot;

In November 1940, Noor joined the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) and, as an Aircraftwoman 2nd Class, was sent to be trained as a wireless operator. Upon assignment to a bomber training school in June 1941, she applied for a commission in an effort to relieve herself of the boring work there.

==Special Operations Executive==
Later, Noor Inayat Khan was recruited to join F (France) Section of the Special Operations Executive; and in early February 1943 she was posted to the Air Ministry, Directorate of Air Intelligence, seconded to First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY). She was sent to Wanborough Manor, near Guildford in Surrey, after which she was ordered to Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, for special training as a wireless operator in occupied territory.

She was the first woman to be sent over in such a capacity, as all the woman agents before her had been sent as couriers. Having had previous wireless telegraphy (W/T) training, Noor had an edge on those who were just beginning their radio training, and was considered both fast and accurate.

From Aylesbury, Noor went on to Beaulieu, where the security training was capped with a practice mission – in the case of wireless operators, to find a place in a strange city from which they could transmit back to their instructors without being detected by an agent unknown to them who would be shadowing them.

The ultimate training exercise was the mock Gestapo interrogation, intended to give agents a taste of what might be in store for them if they were captured, and some practice in maintaining their cover story. Noor&#x27;s escaping officer found her interrogation &quot;almost unbearable&quot; and reported that &quot;she seemed terrified … so overwhelmed she nearly lost her voice&quot;, and that afterwards, &quot;she was trembling and quite blanched.&quot;
Her final report read: &quot;Not overburdened with brains but has worked hard and shown keenness, apart from some dislike of the security side of the course. She has an unstable and temperamental personality and it is very doubtful whether she is really suited to work in the field.&quot; Next to this comment, Maurice Buckmaster, the head of F Section, had written in the margin &quot;Nonsense&quot; and that &quot;We don&#x27;t want them overburdened with brains.&quot;

Noor&#x27;s superiors held mixed opinions on her suitability for secret warfare, and her training was incomplete due to the need to get trained W/T operators into the field. Khan&#x27;s &quot;childlike&quot; qualities, particularly her gentle manner and &quot;lack of ruse&quot;, had greatly worried her instructors at SOE&#x27;s training schools. One instructor wrote that &quot;she confesses that she would not like to have to do anything &#x27;two faced&#x27;&quot;, while another said she was &quot;very feminine in character, very eager to please, very ready to adapt herself to the mood of the company; the one of the conversation, capable of strong attachments, kind hearted, emotional, imaginative.&quot; A further observer said: &quot;Tends to give far too much information. Came here without the foggiest idea what she was being trained for.&quot; Others later commented that she was physically unsuited, saying she would not easily disappear into a crowd.

Physically quite small in stature, Noor received poor athletic reports from her instructors: &quot;Can run very well but otherwise clumsy. Unsuitable for jumping&quot; &quot;Pretty scared of weapons but tries hard to get over it.&quot; Noor was training as a W/T operator, and in that field she was getting quite adequate reports. Her &quot;fist&quot;, or style of tapping the keys, was somewhat heavy, apparently owing to her fingers being swollen by chilblains, but her speed was improving every day. Khan, who played the harp, was a natural signaller like many talented musicians.

Further, Vera Atkins (the intelligence officer for F Section) insisted Noor&#x27;s commitment was unquestioned, as another training report had readily confirmed: &quot;She felt she had come to a dead end in the WAAF, and was longing to do something more active in the prosecution of the war, something that would demand more sacrifice.&quot; So when Suttill&#x27;s request first came, Vera saw Noor as a natural choice, and although her final training in field security and encoding had to be cut short, she judged her ready to go.

Noor&#x27;s mission would be an especially dangerous one. So successful had female couriers been that the decision was made to use them as wireless operators as well, which was even more dangerous work, probably the most dangerous work of all. The job of the operator was to maintain a link between the circuit in the field and London, sending and receiving messages about planned sabotage operations or about where arms were needed for resistance fighters. Without such communication it was almost impossible for any resistance strategy to be co-ordinated, but the operators were highly vulnerable to detection which was improving as the war progressed.

Hiding themselves as best they could, with aerials strung up in attics or disguised as washing lines, they tapped out Morse on the key of transmitters, and would often wait alone for hours for a reply saying the messages had been received. If they stayed on the air transmitting for more than 20 minutes, their signals were likely to be picked up by the enemy, and detection vans would trace the source of these suspect signals. When the operator moved location, the bulky transmitter had to be carried, sometimes concealed in a suitcase or in a bundle of firewood. If stopped and searched, the operator would have no cover story to explain the transmitter. In 1943, an operator&#x27;s life expectancy was six weeks.

Noor had been staying at a country house in Buckinghamshire, a place where agents had a final chance to adjust to their new identities and consider their missions before departure. Noor&#x27;s conducting officer, a female companion who watched over agents in training, told Atkins that Noor had descended into a gloom and was clearly troubled by the thought of what she was about to undertake. Then two fellow agents staying with Noor at the country house had written directly to Vera to say they felt she should not go. Such an intervention at this stage was most unusual.
Atkins decided to call Noor back to London, to meet and talk. Vilayat remembered trying to stop his sister going on her mission exactly at the time of this meeting. &quot;You see, Nora and I had been brought up with the policy of Gandhi&#x27;s nonviolence, and at the outbreak of war we discussed what we would do&quot;, said Vilayat, who had followed his father and become a Sufi mystic. &quot;She said, &#x27;Well, I must do something, but I don&#x27;t want to kill anyone.&#x27; So I said, &#x27;Well, if we are going to join the war, we have to involve ourselves in the most dangerous positions, which would mean no killing.&#x27; Then, when we eventually go to England, I volunteered for minesweeping and she volunteered for SOE, and so I have always had a feeling of guilt because of what I said that day.&quot;

Noor and Atkins met at Manetta&#x27;s, a restaurant in Mayfair. Atkins wanted to confirm that Noor believed in her own ability to succeed. Confidence was the most important thing for any agent. However poor Noor&#x27;s jumping or even her encoding, Atkins believed those agents who did well were those who knew before they set off that they could do the job. Her intention was to let Noor feel she had an opportunity to back out gracefully should she so wish. Atkins began by asking if she was happy in what she was doing. Noor looked startled and said: &quot;Yes, of course.&quot;

Atkins then told her about the letter and its contents. Noor was reportedly upset that anybody would think she was unfit. &quot;You know that if you have any doubts, it is not too late to turn back… If you don&#x27;t feel you&#x27;re the typeif for any reason whatever you don&#x27;t want to go you only have to tell me now. I&#x27;ll arrange everything so that you have no embarrassment. You will be transferred to another branch of the service with no adverse mark on your file. We have every respect for the man or woman who admits frankly to not feeling up to it&quot;, Atkins told her, adding: &quot;For us there is only one crime: to go out there and let your comrades down.&quot;

Noor insisted adamantly that she wanted to go and was competent for the work. Her only concern, she said, was her family, and Vera sensed immediately that this was, as she had suspected, where the problem lay. Noor had found saying goodbye to her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, she said. As Vera had advised her, she had told her mother only half the truth: she had said she was going abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.

Atkins asked if there was anything she could do to help with family matters. Noor said that, should she go missing, she would like Atkins to avoid worrying her mother as far as possible. The normal procedure, as Noor knew, was that when an agent went to the field, Vera would send out a periodic &quot;good news&quot; letters to the family, letting them know the person concerned was well. If the agent went missing, the family would be told so. What Noor was suggesting was that bad news should be broken to her mother only if it was beyond any doubt that she was dead. Atkins said she would agree to this arrangement if it was what she wanted. With this assurance Noor seemed content and confident once more. Any doubts in Atkins&#x27;s mind were also now apparently settled.
Atkins always accompanied the woman agents to the departure airfields, if she possibly could. Those who were not dropped into France by parachute (as were agents like Andrée Borrel and Lise de Baissac) were flown in on Lysanders, a light monowing transport aircraft designed to land on short and rough fields. These planes were met by a &quot;reception committee&quot; consisting of SOE agents and local French helpers. The reception committees were alerted to imminent arrival of a plane by a BBC action message inserted as a &quot;message personnel&quot;; these were broadcast across France every evening, mostly for ordinary listeners wishing to contact friends or family separated by war. The messages broadcast for SOE, agreed in advance between HQ and the circuit organizer, usually by wireless signal, sounded like odd greetings or aphorisms&quot;Le hibou n&#x27;est pas un éléphant&quot; (The owl is not an elephant)but the reception committee on the ground would know that the message meant a particular (pre-planned) operation would take place.

Promoted to Assistant Section Officer (the WAAF equivalent of RAF pilot officer), Noor was to fly by Lysander with the June moon to a field near Angers, from where she would make her way to Paris to link up with the leader of a Prosper sub-circuit named Emile Garry, or Cinema, an alias chosen because of his uncanny resemblance to the film star Gary Cooper. Once on the ground Noor would make contact with the Prosper circuit organizer, Francis Suttill, and take on her new persona as a children&#x27;s nurse, &quot;Jeanne-Marie Renier&quot;, using fake papers in that name. To her SOE colleagues, however, she would be known simply as &quot;Madeleine&quot;.

Regardless of her perceived shortcomings, Noor&#x27;s fluent French and her competency in wireless operationcoupled with a shortage of experienced agentsmade her a desirable candidate for service in Nazi-occupied France. On 16/17 June 1943, cryptonymed &#x27;Madeleine&#x27;/W/T operator &#x27;Nurse&#x27; and under the cover identity of Jeanne-Marie Regnier, Assistant Section Officer Noor was flown to landing ground B/20A &#x27;Indigestion&#x27; in Northern France on a night landing double Lysander operation, code named Teacher/Nurse/Chaplain/Monk, along with agents Diana Rowden (code named Paulette/Chaplain), and Cecily Lefort (code named Alice/Teacher). They were met by Henri Déricourt.

==Capture and imprisonment==
From 24 June 1943 the &#x27;Prosper&#x27; network that Noor had been sent to be a radio operator for began to be rounded up by the Germans. Noor remained in radio contact with London. When Buckmaster told her she would be flown home, she told him she would prefer to remain, as she believed she was the only radio operator remaining in Paris. Buckmaster agreed to this, though she was told only to receive signals, not to transmit.

Noor Inayat Khan was betrayed to the Germans, possibly by Renée Garry. Garry was the sister of Émile Henri Garry, the head agent of the &#x27;Cinema&#x27; and &#x27;Phono&#x27; circuits, and Inayat Khan&#x27;s organiser in the Cinema network (later renamed Phono). Émile Henri Garry was later arrested and executed at Buchenwald in September 1944.

Renée Garry was allegedly paid 100,000 francs (some sources state 500 pounds). Her actions have been attributed at least partially to Garry&#x27;s suspicion that she had lost the affections of SOE agent France Antelme to Noor. After the war, she was tried but escaped conviction by one vote.

On or around 13 October 1943, Noor was arrested and interrogated at the SD Headquarters at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris. During that time, she attempted escape twice. Hans Kieffer, the former head of the SD in Paris, testified after the war that she did not give the Gestapo a single piece of information, but lied consistently.

However, other sources indicate that Noor chatted amiably with an out-of-uniform Alsatian interrogator, and provided personal details which enabled the SD to answer random checks in the form of questions about her childhood and family.

Noor did not talk about her activities under interrogation but the SD found her notebooks. Contrary to security regulations, Noor had copied out all the messages she had sent as an SOE operative (this may have been due to her misunderstanding what a reference to filing meant in her orders, and also the truncated nature of her security course due to the need to insert her into France as soon as possible). Although Noor refused to reveal any secret codes, the Germans gained enough information from them to continue sending false messages imitating her.

Some claim London failed to properly investigate anomalies which would have indicated the transmissions were sent under enemy control, in particular the change in the &#x27;fist&#x27; (the style of the operator&#x27;s Morse transmission). As a WAAF signaller, Noor had been nicknamed &quot;Bang Away Lulu&quot; because of her distinctively heavy-handed style, which was said to be a result of chilblains. However, according to M.R.D. Foot, the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) were quite adept at faking operators&#x27; fists. The well-organised and skillful counter-espionage work of the SD under Hans Josef Kieffer is, in fact, the true reason for the intelligence failures.

Additionally, Déricourt, F Section&#x27;s air-landing officer in France, literally gave SOE&#x27;s secrets to the SD in Paris. He would later claim to have been working for the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, commonly known as MI6), without the knowledge of SOE, as part of a complex deception plan in the run-up to D-Day.

As a result, however, three more agents sent to France were captured by the Germans at their parachute landing, including Madeleine Damerment, who was later executed. Sonya Olschanezky (&#x27;Tania&#x27;), a locally recruited SOE agent, had learnt of Noor&#x27;s arrest and sent a message to London through her fiancé, Jacques Weil, telling Baker Street of her capture and warning HQ to suspect any transmissions from &quot;Madeleine&quot;.

Colonel Maurice Buckmaster ignored the message as unreliable because he did not know who Olschanezky was. As a result, German transmissions from Noor&#x27;s radio continued to be treated as genuine, leading to the unnecessary deaths of SOE agents, including Olschanezky herself, who was executed at Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp on 6 July 1944. When Vera Atkins investigated the deaths of missing SOE agents, she initially confused Noor with Olschanezky (they were similar in appearance), who was unknown to her, believing Noor had been killed at Natzweiler, correcting the record only when she learned of Noor&#x27;s fate at Dachau.

On 25 November 1943, Noor escaped from the SD Headquarters, along with fellow SOE agent John Renshaw Starr and resistance leader Léon Faye, but was recaptured in the vicinity. There was an air raid alert as they escaped across the roof. Regulations required a count of prisoners at such times and their escape was discovered before they could get away. After refusing to sign a declaration renouncing future escape attempts, Noor was taken to Germany on 27 November 1943 &quot;for safe custody&quot; and imprisoned at Pforzheim in solitary confinement as a &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; (&quot;Night and Fog&quot;: condemned to &quot;Disappearance without Trace&quot;) prisoner, in complete secrecy. For ten months, she was kept there, shackled at her hands and feet.
Noor was classified as &quot;highly dangerous&quot; and shackled in chains most of the time. As the prison director testified after the war, Noor remained uncooperative and continued to refuse to give any information on her work or her fellow operatives, although in her despair at the appalling nature of her confinement, other prisoners could hear her crying at night. However, by scratching messages on the base of her mess cup, Noor was able to inform another inmate of her identity, giving the name of Nora Baker and the London address of her mother&#x27;s house.

==Execution==
On 12 September 1944, Noor Inayat Khan was abruptly transferred to the Dachau concentration camp along with her fellow agents Yolande Beekman, Madeleine Damerment and Eliane Plewman. At dawn on the following morning the four women were executed.

A Gestapo man named Max Wassmer was in charge of prisoner transports at Karlsruhe and accompanied the women to Dachau. Another Gestapo man named Christian Ott gave a statement to US investigators after the war as to the fate of Noor and her three companions. Ott was stationed at Karlsruhe and volunteered to accompany the four women to Dachau because he wanted to visit his family in Stuttgart on the return journey. Although he was not present at the execution, Ott told investigators what Wassmer had told him.

The four prisoners had come from the barrack in the camp, where they had spent the night, into the yard where the shooting was to take place. Here he [Wassmer] announced the death sentence to them. Only the Lagerkommandant and the two SS men were present. The German-speaking Englishwoman (the major) notified her companion about the death sentence. All four of the prisoners had grown very pale and wept; the major asked if they could protest against the sentence. The Kommandant declared that nobody could protest against the sentence. The major then requested to see a priest. The camp Kommandant denied the major&#x27;s request on the ground that there was no priest in the camp. Now the four prisoners were ordered to kneel with their heads facing a small mound of earth before they were killed by the two SS men, one after another by a shot through the back of the neck. During the shooting, the two Englishwomen held hands and the two Frenchwomen did the same. For three of the prisoners, the first shot caused their deaths, but for the German-speaking Englishwoman, a second shot needed to be fired because she still showed signs of life after the first shot was fired. After the shooting of these prisoners the Lagerkommandant said to the two SS men that he took a personal interest in the jewellery of the women and that this should be taken into his office.

This is an unreliable account because Ott told the investigator that he had asked Wassmer the following question after he was told what had happened to the women: &quot;But tell me, what really happened&quot;, to which Wassmer replied: &quot;So you want to know how it really happened?&quot;

In 1958, an anonymous Dutch prisoner asserted that Noor was cruelly beaten by an SS officer named Wilhelm Ruppert before she was shot from behind. Her last word was reported as &quot;Liberté&quot;. Noor was survived by her mother and three siblings.

==Honours and awards==

Noor Inayat Khan was posthumously awarded the George Cross in 1949. She was also awarded the French &quot;Croix de Guerre avec étoile de vermeil&quot; (&quot;with a silver-gilt star&quot;). Because she was still considered &quot;missing&quot; in 1946, she could not be awarded a Member of the Order of the British Empire, but her commission as Assistant Section Officer was gazetted in June (with effect from 5 July 1944), and she was Mentioned in Despatches in October 1946. Noor was the third of three Second World War FANY members to be awarded the George Cross, Britain&#x27;s highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy.

At the beginning of 2011, a campaign to raise £100,000 in order to pay for the construction of a bronze bust of her in central London close to her former home was launched. The unveiling of the bronze bust by the Princess Royal took place on 8 November 2012 in Gordon Square Gardens, Bloomsbury, London.

Noor was commemorated on a stamp which was issued by the Royal Mail on 25 March 2014 in a set of stamps about &quot;Remarkable Lives&quot;. In 2018, a campaign was launched to have Noor represented on the next version of the £50 note.

===George Cross citation===

The announcement of the award of the George Cross was made in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 5 April 1949. The full citation reads:The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the posthumous award of the GEORGE CROSS to:—
Assistant Section Officer Nora INAYAT-KHAN (9901), Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force.Assistant Section Officer Nora INAYAT-KHAN was the first woman operator to be infiltrated into enemy occupied France, and she was landed by Lysander aircraft on 16th June, 1943. During the weeks immediately following her arrival, the Gestapo made mass arrests in the Paris Resistance groups to which she had been detailed. However, she refused to abandon what had become the principal and most dangerous post in France, even though she had been given the opportunity to return to England, because she did not want to leave her French comrades without communications and she also hoped to rebuild her group. Therefore, she remained at her post and did the excellent work which earned her a posthumous Mention in Despatches.The Gestapo had a full description of her, but it only knew her code name &quot;Madeleine&quot;. It deployed considerable forces in its effort to catch her and break the last remaining link with London. After 3 months, she was betrayed to the Gestapo and taken to its H.Q. in the Avenue Foch. The Gestapo had found her codes and messages and as a result, it was now in a position to work back to London. It asked her to co-operate, but she refused and gave it no information of any kind. She was imprisoned in one of the cells on the 5th floor of the Gestapo H.Q. and she remained there for several weeks during which time she made two unsuccessful attempts to escape. She was asked to sign a declaration which stated that she would make no further escape attempts, but she refused to sign it and the Chief of the Gestapo obtained permission to send her to Germany for &quot;safe custody&quot; from Berlin. She was the first enemy agent to be sent to Germany.Assistant Section Officer INAYAT-KHAN was sent to Karlsruhe in November 1943, and then she was sent to Pforzheim where her cell was apart from the main prison. She was considered a particularly dangerous and uncooperative prisoner. The Director of the prison was also interrogated and confirmed that Assistant Section Officer INAYAT-KHAN refused to give any information whatsoever, either about her work or her colleagues when she was interrogated by the Karlsruhe Gestapo.She was taken to the Dachau Concentration Camp with three other female prisoners on 12 September 1944. On her arrival, she was taken to the crematorium and shot.Assistant Section Officer INAYAT-KHAN displayed the most conspicuous courage, both moral and physical over a period of more than 12 months.


===Blue plaque===

On 25 February 2019, it was announced Noor Inayat Khan would be honoured with a blue plaque at her wartime London home at 4 Taviton Street in Bloomsbury – the house she left on her final and fatal mission and the address she had etched into her bowl while in prison so she could be identified. Noor was the first woman of South Asian descent to have a blue plaque honouring her in London. The plaque was unveiled in a virtual ceremony broadcast on English Heritage&#x27;s Facebook page at 7 pm on Friday 28 August 2020.

==In popular culture==

===Theatre===
In 2022, Almanya Narula, a distinguished actor, writer, and fight choreographer, captivated audiences with her original one-woman solo show, &quot;Noor Inayat Khan: The Forgotten Spy&quot;, at the Hollywood Fringe Festival in Los Angeles, California. The performance depicted a poignant chapter in the life of Noor Inayat Khan, set against the backdrop of her imprisonment at 84 Avenue Foch. The show garnered widespread acclaim, with sold-out performances and accolades from both audiences and critics alike. It took home several awards including the &#x27;Soaring Solo Show Impact Award&#x27; and was nominated for &#x27;Best Solo Show&#x27; among others.

After its successful debut, &quot;Noor Inayat Khan: The Forgotten Spy&quot; embarked on a national tour in 2023, to full houses at the Whitefire Theatre in Sherman Oaks, CA, the historic Theatre Row Off-Broadway in New York City where it earned another &#x27;Best Actress&#x27; award for Almanya Narula, and in Chicago, hosted by the Sarah Siddons Society. The production&#x27;s acclaim was further amplified by coverage in major news outlets such as ABC7, NBC5, and the Chicago Reader.

In 2018 a play about the life and death of Khan, entitled &quot;Agent Madeleine&quot;, premiered at the Ottawa Fringe Festival. The role of Khan was played by Puja Uppal. The following deviations from facts have been noted:
* Khan is in a relationship with Leo Marks, instead of an unknown SOE officer.
* John Starr, Leon Faye, and a variety of prisoners of 84 Avenue Foch were represented by a single character, &quot;Marcel de Faye&quot;.
* Khan is imprisoned at 84 Avenue Foch until she is moved to Dachau, where she is executed alone.
* Khan&#x27;s escape attempts are altered – her escape out of the bathroom window is foiled by an air raid siren, and her escape attempt with the screwdriver is foiled when a guard discovers her with it.

Khan is the basis for Anna Sidiqui in Catalyst Theatre&#x27;s all-female musical &quot;The Invisible: Agents of Ungentlemanly Warfare. Book, music and lyrics&quot; by Jonathan Christenson.

Vera Atkins&#x27; search for the truth about Khan&#x27;s death is the subject of the 2022 play &quot;S.O.E.&quot; by Deborah Clair.

===Film===
In September 2012, producers Zafar Hai and Tabrez Noorani obtained the film rights to the biography &quot;Spy Princess: The Life of Noor Inayat Khan&quot; by Shrabani Basu.

Noor&#x27;s story is featured in the 2019 film &quot;A Call to Spy&quot;, written by Sarah Megan Thomas and directed by Lydia Dean Pilcher. Noor is played by Indian actress Radhika Apte.

Noor is the central character in the 2021 live action short film &quot;Liberté&quot;, written, produced and starring Sam Naz. The film was shot on location at Beaulieu Palace House where Noor had trained for SOE and features music from the track &quot;La Monotonia&quot; which was composed in Noor&#x27;s memory by her brother Hidayat Inayat Khan.

===Literature===
* On 6 September 2010, American poet Stacy Ericson posted a poem on the Internet entitled &quot;Resistance&quot;, dedicated to Noor Inayat Khan and providing a link back to Inayat Khan&#x27;s biography. This may have been the first poem dedicated to Noor Inayat Khan and refers to the isolation and fear shared by those in resistance to oppressive regimes.
* On 3 March 2013, Irfanulla Shariff, an American poet, posted a poem on the Internet, &quot;A Tribute To The Illuminated Woman of World War II&quot;, dedicated to Khan, which illustrates her life story.

===Television===

* The second episode of the Indian anthology series &quot;Adrishya&quot;, which aired on Epic TV in 2014, was based on Noor Inayat Khan&#x27;s wartime career, up to her death in Nazi Germany.
* &quot;A Man Called Intrepid&quot; (first airdate February 1979), a six-hour, fact-based TV miniseries broadcast in Canada on CTV and in the US on NBC, starred David Niven as its protagonist Sir William Stephenson, and Barbara Hershey as Noor. It contains a number of deviations from the facts.
* In 2014, PBS aired a 60-minute biographical docudrama entitled &quot;Enemy of the Reich: The Noor Inayat Khan Story&quot;, executive produced by Alex Kronemer and Michael Wolfe of Unity Productions Foundation and directed by Robert H. Gardner. Grace Srinivasan played the title role.
* In 2018, Netflix released an original series entitled &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Secret Agents: the new recruits&quot; Season Season 1, episode 4 featured a summary of Noor&#x27;s final mission with the SOE.
* On 5 January 2020, Aurora Marion played Noor in &quot;Spyfall, Part 2&quot;, the second episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, series 12.

===Radio===
In November 1980, as an afternoon theatre production, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a play about Noor written by Patrice Chaplin.

In November 1980, &quot;The Knightsbridge Memorial,&quot; a play about Noor, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 as a Saturday-Night Theatre production.

===Podcasts===
In 2024, Wondery produced a 5-part dramatised series on Noor&#x27;s life as part of &#x27;The Spy Who...&#x27; podcast.

===Music===
In December 2024, the ska band The Beat Assembly released a song entitled &quot;Oh Noor&quot;, that is a trubute to her bravery and courage.

<text>The National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, usually identified as the National Council of Churches (NCC), is the largest ecumenical body in the United States. NCC is an ecumenical partnership of 38 Christian faith groups in the United States. Its member communions include mainline Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, African-American, evangelical, and historic peace churches. Together, it encompasses more than 100,000 local congregations and 40 million adherents. It began as the Federal Council of Churches in 1908, and expanded through merger with several other ecumenical organizations to become the National Council of Churches in 1950. Its Interim President and General Secretary is Bishop Vashti Murphy McKenzie.

==History==

The first efforts at ecumenical organization emerged in May 1908 with the creation of the Federal Council of Churches (FCC). The FCC was created as a response to &quot;industrial problems&quot; that arose during the rapid industrialization of the United States. The primary concern was the protection of workers in a host of areas including wages, working conditions, child labor, and a six-day work week (reduced from seven).

During the next 40 plus years, FCC remained engaged in the domestic social problems of the day as well as international problems that threatened to draw the US into war. Its progressive social program along with support of conscientious objectors to World War II garnered stiff criticism from Christian fundamentalist circles. By 1950, numerous programs and efforts of social uplift had formed in addition to the FCC. Seeking greater unity, a dozen ecumenical bodies (including the FCC) gathered in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1950 to discuss how to more effectively organize their common work. Out of this meeting, via the merger of the Federal Council of Churches with several other ecumenical bodies, emerged the NCC.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s (it is unclear from the reference how long this continued), the National Council of Churches received some funding from the &quot;Foundation for Youth and Student Affairs&quot;, a front funded by the CIA to oppose communism.

==Membership==

The council&#x27;s 38 member communions include mainline Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, African-American, evangelical, and historic peace churches. Individual adherents of more than 50 Christian faith groups actively participate in NCC study groups, commissions, and ministries. Some of these participants belong to Christian faith groups such as the Catholic Church, fundamentalist groups, Southern Baptists, and Missouri Synod Lutherans, which are not officially a part of the council&#x27;s membership.

All NCC member organizations subscribe to the NCC&#x27;s statement of faith, which forms the preamble to the NCC&#x27;s charter:
==Social and political advocacy==

===The Social Creeds===

Since its founding in 1950, one of the primary activities of NCC has been to effect positive change for the betterment of society. Adopted in December 1908, &quot;The Social Creed of the Churches&quot; was a statement by members of the Federal Council of Churches against what it described as &quot;industrial problems&quot;. The document spelled out a list of principles, including:

*Equal rights and complete justice for all men in all stations of life
*Protection of the worker from dangerous machinery, occupational disease, injuries, and mortality
*Abolition of child labor
*Regulation of the conditions of toil for women as shall safeguard the physical and moral health of the community
*A living wage as a minimum in every industry
*Provision for the old age of the workers and for those incapacitated by injury
*Abatement of poverty

In 2007, the NCC updated its social creed to reflect a new era of globalization. The goal was to &quot;offer a vision of a society that shares more and consumes less, seeks compassion over suspicion and equality over domination, and finds security in joined hands rather than massed arms.&quot; In addition to those areas mentioned in the 1908 creed, the &quot;Social Creed for the 21st Century&quot; included additional principles, including:

*System of criminal rehabilitation based on restorative justice and end to the death penalty
*Limits on the power of private interests in politics
*Just immigration policies
*Sustainable use of earth&#x27;s resources
*Nuclear disarmament and redirection of military spending
*Religious dialogue
*Strengthening multilateral diplomacy, United Nations, and the rule of international law

These creeds have formed the basis, growing out of a common Christian faith, of the work of the NCC in public policy matters.

===The NCC in Washington===
For a number of years, the NCC maintained a separate policy advocacy office in Washington, D.C. Located in the United Methodist Building on Capitol Hill, the NCC Washington Office served as an ecumenical hub through which it could interact with the numerous denominational policy offices also located in the Methodist Building. Its work centered on areas mentioned in the creeds but also primarily focused around two programs, Eco-Justice and the Ecumenical Poverty Initiative. Both of these programs have been spun off into separate independent organizations since NCC restructuring in 2013.

NCC partners with dozens of other faith-based groups in DC and elsewhere, such as Bread for the World, Habitat for Humanity, and Children&#x27;s Defense Fund, to press for broad policy initiatives that address poverty issues. The council helped launch the Let Justice Roll grassroots anti-poverty campaign that has been successful in raising the minimum wage in more than 20 states since 2005.

In 2018, the council issued a statement opposing the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

===Civil rights movement===

NCC was closely aligned with leaders in the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Andrew Young. The NCC was an important link to mainline churches for the civil rights movement and it consistently condemned segregation during the Montgomery bus boycott and other actions. In a speech to NCC in 1957, King thanked the NCC for its support: &quot;This great body—the National Council of Churches—has condemned segregation over and over again, and has requested its constituent denominations to do likewise.&quot;

The NCC continued to be closely intertwined with the civil rights movement throughout the 1950s and 1960s. NCC created a Race Relations Sunday to educate and call to action mainline Christians nationwide. In 1961, Andrew Young left his position with the National Council of Churches to join the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, eventually becoming that organization&#x27;s executive director. When the Civil Rights Act was introduced in 1964, NCC lobbied heavily for its swift adoption. In January 1963, the NCC together with the Synagogue Council of America and the National Catholic Welfare Conference, convened the &quot;National Conference on Religion and Race,&quot; which issued &quot;An Appeal to the Conscience of the American People&quot; for a moral end to racism. From 1966 until 1973 Olivia P. Stokes was associate director of urban education in the NCC&#x27;s Department of Educational Development, developing the Black Curriculum Resource Center. W. Sterling Cary, the first Black president of the NCC who was elected in 1972, was a vocal advocate for racial justice and the Black Power movement.

===Vietnam War===

Since its inception, the NCC had been skeptical of the usefulness of war. During World War II, the Federal Council of Churches formed a Committee on Conscientious Objectors to advocate for the right of people of faith to refuse military service. During the Vietnam War, the NCC found itself in opposition to growing US military action. In 1965, the General Board stated that &quot;unilateral action by the United States in Southeast Asia will not lead to peace.&quot; The NCC&#x27;s position against the Vietnam War became increasingly strident in the 1960s and 1970s, and in some cases, alienated the laity of some member communions.

===Middle East peace===

NCC has been a consistent supporter of a negotiated solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In partnership with the World Council of Churches, it has traditionally sought to balance its approach, seeking safety and protection for both the Jewish and Palestinian communities. It has focused on meeting needs of the victims of this conflict in all communities and supporting continued negotiations. Since the late 1960s the NCC has taken positions sympathetic towards Palestinian land rights and supportive of a secure Israel.

More recently, NCC has been particularly concerned with the plight of Christian communities in the region. Some of NCC&#x27;s member communions have congregations or partners in the region that are being directly affected. However, the NCC&#x27;s &quot;witness to the need for vigilance in brokering peace extends to our concern for all people in the region, whether they be Christians, Jews, Muslims, Baháʼís or others, and whether they be Israelis, Palestinians, Syrians, Egyptians, or others.&quot;

===Poverty===

The council has supported many poverty alleviation efforts, including increases to the minimum wage and ecumenical efforts such as the Circle of Protection and the Faithful Budget Campaign. In 2013, during restructuring, NCC spun off its department dealing with poverty issues into a new organization, the Ecumenical Poverty Initiative. NCC continues its work on poverty through its support of EPI as well as partnerships with other likeminded organizations.

===Environment===

During the oil crisis of the 1970s, NCC issued a statement in which it called for &quot;Ecological Justice&quot;. The statement called for more work on renewable energy, reductions in energy sources that pollute, and support for energy sources that did not have adverse effects on communities (health, economic, etc.). This statement helped form the basis for the creation of the NCC&#x27;s Eco-Justice program. Housed in the NCC Washington Office, the program focused on federal environmental policy. In 2013, the Eco-Justice program was spun off into its own organization, Creation Justice Ministries. CJM continues to work with NCC and its 38 member communions to coordinate efforts to protect the environment.

===Mass incarceration===
Over the past three years, NCC has taken a more active role in the struggle against mass incarceration. As early as 1979, NCC recognized the problem of a justice system based on retribution and the over-representation of communities of color in the prison population. More recently, NCC has worked for sentencing reform to reduce mandatory minimum sentences, advocated for clemency for individuals who were over sentenced, and prison conditions. In addition, NCC has also broadened this work to include police reform, especially in the wake of much publicized shootings in places such as Baton Rouge, Minneapolis, and Dallas.

==Publishing and research==
The NCC fostered the multi-denominational research effort that produced the Revised Standard Version and the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible, and holds the copyrights to both translations.

The NCC sponsors the research program on which the &quot;Uniform Sunday School Lesson Series&quot; is based. The series began in 1872 under the auspices of the National Sunday School Convention.

The NCC also published until 2012 the annual &quot;Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches&quot;, since 1916 a widely used reference work on trends, statistics and programmatic information on religious organizations in North America. Future editions of the yearbook will be published by the Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies (ASARB).

==Theological and ecumenical dialogue==
The NCC is a member of the interdenominational World Council of Churches and, through the WCC, is in communication with denominations of numerous theological stances. They have released several joint statements over the years. Rev. Dr. Angelique Walker Smith of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., a member church of the NCC, is the WCC&#x27;s president from North America.

The NCC Faith and Order Commission is an ongoing, scholarly, ecumenical dialogue among North American Christian theologians and ecclesiastical historians, including evangelical, Pentecostal, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, mainline Protestant, and African-American scholars. In 2007, the commission celebrated its fiftieth anniversary.

== Interfaith dialogue ==
Through the &quot;Interreligious Relations Convening Table&quot;, the NCC is in dialogue with representatives of Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism.

Since 2004, the NCC aided in forming the &quot;National Muslim-Christian Dialogue&quot; with the Islamic Circle of North America, and the United States Council of Muslim Organizations. In addition to theological discussions, the dialogue has focused on social issues including Islamophobia in the United States. Since 2010, there has been an annual dialogue between the participants. In 2015 the interfaith dialogue participants came to 16 theological points of agreement between Christianity and Islam.

The NCC is in dialogue with the National Council of Synagogues, a partnership of Reformed, Conservative, and the Reconstructionist groups in Judaism for the purpose of interfaith affairs. The main focus of discussion between the NCC and NCS is pastoral affairs and community issues such as antisemitism. Their most recent meeting was in December of 2023. Orthodox Judaism is presently not in dialogue with the NCC.

Concerning their dialogue with Hinduism, the NCC established the &quot;National Hindu-Christian Dialogue&quot; in 2018. Through this dialogue, they are in discussions with the Vedanta Society of Southern California which is under the spiritual leadership of the Ramakrishna Order.

They also established the &quot;National Buddhist-Christian Dialogue&quot; in 2018 for discussions with those of the Buddhist faith. In addition to the NCC, participants include the Guibord Center, Fo Guang Shan Hsi Lai Temple, Claremont School of Theology, and the University of the West. Presently the dialogue is focused on bilateral understanding of the two faiths.

The &quot;National Sikh-Christian Dialogue&quot; was started by the NCC in 2019 and is in communication with the Sikh Council of Interfaith Relations. Recent discussions include understanding the history of persecution which impacted both faiths.

==Facilities==
The council was the original anchor tenant in the 19-story Interchurch Center built in 1952 adjacent to Columbia University, Union Theological Seminary, and the Riverside Church in New York City. It vacated these premises in 2013 when it consolidated its offices in the building long used by its public-policy staff at 110 Maryland Avenue, NE, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="382267" wikidata="Q5584023" url="?curid=382267" title="William Lisle Bowles">
<text>William Lisle Bowles (24 September 17627 April 1850) was an English priest, poet and critic.

==Life and career==
Bowles was born at King&#x27;s Sutton, Northamptonshire, where his father was vicar. At the age of 14 he entered Winchester College, where the headmaster at the time was Dr Joseph Warton. In 1781 Bowles left as captain of the school, and went on to Trinity College, Oxford, where he had won a scholarship. Two years later he won the Chancellor&#x27;s prize for Latin verse.

Bowles came from a line of Church of England clergymen. His great-grandfather Matthew Bowles (1652–1742), grandfather Dr Thomas Bowles (1696–1773) and father William Thomas Bowles (1728–1786) had all been parish priests. After taking his degree at Oxford, Bowles followed his forebears into the Church of England, and in 1792, after serving as curate in Donhead St Andrew, was appointed vicar of Chicklade in Wiltshire. In 1797 he received the vicarage of Dumbleton in Gloucestershire, and in 1804 became vicar of Bremhill in Wiltshire, where he wrote the poem seen on Maud Heath&#x27;s statue. In the same year his bishop, John Douglas, collated him to a prebendal stall in Salisbury Cathedral. In 1818 he was made chaplain to the Prince Regent, and in 1828 he was elected residentiary canon of Salisbury.

==Works==
In 1789 he published, in a very small quarto volume, &quot;Fourteen Sonnets&quot;, which were received with extraordinary favour, not only by the general public, but by such men as Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth. Coleridge credited him, alongside Charlotte Smith, with bringing about a general revival of the sonnet form in their generation.

The &quot;Sonnets&quot; even in form were a revival, a return to an older and purer poetic style, and by their grace of expression, melodious versification, tender tone of feeling and vivid appreciation of the life and beauty of nature, stood out in strong contrast to the elaborated commonplaces which at that time formed the bulk of English poetry. Bowles said thereof &quot;Poetic trifles from solitary rambles whilst chewing the cud of sweet and bitter fancy, written from memory, confined to fourteen lines, this seemed best adapted to the unity of sentiment, the verse flowed in unpremeditated harmony as my ear directed but are far from being mere elegiac couplets&quot;.

The longer poems published by Bowles are not of a very high standard, though all are distinguished by purity of imagination, cultured and graceful diction, and great tenderness of feeling. The most extensive were &quot;The Spirit of Discovery&quot; (1804), which was mercilessly ridiculed by Lord Byron; &quot;The Missionary&quot; (1813); &quot;The Grave of the Last Saxon&quot; (1822); and &quot;St John in Patmos&quot; (1833). Bowles is perhaps more celebrated as a critic than as a poet. In 1806 he published an edition of Alexander Pope&#x27;s works with notes and an essay, in which he laid down certain canons as to poetic imagery which, subject to some modification, were later accepted, but which were received at the time with strong opposition by admirers of Pope and his style. He restated his views in 1819, in &quot;The Invariable Principles of Poetry&quot;. The controversy brought into sharp contrast the opposing views of poetry, which may be roughly described as the natural and the artificial.

Bowles was an amiable, absent-minded, and rather eccentric man. His poems are characterised by refinement of feeling, tenderness, and pensive thought, but are deficient in power and passion. Bowles maintained that images drawn from nature are poetically finer than those drawn from art; and that in the highest kinds of poetry the themes or passions handled should be of the general or elemental kind, and not the transient manners of any society. These positions were attacked by Byron, Thomas Campbell, William Roscoe and others, while for a time Bowles was almost solitary. William Hazlitt and the &quot;Blackwood&quot; critics came to his assistance, and on the whole Bowles had reason to congratulate himself on having established certain principles which might serve as the basis of a true method of poetical criticism, and of having inaugurated, both by precept and by example, a new era in English poetry. Among other prose works from his prolific pen was a &quot;Life of Bishop Ken&quot; (two volumes, 1830–1831). Other works include &quot;Coombe Ellen and St. Michael&#x27;s Mount&quot; (1798), &quot;The Battle of the Nile&quot; (1799), and &quot;The Sorrows of Switzerland&quot; (1801).

Bowles also enjoyed considerable reputation as an antiquary, his principal work in that department being &quot;Hermes Britannicus&quot; (1828). His &quot;Poetical Works&quot; were collected in 1855 as part of the Library Edition of the British Poets, with a memoir by George Gilfillan.

==Reception==
Bowles&#x27; work was important to the young Samuel Taylor Coleridge:
Subsequently however, in an important letter of 1802, Coleridge took exception to Bowles&#x27;s persistent drawing of parallels between a natural scene and human life &quot;in the shape of formal similes&quot;, arguing instead for a &quot;merger&quot; of the poet&#x27;s mind with &quot;the great appearances of nature&quot;. Bowles was the cause in the 1820s of the Alexander Pope controversy into which Lord Byron was drawn.

<text>Westminster Pier is a pier on the River Thames, in the City of Westminster in London, England. It is operated by Uber Boat by Thames Clippers and served by various river transport and cruise operators. It is located next to Westminster Bridge on the north bank of the Thames, and is close to one of London&#x27;s most prominent landmarks, Big Ben.

==Former Westminster Floating Pier==
The former Westminster Floating Pier existed on the site through the 1950s, running along the Thames between Kew and the London docks. The floating pier acted as a landing point for many Royal water journeys, including the conclusion of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Commonwealth tour in May 1954.

On the 7th February 1955, night watchmen reported a leak had been found in the pier, causing the middle sections to sink. Workman from the Port Of London Authority spent three hours trying to drain the central pontoon of water, with the pier being half submerged by 10am before fully sinking &quot;as Big Ben stuck twelve&quot;. No one was hurt during the sinking, with the staff having time to evacuate and retrieve important documents.
The sinking of the pier was widely reported on by newspapers and media of the time, with it being parodied in an episode of &quot;The Goon Show&quot; a week after the incident.

==Construction==

The development of Westminster Millennium Pier was funded by the Millennium Commission as part of the Thames project, and it was one of five new piers opened in 2000 by the Commission on the Thames (the others being Blackfriars Millennium Pier, London Eye Pier, Tower Millennium Pier and Millbank Millennium Pier). Its creation was funded by the project as part of an integrated transport and regeneration strategy for the Thames led by London&#x27;s Cross River Partnership.

==Services==
The pier is served by various services including:
* Thames River Services between Westminster, Tower Bridge Quay, Greenwich Pier and the Thames Flood Barrier (Pre-booked groups can disembark at Barrier Gardens Pier).
* City Cruises leisure cruises between Westminster and Greenwich Pier
* Circular Cruise Westminster to St Katharine&#x27;s Circular
* Thames River Boats cruises to Hampton Court Palace

<doc id="382271" wikidata="Q424156" url="?curid=382271" title="Tadalafil">
<text>Tadalafil, sold under the brand name Cialis among others, is a medication used to treat erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is taken by mouth. Onset is typically within half an hour and the duration is up to 36 hours.
Common side effects include headache, muscle pain, flushed skin, and nausea. Caution is advised in those with cardiovascular disease. Rare but serious side effects include a prolonged erection that can lead to damage to the penis, vision problems, and hearing loss. Tadalafil is not recommended in people taking nitrovasodilators such as nitroglycerin, as this may result in a serious drop in blood pressure. Tadalafil is a PDE5 inhibitor which increases blood flow to the penis. It also dilates blood vessels in the lungs, which lowers the pulmonary artery pressure.
Tadalafil was approved for medical use in the United States in 2003. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 172nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

Tadalafil is used to treat erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the US, tadalafil (as Cialis) is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia; and (as Adcirca) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension to improve exercise ability.

===Benign prostatic hyperplasia===
A meta‐analysis found that tadalafil is an effective treatment for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia and that such treatment had a low rate of adverse effects. Tadalafil is FDA-approved for males as a therapy to treat and prevent symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, such as urinary urgency, hesitancy, weak stream, dribbling, and incontinence. Tadalafil was found to have similar benefits for lower urinary tract symptoms as the usually prescribed tamsulosin.

===Pulmonary arterial hypertension===
Tadalafil is approved in the United States, Canada, and Japan to improve exercise ability in people with pulmonary arterial hypertension.

==Adverse effects==
The most common potential side effects when using tadalafil are headache, stomach discomfort or pain, indigestion, burping, acid reflux, back pain, myalgia (pain in limbs and extremities), flushing, hypertension (or uncommonly hypotension), and stuffy/runny nose. Also common are dizziness, peripheral edema, fatigue, and urinary or respiratory tract infection; both diarrhea and constipation have been reported. Diarrhea was reported more frequently in patients 65 or older than in younger subjects. These side effects reflect the ability of PDE5 inhibition to cause vasodilation (causing blood vessels to widen) and usually resolve after a few hours.

===Vision===
In May 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that tadalafil (along with other PDE5 inhibitors) was associated with vision impairment related to NAION (non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy). Most, but not all, of these patients, had underlying anatomic or vascular risk factors for the development of NAION, unrelated to PDE5 inhibitor use. The FDA concluded that they were not able to draw a cause and effect relationship, only an association; the label of all three PDE5 inhibitors was changed to alert clinicians to that fact. A 2019 meta-analysis found that tadalafil exposure was &quot;not&quot; associated with NAION.

===Hearing===
In October 2007, the FDA announced that the labeling for all PDE5 inhibitors, including tadalafil, requires a more prominent warning of the potential risk of sudden hearing loss as the result of post-marketing reports of temporary deafness associated with use of PDE5 inhibitors.

==Metabolism==
Tadalafil is metabolized predominantly by the liver CYP3A4 enzyme system.

==Mechanism of action==
Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (more commonly known as cyclic GMP or cGMP) in smooth muscle cells. cGMP relaxes smooth muscle and increases blood flow to the corpus cavernosum.

The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Tadalafil (and sildenafil and vardenafil) inhibits PDE5. However, because sexual stimulation is required to initiate the local penile release of nitric oxide, tadalafil&#x27;s inhibition of PDE5 will have no effect without sexual stimulation.

===Duration of action===

Although sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil all work by inhibiting PDE5, tadalafil&#x27;s pharmacologic distinction is its longer half-life (17.5 hours), compared to sildenafil and vardenafil, which are both 4–5 hours. This translates to a longer duration of action, which is partly responsible for &quot;The Weekend Pill&quot; nickname. Furthermore, the longer half-life is the basis for tadalafil&#x27;s daily therapeutic use in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension.

===Comparison with actions of other PDE5 inhibitors===
Sildenafil and vardenafil inhibit PDE6, an enzyme found in the eye, more than tadalafil. Some sildenafil users see a bluish tinge and have a heightened sensitivity to light because of PDE6 inhibition.

Sildenafil and vardenafil also inhibit PDE1 more than tadalafil. PDE1 is found in the brain, heart, and vascular smooth muscle. It is thought that the inhibition of PDE1 by sildenafil and vardenafil leads to vasodilation, flushing, and tachycardia.

Tadalafil inhibits PDE11 more than sildenafil or vardenafil. PDE11 is expressed in skeletal muscle, the prostate, the liver, the kidney, the pituitary gland, and the testes. The effects on the body of inhibiting PDE11 are not known.

==Chemistry==
Tadalafil is an annulated 2,5-diketopiperazine. It is also a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline.

Tadalafil can be synthesized starting from (D)-tryptophan methyl ester and piperonal via a Pictet–Spengler reaction. This is followed by condensations with chloroacetyl chloride and methylamine to complete the diketopiperazine ring:

==History==
The FDA&#x27;s approval of sildenafil in 1998 was a ground-breaking commercial event for the treatment of ED, with sales exceeding US$1 billion. Subsequently, the FDA approved both vardenafil and tadalafil in 2003.

It initially was developed by the biotechnology company ICOS, and then again developed and marketed worldwide by Lilly ICOS, LLC, the joint venture of ICOS Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company. Tadalafil was approved in 2009 in the United States for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and is under regulatory review in other regions for this condition. In late November 2008, Eli Lilly sold the exclusive rights to commercialize tadalafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension in the United States to United Therapeutics for an upfront payment of $150 million.

Tadalafil was discovered by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) under a partnership between Glaxo and ICOS to develop new drugs that began in August 1991. In 1993, the Bothell, Washington, biotechnology company ICOS Corporation began studying compound IC351, a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) enzyme inhibitor. In 1994, Pfizer scientists discovered that sildenafil, which also inhibits the PDE5 enzyme, caused penile erection in males participating in a clinical study of a heart medicine. Although ICOS scientists were not testing compound IC351 for treating ED, they recognized its potential usefulness for treating that disorder. Soon, in 1994, ICOS received a patent for compound IC351 (structurally unlike sildenafil and vardenafil), and Phase 1 clinical trials began in 1995. In 1997, the Phase 2 clinical studies were initiated for males experiencing ED, then progressed to the Phase 3 trials that supported the drug&#x27;s FDA approval. Although Glaxo had an agreement with ICOS to share profits 50/50 for drugs resulting from the partnership, Glaxo let the agreement lapse in 1996 as the drugs developed were not in the company&#x27;s core markets.
In 1998, ICOS Corporation and Eli Lilly and Company formed the Lilly ICOS, LLC, a joint venture company to further develop and commercialize tadalafil as a treatment for ED. Two years later, Lilly ICOS, LLC, filed a new drug application with the FDA for compound IC351 (under the tadalafil generic name, and the Cialis brand name). In May 2002, Lilly ICOS reported to the American Urological Association that clinical trial testing demonstrated that tadalafil was effective for up to 36 hours, and one year later, the FDA approved tadalafil. One advantage Cialis has over Viagra and Levitra is its 17.5-hour half-life (thus Cialis is advertised to work for up to 36 hours, after which time there remains approximately 25% of the absorbed dose in the body) when compared to the four-hour half-life of sildenafil (Viagra).

In 2007, Eli Lilly and Company bought the ICOS Corporation for $2.3 billion. As a result, Eli Lilly owned Cialis and then closed the ICOS operations, ending the joint venture and firing most of ICOS&#x27;s approximately 500 employees, except for 127 employees of the ICOS biologics facility, which subsequently was bought by CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC).

Persons surnamed &quot;Cialis&quot; objected to Eli Lilly and Company&#x27;s so naming the drug, but the company has maintained that the drug&#x27;s trade name is unrelated to the surname.

In October 2011, the US FDA approved tadalafil to treat the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a condition in which the prostate gland becomes enlarged, obstructing the free flow of urine. Symptoms may include sudden urges to urinate (urgency), difficulty in starting urination (hesitancy), a weak urine stream, and more frequent urination — especially at night. The FDA has also approved tadalafil for the treatment of both benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction where the two conditions co-exist.

==Society and culture==
===Marketing===
In the United States, the FDA relaxed rules on prescription drug marketing in 1997, allowing advertisements targeted directly to consumers. Lilly-ICOS hired the Grey Worldwide Agency in New York, part of the Grey Global Group, to run the Cialis advertising campaign. Marketing for Cialis has taken advantage of its greater duration compared to its competitors in advertisements for the drug; Stuart Elliot of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined: &quot;The continuous presence of females in Cialis ads is a subtle signal that the drug makes it easier for them to set the pace with males, in contrast to the primarily male-driven imagery for Levitra and Viagra.&quot; Iconic themes in Cialis ads include couples side by side in matching bathtubs and the slogan &quot;When the moment is right, will you be ready?&quot; Cialis ads were unique among the ED drugs in mentioning specifics of the drug. As a result, Cialis ads were also the first to describe the side effects in an advertisement, as the FDA requires advertisements with specifics to mention side effects. One of the first Cialis ads aired at the 2004 Super Bowl. Just weeks before the Super Bowl, the FDA required more possible side effects to be listed in the advertisement, including priapism. Although many parents objected to the Cialis ad being aired during the Super Bowl, Janet Jackson&#x27;s halftime &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot; overshadowed Cialis. In January 2006, the Cialis ads were tweaked, adding a doctor on screen to describe side effects and only running ads where more than 90 percent of the audience are adults, effectively ending Super Bowl ads. In 2004, Lilly-ICOS, Pfizer, and GlaxoSmithKline spent a combined $373.1 million to advertise Cialis, Viagra, and Levitra respectively. Cialis has sponsored many sporting events, including the America&#x27;s Cup and the PGA Tour, once being title sponsor of the PGA Tour Western Open tournament.

=== Economics ===
In Australia, tadalafil is subsidized through the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) for patients with a specific accepted war- or service-related disability.

In the US, a generic version of tadalafil is available. While some health insurance providers cover at least part of the cost (typically limiting the number of doses covered per month), many providers, including those operating under Medicare Part D, do not cover the cost of medications prescribed for erectile dysfunction.

In the UK, a generic version of tadalafil became available in November 2017, reducing its price per pill, and is available through the NHS. In China, CMOAPI is the largest manufacturer of Tadalafil powder.

== Research ==
Tadalafil is being studied for treating Peyronie&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="382273" wikidata="Q2442357" url="?curid=382273" title="Thomas Aird">
<text>Thomas Aird (28 August 180225 April 1876) was a Scottish poet, best known for his 1830 narrative poem &quot;The Captive of Fez&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Aird was born in 1802 at Bowden, Roxburghshire. His parents were James Aird, a builder, and Isabella née Paisley. After completing his education at the local parish school, Aird studied for an undergraduate degree at the University of Edinburgh. While at University, Aird met many writers, including John Wilson and James Hogg.

==Writing career==
After graduation, Aird resisted encouragements to become a Church of Scotland minister, instead remaining in Edinburgh to devote himself to writing. His publication debut came in 1826, with &quot;Martzoufle: a Tragedy in Three Acts, with other Poems&quot;, although this collection was largely overlooked by critics. In the early years of his career, he also contributed articles to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, wrote a series of essays entitled &quot;Religious Characteristics&quot;, and published &quot;The Captive of Fez&quot;, a narrative poem, in 1830.

Between 1832 and 1833, Aird acted as the editor of the &quot;Edinburgh Weekly Journal&quot;, succeeding James Ballantyne. From 1835, he was the editor of the &quot;Dumfriesshire and Galloway Herald&quot;, a post he continued to hold for 28 years. While editor, several of his poems were published in the &quot;Herald&quot;.

In 1848, he published a collection of his poetry, which was very well received. His last main literary work was editing an edition of the works of David Macbeth Moir in 1852. In 1863, he retired from editorship of the &quot;Herald&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Aird&#x27;s friends included De Quincey, Lockhart, Stanley (afterwards dean of Westminster) and Motherwell.

Aird died in 1876 in Castlebank, Dumfries, and was buried at St Michael&#x27;s Church.

<doc id="382274" wikidata="Q797527" url="?curid=382274" title="British Togoland">
<text>British Togoland, officially the Mandate Territory of Togoland and later officially the Trust Territory of Togoland, was a territory in West Africa under the administration of the United Kingdom, which subsequently entered a union with Ghana, part of which became its Volta Region. The territory was effectively formed in 1916 by the splitting of the German protectorate of Togoland into two territories, French Togoland and British Togoland, during the First World War. Initially, it was a League of Nations Class B mandate. In 1922, British Togoland was formally placed under British rule, and French Togoland, now Togo, was placed under French rule.

After the Second World War, the political status of British Togoland changed. It became a United Nations Trust Territory but was still administered by the United Kingdom. During the decolonization of Africa, a status plebiscite was organised in British Togoland in May 1956 to decide the future of the territory; 58% of the voters taking part voted to merge the territory with the neighbouring British Crown colony of the Gold Coast, which was heading towards independence, rather than remain a trusteeship and await developments in French Togoland. On 13 December 1956, the United Nations General Assembly passed General Assembly resolution 1044 on &quot;The future of Togoland under British administration&quot;. By that resolution, the UN acknowledged the outcome of the plebiscite held in the territory with a majority in favour of union with the Gold Coast. The resolution recommended that the United Kingdom effect the union of British Togoland with Gold Coast upon the independence of Gold Coast. To achieve that, the Ghana Independence Act 1957 had the United Kingdom annex British Togoland to form part of Her Majesty&#x27;s dominions comprising the Dominion of Ghana.

In a letter dated 6 March 1957, the British government informed the Secretary-General of the United Nations that with effect from midnight 6 March 1957, under the terms of the Ghana Independence Act 1957, the territories that had comprised in the Gold Coast became the independent State of Ghana and that under the same Act, the union of the former Trust Territory of Togoland under British administration with the independent State of Ghana took place from the same time and date.

British Togoland&#x27;s capital was Ho, which now serves as the capital of Volta Region. The region includes much of the former mandate&#x27;s territory.

== United Nations trust territory ==
After World War II, the mandate became a United Nations trust territory administered by the United Kingdom. Prior to the mandate and trusteeship periods, British Togoland was administered as part of the adjoining territory of the Gold Coast, under the name of &quot;Trans-Volta Togo&quot; (TVT).

=== Togoland Congress ===
In 1954, the British government informed the UN that it would be unable to administer the Trust Territory after 1957. In response, in December 1955, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution advising the British government to hold a plebiscite on the future of British Togoland.

On 9 May 1956, this plebiscite was held under UN supervision with the choice between formal integration with the future independent Gold Coast or continuation as a Trust Territory.

The Togoland Congress campaigned against integration. There was vocal opposition to the incorporation of Togoland from the Ewe people who voted against in British Togoland, as the Ewe wanted the unification of the Ewe people in British Togoland and French Togoland as a separate Ewe state (modern Togo).

It was reported that the vote results was 42% against from the Ewe people (Togoland Congress), and 58% for integration.

<doc id="382276" wikidata="Q4020110" url="?curid=382276" title="William Motherwell">
<text>William Motherwell (13 October 1797, Glasgow – 1 November 1835, Glasgow) was a Scottish poet, antiquary and journalist.

==Life==
Motherwell was born in Glasgow, the son of Willan and Jane Motherwell. His father was an ironmonger. He was sent to school and at the age of fifteen he was apprenticed in the office of the sheriff-clerk at Paisley. He studied classics for a winter term at Glasgow University between 1818 and 1819. He and appointed sheriff-clerk depute there in 1819. He spent his leisure in collecting materials for a volume of local ballads which he published in 1819 under the title of &quot;The Harp of Renfrewshire&quot;. In 1827 he published a further instalment in &quot;Minstrelsy Ancient and Modern&quot;, prefaced by an excellent historical introduction. This work was to provide evidence of the work of notable women like Agnes Lyle. He contributed verses to newspapers and magazines, &quot;Jeanie Morrison&quot;, &quot;My Heid is like to rend, Willie&quot;, and &quot;Wearies Cauld Well&quot; being his best-known poems. He became editor of the &quot;Paisley Advertiser&quot; in 1828, and of the &quot;Glasgow Courier&quot; in 1830. He was the publisher of the short-lived daily literary paper &quot;The Day&quot; from January to June 1832.

A small volume of his poems was published in 1832, and a larger volume with a memoir in 1846, reissued, with additions, in 1848.

William Motherwell did not know Robert Tannahill, but became very well acquainted with Tannahill&#x27;s friend and musical collaborator Robert Archibald Smith. It has been suggested that Smith may have encouraged Tannahill&#x27;s shift from weaving to music, but this has no basis in fact as no such shift ever took place. Tannahill was a weaver from the time he was apprenticed to his father on 7 December 1786 until his death in 1810. It was Smith who sought out the company of Tannahill after hearing one of latter&#x27;s songs performed at a musical evening in Paisley.

In his role as Sheriff-Clerk Depute, William Motherwell was not averse to &quot;handling a truncheon in defence of the public peace on the streets of Paisley&quot;. Motherwell has been described in classic twentieth century parlance as the &quot;working class Tory made good&quot;. He managed through his own efforts to establish himself in moderately powerful circles and become something of an arbiter of both literary and political opinion during the 1820s. In politics he was an Orangeman as well as a Tory. Orangeism espousing the view that hereditary rank is sacred while Roman Catholicism and revolutionary innovations which threaten the constitution (unwritten) of Britain are an abhorrence.

Motherwell left Paisley for Glasgow in 1830 to become the Tory editor of the Orange-Tory paper the &quot;Glasgow Courier&quot;. While Motherwell expressed a kind of cultural nationalism in his literary work, his politics were well to right, nowhere near the liberation theology of George Buchanan with his abstract democratic principles but violently opposed to anything Roman Catholic. Motherwell is not atypical of the Glasgow middle classes of his time. By reason of common sense he could not deny that he lived in Scotland and if one was honest about history that history was for the most part Scottish. Complex as that history might be there was a need to come up with a coherent story. A need for propaganda and opinion forming. The modern state had well and truly arrived. And if the social conflict and deprivation in Glasgow were anything to go by it was a state closer to hell than to heaven.

What Motherwell had was a romantic hankering for the chivalrous which took form in his participation in the rituals and ideology of Orangeism; in the activities of collecting antique songs and poems as well as more conventional antique objects. Motherwell understood the need, all too human, to make a coherent story in the history of literature or of politics that answered peoples&#x27; personal and psychological yearnings. The natural inclination to make the world make sense and give life meaning; and that he understood this is perhaps to his credit.

Orangeism was a new Irish variant of the Presbyterianism which had existed in Scotland since the Reformation of 1560. The mythologising of 1690 and William III in Scotland had everything to do with the Tory politics of the early 19th Century and their (the Tories) determination to win the class war. To oppose calls for universal suffrage. To deny the injustice done to Thomas Muir and the Friends of the People, to discredit the writings of Thomas Paine. (In Motherwell&#x27;s time and from his viewpoint this version of the story, of history, made perfect sense). The Orange Lodge in Scotland were a form of Protestant ideological storm-troopers. The hard-line. The fiery preachers who made Tories of working women and men.

The values of Orangeism are on the face of it quite deeply at odds with Motherwell&#x27;s cultural activities. He was for the preservation and use of the Scots language in literature something that militates against the inherent Britishness of Orange ideology. M&#x27;Conechy in his memoir of Motherwell states that the introduction of Orangeism in Scotland &quot;could be attended with no benefits whatsoever… As an antagonist to Popery and Jacobitism it was certainly not wanted in Presbyterian Scotland&quot;. That the Orange Lodge still thrives throughout much of Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, Ayrshire and elsewhere today implies that M&#x27;Conechy is being somewhat disingenuous in his assessment of the real role of Orangeism. While M&#x27;Conechy may have come from a part of the Tory party which did not approve of the Orangemen there were plenty of other Tories who did. Motherwell&#x27;s dalliance with Orangeism (and M&#x27;Conechy&#x27;s denial), in apparent contradiction to his cultural politics, can be seen as an example of the kind of personal identity crisis that arose frequently in Scots men and woman following the Act of Union. Yet through this William Motherwell carried out useful literary and cultural work, simply by the act of writing down and recording. 
The Harp of Renfrewshire is an important book. Although it was already in progress when it landed with Motherwell his introductory essay is not without merit. It seeks to understand a locale and its history through the study of the poetry and song of the place itself. It includes folk pretty much on the basis of literary merit and not along sectarian or class divides. He shows an understanding of literature as both historical process and individual creative process; demonstrates that language is not static but evolves and that political forces have influence on such evolution. So there is a fairly sophisticated level of literary/cultural politics and argument going on there.

In spite of his Paisley Sheriff&#x27;s Depute job bringing him &quot;into the thick of military suppression of the Radical risings and civil disturbances around 1820; in 1818 he was knocked unconscious by an angry crowd and narrowly escaped being thrown in the River Cart.&quot; he was extremely sympathetic towards both Tannahill and the radical poet Alexander Wilson in his introduction to &quot;The Harp of Renfrewshire&quot;. As a result, he further enhanced the reputations of both Tannahill and Alexander Wilson.

==Grave==

Motherwell is buried in the Glasgow Necropolis. The grave was originally unmarked but in 1851 a monument carved by the celebrated Scots sculptor James Fillans was erected by admirers.

==Artistic recognition==

He was sculpted by James Fillans.

<text>Michael Ellis DeBakey (September 7, 1908 – July 11, 2008) was an American general and cardiovascular surgeon, scientist and medical educator who became Chairman of the Department of Surgery, President, and Chancellor of Baylor College of Medicine at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, Texas. His career spanned nearly eight decades.

Born to Lebanese immigrants, DeBakey was inspired to pursue a career in medicine by the physicians that he had met at his father&#x27;s drug store, and he simultaneously learned sewing skills from his mother. He subsequently attended Tulane University for his premedical course and Tulane University School of Medicine to study medicine. At Tulane, he developed a version of the roller pump, which he initially used to transfuse blood directly from person to person and which later became a component of the heart–lung machine. Following early surgical training at Charity Hospital, DeBakey was encouraged to complete his surgical fellowships in Europe, before returning to Tulane University in 1937. During World War II, he worked in the Surgical Consultants Division of the Office of the Army Surgeon General, and later was involved in the establishment of the Veterans Administration.

DeBakey&#x27;s surgical innovations included novel procedures to repair aortic aneurysms and dissections, the development of ventricular assist devices, and the introduction of prosthetic vascular substitutes. DeBakey received a number of awards, including the Albert Lasker Award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the National Medal of Science, and the Congressional Gold Medal. In addition, a number of institutions bear his name.

==Early life and education==
Michael DeBakey was born Michel Dabaghi () on September 7, 1908 in Lake Charles, Louisiana. His parents, Shiker and Raheeja Dabaghi (which was anglicized to DeBakey) were immigrants from Marjeyoun, Lebanon (then Ottoman Syria) although they did not meet until both were living in the United States. Shiker, who had been a traveling salesman, settled in Lake Charles in the early 1900s and began to establish retail businesses, particularly general and drug stores. Both of them spoke French. Young Michael helped out with manual chores and keeping the books. DeBakey was the eldest of five children. His brother Ernest also became a physician, specializing in general and thoracic surgery. His sisters Lois and Selma were also scholarly, and eventually joined their eldest brother at Baylor College of Medicine as faculty members in medical communications. Another sister, Selena, died in 1952.

As a child, DeBakey learned to play the saxophone and was taught by his mother to sew, crochet, knit and tat. He could sew his own shirt by the age of 10. He also became intrigued with the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and is said by colleagues to have read it from beginning to end. He learned French and German and participated in a Boy Scout troop. He won awards for vegetables he had grown in his garden.

==Medical school==

DeBakey attended Tulane University, where he enrolled in a six-year program that combined undergraduate and medical school. He was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in 1930 and a M.D. in 1932.

During his final year in medical school at Tulane University, and prior to the establishment of blood banks, DeBakey adapted old pumps and rubber tubing and developed a version of the roller pump. He used the pump to transfuse blood directly and continuously from person to person, and this later became a component of the heart–lung machine.

==Postgraduate surgical training==

Between 1933 and 1935, DeBakey remained in New Orleans to complete his internship and residency in surgery at Charity Hospital, and in 1935, he received a MS for his research on stomach ulcers. As was the trend for ambitious training surgeons at the time, and as his mentors Rudolph Matas and Alton Ochsner had done before him, DeBakey was encouraged to complete his surgical fellowships at the University of Strasbourg, France, under Professor René Leriche, and at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, under Professor Martin Kirschner.

Returning to Tulane Medical School, DeBakey served on the surgical faculty from 1937 to 1948.

With his mentor, Alton Ochsner, in 1939 DeBakey postulated a strong link between smoking and carcinoma of the lung, a hypothesis that other researchers supported as well.

==Second World War==

During the Second World War, DeBakey served in the US Army in the Surgical Consultants&#x27; Division in the Office of the Surgeon General of the Army. In 1945, he was given the Legion of Merit award. Although sometimes credited in recent years for establishing the system of Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals, research has shown that DeBakey actually led the effort to prevent the establishment of these units.

Remaining in the U.S. Army for a year after the end of the war, he was instrumental in the ongoing care of wounded servicemen and helped establish the Veterans Administration and the Medical Follow-Up Agency. 
After the war, he returned to Tulane.

==Postwar surgical career==
DeBakey joined the faculty of Baylor University College of Medicine (now known as the Baylor College of Medicine) in 1948, serving as chairman of the surgical department until 1993. DeBakey was president of the college from 1969 to 1979, and served as its chancellor from 1979 to January 1996, when he was named chancellor emeritus. He was Olga Keith Wiess and Distinguished Service Professor in the Michael E. DeBakey Department of Surgery at Baylor College of Medicine and director of the DeBakey Heart Center for research and public education at Baylor College of Medicine and Houston Methodist Hospital.

DeBakey was a member of the medical advisory committee of the Hoover Commission and was chairman of the President&#x27;s Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Stroke during the Johnson Administration. He worked in numerous capacities to improve national and international standards of health care. Among his numerous consultative appointments, he served 3 terms on the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council of the National Institutes of Health.

DeBakey hired surgeon Denton Cooley at Baylor College of Medicine in 1951. They collaborated until Cooley&#x27;s resignation from his faculty position at the college in 1969.

=== Death of the Shah of Iran ===
In 1980 DeBakey was a consultant in the care of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the exiled Shah of Iran, who was in the terminal stages of lymphoma. Due to hypersplenism, the Shah underwent splenectomy in Cairo on March 28, 1980, with DeBakey supervising a team of surgeons. At operation, the Shah was found to be harboring widely metastatic disease. Several complications developed in the postoperative period, including a subphrenic abscess and pneumonia. Although these were successfully treated, the Shah succumbed to his malignancy on July 27.

=== Vascular surgery ===
In the 1950s, DeBakey&#x27;s observations and classification of atherosclerotic blood vessels permitted innovations in the treatments of vascular disease. His pursuit of the ideal material to make grafts led him to a department store that had run out of nylon, so he settled on polyethylene terephthalate (Dacron) and bought a yard of the material. Using his wife&#x27;s sewing machine, DeBakey produced the first arterial Dacron grafts to replace or repair blood vessels. He subsequently collaborated with a research associate from the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science to create a knitting machine for making grafts.

DeBakey performed the first successful carotid endarterectomy in 1953. A year later, he pioneered techniques in grafts for the various parts of the aorta.

DeBakey was among the earliest surgeons to perform coronary artery bypass surgery. A pioneer in the development of an artificial heart, he was among the first to use an external heart pump successfully in a patient – a left ventricular bypass pump.

In 1958, to counteract narrowing of an artery caused by an endarterectomy, DeBakey performed the first successful patch-graft angioplasty. This procedure involved patching the slit in the artery from an endarterectomy with a Dacron or vein graft. The patch widened the artery so that when it closed, the channel of the artery returned to normal size.

===Film===
In the 1960s, DeBakey and his team of surgeons performed some of the early instances of surgeries on film.

===Views on animal research===
DeBakey founded and chaired the Foundation for Biomedical Research (FBR), whose goal is to promote public understanding and support for animal research. DeBakey made wide use of animals in his research. He antagonized animal rights and animal welfare advocates who oppose the use of animals in the development of medical treatment for humans when he claimed that the &quot;future of biomedical research; and ultimately human health&quot; would be compromised if shelters stopped turning over surplus animals for medical research. Responding to the need for animal research, DeBakey stated that &quot;These scientists, veterinarians, physicians, surgeons and others who do research in animal labs are as much concerned about the care of the animals as anyone can be. Their respect for the dignity of life and compassion for the sick and disabled, in fact, is what motivated them to search for ways of relieving the pain and suffering caused by diseases.&quot;

==Later surgical career==

DeBakey continued to practice medicine until his death in 2008 at the age of 99. His contributions to the field of medicine spanned the better part of 75 years. DeBakey operated on more than 60,000 patients, including several heads of state. DeBakey and a team of American cardiothoracic surgeons, including George Noon, supervised quintuple-bypass surgery performed by Russian surgeons on Russian president Boris Yeltsin in 1996. On 29 April 1999, DeBakey oversaw an aorta-coronary bypass surgery of Azerbaijani president Heydar Aliyev in Cleveland, Ohio during Aliyev&#x27;s visit to the United States.

===Health issues===
In late 2005, DeBakey suffered an aortic dissection. Years prior, DeBakey had pioneered the surgical treatment that now bears his name to treat this condition. A sharp chest pain sent him to Houston Methodist Hospital, where the diagnosis was confirmed by a CT scan. 
DeBakey initially resisted the surgical option, but as his health deteriorated and DeBakey became unresponsive, the surgical team opted to proceed with surgical intervention. In a controversial decision, Houston Methodist&#x27;s ethics committee approved the operation; on February 9–10, DeBakey at age 98 became the oldest patient ever to undergo the surgery for which he was responsible. The operation by George Noon to repair his aorta with a Dacron graft, similar to one he had pioneered decades earlier, lasted seven hours. After a complicated post-operative course that required eight months in the hospital at a cost of over one million dollars, DeBakey was released in September 2006 and returned to good health.

==Selected honors and awards==

DeBakey became a member of numerous learned societies, gained 36 honorary degrees and was the recipient of hundreds of awards.

He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan awarded him the National Medal of Science. He was a Health Care Hall of Famer, a Lasker Luminary and a recipient of the United Nations Lifetime Achievement Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction. He was given the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Foundation for Biomedical Research and in 2000 was cited as a &quot;Living Legend&quot; by the Library of Congress. On April 23, 2008, he received the Congressional Gold Medal from President George W. Bush, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.

==Personal and family==
DeBakey married Diana Cooper after returning from Europe in 1937, and they had four sons: Michael, Denis, Ernest and Barry. After Diana died in 1972, he married German actress Katrin Fehlhaber, with whom he had a daughter, Olga-Katarina.

DeBakey has been described as a &quot;tough taskmaster&quot; by colleagues and trainees. Former trainee Jeremy R. Morton described how “he could be sweet as dripping honey when it came to patients and medical students, but could be brutal with surgical residents.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
DeBakey died from natural causes at Houston Methodist Hospital on July 11, 2008, at the age of 99. After lying in repose in Houston&#x27;s City Hall, the first ever to do so, DeBakey received a memorial service at the Co-Cathedral of the Sacred Heart on July 16, 2008. He was granted ground burial at Arlington National Cemetery by the Secretary of the Army. On January 21, 2009, DeBakey became the first posthumous recipient of the Denton A. Cooley Leadership Award.

===Michael E. DeBakey International Surgical Society===
In 1976, DeBakey&#x27;s trainees students founded the Michael E. DeBakey International Cardiovascular Surgical Society, which later changed its name to the Michael E. DeBakey International Surgical Society. Every two years, the Michael E. DeBakey Surgical Award is given.

===Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award===
The Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research, given by the Lasker Foundation since 1946, was renamed the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in DeBakey&#x27;s honor in 2008.

===Michael E. DeBakey Library and Museum===
In early 2008, DeBakey attended the groundbreaking for the new Michael E. DeBakey Library and Museum at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, which honors his life, work and dedication to care and teaching. The museum officially opened on Friday, May 14, 2010.

===DeBakey Medical Foundation===
In honor of DeBakey, the DeBakey Medical Foundation, in conjunction with Baylor College of Medicine, annually selects recipients of the Michael E. DeBakey, M.D., Excellence in Research Awards. The awards recognize faculty who have published outstanding scientific research contributions to clinical or basic biomedical research. The awards are funded by the DeBakey Medical Foundation and have funded researchers from the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children&#x27;s Cancer Center.

The foundation helped to establish the Michael E. DeBakey, Selma DeBakey and Lois DeBakey Endowed Scholarship Fund in Medical Humanities at Baylor University. The scholarship designates award recipients as &quot;DeBakey Scholars&quot; in recognition of the legacy of the DeBakey family.

===Other DeBakey institutes===

The DeBakey High School for Health Professions, Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart &amp; Vascular Center, and the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston at the Texas Medical Center in Houston are named after DeBakey. He had a role in establishing the Michael E. DeBakey Heart Institute at the Hays Medical Center in Kansas. Several atraumatic vascular surgical clamps and forceps that DeBakey introduced also bear his name. The Michael E. DeBakey Institute at Texas A&amp;M College of Veterinary Medicine &amp; Biomedical Sciences, founded as a collaboration between Texas A&amp;M, the Baylor College of Medicine and the UT Health Science Center at Houston for cardiovascular research, was named after DeBakey.

==Selected publications==
DeBakey&#x27;s writings are reflected in his authorship or co-authorship in more than 1,300 published medical articles, chapters, and books on various aspects of surgery, medicine, health, medical research, and medical education, as well as ethical, socio-economic and philosophic discussion in those fields. In addition to his scholarly writings, DeBakey co-authored popular works including &quot;The Living Heart&quot;, &quot;The Living Heart Shopper&#x27;s Guide&quot; and &quot;The Living Heart Guide to Eating Out&quot;. His publications include:

<doc id="382282" wikidata="Q7489508" url="?curid=382282" title="Share Our Wealth">
<text>Share Our Wealth was a movement that began in February 1934, during the Great Depression, by Huey Long, a governor and later United States Senator from Louisiana. Long first proposed the plan in a national radio address, which is now referred to as the &quot;Share Our Wealth Speech&quot;. To stimulate the economy, the Share Our Wealth program called for massive federal spending, a wealth tax, and wealth redistribution. These proposals drew wide support, with millions joining local Share Our Wealth clubs. Roosevelt adopted many of these proposals in the Second New Deal.

==Background==

Long believed that the underlying cause of the Great Depression – which he called &quot;Mr. Roosevelt&#x27;s depression&quot; – was the growing disparity between the rich and everyone else. For most of his political career, he focused his speeches and efforts on the &quot;little man&quot;, referring to the rural poor. The Share Our Wealth program was intended to become the capstone project for Long&#x27;s agenda.

==Proposed legislation==
In March 1933, Long offered a series of bills collectively known as &quot;the Long plan&quot; for the redistribution of wealth. The first bill proposed a new progressive tax code designed to cap personal fortunes at $100 million ($2.372 billion in 2024 dollars). Fortunes above $1 million ($23.72 million in 2024) would be taxed at 1%; fortunes above $2 million ($47.45 million in 2024) would be taxed at 2%, and so forth, up to a 100% tax on fortunes greater than $100 million. The second bill would limit annual income to $1 million ($23.72 million in 2024), and the third bill would cap individual inheritances at $5 million ($118.6 million in 2024).

In February 1934, Long introduced his &quot;Share Our Wealth&quot; plan over a nationwide radio broadcast.

His plan was to minimize wealth inequality, via Federal tax and spend policy.

An individual&#x27;s right to wealth would be restricted to:
* a maximum INHERITANCE of $5 million ($118.6 million in 2024);
* a maximum annual INCOME of $1 million ($23.72 million in 2024);
* and an individual&#x27;s private WEALTH/FORTUNE to $50 million ($1.186 billion in 2024).

The taxes raised would guarantee every family what Long called a &quot;Household Estate&quot; of $5,000 (a Basic Household Grant worth $118,600 in 2024) and a minimum annual income of $2,000–$3,000 (a Universal Basic Income to each household of $47,450–$71,175 per year, 2024), or one-third of the average family home value and income.

* free Higher education (including degree-level study at a college, and vocational internships/training required to enter professional organisations);
* a mandatory 30 hour (four day) working week and a minimum of four weeks paid vacation per year 
* a Pension of $30/month, $360 a year ($711.73 and $8,540.76 in 2024) paid to every person from the age of 65;
* for direct Federal assistance to farmers;
* public works projects, including a $10 billion ($237.2 billion in 2024) land reclamation project to end the Dust Bowl;
* specific to the WWI veterans, benefits would increase, and World War I veteran&#x27;s adjusted Compensation certificates, due in 1945 would be issued immediately.
* free medical services for all citizens, and what he called a &quot;war on disease&quot; led by the Mayo brothers.

Long intended for his reforms to bring an end to the Great Depression.

==Reception==
===Economic criticism===
Long&#x27;s plans for the &quot;Share Our Wealth&quot; program attracted much criticism from economists at the time, who stated that Long&#x27;s plans for redistributing wealth would not result in every American family receiving a grant of $5,000 per year, but rather $400/per year, and that his plans for taxation would cap the average annual income at about $3,000. They argued that the confiscated fortunes would only yield $1.50 per each poor family. In 1934, Long held a public debate with Norman Thomas, the leader of the Socialist Party of America, on the merits of Share Our Wealth versus socialism.
===Share Our Wealth club===
With the Senate unwilling to support his proposals, in February 1934 Long formed a national political organization, the Share Our Wealth Society. A network of local clubs led by national organizer Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith, the Share Our Wealth Society was intended to operate outside of and in opposition to the Democratic Party and the Roosevelt administration. By 1935, the society had over 7.5 million members in 27,000 clubs across the country. Long&#x27;s Senate office received an average of 60,000 letters a week, resulting in Long hiring 48 stenographers to type responses. Of the two trucks that delivered mail to the Senate, one was devoted solely to mail for Long. Long&#x27;s newspaper, now renamed &quot;American Progress&quot;, averaged a circulation of 300,000, with some issues reaching over 1.5 million. Long&#x27;s radical programs were very attractive to union-members; Teamsters president Daniel J. Tobin expressed his growing concerns to Roosevelt. Long also drew international attention: writer H. G. Wells traveled across the Atlantic just to interview Long. Wells noted that Long was &quot;like a Winston Churchill who has never been at Harrow. He abounds in promises.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Program mismanagement after Long&#x27;s death===
Any presidential ambitions which Long might have had were cut short when he was shot by an assassin in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on September 8, 1935; he died two days later. Control of the Share Our Wealth Society fell to Gerald L. K. Smith, who was widely viewed as a political demagogue. Smith brought the Share Our Wealth Society into a brief coalition with the followers of radio priest Charles Coughlin and old-age pension advocate Francis Townsend in support of the short-lived Union Party, a third party effort which ran William Lemke of North Dakota for President in 1936, but under his leadership, the Share Our Wealth movement quickly fell apart.

===Influence on the New Deal===
Some historians believe that pressure from Long and his organization contributed to Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;turn to the left&quot; in the Second New Deal (1935), which consisted of the Social Security Act, the Works Progress Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, Aid to Dependent Children, and the Wealth Tax Act of 1935. Each tenet of the Second New Deal seemed to foil one of Long&#x27;s corresponding proposals. For example, Roosevelt&#x27;s National Youth Administration provided part-time employment to the country&#x27;s youth, counteracting the appeal for Long&#x27;s free college proposal. Roosevelt reportedly admitted in private to trying to &quot;steal Long&#x27;s thunder.&quot;

<doc id="382287" wikidata="Q742162" url="?curid=382287" title="Order of Ontario">
<text>The Order of Ontario () is the most prestigious official honour in the Canadian province of Ontario. Instituted in 1986 by Lieutenant Governor Lincoln Alexander, on the advice of the Cabinet under Premier David Peterson, the civilian order is administered by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council and is intended to honour current or former Ontario residents for conspicuous achievements in any field.

==Structure and appointment==

The Order of Ontario is intended to honour any current or former longtime resident of Ontario who has demonstrated a high level of individual excellence and achievement in any field, demonstrating &quot;the best of Ontario&#x27;s caring and diverse society and [whose] lives have benefited society in Ontario and elsewhere.&quot; Canadian citizenship is not a requirement and elected or appointed members of a governmental body are ineligible as long as they hold office. There are no limits on how many can belong to the order or be invested at one time, though the average number of new members stands at 24 per year.

The process of finding qualified individuals begins with submissions from the public to the Ontario Honours and Awards Secretariat, which consists of the Chief Justice of Ontario (who serves as the chairperson), the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the Secretary of the Cabinet, and up to six members of the Order of Ontario. This committee then meets once or twice yearly to make its selected recommendations to the Cabinet and works with that body in narrowing down the potential appointees to a list that will be submitted to the lieutenant governor. Since appointments to the Order of Ontario rely in part on ministerial advice, records of such proceedings are not publicly revealed, as affirmed in court proceedings undertaken in 2002 by an individual who had been mistakenly informed that she had been appointed to the order. Posthumous nominations are not accepted, though an individual who dies after their name was submitted to the Honours and Awards Secretariat can still be retroactively made a Member of the Order of Ontario. The lieutenant governor, &quot;ex officio&quot; a member and the Chancellor of the Order of Ontario, then makes all appointments into the fellowship&#x27;s single grade of membership by an Order in Council that bears the viceroyal sign-manual; thereafter, the new members are entitled to use the post-nominal letters &quot;OOnt&quot;.

==Insignia==

Upon admission into the Order of Ontario, new members are presented with the order&#x27;s insignia. The main badge consists of a gold medallion in the form of a stylized trillium, the official provincial flower. The obverse is white enamel with gold edging, bearing at its centre the escutcheon of the arms of Ontario, all surmounted by a St Edward&#x27;s Crown symbolizing the Canadian monarch&#x27;s role as the fount of honour. The name of the member is engraved on the reverse, along with the date of their investiture. The order&#x27;s ribbon is patterned with vertical stripes in red, green, white, and gold, reflecting the colours within the provincial coat of arms. The insignia is worn suspended from this ribbon at the collar; women may carry theirs on a ribbon bow at the left chest. Members also receive two lapel pins that can be worn during less formal occasions, and an official certificate.

To mark the 30th anniversary of the first investiture of the Order of Ontario, a collar featuring the insignia of the order and symbols of Canada and Ontario was unveiled for the use of the Lieutenant Governor as Chancellor of the Order of Ontario.

<doc id="382288" wikidata="Q4345969" url="?curid=382288" title="Union Party (United States)">
<text>The Union Party was a short-lived political party in the United States, formed in 1935 by a coalition of radio priest Father Charles Coughlin, old-age pension advocate Francis Townsend, and Gerald L. K. Smith, who had taken control of Huey Long&#x27;s Share Our Wealth (SOW) movement after Long&#x27;s assassination in 1935. Each of those people hoped to channel their wide followings into support for the Union Party, which proposed a populist alternative to the New Deal reforms of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression.

The party nominated a ticket consisting of Republican Congressman William Lemke and labor attorney Thomas C. O&#x27;Brien in the 1936 presidential election. Running against Republican nominee Alf Landon, Roosevelt won a second term with over 60% of the popular vote, while Lemke won just under 2% of the popular vote. The Union Party collapsed after the 1936 elections. Lemke served as a Republican Congressman until his death in 1950, while Coughlin and Townsend receded from national politics. Smith later founded the Christian Nationalist Crusade and became a prominent proponent of Holocaust denial.

==Background==
Many observers at the time felt that there was a place for a party more radical than Roosevelt and the Democrats but still non-Marxist in the political spectrum of the time.

Newton Jenkins&#x27;s campaign in the 1935 Chicago mayoral election acted as an informal test-run for the fledgling movement behind the Union Party.

===Rumored political aspirations of Huey Long===
Although many people expected Huey Long, the colorful Democratic senator from Louisiana, to run as a third-party candidate with his &quot;Share Our Wealth&quot; program as his platform, his bid was cut short when he was assassinated in September 1935.

Prior to Long&#x27;s death, leading contenders for the role of the sacrificial 1936 candidate included Senators Burton K. Wheeler (D-Montana) and William E. Borah (R-Idaho), and Governor Floyd B. Olson (FL-Minnesota). After the assassination, however, the two senators lost interest in the idea (Borah ran as a Republican, garnering only a few delegates and losing the nomination to Kansas governor Alf Landon) and Olson was diagnosed with terminal stomach cancer.

==Problems and controversies==
The Union Party suffered from a multiplicity of problems almost from the moment of its inception. A primary one was that each of the party&#x27;s three principal leaders seemingly saw himself, not its presidential nominee William Lemke, as the real power figure and natural leader of the party. His charisma attracted more people than did the other candidates. Another was that each man&#x27;s movement was largely held together by personality more than a truly cohesive ideology: in the case of Coughlin and Townsend their own personalities; in the case of Smith, the memory of the late Huey Long&#x27;s charismatic personality. Smith himself was considered a far less charismatic figure. Some critics charged that the Union Party was in fact controlled by Father Coughlin, a former Roosevelt supporter who had broken with Roosevelt and by 1936 had become an antisemite. Smith had also turned to antisemitism, which was not consistent with the views of Long, Townsend, and Lemke, and reduced the appeal of the group among many progressives.

The Union Party attracted modest support from populists on both sides of the political spectrum who were unhappy with Roosevelt and from the remnants of earlier third parties such as the Farmer-Labor Party. Others such as &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine were wary of the new party and backed Roosevelt. Presaging more recent debates over the Reform Party, the Green Party, H. Ross Perot, and Ralph Nader, some falsely considered the party either a left-wing spoiler party which would hurt Roosevelt, or an unworkable alliance between left-wing and right-wing populists. More traditional parties on the left such as the Socialist Party denounced the Union Party.

==1936 presidential nominee==
William Lemke, a U.S. Congressman from North Dakota, was chosen as the party&#x27;s nominee for the 1936 presidential election.

The vice-presidential nominee was Thomas C. O&#x27;Brien, a labor lawyer from Boston.

==Other notable candidates==
Jacob S. Coxey of Coxey&#x27;s Army fame, socialist leader and frequent independent candidate for the United States Congress, ran for Congress in 1936 on the Union Party ticket in Ohio&#x27;s 16th District. He received 2,384 votes or 1.6% of the vote (4th place).

==Demise ==
The Union Party was disbanded shortly after the 1936 elections. Presidential nominee Lemke continued to serve in Congress as a Republican, and died in office while serving an eighth term. Father Coughlin announced his retirement from the airwaves immediately after the disappointing returns of the 1936 election, but returned to the air within a couple of months; upon U.S. entry into World War II, the Roman Catholic Church ordered Father Coughlin to retire from the airwaves and return to his duties as a parish priest, and he died in obscurity in 1979. Townsend, already quite elderly, saw his movement largely supplanted by the enactment of Social Security the next year and also largely became quite obscure afterwards, although he lived until 1960. Smith became even more of a radical fringe figure who eventually became an early proponent of Holocaust denial. He died in 1976.

== Other namesakes==

In the 1864 presidential election the Republican Party of incumbent President Abraham Lincoln ran as the &quot;National Union Party&quot; or &quot;Union Party&quot;. The name was a reference to the Union faction of the American Civil War. Coughlin took the Union label for his own party, comparing the &quot;financial slavery&quot; of the 1930s to the &quot;physical slavery&quot; of the 1860s.

In the 1980 presidential election, John B. Anderson&#x27;s independent bid for the presidency against Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter was in many states run on the party ballot line of the &quot;National Union Party&quot;. Anderson won 6.6% of the popular vote and no electoral votes.

<doc id="382289" wikidata="Q1612220" url="?curid=382289" title="Wirksworth">
<text>Wirksworth is a market town and civil parish in the Derbyshire Dales district of Derbyshire, England. Its population of 4,904 in the 2021 Census was estimated at 5,220 in 2023. Wirksworth contains the source of the River Ecclesbourne. The town was granted a market charter by Edward I in 1306 and still holds a market on Tuesdays in the Memorial Gardens. The parish church of St Mary&#x27;s is thought to date from 653. The town developed as a centre for lead mining and stone quarrying. Many lead mines were owned by the Gell family of nearby Hopton Hall.

==Name==
The name was recorded as &quot;Werchesworde&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086 A.D. 
Outlying farms (berewicks) were Cromford, Middleton, Hopton, Wellesdene [sic], Carsington, Kirk Ireton and Callow. It gave its name to the earlier Wirksworth wapentake or hundred. The Survey of English Place-Names records Wyrcesuuyrthe in 835, Werchesworde in 1086, and Wirksworth(e) in 1536.

The toponym might be &quot;Weorc&#x27;s enclosure&quot;, or &quot;fortified enclosure&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The origins of Wirksworth are thought to have related to the presence of thermal warm water springs nearby, coupled with a sheltered site at the head of a glaciated valley, able to yield cereals such as oats and provide timber suitable for building.

The Wirksworth area in the White Peak is known for Neolithic and Bronze Age remains. Woolly rhino bones were found by lead miners in 1822 in Dream Cave, on private land between Wirksworth and present-day Carsington Water. A nearby cave at Carsington Pasture yielded prehistoric finds in the late 20th century.

===Lead mining===
In Roman Britain, the limestone area of today&#x27;s Derbyshire yielded lead, the prime site probably being &quot;Lutudarum&quot; in the hills south and west of present-day Matlock. Wirksworth is a candidate for the site of &quot;Lutudarum&quot;. Roman roads from Wirksworth lead to Buxton (The Street) and to Brough-on-Noe (The Portway). The town has the oldest charter of any in the Peak District, dating from 835, when the Abbess of Wirksworth granted nearby land to Duke Humbert of Mercia.

Many lead mines in Anglo-Saxon times were owned by Repton Abbey. Three of these are identified in Wirksworth&#x27;s Domesday Book entry from 1086. Scientists studying a Swiss glacial ice core have found that levels of lead in European air pollution between 1170 and 1216 were similar to those during the Industrial Revolution, pointing to the local lead and silver smelting around Wirksworth, Castleton etc. as the main source with a remarkable correlation. There is a tiny carving in Wirksworth Church of a miner with a pick and whisket (basket); the figure is known as &quot;T&#x27;Owd Man of Bonsall.&quot; It stood in Bonsall Church for centuries, but was moved for safekeeping during a restoration project. It was later found in a Bonsall garden and moved to Wirksworth by the vicar of the time. The ore was washed out through a sieve, whose iron wire had been drawn in Hathersage since the Middle Ages. Smelting took place in boles, hence the name &quot;Bolehill&quot;. The lead industry, the miner, the ore and the waste were also known collectively as &quot;t&#x27;owd man&quot;.

A barmote court was established in the town in 1288 during the reign of Edward I in order to regulate lead mining; anyone had a right to dig for ore wherever he chose, except in churchyards, gardens or roadways. All that was needed for a claim was to place one&#x27;s stowce (winch) on the site and extract enough ore to pay tribute to the &quot;barmaster&quot;. The present Moot Hall, where the barmote court met, dates from 1814.

By the 18th century, there were many thousand lead mines worked individually. Daniel Defoe gives a first-hand account of such a family and the miner at work. At this time, the London Lead Company was formed to provide finance for deeper mines with drainage channels, called soughs, and introduce Newcomen steam-engine pumps.
Many institutions in the area have ties with the Gell family of nearby Hopton Hall. One member, Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet, fought on Parliament&#x27;s side in the Civil War. A predecessor, Anthony Gell, founded the local grammar school, and a successor, Phillip Gell, opened the Via Gellia (perhaps an allusion to the Roman Via Appia), a road from the family lead mines round Wirksworth to a smelter in Cromford. More recently he has been remembered in the name of Anthony Gell School.

===Limestone===
The carboniferous limestone around Wirksworth has been much quarried over the town&#x27;s history, resulting in several rock faces and cliffs surrounding the town. There was a workhouse from 1724 to 1829, called &quot;Babington House&quot;, standing on Green Hill () and housing 60 inmates.

===Industrial revolution===
In 1777, Richard Arkwright leased land and premises for a corn mill from Philip Eyre Gell of Hopton and converted it to spin cotton, using his water frame. It was the world&#x27;s first cotton mill to use a steam engine to replenish the millpond that drove its waterwheel. The mill was adjacent to another, Speedwell Mill, owned by John Dalley, a local merchant. Arkwright&#x27;s mill was sublet in 1792, when Arkwright&#x27;s son, Richard, began to sell off family property and move into banking. It was named Haarlem Mill in 1815, when converted to weaving tape by Madely, Hackett and Riley, who had set up Haarlem Tape Works in Derby in 1806. In 1879 the Wheatcroft family, which produced tape at Speedwell Mill, expanded into Haarlem. The two mills together employed 230; their weekly output was said to equal the circumference of the earth; Wirksworth was the main producer of red tape for Whitehall. These mills were close together at Miller&#x27;s Green next to the Derby road. Haarlem Mill now houses an art collective; Speedwell Mill has been replaced by private houses and a carpentry workshop. The growing prosperity of the town led to the development of Wirksworth Town Hall in 1871.

==Geography==
In the 2011 census, Wirksworth civil parish had 2,416 dwellings, 2,256 households and a population of 5,038.

Areas of Wirksworth include Yokecliffe to the west, Gorseybank and Bournebrook to the south-east, Miller&#x27;s Green to the south-west, and Steeple Grange and Bolehill to the north. Bolehill, although technically a hamlet in its own right in Wirksworth&#x27;s suburbs, is the oldest and most northerly part of the town, while Yokecliffe is a large estate in the westerly area. Modern houses have been built in the Three Trees area and at the bottom of Steeple Grange (Spring Close and Meerbrook Drive).

In the future, it is planned to build new housing estates to the north of the centre and in the disused Middle Peak Quarry. These will total around 800 houses if they come to fruition.

==Education==
There are five schools in Wirksworth: Church of England and county infants, and regularly combined but on two sites, Wirksworth Junior School, the Anthony Gell School and Callow Park College. 

Anthony Gell was a local, requested by Agnes Fearne to build a grammar school on her death. The original site is now a private house on the edge of the churchyard. The current school is an 11–18 comprehensive, built on a larger site by the Hannage Brook with about 800 pupils. The school&#x27;s five houses are named after Fearne, Arkwright (Sir Richard Arkwright), Wright (Joseph Wright of Derby), Gell and Nightingale (Florence Nightingale). Its catchment area is the town and surrounding villages: Middleton, Carsington, Brassington, Kirk Ireton, Turnditch, Matlock Bath, Cromford and Crich. The Anthony Gell School qualifies as a Sports College.

==Transport==

Wirksworth railway station is a stop on the heritage Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. Services operate to and from , which provides a connection to the National Rail network for ongoing East Midlands Railway services to , and on the Derwent Valley Line.

The town is served by five bus routes:
* 6.1 between Derby and Bakewell, operated by Trent Barton

* X17 to Matlock, Sheffield and Barnsley, operated by Stagecoach Yorkshire
* 110 between Matlock and Ashbourne, operated by Hulleys of Baslow.
* 111 between Matlock and Ashbourne, serving different villages to the 110, operated by Hulleys of Baslow.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the local relay TV transmitter.

Wirksworth&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby on 95.3 FM, Capital Midlands on 102.8 FM, and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands on 101.8 FM.

The &quot;Matlock Mercury&quot; is the town&#x27;s weekly local newspaper.

==Culture and community==
===Events===

* Early April: Wirksworth Book Festival, launched in 2016, is a sister event to the Wirksworth Festival, celebrating books and reading, particularly local writers.
* Early June: Wirksworth well dressing and carnival. This was adapted after the arrival of piped water, so that taps as well as wells are decorated.
* First Sunday after 8 September: Clipping the church, an ancient custom, in which the congregation join hands to encircle the building. This occurs on the Sunday after the Feast of the Nativity, the church&#x27;s dedication.
* September: Wirksworth Festival, which has celebrated and promoted arts in the town since 1995. It features crafts, exhibitions and street theatre.
* First weekend in December: The Glee Club holds an annual pantomime.

===Community facilities===
Fanny Shaw&#x27;s Playing Field, just beyond the centre, is the main recreation area for the north of the town. It includes a play area. In the south is the &quot;Rec&quot;, another children&#x27;s play area, along with cricket and football pitches. There are public toilets in the car park alongside the United Reformed Church at Baromote Croft.

Haarlem Mill has been mentioned as the possible model for the mill in George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;. The town of Snowfield in George Eliot&#x27;s Adam Bede is also said to be based in Wirksworth; Dinah Morris, a character in that novel, is based on Eliot&#x27;s aunt, who lived in Wirksworth and whose husband ran the silk mill, which used to house the Wirksworth Heritage Centre.

Wirksworth was the main location of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Medicine&quot; in 2003, having featured as an occasional location in its forerunner, &quot;Peak Practice&quot;. More recently, some of &quot;Mobile&quot; was filmed on a train on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway, and much of an episode of the BBC series &quot;Casualty&quot; was set in the town.

Wirksworth features in the 2015 memoir, &quot;The Long Road Out of Town&quot;, by author and journalist Greg Watts, who grew up there.

Middle Peak Quarry, on the outskirts of Wirksworth, featured in the 2010 music video &quot;Unlikely Hero&quot; by the Hoosiers.

===Town twinning===
Wirksworth is twinned with Die in southern France and with Frankenau in the Kellerwald range south-west of the Talgang, Germany, through the Wirksworth Twinning Association.

==Notable residents==
*Lawrence Beesley (1877–1967) was an English science teacher, journalist and author who was a survivor of the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot;.
*Abraham Bennet (1749–1799) was curate of Wirksworth and did important early work in electricity, in association with Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of the naturalist Charles Darwin. There is a memorial plaque to him in Wirksworth Church and a portrait by an unknown artist.
*Anthony Draycot (died 1571) was rector of the parish from 1535 until his imprisonment in 1560. He was the judge at the heresy trial where Joan Waste was condemned to be burnt.
*D. H. Lawrence (1885–1930) lived at Mountain Cottage with his wife Frieda in 1918–1919. It stands below the B5023 road on the edge of Middleton-by-Wirksworth, about north-west of Wirksworth. Lawrence reputedly spent time also at Woodland Cottage on the far side of New Road. While in Middleton in the bitter winter of 1918–1919, he wrote the short story &quot;A Wintry Peacock&quot;, published in 1921.
*Frederick Treves (1853–1923), surgeon and author, was in practice in the town in 1877–1879. A house in Coldwell Street is named after him.
*John Woodward, naturalist (1665–1728), may have been born here.

==Landmarks==

<text>The George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine, also commonly referred to as simply the George Foreman Grill, is a portable double-sided electrically heated grill manufactured by Spectrum Brands. It is promoted by two-time world heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman. Since its introduction in 1994, over 100 million George Foreman grills have been sold worldwide.

==History==
The concept for the grill was created by Michael Boehm of Batavia, Illinois. The original intention was to create an indoor grill that cooked on both sides at once. A second key benefit was to reduce the fat content of hamburgers and other meats by draining away the fat into a separate reservoir. Boehm designed the product with a floating hinge and slanted grilling surface to accommodate foods of differing thicknesses and drain fat away from the food. Engineering work was performed by Bob Johnson. Boehm and Johnson brought a JVC camcorder and a sample of the product in bright yellow to the office of Barbara Westfield at Salton, Inc. The video was played, showing fat dripping from the grill into the collection tray. They presented the product as &quot;The Fajita Express&quot;. The fajita grill had been promoted at industry trade shows in the early 1990s, but garnered little interest.

The slanted grill concept was pitched by Tsann Kuen to Salton, Inc. After one year, and several trade shows, Salton sent samples of the grill to George Foreman&#x27;s colleagues, who then sent the grill to Foreman to test. Boehm was not involved in teaming up the grill and Foreman. Salton made several changes to the technical function of the product, removing the four risers meant for the user to lift up the grill, slide in one of the two included trays, and fill taco shells. One tray was for grease of fajita meat, and the second tray was to hold a taco shell, as was shown in the demonstration to Westfield in the original presentation at the Salton office in Mount Prospect, Illinois.

The Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine, as it became known, was introduced in 1994 and promoted with distinctive infomercials which featured Foreman. A combination of his affable personality and the unique features of the product made it a huge success. Such was the popularity of these infomercials that Foreman&#x27;s tagline, &quot;It&#x27;s so good I put my name on it!&quot;, is now part of popular culture. In Asia, the grill is endorsed and promoted by both George Foreman and Jackie Chan.

==Design==

The product has a clamshell design that simultaneously heats the top and bottom surfaces of the food, eliminating the need to flip it. Each heating surface is grooved to reduce contact area, and covered in a non-stick coating. The lower heating surface is angled to allow hot, liquid fat and other fluids to drain through the grooves into a removable drip tray, which shows the amount removed from the food. This arrangement has been marketed as a way to &quot;knock out the fat&quot;, suggesting a healthier way to cook. 

The grill is offered in various sizes for cooking individual or multiple servings. In 2006, the George Foreman &quot;Next Grilleration&quot; Health Grill was launched, featuring detachable grilling plates for easier cleaning. It has gone through several other versions, differing in their control interfaces and design.

In 2014, an updated Foreman Grill was released called the &quot;Evolve Grill&quot;. The Evolve grill features interchangeable PTFE-free ceramic plates. The plates available are the traditional grill plates, waffle plates, a bake dish, mini burgers, a flat griddle, and a muffin pan.

==Reception==
The worldwide popularity of the George Foreman grill has resulted in sales of over 100 million units since it was first launched, a feat that was achieved in a little over 15 years. Although Foreman has never confirmed exactly how much he has earned from the endorsement, Salton, Inc. paid him $138 million in 1999 in order to buy out the right to use his name. Previous to that he was being paid about 40 percent of the profits on each grill sold, earning him $4.5 million a month at its peak, so it is estimated he has made a total of over $200 million from the endorsement, a sum that is substantially more than he earned as a boxer.

==Competition==
The success of the George Foreman Grill spawned a variety of similar celebrity-endorsed products, such as the Evander Holyfield Real Deal Grill, for which Holyfield starred in a 2007 infomercial, and the Carl Lewis Health Grill. None of these imitators, however, achieved the level of success of the Foreman Grill. The Jackie Chan Grill is the same grill as the George Foreman grill, but targets the Asian market, and is marketed by both Jackie Chan and George Foreman.

<text>The Chief Jean Baptiste de Richardville House was built near Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1827. Subsidized by the U.S. federal government through the 1826 Treaty of Mississinewas, it is believed to be one of only three treaty houses built east of the Mississippi River. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on March 2, 2012.

==History==
Chief Richardville, the principal chief of the Miami from 1812 until his death in 1841, signed several treaties with the United States government as it negotiated with the Miami tribe for its eventual removal from Indiana as a recognized nation. Lands were reserved for Richardville&#x27;s personal use, and $600 was provided for the building of a home.

The Richardville House&#x27;s architecture reflects both Greek Revival and Federal styles. When completed, using both the government&#x27;s and his own funds, Richardville&#x27;s Fort Wayne home was the equal in style and grandeur of the homes of prominent white residents of the area at that time. The Allen County-Fort Wayne Historical Society acquired the house in 1991 with money donated by the Foellinger Foundation and the Ropchan Foundation.

Farther south and west lies the trading and meeting place where the Wabash River and the Wabash and Erie Canal intersected in Huntington, Indiana. Here is another home owned by Richardville (lived in by Chief LaFontaine)– a white, two-story Greek Revival filled with period furniture and portraits of the owners. This is also the site where treaties were signed. Today, this house forms the centerpiece of the historic Forks of the Wabash park.

<doc id="382309" wikidata="Q3081716" url="?curid=382309" title="Francis Townsend">
<text>Francis Everett Townsend (; January 13, 1867 – September 1, 1960) was an American physician and political activist in California. In 1933, he devised an old-age pension scheme to help alleviate the Great Depression. Known as the &quot;Townsend Plan&quot;, this proposal would pay every person over age 60 $200 per month, with the requirement it all be spent quickly. It was never enacted but the popularity of the Plan influenced Congress to start the Social Security system, which involved much smaller amounts. The Plan was organized by real estate salesman Robert Clements, who made Townsend only a figurehead while the Plan expanded to thousands of clubs in many states. Townsend was born just outside Fairbury, Illinois, where he is memorialized by a post office named in his honor.

==Life and career==
Francis Everett Townsend was born the second of six children on January 13, 1867, in Fairbury, Illinois. After Townsend contracted swamp malaria as an infant, the Townsend family moved to Nebraska where Townsend had two years of high school education. In 1898, Townsend borrowed $1,000 from his father and moved to Southern California to develop a hay farming business. The business was not successful, and Townsend enrolled in Omaha Medical College when he was 31. After graduating, Townsend worked in the medical field in Belle Fourche, South Dakota, and met a nurse and his future wife, Wilhelmina &quot;Minnie&quot; Bogue. At age 50, Townsend enlisted as a doctor in the army one year before the end of World War I.

After the war ended in 1918, Townsend moved to Long Beach, California, to run a dry ice factory. After that business quickly failed, Townsend worked for real estate agent Robert Earl Clements in Midway City, California. Clements later masterminded the Townsend Plan. In 1930, at the start of the Great Depression, Townsend became a Long Beach city public health officer at age 63, but lost his job three years later.

Townsend died in Los Angeles on September 1, 1960. He is buried in Woodlawn Memorial Park in Compton, California.

==Townsend Plan==
The Townsend Plan proposed that every person over 60 be paid $200 per month. The Old-Age Revolving Pension fund was to be supported by a 2% national sales tax aiming to stimulate the economy.

There were three requirements for beneficiaries under the scheme:

* they had to be retired;
* they had to be &quot;free from habitual criminality&quot;;
* they had to spend the money within 30 days (to stimulate the economy).

===Promoting the plan===

In September 1933, Townsend wrote a letter to the editor of the local newspaper (the &quot;Long Beach Press-Telegram&quot;), and launched his career as an old-age activist. According to Townsend&#x27;s autobiographical memoir, &quot;New Horizons&quot; (1943), his plan originated when he looked out his window one morning in the early depth of the Depression and saw two old women, dressed in once nice, now tattered clothes, picking through his garbage cans looking for food. Within two years of his putting forward his plan, over 3400 Townsend Plan Clubs were organized all over America and began exerting pressure on Congress to pass an old-age pension. Frances Perkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of Labor, in her memoir, &quot;The Roosevelt I Knew&quot; (p. 294) says that Roosevelt told her, &quot;We have to have it [Social Security]. Congress can&#x27;t stand the pressure of the Townsend Plan unless we have a real old-age insurance system.&quot; As Roosevelt said, Social Security was passed by Congress substituting a pay-as-you-go &quot;insurance&quot; scheme for Townsend&#x27;s far more generous pension plan, but as he told Perkins, it was the Townsend Clubs that forced Congress to act at all.

===After the adoption of Social Security and Townsend&#x27;s death===
The movement continued beyond Townsend&#x27;s death in 1960. In 1978, The Associated Press reported that the National Townsend Plan would be shut down by the end of February that year, with only state chapters surviving, and that by then it had a &quot;dwindling and aging membership.&quot;

==Investigation==
A Congressional committee was established in February 1936 to investigate Townsend. One of the findings was that the Townsend organization had raised over a million dollars and that Townsend had received a salary of $12,000 for the previous 12 months.

While being questioned Townsend became angry at the questioning and stormed out. He was prosecuted for contempt of Congress and sentenced to 30 days in prison. However, in 1938, just as he entered jail to serve his sentence, he was granted a pardon by President Roosevelt.

<doc id="382312" wikidata="Q1143779" url="?curid=382312" title="St Thomas' Hospital">
<text>St Thomas&#x27; Hospital is a large NHS teaching hospital in Central London, England. Administratively part of the Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; NHS Foundation Trust, together with Guy&#x27;s Hospital, Evelina London Children&#x27;s Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital and other sites. It is also a member of King&#x27;s Health Partners, an academic health science centre, and is one of three sites used by King&#x27;s College London GKT School of Medical Education.

The hospital was established in the Middle Ages and named for St Thomas Becket. Originally located in Southwark, but based in Lambeth since 1871, the hospital has provided healthcare freely or under charitable auspices since the 12th century. It is one of London&#x27;s most famous hospitals, associated with people such as Sir Astley Cooper, William Cheselden, Florence Nightingale, Alicia Lloyd Still, Linda Richards, Edmund Montgomery, Agnes Elizabeth Jones and Sir Harold Ridley. It is a prominent London landmark – largely due to its location on the opposite bank of the River Thames to the Houses of Parliament.

St Thomas&#x27; Hospital is accessible from Westminster tube station (a 10-minute walk across Westminster Bridge), Waterloo station (tube and national rail, also a 10-minute walk) and Lambeth North tube station (another 10-minute walk).

==History==
===The Hospital at The Borough, Southwark===

The hospital was described as ancient in 1215 and was named after St Thomas Becket – which suggests it may have been founded after 1173 when Becket was canonised. This date was when it was relocated from the precinct of St Mary Overie Priory to &quot;Trenet Lane&quot;, then later to St Thomas Street. However, it is possible it was only renamed in 1173 and that there was an infirmary at the priory when it was founded at Southwark in 1106.

Originally the hospital was run by a mixed order of Augustinian canons regular and canonesses regular, dedicated to St Thomas Becket, and provided shelter and treatment for the poor, sick, and homeless. In the 15th century, Richard Whittington endowed a lying-in ward for unmarried mothers. The monastery was dissolved in 1539 during the Reformation and the hospital closed but reopened in 1551 and rededicated to Thomas the Apostle. This was due to the efforts of the City of London who obtained the grant of the site and a charter of 1553 from Edward VI (26th June, 7 Edw. VI) establishing three institutions Bridewell Hospital, Christ&#x27;s Hospital and St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. The hospital has remained open ever since.

The hospital was also where one of the first printed English Bibles was produced in 1537, and this is commemorated by a plaque on the surviving wing in Borough High Street. The plaque inaccurately refers to &quot;the first printed Bible in English&quot; rather than &quot;one of the first&quot;.

There were some twenty-four priors, masters, wardens or rectors who served between the foundation of the hospital and the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539.

Dr. Eleazar Hodson was the first St Thomas&#x27; physician about whom the medical historian Joseph Frank Payne was able to find any precise information. Hodson received his medical degree at Padua in 1612 and became F.R.C.P. in 1618. At the end of the 17th century, the hospital and church were largely rebuilt by Sir Robert Clayton, president of the hospital and a former Lord Mayor of London. Thomas Cartwright was the architect for the work. A statue of Clayton now stands at the north entrance to Ward Block of North Wing at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and is Grade I listed. In 1721 Sir Thomas Guy, a governor of St Thomas&#x27;, founded Guy&#x27;s Hospital as a place to treat &#x27;incurables&#x27; discharged from St Thomas&#x27;.



Some parts of the old St Thomas&#x27; Hospital survive on the north side of St Thomas Street, Southwark including the old St. Thomas&#x27; Church, now used mostly as offices but including the Old Operating Theatre, which is now a museum. However the hospital left Southwark in 1862, when its ancient site was compulsorily purchased to make way for the construction of the Charing Cross railway viaduct from London Bridge Station. The hospital was temporarily housed at Royal Surrey Gardens in Newington (Walworth) until new buildings on the present site in Lambeth near Lambeth Palace were completed in 1871.

===The Victorian hospital in Lambeth===
The present-day St Thomas&#x27; Hospital is located at a site historically known as Stangate in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is directly across the River Thames from the Palace of Westminster on a plot of land largely reclaimed from the river during construction of the Albert Embankment in the late 1860s. The new buildings were designed by Henry Currey and the foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria in 1868. There was a seventh pavilion at the north end of the site next to Westminster Bridge Road for the &quot;Treasurer&#x27;s House&quot; (hospital offices). The hospital initially had 600 beds.

This was one of the first new hospitals to adopt the &quot;pavilion principle&quot; – popularised by Florence Nightingale in her &quot;Notes on Nursing&quot; – by having six separate ward buildings at right angles to the river frontage set 125 feet apart and linked by low corridors. The intention was primarily to improve ventilation and to separate and segregate patients with infectious diseases.

An urban legend suggests that by convention, deaths in the Palace of Westminster are recorded as occurring in St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, because it is technically a royal palace, and as such people who die there would be entitled to a state funeral. This is not true, since state funerals for any person other than a sovereign require an order from the reigning monarch as well as a parliamentary vote to authorise the funding. 

A similar myth suggests that the place of death is changed because a death in a royal palace would require an inquest from the Coroner of the Queen&#x27;s Household and a hearing before a jury of members of the Royal Household. Although the position of Coroner of the Queen&#x27;s Household was abolished by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, in the past the Coroner was responsible for inquests where the victim was &quot;lying within the limits of the Queen&#x27;s palaces&quot;, which would have included the Palace of Westminster. However, there is no proof that deaths at Westminster were ever reported as happening at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital to avoid involving the Coroner. When Sir Alfred Billson died in the House of Commons in 1907, his death was recorded as occurring in the House and not at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. 

The hospital was requisitioned by the War Office in 1914 to create the 5th London General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties.

===Post-war rebuilding===

The northern part of the hospital site was severely damaged during the Second World War, with three ward blocks destroyed. Limited reconstruction began in the 1950s including the building now known as East Wing. Complete rebuilding to a more ambitious plan to designs by Yorke Rosenberg Mardall was agreed on in the 1960s requiring the realignment of Lambeth Palace Road further away from the river to enlarge the hospital campus. The new buildings have white-tiled cladding, which was a characteristic of several other university and hospital buildings designed by that practice.

As construction of the thirteen storey block (now North Wing) was completed by John Laing &amp; Sons in 1975 there was a widespread public reaction against the scale and appearance of this building – most notably from MPs who could see it from the river terrace of the Palace of Westminster. The southern part of the redevelopment, which would have included a second tall block, was never constructed. The three remaining Victorian ward pavilion blocks were refurbished in the 1980s. They are now Grade II listed buildings.

In November 1949, in an operating theatre in St Thomas&#x27; Hospital, Harold Ridley achieved the world&#x27;s first implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL), treating a cataract in a 49-year-old female patient. In later life Ridley himself underwent successful bilateral intraocular lens implantation at St Thomas&#x27;s. What was most pleasing to him was that he had the operation done in the same hospital where he had performed the first operation in 1949. Ridley was subsequently made a Knight Bachelor &quot;for pioneering services to cataracts surgery&quot;.

With the closure of the Dreadnought Seamen&#x27;s Hospital at the Greenwich Hospital in 1986, services for seamen and their families are provided by the Dreadnought Unit at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. It allows eligible merchant seafarers access to priority medical treatment, except cardiac surgery, and is funded by central government with money separate from other NHS trust funds. It originally consisted of two 28-bed wards, but nowadays Dreadnought patients are treated according to clinical need and so are placed in the ward most suitable for their medical condition.

Following the merger of Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; Hospitals into one trust, accident and emergency services were consolidated at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in 1993. Former prime minister Harold Wilson died at the hospital on 24 May 1995, as a result of cancer and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In the late 1980s Dr Chris Aps introduced changes at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital which allowed cardiothoracic surgical patients to recover away from the intensive care unit in an overnight intensive recovery unit: this has become a template for similar units across the United Kingdom. In October 2005 children&#x27;s departments moved to new facilities designed by Michael Hopkins at Evelina London Children&#x27;s Hospital to the south-east of St Thomas&#x27; Hospital.

===Response to COVID-19===

As the situation in Wuhan deteriorated, at the end of January 2020, four hospital trusts in the UK, including St Thomas&#x27; and The Royal Free were put on standby to receive suspected patients.

After testing positive to COVID-19 on 27 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to St Thomas&#x27; on 5 April and as his condition deteriorated, he was moved to intensive care later that day. He was moved out of intensive care on 9 April and discharged 3 days later.

==Facilities==
The current main pedestrian entrance is in Westminster Bridge Road, although there is a separate vehicle and A&amp;E entrance in Lambeth Palace Road; there is also a riverside pedestrian entrance, and the Lane Fox Unit (chronic respiratory problems) has its own riverside entrance, mainly for the use of patients on the Lane Fox Ward. The pedestrian entrance to the campus leads to a glazed link between the Lambeth Wing and the North Wing. Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; Charity commissioned sculptor Rick Kirby to produce a sculpture &quot;&quot;, and this was unveiled in 2000 outside the Main Entrance. To the north of the North Wing (closer to Westminster Bridge Road) there is a garden area above car parking with Naum Gabo&#x27;s fountain sculpture &quot;Revolving Torsion&quot; at its centre.

Tommy&#x27;s is a UK-based charity that funds research into pregnancy problems and provides information to parents. The charity believes that it is unacceptable that one in four women in the UK will lose a baby during pregnancy and birth. It started when two obstetricians working in the maternity unit at the hospital were inspired to start fundraising for more research into pregnancy problems. It funds three research centres in the UK, including St Thomas&#x27; in London, Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Manchester, and the recently established Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.

==Name==
The use of the plural genitive s&#x27; in place of the singular genitive s&#x27;s is fairly recent. The hospital newsletter in 2004 claimed that plural s&#x27; is grammatically correct, as &quot;there are two men called St Thomas linked to the hospital&#x27;s history: Thomas Becket and Thomas the Apostle&quot;. A hospital belonging to two men, both called Thomas, would be Thomases&#x27;, so the name change in the late 20th century is considered by some to be a simple mistake.

Within the South Wing of the hospital there are a number of late Victorian brass plaques headed &quot;St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital&quot; i.e. using singular genitive. However, the medical school used the singular genitive s&#x27;s; the explanation given for this was that as the medical school of the hospital it was called &quot;St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School&quot; (although following this logic it should perhaps have been called &quot;St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s Medical School&quot;).

==Medical training at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital==
St Thomas&#x27;s Hospital Medical School was established in 1550. Following the establishment of Guy&#x27;s Hospital as a separate institution, this continued as a single medical school, commonly known as The Borough Hospitals, with teaching across St Thomas&#x27; and Guy&#x27;s Hospitals. Following a dispute over the successor to the Surgeon Astley Cooper, Guy&#x27;s established its own separate medical school in 1825.

The medical school subsequently remerged in 1982 with that at Guy&#x27;s to form the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; Hospitals (UMDS). Subsequent additions included the Royal Dental Hospital of London School of Dental Surgery joining with Guy&#x27;s Dental School on 1 August 1983 and St John&#x27;s Institute of Dermatology on 1 August 1985. The latter had previously been located at 5 Lisle Street in Soho.

Following discussion held between 1990 and 1992 with King&#x27;s College London and the King&#x27;s College London Act 1997, the UMDS merged in 1998 with King&#x27;s College School of Medicine and Dentistry to form as The Guy&#x27;s, Kings &amp; Thomas&#x27; Schools of Medicine (GKT School of Medicine), of Dentistry and of Biomedical Sciences. This was renamed as King&#x27;s College London School of Medicine and Dentistry at Guy&#x27;s, King&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; Hospitals in 2005.

== Nurse training at St.Thomas&#x27; Hospital ==
The Nightingale Training School and Home for Nurses opened at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital on 9 July 1860 under Matron Sarah Elizabeth Wardroper, endowed from the publicly donated Fund raised after the Crimean War to honour Florence Nightingale. Alicia LLoyd Still (matron of the hospital and superintendent of the training school from 1913 to 1937) created the first post of sister tutor, setting a model internationally. Notable alumini of the training school included: Dorothy Bannon, (Chief Matron-in-Charge of the Hospital and School Nursing Service of the London County Council from 1929 to 1940); Dame Barbara Cozens (Matron-in-Chief and Director of Army Nursing Services from 1960 to 1964), and Theodora Turner (Matron at St. Thomas&#x27; 1955 to 1965 and President of the Royal College of Nursing 1966 to 1968.)

The school merged with other training schools in the 1990s, then became the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery &amp; Palliative Care, part of King&#x27;s College London.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1975 crime film &quot;Brannigan&quot;, interior shots in an office set with a Thames river view constructed on an upper floor in the north-east corner of the (built but not yet commissioned) North Wing stood in for &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; in scenes between John Wayne (Chicago police detective Brannigan) and Richard Attenborough (Metropolitan Police Commander Swann).
* Graham Swift&#x27;s 1996 novel &quot;Last Orders&quot; features several scenes from the hospital where one of the main characters, Jack Dodds, dies from cancer.
* The main building was used as the exterior shot of the fictional Royal Hope Hospital featured in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;.
* The hospital also featured in the 2002 film &quot;28 Days Later&quot; in which the hospital was abandoned due to the nationwide outbreak of a deadly virus which causes its victims to go insane.
* Popular novelist Lucilla Andrews trained as a nurse at St Thomas&#x27; during the Second World War, and her experiences there are recounted in her autobiography &quot;No Time for Romance&quot; as well as being the basis for a series of wartime romances set in a fictional hospital inspired by St Thomas&#x27;.
* The Kinks&#x27; &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; was inspired in part by songwriter Ray Davies&#x27; view over the Thames from St. Thomas while he was a patient there following a tracheotomy at age 13.

<text>In Indiana folklore, the Beast of Busco is an enormous snapping turtle which citizens claimed to have seen in 1949. Despite a month-long hunt that briefly gained national attention, the &quot;Beast of Busco&quot; was never found.

==History==
In 1898, a farmer named Oscar Fulk claimed to have seen a giant turtle living in the seven-acre lake on his farm near Churubusco, Indiana. He told others about it, but eventually he decided to drop the matter.

A half century later, in July 1948, two Churubusco citizens, Ora Blue and Charley Wilson, also reported seeing a huge turtle (weighing an estimated 500 pounds) while fishing on the same lake, which had come to be known as Fulk Lake. A farmer named Gale Harris owned the land at that time. Harris and others also reported seeing the creature. Word spread.

In early 1949, a UPI reporter from Fort Wayne sent the story out on the wire services, and the turtle became nationally famous.

Curious mobs of sightseers began to invade Harris’ land forcing state police to be called in for traffic control.

After many doubted the existence of the turtle, Harris made several attempts to catch the beast, including draining the lake by pumping the water into an area sealed off by a dam with the help of Orville Bright and Kenneth Leitch only for the dam to break when the lake had almost been entirely drained. But despite many attempts, &quot;Oscar&quot; (named after the original owner of the farm) was never captured.

In March 1949, an attempt to send a deep-sea diver into the pond failed when the wrong equipment was delivered to the Harris farm.

A photographer for &quot;Life Magazine&quot;, Mike Shea, took 299 photos at the site, but they were deemed unusable.

==Cultural impact==
Oscar&#x27;s memory lives on in Churubusco&#x27;s Turtle Days festival held each June. It includes a parade, carnival and turtle races.

A turtle shell labeled &quot;Beast of Busco&quot; hangs in the Two Brothers Restaurant in Decatur, Indiana.

A small concrete statue of a turtle sits on the sidewalk at the main intersection in the center of Churubusco.

<text>The Old Operating Theatre Museum and Herb Garret at 9a St Thomas Street is a museum of surgical history and one of the oldest surviving operating theatres. It is located in the garret of St Thomas&#x27;s Church, Southwark, in London, on the original site of St Thomas&#x27; Hospital.

==History==
There is little information about operating theatres at Old St Thomas from its foundation till the 18th century. The church that contains the Old Operating Theatre Museum was built at the end of the 17th century, when the hospital and church were largely rebuilt by Sir Robert Clayton, president of the hospital and a former Lord Mayor of the City of London. He employed Thomas Cartwright, master mason to Christopher Wren at St Mary-Le-Bow, as architect. The new church was fitted out with a large garret constructed in the &#x27;aisled-barn&#x27; tradition. There is very little information about the garret except that it was fitted with wooden storage racks, and was described as &quot;the herb garret&quot; in 1821. Dried heads of opium plants were found in the rafters. It is likely that the garret was used by the hospital&#x27;s resident apothecary to store and cure medicinal herbs.

In 1822 part of the herb garret was converted into a purpose-built operating theatre; previously operations had taken place on the ward. Windows were provided for the garret at the same time, suggesting that its function changed from storage to a working environment. This strange situation was due to the female surgical ward&#x27;s abutting the garret, which may have been used as a recovery ward.

In 1859, Florence Nightingale became involved with St Thomas&#x27;s, setting up on this site her famous nursing school. On her advice the hospital agreed to move to a new site when the Charing Cross Railway Company offered to buy the hospital&#x27;s land. In 1862, the hospital began the move to its present site at Lambeth, and the operating theatre was closed, lying undiscovered until 1957.

===Use===
The patients were mainly poor people who were expected to contribute to their care if they could afford it. Rich patients were treated and operated on at home rather than in hospital. The patients at the old operating theatre were all women.

Until 1847, surgeons had no recourse to anaesthetics and depended on swift technique (surgeons could perform an amputation in a minute or less), the mental preparation of the patient, and alcohol or opiates to dull the patient&#x27;s senses. Thereafter, ether or chloroform started to be used. The operating theatre had closed down before antiseptic surgery was developed. The majority of cases were for amputations or superficial complaints as, without antiseptic conditions, it was too dangerous to do internal operations.

A description of the students packing the theatre to witness an operation was left by a St Thomas surgeon, John Flint South:

Patients put up with the audience, to their distress, because they received medical treatment from some of the best surgeons in the land, which otherwise they could not afford. Wealthy patients of the surgeons would have been operated on, by choice, at home, probably on the kitchen table.

The risk of death at the hands of a surgeon was greatly increased by the lack of understanding of the causes of infection. Although cleanliness was a moral virtue, descriptions suggest that a surgeon was as likely to wash his hands after an operation as before. The old frock coats worn by surgeons during operations were, according to a contemporary, &#x27;stiff and stinking with pus and blood&#x27;. Beneath the table was a sawdust box for collecting blood. The death rate was further heightened by the shock of the operation, and because operations took place as a last resort, patients tended to have few reserves of strength.

==Modern museum ==
In 1962, after 100 years of disuse, the garret and operating theatre were opened to the public as the current museum. The museum consists of:

* The oldest surviving operating theatre in the UK (dating from 1822), used in the days before anaesthetics and antiseptic surgery
* The herb garret used by the hospital&#x27;s apothecary to store and cure herbs used in healing
* A collection of artefacts revealing the horrors of medicine before the age of science, including instruments for cupping, bleeding, trepanning, and childbirth
* Displays on medieval monastic health care; the history of St Thomas&#x27;s, Guy&#x27;s Hospital and Evelina Children&#x27;s Hospital; Florence Nightingale and nursing; and medical and herbal medicine

The museum is a member of the London Museums of Health &amp; Medicine.

The building is listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England.

A nearby London Underground and National Rail station is London Bridge.

<text>The Saint Mary&#x27;s Huskies are the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic teams that represent Saint Mary&#x27;s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Their primary home turf is Huskies Stadium, located in the centre of the university&#x27;s campus.

In September 2007, Saint Mary&#x27;s announced the plans to build the new Homburg Centre for Health &amp; Wellness, that will comprise the current gymnasium (The Tower), the new Dauphinee Arena, and a new building to connect the two. The centre is to be named after Richard Homburg, who provided a $5 million gift to the project, the largest gift the university has received in its 205-year history. The Dauphinee Arena, completed in 2019, has an NHL-sized ice surface and a seating capacity of 875. The arena is named for the late Mr. Bob Dauphinee, who was a strong supporter of the Huskies hockey team for over 50 years. Upon his death in 2001, Mr. Dauphinee left an estate gift to the university of $2.1 million.

The football team plays at Princess Auto Stadium, the soccer team plays at the outdoor soccer field on campus, track and field teams use University Stadium, and the volleyball and basketball teams play at Investors Group Athletic Centre. The University has 18 different teams in 10 sports: basketball, curling, cross country running, Canadian football, golf, ice hockey, soccer, swimming, track &amp; field, and volleyball.

==Varsity sports==
===Ice hockey===
====Men&#x27;s ice hockey====

The Bisons iced a junior ice hockey team in the Manitoba Junior Hockey League. The Bisons won four consecutive Turnbull Cups as Manitoba junior champions in 1922, 1923, 1924, and 1925.

The 1923 Bisons team won the Allan Cup, Memorial Cup and Abbott Cup, and were inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in 2023. The roster included J.A. Wise (Forward), C.E. Williams (Sub Forward), C.S. Doupe (Sub Goal), F. Robertson (Sub Defence), R.E. Moulden (Forward), A.I. Chapman (Defence), Blake Watson (Forward), Murray Murdoch (Captain &amp; Centre), A.T. Puttee (Goal), J. Mitchell (Forward), A. Johnson (Defence), S.B. Field (Secretary/Treasurer), R.L. Bruce (Manager), H. Andrews (President), Hal Moulden (Coach), Walter Robertson (Trainer).

The school&#x27;s senior ice hockey team won the 1931 World Ice Hockey Championships playing as the University of Manitoba Grads, and were inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame in the team category. The roster included Sammy McCallum, Gordon MacKenzie, Blake Watson, Art Puttee, Frank Morris, George Hill, Ward McVey, Jack Pidcock, Guy &quot;Weary&quot; Williamson.

In December 1934, the university appealed to W. A. Fry and the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada regarding a decision by the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA) which did not require university students be released from a private club team to play for the school team. Fry agreed with the university, stating that students are under the jurisdiction of the school unless released by the school to play for a club team. He also stated that AAU of C rulings should be respected by affiliated organizations, such as the MAHA.

The 1965 Bisons won the David Johnston University Cup as the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union champions, and were also inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.

<text>A work song is a piece of music closely connected to a form of work, either one sung while conducting a task (usually to coordinate timing) or one linked to a task that may be a connected narrative, description, or protest song. An example is &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working on the Railroad&quot;.

==Definitions and categories==
Records of work songs are as old as historical records, and anthropological evidence suggests that most agrarian societies tend to have them. 

When defining work songs, most modern commentators include songs that are sung while working, as well as songs that are &quot;about&quot; work or have work as the main subject, since the two categories are often interconnected. Norm Cohen divided collected work songs into the following categories: domestic, agricultural or pastoral, sea shanties, African-American work songs, songs and chants of direction, and street cries. Ted Gioia built on these categories by dividing agricultural and pastoral songs into subsections: hunting, cultivation and herding songs. Gioia also highlighted the industrial or proto-industrial songs of cloth workers (see Waulking song), factory workers, seamen, longshoremen, mechanics, plumbers, electricians, lumberjacks, cowboys and miners. He also added prisoner songs and modern work songs.

===Hunting and pastoral songs===
In societies without mechanical timekeeping, songs for mobilisation–calling members of a community together for a collective task–were extremely important. Both hunting and the keeping of livestock tended to involve small groups or individuals, usually boys and young men, who would spend long hours working, away from the centers of settlement. As a result, these activities tended to produce long narrative songs, often sung individually, which might dwell on the themes of pastoral activity or animals, designed to pass the time in the tedium of work. 

Hunting songs, such as those of the Mbuti of the Congo, often incorporated distinctive whistles and yodels so that hunters could identify each other&#x27;s locations and the locations of their prey.

===Agricultural work songs===
Most agricultural work songs were rhythmic, a cappella songs intended to increase productivity while reducing feelings of boredom. Rhythms of work songs, similar to an African drum beat, served to synchronize physical movement in groups, coordinating sowing, hoeing, and harvesting. The usage of verses in work songs were sometimes improvised and sung differently each time. Improvisation provided singers with a subversive form of expression. Enslaved people sang improvised verses to mock their overseers, express frustrations, and share dreams of escaping. Many work songs served to create connection and familiarity between workers.

Yankee Doodle is thought to have started out as a harvest song, its words possibly originating from farmers in 15th century Holland. It contained mostly nonsensical and out-of-place words that were presumably sung to a similar—if not the same—tune: &quot;Yanker, didel, doodle down, Diddle, dudel, lanther, Yanke viver, voover vown, &quot;Botermilk&quot; und &quot;tanther&quot;.&quot; Farm laborers in Holland at the time received as their wages &quot;as much buttermilk (&quot;Botermilk&quot;) as they could drink, and a tenth (&quot;tanther&quot;) of the grain&quot;.

===African-American work songs===
African-American work songs originally developed in the era of slavery, between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. Because they were part of an almost entirely oral culture, they had no fixed form and only began to be recorded as the era of slavery came to an end after 1865. Slave Songs of the United States was the first collection of African-American &quot;slave songs.&quot; It was published in 1867 by William Francis Allen, Charles Pickard Ware, and Lucy McKim Garrison. Though this text included many songs by slaves, other texts have also been published that include work songs. Many songs sung by slaves have their origins in African song traditions, and may have been sung to remind the Africans of home, while others were instituted by the captors to raise morale and keep Africans working in rhythm. They have also been seen as a means of withstanding hardship and expressing anger and frustration through creativity or covert verbal opposition. Similarly, work songs have been used as a form of rebellion and resistance. Specifically, African-American women work songs have a particular history and center on resistance and self-care. Work songs helped to pass down information about the lived experience of enslaved people to their communities and families.

A common feature of African-American songs was the &quot;call-and-response&quot; format, where a leader would sing a verse or verses and the others would respond with a chorus. This came from African traditions of agricultural work song and found its way into the spirituals that developed once Africans in bondage began to convert to Christianity and from there to both gospel music and the blues. The call and response format showcases the ways in which work songs foster dialogue. The importance of dialogue is illuminated in many African-American traditions and continues on to the present day. Particular to the African call and response tradition is the overlapping of the call and response. The leader&#x27;s part might overlap with the response, thus creating a unique collaborative sound. Similarly, African-American folk and traditional music focuses on polyphony rather than a melody with a harmony. Often, there will be multiple rhythmic patterns used in the same song &quot;resulting in a counterpoint of rhythms.&quot; The focus on polyphony also allows for improvisation, a component that is crucial to African-American work songs. As scholar Tilford Brooks writes, &quot;improvisation is utilized extensively in Black folk songs, and it is an essential element especially in songs that employ the call-and-response pattern.&quot; Brooks also notes that often in a work song, &quot;the leader has license to improvise on the melody in [their] call, while the response usually repeats its basic melody line without change.&quot; Also evident were field hollers, shouts, and moans, which may have been originally designed for different bands or individuals to locate each other and narrative songs that used folk tales and folk motifs, often making use of homemade instruments. In early African captivity drums were used to provide rhythm, but they were banned in later years because of the fear that Africans would use them to communicate in a rebellion; nevertheless, Africans managed to generate percussion and percussive sounds, using other instruments or their own bodies. In the 1950s, there are very few examples of work songs linked to cotton picking.

Corn, however, was a very common subject of work songs on a typical plantation. Because the crop was the main component of most Africans&#x27; diet, they would often sing about it regardless of whether it was being harvested. Often, communities in the south would hold &quot;corn-shucking jubilees,&quot; during which an entire community of planters would gather on one plantation. The planters would bring their harvests, as well as their enslaved workers, and work such as shucking corn, rolling logs, or threshing rice would be done, accompanied by the singing of Africans doing work. The following is an example of a song Africans would sing as they approached one of these festivals. It is from ex bonded African William Wells Brown&#x27;s memoir &quot; My Southern Home.&quot;

Work songs were used by African-American railroad work crews in the southern United States before modern machinery became available in the 1960s. Anne Kimzey of the Alabama Center For Traditional Culture writes: &quot;All-black gandy dancer crews used songs and chants as tools to help accomplish specific tasks and to send coded messages to each other so as not to be understood by the foreman and others. The lead singer, or caller, would chant to his crew, for example, to realign a rail to a certain position. His purpose was to uplift his crew, both physically and emotionally, while seeing to the coordination of the work at hand. It took a skilled, sensitive caller to raise the right chant to fit the task at hand and the mood of the men. Using tonal boundaries and melodic style typical of the blues, each caller had his own signature. The effectiveness of a caller to move his men has been likened to how a preacher can move a congregation.&quot;

Another common type of African-American work song was the &quot;boat song.&quot; Sung by slaves who had the job of rowing, this type of work song is characterized by &quot;plaintive, melancholy singing.&quot; These songs were not somber because the work was more troublesome than the work of harvesting crops. Rather, they were low-spirited so that they could maintain the slow, steady tempo needed for rowing. In this way, work songs followed the African tradition, emphasizing the importance of activities being accompanied by the appropriate song.

The historian Sylviane Diouf and ethnomusicologist Gerhard Kubik identify Islamic music as an influence on field holler music. Diouf notes a striking resemblance between the Islamic call to prayer (originating from Bilal ibn Rabah, a famous Abyssinian African Muslim in the early 7th century) and 19th-century field holler music, noting that both have similar lyrics praising God, melody, note changes, &quot;words that seem to quiver and shake&quot; in the vocal cords, dramatic changes in musical scales, and nasal intonation. She attributes the origins of field holler music to African Muslim slaves who accounted for an estimated 30% of African slaves in America. According to Kubik, &quot;the vocal style of many blues singers using melisma, wavy intonation, and so forth is a heritage of that large region of West Africa that had been in contact with the Arabic-Islamic world of the Maghreb since the seventh and eighth centuries.&quot; There was particularly a significant trans-Saharan cross-fertilization between the musical traditions of the Maghreb and the Sahel.

===Sea shanties===

Work songs sung by sailors between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries are known as sea shanties. These songs were typically performed while adjusting the rigging, raising anchor, and other tasks where men would need to pull in rhythm. These songs usually have a very punctuated rhythm precisely for this reason, along with a &quot;call-and-answer&quot; format. Well before the nineteenth century, sea songs were common on rowing vessels. Such songs were also very rhythmic in order to keep the rowers together. Because many cultures used slaves to row, some of these songs might also be considered slave songs. Improvised verses sung by sailors spoke of ills with work conditions and captains. These songs were performed with and without the aid of a drum.

===Cowboy songs===

Western music was directly influenced by the folk music traditions of immigrants in the nineteenth century as they moved west. They reflected the realities of the range and ranch houses where the music originated, played a major part in combating the loneliness and boredom that characterised cowboy life and western life in general. Such songs were often accompanied on portable instruments of guitars, fiddles, concertina and harmonica. In the nineteenth century cowboy bands developed and cowboy songs began to be collected and published from the early twentieth century with books like John Lomax&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads&quot; (1910). As cowboys were romanticised in the mid-twentieth century they became extremely popular and played a part in the development of country and western music.

===Industrial folk song===

Industrial folk song emerged in Britain in the eighteenth century, as workers took the forms of music with which they were familiar, including ballads and agricultural work songs, and adapted them to their new experiences and circumstances. Unlike agricultural work songs, it was often unnecessary to use music to synchronise actions between workers, as the pace would be increasingly determined by water, steam, chemical and eventually electric power, and frequently impossible because of the noise of early industry.

As a result, industrial folk songs tended to be descriptive of work, circumstances, or political in nature, making them amongst the earliest protest songs and were sung between work shifts or in leisure hours, rather than during work. This pattern can be seen in textile production, mining and eventually steel, shipbuilding, rail working and other industries. As other nations industrialised their folk song underwent a similar process of change, as can be seen for example in France, where Saint-Simon noted the rise of &#x27;Chansons Industriale&#x27; among cloth workers in the early nineteenth century, and in the USA where industrialisation expanded rapidly after the Civil War.

A.L. Lloyd defined the industrial work song as &#x27;the kind of vernacular songs made by workers themselves directly out of their own experiences, expressing their own interest and aspirations...&#x27;. Lloyd also pointed to various types of song, including chants of labour, love and erotic occupational songs and industrial protest songs, which included narratives of disasters (particularly among miners), laments for conditions, as well as overtly political strike ballads. He also noted the existence of songs about heroic and mythical figures of industrial work, like the coal miners the &#x27;Big Hewer&#x27; or &#x27;Big Isaac&#x27; Lewis.

This tendency was even more marked in early American industrial songs, where representative heroes like Casey Jones and John Henry were eulogised in blues ballads from the nineteenth century. 

=== Folk revival ===
In the 1930s, Lead Belly (Huddie Ledbetter) was recorded in prison by the folklorist Alan Lomax. Lead Belly knew hundreds of work hollers and traditional songs from the cotton fields, railroads and prison gangs. In the 1940s he toured widely on college campuses and folk music venues, popularising songs including &quot;Take This Hammer&quot;, &quot;John Henry&quot; &quot;Boll Weevil&quot; and &quot;Midnight Special&quot;. His repertoire was a major influence on the Folk Revival of the 1950s and 1960s. Mining songs written in the late 1940s by country artists Merle Travis (&quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; and &quot;Dark as a Dungeon&quot;) and Billy Edd Wheeler (&quot;Coal Tattoo&quot;) also became fireside standards. 

The working class was glorified in Marxist theory and practice, and a strong link between work songs and activism developed in the USA and elsewhere. The &quot;dustbowl balladeer&quot; Woody Guthrie wrote and performed work-related songs such as &quot;Deportee&quot; and &quot;Talking Hard Work&quot; in the 1940s and 1950s. Guthrie and other politically active performers, especially the Weavers with Pete Seeger, continued the Union Songs movement that had begun with Joe Hill in the early 1900s. From that time, most topical and activist singers including Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs performed work-related songs. Rock performers with working-class leanings such as Bruce Springsteen have also been influenced by the genre.

In Britain, Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger produced hundreds of albums of political and traditional songs, writing many songs referring to industrial and working conditions. Folk or folk-rock performers including Steeleye Span, Fairport Convention, The Watersons, Dick Gaughan, Capercaillie, Billy Bragg, James Fagan and Nancy Kerr have featured work songs in their performances. 

In Australia, shearing songs and droving songs featured strongly in the first traditional songs to be collected in the field in the 1950s. Merv Lilley and Dorothy Hewett wrote work poems that were set to music during the early 1960s folk revival and became standards, such as the call-and-reply canecutting song &quot;Cane Killed Abel&quot; and one of the first songs about the social and environmental damage caused by industrialisation, &quot;Weevils in the Flour&quot;. Alternative rock bands like Midnight Oil and Goanna passed the tradition to a broader audience.

With the end of the folk boom in the 1970s and the rise of the introspective singer-songwriter, the genre lost its wide public appeal, but work songs have continued to be very popular throughout the folk scene, at protest gatherings and with union choirs.

=== Women&#x27;s work songs ===
Waulking songs from Scotland are a traditional genre performed while women communally beat and felted cloth. 

Some women&#x27;s work songs have been created within modern genres. Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Nine to Five&quot; is pop country; Cher&#x27;s &quot;Working Girl&quot; is also an office work anthem. Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;She Works Hard for the Money&quot; is disco/techno and refers to &quot;the oldest profession&quot; (prostitution).

<text>Parliament Hill School is a secondary school for girls with a mixed sixth form located in the Borough of Camden in London, England. In 2013, there were 1,250 students on roll, between the ages of 11 and 18.

==History==
===Grammar school===
The school is the former Parliament Hill Grammar School. The school was damaged during World War II, on one occasion losing 700 windows in a single night, although no bombs directly hit it. During the war, pupils occasionally had lessons in air raid shelters and staff kept a daily list of girls whose homes had been bombed the night before to ensure that they would not be punished for incomplete homework.

===Comprehensive===
It became a comprehensive in 1957.

In 1999, Parliament Hill School become one of the first schools to introduce a cashless catering system, which they did an attempt to prevent dinner money being stolen by bullies.

In November 2019, staff and students at the school underwent screenings for tuberculosis after five cases were found among the students.

In March 2021, students at the school held a protest after the school held a “shamefully insensitive and inadequate” presentation about sexual assault which promoted the NotAllMen hashtag and advised students to wear modest clothing to prevent being raped.

==Location and facilities==
The school is located on the edge of Hampstead Heath and comprises a combination of both modern and traditional buildings.

In January 2014, the school unveiled plans for a £19 million redevelopment of the school, encompassing the construction of two new buildings to replace a number of the older ones. The new buildings are designed to be environmentally friendly, incorporating a number of features to reduce carbon emissions. The new development will include a new sixth form centre for students at the LaSWAP Sixth Form.

==Academic performance==

Parliament Hill School was rated &#x27;Good&#x27; overall by Ofsted inspectors in 2013, with behaviour and safety of students and leadership and management rated &#x27;Outstanding&#x27;. The number of students achieving five or more A*–C grades including English and Maths in 2013 was 67%, 14 percentage points higher than the national average.

Students at the school come from a wide range of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, and almost half of students speak English as an additional language. The majority of students move on to the LaSWAP Sixth Form following completion of their GCSE courses.

The school has Investors in People accreditation and participates in the London Excellence in Work Experience Scheme.

==Sixth Form==
The school is part of the LaSWAP Sixth Form consortium, along with the neighbouring schools La Sainte Union Catholic School, William Ellis School and Acland Burghley School. There were 1,266 students on roll in 2013. 79% of students achieved three or more A Level qualifications in 2013.

<text>A Speakers&#x27; Corner is an area where free speech open-air public speaking, debate, and discussion are allowed. The original and best known is in the north-east corner of Hyde Park in London, England. Historically there were a number of other areas designated as Speakers&#x27; Corners in other parks in London, such as Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields, Finsbury Park, Clapham Common, Kennington Park, and Victoria Park. Areas for Speakers&#x27; Corners have been established in other countries and elsewhere in the UK.

==Hyde Park==


Speakers here may talk on any subject, as long as the police consider their speeches lawful, although this right is not restricted to Speakers&#x27; Corner only. Contrary to popular belief, there is no immunity from the law, nor are any subjects proscribed, but in practice the police intervene only when they receive a complaint. On some occasions in the past, they have intervened on grounds of profanity.

Though Hyde Park Speakers&#x27; Corner is considered the paved area closest to Marble Arch, legally the public speaking area extends beyond the Reform Tree and covers a large area from Marble Arch to Victoria Gate, then along the Serpentine to Hyde Park Corner and the Broad Walk running from Hyde Park Corner to Marble Arch.

Public riots broke out in the park in 1855, in protest over the Sunday Trading Bill, which forbade buying and selling on a Sunday, the only day working people had off. The riots were described by Karl Marx as &quot;the beginning of the English revolution&quot;.

The Chartist movement used Hyde Park as a point of assembly for popular protests, but no permanent speaking location was established. The Reform League organised a massive demonstration in 1866 and then again in 1867, which compelled the government to extend the franchise to include most working-class men.

Speakers&#x27; Corner is often held up to demonstrate freedom of speech, as anyone can turn up unannounced and talk on almost any subject, although always at the risk of being heckled by regulars. The corner was frequented by Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, George Orwell, C. L. R. James, Walter Rodney, Ben Tillett, Marcus Garvey, Kwame Nkrumah, and William Morris.

In June 1972, three Irish republican activists, Joseph Callinan, Louis Marcantonio and Thomas Quinn, were arrested after giving inflammatory speeches at Speaker&#x27;s Corner in Hyde Park protesting the events of Bloody Sunday, in which British troops opened fire on a crowd of civil rights demonstrators in Derry, killing 13. The three men were subsequently charged under the Treason Felony Act 1848 with criminal conspiracy and incitement. Most of the charges were eventually dropped, and the three were ultimately convicted of sedition and given sentences of between nine and eighteen months in prison.

Lord Justice Sedley, in &quot;Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions&quot; (1999), described Speakers&#x27; Corner as demonstrating &quot;the tolerance which is both extended by the law to opinion of every kind and expected by the law in the conduct of those who disagree, even strongly, with what they hear.&quot; The ruling famously established in English case law that freedom of speech could not be limited to the inoffensive but extended also to &quot;the irritating, the contentious, the eccentric, the heretical, the unwelcome, and the provocative, as long as such speech did not tend to provoke violence&quot;, and that the right to free speech accorded by Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights also accorded the right to be offensive. Prior to the ruling, prohibited speech at Speakers&#x27; Corner included obscenity, blasphemy, insulting the Monarch, or inciting a breach of the peace.

==Outside London==

===Official===
====Southampton====
Speakers Corner Southampton opened in 1971, as a council tactic to obstruct those who had already started one on the newly pedestrianised High Street. No disruption was caused, but it appeared that Labour Party councillors wanted no one to their left to have a public voice, using the excuse that the pedestrianised area was legally a Highway. Five speakers were arrested the first Saturday, with more as protests grew in subsequent weeks; all were tried and given conditional discharges by rightwing city magistrates. Subsequently, as a secondrate sop, the local council built the present isolated corner in a park several hundred metres away, with it first being used on the 27 November 1971 by an anti apartheid group.

====Nottingham====
Speakers&#x27; Corner Nottingham was officially inaugurated by Jack Straw, the UK Justice Secretary, on 22 February 2009. The designated space occupied a new landscaped extension to the city&#x27;s Old Market Square, at the junction of King Street and Queen Street. The large paved space includes the new statue of Brian Clough, the former manager of Derby County and Nottingham Forest, who forged ties between the two cities which were famous for local rivalry.

====Lichfield, Staffordshire====

Speakers Corner Lichfield was launched in May 2009, with the help of the Speakers&#x27; Corner Trust, to much applause. Hundreds of people joined in the celebrations which featured more than 30 speeches, musical and dance performances, as well as star appearances from BBC&#x27;s Jo Malin and former &quot;Coronation Street&quot; star Chris Walker.

Today Speakers&#x27; Corner is a site for events and activities, as well as a destination for all the community to visit and have their say on topics close to their hearts.

Since the launch, a plaque has been unveiled at the site, along with a code of conduct. Plans for the site include a stone plaque marking the spot, as well as a series of annual events.

====Worthing, West Sussex====
The Sussex coastal town of Worthing has had its own Speakers&#x27; Corner at Splash Point on the town&#x27;s seafront since the Victorian era. A sign today marks the &quot;stand for delivering sermons and public speeches&quot;, while another sign close by marks the site by the old Fish Market where the Salvation Army has preached the Gospel since 1886. The Speakers&#x27; Corner fell into disuse in the late 20th century. As part of the Government&#x27;s &quot;Sea Change&quot; programme, run by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, the area benefited from a £500,000 grant to re-landscape the area around Splash Point including a revival of the Speakers&#x27; Corner. Work was completed early in 2011

===Unofficial===

====Leeds====
Leeds is known to have its own Speakers&#x27; Corner, at Victoria Gardens on the Headrow, in front of the Leeds City Art Gallery, Central Library and Henry Moore Sculpture Centre building. It is a pivotal point in Leeds for justice and anti-war marches, most of which gather and terminate here, as well as for war memorial services due to the location of Leeds&#x27;s Municipal Cenotaph.

==== Newcastle ====
The stepped base of Grey&#x27;s Monument is used as a stage by assorted musicians, preachers and activists.

==== Portsmouth ====
The steps of Guildhall, Portsmouth are often used for protest activity, speeches and activists.

==Other countries==

===Australia===
There is a Speakers&#x27; Corner in The Domain, Sydney, established in 1878. The speakers talk every Sunday afternoon from 2 pm until 5 pm, and have a website. Official outdoor &quot;free&quot; speech first appeared in the hustings and hanging grounds of Hyde Park Sydney in 1874. Free speech in this form was banned following a serious riot between Catholics and Orangemen. However, following the formalisation of free speech in Speakers&#x27; Corner in London it was decided in 1878 that The Domain would be the place for free speech in Sydney.

In &quot;Diary of a Voyage to Australia, New Zealand and other lands&quot; (published 1896), the Christadelphian preacher Robert Roberts wrote: &quot;On the west side [of a particular location] is a feature peculiar to Sydney in all the world - a preaching park. There are of course, parks in other cities where open-air spouting is practiced on Sundays, such as Hyde Park, in London : but there is no city in the world where a park on such a scale is used by all classes of religious people. It is a wooded enclosure, like a nobleman&#x27;s park in England, kept in capital order, both as regards the turf under foot, and the tall and noble trees that give shelter overhead from the sun.&quot; &quot;All the sects and denominations use it. There is none of the sense of infra dig that associates itself with out-door preaching in England.&quot;&quot;Every denomination has its own tree.&quot; &quot;The various religious bodies hold their meetings sufficiently apart to make no interference one with the other. It is a sort of weekly babel of religious tongues - recognised and patronised by the whole community&quot;

Other Speakers&#x27; Corners are found in Brisbane outside Parliament House, and in King George Square. In Melbourne, Speakers&#x27; Corner was originally held in Birrarung Marr where the original site is still visible. This site has lost some popularity over the years and Speakers&#x27; Corner (Now called &quot;Speakers&#x27; Forum&quot;) is currently held outside the State Library of Victoria on Sunday afternoon from 3 pm.

===Canada===

Dedicated by the Earl Mountbatten on 12 April 1966, Speakers&#x27; Corner in Regina, Saskatchewan is located on the north shore of Wascana Lake. It serves as a constant reminder of the notion of free speech and assembly and a tribute to Saskatchewan people who have upheld that heritage. The two lanterns framing the south entrance to the main plaza formed part of the Cumberland Screen at the entrance to Speakers&#x27; Corner in London. The podia on the main plaza are from the exterior columns of the Old City Hall (1908–1965) and symbolise free speech in democracy at the municipal level of government. Six paper birch trees were taken from Runnymede Meadow in Windsor Great Park, near Windsor Castle. It was there that King John signed Magna Carta on 15 June 1215. The ten gas lamps surrounding the corner come from King Charles Street which runs from Whitehall to St. James Park, London, near the Houses of Parliament. They were erected in 1908 during the reign of Edward VII, whose royal cypher E.R. VII appears on the base of each lamp.

Kitchener, Ontario has a small area designated as Speakers&#x27; Corner on the northwest corner of King and Benton Street. It has existed since the mid-1980s.

=== Hong Kong ===
The City Forum, a public forum was held weekly on Sunday in Victoria Park&#x27;s Bandstand. The forum brought together politicians, academics and prominent public figures to discuss current issues, and also allowed the public to participate in a Q&amp;A session. Each week, a number of secondary schools were invited to bring pupils to the forum to ask questions. The forum was broadcast live on RTHK TV 31 and was also sometimes held in other locations across Hong Kong such as Centenary Garden and Morse Park as well as across different university campuses. The forum ended on 18 July 2021.

=== Indonesia ===
Mass demonstration and speeches are traditionally held on the Hotel Indonesia roundabout Selamat Datang Monument. This venue however, is located the middle of Jakarta&#x27;s main boulevard and commercial district, thus causing a severe traffic jam when a rally is held. To accommodate this, Jakarta&#x27;s provincial government built a small park on the northwestern corner of the Merdeka Square, across the Istana Merdeka, Indonesia&#x27;s presidential palace. Officially named &#x27;Taman Pandang Istana&#x27; (Palace-View Park), this park is known commonly as &#x27;Taman Unjuk Rasa&#x27; (Demonstration Park).

===Italy===
As a tribute to democracy and freedom of speech, in Lajatico, Pisa, there a small area designated as Speakers&#x27; Corner (&quot;L&#x27;angolo del parlatore&quot;) on a corner of the Vittorio Veneto main square. It is opened for the public to speak on Sundays (9 to 11 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m.). The first speaker was the mayor Alessio Barbarfieri, who highlighted the importance of the acts of speaking and listening for a good and effective local governance.

===Malaysia===
The first Speakers&#x27; Square in Malaysia was established at the Esplanade, George Town, Penang on 4 May 2010. It is opened for the public to speak on Wednesday and Sunday (6.00 pm to 10.00 pm). The first speaker was Tan Seng Hai who shared his views on preventing Ascot Sports Sdn. Bhd. from conducting betting activities in the Penang state.

Conditions for use of Speakers&#x27; Square
* All speakers are prohibited from using loudspeakers, megaphones, or any other public address system
* Anyone who uses the Speakers&#x27; Square to make speeches does so at his or her own risk
* The Penang State Government and the City Council of Penang Island will not be responsible for any prosecution or legal action by the Police or civil proceedings

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, there is a permanently designated speakers&#x27; corner called the Spreeksteen in Amsterdam. Lawfully, every person has the freedom of speech as a matter of right. The &#x27;Spreeksteen&#x27; is open for free speech 24-hours a day, and was established to allow complete free speech. The &#x27;Spreeksteen&#x27; has been located in the Oosterpark in Amsterdam since 5 May 2005, and has been erected by a citizens action after the brutal murder of film-maker and columnist Theo van Gogh. Plans for bringing the Amsterdam Speakers&#x27; Corner online with a permanent camera and microphone are in a phase of installation. In the meantime the speakers are filmed with a hand-held camera.

On 1 October 2006, Michiel Smit, a far-right activist, spoke at the Spreeksteen. Antifascist demonstrators counter-protested, using noise to disrupt the speech. 

===New Zealand===

There is a Speakers&#x27; Corner in Albert Park in Auckland at Princes Street, opposite to the University of Auckland.

===Singapore===

The Speakers&#x27; Corner in Singapore was opened on 1 September 2000, to allow Singapore citizens to speak freely. They are exempted from the need to obtain a police permit as long as they meet the terms and conditions of use.

The Speakers&#x27; Corner is located in Hong Lim Park, a popular venue for many election rallies and political speeches in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. Hong Lim Park is centrally located, well-served by public transport and is sited in a high public density area.

In 2004, public exhibitions and performances were added to the list of exempted activities at the Speakers&#x27; Corner.

From 1 September 2008, Singapore citizens can also organise or participate in demonstrations at Speakers&#x27; Corner without having to obtain a police permit. With this latest change in policy to allow the venue to be used freely as an outdoor demonstration site, coupled with the liberalisation on the use of sound amplification and the extension of operating hours of the venue, the Speakers&#x27; Corner aims to address the genuine desire by some Singaporeans for lawful outdoor demonstrations and processions as a means of political expression.

Singapore citizens who wish to hold a speech, exhibition/performance or demonstration at the Speakers&#x27; Corner can register with the National Parks Board, which manages Hong Lim Park. Online registration is available on the website.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
Woodford Square in Port of Spain, Trinidad, is also known as &quot;The University of Woodford Square&quot;, so named by the first prime minister of Trinidad Eric Williams, who gave many speeches here. Another nickname, &quot;People&#x27;s Parliament&quot;, comes from the Black Power movement of the 1970s. Flanked by Trinidad&#x27;s Parliament and Halls of Justice the Square still plays host to speeches of a highly topical and political nature.

In the southeast corner of the square, a blackboard lists the day&#x27;s discussion as well as other important information. The speakers&#x27; topics are divided by interest and known as &quot;classes&quot;.

===Thailand===
An area was set up in Bangkok in the 1930s, and quickly became known as Hyde Park, to enable freedom of speech and the airing of political views in Thailand. The area was shut down after student rioting and the lethal intervention of the army and it is not discussed openly today.

In 1955, Marshal Plaek Pibulsonggram had visited London as part of an international tour. He became impressed with the &quot;Speakers&#x27; Corner&quot; in Hyde Park. Upon his return to Thailand a &quot;Hyde Park&quot; space for free speech and assembly was instituted at the Phramane Grounds in Bangkok. The experiment was well received and effectively stimulated political debate. The experiment was not appreciated by the government though, and in February 1956 restrictions were imposed on the Phramane &quot;Hyde Park&quot;. However, during this period the Hyde Park Movement Party had evolved, upholding the legacy of the Hyde Park experiment.

=== United States ===
Tom L. Johnson, the radical reforming Mayor of Cleveland (1901–1909), dedicated the north-west quadrant of Public Square to free speech, as in Hyde Park. Speeches and meetings there were common in the early part of the century; Anarchist Emma Goldman addressed a large crowd there in 1908. Today the site remains the traditional place for rallies and demonstrations in Cleveland, around Mayor Johnson&#x27;s statue.

The University of California at Berkeley had a free speech area in front of Sproul Plaza until 1964. The University of Missouri hosts a Speaker&#x27;s Corner, referred to as &quot;Speaker&#x27;s Circle&quot;. There are only two such locations in the entire state of Missouri.

As a result of winter semesters visits to England and Hyde Park, Elon University created a Speakers&#x27; Corner on campus. No persons from outside the university may speak without a permit. Students are free to speak at any time as long as they don&#x27;t use amplification, do not disrupt others, do not damage property and do not cause dangerous conditions.

Bughouse Square in Washington Square Park, Chicago, was known as a free speech site from the 1910s to the 1960s.

The pedestrian-only area of Pennsylvania Avenue on the north side of the White House in Washington, D.C. has become a de facto speaker&#x27;s corner. Consistent with the principles of the First Amendment, ad hoc public speaking is generally legal in all public places in Washington DC, although organized demonstrations require police permits.

Inspired by Speakers&#x27; Corner, Karl Dean, the Mayor of Nashville, designated a space for live music in the southwest corner of Centennial Park (Nashville), calling it Musicians Corner. A free concert series of the same name takes place in this space each year.

<text>The Sukhoi Su-24 (NATO reporting name: Fencer) is a supersonic, all-weather tactical bomber developed in the Soviet Union. The aircraft has a variable-sweep wing, twin engines and a side-by-side seating arrangement for its crew of two. It was the first of the USSR&#x27;s aircraft to carry an integrated digital navigation/attack system. 

The Su-24 started development in the early 1960s and first flew in 1967. It entered service in 1974 and production ceased in 1993. It remains in service with the Russian Aerospace Forces, Syrian Air Force, Ukrainian Air Force, Algerian Air Force and various other air forces to which it was exported.

==Development==

===Background===
One of the conditions for accepting the Sukhoi Su-7B into service in 1961 was the requirement for Sukhoi to develop an all-weather variant capable of precision air strikes. Preliminary investigations with &quot;S-28&quot; and &quot;S-32&quot; aircraft revealed that the basic Su-7 design was too small to contain all the avionics required for the mission. OKB-794 (later known as Leninets) was tasked with developing an advanced nav/attack system, codenamed &quot;Puma&quot;, which would be at the core of the new aircraft. That same year, the United States proposal for their new all-weather strike fighter would be the TFX. The resulting F-111 would introduce a variable-geometry wing for greatly increased payload, range, and low-level penetration capabilities.

In 1962–1963, Sukhoi initially set out to build an aircraft without the complexity of moving wings like the F-111. It designed and built a mockup of S-6, a delta wing aircraft powered by two Tumansky R-21 turbojet engines and with a crew of two in a tandem arrangement. The mockup was inspected but no further work was ordered due to lack of progress on the &quot;Puma&quot; hardware.

In 1964, Sukhoi started work on &quot;S-58M&quot;. The aircraft was supposed to represent a modification of the Sukhoi Su-15 interceptor (factory designation &quot;S-58&quot;). In the meantime, revised Soviet Air Force requirements called for a low-altitude strike aircraft with STOL capability. A key feature was the ability to cruise at supersonic speeds at low altitude for extended periods of time in order to traverse enemy air defenses. To achieve this, the design included two Tumansky R-27 afterburning turbojets for cruise and four Rybinsk RD-36-35 turbojets for STOL performance. Side-by-side seating for the crew was implemented since the large &quot;Orion&quot; radar antennas required a large frontal cross-section. To test the six-engine scheme, the first Su-15 prototype was converted into &quot;S-58VD&quot; flying laboratory which operated in 1966–1969.

===Design phase===
The aircraft was officially sanctioned on 24 August 1965 under the internal codename &quot;T-6&quot;. The first prototype, &quot;T-6-1&quot;, was completed in May 1967 and flew on 2 July with Vladimir Ilyushin at the controls. The initial flights were performed without the four lift jets, which were installed in October 1967. At the same time, R-27s were replaced with Lyulka AL-21Fs. STOL tests confirmed the data from S-58VD that short-field performance was achieved at the cost of significant loss of flight distance as the lift engines occupied space normally reserved for fuel, loss of under-fuselage hardpoints, and instability during transition from STOL to conventional flight. So the six-engine approach was abandoned.

By 1967, the F-111 had entered service and demonstrated the practical advantages and solutions to the technical problems of a swing-wing design. On 7 August 1968, the OKB was officially tasked with investigating a variable geometry wing for the T-6. The resulting &quot;T-6-2I&quot; first flew on 17 January 1970 with Ilyushin at the controls. The subsequent government trials lasted until 1974, dictated by the complexity of the onboard systems. The day or night and all-weather capability was achieved – for the first time in Soviet tactical attack aircraft – thanks to the &quot;Puma&quot; nav/attack system consisting of two &quot;Orion-A&quot; superimposed radar scanners for nav/attack, a dedicated &quot;Relyef&quot; terrain clearance radar to provide automatic control of flights at low and extremely low altitudes, and an &quot;Orbita-10-58&quot; onboard computer. The crew was equipped with Zvezda K-36D ejection seats, allowing them to bail out at any altitude and flight speed, including during takeoff and landing. The resulting design with a range of and payload of was slightly smaller and shorter ranged than the F-111.

Ten fatal accidents occurred during Su-24 development, killing thirteen Sukhoi and Soviet Air Force test pilots, and more than 5 crashes per year were occurring at average after that 

The first production aircraft flew on 31 December 1971 with V.T. Vylomov at the controls, and on 4 February 1975, T-6 was formally accepted into service as the &quot;Su-24&quot;. About 1,400 Su-24s were produced.

===Upgrades===
Surviving Su-24M models have gone through a life-extension and updating program, with GLONASS, upgraded cockpit with multi-function displays (MFDs), HUD, digital moving-map generator, Shchel helmet-mounted sights, and provision for the latest guided weapons, including R-73 (AA-11 &#x27;Archer&#x27;) air-to-air missiles. The upgraded aircraft are designated &quot;Su-24M2&quot;.

==Design==

The Su-24 has a shoulder-mounted variable geometry wing outboard of a relatively small fixed wing glove, swept at 69°. The wing has four sweep settings: 16° for takeoff and landing, 35° and 45° for cruise at different altitudes, and 69° for minimum aspect ratio and wing area in low-level dashes. The variable geometry wing provides excellent STOL performance, allowing a landing speed of , even lower than the Sukhoi Su-17 despite substantially greater takeoff weight. Its high wing loading provides a stable low-level ride and minimal gust response.

The Su-24 has two Saturn/Lyulka AL-21F-3A afterburning turbojet engines with 109.8 kN (24,700 lbf) thrust each, fed with air from two rectangular side-mounted intakes with splitter plates/boundary-layer diverters.

In early Su-24 (&quot;Fencer A&quot; according to NATO) aircraft these intakes had variable ramps, allowing a maximum speed of , Mach 2.18, at altitude and a ceiling of . Because the Su-24 is used almost exclusively for low-level missions, the actuators for the variable intakes were removed to reduce weight and maintenance. This has no effect on low-level performance, but absolute maximum speed and altitude are cut to Mach 1.35 and . The earliest Su-24 had a box-like rear fuselage, which was soon changed in production to a rear exhaust shroud more closely shaped around the engines to reduce drag. The revised aircraft also gained three side-by-side antenna fairings in the nose, a repositioned braking chute, and a new ram-air inlet at the base of the tail fin. The revised aircraft were dubbed &quot;Fencer-B&quot; by NATO, but did not merit a new Soviet designation.

===Armament===

The Su-24&#x27;s fixed armament is a single fast-firing GSh-6-23 cannon with 500 rounds of ammunition, mounted in the fuselage underside. The gun is covered with an eyelid shutter when not in use. Two or four R-60 (NATO AA-8 &#x27;Aphid&#x27;) infrared missiles are usually carried for self-defence by the Su-24M/24MK.

Initial Su-24s had basic electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, with many Su-24s limited to the old Sirena radar-warning receiver with no integral jamming system. Later-production Su-24s had more comprehensive radar warning, missile-launch warning, and active ECM equipment, with triangular antennas on the sides of the intakes and the tip of the vertical fin. This earned the NATO designation &quot;Fencer-C&quot;, although again it did not have a separate Soviet designation. Some &quot;Fencer-C&quot; and later &quot;Su-24M&quot; (NATO &quot;Fencer-D&quot;) have large wing fence/pylons on the wing glove portion with integral chaff/flare dispensers; others have such launchers scabbed onto either side of the tail fin.

==Operational history==

Substantial numbers of ex-Soviet Su-24s remain in service with Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. In 2008, roughly 415 were in service with Russian forces, with 321 in the Russian Air Force and 94 in the Russian Navy.
The Russian Aerospace Forces will eventually replace the Su-24 with the Sukhoi Su-34.

===Soviet–Afghan War===

The Soviet Union used some Su-24s in the Soviet–Afghan War, with an initial round of strikes in 1984 and a second intervention at the end of the war in 1988. No Su-24 was lost.

On October 13, 1990, Syrian Air Force jets entered Lebanese airspace in order to strike General Michel Aoun&#x27;s military forces. Seven Su-24s were used in this operation.

===Operation Desert Storm===
During Operation Desert Storm, the Iraqi Air Force evacuated 24 of its 30 Su-24MKs to Iran. Another five were destroyed on the ground, while the sole survivor remained in service after the war.

===Tajik and Afghan civil wars===
Fencers were used by the Uzbek Air Force (UzAF) against United Tajik Opposition operating from Afghanistan (which also had a civil war of its own going on), as part of a wider air campaign in support of the embattled government of Tajikistan during the 1992–97 civil war. A Su-24M was shot down on 3 May 1993 with an FIM-92 Stinger MANPADS fired by fundamentalists. Both Russian crew members were rescued.

In August 1999 Tajikistan protested over an alleged strike involving four UzAF Su-24s against Islamist militants in areas close to two mountain villages in the Jirgatol District that, despite not producing human casualties, killed some 100 head of livestock and set ablaze several crop fields. Tashkent denied the accusations.

In the final stages of the 1996-2001 phase of the Afghan civil war, Uzbekistan launched airstrikes against Taliban positions in support of the Northern Alliance. During a mission to attack a Taliban armoured infantry unit near Heiratan, a UzAF Su-24 was shot down on 6 June 2001, killing both crew members.

===First Chechen War===

On 3 February 1995, during operations over Chechnya, a Russian Su-24M hit the ground in bad weather killing both crew members.

===Second Chechen War===
Su-24s were used in combat during the Second Chechen War performing bombing and reconnaissance missions. Up to four were lost, one due to hostile fire: on 4 October 1999, a Su-24 was shot down by a SAM while searching for the crash site of a downed Su-25. The pilot was killed while the navigator was taken prisoner.

=== 2008 Russo-Georgian War ===
In August 2008, a low intensity conflict in the breakaway Georgian regions of Samachablo and Abkhazia, escalated into the 2008 South Ossetia war. Russian Su-24s flew bombing and reconnaissance sorties over Georgia. Russia admitted that three of its Su-25 strike aircraft and one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber were lost. &quot;Moscow Defence Brief&quot; provided a higher estimate, saying that Russian Air Force total losses during the war were one Tu-22M3 long-range bomber, one Su-24M Fencer tactical bomber, one Su-24MR Fencer E reconnaissance plane and four Su-25 attack planes. Anton Lavrov listed one Su-25SM, two Su-25BM, two Su-24M and one Tu-22M3 lost.

===Libyan Air Force===
Libya received five Su-24MK and one Su-24MR from the Soviet Union in 1989. This was one of the last deliveries by the USSR to Libya before the end of the Cold War. One Su-24MK and one Su-24MR may have been transferred to the Syrian Arab Air Force. At the beginning of 2011, the Libyan Air Force was ordered to attack rebel positions and opposition rallies. The Libyan Air Force was limited to a composite force of some MiG-23 (due to be retired, according to plans) and Su-22 and few units of flyable MiG-21, Su-24 and Mirage F1ED fighter-bombers, supported by Soko G-2 Galeb and Aero L-39 Albatros armed trainers. The largest part of the former fleet was in disrepair or stored in not flyable condition. On 5 March 2011, at the beginning of the 2011 Libyan civil war, rebels shot down a Libyan Air Force Su-24MK during fighting around Ra&#x27;s Lanuf with a ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft gun. Both crew members died. A BBC reporter was on the scene soon after the event and filmed an aircraft part at the crash site showing the emblem of the 1124 Squadron, flying the Su-24MK.

===Syrian Civil War===
Starting in November 2012, 18 months after the beginning of the Syrian Civil War and four months after the beginning of air raids by fixed-wing SyAAF aircraft, Su-24 bombers were filmed attacking rebel positions. The SAF suffered its first Su-24 loss, an upgraded MK2 version, to an Igla surface-to-air missile on 28 November 2012 near the town of Darat Izza in the Aleppo Governorate. One of the crew members, Col. Ziad Daud Ali, was injured and filmed being taken to a rebel field hospital.

Syrian Su-24s have reportedly also been involved in near-encounters with NATO warplanes. The first of such incidents occurred in early September 2013, when Syrian Su-24s of the 819th Squadron (launched from Tiyas Military Airbase) flew low over the Mediterranean and approached the 14-mile air exclusion zone surrounding the British airbase in Akrotiri, Cyprus. The jets turned back before reaching the area due to two RAF Eurofighter Typhoons being scrambled to intercept them. Turkey also sent two F-16s. The Fencers were possibly testing the air defenses of the base (and their reaction time) in preparation for a possible military strike by the U.S., the United Kingdom and France in the aftermath of the chemical weapons attack in Ghouta, Damascus allegedly committed by the Syrian government.

On 23 September 2014, a Syrian Su-24 was shot down by an Israeli Air Defense Command MIM-104D Patriot missile near Quneitra, after it had flown into Israeli controlled airspace over the occupied Golan Heights. The missile hit the aircraft when it already re-entered into the Syrian air space. Both crew members ejected safely and landed in Syrian territory.

On 18 March 2018, a SyAAF Su-24 was shot down by rebels in East Qalamoun, East of Damascus province; it fell into territory controlled by Syrian government forces.

On 1 March 2020, two SyAAF Su-24MK2s were shot down by Turkish Air Force F-16s using air-to-air missiles over the Idlib province. All four pilots ejected safely.

====2015 Russian military operation in Syria====

While the Russian Air Force (VVS) aviation group deployed at Khmeimim base in Latakia included modern types such as the Su-30SM, Su-34, and the Su-35, the vast majority of airstrikes (over 80%) were conducted by Su-24Ms. According to &quot;The Aviationist&quot;, at least twelve Su-24M2 bombers were deployed in September 2015. Regardless of type used, the VVS fighter-bombers used old unguided bombs stockpiled during the Soviet era against the insurgents. On 24 November 2015, a Russian Su-24M was shot down by a flight of two Turkish F-16s near the Turkey–Syrian border. The two crew ejected before the plane crashed in Syrian territory. Russia claimed that the jet had not left Syrian airspace while Turkey claimed that the jet entered their airspace and was warned 10–12 times before being shot down.

A deputy commander in a Syrian Turkmen brigade claimed that his personnel shot and killed the crew while they were descending in their parachutes, while some Turkish officials subsequently stated that the crew was still alive. The weapon systems officer was rescued by Russian forces but the pilot was killed by rebels, along with a Russian marine involved in a helicopter rescue attempt. Russian president Vladimir Putin warned Turkey of serious consequences. To increase safety during aerial operations in the region, Russian fighter jets would escort bombers, S-400 SAM systems were deployed in Syria and a Russian cruiser was stationed off the coast to protect Russian aircraft. Following the incident, Russia announced that Su-24s in Syria had been armed with air-to-air missiles on operational sorties.

===Russian encounters with NATO forces===

In late May 2015, a pair of Russian Su-24s made a low pass over the in the Black Sea. In April 2016, several Russian Su-24s flew within 30 metres of another American ship, the destroyer in the Baltic Sea. The incidents occurred over two days, with the planes making passes by the &quot;Donald Cook&quot; while it was in international waters. In November 2018, two armed Russian Su-24s flew low over the Belgian auxiliary ship &quot;Godetia&quot;. At the time of the incident, the &quot;Godetia&quot; was in use as the command ship of NATO’s northern mine-sweeping fleet.

===Saudi-led intervention in Yemen===
In March 2015, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir committed Sudan to join the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis. The Sudanese military effort included the commitment of up to four recently acquired Sudanese Air Force Su-24s to the Saudi King Khalid Air Base where they were photographed. Sudanese Armed Forces did not specify the type of mission the Su-24s conducted. Integrating several Soviet-made combat jets with air forces using modern Western models (F-15s, F-16s, F/A-18s, Tornadoes, Typhoons) during an active military campaign would represent a historical first, requiring extensive communication integration or leaving the Soviet-made jets operating on a different mission plan. Air defense units, like Saudi MIM-104 Patriot batteries, would either need to stand down, taking the risk of not monitoring for incoming threats or some very specific orders to avoid shooting down friendlies.
On 28 March 2015, during Operation Decisive Storm, Houthi forces claimed they shot down a Sudanese Air Force Su-24. Houthis published photos of an allegedly captured Sudanese pilot and metal parts claiming it as the aircraft wreckage.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War ===


The Ukrainian Air Force inherited all of its Su-24s from the Soviet Union when the latter dissolved in 1991. In 2009, amid declining relations with Russia, Ukraine began to have difficulty obtaining spare parts from Sukhoi. On 5 August 2019, the announced a modernization and MRO program for Ukraine&#x27;s Su-24M bombers and Su-24MR reconnaissance aircraft.

During the war in Donbas, a Ukrainian Air Force Su-24 was damaged by a MANPADS fired by pro-Russian forces on 2 July 2014. One of the engines was damaged but the crew managed to return to base and land. During landing a new fire started but it was extinguished by the ground crew. Initially identified as a Su-25, on 20 August 2014 a Ukrainian Su-24M was shot down by Russian proxy forces in the Luhansk Oblast and confirmed by Ukrainian authorities who reported that the crew members ejected safely and were recovered. On 21 August 2014, the downed plane was identified as a Su-24M.

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
Ukraine reportedly had 10 to 20 operational Su-24s prior to the invasion by Russia in 2022. Lack of standoff missiles meant that Ukrainian crews had to fly into range of Russian air defences to strike their targets. The 7th Tactical Aviation Brigade suffered many losses in the first few months of the invasion.

In the first hours of the invasion, the Ukrainian Air Force used at least two Su-24Ms during the Battle of Antonov Airport against Russian Airborne Forces that had flown in the airport in helicopters. On 27 February, one Ukrainian Su-24 was lost near Bucha, Kyiv Oblast. The pilots, Major Ruslan Oleksandrovich Bilous and Captain Roman Oleksandrovich Dovhalyuk, were killed and were posthumously awarded with the Order of Bohdan Khmelnytsky. Another bomber was reported lost on 3 April, when a video emerged showing the crash site with the remains of a blue-coloured AL-21 engine employed by the Su-24. On 22 March, another Ukrainian Su-24M was shot down by Russian forces in Izyum. The navigator ejected successfully, but the pilot, Major Oleksiy Oleksandrovich Kovalenko, was killed. On 19 May, a Su-24 was lost near Pylove. The pilot, Lt. Colonel Igor Khamar and the navigator, Major Ilya Negar, were killed.

On 9 August, explosions at Saky Airport in Novofedorivka, Crimea, destroyed and damaged several aircraft on the ground, among them at least five Russian Naval Aviation Su-24s. Russia denied the loss of any aircraft, though this was rebutted by satellite imagery.

On 9 October 2022, a Russian Su-24 crashed during landing in the Rostov region in Russia due to technical malfunction. As of 30 March 2023, the Oryx open-source intelligence website has visually confirmed ten Russian Su-24 losses.
In May 2023, the United Kingdom supplied Ukraine with Storm Shadow air-launched cruise missiles, allowing Su-24s to launch strikes from a safer distance. On 24 May, Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov tweeted a composite image of a Su-24MR carrying a Storm Shadow missile on its right wing glove pylon. As a Storm Shadow weighs almost 2,900 pounds, only the Su-24 or Su-27 can carry it.
On 2 July, it was reported that Ukrainian Su-24s were modified with pylons taken from decommissioned RAF Panavia Tornado GR4s in order to carry and launch the Storm Shadow missile. The aircraft can carry at least two Storm Shadows at once. It appears that the coordinates have to be entered while the aircraft is on the ground.

On 11 July 2023, Russian Lieutenant general Oleg Tsokov was killed in an airstrike on the command post of the 58th Combined Arms Army in occupied Berdiansk, during the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive; Russian state media alleged he was killed by a Storm Shadow missile launched from a Ukrainian Su-24.

On 9 September 2023, Russian sources claimed that six boats of an attempted Ukrainian amphibious operation near Cape Tarkhankut were intercepted by a Russian Su-24M; three of the boats were sunk using RBK-500 bombs, according to Russian milbloggers.

On 13 September 2023, an attack on Sevastopol Shipyard resulted in damage to port facilities, the submarine &quot;Rostov-na-Donu&quot; and the landing ship &quot;Minsk&quot;, both of which were in dry dock. In a Telegram post, Ukrainian Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk strongly implied the use of either British Storm Shadow or French SCALP missiles launched by Ukrainian Su-24s. 

On 22 September, Ukrainian Su-24s firing Storm Shadow missiles struck the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. The Ukrainian military alleged that the strike was timed to coincide with a meeting of naval officials and there were casualties.

On 4 November 2023, Ukrainian Su-24s launched at least three cruise missiles, either Storm Shadows or SCALPs, striking the newly built Russian corvette &quot;Askold&quot; at the Zalyv Shipbuilding Yard in Kerch. The ship, which was to enter service in the second half of 2023, suffered extensive damage to its port side.

On 5 December 2023, Lieutenant General Mykola Oleschuk stated that a Ukrainian RBS 70 anti-aircraft missile took down Su-24 aircraft using RBS-70 MANPAD in Odesa Oblast.

As of 6 December 2023, Oryx equipment loss tracker reported Russian losses as 1 Su-24M strike aircraft, 1 Su-24MR tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and 10 Su-24M/MR strike/tactical reconnaissance aircraft; and Ukrainian losses as 18 Su-24M strike aircraft, 1 Su-24MR tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and 1 unspecified Su-24 type.

On 26 December 2023, the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk was attacked by the Ukrainian Air Force. The ship was destroyed in an air attack by Ukrainian Su-24s using cruise missiles. Russian officials claimed that two Ukrainian Su-24s were shot down, although this was refuted by the Ukrainian Air Force&#x27;s spokesperson.

S6

: An early project in the gestation of the Su-24, like a meld of the Su-7 and Su-15.

T6-1
:The initial prototype with cropped delta wings and 4 RD-36-35 lift engines in the fuselage.

T6-2I / T6-3I / T6-4I
:Prototypes for the variable geometry Su-24 production aircraft.

Su-24
:The first production version, the armaments include Kh-23 and Kh-28 type air-to-ground guided missiles, together with R-55 type air-to-air guided missiles. Manufactured between 1971–1983, with around 500 units produced. 

Su-24M (&#x27;Fencer-D&#x27;)
:Work on upgrading the Su-24 started in 1971, and included the addition of inflight refueling and expansion of attack capabilities with even more payload options. &quot;T-6M-8&quot; prototype first flew on 29 June 1977, and the first production Su-24M flew on 20 June 1979. The aircraft was accepted into service in 1983. Su-24M has a 0.76 m (30 in) longer fuselage section forward of the cockpit, adding a retractable refueling probe, and a reshaped, shorter radome for the attack radar. It can be identified by the single nose probe in place of the three-part probe of earlier aircraft. A new &quot;PNS-24M&quot; inertial navigation system and digital computer were also added. A &quot;Kaira-24&quot; laser designator/TV-optical quantum system (similar to the American Pave Tack) was fitted in a bulge in the port side of the lower fuselage, as well as Tekon track and search system (in pod), for compatibility with guided weapons, including 500 and 1,500kg laser-guided bombs and TV-guided bombs, and laser/TV-guided missiles Kh-25 and Kh-29L/T, anti-radar missiles Kh-58 and Kh-14 (AS-12 &#x27;Kegler&#x27;) and Kh-59 (AS-13 &#x27;Kingbolt&#x27;)/Kh-59M TV-target seeker guided missiles. The new systems led to a reduction in internal fuel amounting to 85 L (22.4 US gal). Su-24M was manufactured between 1981–1993, with around 770 units produced.

Su-24M2 (&#x27;Fencer-D&#x27;)
:Next modernization of Su-24M introduced in 2000 with the &quot;Sukhoi&quot; program and in 1999 with the &quot;Gefest&quot; program. The modernized planes are equipped with new equipment and systems. As a result, they get new capabilities and improved combat efficiency, including new navigation system (SVP-24), new weapons control system, new HUD (ILS-31, like in Su-27SM or KAI-24) and expanding list of usable munitions (Kh-31A/P, Kh-59MK, KAB-500S). The last batch of the Sukhoi was delivered to the Russian VVS in 2009. Modernization continues with the program &quot;Gefest&quot;. All frontline bombers Su-24 in the Central Military District received new sighting and navigation systems SVP-24 in 2013.

Su-24MK (&#x27;Fencer-D&#x27;)
:Export version of the Su-24M with downgraded avionics and weapons capabilities. First flight 30 May 1987 as &quot;T-6MK&quot;, 17 May 1988 as Su-24MK. Manufactured 1988–1992, sold to Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Syria. Many Iraqi examples were evacuated to Iran.

;Su-24MR (&#x27;Fencer-E&#x27;)
:Dedicated tactical reconnaissance variant. First flight 25 July 1980 as &quot;T-6MR-26&quot;, 13 April 1983 as Su-24MR. Entered service in 1983, with 130 units manufactured. Su-24MR retains much of the Su-24M&#x27;s navigation suite, including the terrain-following radar, but deletes the Orion-A attack radar, the laser/TV system, and the cannon in favor of two panoramic camera installations, &#x27;Aist-M&#x27; (&#x27;Stork&#x27;) TV camera, RDS-BO &#x27;Shtik&#x27; (&#x27;Bayonet&#x27;) side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), and &#x27;Zima&#x27; (&#x27;Winter&#x27;) infrared reconnaissance system. Other sensors are carried in pod form. Manufactured 1983–1993. It is also being modernized.

Su-24MP (&#x27;Fencer-F&#x27;)
:Dedicated electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) variant, intended to replace the Yak-28PP &#x27;Brewer-E&#x27;. First flight 14 March 1980 as &quot;T-6MP-25&quot;, 7 April 1983 as Su-24MP. The Su-24MP has additional antennas for intelligence-gathering sensors and radar jamming, omitting the laser/TV fairing, but retaining the cannon and provision for up to four R-60 (AA-8) missiles for self-defense. Only 10 were built.

==Notable recent accidents and incidents==
* On 14 May 1975, a Russian Air Force Su-24 from the 63rd Bomber Regiment suffered an accidental ejection when the navigator&#x27;s control stick snagged the ejection handle of his Zvezda K-36 ejection seat. Powering on the aircraft&#x27;s hydraulics caused the control stick to move forward, pulling the handle and ejecting the navigator. This incident marks the first successful ejection from an aircraft in zero-zero conditions outside of a testing environment.
* On 10 April 2011 an Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Su-24MK crashed close to Khavaran village near the city of Sarvestan, about 80 km east of Shiraz in the southern province of Fars.
* On 30 October 2012, a Russian Air Force Su-24M crashed in Chelyabinsk Oblast, Russia. During the flight the nose cone fractured. After attempting an emergency landing, the crew of two flew to open territory and safely ejected. A regional government website stated that emergency was the result of aircraft control system failure. Flights of Su-24 were suspended at the Shagol base.
* On 21 March 2014, a Ukrainian Air Force Su-24M belonging to the 7th Brigade crashed during approach for landing near Starokonstantinov in the Khmelnitsky region, Ukraine. Both crew members ejected safely.
* On 23 September 2014, a Syrian Su-24 was shot down by the Israeli Air Defence Command after entering Israeli air space above the Golan Heights. The aircraft was intercepted by a MIM-104 Patriot SAM.
* On 13 October 2014, an Algerian Air Force Su-24 crashed during a training flight killing both crew members
* On 6 July 2015, a Russian Air Force Su-24 crashed outside of Khabarovsk in Russia&#x27;s Far East killing one out of two crew members.
* On 24 November 2015, a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-24 was shot down by a Turkish F-16 near the Turkey-Syria border. Both crew ejected, but the pilot was killed by Turkmen rebels as he parachuted to the ground, while the navigator was rescued.
* On 10 October 2017, a Russian Aerospace Forces Su-24 crashed during takeoff at Khmeimim Air Base, Latakia province, Syria. Both crew members died in the crash.

<text>William Frederick Lemke (August 13, 1878 – May 30, 1950) was an American politician who represented North Dakota in the United States House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party. He was also the Union Party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 1936 presidential election.

==Life and career==
He was born in Albany, Minnesota, and raised in Towner County, North Dakota, the son of Fred Lemke and Julia Anna Kleir, pioneer farmers who had accumulated some of land. Lemke lost an eye in a boyhood accident. As a boy, Lemke worked long hours on the family farm, attending a common school for only three months in the summers. However, the family did reserve enough money to send him to the University of North Dakota, where he was not only a superior student, but also well known for his ability to impersonate the professors. Graduating in 1902, he stayed at the state university for the first year of law school but moved to Georgetown University, then to Yale Law School, where he finished work on his law degree and won the praise of the dean. He returned to his home state in 1905 to set up practice at Fargo. Lemke was a Freemason.

During the 1910s, the Nonpartisan League (NPL) was formed and quickly gained significant traction in North Dakota. Lemke was heavily involved and quickly became one of its top leaders. He is considered by many to be the brains of the operation, often being called the &quot;bishop&quot; or &quot;political bishop&quot; of the NPL.

Lemke was elected attorney general of North Dakota in 1920, although this violated the rule set by NPL leader A. C. Townley about its leaders running for office. By this time the NPL was plagued with infighting and controversies and public support was declining. In 1921, a special recall election, initiated by opponents of the NPL (the Independent Voters Association or IVA) successfully removed all three members of the Industrial Commission, all of which were NPL members: John N. Hagan (Commissioner of Agriculture and Labor), Lynn Frazier (Governor), and Lemke (Attorney General). They were replaced with IVA-supported candidates.

However, Lemke remained popular. In 1922, he received the NPL&#x27;s nomination for governor, but he was defeated by incumbent Ragnvald Nestos. Later, in 1932, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, as a member of the Non-Partisan League (NPL). Also in 1932, William Lemke campaigned for Franklin D Roosevelt for President in
North Dakota and other states in the Midwest.

While in Congress, Lemke earned a reputation as a progressive populist and supporter of the New Deal, championing the causes of family farmers and co-sponsoring legislation to protect farmers against foreclosures during the Great Depression.

In 1934, Lemke co-sponsored the Frazier–Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act, restricting the ability of banks to repossess farms. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the act into law on June 28, 1934. The Act was later struck down by the Supreme Court in &quot;Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford&quot;. Lemke tried to get the Act re-passed by Congress, but was stymied by the Roosevelt administration which privately told Congressmen that they would exercise a Presidential veto against the bill. The Act was eventually re-passed and later held constitutional by the Supreme Court. Lemke was a political friend and ally of Louisiana populist Huey Long prior to his assassination in 1935.

In June 1936, Lemke accepted the nomination of the Union Party, a short-lived third party, as its candidate for President of the United States. He received 892,378 votes, or just under two percent nationwide, and no electoral votes in the 1936 election. Lemke did outpoll Alf Landon in six North Dakota counties and remained the last third-party presidential candidate to outpoll a major-party nominee in any non-Southern county until George Wallace outpolled Hubert Humphrey in Utah&#x27;s arch-Republican Kane County in 1968 and his successor John G. Schmitz outpolled George McGovern in four Idaho counties in 1972. Simultaneously, he was reelected to the House of Representatives as a Republican. Many believe Lemke&#x27;s acceptance of the Union Party nomination in 1936 was out of bitterness toward Roosevelt over the farm mortgage issue. Through the Union Party, Lemke befriended other populists such as Fr. Charles Coughlin.

In 1940, having already received the Republican nomination for a fifth House term, he withdrew from that race to launch an unsuccessful run as an independent for the U.S. Senate. He ran again for the House in 1942 as a Republican and served four more terms, until his death in 1950.

From 1943 to 1948, Lemke was the champion for establishment of the Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park (now Theodore Roosevelt National Park). The National Park Service did not support this proposal, and oddly enough Lemke was no admirer of Theodore Roosevelt, but he seems to have pursued the establishment of a park in anticipation of the economic benefits it might bring to the region. His efforts were ultimately successful, with the park established by act of Congress in June, 1948.

Lemke died of a heart attack in Fargo, North Dakota and is buried in Riverside Cemetery. Former Atlanta Braves baseball player Mark Lemke is Lemke&#x27;s second cousin twice removed.

<doc id="382339" wikidata="Q636716" url="?curid=382339" title="Proof that 22/7 exceeds π">
<text>Proofs of the mathematical result that the rational number is greater than  (pi) date back to antiquity. One of these proofs, more recently developed but requiring only elementary techniques from calculus, has attracted attention in modern mathematics due to its mathematical elegance and its connections to the theory of Diophantine approximations. Stephen Lucas calls this proof &quot;one of the more beautiful results related to approximating &quot;.
Julian Havil ends a discussion of continued fraction approximations of with the result, describing it as &quot;impossible to resist mentioning&quot; in that context.

The purpose of the proof is not primarily to convince its readers that is indeed bigger than . Systematic methods of computing the value of exist. If one knows that is approximately 3.14159, then it trivially follows that  &lt; , which is approximately 3.142857. But it takes much less work to show that  &lt;  by the method used in this proof than to show that is approximately 3.14159.

==Background==
 is a widely used Diophantine approximation of . It is a convergent in the simple continued fraction expansion of . It is greater than , as can be readily seen in the decimal expansions of these values:

:formula_1

The approximation has been known since antiquity. Archimedes wrote the first known proof that is an overestimate in the 3rd century BCE, although he may not have been the first to use that approximation. His proof proceeds by showing that is greater than the ratio of the perimeter of a regular polygon with 96 sides to the diameter of a circle it circumscribes.

== Proof ==
The proof first devised by British electrical engineer Donald Percy Dalzell (1898–1988) in 1944 can be expressed very succinctly:

:formula_2

Therefore,  &gt; .

The evaluation of this integral was the first problem in the 1968 Putnam Competition.
It is easier than most Putnam Competition problems, but the competition often features seemingly obscure problems that turn out to refer to something very familiar. This integral has also been used in the entrance examinations for the Indian Institutes of Technology.

==Details of evaluation of the integral==
That the integral is positive follows from the fact that the integrand is non-negative; the denominator is positive and the numerator is a product of nonnegative numbers. One can also easily check that the integrand is strictly positive for at least one point in the range of integration, say at . Since the integrand is continuous at that point and nonnegative elsewhere, the integral from 0 to 1 must be strictly positive.

It remains to show that the integral in fact evaluates to the desired quantity:

: formula_3

(See polynomial long division.)

==Quick upper and lower bounds==
In , it is pointed out that if 1 is substituted for in the denominator, one gets a lower bound on the integral, and if 0 is substituted for in the denominator, one gets an upper bound:

:formula_4

Thus we have
:formula_5

hence 3.1412 &lt; &lt; 3.1421 in decimal expansion. The bounds deviate by less than 0.015% from . See also .

==Proof that 355/113 exceeds ==
As discussed in , the well-known Diophantine approximation and far better upper estimate  for follows from the relation

:formula_6

:formula_7

where the first six digits after the decimal point agree with those of . Substituting 1 for in the denominator, we get the lower bound

:formula_8

substituting 0 for in the denominator, we get twice this value as an upper bound, hence

:formula_9

In decimal expansion, this means , where the bold digits of the lower and upper bound are those of .

==Extensions==
The above ideas can be generalized to get better approximations of ; see also and (in both references, however, no calculations are given). For explicit calculations, consider, for every integer ,

:formula_10

where the middle integral evaluates to

:formula_11

involving . The last sum also appears in Leibniz&#x27; formula for. The correction term and error bound is given by

:formula_12

where the approximation (the tilde means that the quotient of both sides tends to one for large ) of the central binomial coefficient follows from Stirling&#x27;s formula and shows the fast convergence of the integrals to .

Calculation of these integrals: For all integers and we have

:formula_13

Applying this formula recursively times yields

:formula_14

Furthermore,

:formula_15

where the first equality holds, because the terms for cancel, and the second equality arises from the index shift in the first sum.

Application of these two results gives

:formula_16

For integers , using integration by parts times, we obtain

:formula_17

Setting , we obtain

:formula_18

Integrating equation (1) from 0 to 1 using equation (2) and , we get the claimed equation involving .

The results for are given above. For we get

:formula_19

and

:formula_20

hence , where the bold digits of the lower and upper bound are those of . Similarly for ,

:formula_21

with correction term and error bound

:formula_22

hence . The next step for is

:formula_23

with

:formula_24

which gives .

First celebrated in the United States in 1988, the initial idea was grounded in the feminist and gay liberation spirit of the personal being political, and the emphasis on the most basic form of activism being coming out to family, friends, and colleagues, and living life as an openly LGBTQIA+ person. The founders believed that homophobia thrives in an atmosphere of silence and ignorance and that once people know that they have loved ones who are LGBTQIA+, they are far less likely to maintain homophobic or oppressive views.

==History==
NCOD was inaugurated in 1988 by Robert Eichberg and Jean O&#x27;Leary. Eichberg, who died in 1995 of complications from AIDS, was a psychologist from New Mexico and the founder of the personal growth workshop &quot;The Experience&quot;. O&#x27;Leary was an openly lesbian political leader and long-time activist from New York and was at the time the head of the National Gay Rights Advocates in Los Angeles. LGBT activists, including Eichberg and O&#x27;Leary, did not want to respond defensively to anti-LGBT action because they believed it would be predictable. This led them to establish NCOD to maintain positivity and celebrate coming out. The date of October 11 was chosen because it is the anniversary of the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1987.

Most people think they don&#x27;t know anyone gay or lesbian, and in fact, everybody does. It is imperative that we come out and let people know who we are and disabuse them of their fears and stereotypes.
:– Robert Eichberg, in 1993

Initially administered from the West Hollywood offices of the National Gay Rights Advocates, the first NCOD received participation from eighteen states, garnering national media coverage. In its second year, NCOD headquarters moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and participation grew to 21 states. After a media push in 1990, NCOD was observed in all 50 states and seven other countries. Participation continued to grow, and in 1990, NCOD merged its efforts with the Human Rights Campaign.

In the United States, the Human Rights Campaign manages the event under the National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of LGBT families living honest and open lives. Candace Gingrich became the spokesperson for the day in April 1995.

To celebrate National Coming Out Day on 11 October 2002, Human Rights Campaign released an album bearing the same title as that year&#x27;s theme: &quot;Being Out Rocks&quot;. Participating artists include Kevin Aviance, Janis Ian, k.d. lang, Cyndi Lauper, Sarah McLachlan, and Rufus Wainwright

==Observance==
National Coming Out Day is observed annually to celebrate coming out and to raise awareness of the LGBT community and civil rights movement. The first decades of observances were marked by private and public people coming out, often in the media, to raise awareness and let the mainstream know that everyone knows at least one person who is lesbian or gay. The day has been more of a holiday in recent years because coming out as LGBT is far less risky in most Western countries. Participants often wear pride symbols such as pink triangles and rainbow flags.

National Coming Out Day is also observed in Ireland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Portugal. In the United States, the Human Rights Campaign sponsors NCOD events under the auspices of their National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of LGBT families living honest and open lives. Candace Gingrich became the spokesperson for NCOD in April 1995. From 1999 to 2014, the Human Rights Campaign announced a theme to go with each NCOD:

* 1999: Come Out to Congress
* 2000: Think it O-o-ver (Who Will Pick the New Supremes?)
* 2001: An Out Odyssey 
* 2002: Being Out Rocks!
* 2003: It&#x27;s a Family Affair
* 2004: Come Out. Speak Out. Vote. 
* 2005–2007: Talk About It
* 2009: Conversations from the Heart
* 2010–2011: Coming Out for Equality
* 2012: Come Out. Vote.
* 2013–2014: Coming Out Still Matters

== Perspectives on &quot;coming out&quot; ==
Radical feminist poet and author Adrienne Rich, in her 1980 essay &quot;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence&quot;, suggests that the need to come out stems from the pressure to adhere to heterosexuality from birth, or compulsory heterosexuality. Rich uses the example that heterosexual people never have to come out as heterosexual, and that societal support of heterosexuality as the norm leads to homosexuality being viewed as an anomaly. She explores how the oppressive, ubiquitous nature of compulsory heterosexuality has historically resulted in many lesbians never realizing their true nature or not discovering their orientation until later in life.

NCOD has traditionally been a celebratory day for the LGBT community. However, Preston Mitchum, a black queer writer, in his article, &quot;On National Coming Out Day, Don&#x27;t Disparage the Closet&quot;, published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2013, questions the assumptions that he believes NCOD makes. While Mitchum does not discredit those who have come out and praises them for their bravery, he also points out that coming out may not always be safe for LGBT people in multiple marginalized communities. Mitchum also suggests that coming out can lead to hypervisibility for those with intersecting identities, potentially leading to discrimination in the workplace, family exile, violence, and criminalization.

<text>According to the Bible, Tola () was one of the Judges of Israel. His career is summarised in Judges 10:1-2. He judged Israel for 23 years after Abimelech died. He lived at Shamir in Mount Ephraim, where he was also buried.

His name means &quot;Crimson worm&quot; or &quot;scarlet stuff.&quot; The son of Puah and the grandson of Dodo from the tribe of Issachar, he had the same name as one of the sons of Issachar who migrated to Egypt with Jacob his grandfather in .

Of all the biblical judges, the least is written about Tola. None of his deeds are recorded. The entire account from Judges 10:1-2 (KJV) follows:
:&quot;1And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim&quot;.
:&quot;2And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir&quot;.

<doc id="382344" wikidata="Q905354" url="?curid=382344" title="Agkistrodon piscivorus">
<text>Agkistrodon piscivorus is a species of venomous snake, a pit viper in the subfamily Crotalinae of the family Viperidae. It is one of the world&#x27;s few semiaquatic vipers (along with the Florida cottonmouth), and is native to the Southeastern United States. As an adult, it is large and capable of delivering a painful and potentially fatal bite. When threatened, it may respond by coiling its body and displaying its fangs. Individuals may bite when feeling threatened or being handled in any way. It tends to be found in or near water, particularly in slow-moving and shallow lakes, streams, and marshes. It is a capable swimmer, and like several species of snakes, is known to occasionally enter bays and estuaries and swim between barrier islands and the mainland.

The generic name is derived from the Greek words &#x27; &quot;fish-hook, hook&quot; and &quot;tooth&quot;, and the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] comes from the [[Latin]] &#x27;fish&#x27; and &#x27;(I) eat greedily, devour&#x27;; thus, the [[scientific name]] translates to &quot;hook-toothed [[piscivore|fish-eater]]&quot;. [[Common names]] includecottonmouth,northern cottonmouth,water moccasin,swamp moccasin,black moccasin, and simplyviper&quot;&#x27;. Many of the common names refer to the threat display, in which this species often stands its ground and gapes at an intruder, exposing the white lining of its mouth. Many scientists dislike the use of the term water moccasin since it can lead to confusion between the venomous cottonmouth and nonvenomous water snakes.

===Subspecies and taxonomic history===
For many decades, one species with three subspecies were formally recognized: eastern cottonmouth, &quot;A. p. piscivorus&quot; (Lacépède, 1789); western cottonmouth, &quot;A. p. leucostoma&quot; (Troost, 1836); and Florida cottonmouth, &quot;A. p. conanti&quot; Gloyd, 1969. However, a molecular (DNA) based study was published in 2014, applying phylogenetic theories (one implication being no subspecies are recognized), changing the long-standing taxonomy. The resulting and current taxonomic arrangement recognizes two species and no subspecies. The western cottonmouth (&quot;A. p. leucostoma&quot;) was synonymized with the eastern cottonmouth (&quot;A. p. piscivorus&quot;) into one species (with the oldest published name, &quot;A. p. piscivorus&quot;, having priority). The Florida cottonmouth (&quot;A. p. conanti&quot;) is now recognized as a separate species.

==Anatomy and description==
&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot; is the largest species of the genus &quot;Agkistrodon&quot;. Adults commonly exceed in total length (including tail); females are typically smaller than males. Total length, per one study of adults, was . Average body mass has been found to be in males and in females. Occasionally, individuals may exceed in total length, especially in the eastern part of the range.

Although larger ones have purportedly been seen in the wild, according to Gloyd and Conant (1990), the largest recorded specimen of &quot;A. p. piscivorus&quot; was in total length, based on a specimen caught in the Dismal Swamp region and given to the Philadelphia Zoological Garden. This snake had apparently been injured during capture, died several days later, and was measured when straight and relaxed. Large specimens can be extremely bulky, with the mass of a specimen of about in total length known to weigh .

Many would assume that the morphology of an aquatic snake should have a small, narrow head that tapers towards the back to minimize drag in the water, especially when capturing prey. However, the pit vipers, and particularly Cottonmouths, display a contradicting structure, with its bulky, triangular head, which would be assumed to be poorly suited to water, yet it is not the case.

The broad head is distinct from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with the rim of the top of the head extending forwards slightly further than the mouth. Substantial cranial plates are present, although the parietal plates are often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal scale is absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, it has 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have keels, although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50. Many of the latter may be divided.
Though most specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of the head and facial markings), the color pattern may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish ground color, which is overlaid with a series of 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands on either side of the body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the ground color, often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal banding pattern fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with dark spots, and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is a more or less uniform brown color, especially in &quot;A. p. piscivorus&quot;. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of &quot;A. contortrix&quot;, but sometimes these are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered with pale pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.

Juvenile and subadult specimens generally have a more contrasting color pattern, with dark crossbands on a lighter ground color. The ground color is then tan, brown, or reddish-brown. The tip of the tail is usually yellowish, becoming greenish-yellow or greenish in subadults, and then black in adults. On some juveniles, the banding pattern can also be seen on the tail. Young snakes wiggle the tips of their tails to lure prey animals.

This species is often confused with the copperhead, &quot;A. contortrix&quot;. This is especially true for juveniles, but differences exist. &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; has broad, dark stripes on the sides of its head that extend back from the eyes, whereas &quot;A. contortrix&quot; has only a thin, dark line that divides the pale supralabials from the somewhat darker color of the head. The watersnakes of the genus &quot;Nerodia&quot; are also similar in appearance, being thick-bodied with large heads, but they have round pupils, no loreal pit, a single anal plate, subcaudal scales that are divided throughout, and a distinctive overall color pattern.

===Venom===
&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot; venom is more toxic than that of &quot;A. contortrix&quot;, and is rich with powerful cytotoxic venom that destroys tissue. Although deaths are rare, the bite can leave scars, and on occasion, require amputation. Absent an anaphylactic reaction in a bitten individual, however, the venom does not cause systemic reactions in victims and does not contain neurotoxic components present in numerous rattlesnake species. Bites can be effectively treated with CroFab antivenom; this serum is derived using venom components from four species of American pit vipers (the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes, the Mojave rattlesnake, and the cottonmouth).

Bites from the cottonmouth are relatively frequent in the lower Mississippi River Valley and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, although fatalities are rare. Allen and Swindell (1948) compiled a record of &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; bites in Florida from newspaper accounts and data from the Bureau of Vital Statistics: 1934, eight bites and three fatalities (no further fatalities were recorded after this year); 1935, 10; 1936, 16; 1937, 7; 1938, 6; 1939, 5; 1940, 3; 1941, 6; 1942, 3; 1943, 1; 1944, 3; 1998, 1. Wright and Wright (1957) report having encountered these snakes on countless occasions, often almost stepping on them, but never being bitten. In addition, they heard of no reports of any bites among 400 cypress cutters in the Okefenokee Swamp during the entire summer of 1921. These accounts suggest that the species is not particularly aggressive. Studies show that stressed snakes are more likely to strike. This action comes as a predator defense mechanism. Snakes with elevated hormone levels are more likely to strike. Additionally, larger snakes are more likely to strike than smaller snakes.

Brown (1973) gave an average venom yield (dried) of 125 mg, with a range of 80–237 mg, along with values of 4.0, 2.2, 2.7, 3.5, 2.0 mg/kg IV, 4.8, 5.1, 4.0, 5.5, 3.8, 6.8 mg/kg IP and 25.8 mg/kg SC for toxicity. Wolff and Githens (1939) described a specimen that yielded 3.5 ml of venom during the first extraction and 4.0 ml five weeks later (1.094 grams of dried venom). The human lethal dose is unknown, but has been estimated at 100–150 mg.

Symptoms commonly include ecchymosis and swelling. The pain is generally more severe than bites from the copperhead, but less so than those from rattlesnakes (&quot;Crotalus&quot; spp.). The formation of vesicles and bullae is less common than with rattlesnake bites, although necrosis can occur. Myokymia is sometimes reported. However, the venom has strong proteolytic activity that can lead to severe tissue destruction.

==Geographic range==

&quot;A. piscivorus&quot; is found in the eastern US from the Great Dismal Swamp in southeast Virginia, south through the Florida peninsula and west to Arkansas, eastern and southern Oklahoma, and western and southern Georgia (excluding Lake Lanier and Lake Allatoona). A few records exist of the species being found along the Rio Grande in Texas, but these are thought to represent disjunct populations, now possibly eradicated. The type locality given is &quot;Carolina&quot;, although Schmidt (1953) proposed this be restricted to the area around Charleston, South Carolina. Snakes observed in the northern areas of this range are typically larger older individuals.

Campbell and Lamar (2004) mentioned this species as being found in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Maps provided by Campbell and Lamar (2004) and Wright and Wright (1957) also indicate its presence in Western and Middle Tennessee and extreme southeastern Kansas, and limit it to the western part of Kentucky.

In Georgia, it is found in the southern half of the state up to a few kilometers north of the Fall Line with few exceptions. Its range also includes the Ohio River Valley as far north as southern Indiana, and it inhabits many barrier islands off the coasts of the states where it is found.

&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot; is the most aquatic species of the genus &quot;Agkistrodon&quot;, and is usually associated with bodies of water, such as creeks, streams, marshes, swamps, and the shores of ponds and lakes. This species has a unique swimming pattern and appears to be floating on top of the water rather than swimming with its body beneath the surface. The U.S. Navy (1991) describes it as inhabiting swamps, shallow lakes, and sluggish streams, but it is usually not found in swift, deep, cool water. Behler and King (1979) list its habitats as including lowland swamps, lakes, rivers, bayheads, sloughs, irrigation ditches, canals, rice fields, and small, clear, rocky, mountain streams.

It is also found in brackish-water habitats and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf Coast barrier islands than the copperhead. Even on these islands, though, it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.

The snake is not limited to aquatic habitats, however, as Gloyd and Conant (1990) mentioned large specimens have been found more than a mile (1.6 km) from water. In various locations, the species is well-adapted to less moist environments, such as palmetto thickets, pine-palmetto forest, pine woods in East Texas, pine flatwoods in Florida, eastern deciduous dune forest, dune and beach areas, riparian forest, and prairies.

==Behavior and ecology==

In tests designed to measure the various behavioral responses by wild specimens to encounters with people, 23 of 45 (51%) tried to escape, while 28 of 36 (78%) resorted to threat displays and other defensive tactics. Only when they were picked up with a mechanical hand were they likely to bite.

When sufficiently stressed or threatened, this species engages in a characteristic threat display that includes vibrating its tail and throwing its head back with its mouth open to display the startlingly white interior, often making a loud hiss while the neck and front part of the body are pulled into an S-shaped position. Many of its common names, including &quot;cottonmouth&quot; and &quot;gaper&quot;, refer to this behavior, while its habit of snapping its jaws shut when anything touches its mouth has earned it the name &quot;trap jaw&quot; in some areas. Other defensive responses can include flattening the body and emitting a strong, pungent secretion from the anal glands located at the base of the tail. This musk may be ejected in thin jets if the snake is sufficiently agitated or restrained. The smell has been likened to that of a billy goat, as well as to a genus of common flood-plain weeds, &quot;Pluchea&quot;, that also have a penetrating odor.

Harmless watersnakes of the genus &quot;Nerodia&quot; are often mistaken for it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be aggressive when provoked, but they behave differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee quickly into the water, while &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not vibrate their tails when excited. &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; usually holds its head at an angle around 45° when swimming or crawling.

Brown (1973) considered their heavy muscular bodies to be a striking characteristic, stating this made it difficult to hold them for venom extraction owing to their strength.

This species may be active during the day and at night, but on bright, sunny days, they are usually found coiled or stretched out in the shade. In the morning and on cool days, they can often be seen basking in the sunlight. They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. Contrary to popular belief, they are capable of biting while under water.

In the north, they hibernate during the winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted they were one of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply into the soft wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might have something to do with hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.

===Hunting and diet===

Raymond Ditmars (1912) described &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; as carnivorous. Its diet includes mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, eggs, insects, other snakes, small turtles, and small alligators. Cannibalism has also been reported. Normally, though, the bulk of its diet consists of fish and frogs. On occasion, juvenile specimens feed on invertebrates. Catfish (especially of the genus &quot;Ictalurus&quot;) are often eaten, although the sharp spines sometimes cause injuries. Toads of the genus &quot;Bufo&quot; are apparently avoided. Common prey species include southern leopard frogs, bass, juvenile black rat snakes, young common snapping turtles, and North American least shrews.

Many authors have described the prey items taken under natural circumstances. Although fish and frogs are their most common prey, they eat almost any small vertebrate. Fish are captured by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when bodies of water begin to dry up in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They are surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.

They are opportunistic hunters and sometimes eat carrion, making them one of the few snakes to do so. Campbell and Lamar (2004) described having seen them feeding on fish heads and viscera that had been thrown into the water from a dock. Heinrich and Studenroth (1996) reported an occasion in which an individual was seen feeding on the butchered remains of a feral hog (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) that had been thrown into Cypress Creek. Northern cottonmouths have an unusual feeding adaptation that allows them to adhere to prey through rotation of their head during swallowing because it aids the jaws in clearing the prey and contributes to the advance of the jaws along the prey.

Conant (1929) gave a detailed account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (&quot;A. contortrix&quot;), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized. A 2018 study found that northern cottonmouths on a diet of only fish when compared to a diet of mice had to eat 20% more to achieve the same growth.

There have been several studies focusing on the types of prey that cottonmouths consume, and analyzing the differences between juveniles, adult males, and adult females. It has been found that adult males and females target different prey types and sizes. Observations and stomach analyses show that adult males consume fish, whereas adult females mainly consume other squamates, in particularly snakes. In this same research, it was concluded that the prey size increased with the size of the snake for both juvenile and adults, both male and female.

Young individuals have yellowish or greenish tail tips and engage in caudal luring. The tail tip is wriggled to lure prey, such as frogs and lizards, within striking distance. Wharton (1960) observed captive specimens exhibiting this behavior between 07:20 and 19:40 hours, which suggests it is a daytime activity.

In August 2020 and May 2021, individuals found in Florida were observed to have consumed introduced Burmese pythons (&quot;Python bivittatus&quot;). Burmese pythons are an invasive species in Florida with the capacity to inflict great damage to the local ecosystem, so it is hoped that &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; may be in the process of modifying its diet to enable it to hunt the pythons.

===Natural predators===
&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot; is preyed upon by snapping turtles (&quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;), falcons, American alligators (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;), horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), eagles, red-shouldered hawks (&quot;Buteo lineatus&quot;), loggerhead shrikes (&quot;Lanius ludovicianus&quot;), and large wading birds, such as herons, cranes, and egrets.

It is also preyed upon by ophiophagous snakes, including their own species. Humphreys (1881) described how a specimen was killed and eaten by a captive kingsnake. On the other hand, Neill (1947) reported captive kingsnakes (&quot;Lampropeltis getula&quot;) were loath to attack them, being successfully repelled with &quot;body blows&quot;. Also called body-bridging, this is a specific defensive behavior against ophiophagous snakes, first observed in certain rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus&quot;) species by Klauber (1927), that involves raising a section of the middle of the body above the ground to varying heights. This raised loop may then be held in this position for varying amounts of time, shifted in position, or moved towards the attacker. In the latter case, it is often flipped or thrown vigorously in the direction of the assailant. In &quot;A. piscivorus&quot;, the loop is raised laterally, with the belly facing towards the attacker.

==Reproduction==

&quot;Agkistrodon piscivorus&quot; is ovoviviparous, with females usually giving birth to one to 16 live young and possibly as many as 20. Litters of six to eight are the most common. Neonates are in length (excluding runts), with the largest belonging to &quot;A. p. conanti&quot; and &quot;A. p. leucostoma&quot; the smallest. If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available, growth is rapid and females may reproduce at less than three years of age and a total length of as little as . They will also only reproduce every other year, unless optimal conditions are met for them to go through the reproduction process. The young are born in August or September, while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year, at least in certain parts of its range.

Regarding &quot;A. p. piscivorus&quot;, an early account by Stejneger (1895) described a pair in the Berlin Zoological Garden that mated on January 21, 1873, after which eight neonates were discovered in the cage on July 16 of that year. The young were each in length and thick. They shed for the first time within two weeks, after which they accepted small frogs, but not fish.

Combat behavior between males has been reported on a number of occasions, and is very similar in form to that seen in many other viperid species. An important factor in sexual selection, it allows for the establishment and recognition of dominance as males compete for access to sexually active females.

A few accounts exist that describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case was described by Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found at the entrance of a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike. One study stated that females will remain with their young for one to two weeks until the young finishes their first shed cycle.

===Facultative parthenogenesis===
Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; can reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis, that is, they are capable of switching from a sexual mode of reproduction to an asexual mode. This likely involves recombination at the tips of the chromosomes, which leads to genome wide homozygosity. The result is the expression of deleterious recessive alleles and often to developmental failure (inbreeding depression). Both captive-born and wild-born &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; specimens appear to be capable of this form of parthenogenesis.

==Conservation status==
The species &quot;A. piscivorus&quot; is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. When last assessed in 2007, the population trend was stable.

Constant persecution of the species and drainage of wetland habitat prior to development has taken a heavy toll on local populations. Despite this, it remains a common species in many areas.

In Indiana, the cottonmouth is listed as an endangered species.

<text>In the Biblical Book of Judges, Jair or Yair ( &quot;Yā’īr&quot;, &quot;he enlightens&quot;) was a man from Gilead. He was of the Tribe of Manasseh and also descended from the Tribe of Judah (Numbers 32:39-41, 1 Chronicles 2:21-23). Jair judged Israel for 22 years, after the death of Tola, who had ruled of 23 years. His inheritance was in Gilead through the line of Machir, the son of Manasseh.

According to Judges 10:3–5, Jair had thirty sons, who rode thirty ass colts, and controlled 30 cities in Gilead which came to be known as Havoth-Jair (Judges 10:4; cf. 23 towns in 1 Chronicles 2:22). The word &quot;chawwoth&quot; (&#x27;tent encampments&#x27;) occurs only in this context (&quot;Numbers&quot; 32:41; &quot;Deuteronomy&quot; 3:14; &quot;Judges&quot; 10:4). 

Jair died and was buried in Kamon, which could be a place that Antiochus III conquered, according to Polybius, but also could be a symbolic term related to the Greek word for &#x27;furnace&#x27;.

After his death there were 18 years of infidelity to the God of the Israelites and oppression at the hands of their Philistine and Ammonite neighbours.

King David appointed a Jairite named Ira as his chief ruler or priest after Sheba&#x27;s rebellion.

== Genealogy ==
Jair’s father was Segub. Segub’s father was Hezron. Hezron’s father was Perez. Perez’s father was Judah. Segub’s mother was Machir’s daughter. Machir was the son of Manasseh.

== In Jewish legend ==
According to Pseudo-Philo (38-39) and the Chronicle of Jerahmeel (48 and 68), The successor to Abimelech equalled, if he did not surpass, him in wickedness. Jair erected an altar unto Baal, and on penalty of death he forced the people to prostrate themselves before it. Only seven men remained firm in the true faith, and refused to the last to commit idolatry. Their names were Deuel, Abit Yisreel, Jekuthiel, Shalom, Ashur, Jehonadab, and Shemiel. They said to Jair: &quot;We are mindful of the lessons given us by our teachers and our mother Deborah. &#x27;Take ye heed,&#x27; they said, &#x27;that your heart lead you not astray to the right or to the left. Day and night ye shall devote yourselves to the study of the Torah.&#x27; Why, then, dost thou seek to corrupt the people of the Lord, saying, &#x27;Baal is God, let us worship him&#x27;? If he really is what thou sayest, then let him speak like a god, and we will pay him worship.&quot; For the blasphemy they had uttered against Baal, Jair commanded that the seven men be burnt. When his servants were about to carry out his order, God sent the angel Nathaniel, the lord over the fire, and he extinguished the fire though not before the servants of Jair were consumed by it. Not only did the seven men escape the danger of suffering death by fire, but the angel enabled them to flee unnoticed, by striking all the people present with blindness. Then the angel approached Jair, and said to him: &quot;Hear the words of the Lord ere thou diest. I appointed thee as prince over my people, and thou didst break My covenant, seduce My people, and seek to burn My servants with fire, but they were animated and freed by the living, the heavenly fire. As for thee, thou wilt die, and die by fire, a fire in which thou wilt abide forever.&quot; Thereupon the angel burnt him with a thousand men, whom he had taken in the act of paying homage to Baal.

<text>Hermosillo International Airport (); officially &quot;Aeropuerto Internacional General Ignacio L. Pesqueira&quot; (General Ignacio L. Pesqueira International Airport) , is an international airport situated in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. It handles both national and international air traffic for the Hermosillo metropolitan area. It also houses military facilities for the Mexican Army and supports logistics and cargo airlines. Additionally, it facilitates various activities related to tourism, flight training, and general aviation. It functions as a focus city for the regional airline TAR Aerolíneas. 

The airport&#x27;s operations are managed by Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico, and it is named after Ignacio L. Pesqueira, a former Governor of Sonora. In 2024, it ranked as the busiest airport in Sonora and the twelfth-largest in Mexico, serving 2,156,900 passengers. Traffic surpassed the 2-million threshold for the first time in 2023.

== History ==

The current airport was inaugurated in 1982 to replace the former airfield previously located in an area known as &quot;La Manga&quot;. Hermosillo has a historical significance as a commercial aviation hub, particularly for Aeromexico. Starting in the 1940s, it served as a connecting point for cities in northwestern Mexico and Arizona, including Tijuana, La Paz, Chihuahua, Torreón, Nogales, Ciudad Obregón, Guaymas, Cananea, Tucson, and Phoenix. 

During the 1990s and 2000s, Aerolitoral, now known as Aeroméxico Connect, operated a hub out of Hermosillo for many years. This hub connected cities across Mexico and also offered flights to U.S. cities such as Los Angeles and Phoenix. However, it was eventually downsized to a focus city and ultimately closed in 2017.

From 1988 to 1999, the airport served as the headquarters and hub for the regional airline Aviación del Noroeste. In the early 2000s, the airport&#x27;s runway and taxiways were widened to accommodate wide-body aircraft that might need to divert, such as Aeromexico&#x27;s Boeing 787 on several occasions.

== Facilities ==

The airport is situated at an elevation of above mean sea level. It features a single runway, designated as 05/23, measuring in length and surfaced with asphalt. The commercial apron can accommodate 12 narrow-body aircraft, and there is a general aviation apron for fixed-wing aircraft as well as two heliports for private and occasional third-level commercial aviation use. The airport frequently serves as the primary alternate airport for flights going to Tijuana International Airport in cases of unfavorable weather or technical issues.

The passenger terminal accommodates both arrivals and departures for domestic and international flights. The ground floor houses the arrivals area with customs and immigration facilities, the baggage claim area, and the departures section that includes a check-in area, a security checkpoint, and a departures concourse with gates 1-6 that provide direct access to the apron, enabling passengers to walk to their aircraft. From this departure concourse, access to the upper floor is available, which houses snack bars, souvenir shops, and gates 7 and 8 equipped with jet bridges for boarding. The airport provides taxi services, and ground transportation is offered by four companies with a fleet of 120 vehicles, including cars and Eurovan-type vans.Hermosillo Airport also hosts cargo facilities and includes a dedicated general aviation terminal situated to the north of the passenger terminal. It supports various activities, such as tourism, flight training, executive aviation, and general aviation. The airport has obtained several certifications, including the Clean Industry certification from PROFEP, ISO-9000, and accessibility for users with special needs. Within its facilities, there is a water treatment plant that processes sewage water for reuse in garden irrigation and various construction processes, including dust control and earthwork.

Air Force Base No. 18 () (BAM-18) is a facility of the Mexican Air Force located at the Hermosillo Airport. It is the operational base for the 107th Air Squadron, which operates Cessna 182 and Pilatus PC-6 aircraft. Additionally, the 3rd Air Surveillance Squadron operates C-26 Metroliner and Embraer 145 AEW&amp;C aircraft at these facilities, and the 204th Air Squadron operates Beechcraft T-6 Texan II aircraft. The base encompasses a aviation platform, three hangars, and various accommodations for Air Force personnel.

<text>The Montlake Cut is the easternmost section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, which passes through the city of Seattle, linking Lake Washington to Puget Sound. It opened in 1916 after 56 years of conversation and construction to create the manmade canal.

The path along the cut was designated a National Recreation Trail as Montlake Cut National Waterside in 1971.

The cut provides a connection between Union Bay, part of Lake Washington, to the east and Portage Bay, an arm of Lake Union, to the west. It is spanned by the Montlake Bridge, a bascule drawbridge carrying Montlake Boulevard (State Route 513). Most of the land on the north shore of the cut is occupied by the University of Washington, its medical school to the west and its stadium parking lot to the east; residences and a recreational trail occupy the south bank, which is part of the Montlake neighborhood.

Before the creation of the Montlake Cut, the land was regularly used by the Duwamish tribe and the holds important history within the tribe, that is commonly overlooked.

== History ==
Before the construction of the Montlake Cut, it was known by the Duwamish as &quot;Carry a Canoe&quot; (Lushootseed: sxWátSadweehL). Indigenous people had been portaging between the lakes for centuries, either carrying canoes or shoving them along an intermittent creek that appeared when Lake Washington overflowed. This creek was known as the black river and was a large source of food and transportation for the Duwamish tribe. The black river often flooded and destroyed the crops nearby; however, it was clear that its use for transportation was very advantageous. This utility sparked inspiration to create a larger-scale version of the black river that would link Lake Washington and Lake Union with Puget Sound, an idea that would benefit King County economically, allowing it to become a large shipping harbor.

Local landowners began digging a canal on their land, following the trail that the Duwamish tribe had created between the two lakes. However in 1903, after 30 years of discussion, it was decided by the Army Corps of Engineers that this plan would not be feasible because there would be a need for two locks to maintain the height of Lake Washington and Lake Union.

Ten years later, Major C. W. Kutz of the Army Corps of Engineers wished to move forward with the plan but with only one lock in Ballard. This resulted in great upset and lawsuits over the lowering of Lake Washington that would result from the excavation of the cut. On October 26, 1910, Kutz sent his assistant to set off dynamite at the head of the cut, forcing Lake Washington to be lowered. 

The Montlake Cut&#x27;s original name was Erickson Cut. Contractor C. J. Erickson commenced the big project in turning on his big steam shovel in celebration of the October 27, 1909, post A-Y-P Exposition era, in the final push to complete the Lake Washington Canal project. At the ceremony were Judge Roger S. Greene, Judge Thomas Burke, J. S. Brace and John H. McGraw, who turned the first shovel of dirt that day.

== Environmental impact ==
The creation of the cut lowered the water level of Lake Washington by , drained the wetlands around the lake, and lowered the lake below the outflow at the Black River, leaving the Black River dry.
The effects on the water level of Lake Washington also resulted in a great reduction of the salmon population in the lake. The Black River gave the Duwamish people salmon, which was an important part of their diet and a major part of their spirituality.

Although the ecosystem of the Montlake Cut has since recovered, the damages were major at the time.

== Present day ==
The industrial uses of the Montlake Cut have since decreased, and it is now primarily used for leisure boating and recreational uses. The cut is a popular location of recreational swimming and sunbathing for University of Washington students during the spring and summer.

The cut is home to the University of Washington rowing team, serving as the final 500 meters of the 2,000-meter racecourse.

It is the site of the annual Windermere Cup crew regatta and the Seattle Yacht Club&#x27;s Opening Day Boat Parade, both of which take place on the first Saturday in May.

<doc id="382350" wikidata="Q639493" url="?curid=382350" title="History of the Peloponnesian War">
<text>The History of the Peloponnesian War /ˌpɛləpəˈniːʃən/ is a historical account of the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), which was fought between the Peloponnesian League (led by Sparta) and the Delian League (led by Athens). It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian historian who also served as an Athenian general during the war. His account of the conflict is widely considered to be a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The &quot;History&quot; is divided into eight books.

Analyses of the &quot;History&quot; generally occur in one of two camps. On the one hand, some scholars such as J. B. Bury view the work as an objective and scientific piece of history. The judgment of Bury reflects this traditional interpretation of the &quot;History&quot; as &quot;severe in its detachment, written from a purely intellectual point of view, unencumbered with platitudes and moral judgments, cold and critical.&quot;

On the other hand, in keeping with more recent interpretations that are associated with reader-response criticism, the &quot;History&quot; can be read as a piece of literature rather than an objective record of the historical events. This view is embodied in the words of W. R. Connor, who describes Thucydides as &quot;an artist who responds to, selects and skillfully arranges his material, and develops its symbolic and emotional potential.&quot;

== Historical method ==

Thucydides is considered to be one of the key figures in the development of Western history, thus making his methodology the subject of much analysis in the area of historiography.

=== Chronology ===
Thucydides is one of the first western historians to employ a strict standard of chronology, recording events by year, with each year consisting of the summer campaign season and a less active winter season. This method contrasts sharply with Herodotus.

=== Speeches ===
Thucydides also makes extensive use of speeches in order to elaborate on the event in question. While the inclusion of long first-person speeches is somewhat alien to modern historical method, in the context of ancient Greek oral culture, speeches are expected. These include addresses given to troops by their generals before battles and numerous political speeches, both by Athenian and Spartan leaders, as well as debates between various parties. Of the speeches, the most famous is the funeral oration of Pericles, which is found in Book Two. Being an Athenian general in the war, Thucydides heard some of these speeches himself. For the other speeches, he relied on eyewitness accounts.

These speeches are suspect in the eyes of classicists, however, inasmuch as it is not clear to what degree Thucydides altered these speeches in order to elucidate better the crux of the argument presented. Some of the speeches are probably fabricated according to his expectations of, as he puts it, &quot;what was called for in each situation&quot; (1.22.1).

=== Neutrality ===
Despite being an Athenian and a participant in the conflict, Thucydides is often regarded as having written a generally unbiased account of the conflict with respect to the sides involved in it. In the introduction to the piece he states, &quot;my work is not a piece of writing designed to meet the taste of an immediate public, but was done to last for ever&quot; (1.22.4).

There are scholars, however, who doubt this. Ernst Badian, for example, has argued that Thucydides has a strong pro-Athenian bias. In keeping with this sort of doubt, other scholars claim that Thucydides had an ulterior motive in his Histories, specifically to create an epic comparable to those of the past such as the works of Homer, and that this led him to create a nonobjective dualism favoring the Athenians. The work does display a clear bias against certain people involved in the conflict, such as Cleon.

=== Role of religion ===
The gods play no active role in Thucydides&#x27; work. This is very different from Herodotus, who frequently mentions the role of the gods, as well as a nearly ubiquitous divine presence in the centuries-earlier poems of Homer. Instead, Thucydides regards history as being caused by the choices and actions of human beings.

Despite the absence of actions of the gods, religion and piety play critical roles in the actions of the Spartans, and to a lesser degree, the Athenians. Thus natural occurrences such as earthquakes and eclipses were viewed as religiously significant (1.23.3; 7.50.4)

=== Rationalization of myth ===
Despite the absence of the gods from Thucydides&#x27; work, he still draws heavily from the Greek mythos, especially from Homer, whose works are prominent in Greek mythology. Thucydides references Homer frequently as a source of information, but always adds a distancing clause, such as &quot;Homer shows this, if that is sufficient evidence,&quot; and &quot;assuming we should trust Homer&#x27;s poetry in this case too.&quot;

However, despite Thucydides&#x27; skepticism in secondhand information such as Homer&#x27;s, he does use the poet&#x27;s epics to infer facts about the Trojan War. For instance, while Thucydides considered the number of over 1,000 Greek ships sent to Troy to be a poetic exaggeration, he uses Homer&#x27;s Catalogue of Ships to determine the approximate number of Greek soldiers who were present. Later, Thucydides claims that since Homer never makes reference to a united Greek state, the pre-Hellenic nations must have been so disjointed that they could not organize properly to launch an effective campaign. In fact, Thucydides claims that Troy could have been conquered in half the time had the Greek leaders allocated resources properly and not sent a large portion of the army on raids for supplies.

Thucydides makes sure to inform his reader that he, unlike Homer, is not a poet prone to exaggeration, but instead a historian, whose stories may not give &quot;momentary pleasure,&quot; but &quot;whose intended meaning will be challenged by the truth of the facts.&quot; By distancing himself from the storytelling practices of Homer, Thucydides makes it clear that while he does consider mythology and epics to be evidence, these works cannot be given much credibility, and that it takes an impartial and empirically minded historian, such as himself, to accurately portray the events of the past.

== Subject matter of the &quot;History&quot; ==
The first book of the History, after a brief review of early Greek history and some programmatic historiographical commentary, seeks to explain why the Peloponnesian War broke out when it did and what its causes were. Except for a few short excursuses (notably 6.54–58 on the Tyrant Slayers), the remainder of the History (books 2 through 8) rigidly maintains its focus on the Peloponnesian War to the exclusion of other topics.

While the &quot;History&quot; concentrates on the military aspects of the Peloponnesian War, it uses these events as a medium to suggest several other themes closely related to the war. It specifically discusses in several passages the socially and culturally degenerative effects of war on humanity itself. The &quot;History&quot; is especially concerned with the lawlessness and atrocities committed by Greek citizens to each other in the name of one side or another in the war. Some events depicted in the &quot;History&quot;, such as the Melian dialogue, describe early instances of realpolitik or power politics. Noteworthy, there is a possibility that translation mistakes influenced the deductions of realists with regards to the work of Thucydides.

The &quot;History&quot; is preoccupied with the interplay of justice and power in political and military decision-making. Thucydides&#x27; presentation is decidedly ambivalent on this theme. While the &quot;History&quot; seems to suggest that considerations of justice are artificial and necessarily capitulate to power, it sometimes also shows a significant degree of empathy with those who suffer from the exigencies of the war.

For the most part, the &quot;History&quot; does not discuss topics such as the art and architecture of Greece.

=== Military technology ===

The &quot;History&quot; emphasizes the development of military technologies. In several passages (1.14.3, 2.75–76, 7.36.2–3), Thucydides describes in detail various innovations in the conduct of siegeworks or naval warfare. The &quot;History&quot; places great importance upon naval supremacy, arguing that a modern empire is impossible without a strong navy. He states that this is the result of the development of piracy and coastal settlements in earlier Greece.

Important in this regard was the development, at the beginning of the classical period (c. 500 BC), of the trireme, the supreme naval ship for the next several hundred years. In his emphasis on sea power, Thucydides is echoed by the modern naval theorist Alfred Thayer Mahan, whose influential work &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot; helped set in motion the naval arms race prior to World War I.

=== Empire ===
The &quot;History&quot; explains that the primary cause of the Peloponnesian War was the &quot;growth in power of Athens, and the alarm which this inspired in Sparta&quot; (1.23.6). Thucydides traces the development of Athenian power through the growth of the Athenian empire in the years 479 BC to 432 BC in book one of the &quot;History&quot; (1.89–118). The legitimacy of the empire is explored in several passages, notably in the speech at 1.73–78, where an anonymous Athenian legation defends the empire on the grounds that it was freely given to the Athenians and not taken by force. The subsequent expansion of the empire is defended by these Athenians, &quot;...the nature of the case first compelled us to advance our empire to its present height; fear being our principal motive, though honor and interest came afterward.&quot; (1.75.3)

The Athenians also argue that, &quot;We have done nothing extraordinary, nothing contrary to human nature in accepting an empire when it was offered to us and then in refusing to give it up.&quot; (1.76) They claim that anyone in their position would act in the same fashion. The Spartans represent a more traditional, circumspect, and less expansive power. Indeed, the Athenians are nearly destroyed by their greatest act of imperial overreach, the Sicilian expedition, described in books six and seven of the &quot;History&quot;.

=== Earth science ===
Thucydides correlates, in his description of the 426 BC Malian Gulf tsunami, for the first time in the recorded history of natural science, quakes and waves in terms of cause and effect.

== Some difficulties of interpretation ==
Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History&quot; is extraordinarily dense and complex. His particular ancient Greek prose is also very challenging, grammatically, syntactically, and semantically. This has resulted in much scholarly disagreement on a cluster of issues of interpretation.

=== Strata of composition ===
It is commonly thought that Thucydides died while still working on the &quot;History&quot;, since it ends in mid-sentence and only goes up to 411 BC, leaving six years of war uncovered. Furthermore, there is a great deal of uncertainty whether he intended to revise the sections he had already written. Since there appear to be some contradictions between certain passages in the &quot;History&quot;, it has been proposed that the conflicting passages were written at different times and that Thucydides&#x27; opinion on the conflicting matter had changed. Those who argue that the &quot;History&quot; can be divided into various levels of composition are usually called &quot;analysts&quot; and those who argue that the passages must be made to reconcile with one another are called &quot;unitarians&quot;. This conflict is called the &quot;strata of composition&quot; debate. The lack of progress in this debate over the course of the twentieth century has caused many Thucydidean scholars to declare the debate insoluble and to side-step the issue in their work.

=== Sources ===
The &quot;History&quot; is notoriously reticent about its sources. Thucydides almost never names his informants and alludes to competing versions of events only a handful of times. This is in marked contrast to Herodotus, who frequently mentions multiple versions of his stories and allows the reader to decide which is true. Instead, Thucydides strives to create the impression of a seamless and irrefutable narrative. Nevertheless, scholars have sought to detect the sources behind the various sections of the &quot;History&quot;. For example, the narrative after Thucydides&#x27; exile (4.108&quot;ff.&quot;) seems to focus on Peloponnesian events more than the first four books, leading to the conclusion that he had greater access to Peloponnesian sources at that time.

Frequently, Thucydides appears to assert knowledge of the thoughts of individuals at key moments in the narrative. Scholars have asserted that these moments are evidence that he interviewed these individuals after the fact. However, the evidence of the Sicilian Expedition argues against this, since Thucydides discusses the thoughts of the generals who died there and whom he would have had no chance to interview. Instead it seems likely that, as with the speeches, Thucydides is looser than previously thought in inferring the thoughts, feelings, and motives of principal characters in his &quot;History&quot; from their actions, as well as his own sense of what would be appropriate or likely in such a situation.

=== Critical evaluations ===
The historian J. B. Bury writes that the work of Thucydides &quot;marks the longest and most decisive step that has ever been taken by a single man towards making history what it is today.”

Historian H. D. Kitto feels that Thucydides wrote about the Peloponnesian War not because it was the most significant war in antiquity but because it caused the most suffering. Indeed, several passages of Thucydides&#x27; book are written &quot;with an intensity of feeling hardly exceeded by Sappho herself.&quot;

In his &quot;Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;, Karl R. Popper writes that Thucydides was the &quot;greatest historian, perhaps, who ever lived.&quot; Thucydides&#x27; work, however, Popper goes on to say, represents &quot;an interpretation, a point of view; and in this we need not agree with him.&quot; In the war between Athenian democracy and the &quot;arrested oligarchic tribalism of Sparta,&quot; we must never forget Thucydides&#x27; &quot;involuntary bias,&quot; and that &quot;his heart was not with Athens, his native city:&quot;&quot;Although he apparently did not belong to the extreme wing of the Athenian oligarchic clubs who conspired throughout the war with the enemy, he was certainly a member of the oligarchic party, and a friend neither of the Athenian people, the demos, who had exiled him, nor of its imperialist policy.&quot;

== Influence ==
Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History&quot; has been enormously influential in both ancient and modern historiography. It was embraced by many of the author&#x27;s contemporaries and immediate successors with enthusiasm; indeed, many authors sought to complete the unfinished history. For example, Xenophon wrote his &quot;Hellenica&quot; as a continuation of Thucydides&#x27; work, beginning at the exact moment that Thucydides&#x27; &quot;History&quot; leaves off. In later antiquity, Thucydides&#x27; reputation suffered somewhat, with critics such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus rejecting the &quot;History&quot; as turgid and excessively austere. Lucian also parodies it (among others) in his satire &quot;The True Histories&quot;. Woodrow Wilson read the &quot;History&quot; on his voyage across the Atlantic to the Versailles Peace Conference.

In the 17th century, English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (who himself translated the work) wrote about Thucydides as follows:

It hath been noted by divers, that Homer in poesy, Aristotle in philosophy, Demosthenes in eloquence, and others of the ancients in other knowledge, do still maintain their primacy: none of them exceeded, some not approached, by any in these later ages. And in the number of these is justly ranked also our Thucydides; a workman no less perfect in his work, than any of the former; and in whom (I believe with many others) the faculty of writing history is at the highest.

== Manuscripts ==

The most important manuscripts include: Codex Parisinus suppl. Gr. 255, Codex Vaticanus 126, Codex Laurentianus LXIX.2, Codex Palatinus 252, Codex Monacensis 430, Codex Monacensis 228, and Codex Britannicus II, 727.

Grenfell and Hunt discovered about 20 papyrus fragments copied some time between the 1st and 6th centuries AD in Oxyrhynchus, including Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 16 and 17.

<doc id="382351" wikidata="Q1579864" url="?curid=382351" title="Korowai people">
<text>The Korowai, also called the Kolufo, live in southeastern Papua in the Indonesian provinces of South Papua and Highland Papua. Their tribal area is split by the borders of Boven Digoel Regency, Mappi Regency, Asmat Regency, and Yahukimo Regency. They number about 4000 to 4400 people.

According to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Until the late 1970s, when anthropologists embarked on a study of the tribe, the Korowai were unaware of the existence of any peoples other than themselves&quot;.

==Language==
The Korowai language belongs to the Awyu–Dumut family (southeastern Papua) and is part of the Trans–New Guinea phylum. A dictionary and grammar book have been produced by a Dutch missionary linguist.

==Living==
The majority of the Korowai clans live in tree houses on their isolated forested territory. 

Since 1980, some have moved into the recently opened villages of Yaniruma at the Becking River banks (Kombai–Korowai area), Mu, and Mbasman (Korowai–Citak area). In 1987, a village was opened in Manggél, in Yafufla (1988), Mabül at the banks of the Eilanden River (1989), and Khaiflambolüp (1998). 

The village absenteeism rate is still high, because of the relatively long distance between the settlements and the food (sago) resources. 

The Korowai appear to now smoke tobacco but not to drink alcohol.

==Economy==
The Korowai are hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists who practice shifting cultivation. They have excellent hunting and fishing skills. 

Information about Korowai trade patterns is scant. The Korowai have a few gender-specific activities, such as the preparation of sago and the performance of religious ceremonies in which only the male adults are involved.

Some Korowai have since the early 1990s generated moderate cash income by working with tour companies selling tours into the Korowai region. Within the tourist industry, opportunities are limited to hosting tour groups in villages for tourist-sponsored sago feasts, carrying luggage, and performing traditional displays.

==Kinship==
The patriclan is the central unit with respect to social, economic, and political organization. Kinship terminology follows the Omaha I pattern (Lounsbury), knowing a central opposition between cross and parallel relationships. 

In Korowai society, the forms of institutional levirate and predominance of avuncular relationships are found, as well as a kind of affinal avoidance relationships. Marriage is exogamous and polygynous. Preference is given to a conjugal relationship with the (classificatory) mother&#x27;s mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughter.

==Social life==
Leadership structures are based on personal qualities of big men, rather than on institution. Interclan warfare occurs mainly because of witchcraft and sorcery-related conflicts.

==Religious life==
The Korowai universe is filled with a variety of spirits, some more personal of character than others. Reverence is paid especially to the red headed creator god Gimigi. The Korowai ascribe an important role in their daily lives of honoring their &quot;One God&quot; with one being used as the concept of a prime deity from whom all others either descend or to whom all others pay homage. 

Once in a lifetime, a Korowai clan must organize a sago grub festival in order to stimulate prosperity and fertility in a ritual fashion. In times of trouble they sacrifice domesticated pigs to the spirits of the ancestors. 

The Korowai have an extraordinary and rich oral tradition: myths, folktales, (magical) sayings and charms, and totem traditions. With respect to death and afterlife the Korowai believe in the existence of a reciprocal type of reincarnation: those who died can be sent back at any time to the land of the living, by their kinsmen in the land of the dead, in order to reincarnate in a newly born infant of their own clan.

==Contact with Westerners==
The first documented contact by Western scientists with members of a band of western Korowai (or eastern Citak) took place on 17–18 March 1974. The expedition was co-led by anthropologist Peter Van Arsdale (now at the University of Denver), geographer Robert Mitton, and community developer Mark (Dennis) Grundhoefer. Thirty men were encountered on the south bank of the Upper Eilanden River, approximately 12 miles east of its junction with the Kolff River and 10 miles north of the Becking River. A basic word list was generated and observations were recorded regarding such things as fire making techniques.

In the late 1970s, a few Christian (Dutch Protestant) missionaries began to live among the Korowai. Dea Sudarman, an Indonesian anthropologist, made several documentary films on the Korowai for Japanese television in the 1980s. In 1993, a film crew documented an anthropological study in the Dayo village area by the Smithsonian Institution of Korowai treehouse construction and the practice of cannibalism as a form of criminal justice. This resulted in the film &quot;Lords of the Garden&quot;. In 1996 a local Christian community was established, the members of it mainly originating from the neighbouring Kombai people. For a long time the Korowai have been considered exceptionally resistant to religious conversion; however, by the end of the 1990s the first converts to Christianity were baptized. In the autumn of 2003, a small team of Bible translators from Wycliffe/SIL moved to Yaniruma.

In May 2006, tour-guide Paul Raffaele led an Australian &quot;60 Minutes&quot; crew to report on the people. 

The 2007 BBC documentary &quot;First Contact&quot;, presented by Mark Anstice, features footage from his 1999 encounter with members of the Korowai people, and describes how they were disturbed upon seeing a &quot;white ghost&quot;, whose presence indicated the end of the world was nigh.

In January–February 2011, the BBC documentary &quot;Human Planet&quot; commissioned the Korowai building of a treehouse 35m high.

In August 2019, the &quot;Best Ever Food Review Show&quot; channel on YouTube made contact with the Korowai people in which they ate various foods of the culture.

In the documentary My Year with the Tribe, a film team visits the Korowai area several times over a period of one year. The documentary reveals that an industry has developed around the supposedly traditional lives of many Korowai. Many locals take advantage of the Korowai&#x27;s reputation for living a particularly original life in order to earn money. It is also reported that houses located at a particular high altitude have been financed by Western film crews.

==Cannibalism claims==
The Korowai have been reported to practice ritual cannibalism up to the present day. Anthropologists suspect that cannibalism is no longer practiced by the Korowai clans that have had frequent contact with outsiders. Recent reports suggest that certain clans have been coaxed into encouraging tourism by perpetuating the myth that cannibalism is still an active practice.

<text>Duxford is a village in Cambridgeshire, England, about south of Cambridge. It is part of the Hundred Parishes area.

==History==
The village formed on the banks of the River Cam, a little below its emergence from the hills of north Essex. One of the more populous settlements in its hundred, it was split into two ecclesiastical parishes in medieval times until they were united in 1834.

Originally known as &quot;Duxworth&quot; and listed as &quot;Dukeswrthe&quot; in the 10th century, and &quot;Dochesuuorde&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, the village&#x27;s name comes from &quot;Worth (enclosure) of a man called Duc&quot;.

==Churches==
The village has two Grade I listed medieval parish churches, St John&#x27;s Church and St Peter&#x27;s Church. The two parishes were combined in 1874, services being held thereafter at St Peter&#x27;s; St John&#x27;s remained a chapel of ease and finally declared redundant. Still consecrated, it is now in the care of The Churches Conservation Trust. The churchyard has been cleared of headstones and is maintained by Duxford Parish Council. To the north of the village close to the Royston to Newmarket road lies Duxford Chapel, a 14th-century chantry chapel that was probably part of the Hospital of St John. St Peter&#x27;s is part of a small group of churches along with St Mary Magdalene, Ickleton and St Mary &amp; St John, Hinxton. They are known jointly as &#x27;Hinkledux&#x27; and services are divided between the three parishes. St Peter&#x27;s has a bell-ringing group and hosts a pre-school meet up for new parents known as Tiddlers. The current rector is Rev. Lydia Smith.

A Congregational chapel was built in the late 18th century and licensed in 1794, and at its peak in 1850 had a weekly congregation of 350. The chapel joined with other Congregational churches in uniting with the Presbyterian Church of England in 1972, and was known as Duxford United Reformed Church. It is listed Grade II. The final service was held here was in June 2019 and it was sold for conversion to residences in 2021. It is now two separate residences, one of which is an Air BnB for short-term lets.

==Airfield==

Duxford gives its name to RAF Duxford (now called Duxford Aerodrome), a former Royal Air Force airfield that was used as a sector station during the Battle of Britain. Duxford Aerodrome was the home of Douglas Bader&#x27;s Big Wing during that battle. Duxford airfield later became a fighter airfield for the United States Army Air Forces operating P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft. In 1972 the Ministry of Defence began to house historically important aircraft in the hangars, which in 1977 became the Imperial War Museum Duxford.

The airfield was used in the motion picture &quot;The Battle of Britain&quot;. During that production one of the hangars was blown up to simulate a Luftwaffe bombing raid. There are currently three all-weekend air shows a year which have good visibility from the village and it is common to see planes flying over the village, either leisure flights or in essential practice.

==Village life==

The village currently has two remaining pubs – The John Barleycorn and The Plough. Other former pubs and ale houses include The Wheatsheaf (which re-opened in 2018 as Graystones deli/cafe), the Three Horseshoes, first recorded in 1786, the King&#x27;s Head which opened in the mid-19th century, the Flower Pot, located at the end of the old airfield runway on what is now Hunts Road, The Brewer&#x27;s Arms on The Green, The Elms, long since disappeared in the 18th century and The Red Lion, now in the parish of Whittlesford. 

Until 2022 the village held a popular annual Advent Market at St John&#x27;s Church which granted funds for local community projects. There is an annual Soap Box Derby every September which, since 2013, has raised £86,350 for Cancer Research UK. There is a Duxford Women&#x27;s Institute, and a well-supported bowls club. The National Garden Scheme sees several private gardens open to the public for one day a year including Robynet House and Duxford Mill. The local football team is Duxford United FC who play their home games on the recreation ground on Hunts Road. The Duxford Lawn Tennis Club has two courts on the same ground. The school is a Church of England Primary School in the Diocese of Ely which has a breakfast and after-school club (DX) and a playgroup on site. 

In May 2019 the foundations of a new village community centre were dug and the finished building was opened to the public in May 2020. It is now a thriving hub hosting many village and private events, social groups and meetings. There is a vibrant café, Café 19, which attracts a faithful clientele for their superb cakes, coffees and lunches. They also offer roast lunch on Sundays and a pie &amp; pudding evening as well as themed events throughout the year. 

A new public green space was opened in 2020 known as Brewery Field; its landscaping is ongoing, including planting, sowing of chalk upland flowers and plants and public utility installations. As at 2024 there have been two successful Festivals of Nature which have attracted large crowds keen to find out about biodiversity, the environment and ways the community can help wildlife and nature locally. 

On 31st July 2020 a fire gutted the pre-school of Duxford School. It was rebuilt by Kier Construction and completed &amp; reopened in 2023. 

in 2022 a new history society for village began and is resident, once a month, at the Duxford Community Centre. Their New Year&#x27;s Day history walk on 1 January 2023 attracted such a large crowd that it made local headline news. Membership is by annual subscription but visitors are always welcome. 

The monthly parish magazine for the village, delivered free of charge to every household, is called The Duxford Chatterbox.

<doc id="382354" wikidata="Q5501582" url="?curid=382354" title="Fremont Cut">
<text>The Fremont Cut is a canal in Seattle, Washington, United States, that connects Lake Union to the east with Salmon Bay to the west. It is part of the Lake Washington Ship Canal linking Lake Washington to Puget Sound, and is long and wide. The center channel is wide and deep.

==History==
Work first began on the cut when the Lake Washington Improvement Company contracted in 1883 to dig out Ross Creek which at that time was Lake Union’s fresh water outlet to Salmon Bay. The total amount of material excavated was about 2 million cubic yards. Up until the Chittenden Locks were completed in 1917, the Fremont Cut’s eastern end near the Fremont Bridge was separated from Lake Union by a low wooden dam, a small wooden lock, and a spillway.

==Environs==
Named for the neighborhood lying just to the north, the cut is spanned by the Fremont Bridge, a bascule drawbridge that connects Fremont with Queen Anne to the south via Fremont Avenue North. South of the cut is the 456’ high Queen Anne Hill while to the east is the Aurora Bridge (officially the George Washington Memorial Bridge), a cantilever truss, suspension structure that carries old US 99 (Pacific Highway) over the west end of Lake Union. Various high tech companies are located just north of the cut in the Fremont area, notably Adobe Systems, Tableau Software and Google.

<text>The Concordia Stingers are the athletic teams that represent Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. They compete with other schools in Canadian Interuniversity Sport, and more specifically in Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec (RSEQ; French for &quot;Quebec Student Sports Network&quot;). The Stingers were established in 1974 when Sir George Williams University and Loyola College merged to form Concordia University and replaced the preceding Sir George Williams Georgians and Loyola Warriors.

The university has 10 varsity teams - football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby, wrestling, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball.

==Varsity teams==

*Football (M)
*Basketball (M/W)

==Football==

The Concordia Stingers football team is currently coached by Brad Collinson and plays home games at the Concordia Stadium. The Stingers appeared in one Vanier Cup national championship in 1998, but lost to the Saskatchewan Huskies. The Stingers won the Dunsmore Cup three times, but have lost each of the last five times they have appeared in the Quebec title game.

==Basketball==
The men&#x27;s basketball team is coached by Rastko Popovic, and the women&#x27;s basketball team by Tenicha Gittens. John Dore was a former coach.

The men&#x27;s basketball program is a perennial championship-contending squad, having last won the Quebec title in 2019.

On August 1, 2024, the Concordia Stingers men&#x27;s basketball team defeated the Air Force Falcons men&#x27;s basketball 71–55 in a preseason exhibition match. This was the Stingers&#x27; first win over an NCAA Division I squad since a 2019 win over the Quinnipiac University Bobcats, by a score of 98–90.

==Women&#x27;s ice hockey==
==Rugby==
In November 2005, Concordia&#x27;s rugby team came from behind to beat McGill 20–18 at the Percival Molson Stadium to take the men&#x27;s rugby provincial championship—the school&#x27;s first since 2001.

The women&#x27;s rugby team is currently coached by Jocelyn Barrieau with Hughanna Gaw, Craig McDevitt, Craig Beemer, and Lia Hoyte as assistant coaches. In 2010, the Stingers won the Quebec conference and took home a silver medal from the CIS national championship. The women also advanced to nationals in 2009 and placed fourth. Also in 2009, Hughanna Gaw was named 2009 CIS Rookie of the Year. Several stingers played on the senior national fifteens and sevens team including Josée Lacasse, Micheline Green, Erin Dance, Natascha Wesch, Sheila Turner, Margaret Thompson, Sommer Christie, Bianca Farella, Alex Tessier, and Frédérique Rajotte.

He was named to the Concordia University Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. Future Olympian Andy Borodow also competed for the school.

==Club Teams (Varsity 2)==
*Baseball
*Cross-country running
*Golf
*Women&#x27;s Flag Football

===Baseball===
The baseball club, which operates in the fall season under head coach Howie Schwartz, is composed of mostly elite and AA level players from summer leagues and competes at the club level against other schools in Quebec, Ontario and an array of schools from Atlantic Canada for a national championship in late October. The Cape Breton University Capers won in 2005 and Concordia did not make the playoffs. In 2007, the baseball team won their first conference championship in school history over the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees advancing to their first CIBA National Championships. They lost 2–0 in the championship final against the University of New Brunswick.

In 2008, they lost the Conference Title to the Collège Laflèche Dragons in a three-game series.

In 2009, the Concordia Stingers defeated the University of Ottawa Gee-Gees in two straight games to win the CIBA Northern Conference and advance to the CIBA National Championships for the second time in three years. Despite dropping two of their round robin games, on the final day of the tournament, the team won three straight games to capture its first national championship. They defeated the OUA Champion Western University Mustangs 6–2 in the tie-breaker for Fourth Place. The Gee-Gees who were in the Nationals as a Wild Card and beat the Stingers for some revenge in the tournament&#x27;s opening game, were the next victim, as The Stingers won 4–3 with a sixth and seventh inning comeback. In the Championship game, despite going down 1-0 early in the game the Stingers stormed back to win 12–2.

In 2010, the Stingers went 11-5 and finished second to the McGill University Redmen who were 13–3. The Stingers were 3–1 against the Redmen during the regular season. After dropping the Ottawa Gee-Gees in the Semis, the Maroon and Gold defeated McGill in three games in the Finals to capture their second straight Conference championship. At the Nationals in Windsor, Ontario, the Stingers bowed out in the semi-finals, losing to the Brock University Badgers.

In 2011, the Stingers went 13-3 and finished in first place. In the Semi Finals, the Stingers ousted the Redmen in three games after dropping the first game of the series to their fourth place rival. With the series win, The Stingers clinched a trip to their third consecutive CIBA National Championships, to be held in Moncton, New Brunswick. The Stingers failed in their bid to win a third straight conference title, losing in three games to the Carleton University Ravens.

===Cross-country running===
A cross-country running team was revived in 2004. The head coach is currently John Lofranco.

==Promotions and Dance Team==
The Spirit Team was established in 2005, serving as the university&#x27;s first ever dance/cheer team, performing at football games.

==Awards and honors==
===Athletes of the Year===
The Concordia Stingers Female Athlete of the Year is presented with the Sally Kemp Award. The Male Athlete of the Year is bestowed the honour of the Dr. J. Robert Brodrick Award.

<doc id="382362" wikidata="Q7863809" url="?curid=382362" title="UBC Thunderbirds">
<text>The UBC Thunderbirds are the athletic teams that represent the University of British Columbia. In Canadian intercollegiate competition, the Thunderbirds are the most successful athletic program both regionally in the Canada West Universities Athletic Association, and nationally in U Sports, winning 119 national titles. UBC has won an additional 21 national titles competing in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics against collegiate competition from the United States and 43 national titles in sports that compete in independent competitions.

==Teams==
Across 15 varsity sport disciplines, UBC fields 26 teams overall; notably, 15 of which compete in U Sports, six in the American collegiate NAIA, and five of which are independent of these governing organizations:

* Softball (w)
* Track &amp; Field (m/w)

Independent

* Rugby (m)
* Rugby Sevens (w)
* Field Hockey (m)

==Football==
The UBC Thunderbirds football team has won the CWUAA Hardy Trophy conference championship 16 times, which is third all-time among competing teams. On a national level, the team has won the Vanier Cup championship four times, in 1982, 1986, 1997 and, most recently, in 2015. The team has also lost three times in the title game, in 1978, 1987, and 2023. The Thunderbirds program has also yielded three Hec Crighton Trophy winners: Jordan Gagner in 1987; Mark Nohra in 1997; and, most recently, Billy Greene in 2011.

==Baseball==
In the summer of 1996, 30 years after the original UBC baseball program was disbanded due to budget cuts, Athletic Director Bob Phillip along with former professional Jim Murphy and community baseball coach Mark Hiscott provided funding for the present day Thunderbirds baseball. Hiscott recognized student Terry McKaig, a former collegiate player and national team member, as the one to take over the program as head coach. Since 1997, McKaig has been the driving force behind the T-Birds with support and funding from such major leaguers as Jeff Zimmerman and Ryan Dempster. In 2015, Chris Pritchett was named the new head coach of the baseball team and Terry moved up to the position of Director of Baseball.

The Thunderbirds compete in the United States as the only Canadian member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). In 2001, the program reached a new level as the New York Mets made Derran Watts the first ever Thunderbird to be drafted, when they selected him in the 12th round. Since then nine more Thunderbirds have been drafted including 2007 World Series starter Jeff Francis. T-bird baseball successes include their trip to the 2006 NAIA World Series

==Women&#x27;s basketball==
==Men&#x27;s ice hockey==
Father David Bauer coached the Thunderbirds for two seasons, and led the team to a Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship in 1963, and reached the final game of the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union men&#x27;s ice hockey championship tournament for the CIAU University Cup, but lost by a 3–2 score to the McMaster Marauders.

Bob Hindmarch began coaching the men&#x27;s ice hockey team during the 1964–65 season, and led them to the 1971 Western Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship. He accumulated a winning record in 11 of 12 seasons, and set UBC record with 214 wins by a coach in ice hockey. In December 1973, they became one of the first Western Bloc sports teams to tour China, and played a series of games focused on friendship and teaching hockey skills to local players. The trip was supported by the Government of Canada as part of a desire to normalize relations with China, and was not well-publicized at the time. The Thunderbirds won all seven games played by a combined scored of 56 to 5.

==Women&#x27;s ice hockey==
==Men&#x27;s rugby==
Men&#x27;s rugby is one of the oldest varsity sports at UBC (including the precursor to UBC, McGill University College of BC, varsity rugby started in 1906). The varsity XV now competes against the University of Victoria in a two-game, combined score series to claim the coveted &quot;Boot&quot;. They also play a two-game, combined score series against the University of California for the &quot;World Cup&quot; trophy (a competition started in 1921). The varsity XV was coached for many years by Spence McTavish (former UBC varsity rugby captain, former Canadian rugby international and captain, and former Bobby Gaul award winner), and assistant coach Rod Holloway (former UBC varsity rugby scrumhalf, and former assistant coach of Canada&#x27;s National Senior Men&#x27;s team (RWC 1995).

The men&#x27;s team is currently coached by Didier Banse.

UBC&#x27;s rugby program has a long tradition of producing national team rugby players (7s and 15s), most recently Jim Douglas (RWC 2003), Mike Burak (RWC 2007), Chris Pack, Ryan MacWhinney, Justin Mensah-Coker, Tyler Hotson, Eric Wilson, Harry Jones (RWC 2015), Brock Staller and Ben LeSage.

U Sports does not currently contest a national championship for Men&#x27;s Rugby, however UBC are five-time champions of the independent Canadian University Men&#x27;s Rugby Championship in 2017, 2018, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

==Women&#x27;s rugby==
Women&#x27;s rugby is 5 time CanWest XVs Champions and 2024 7s &amp; 15s National Champions. 

==Men&#x27;s soccer==
The UBC Thunderbirds are the most successful men&#x27;s soccer program in Canada, having won 13 U Sports championships, eight more than any other school in the country. They have also won 22 Canada West conference titles since competition started in 1972.

Notable players include Brian Budd, Pat Onstad, and Srdjan Djekanovic.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Thunderbirds played in the old Pacific Coast League, notably finishing as league runners up in 1967–68 and 1968–69.

==Men&#x27;s volleyball==
The Thunderbirds men&#x27;s volleyball team has won four U Sports men&#x27;s volleyball championships and five conference championships. Kerry MacDonald took over the helm of the men&#x27;s volleyball program starting with the 2016–17 season. In the following season, the Thunderbirds defeated the two-time defending champion Trinity Western Spartans in straight sets in the U Sports gold medal match on March 18, 2018 to win their first national title since 1983. MacDonald resigned after this season to take a position with Volley Canada and Mike Hawkins took over as head coach for the 2018–19 season.

==Women&#x27;s volleyball==
The Thunderbirds women&#x27;s volleyball team has been the most successful program in its sport, with 14 National Championship victories, most recently in 2024. The Thunderbirds have also won 16 conference titles with the most recent win occurring in 2014. The team has been led by head coach Doug Reimer since 2000 (and from 1994 to 1997) and he has accounted for ten of the program&#x27;s championship wins. Notably, in the 2013 gold medal match, the Thunderbirds defeated the Alberta Pandas in straight sets to tie U Sports&#x27; all-time record—shared with the Winnipeg Wesmen (1983–1988) and Alberta Pandas (1995–2000) for holding the longest reign as a repeat champion in the sport with six consecutive wins (2008–2013). The program has also featured five Mary Lyons Award winners, with Liz Cordonier (2010), Shanice Marcelle (2011, 2013), Kyla Richey (2012), Lisa Barclay (2014), and Kiera Van Ryk (2019) each winning the award.

==Fight song==
UBC used to have a fight song &quot;Hail UBC&quot;, written by Harold King in 1931. 
A pep song with the same name &quot;Hail UBC&quot;, written by Steve Chatman, was adopted in 2011. The lyrics go:

&quot;Hail to the Thunderbirds! Hail UBC!&quot; 
&quot;Thunder and lightning — Onward to victory!&quot; 
&quot;Hail to the Blue-and-Gold! Hail UBC!&quot; 
&quot;U, B, C forever — Onward to victory!&quot;

==NCAA membership bid==
In 2005, they applied to become members of the principal U.S. college sports governing body, the NCAA. They are not the first Canadian school to try to join the NCAA; in 2000, local rival Simon Fraser, then exclusively an NAIA member, sought to join the NCAA but was turned down. At the time, the NCAA&#x27;s constitution prohibited non-U.S. schools from joining; however, some observers believed the real reason Simon Fraser was turned down was that the school sought to join as a Division II school, and the NCAA did not want to set a precedent with a lower-level school. UBC, on the other hand, was reportedly interested in joining Division I. UBC&#x27;s athletic budget of approximately $4 million Canadian is dwarfed by those of schools in the Pac-12 Conference, the only BCS conference on the U.S. West Coast. However, at least two mid-major conferences with a West Coast presence, the West Coast Conference and Western Athletic Conference, had been suggested as possible future homes for the Thunderbirds.

The NCAA approved a change to its constitution on January 14, 2008 to allow Canadian schools to become members. Under a 10-year pilot program due to begin June 1, 2008, Canadian schools can join the NCAA as Division II members, and any school that meets the June 1 deadline for application can become a member as of the academic year immediately following the deadline. CIS has not officially indicated whether a school joining the NCAA under this program can retain its CIS membership. It was expected that both UBC and Simon Fraser would be among the first schools to apply for NCAA membership under this program. Simon Fraser did apply and was accepted, but in April 2009 UBC deferred a decision on applying.

==Awards and honours==
Since 1984, the Outstanding Female Athlete of the Year Award is named in honour of Marilyn Pomfret. Before her death in April 2019, she had spent 23 years at UBC, supporting the increase in funding and intramurals for women. Having worked as a coach, Pomfret also served as the Director of Women&#x27;s Athletics from 1963 to 1969, followed by a second stint from 1972 to 1986. In addition, she served in the role of president of the Women&#x27;s Athletic Directorate, creating and organizing several women&#x27;s sporting events. Prior to her administrative career, Pomfret was a student-athlete, arriving to UBC in 1951, participating in basketball and volleyball.

<doc id="382363" wikidata="Q28092" url="?curid=382363" title="Algonquin language">
<text>Algonquin (also spelled Algonkin; in Algonquin: &#x27; or &#x27;) is either a distinct Algonquian language closely related to the Ojibwe language or a particularly divergent Ojibwe dialect. It is spoken, alongside French and to some extent English, by the Algonquin First Nations of Quebec and Ontario. As of 2006, there were 2,680 Algonquin speakers, less than 10% of whom were monolingual. Algonquin is the language for which the entire Algonquian language subgroup is named; the similarity among the names often causes considerable confusion. Like many Native American languages, it is strongly verb-based, with most meaning being incorporated into verbs instead of using separate words for prepositions, tense, etc.

==Classification==

 (Algonquin) is an Algonquian language, of the Algic family of languages, and is descended from Proto-Algonquian. It is considered a particularly divergent dialect of Ojibwe by many. But, although the speakers call themselves &quot;Omàmìwininì or&quot; , the Ojibwe call them (&#x27;those at the end of the lake&#x27;). Among (Algonquins), however, the Nipissing are called (the Algonquin orthography for the Ojibwe ) and their language as . The rest of the Omàmìwininìmowin (Algonquin) communities call themselves (&#x27;down-stream men&#x27;), and the language (&#x27;speech of the down-stream men&#x27;).

Other than (Algonquin), languages considered as particularly divergent dialects of the Anishinaabe language include Mississauga (often called &quot;Eastern Ojibwe&quot;) and Odawa. The Potawatomi language was considered a divergent dialect of Anishinaabemowin (the Anishinaabe language) but now is considered a separate language. Culturally, (Algonquin) and the Michi Saagiig (Mississaugas) were not part of the Ojibwe–Odawa–Potawatomi alliance known as the Council of Three Fires. The (Algonquins) maintained stronger cultural ties with the Abenaki, Atikamekw and Cree.

Among sister Algonquian languages are Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Cree, Fox, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Shawnee. The Algic family contains the Algonquian languages and the so-called &quot;Ritwan&quot; languages, Wiyot and Yurok. Ojibwe and its similar languages are frequently referred to as a &quot;Central Algonquian&quot; language; however, Central Algonquian is an areal grouping rather than a genetic one. Among Algonquian languages, only the Eastern Algonquian languages constitute a true genetic subgroup.

The northern (Algonquin language) dialect of Anishinabemowin as spoken at Winneway, Quebec (Long Point), and Timiskaming First Nation, Quebec, is a similar dialect to the Oji-Cree dialect (Severn/Anishininimowin) of northwestern Ontario, despite being geographically separated by .

===Dialects===
There are several dialects of (the Algonquin language), generally grouped broadly as &quot;Northern Algonquin&quot; and &quot;Western Algonquin&quot;. Speakers at Kitigan Zibi consider their language to be &quot;Southern Algonquin&quot;, though linguistically it is a dialect of &quot;Nipissing Ojibwa&quot; which, together with &quot;Mississauga Ojibwa&quot; and &quot;Odawa&quot;, form the &quot;Nishnaabemwin (Eastern Ojibwa)&quot; group of the Ojibwa dialect continuum.

The consonant phonemes and major allophones of Algonquin in Cuoq spelling, one of several common orthographies, and its common variants are listed below (with IPA notation in brackets):


In an older orthography still popular in some of the Algonquin communities, known as the Malhiot () spelling, which the above Cuoq spelling was based upon, are listed below (with IPA notation in brackets):


====Aspiration and allophony====
The Algonquin consonants &quot;p&quot;, &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are unaspirated when they are pronounced between two vowels or after an &quot;m&quot; or &quot;n&quot;; plain voiceless and voiceless aspirated stops in Algonquin are thus allophones. So (&#x27;day&#x27;) is pronounced , but (&#x27;working day&#x27;) is pronounced .

===Vowels===

====Diphthongs====
====Nasal vowels====
Algonquin does have nasal vowels, but they are allophonic variants (similar to how in English vowels are sometimes nasalized before &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;). In Algonquin, vowels automatically become nasal before &quot;nd&quot;, &quot;ndj&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, &quot;nh&quot;, &quot;nhi&quot;, &quot;nj&quot; or &quot;nz&quot;. For example, (&#x27;fish&#x27;) is pronounced , not .

===Stress===
Word stress in Algonquin is complex but regular. Words are divided into iambic feet (an iambic foot being a sequence of one &quot;weak&quot; syllable plus one &quot;strong&quot; syllable), counting long vowels (&quot;à&quot;, &quot;è&quot;, &quot;ì&quot;, &quot;ò&quot;) as a full foot (a foot consisting of a single &quot;strong&quot; syllable). The primary stress is then normally on the strong syllable of the third foot from the end of the word—which, in words that are five syllables long or less, usually translates in practical terms to the first syllable (if it has a long vowel) or the second syllable (if not). The strong syllables of the remaining iambic feet each carry secondary stress, as do any final weak syllables. For example: , , , .

The Canadian University and College Ringette Association (CUCRA) is responsible for organizing university and college ringette in Canada.

The addition of the Dinos team was considered a significant step in the development of ringette by aiding in the development of a national intercollegiate ringette league and also gave post-secondary aged players opportunities they never previously had. The University of Calgary team competed in the Ringette Calgary league in what was then the Deb/Intermediate division. The team was coached by Beth Veale, Bob Kerr and Bruce Hammond. Beth Veale was considered the individual who was largely responsible for getting the program off the ground and getting success.

<text>The Western Mustangs are the athletic teams that represent Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. The school&#x27;s athletic program supports 46 varsity teams. Their mascot is a Mustang named J.W. and the school colours are purple and white. The university&#x27;s varsity teams compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference and the national U Sports organization. Western University offers 21 varsity sports for men and 19 for women which compete in the OUA conference. The university also offers cheerleading (co-ed and all-girls), women&#x27;s ringette, women&#x27;s softball, table tennis (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s) and ultimate frisbee (open-class and women&#x27;s), which compete outside the OUA conference, in sport-specific conferences and divisions.

The current athletic director is Christine Stapleton, who started at the university in 2017. Her predecessor, Therese Quigley, held the role for 8 years starting in 2009.

Many Western varsity programs lead Canadian universities in the number of championships won. The women&#x27;s volleyball team has won 10 provincial championships, the rowing team has won 23 provincial championships, the basketball teams have won 24 provincial championships, the football team has won 31 provincial championships and the men&#x27;s squash team has won 45 provincial championships, with 36 being consecutive. The Western Mustangs football team has won eight Vanier Cup national championships, in 1971, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1989, 1994, 2017 and 2021.

Additionally, the cheerleading team has won the national championship 33 times, including 24 consecutive. The university also has the largest university marching band in Canada.

==Varsity teams==

The University of Western Ontario&#x27;s Athletics program currently supports 26 varsity programs.

While technically not considered a varsity team, Western has a university ringette team which competes annually in the Canadian national University Challenge Cup.

=== Badminton ===
Badminton started in the early 1930s at Western as a club, but transitioned to a varsity sport once recognized in the OUA. The team consistently places in the top 3 during OUA championships, and has won 10 OUA championships, with the last one being in 2014.

During the 1970s, the team saw much acclaim. Jamie Paulson attended Western at this time and dominated in both singles and doubles at OUAA tournaments in the 1970–71 season, winning 33 out of 36 matches. This streak continued even after Paulson&#x27;s departure, and Western won the OUAA badminton championships in 1970–71, 1972–73, 1975–76, 1976–77, and 1977–78 seasons. More recently, former alumni Alex Bruce competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics as well as win a gold medal at the 2011 Pan American Games.

=== TD Stadium ===

The TD Stadium was built in 2000 and has a capacity of 8,000. It is the home of the Western Mustangs football team. The field size abides by CFL regulations and features an infill turf playing surface with a 2&quot; rubberized e-layer. Surrounding the field is an eight-lane, 400m outdoor track and long-jump pit.

=== Mustangs Field ===
Mustangs Field was opened in 2013 and acts as the playing surface for the soccer and lacrosse teams. The field can seat up to 600 people in the stand-alone bleachers.

=== Alumni Field ===
Alumni Field was opened in 2013 and is the primary field for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby teams. It is one of a few fields in Canada that is certified through the International Rugby Board. The field can seat up to 600 people in stand-alone bleachers.

=== Alumni Hall ===
Alumni Hall is a multi-sport auditorium and gym. It is currently has the playing court for the Western basketball and volleyball teams. It was originally opened in 1968 and is where the John P Metras Sports Museum is located. In addition to the main gymnasium, the lower floors of the building house the gym for the wrestling teams as well as a dance studio. There are several classroom facilities within the building. The Western Mustang Band is also housed in Alumni Hall.

In addition to the gym, the main auditorium has a large stage and is used as the primary location for convocation and other official University ceremonies. The auditorium can seat 1,200 in the mezzanine seats, and 2,274 total if additional chairs are set up on the court.

=== Thompson Arena and Indoor Track ===

The Thompson Arena was built in 1971 and has an NHL-sized ice rink as well as an indoor track around the rink. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams use the arena alongside the ringette and figure skating teams, while the track and field team use the 200m Mondo indoor track surface. The arena seating capacity is 3,615.

The indoor track is used primarily by sprinters, distance runners, throwers, and jumpers. During indoor track and field meets, the ice surface is covered and the inner rink becomes a field surface for activities such as pole vault and high jump. As of September 2019, the track was re-surfaced and updated. This update was following criticism on the previous track&#x27;s degrading condition and overuse.

The annual Don Wright track meet is hosted in the Thompson Arena.

=== Western Student Recreation Centre ===
The Western Student Recreation Centre (known as the Rec Centre or Western Rec) is a multi-level gymnasium facility and aquatic centre. It houses multiple basketball courts, volleyball courts, and squash courts, as well as a large fitness area with two floors of weight training equipment, treadmills, and fitness studios. The facility was opened in February 2009. It is directly attached to the Thompson Arena.

The Western varsity swim team and water polo team uses the 8-lane, 50m pool for training as well as hosting swim meets and competitions.

The Athletic Department offices and administration is housed within the Rec Centre.

This large facility comes as a result of a student-led initiative in 2006. Western students held a referendum to fund a majority of the building&#x27;s $35.7-million cost. From this, the undergraduate and graduate students pledged to donate a total of $101-million over 30 years for the initial purchase, building maintenance and support, with $14.8-million specifically funding undergraduate and graduate student bursaries. This was announced as the largest contribution ever from a student body to a Canadian university.

=== Thames Hall ===
Thames Hall was completed in 1949, led by planning and fundraising efforts of J. Howard Crocker, the director of the university&#x27;s physical education department.

Before the Western Rec Centre was completed in 2009, Thames Hall was the facility used for athletic department and had a pool, gymnasium, and athletic training facilities. After completion, Thames Hall was refurbished to convert the pool into classrooms. As of 2019, Thames Hall is undergoing major renovations and they are set to be complete June 2021. The newly renovated building will house Student Health and Psychological Services, Sports and Recreation, and Student Learning and Engagement, as well as house the Kinesiology department.

<doc id="382371" wikidata="Q62161" url="?curid=382371" title="McDonnell Douglas MD-11">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 is an American tri-jet wide-body airliner manufactured by American manufacturer McDonnell Douglas (MDC) and later by Boeing.

Following DC-10 development studies, the MD-11 program was launched on December 30, 1986. Assembly of the first prototype began on March 9, 1988. Its maiden flight occurred on January 10, 1990, and it achieved Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification on November 8. The first delivery was to Finnair on December 7 and it entered service on December 20, 1990.
It retains the basic trijet configuration of the DC-10 with updated GE CF6-80C2 or PW4000 turbofan engines. Its wingspan is slightly larger than the DC-10 and it has winglets. Its maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is increased by % to . Its fuselage is stretched by % to to accommodate 298 passengers in three classes over a range of up to . It features a glass cockpit that eliminates the need for a flight engineer.
Originally positioned as a longer-range alternative to rival twinjets, the existing Boeing 767 and the upcoming Boeing 777 and Airbus A330, the MD-11 initially failed to meet its range and fuel burn targets, which impacted its sales despite a performance improvement program. McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s finance struggles prevented further development of the MD-11 before it was acquired by Boeing in 1997; the unified company decided to terminate the MD-11 program after filling outstanding orders due to internal competition from Boeing&#x27;s own 767 and 777. Only 200 examples were built, of which roughly a quarter were freight aircraft, and production concluded in October 2000. In November 2014, it was officially retired from passenger service, last flown by KLM. Many of the MD-11 passenger fleet were converted to freighter specification, with many remaining in service as of 2025.

==Development==
===Origins===
Although the MD-11 program was launched in 1986, McDonnell Douglas had started to search for a DC-10 derivative as early as 1976. Two versions were considered then: a DC-10-10 with a fuselage stretch of and a DC-10-30 stretched by . The latter version would have been capable of transporting up to 340 passengers in a multi-class configuration, or 277 passengers and their luggage over . At the same time, the manufacturer was seeking to reduce wing and engine drag on the trijet. Another version of the aircraft was also envisaged, the &quot;DC-10 global&quot;, aimed to counter the risks of loss of orders for the DC-10-30 that the Boeing 747SP and its range were causing. The DC-10 global would have incorporated more fuel tanks.

While continuing their research for a new aircraft, McDonnell Douglas designated the program DC-10 Super 60, previously known for a short time as DC-10 Super 50. The Super 60 was to be an intercontinental aircraft incorporating many aerodynamic improvements in the wings, and a fuselage lengthened by to allow for up to 350 passengers to be seated in a mixed-class layout, compared to 275 in the same configuration of the DC-10.

Following more refinements, in 1979 the DC-10 Super 60 was proposed in three distinct versions like the DC-8. The DC-10-61 was designed to be a high-capacity medium-range aircraft. It would have a fuselage stretch of over the earlier DC-10 models, enabling it to carry 390 passengers in a mixed class or 550 passengers in an all-economy layout, similar to Boeing&#x27;s later 777-300 and Airbus A340-600. Like the DC-8, the series 62 was proposed for long-range routes. It would feature a more modest fuselage stretch of , along with an increased wingspan and fuel capacity. It would be capable of carrying up to 350 passengers (mixed class) or 440 passengers (all-economy), similar to the later Boeing 777-200 or the Airbus A330-300/A340-300/500. Finally, the series 63 would have incorporated the same fuselage as the DC-10-61 as well as the larger wing of the -62. After high-profile accidents in the 1970s, such as Turkish Airlines Flight 981 and American Airlines Flight 191, the trijet&#x27;s reputation was seriously damaged by doubts regarding its structural integrity. For these reasons, and due to a downturn in the airline industry, all work on the Super 60 was stopped.
In August 1981, a Continental Airlines DC-10-10 (registration number N68048) was leased to conduct more research, particularly on the effects the newly designed winglets would have on aircraft performance. Different types of winglets were tested during that time in conjunction with NASA at the McDonnell Douglas flight test facility in Yuma, Arizona and Edwards Air Force Base. McDonnell Douglas was again planning new DC-10 versions that could incorporate winglets and more efficient engines developed at the time by Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW2037) and Rolls-Royce (RB.211-535F4). The manufacturer finally rationalized all these studies under the MD-EEE (Ecology-Economy-Efficiency) designation, which was later modified to the MD-100 following some more changes. The MD-100 was proposed in two versions: the Series 10, having an airframe shorter by compared to the DC-10 and seating up to 270 passengers in a mixed-class configuration; and the Series 20, incorporating a fuselage stretch of over the DC-10 and able to seat up to 333 passengers in the same kind of configuration as the Series 10. Both versions could be powered by the same engine families as the actual MD-11 plus the RB.211-600. However, the situation for the manufacturer, and the airline industry in general, did not look bright. No new DC-10 orders were received, and many observers and customers doubted that the manufacturer would stay in business much longer. Thus, the board of directors decided in November 1983 to once again cease all work on the projected new trijet.

The following year no new orders for the DC-10 were received. The production line was kept active thanks to earlier orders from the U.S. Air Force for 60 KC-10A tankers. McDonnell Douglas was still convinced that a new derivative for the DC-10 was needed, as shown by the second-hand market for their Series 30 and the heavier DC-10-30ER version. Thus, in 1984 a new derivative aircraft version of the DC-10 was designated MD-11. From the very beginning, the MD-11X was conceived in two different versions. The MD-11X-10, based on a DC-10-30 airframe, offered a range of with passengers. That first version would have had a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of and would have used CF6-80C2 or PW4000 engines. The MD-11X-20 was to have a longer fuselage, accommodating up to 331 passengers in a mixed-class layout, and a range of .

As more orders for the DC-10 were received, McDonnell Douglas used the time gained before the end of DC-10 production to consult with potential customers and to refine the proposed new trijet. In July 1985, the board of directors authorized the Long Beach plant to offer the MD-11 to potential customers. At the time, the aircraft was still proposed in two versions, both with the same fuselage length, a stretch of over the DC-10 airframe, as well as the same engine choice as the MD-11X. One version would have a range of with a gross weight of and transport up to 337 passengers, while the second would carry 331 passengers over . A year later, as several airlines had committed to the MD-11, the situation was looking optimistic. The aircraft was now a 320-seater baseline and defined as an stretch over the DC-10-30 powered by the new advanced turbofans offered by the major engine manufacturers giving it a range of . Other versions, such as a shortened ER with a range of , an all-cargo offering a maximum payload of , and a Combi with a provision for ten freight pallets on the main deck, were proposed. Further growth of the aircraft was also foreseen, such as the MD-11 Advanced.
The lack of innovation from McDonnell Douglas during the MD-11&#x27;s design had been attributed to the company&#x27;s declining cash flow, as it struggled with problems with its military contracts and declining orders for its commercial jets. Limited company resources resulted in the MD-11 being developed as a refinement of the existing DC-10, in contrast to rivals Airbus and Boeing who during this period developed all-new aircraft designs that would become the Airbus A330/A340 and Boeing 777. As a trijet, the MD-11 was less fuel-efficient but had a greater range than its mid-size widebody contemporaries which were twinjets (the existing Boeing 767 and the upcoming Airbus A330 and Boeing 777). Aerospace consultant Scott Hamilton, in a 2014 article, said that the MD-11 was &quot;classically ill-timed&quot; as &quot;it came at the end of the three- or four-engine era, just ahead of the real move to ETOPS with the 777&quot;. McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s initiative to &quot;outsource everything but design, final assembly, and flight testing and sales of the MD-11&quot; was also seen as contributing to the end of their commercial airline business.

===Launch and costs===
On December 30, 1986, McDonnell Douglas launched the MD-11 with commitments for 52 firm orders and 40 options in three different versions (passenger, combi and freighter) from ten airlines (Alitalia, British Caledonian, Dragonair, Federal Express, Finnair, Korean Air, Scandinavian Airlines, Swissair, Thai Airways International, and VARIG) and two leasing companies (Guinness Peat Aviation and Mitsui). Orders from Dragonair, Scandinavian, and UTA, an undisclosed customer, were canceled by 1988.

In 1987, the program was to cost $1.5 billion (equivalent to $ in ) with $500 million for development and almost $1 billion for tooling and inventory. The first 52 firm orders totaled $5 billion, or $95 million each, while the A340 sold for $67 million. At certification in 1990, $2.5 billion were invested in initial production inventory, and $700 million for engineering, tools, and flight testing. While it was selling for $100 million, the initial MD-11 jets cost $120 to $150 million to produce but this was to reduce to $90 million with manufacturing experience over the program life for an 11% gross profit margin, less than the 15% to 20% Boeing obtains.

In 1992, the $1.7 billion development cost was to be spread over the first 301 aircraft produced for $100 million each. In 1995, because costs and revenues could not be reasonably estimated over the program life, MDC took a pre-tax charge of $1.838 billion (~$ in ) for deferred production costs and for reduced support and tooling value. In 1999, the unit cost was $132-$147.5 million (equivalent to $-$ million in dollars).

===Production and performance issues===
Assembly of the first MD-11 began on March 9, 1988, at McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s Douglas Products Division in Long Beach, California, and the mating of the fuselage with wings occurred in October of that year. The first flight was originally planned to occur in March 1989, but numerous problems with the manufacturing, delays with suppliers producing essential components, and labor industrial actions delayed the ceremonial rollout of the prototype until September of that year.

Parts for the MD-11 were sourced from a global network of subcontractors and suppliers. Subassembly tasks were spread across the McDonnell Douglas Corporation: the nose subassembly was produced in St. Louis, Missouri, the control surface assembly in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the structural rings fabricated in Torrance, California. The wings were manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Canada in Malton, Ontario, near Toronto&#x27;s Lester B Pearson International Airport, before being shipped to Long Beach. Main fuselage sections for the MD-11, and previously for DC-10, KC-10 were built by General Dynamics&#x27; Convair Division in San Diego, which were transported by barge to Long Beach Harbor and then by truck to the assembly plant.

The following months of 1989 were used to prepare the prototype for its maiden flight, which finally happened on January 10, 1990. The first two aircraft manufactured were intended for FedEx and thus, were already fitted with the forward side cargo door. They remained with the manufacturer as test aircraft until 1991 before being completely converted to freighters and delivered to their customer. FAA certification was achieved on November 8, 1990, while the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) certified the MD-11 on October 17, 1991, after approximately 200 separate issues were resolved. Yugoslav Airlines, already flying several DC-10s, became the first customer of the MD-11. Three aircraft were manufactured but were never delivered due to the Yugoslav Wars. The first MD-11 was delivered to Finnair on December 7, 1990, and it accomplished the first revenue service by an MD-11 on December 20, 1990, carrying passengers from Helsinki to Tenerife in the Canary Islands. MD-11 service in the U.S. was inaugurated by Delta Air Lines the following year.

It was during this period that flaws in the MD-11&#x27;s performance became apparent. It failed to meet its targets for range and fuel burn. American Airlines in particular was unimpressed with the 19 MD-11s that it received, as was Singapore Airlines who canceled their order for 20 MD-11s and instead ordered 20 Airbus A340-300s. American Airlines cited problems with the performance of the engines and airframe, while Singapore Airlines stated that the MD-11 could not operate on the airline&#x27;s long-haul routes. Pre-flight estimates indicated that the P&amp;W-powered MD-11 was to have a range with of payload. With the Phase 1 drag reduction in place, the aircraft could only achieve its full range with of payload, or a reduced range of with a full payload.

In 1990, McDonnell Douglas, along with Pratt &amp; Whitney and General Electric began a modification program known as the Performance Improvement Program (PIP) to improve the aircraft&#x27;s weight, fuel capacity, engine performance, and aerodynamics. McDonnell Douglas worked with NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center to study aerodynamic improvements. The PIP lasted until 1995 and recovered the range for the aircraft. In 1995, American Airlines sold its 19 MD-11s to FedEx, as the PIP program was not sufficient for the aircraft to fly the Dallas–Fort Worth-Hong Kong route.

Despite the PIP, sales of the MD-11 had already been significantly impacted. Prospective MD-11 customers instead selected the Boeing 767 and 777, or the Airbus A330 in large numbers. These aforementioned twinjets soon received extended-range variants (767-300ER, 777-200ER, and A330-200) that nullified the MD-11&#x27;s remaining advantage over the initial shorter-range versions, while remaining more fuel efficient than the trijet MD-11 and quadjet A340. Airbus, which only had somewhat better success with the initial A340-200/300 than McDonnell Douglas with the MD-11, decided to invest into the next generation A340-500/600 (that would also distinguish it from the A330-200), while Boeing would follow suit with the second-generation 777-300ER/200LR which proved more successful. A further development of the MD-11 to keep pace with Airbus and Boeing&#x27;s developments, the MD-XX program which would have resulted in an MD-XX Stretch and MD-XX LR, was too financially costly for a struggling McDonnell Douglas.
After McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing in 1997, in order to avoid internal competition with the Boeing 767 and 777, the unified company decided that MD-11 production would continue exclusively with the freighter variant. In 1998, Boeing announced it would end MD-11 production after filling orders on hand due to lack of sufficient market demand. The last passenger MD-11 built was delivered to Sabena in April 1998. Assembly of the last two MD-11s were completed in August and October 2000; they were delivered to Lufthansa Cargo on February 22 and January 25, 2001, respectively. McDonnell Douglas originally had projected that it would sell more than 300 MD-11 aircraft, but only 200 were built.

The MD-11 assembly plant in Long Beach, California later became Boeing&#x27;s facility and manufactured the C-17 Globemaster III until 29 November 2015.

=== Planned retirements ===
FedEx plans to completely phase out its fleet of MD-11s by 2028. UPS plans to retire their MD-11s and replace them with Boeing 767-300Fs in the years to come but has not decided on an exact date. FedEx has retired 51 out of the 82 MD-11s they have received with 30 active and 1 parked. UPS has retired 20 out of the 49 MD-11s they have received with 29 active. Western Global Airlines has five remaining active MD-11s, having retired 14.

==Design==
The MD-11 is a medium- to long-range widebody airliner, with two engines mounted on underwing pylons and a third engine at the base of the vertical stabilizer, which has a two-segment rudder for directional control. It is based on the DC-10 but features a stretched fuselage, increased wingspan winglets, refined airfoils on the wing and tailplane resulting in a reduced wetted area and form drag, new engines, and increased use of composites. The most significant change in the tail section is the MD-11&#x27;s horizontal tail being 30% smaller than that of the DC-10-30. The horizontal tail area on the DC-10 is 1,338 square feet (120 square meters), while on the MD-11, it&#x27;s reduced to 920 square feet (82.8 square meters). The MD11&#x27;s winglets are credited with improving fuel efficiency by about 2.5%. The MD-11 has a smaller empennage than the DC-10 it is based upon.
The MD-11 features a two-crew cockpit that incorporates six 8-inch interchangeable cathode-ray tube (CRT) display units and advanced Honeywell VIA 2000 computers. The cockpit design is called Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) and is shared with the Boeing 717. Flight deck features include an Electronic Instrument System, a dual Flight Management System, a Central Fault Display System, and a Global Positioning System. Category IIIB automatic landing capability for bad-weather operations and Future Air Navigation Systems (FANS) are available.

The MD-11 had a neutral stability design and one of the first commercial designs to employ a computer-assisted pitch/longitudinal stability augmentation system (LSAS) that featured a fuel ballast tank in the tailplane, and a partly computer-driven horizontal stabilizer, to compensate for the comparatively short horizontal stabilizer. Updates to the software package made the airplane&#x27;s handling characteristics in manual flight similar to those of the DC-10, despite a smaller tailplane to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency.

The MD-11 incorporates hydraulic fuses not included in the initial DC-10 design, to prevent catastrophic loss of control in the event of a hydraulic failure such as that which occurred on United Airlines Flight 232.

==Variants==
The MD-11 was manufactured in five variants.
*MD-11 (131 built): the passenger variant, was produced from 1988 to 1998. It was the first version on offer at the aircraft&#x27;s launch in 1986 and was delivered to American Airlines (19), Delta Air Lines (17), Swissair (16), Japan Airlines (10), KLM (10), and other airlines with fewer aircraft.
*MD-11C (five built): this combi aircraft was the third variant on offer at launch in 1986 and was designed to accommodate both passengers and freight on the main deck, which featured a rear cargo compartment for up to ten pallets, each measuring or . The main deck cargo compartment was accessible by a large rear port-side cargo door, which measured . The main deck cargo volume was . Additional freight was also carried in below-deck compartments. The MD-11C could also be configured as an all-passenger aircraft. All five aircraft were manufactured between 1991 and 1992 and delivered to Alitalia, the only customer for that variant. In 2005 and 2006 the airline converted them to full-freighter configurations to be operated by Alitalia&#x27;s cargo division. Following that division&#x27;s closure, the five aircraft were returned to their lessor in January 2009.
* MD-11CF (six built): the Convertible Freighter variant was launched in 1991 by an order from Martinair for three aircraft plus two options. The MD-11CF features a large forward port-side cargo door () located between the first doors and can be used in an all-passenger or in an all-cargo configuration. As a freighter, it can transport 26 pallets of the same dimensions () or ) as for the MD-11C and MD-11F for a main-deck cargo volume of and offers a maximum payload of . All six MD-11CFs were delivered to Martinair (four) and World Airways (two) in 1995. The two World Airways aircraft were converted to freight-only in 2002.
* MD-11ER (five built): the Extended Range version was launched by the manufacturer at the Singapore Air Show in February 1994. The MD-11ER incorporates all the Performance Improvement Program (PIP) options, including a maximum takeoff weight of and an extra fuel tank of ) in the forward cargo hold to offer a range of , an increase of over the standard passenger variant. MD-11ERs were delivered between 1995 and 1997 to Garuda Indonesia (three) and World Airways (two). As of February 2007, only one Finnair MD-11ER has been converted to MD-11 with the removal of the extra fuel tank.
*MD-11F (53 built): The freight transport aircraft was the second variant on offer at launch in 1986 and was the last and longest (1988–2000) manufactured version. The all-cargo aircraft features the same forward port-side cargo door () as the MD-11CF, a main-deck volume of , a maximum payload of and can transport 26 pallets of the same dimensions ( or ) as for the MD-11C and MD-11CF. The MD-11F was delivered between 1991 and 2001 to FedEx Express (22), Lufthansa Cargo (14), and other airlines with fewer aircraft.
*MD-11 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) – Boeing and its group of international affiliates offer a conversion of used passenger airliners into freighters. The MD-11BCF is one of the models offered.

Note: Some or all the features of the MD-11ER, including the higher MTOW of , part or all of the PIPs aerodynamic improvements packages and composite panels were fitted to later-built MD-11s (except the extra fuel tank), and could be retrofitted to any of the variants, except for the PIP Phase IIIB larger aft-engine intake. Some airlines, such as Finnair, Martinair, and FedEx have made the structural changes required to allow their aircraft to have the higher MTOW. Swissair&#x27;s 16 newest aircraft were retrofitted with all the features except for the extra fuel tank and were so-designated MD-11AH for Advanced Heavy.

===Proposed tanker version===
After McDonnell Douglas did the KDC-10 conversion for the Royal Netherlands Air Force in 1992, they proposed a tanker/transport version of the MD-11CF which had the in-house designation KMD-11. McDD offered either conversion of second-hand aircraft (KMD-11) or new built aircraft (KC-10B), the proposed KMD-11 offered 35,000 lbs more cargo capacity and 8,400 lbs more transferable fuel than the KC-10A. It was offered to the RNAF and Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) in the 1990s and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in the early 2000s.

===Undeveloped variants===
In 1993, 1995, and again in 1996, McDonnell Douglas performed studies on the feasibility of a twin-engine jet using MD-11 components, but nothing came of any of them. In August 1997, just after the merger with Boeing, a presentation was made pitching an MD-11 twin with a new Boeing wing to fill the gap between the 767 and the 777, but again the proposal came to nothing, as it had nothing in common with other Boeing airliners in terms of production nor pilot type rating.

After ending the MD-12 program, McDonnell Douglas focused on 300–400-seat MD-11 derivatives. At the 1996 Farnborough International Air Show, the company presented plans for a new tri-jet with high seating and long range named &quot;MD-XX&quot;. It was offered in the MD-XX Stretch and MD-XX LR versions. The MD-XX Stretch version was to have a longer fuselage than the MD-11 and seat 375 in a typical three-class arrangement. The MD-XX LR was to have a longer range and be the same length as the MD-11; it was to have typical three-class seating for 309. However, the MDC board of directors decided to end the MD-XX program in October 1996, because the financial investment was too large for the company.

==Operators==

As of December 2024, 67 of the 200 aircraft built are operational, serving three different cargo operators worldwide.
Most of the airlines that ordered the MD-11 for their long-haul passenger flights had replaced it with Airbus A330, A340, and Boeing 777 aircraft by the end of 2004. Some carriers converted their MD-11s to freighters such as China Eastern Airlines and Korean Air. Korean Air announced as early as December 1994 its intention to convert its MD-11s to freighters for medium-range cargo routes. In 1995, American Airlines agreed to sell its 19 aircraft to FedEx, transferring the first MD-11 in 1996. Japan Airlines (JAL) announced the replacement of its 10 MD-11s in 2000; these aircraft were being converted into freighters and sold to UPS in 2004.

In February 2007, TAM Linhas Aéreas began operating the first of three leased passenger MD-11s, in a deal arranged by Boeing as an interim solution for TAM to quickly be able to operate newly granted intercontinental routes while waiting for four Boeing 777-300ERs to be delivered from late 2008. The last MD-11 was retired from TAM&#x27;s fleet in July 2009, which ended its use by Brazilian airlines (Varig, VASP, and TAM).

In May 2007, Finnair announced the sale of their last two MD-11s to Aeroflot-Cargo to become part of the Russian airline cargo fleet in 2008 and 2009. KLM was the last airline to operate scheduled passenger flights with the passenger version of the MD-11. The final scheduled flight took place on October 26, 2014, from Montréal to Amsterdam, followed by three special roundtrip flights on November 11, 2014. Lufthansa Cargo retired their last MD-11 on October 17, 2021.

Two MD-11s were also operated in a VIP configuration, one by Saudia Royal Flight for members of the Royal family, and one by Mid East Jet for ASACO Aviation; both are now stored.

==Accidents and incidents==
As of March 2024, the MD-11 has been involved in 49 aviation incidents, including ten hull-loss accidents with 244 fatalities.

===Notable accidents and incidents===
*On April 6, 1993, China Eastern Airlines Flight 583, an MD-11 went into severe oscillations when a crew member accidentally deployed the slats while cruising over the Pacific Ocean near the Aleutian Islands. Two passengers were seriously injured and later died.

*On July 31, 1997, FedEx Express Flight 14, MD-11 N611FE, crashed during a landing at Newark Liberty International Airport, New Jersey. The aircraft flipped onto its back and subsequently burned, following a landing attempt from an unstabilized flare. The five occupants survived with injuries.
*On September 2, 1998, Swissair Flight 111, a MD-11 registered as HB-IWF, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near Halifax, Nova Scotia while en route from New York City to Geneva, Switzerland. All of the 229 passengers and crew on board died. The cause of the crash was determined to have been a fire caused by improper wiring of passenger entertainment system units added by Swissair. The fire started at the front of the aircraft and quickly grew uncontrollable, attributed partly to the poor flame retardant properties of its metalized mylar insulation.
*On April 15, 1999, Korean Air Cargo Flight 6316, MD-11 registration number HL7373, crashed shortly after takeoff while operating cargo flight KE6316 from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport to Seoul. After takeoff, the flight was cleared to climb to . The aircraft climbed to . Due to confusion on the flight deck, the captain thought the aircraft was too high and needed to descend. The captain pushed the control column abruptly forward, causing the MD-11 to enter a rapid descent from which it could not be recovered. All three occupants on board and five people on the ground were killed.
*On August 22, 1999, China Airlines Flight 642, an MD-11 operated by subsidiary Mandarin Airlines, crashed while landing at Hong Kong International Airport during Tropical Storm Sam that exceeded its crosswind specifications, also flipping onto its back and burning. Three passengers were killed.
*On October 17, 1999, FedEx Express Flight 87, MD-11 N581FE, was written off after landing at Subic Bay International Airport, Philippines. The aircraft was operating from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. Upon landing, the aircraft rolled down the whole length of the runway before plunging into the bay where it was completely submerged except for the cockpit. An excessive approach and landing speed were pointed out as probable cause of the accident.
*On March 23, 2009, FedEx Express Flight 80, MD-11F N526FE, crashed at Narita International Airport, Japan while landing in windy conditions. Airport surveillance video showed the aircraft becoming airborne again after the first touchdown, then impacting nose-first the second time and turning onto its left side, erupting into flames; the impact flipped the aircraft upside-down. The aircraft finally came to rest some distance left of the runway. The two flight crew members were killed.
*On November 28, 2009, Avient Aviation Flight 324, MD-11F Z-BAV (c/n 48408), crashed on takeoff from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on a flight to Bishkek-Manas International Airport, Kyrgyzstan with the loss of three lives. The aircraft was written off.
*On July 27, 2010, Lufthansa Cargo Flight 8460, an MD-11F, crash-landed at King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The captain and first officer evacuated the aircraft with injuries. This incident is very similar to FedEx Flight 80 and FedEx Flight 14.
*On February 13, 2016, Western Global Airlines Flight 4425 was involved in a stowaway incident that was discovered when the plane had stopped in Harare Airport, Zimbabwe for a fuel stop en route to King Shaka International Airport, South Africa from Munich, Germany. The deceased stowaway was located in the plane&#x27;s cargo hold after ground staff at Harare noticed blood dripping from one of the MD-11&#x27;s cargo doors. The crew initially stated that they believed the blood to have come from a bird strike which had been noticed by ground staff at Munich Airport earlier in the plane&#x27;s journey, but the body of a man who had stowed away on the flight was discovered shortly after in the cargo hold of the plane and its crew were seized by Zimbabwean authorities.
*On June 6, 2016, UPS Airlines Flight 61, MD-11F N277UP suffered a runway excursion and nose gear collapse in a takeoff accident at Seoul-Incheon International Airport (ICN). Takeoff from runway 33L was aborted and the aircraft continued past the end of the runway. The nose gear collapsed and the no.1 and 3 engines contacted the grass. The flight was bound for Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. All 4 crew members survived without injury. The aircraft was written off.
===Safety problems===
The MD-11 had problems with its flight control systems that have resulted in multiple accidents and incidents since the aircraft&#x27;s introduction. The initial design of the slat/flap lever in the cockpit left it prone to being accidentally dislodged by a crew in flight. The defect has been corrected since 1992. In the early 2000s, Boeing improved the flight control software at the urging of the FAA to reduce the possibility of violent unintentional pitch movements.

To improve fuel efficiency, McDonnell Douglas designed the MD-11&#x27;s center of gravity to be much farther aft than that of other commercial aircraft. There was also a fuel-ballast tank in the MD-11&#x27;s horizontal stabilizer since its tailplane was smaller than the DC-10&#x27;s to improve fuel efficiency, but this was found to inhibit the MD-11&#x27;s crosswind performance. These design features, coupled with standard landing speeds faster than those of comparable aircraft, significantly reduce the MD-11&#x27;s margin for error during the takeoff and landing phases, making it more difficult to handle than the smaller DC-10. Several operators have introduced special training to assist crews in safely handling the MD-11&#x27;s critical phases of flight.

<text>The Queen&#x27;s Gaels (also known as the Queen&#x27;s Golden Gaels) is the athletics program representing Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The main athletics facilities include Richardson Memorial Stadium, the Queen&#x27;s Athletics and Recreation Centre, Nixon Field and Tindall Field. The team colours are gold, blue, and red.

Queen&#x27;s teams have had a variety of successes both provincially and nationally. Their most recent U Sports National Championship was awarded to the Women&#x27;s rugby program, who hoisted the Monilex Trophy on home soil at Nixon Field in 2021.

The Gaels football team is one of the oldest and most successful in Canada, including three straight Grey Cup victories in 1922, 1923, and 1924 and four Vanier Cup victories in 1968, 1978, 1992, and 2009. Queen&#x27;s University hockey teams have competed on three occasions as Stanley Cup finalists in 1895, 1899, and 1906.

The Gaels have also won the 2010–11 U Sports Men&#x27;s Curling Championship and the women&#x27;s soccer team has won the national championship in 1988, 2010, and 2011.

The fight song is known as &quot;Oil Thigh&quot; which was written in 1891 and features Gaelic lyrics which can be heard at many sporting events. The mascot is Boo Hoo the Bear.

==Name==
Prior to 1947, Queen&#x27;s teams were commonly referred to as &quot;The Tricolour.&quot;

The &quot;Golden Gaels&quot; name was coined in 1947 by Kingston Whig-Standard sports reporter Cliff Bowering, after the football team traded its traditional uniform of red, gold, and blue bands for gold jerseys, gold helmets, and red pants. The name caught on and became the familiar term for Queen&#x27;s teams by the 1950s. &quot;Gaels&quot; is a reference to Queen&#x27;s Scottish heritage (Queen&#x27;s University was established in 1841 by the Presbyterian church).

In September 2008, Queen&#x27;s Athletics &amp; Recreation Department began referring to the school&#x27;s teams as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Gaels.&quot; Along with this change, the website was changed from goldengaels.com to gogaelsgo.com. The change was reportedly made to highlight the university&#x27;s name in promoting the team; however, some have criticized the move as &quot;change for the sake of change.&quot; Under media scrutiny, the department claimed it had not in fact officially changed the name of the team; thus, local media sources like the &quot;Kingston Whig-Standard&quot; and CKWS-TV continue to refer to the team as the &quot;Golden Gaels&quot;.

== Varsity teams ==

===Basketball===
Men&#x27;s

Queen&#x27;s hosted McGill University at the Kingston YMCA on February 6, 1904, in the first-ever Canadian interuniversity basketball game. McGill won 9–7, after a ten-minute overtime period to break a 7–7 tie. The Queen&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team attended their first ever U SPORTS National Championship in 2022 after upsetting the undefeated Carleton Ravens in the OUA semi-final.

Women&#x27;s

The Queen&#x27;s Gaels women&#x27;s basketball team had their strongest finish ever in 2021–22, placing third at the U SPORTS Final 8 tournament which took place at the Athletics &amp; Recreation Centre on Queen&#x27;s Campus.

=== Cross Country ===
The Queen&#x27;s Gaels have a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country and distance track program which continually ranks highly on the national rankings. In 2021–22, the Gaels ranked 6th in the country for the men&#x27;s program and 8th in the country for the women&#x27;s program.

=== Football ===
The Queen&#x27;s Gaels football program is one of the longest-lived and storied in Canada. The team began organized play in 1883 when the Ontario Rugby Football Union was first founded and won ORFU champions in 1893 and 1894. Queen&#x27;s has competed continuously since 1882, celebrating its 125th anniversary in 2007. The first organized university football league in Canada, the Canadian Intercollegiate Rugby Football Union (CIRFU), was founded in Kingston in November, 1897, with charter members Queen&#x27;s, McGill University, and the University of Toronto., the football squad showed continued success, winning three straight Grey Cups in 1922, 1923 and 1924. When the Grey Cup transitioned from amateur competition to the professional Canadian Football League in 1955, the Gaels turned their attention to the Vanier Cup, appearing in the U Sports championship game five times and winning four of those games in 1968, 1978, 1992 and 2009.

===Ice hockey===
====Men&#x27;s====
In 1886, Queen&#x27;s challenged the Royal Military College of Canada to a game played on the frozen Kingston harbour; the two schools play annually for the Carr-Harris Cup, to continue the world&#x27;s oldest hockey rivalry. Queen&#x27;s hockey is one of the oldest hockey clubs in the world; only McGill University&#x27;s team, started in 1875, is older among Canadian university teams. Queen&#x27;s played its first season in 1883–84, with the first game for which records exist played against a team from Petawawa.

In the 1890s, Queen&#x27;s played in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA), winning its championship three times consecutively, taking the Cosby Cup into its permanent possession. Queen&#x27;s won the inaugural J. Ross Robertson Cup during the 1898–99 season, as the senior ice hockey champion of the OHA. As Ontario champion, the Queen&#x27;s hockey team was a regular in Stanley Cup Challenge Games by challenging in 1895, 1899 and 1906.

Queen&#x27;s donated the Queen&#x27;s Cup for annual Ontario University Athletics competition in 1898. In 1902, the Intercollegiate Hockey Union was formed and the Gaels won the title in 1904 and 1906. In 1909, Queen&#x27;s won the Intercollegiate league and then won the Allan Cup national championship by defeating the Ottawa Cliffsides in a challenge. The 1910 team won the Allan Cup for a second time by winning the Intercollegiate title and a challenge before losing the Cup in a second challenge to Toronto St. Michael&#x27;s.

Queen&#x27;s operated a junior ice hockey team during the 1920s in the OHA. The junior team won the J. Ross Robertson Cup as the provincial champions in 1926, and had been finalists in 1921. Queen&#x27;s reached the 1926 Memorial Cup finals, but lost to the Calgary Canadians for the national championship.

The varsity teams play at the Kingston Memorial Centre following the demolition of the Jock Harty Arena.

In 2018–19, the Gaels won their first Queen&#x27;s Cup in 38 years, 4–1 over Guelph Gryphons in front of a 2,900 people at the Kingston Memorial Centre.

===Rugby===

====Men&#x27;s====
The men&#x27;s rugby team is regarded as one of the most successful rugby programs in Ontario, and has won the OUA a record 23 times. Their home games are played on Nixon Field, at the heart of Queen&#x27;s University campus, and crowds often top 2,000 spectators.

Men&#x27;s rugby is not a U SPORTS designated sport, therefore they compete in a similar non-sanctioned format called the Canadian University Men&#x27;s Rugby Championship (CUMRC).

The team won the OUA Championship in 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Other dynasties include the late 80s.

The team is currently coached by Dave Butcher, who took over from Gary Gilks and Peter Huigenbos in 2017.

Nationally capped players that have come through the program are current national captain, Lucas Rumball, Alistair Clark, Sean Duke, Dan Moor, Kainoa Lloyd and Matt Beukeboom.

Women&#x27;s

The women&#x27;s rugby program holds a very similar regard in the U SPORTS women&#x27;s rugby scene, most notably winning the 2021 U SPORTS National Championship on home soil at Nixon Field.

The program has developed numerous national team athletes including Sophie de Goede, Chloe Daniels, McKinley Hunt and many more.

In OUA competition, the program has won the OUA Championship twice; in 2013 and 2019.

===Fencing===
The Queen’s Varsity Fencing Club (QFC) is a volunteer- and student-run university varsity club. It maintains a safe space for recreational and competitive student-athletes to take part in the sport of fencing. QFC provides a positive and supportive environment for fencers to perform to the best of their ability with emphasis on personal development, leadership, scholarship, and competitive opportunity.

===Track and field===
Track and field is reported as the first sport at Queen&#x27;s University. It began in 1873, as competitions held annually to celebrate the university&#x27;s inauguration on October 16 and included traditional Scottish competitions such as the caber toss. These competitions remained major university events into the early 20th century.

When the CIAU (now U Sports) began, the Queen&#x27;s University track and field team was one of the only teams to participate in all three athletics sports – indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, and cross-country.

In 1963, Rolf Lund was named head coach of the team, marking a turning point in the team&#x27;s history. Through the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the Queen&#x27;s track and field team saw many successful athletes. Some notable athletes include Olympians Sheridon Baptiste, Anne Marie Malone, Victor Gooding, school 1500m record holder Bob McCormack, and past head coach and multiple CIS champion Melody Torcalacci.

===Sailing===
Co-ed

====Early days====
Sailing began as a competitive sport for Queen&#x27;s in 1937 when the first regatta for Canadian universities was sponsored in Kingston. For many years Queen&#x27;s Sailing operated as an AMS student club, unaffiliated with Queen’s Athletics. As such, in any given year the club existed based solely on the initiative of individuals attending the university. This resulted in ad hoc continuity from year-to-year with the club sometimes thriving and other times not. The governance structure was informal and membership, practice and regatta participation was done on a word-of-mouth basis. In those days there was no such thing as ‘tryouts’ or team ‘officials&#x27;. If you were a sailor or interested in sailing and were available, you competed. For the early years, funding was minimal and students paid much of the costs themselves. Regattas were typically no more than a car-drive away. Royal Military College (RMC), who had a fleet of small boats with a boathouse and regatta facilities, were generous in sharing these for practice and competitions. Races were often held in Kingston because of this, however sometimes entailed a road-trip to Toronto or Montreal and sometimes farther afield in Canada or to inter-collegiate regattas in Boston, Annapolis and elsewhere in New England.

In the late 1970&#x27;s, still operating as a club, Queen&#x27;s sailing caught the eye of Dr. Ronald Watts, Principal and Vice-Chancellor; and also a keen lifelong sailor. Dr. Watts helped increase the visibility of the team/club within the university sports community. This facilitated approval for athlete funds to offset some of the costs to compete. The Queen&#x27;s sailing team began participating in more U.S. Intercollegiate Sailing Association (ICSA) regattas. The increased visibility and access to sailboats at RMC also helped promote more participation by New England Universities in Kingston regattas. The success and broadened participation by Queen&#x27;s in these years led to their ranking in the top 10 amongst all ICSA universities. In 1977 and again in 1979 Terry McLaughlin, Queen&#x27;s BA ‘79, was recognized as an All-American ICSA member. The successful performance of Queen&#x27;s sailing club created a reputation amongst young sailors ready for university. It wasn’t abnormal to hear from students that the opportunity to participate on Queen&#x27;s sailing team was an incentive to attend university there.

At some point in the 80s sailing at Queen’s faded. Whether this was a result of access to boats at RMC, a lack of funding, or other is unclear. This ebbing of interest began to turn around in the late 80’s and by 1992 things had changed. In that year, student funding through an optional AMS fee, and in particular the accumulation of alumni donations into the Queen’s Sailing Team Account allowed the team to purchase a membership at the Kingston Yacht Club (KYC) and enter into a cost-sharing arrangement with Kingston Yacht Club for the purchase of 10 new 420 sailboats. This resurgence brought more organization and formality than the team had known previously. Recruitment, tryouts and coaching became some of the new norms for the club. Along with the creation of executive positions with defined roles and responsibilities, the club was structured to last indefinitely. In 2001 two additional members of Queen’s sailing team were recognized as All-Americans, Oskar Johansson (BA Economics and BSc Mech Eng ‘02) and Bernard Luttmer (BSc Eng ’02).

====More recent years====
In 2008, the Queen&#x27;s Journal newspaper wrote an article referring to Queen&#x27;s sailing as, &quot;... one of the Universities best-kept secrets&quot;. With multiple national titles in fleet racing, team racing, match racing and keelboat racing; as well as strong North American and international finishes that include a first in the 2016 Student Yachting World Cup Keelboat Championship, held in France as part of the student FISU Games, the club’s visibility has become much less of a secret over the years. Queen&#x27;s Sailing is also one of the few Canadian Universities in the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association (ICSA), specifically within the Middle Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association (MAISA) district of the United States; this allows Queen&#x27;s Sailing to compete against schools such as Georgetown, UPENN, Princeton, St. Mary&#x27;s and the US Naval Academy.

Today, Queen&#x27;s Sailing continues to operate as a student led sports team with the recognition of being a Varsity Club Team. It continues to maintain a governance model with defined positions identifying roles and responsibilities. Participation from the student body has increased significantly and both a Recreational group and Inter-Collegiate competitive group of sailors exist in any given year. Recruitment and on-the-water tryouts begin during Frosh Week. Despite, and possibly because of, these changes the success and reputation of Queen&#x27;s Sailing has continued to grow. Participation continues both nationally and internationally and the winning success the team has seen also continues. Participants in some cases are sons or daughters of past Queen&#x27;s sailors. This is due in part because the sailing legacy establish over the years at Queen&#x27;s University helps to attract not only academically qualified students, but also students who want to sail for Queen&#x27;s. Cha Geill!

==Mascot==
Boo Hoo the Bear is the mascot of Queen&#x27;s University. Boo Hoo wears a vest and tam o&#x27; shanter in the Royal Stewart tartan.

Originally, Boo Hoo was a real bear which was paraded around at football games and kept in the basement of Grant Hall. The first bear was a pet of Bill Hughes who brought him to Queen&#x27;s when he was hired as a boxing trainer. Music has been composed that was inspired by the Boo Hoo dynasty — &quot;Boo-Hoo&#x27;s march for piano&quot;, &quot;Boo Hoo&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Dominion Victory March&quot; (1922) and &quot;The Mascot: Boo Hoo&#x27;s March to Queen&#x27;s Rugby Team&quot; — by Oscar Telgmann in Toronto in the 1920s.

This was the first of a succession of five bears who lived at the stadium until the 1950s. The story of each bear is still unknown, though no bear reached full size. The Queen&#x27;s student government, the Alma Mater Society, was in charge of bears three and four.

The mascot was revived in its present form in the 1980s by the Queen&#x27;s Bands Cheerleaders and is currently in his eighth incarnation, giving him the full title of &quot;King Boo Hoo the Eighth&quot;. He is seen often around the Queen&#x27;s campus, at the Queen&#x27;s Gaels Canadian football games, frosh week and homecoming, and has been on the cover of several issues of &quot;Golden Words&quot;.

<text>Grosvenor Bridge, originally known as, and alternatively called Victoria Railway Bridge, is a railway bridge over the River Thames in London, between Vauxhall Bridge and Chelsea Bridge. Originally constructed in 1860, and widened in 1865 and 1907, the bridge was extensively rebuilt and widened again in the 1960s as an array of ten parallel bridges. There are now eight tracks across the bridge.

==History==
The original bridge was constructed in the mid-nineteenth century in two stages: the first bridge was built by the Victoria Station and Pimlico Railway between 1859 and 1860 at a cost of £84,000 to carry two tracks into Victoria Station; it was the first railway bridge across the Thames in central London. The engineer was Sir John Fowler.

The bridge was widened by four tracks on the eastern side for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and London, Chatham and Dover Railway between 1865 and 1866, at a cost of £245,000. Sir Charles Fox was the engineer.

In 1907 the bridge was widened again with a further track, on the western side, for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway.

In 1963–1967, the structure of the bridge was completely renewed and modernized, leaving only the cores of the original piers. At the same time, a tenth track was added in a space formerly used for gas mains. To minimize disruption to traffic, each track was renewed separately, and put back into service before the next one was closed. The designer for this work was Freeman Fox &amp; Partners, and the project engineer was A. H. Cantrell, chief civil engineer of the Southern Region of British Rail.
It was said to be the busiest railway bridge in the world with 1000 trains crossing per day in 1968.

==Location==
On the north bank is Pimlico to the north and east and Chelsea to the west; the Lister Hospital and the Royal Chelsea Hospital lie immediately to the north west. On the south bank is Nine Elms to the east and Battersea to the west. Battersea Power Station is immediately to the south of the bridge, and Battersea Park to the south west.

<text>City Thameslink is a central London railway station within the City of London, with entrances on Ludgate Hill and Holborn Viaduct. The station is on the Thameslink route between to the south and to the north.

The station opened in 1990 to replace Holborn Viaduct railway station. It was part of the Thameslink project that re-opened the Snow Hill Tunnel to provide a continuous north–south route across London. Originally named &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Thameslink&quot;, it was renamed &quot;City Thameslink&quot; the following year to avoid confusion with the nearby St Paul&#x27;s tube station on the Central line (note that out-of-station interchange discount does not apply for changing between these two stations). The station was refurbished in 2010–11 to increase capacity, and the timetable was revised in 2018 with the introduction of automatic signalling.

== Name and location ==

The station is near the western edge of the City of London, close to its border with the City of Westminster. It has two entrances, one on Ludgate Hill and another on Holborn Viaduct, both of which access the two platforms. It is one of the few main line stations in central London that does not have an interchange with the London Underground; it is roughly equidistant from Chancery Lane and on the Central line. A planned Tube station in the immediate area, to be named , was ultimately never built.

Although City Thameslink is a through station, for ticketing purposes it is classed as a London terminus for Thameslink services to and from the south; for services from the north it is a Thameslink Terminal station, which is a different fare. It is in Travelcard Zone 1 and one of the &quot;core stations&quot; on the Thameslink route, along with , and . The name has come in for criticism as being uninspiring.

London Buses routes 8, 15, 17, 25, 26, 40, 46, 59, 63, 76, 133, 341 and night routes N8, N15, N21, N25, N26, N63, N199, N242, N550 and N551 serve the station.

== History ==

=== Opening ===
The Thameslink line opened in 1988 after the Snow Hill tunnel, closed to passengers since 1916, was re-opened to provide a through route to Farringdon and King&#x27;s Cross from South London. Initially, trains used the approach viaduct for the now-closed station. The new service was an immediate financial success, and it was decided to redevelop the Holborn Viaduct site with a new station and business complex. The work was part-financed by the London property developer Rosehaugh Stanhope.

Before Holborn Viaduct station closed, a new line between and the tunnel was constructed on a different alignment slightly to the east and at a lower elevation, providing the opportunity to build of office space above the new station on a site. City Thameslink was built to replace Holborn Viaduct station and is partly on the site of the old station. The total cost was estimated at £360–£450 million. Because of a proposed routing for the second phase of the Jubilee line through the area, part of the station was built to allow for a future interchange.

Holborn Viaduct closed on 26 January 1990. The following May, all Thameslink services were suspended for 17 days so that demolition work could be carried out.

The station was opened by British Rail on 29 May 1990 as &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Thameslink&quot;, and was renamed as &quot;City Thameslink&quot; on 30 September 1991 to avoid confusion with the station on the London Underground Central line (which is several hundred yards to the east, to the north of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral). It was the first mainline station built in central London in almost 100 years. The station was designed by SAS International, who designed the original walls and panelling.

In conjunction with construction of the new station, the area around the old Holborn Viaduct and Ludgate Hill stations was redeveloped, and an old bridge across Ludgate Hill was removed. In 1992, following the demolition, an additional service tunnel was constructed connecting City Thameslink to Farringdon.

When the Thameslink franchise was awarded to First Capital Connect (FCC) in 2006, the Thameslink service was re-branded but City Thameslink was not renamed. By late 2010, FCC had reverted to the Thameslink name.

=== Recent events ===
As part of the Thameslink Programme, an upgrade of City Thameslink station was completed in 2010. The upgrade was important because the closure of Blackfriars later in the year would lead to increased footfall. The platforms were made ready for future 12-carriage trains, and the passenger information system improved. New lighting, ticket gates and CCTV cameras were installed, and the service announcement system was upgraded to provide more accurate train times. SAS retrofitted the station interior, as they had done for the original 1990 construction, with enamel wall panels that fitted the original design specification.

In a 2014 report, London TravelWatch suggested an underground passageway linking City Thameslink to St Paul&#x27;s tube station to provide an interchange with the Central line that would benefit passengers travelling from the Central line catchment to Gatwick and Luton Airports.

In 2018, Govia Thameslink Railway announced a major timetable change, which was implemented that May. The changes included a half-hour service across Central London, connecting City Thameslink with and . The signalling was upgraded to support automatic train operation through the station, along with the rest of the core Thameslink route, and British Rail Class 700 trains were introduced into the service. The following January, several evening services from City Thameslink to St Albans and were reinstated, after a six-month absence.

== Services ==
City Thameslink is served by trains operated by Thameslink on the Thameslink Route which run Monday-Saturday only, with the station being closed on Sundays. Train services are operated using Class 700 &quot;Desiro City&quot; EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via and Gatwick Airport
* 2 tph to Three Bridges via Redhill 
* 2 tph to via , , and 
* 4 tph to (two of these run via and two run via )
* 4 tph to (all stations)
* 2 tph to (all stations except , and )
* 4 tph to (semi-fast)
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via Stevenage 

City Thameslink serves as the lost property office of the Thameslink line. A fee is charged for retrieving property.

<text>Johann Peter Salomon (20 February 1745 [baptized] – 25 November 1815) was a German violinist, composer, conductor and musical impresario. Although an accomplished violinist, he is best known for bringing Joseph Haydn to London and for conducting the symphonies that Haydn wrote during his stay in England. He also knew and worked with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven.

==Life==
Johann Peter Salomon was born in January 1745 into a Jewish family in Bonn (but was baptized as an infant) and was the second son of Philipp Salomon, an oboist at the court in Bonn. His birth home was at Bonngasse 515, coincidentally the later birth home of Beethoven. In 1758, at the age of thirteen, he became a violinist in the orchestra of the Elector Clemens August at Bonn.

Seven years later, Salomon went on tour and traveled to Berlin and Frankfort. Following this he arrived in Rheinsberg where he soon became the concert master and composer for the orchestra of Prince Heinrich of Prussia. He composed several works for the court, including four operas and an oratorio. The orchestra of Prince Henrich was where Salomon premiered Joseph Haydn&#x27;s works. He moved to London in the early 1780s, where he worked as a composer and played violin as a soloist and in a string quartet. In 1786 he orchestrated a series of performances at the Hanover Square Rooms, of which he introduced Haydn&#x27;s and Mozart&#x27;s symphonies.

While in London, Salomon composed two operas for the Royal Opera, several art songs, a number of concertos, and chamber music pieces. He is perhaps best known today, however, as a concert organizer and conductor.

In 1790 Salomon traveled through Europe to recruit singers for the Italian opera. He was specifically drawn to Vienna since Prince Eszterhazy had recently died. He was focused on coercing Haydn to travel to England, which he did in 1791–92 and 1794–95. Together with Haydn, Salomon premiered many works that Haydn composed while in England. Haydn wrote his symphonies numbers 93 to 104 for these trips, sometimes known as the Salomon symphonies (more widely known as the London symphonies). Salomon is also said to have provided Haydn with the original model for the text of &quot;The Creation&quot;. He was one of the founder-members of the Philharmonic Society and led the orchestra at its first concert on 8 March 1813. 

Salomon is also believed to have given the &quot;Jupiter&quot; nickname to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 41&quot;.

Salomon died aged 70 at his house in Newman Street, Westminster, on 25 November 1815, after a long illness, following an incident in the summer of 1815 when he was thrown from his horse. He is buried in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey.

==Assessment==

Salomon&#x27;s violin playing was highly regarded in his day; for a collection of reviews, see Robbins Landon (1976, 24–27). H.C. Robbins Landon also praises his personal qualities: &quot;Salomon was not only a clever and sensitive impresario, he was also generous, scrupulously honest, and very efficient in business matters.&quot; Beethoven, who knew Salomon from his days in Bonn, wrote to Ries on hearing of his death, &quot;Salomon&#x27;s death grieves me much, for he was a noble man, and I remember him since I was a child.&quot;

Since 2011 the Royal Philharmonic Society has awarded the &quot;Salomon Prize&quot; to highlight talent and dedication within UK orchestras.
