<text>The Tandy 2000 is a personal computer introduced by Radio Shack in September 1983 based on the 8 MHz Intel 80186 microprocessor running MS-DOS. By comparison, the IBM PC XT (introduced in March 1983) used the older 4.77 MHz Intel 8088 processor, and the IBM PC/AT (introduced in 1984) would later use the newer 6 MHz Intel 80286. Due to the 16-bit data bus and more efficient instruction decoding of the 80186, the Tandy 2000 ran significantly faster than other PC compatibles, and slightly faster than the PC AT. (Later IBM upgraded the 80286 in new PC AT models to 8 MHz, though with wait states.) The Tandy 2000 was the company&#x27;s first computer built around an Intel x86 series microprocessor; previous models used the Zilog Z80 and Motorola 6809 CPUs.

While touted as being compatible with the IBM XT, the Tandy 2000 was different enough that most existing PC software that was not purely text-oriented failed to work properly.

The Tandy 2000 and its special version of MS-DOS supported up to 768 KB of RAM, significantly more than the 640 KB limit imposed by the IBM architecture. It used 80-track double-sided quad-density floppy drives of 720 KB capacity; the IBM standard at the time of the introduction of the Tandy 2000 was only 360 KB.

The Tandy 2000 had both &quot;Tandy&quot; and &quot;TRS-80&quot; logos on its case, marking the start of the phaseout of the &quot;TRS-80&quot; brand.

==History==

The introduction of IBM&#x27;s Model 5150 Personal Computer in August 1981 created an entirely new market for microcomputers. Many hardware and software companies were founded specifically to exploit IBM&#x27;s and Microsoft&#x27;s new presence as a standard-setter for small computers, and most other established manufacturers shifted focus to it as well.

By this date Tandy/Radio Shack had been in the small-computer market for four years, since its August 1977 introduction of the TRS-80 Model I. The new computer division followed in October 1979 with the TRS-80 Model II—a high-end business-oriented system. In 1983 the TRS-80 Model 4 succeeded the Model III (which itself had replaced the Model I) in the consumer and educational markets. In the business segment the TRS-80 Model 12 and Model 16 succeeded the Model II, adding higher-end features. Thus far Tandy/Radio Shack&#x27;s computer lines occupied their own niches in the market because of their proprietary system software and applications. Tandy attempted to monopolize software and peripheral sales by not offering third-party products in company stores. Until the IBM PC was introduced, the nearest thing to an industry standard in small computers was CP/M-80; no single manufacturer dominated.

By 1983 the IBM PC, and Tandy&#x27;s discouraging of third-party products, had halved the company&#x27;s market share and stopped profit growth. Tandy&#x27;s motive for moving into the new MS-DOS domain was twofold: to capitalize on the new market, and to leverage sales opportunities afforded by their solid position in small computers. Marketing management believed that many Tandy customers would prefer to stay with Tandy products when (inevitably, it seemed) they made the jump onto the burgeoning IBM/Microsoft bandwagon; it was figured that the company was well-positioned in this regard because of its large base of customers in both the consumer and business markets (with its Z80-based TRS-80 Models I/III/4 and 68000-based Models 12 and 16, respectively). Tandy&#x27;s large presence as a computer retailer, with several thousand Radio Shack stores throughout the US, was deemed an advantage as well. All other PC manufacturers, especially IBM, relied mainly on sales to corporate accounts, not consumer retail as did Tandy/Radio Shack. Thus the company would become the market leader offering the hottest new trend—affordable 16-bit computers running MS-DOS—directly to the computing public.

Therefore, Tandy would have to produce an IBM-style computer running the emerging industry-standard MS-DOS. The company decided to distinguish it from similar products by producing a better computer. The new machine would be aimed at the mid-price market between high-end consumers and low-end businesses. This was deemed prudent in order not to seriously cannibalize their current product lines serving both market segments. Most other big-name computer manufacturers made the same leap into the PC/MS-DOS market:

Shortly after IBM&#x27;s introduction of its 286-based PC/AT, one reviewer remarked, &quot;The bottom line is that the Tandy 2000 is still one of the hottest single-user machines on the market, and a full year after its introduction, its superiority remains unchallenged.&quot;

Applications software compatible with the MS-DOS operating system would run properly on the Tandy 2000. This means that the software had to access the computer&#x27;s hardware (particularly the video display) strictly through calls to the operating system&#x27;s BIOS. However, programs written to run under the similar PC DOS operating system on an actual IBM PC computer often bypassed calls to the operating system because the IBM BIOS was poorly designed and implemented. To function with adequate speed of execution, and to perform operations not provided for by the IBM BIOS, applications programmers often coded their programs to directly address the hardware of the IBM PC. Therefore any computer such as the Tandy 2000 that had hardware that differed in its details from an IBM PC would not execute programs the same way, which most often manifested incorrect results by those programs.

Tandy engineers tested one hundred of the most popular PC programs and half were found to be incompatible with the 2000&#x27;s hardware. Tandy&#x27;s marketing department failed to appreciate that similar non-compatible computers from DEC, TI and Eagle were not successful. Its strategy of offering a high-performance PC was the origin of the Tandy 2000&#x27;s technical specifications. Some of the rival computers improved the PC hardware and matched the Tandy 2000 in one or two dimensions, but none offered across-the-board enhancement. Except as noted, they ran MS-DOS but were incompatible with the IBM PC at the hardware level. The copycat computers competed primarily on lower pricing and, like Tandy, exploiting their installed customer bases.

Tandy described the 2000 as having a &quot;&#x27;next generation&#x27; true 16-bit CPU&quot;, and with &quot;More speed. More disk storage. More expansion&quot; than the IBM PC or &quot;other MS-DOS computers&quot;. While admitting in 1984 that many MS-DOS programs did not support the computer, the company stated that &quot;the most popular, sophisticated software on the market&quot; was available, either immediately or &quot;over the next six months&quot;.

Two models of Tandy 2000 were introduced: a dual-drive floppy-only model for and the 2000HD with a single floppy drive and a half-height 10 MB hard drive for . The dual-floppy model had 128 KB RAM and the hard-drive-equipped 2000HD had 256 KB. For comparison, at this time the low-end TRS-80 Model 4 with two floppy drives cost and the high-end Model 16 with two floppy drives cost .

Tandy executive Ed Juge said that within six months Tandy realized that it had erred with the 2000. By early 1985 &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported that Tandy introduced the Tandy 1000 because it &quot;found that the market prefers true PC compatibility&quot; to the 2000&#x27;s incomplete compatibility. The Tandy 2000 received a lukewarm welcome by the market and the computer press because of its inability to run most popular MS-DOS applications. This was not anticipated by Tandy because, at the time, it was accepted practice for new software to be created for each new computer that came to market. This is also why so many of the other PC-style computers by other manufacturers were not hardware-compatible with the IBM PC. Though the company supported the machine with hardware add-ons and software tailored specially for it (including bestsellers like Lotus 1-2-3 Release 1A and AutoCAD), the computer failed to gain popular acceptance and was never developed further. It would not be until late 1986, with the introduction of the Tandy 3000, that Tandy offered a PC-style computer with performance comparable with the Tandy 2000.

The Tandy 2000 was marketed through early 1988 with continual price cuts. Eventually they were closed out for $999 and the remaining unsold computers were converted into Radio Shack store operations terminals (which, coincidentally, had been one of the backup plans for the original TRS-80 Model I).

== Compatibility issues ==
The Tandy 2000 was nominally BIOS-compatible with the IBM XT, so well-behaved DOS software ran on both platforms. However, most DOS software of the time bypassed the operating system and BIOS and directly accessed the hardware (especially video and external ports) to achieve higher performance. This rendered such software incompatible with the Tandy 2000.

=== Graphics ===
The base-model Tandy 2000 supported only a text-mode display in monochrome. The Tandy VM-1 monitor used the 8-pin DIN video port on the computer&#x27;s rear panel. The text-mode address space was in a different location but third-party memory-resident software hacks remedied this by copying the PC-compatible text-mode memory to the Tandy 2000&#x27;s text space at a rate of 5–10 times per second. This sometimes caused some choppiness in the display. It produced a fast text display rate—often too fast to read—but the &#x27;HOLD&#x27; key on the keyboard could be used to pause text output.

The bit pattern for each text character&#x27;s raster image was maintained in RAM and could be modified by the user. With clever programming the display&#x27;s ability to present fine lines provided by the 640x400 screen resolution could be accessed in text mode even without the optional graphics board.

==== Tandy 2000 Graphics Adapter ====

The display was upgradable to support pixel-addressable graphics via the Tandy 2000 Graphics Adapter, a circuit board that fit into an expansion slot. It had its own connector for the monochrome VM-1 monitor; the video connector in the rear-panel cabinet was disabled when this expansion board was installed. The graphics resolution was 640x400 and supported high intensity pixels.

Color capability was provided by the Color Graphics Option, which was a set of chips that were inserted into the empty sockets on the monochrome Graphics Adapter provided for this purpose. Resolution for the color board was the same 640x400, non-interlaced, and eight colors out of a palette of sixteen available colors were displayable on the Tandy CM-1 monitor (~$799). This was a particularly high-resolution and colorful display for its day. The CM-1 monitor accepted, as input from the color graphics board, digital RGBI signals (indicating separate Red, Green, and Blue signals with a Intensity bit). CGA compatibility was hit-or-miss.

There were only three non-Tandy monitors that worked with the Tandy 2000 graphics card, all of which are long out of production. These were the original (1986–88) Mitsubishi Diamond Scan, and the NEC Multisync and Multisync GS (grayscale). The required horizontal scan frequency for the Tandy 2000 is 26.4 kHz. Modern flat-panel multisync computer monitors cannot sync at frequencies below 30 kHz. The CM-1 monitor is also digital RGB; all modern CRT monitors are analog-only.

=== Media ===
The Tandy 2000 used quad-density 5.25&quot; floppy disks formatted at 720k. This format (80-track disks at the double-density bitrate) was not used by PC-compatibles, although some CP/M machines and the Commodore 8050/8250 drives had them. Normal PCs of the time had 40-track double-density floppy drives and could not read quad-density due to the drive heads being too wide to read the narrower tracks. 1.2 MB 5.25&quot; drives (introduced on the IBM AT) could read quad-density disks because they were 80-track and had thinner heads. Various utility programs for DOS existed that could read nonstandard formats such as the Tandy 2000&#x27;s disks. Much like 1.2 MB drives, the Tandy 2000 had problems reliably writing 360k PC disks due to the smaller heads not completely erasing the tracks and causing 40-track drives to become confused by residual magnetic signals on the outer edge of the track. Tandy distributed the computer with a utility called PC-Maker that would read and format 40-track disks in the 2000s 80-track drives, and were readable in drives on ordinary PCs.

The floppy controller on the Tandy 2000 is compatible with 3.5&quot; double-density 720 KB floppy drives.

As of May 2019, there is an abandonware site (winworldpc.com) that has available for download a disk image for the latest version of MS-DOS for the Tandy 2000. It includes instructions for using the IBM 1.2 MB 5.25&quot; disk drive (80-track) to create a system disk bootable in the Tandy 2000 5.25&quot; drive. This procedure can also be used to create a bootable 3.5-inch system disk using an ordinary 720 KB 3.5-inch PC drive; this will boot a Tandy 2000 if its 5.25&quot; boot drive has been replaced with a double-density 720 KB 3.5 inch PC drive.

=== Keyboard ===
The keyboard was a new design made for the Tandy 2000. It would later be the same keyboard shipped with the Tandy 1000 and its successors.

The arrangement of the function keys was changed from that of the IBM PC/XT, which had ten on the left side of the keyboard in two columns of five. Tandy was among the first PC manufacturers to change this to the modern arrangement of twelve function keys arranged horizontally across the top. IBM gave a nod to the new standard by using this arrangement for the Model M keyboard.

=== Serial port ===
The serial port hardware was completely different from the PC/XT&#x27;s. PC-compatible terminal emulation software had to either access the serial hardware strictly through BIOS or use a FOSSIL driver, a software wrapper that virtualized the serial hardware (see also DEC Rainbow), to run on a wider variety of hardware.

Several terminal programs were available for the Tandy 2000, making it possible to log in on BBSes, e-mail, and other remote systems.

=== Operating system ===
The Tandy 2000 required a specific version of MS-DOS that would run only on this machine. Standard MS-DOS or PC DOS (for generic IBM-compatibles) would not run on a Tandy 2000. It was standard practice and Microsoft&#x27;s expectation at the time that a customized version of MS-DOS would be prepared for each different machine, with I/O drivers designed for the hardware of that model. The highest version of DOS that Tandy Corporation released for the Tandy 2000 was 2.11.03, with a few minor third-party patches after the fact. A modified version of Windows 1.0 was able to run on the Tandy 2000.

MS-DOS for the Tandy 2000 resided entirely in RAM, unlike on IBM PCs where the BIOS portion of the OS resided in ROM. The complete MS-DOS system (BIOS and BDOS) occupied about 53 KB of RAM. This means that the RAM required to run applications on the Tandy 2000 was a little greater. However, the Tandy 2000 fared better in comparison to the later IBM PC-AT in that the AT was required to run MS-DOS version 3.x in order to operate its 1.2 MB floppy drives and hard drive. Version 3 of MS-DOS was rather larger than Version 2.x running on the Tandy 2000. It also proved advantageous that the Tandy 2000&#x27;s OS resided entirely in RAM and therefore could be updated and hacked with rather less effort.

The Microsoft BASIC interpreter was supplied with the computer. It was highly customized for the Tandy 2000 hardware, particularly its high-resolution color graphics. Although IBM produced the Enhanced Graphics Adapter a little more than a year later (October 1984), the Microsoft BASIC interpreter would not support its greater color and resolution capabilities until 1988.

Tandy/Radio Shack produced print advertising featuring Bill Gates of Microsoft extolling the superior performance of the Tandy 2000 and how it was advantageous in Microsoft&#x27;s development of Windows 1.0.

== Software ==
Software packages that were released for the Tandy 2000 included WordPerfect 4.2 (WP5.1 could work with software patches), Lotus 1-2-3, Ashton-Tate&#x27;s Framework, DBase, MultiMate, , AutoCAD, Lumena (from Time Arts) shareware office programs, and the complete line of Microsoft language products. Microsoft released a version of Xenix for the Tandy 2000 (used with Western Digital&#x27;s ViaNet network card, distributed by Tandy).

Better BASIC for both the Tandy 2000 and the PC was used to write BBS software for the Tandy 2000 and later ported to the IBM PC.
Radio Shack&#x27;s DeskMate was also used with the Tandy 2000 and the Tandy 1000.

MicroPro&#x27;s Wordstar (versions 3.3 and 4.0 only) would run on the Tandy 2000 provided the user ran the WINSTALL installation utility and, when prompted for the type of video display to be used, selected &quot;ROM BIOS&quot;. While this would result in a functional installation, none of the T2000&#x27;s special features would be operative (except for increased speed and storage).

The only version of Lotus 1-2-3 offered for the Tandy 2000 was Release 1A. This was customized to take advantage of the unique hardware of the computer, including its full 768K of RAM, high resolution color graphics, and two extra function keys.

Release 1A&#x27;s executable code was about 60 KB smaller than the later Release 2, which provided greater macro programming facilities. This extra space for data, with the additional 128 KB of RAM available to a fully expanded Tandy 2000, made it possible to construct larger worksheets than later PCs running Release 2 (until the advent of machines with Expanded memory). For nearly two years following its introduction, the Tandy 2000 was the top performer for processing large models in Lotus 1-2-3.

The Tandy 2000&#x27;s 720 KB floppy drives were a distinct advantage for running Lotus, because they were large enough to store even the largest worksheets on a single diskette. This is in stark contrast to the IBM PC and XT with 360 KB floppy disks. In order to store the largest worksheets, a PC user would have to split them and save them on two disks—and then recombine them in memory later. Although the XT had a hard drive that could store large Lotus worksheets in a single file, a user could not rely on a single storage device for permanent storage of important data files; again they would be forced to segment worksheets for storage on separate disks. The Tandy 2000&#x27;s large-capacity floppy disks made backup maintenance relatively effortless.

== End of life ==
After Tandy dropped support of the Tandy 2000, a group of users formed the Tandy 2000 Orphans, with software reviews, software and hardware hacks, and a shareware/freeware repository. It was discovered by amateur programmers that many commercial MS-DOS applications needed only minor modifications to function on the Tandy 2000&#x27;s unique hardware.

There was also a BBS based in Texas that had an extensive library of compatible software available for download; neither the BBS nor its web-based descendant is active today.

<doc id="390319" wikidata="Q1570062" url="?curid=390319" title="Fuel pump">
<text>A Fuel pump is a component used in many liquid-fuelled engines (such as petrol/gasoline or diesel engines) to transfer the fuel from the fuel tank to the device where it is mixed with the intake air (such as the carburetor or fuel injector).

Carbureted engines often use low-pressure mechanical pumps that are mounted on the engine. Fuel injected engines use either electric fuel pumps mounted inside the fuel tank (for lower pressure manifold injection systems) or high-pressure mechanical pumps mounted on the engine (for high-pressure direct injection systems).

Some engines do not use any fuel pump at all. A low-pressure fuel supply used by a carbureted engine can be achieved through a gravity feed system, i.e. by simply mounting the tank higher than the carburetor. This method is commonly used in carbureted motorcycles, where the tank is usually directly above the engine.

== Low-pressure mechanical pumps==
On engines that use a carburetor (e.g. in older cars, lawnmowers and power tools), a mechanical fuel pump is typically used in order to transfer fuel from the fuel tank into the carburetor. These fuel pumps operate at a relatively low fuel pressure of .

The two most widely used types of mechanical pumps are diaphragm pumps and plunger pumps.

== High-pressure mechanical pumps ==
Pumps for modern direct-injection engines operate at a much higher pressure, up to and have configurations such as common rail radial piston, common rail two piston radial, inline, port and helix, and metering unit. Injection pumps are fuel lubricated which prevents oil from contaminating the fuel.

=== Port and Helix pumps ===
Port and Helix pumps are most commonly used in marine diesel engines because of their simplicity, reliability, and its ability to be scaled up in proportion to the engine size. The pump is similar to that of a radial piston-type pump, but instead of a piston it has a machined plunger that has no seals. When the plunger is at top dead center, the injection to the cylinder is finished and it is returned on its downward stroke by a compression spring.

Due to the fixed height of a cam lobe, the amount of fuel being pumped to the injector is controlled by a rack and pinion device that rotates the plunger, thus allowing variable amounts of fuel to the area above the plunger. The fuel is then forced through a check valve and into the fuel injector nozzle.

=== Plunger-type pumps ===
Plunger-type pumps are a type of positive-displacement pump used by diesel engines. These pumps contain a chamber whose volume is increased and/or decreased by a moving plunger, along with check valves at the inlet and discharge ports. It is similar to that of a piston pump, but the high-pressure seal is stationary while the smooth cylindrical plunger slides through the seal.

Plunger-type pumps are often mounted on the side of the injection pump and driven by the camshaft. These pumps usually run at a fuel pressure of .

== Electric pumps ==
In fuel-injected petrol engines, an electric fuel pump is typically located inside the fuel tank. For older port injection and throttle-body injection systems, this &quot;in-tank&quot; fuel pump transports the fuel from the fuel tank to the engine, as well as pressurising the fuel to typically . While for direct-injection systems, the in-tank fuel pump transports the fuel to the engine, where a separate fuel pump pressurises the fuel (to a much higher pressure).

Since the electric pump does not require mechanical power from the engine, it is feasible to locate the pump anywhere between the engine and the fuel tank. The reasons that the fuel pump is typically located in the fuel tank are:
* By submerging the pump in fuel at the bottom of the tank, the pump is cooled by the surrounding fuel
* Liquid fuel by itself (i.e. without oxygen present) isn&#x27;t flammable, therefore surrounding the fuel pump by fuel reduces the risk of fire

In-tank fuel pumps are often part of an assembly consisting of the fuel pump, fuel strainer and fuel level sensor (the latter used for the fuel gauge).

==Turbopumps==
Rocket engines use a turbopump to supply the fuel and oxidizer into the combustion chamber.

<doc id="390321" wikidata="Q6550125" url="?curid=390321" title="Lin Yang-kang">
<text>Lin Yang-kang ( ; 10 June 1927 – 13 April 2013) was a Taiwanese politician. He was born at Sun Moon Lake during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. Some thought he might be Chiang Ching-kuo&#x27;s successor as head of the Kuomintang (KMT), but after failing to win the KMT&#x27;s nomination for president in 1996, he became an independent. Lin rejoined the party in 2005, and died in 2013.

==Personal life==
Lin was born in Niitaka District, Taichū Prefecture (modern-day Nantou County), Taiwan, and graduated from National Taiwan University with a Bachelor of Science degree.

Lin was married to Chen Ho (陳閤) and had one son and three daughters. On 13 April 2013, Lin died at home in Taichung, of intestinal obstruction and organ failure, aged 85.

==Political career==
Lin began his political career in the 1960s. By 1990, he was a vice-chairman of the Kuomintang. Aligned with the &quot;non-mainstream faction&quot; that aimed to be less confrontational with the People&#x27;s Republic of China than Lee Teng-hui, Lin tried to replace Lee in the 1990 presidential election, with Chiang Wei-kuo as his running mate.
He resigned his position as the head of the Judicial Yuan on 1 September 1994 to become a presidential advisor to Lee Teng-hui. Upon taking the appointment, Lin again declared his candidacy for Taiwan&#x27;s first direct presidential elections, scheduled for 1996. However, he was not chosen as the Kuomintang nominee. Lin and Chen Li-an resisted calls to join forces and run as the New Party ticket, choosing instead to run separately as independents. After considering Chang Feng-hsu as a running mate, Lin eventually chose former premier Hau Pei-tsun, believing that Hau&#x27;s background might attract more mainlanders&#x27; votes for him. However, Lin&#x27;s pro-China and pro-reunification views during the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis caused many Taishang to vote against him, and the Lin–Hau ticket finished third with 14.9% of the vote. Chen ran with Wang Ching-feng. Both Chen and Lin were later expelled from the Kuomintang. He retired from political affairs and secluded himself in Taichung after this defeat. Lin resumed membership in the KMT in 2005.

<doc id="390323" wikidata="Q1361626" url="?curid=390323" title="USS Bunker Hill (CV-17)">
<text>USS &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-17, AVT-9) was one of 24 s built during World War II for the United States Navy. The ship was named for the Battle of Bunker Hill in the American Revolutionary War. Commissioned in May 1943 and sent to the Pacific Theater of Operations, the ship participated in battles in the Southwest Pacific, Central Pacific and the drive toward Japan through Iwo Jima and Okinawa, and air raids on the Japanese homeland.

While covering the invasion of Okinawa, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was struck by two kamikazes in quick succession on 11 May 1945, setting the vessel on fire. Casualties exceeded 600, including 396 killed or missing, with 264 wounded. These were the second heaviest personnel losses suffered by any carrier to survive the war, after . After the attack, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; returned to the U.S. mainland and was under repair when hostilities ended.

After the war, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was employed as a troop transport bringing American service members back from the Pacific, and was decommissioned in 1947. While in reserve the vessel was reclassified as an attack carrier (CVA), then an antisubmarine carrier (CVS) and finally an Auxiliary Aircraft Landing Training Ship (AVT), but was never modernized and never saw active service again. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot; were the only &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships never recommissioned after World War II.

Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 1966, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; served as an electronics test platform for many years in San Diego Bay. An effort to save her as a museum ship in 1972 was unsuccessful and she was sold for scrap in 1973.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was laid down on 15 September 1941, as hull number 1509 at the Bethlehem Steel Company&#x27;s Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts, and launched on 7 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Donald Boynton. The carrier was commissioned on 25 May 1943, with Captain J. J. Ballentine in command. The carrier took aboard her air group at Norfolk, Virginia, at the end of June, and on 15 July sailed south to Trinidad on her shakedown cruise. Three weeks later the ship returned to Norfolk, and on 4 September sailed south to the Panama Canal on the way to San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and the Pacific Theater of Operations.

==Service history during World War II==
===1943–1944===
&quot;Bunker Hill&quot; had worked up with VF-17, a new fighter squadron flying F4U Corsairs. The Corsair, a new airplane, had some difficulties in its development, and the Navy gave consideration to replacing VF-17&#x27;s Corsairs with Grumman F6F Hellcats. The squadron successfully argued for retention of its Corsairs, as they felt they were better combat aircraft. Hence, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; had departed for the combat theater with VF-17 and its Corsairs aboard. While en route from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, the pilots found that the Navy had decided not to use Corsairs aboard carriers, to avoid carrying parts and supplies for two fighters (the Corsair and the Hellcat) and with the challenges the U.S. Navy was having in getting Corsairs approved for carrier use at that time. (The British Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm developed an appropriate landing technique for its shipboard Corsairs by very early 1944, using a curving approach that kept the LSO (landing signal officer) in view while coming aboard, and this was adopted by the U.S. Navy by late 1944.) VF-17 was ordered to the Southwest Pacific, where it was land-based. It was replaced aboard &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; by VF-18, whose men and Hellcats had also been ferried aboard the carrier from San Diego to Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Bunker Hill&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 19 October en route to the Southwest Pacific. The carrier&#x27;s air group participated in the air raid on the major Imperial Japanese Navy base at Rabaul, along with and on 11 November 1943. During the mission the carriers&#x27; fighters (VF-18) escorted bombers to Rabaul, and CV-17 was reunited with VF-17, then land-based at Ondonga Airfield in the Solomon Islands. The tailhooks were reinstalled on the squadron&#x27;s Corsairs, enabling them to land and refuel on their former ship while providing air cover to the task force as its own planes were escorting the raid on Rabaul. On 14 November the carrier set a course for the Gilbert Islands to cover the invasion and occupation of Tarawa.

&quot;Bunker Hill&quot; went on to air raids on Kavieng in support of the amphibious landings in the Bismarck Archipelago (25 December 1943, 1 January, and 4 January 1944); air raids in the Marshall Islands (29 January – 8 February); the large-scale carrier air raids on Truk Atoll (17–18 February), during which eight Japanese warships were sunk; and air raids on the Marianas Islands (Guam, Saipan, and Tinian) (23 February). &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; returned to Hawaii (28 February – 4 March 1944), and completed voyage repairs and upkeep while in dry dock at Pearl Harbor Navy Yard (6–9 March). At this time, CAG-17 detached from the carrier, which subsequently took on the newly formed CVG-8, along with four night fighting Hellcats of VF(N)-76. During 15–20 March, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; steamed for Majuro, Marshall Islands. At this point, CVG-8 reported 41 F6F-3s of VF-8, 32 SB2C-1Cs of VB-8, 22 TBF-1Cs of VT-8, and a flag F6F-3 on board, along with the four F6F-3Ns.

Subsequent combat operations included air raids on Palau, Yap, Ulithi, and Woleai in the Palau Islands (30 March – 1 April); raids in support of the U.S. Army landings around Hollandia (21–28 April); air raids on Truk, Satawan, and Ponape in the Caroline Islands (29 April – 1 May), and combat operations in the Marianas in support of the amphibious landings on Saipan and Guam (12 June – 10 August), including the titanic Battle of the Philippine Sea, just west of the Marianas. On 19 June 1944, during the opening phases of the landings in the Marianas, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was damaged when the explosion of a Japanese aerial bomb scattered shrapnel fragments across the decks and the sides of the aircraft carrier. Two sailors were killed, and about 80 more were wounded. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; continued to fight, with her antiaircraft fire shooting down a few IJN warplanes. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea, about 476 Japanese warplanes were destroyed, nearly all of them shot down by Navy F6F Hellcats, such as those carried by &quot;Bunker Hill.&quot; During September, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; carried out air raids in the western Caroline Islands, and then she and her task force steamed north to launch air raids on Luzon, Formosa, and Okinawa, through early November.

On 6 November 1944, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; steamed eastward from the forward area, and went to the Bremerton Naval Shipyard, for major overhaul/upkeep work and weaponry upgrades. The carrier departed from the Port of Bremerton on 24 January 1945 and returned to the combat area in the Western Pacific. Stopping at Pearl Harbor on the way, the carrier took aboard Carrier Air Group 84, which included VF-84, a new squadron built around a nucleus of veterans of VF-17, the carrier&#x27;s original squadron.

===1945===
In 1945, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was the flagship of Task Force 58, commanded by Vice-Admiral Marc A. Mitscher. Commodore Arleigh Burke was his chief of staff, and the admiral&#x27;s staff all were accommodated aboard the carrier. In the task force&#x27;s final drive across the central Pacific, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; operated with the other fast carriers and their screening gunships in the Battle of Iwo Jima, the 5th Fleet raids against Honshū and the Nansei Shoto (15 February – 4 March), and the 5th Fleet&#x27;s support of the Battle of Okinawa. On 7 April 1945, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;″s planes took part in an attack by the Fast Carrier Task Force of the Pacific Fleet on Imperial Japanese Navy forces in the East China Sea. The carrier&#x27;s aircraft had located the Japanese battleship &quot;Yamato&quot;, the largest battleship in the world. In Operation Ten-Go the battleship, screened by one light cruiser and eight destroyers, steamed toward Okinawa to interfere with the Allied invasion of that island. The aircraft of the task force attacked and sank &quot;Yamato&quot;, the cruiser, and four of the destroyers.

On the morning of 11 May 1945, while supporting the invasion of Okinawa, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was struck and severely damaged by two Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes. A Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter plane piloted by Lieutenant Junior Grade Seizō Yasunori emerged from low cloud cover, dove toward the flight deck on the starboard quarter and dropped a 550-pound (250 kilogram) bomb that penetrated the flight deck and exited from the side of the ship at gallery deck level before exploding in the ocean. The Zero then crashed onto the carrier&#x27;s flight deck, destroying parked warplanes full of aviation fuel and ammunition, causing a large fire. The remains of the Zero went over the deck and dropped into the sea. Then 30 seconds later, a second Zero, piloted by Ensign Kiyoshi Ogawa, plunged into its suicide dive. The Zero went through the antiaircraft fire, dropped a 550-pound bomb, and then crashed into the flight deck near the carrier&#x27;s &quot;island&quot;, as &quot;kamikazes&quot; were trained to aim for the island superstructure. The bomb carried by the second kamikaze penetrated to the pilots&#x27; ready room, where 22 members of VF-84 lost their lives. Gasoline fires flamed up and several explosions took place.

&quot;Bunker Hill&quot; lost 396 sailors and airmen killed, including 43 missing and never found, and 264 wounded. Among the casualties were three officers and eleven enlisted men from Mitscher&#x27;s staff. The admiral relinquished command by visual signal; he and his remaining staff were transferred by breeches buoy to destroyer &quot;English&quot; and then to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which became the flagship. &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was heavily damaged but was able to steam at 20 knots to Ulithi, where the Marine pilots of VMF-221, who had been aloft during the kamikaze attack and were diverted to other carriers, rejoined their ship. The carrier returned home by way of Pearl Harbor, and was sent to the Bremerton Naval Shipyard for repairs. She was still in the shipyard when the war ended in mid-August 1945.

==Post-war==
On 27 September 1945, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; sailed from Bremerton to report for duty with the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, returning veterans from the Pacific as a unit of TG 16.12. The vessel made return trips to the west coast from Pearl Harbor, the Philippines, and Guam and Saipan. The ship was opened for visitors on Navy Day 27 October 1945 while in port at Seattle, WA. In January 1946 the ship was ordered to Bremerton for deactivation, and was decommissioned into reserve on 9 January 1947.
While in reserve &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was reclassified three times, becoming CVA-17 in October 1951, CVS-17 in August 1953, and AVT-9 in May 1959, with the latter designation indicating that any future commissioned operations would be as an &quot;Auxiliary Aircraft Transport Carrier&quot;. As all &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers survived the war, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was surplus to the needs of the navy. She and , which also had sustained severe damage from an aerial attack, were the only aircraft carriers in the &quot;Essex&quot;-class that did not have any active service after the end of World War II. Although their wartime damage had been successfully repaired, it was their resultant like-new condition which kept them out of commission, as the Navy for many years envisioned an &quot;ultimate reconfiguration&quot; for &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; and &quot;Franklin&quot; which never took place.

Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in November 1966, &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; was used as a stationary electronics test platform at the Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, during the 1960s and early 1970s. On 2 July 1973 the vessel was sold for scrap to Zidell Explorations, Inc. of Oregon. An effort to save her as a museum ship in 1972 was unsuccessful.

Some relics survive. Six hundred tons of steel armor plate, manufactured before the atomic age, are used by Fermilab as low-background steel to shield experiments from interference by ambient or background subatomic particles. Dome-shaped protective shrouds from the carrier&#x27;s mothballing were incorporated in a residence in West Linn, Oregon. The ship&#x27;s bell was purchased from the scrapper, displayed for a while at the San Diego Air and Space Museum, and in 1986 was provided to the guided missile cruiser which bears the name USS &quot;Bunker Hill&quot;.

==Awards==
&quot;Bunker Hill&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation for the 18 months between 11 November 1943 and 11 May 1945, from the first combat in the Solomon Islands to the day the ship was knocked out of the war by kamikazes. In addition, she received 11 battle stars for service in the following battles:
* Presidential Unit Citation 
*American Campaign Medal 
*Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (11 stars)
*World War II Victory Medal 
*Philippine Presidential Unit Citation 
*Philippine Liberation Medal

<text>This is a list of the origins of computer-related terms or terms used in the computing world (i.e., a list of computer term [[etymology|etymologies]]). It relates to both computer hardware and computer software.

Names of many computer terms, especially computer applications, often relate to the function they perform, e.g., a compiler is an application that &quot;compiles&quot; (programming language source code into the computer&#x27;s machine language). However, there are other terms with less obvious origins, which are of etymological interest. This article lists such terms.
==A==

* ABEND – originally from an IBM System/360 error message, short for &quot;abnormal end&quot;. Jokingly reinterpreted as German &quot;Abend&quot; (&quot;evening&quot;), because &quot;it is what system operators do to the machine late on Friday when they want to call it a day.&quot;

* Ada – named after Ada Lovelace, who is considered by many to be the first programmer.
* Apache – originally chosen from respect for the Native American Indian tribe of Apache. It was suggested that the name was appropriate, as Apache began as a series of patches to code written for NCSA&#x27;s HTTPd daemon. The result was &quot;a patchy&quot; server.

* AWK – composed of the initials of its authors Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan.

==B==

* B – probably a contraction of &quot;BCPL&quot;, reflecting Ken Thompson&#x27;s efforts to implement a smaller BCPL in 8 KB of memory on a DEC PDP-7. Or, named after Bon.

* biff – named after a dog known by the developers at Berkeley, who – according to the UNIX manual page – died on 15 August 1993, at the age of 15, and belonged to Heidi Stettner. Some sources report that the dog would bark at the mail carrier, making it a natural choice for the name of a mail notification system. The Jargon File contradicts this description, but confirms at least that the dog existed.

* bit – first used by Claude E. Shannon in his seminal 1948 paper &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;. Shannon&#x27;s &quot;bit&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;binary digit&quot;. He attributed its origin to John W. Tukey, who had used the word in a Bell Labs memo of 9 January 1947.

* Bon – created by Ken Thompson and named either after his wife Bonnie, or else after &quot;a religion whose rituals involve the murmuring of magic formulas&quot; (a reference to the Tibetan native religion Bön).
* booting or bootstrapping – from the phrase &quot;to pull oneself up by one&#x27;s bootstraps&quot;, originally used as a metaphor for any self-initiating or self-sustaining process. Used in computing due to the apparent paradox that a computer must run code to load anything into memory, but code cannot be run until it is loaded.
* bug – often (but erroneously) credited to Grace Hopper. In 1946, she joined the Harvard Faculty at the Computation Laboratory where she traced an error in the Harvard Mark II to a moth trapped in a relay. This bug was carefully removed and taped to the log book. However, use of the word &#x27;bug&#x27; to describe defects in mechanical systems dates back to at least the 1870s, perhaps especially in Scotland. Thomas Edison, for one, used the term in his notebooks and letters.
* byte – coined by Werner Buchholz in June 1956 during the early design phase for the IBM Stretch computer.

==C==

* C – a programming language.
:Dennis Ritchie, having improved on the B language, named his creation &quot;New B&quot;. He later renamed it &quot;C&quot;. (See also D).

* C++ – an object-oriented programming language, a successor to the C programming language.
:C++ creator Bjarne Stroustrup named his new language &quot;C with Classes&quot; and then &quot;new C&quot;. The original language began to be called &quot;old C&quot; which was considered insulting to the C community. At this time Rick Mascitti suggested the name C++ as a successor to C. In C the &#x27;++&#x27; operator increments the value of the variable it is appended to, thus &quot;C++&quot; would increment the value of &quot;C&quot;.

* computer – from the human computers who carried out calculations mentally and possibly with mechanical aids, now replaced by electronic programmable computers.
* cookie – a packet of information that travels between a browser and the web server.
: The term was coined by web browser programmer Lou Montulli after the term &quot;magic cookies&quot; used by Unix programmers. The term &quot;magic cookie&quot; in turn derives from &quot;fortune cookie&quot;, a cookie with an embedded message.

* Cursor (user interface) - Cursor is Latin for &#x27;runner.&#x27; A cursor is the name given to the transparent slide engraved with a hairline that is used for marking a point on a slide rule. The term was then transferred to computers through analogy.

==D==

* D – a programming language.
:Designed by Walter Bright as an improved C, avoiding many of the design problems of C (&quot;e.g.&quot;, extensive pointer manipulation, unenforced array boundaries, &quot;etc.&quot;).

* daemon – a process in an operating system that runs in the background.
: It is not an acronym for Disk And Execution Monitor: according to the original team that introduced the concept, the use of the word daemon was inspired by the Maxwell&#x27;s demon of physics and thermodynamics (an imaginary agent which helped sort molecules with differing velocities and worked tirelessly in the background) The term was embraced, and possibly popularized, by the Unix operating systems which supported multiple background processes: various local (and later Internet) services were provided by daemons. This is exemplified by the BSD mascot, John Lasseter&#x27;s drawing of a friendly imp.

* Dashboard - Originally, the word dashboard applied to a barrier of wood or leather fixed at the front of a horse-drawn carriage or sleigh to protect the driver from mud or other debris &quot;dashed up&quot; (thrown up) by the horses&#x27; hooves.[1] The first known use of the term (hyphenated as dash-board, and applied to sleighs) dates from 1847.[2] Commonly these boards did not perform any additional function other than providing a convenient handhold for ascending into the driver&#x27;s seat, or a small clip with which to secure the reins when not in use.
* Debian – a Linux distribution.
:A portmanteau of the names Ian Murdock, the Debian Project creator, and Debra Lynn, Ian&#x27;s then girlfriend and future wife.

* default – an initial value for a variable or user setting.
:The original meaning of the word &#x27;default&#x27; is &#x27;failure to fulfill an obligation&#x27;. The obligation here is to provide an input that is required by a program. In the early days of programming, if an input value was missing, or &#x27;null&#x27;, the program would almost certainly crash. This is often to do with variable &#x27;typing&#x27; – for example, a simple calculation program would expect a number as an input: any other type of input such as a text string or even a null (no value), would make any mathematical operation such as multiplication impossible. In order to guard against this possibility, programmers defined initial values that would be used if the user *defaulted* or failed to fulfill the obligation of providing the correct input value. Over time, the term &#x27;default&#x27; has come to refer to the initial value itself.

==E==

* Ethernet – a computer networking technology.
:According to Robert Metcalfe (one of its initial developers), he devised the name in an early company memo as an endocentric compound of &quot;luminiferous ether&quot;—the &quot;substance&quot; that was widely believed to be the medium through which electromagnetic radiation propagated in the late 19th century—and &quot;net&quot;, short for &quot;network&quot;. When the networking team would describe data flowing into the network infrastructure, they would routinely describe it as data packets going &quot;up into the ether&quot;.

==F==

* finger – Unix command that provides information about users logged into a system.
:Les Earnest wrote the finger program in 1971 to provide for users who wanted information about other users on a network or system. According to Earnest, it was named after the act of pointing, because it &quot;bypassed the need to point to a user ID and ask, &#x27;Who is that?&#x27;&quot;

* foobar – from the U.S. Army slang acronym, FUBAR. Both &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot; are commonly used as metasyntactic variables.

==G==

* Gentoo – a Linux distribution.
:Named after a variety of penguin, the universal Linux mascot.

* Git – a distributed version control system.
:In the project&#x27;s initial README file, Linus Torvalds wrote that &quot;&#x27;git&#x27; can mean anything, depending on your mood&quot;, and offers several definitions:
:* A random three-letter combination which is pronounceable and not a preexisting Unix command
:* British English slang, meaning a stupid or contemptible person
:* An acronym for &quot;global information tracker&quot; (when it works)
:* An acronym for &quot;goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t&quot; (when it breaks)
:When asked about the origin of the name, Torvalds jokingly stated, &quot;I&#x27;m an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.&quot;

* GNU – a project with an original goal of creating a free operating system.
:Gnu (also called wildebeest) are a genus of African antelopes resembling cattle. The founder of the GNU project Richard Stallman liked the name because of the humour associated with its pronunciation (officially, ), and was also influenced by &quot;The Gnu Song&quot;, by Flanders and Swann, which is sung by a gnu. It is also an early example of a recursive acronym: &quot;GNU&#x27;s Not Unix&quot;.

* Google – a search engine.
:The name started as an exaggerated boast about the amount of information the search engine would be able to search. It was originally named &#x27;Googol&#x27;, a word for the number represented by 1 followed by 100 zeros. The word was originally invented by Milton Sirotta, nephew of mathematician Edward Kasner, in 1938 during a discussion of large numbers and exponential notation.

* Gopher – an early protocol for distributing documents over a network. Declined in favor of the World Wide Web.
:The name was coined by developer Farhad Anklesaria, as a play on , an assistant who fetches things, and a gopher, who digs, as if through nested hierarchies. The name was also inspired by Goldy Gopher, the mascot for the University of Minnesota where the protocol was developed.

* grep – a Unix command line utility
:The name comes from a command in the Unix text editor ed that takes the form codice_1 meaning search globally for a regular expression and print lines where instances are found. &quot;Grep&quot; like &quot;Google&quot; is often used as a verb, meaning &quot;to search&quot;.

==H==

* Hotmail – free email service, now named Outlook.com.
:Founder Jack Smith got the idea of accessing e-mail via the web from a computer anywhere in the world. When Sabeer Bhatia came up with the business plan for the mail service, he tried all kinds of names ending in &#x27;mail&#x27; and finally settled for Hotmail as it included the letters &quot;HTML&quot; – the markup language used to write web pages. It was initially referred to as HoTMaiL with selective upper casing.

==I==

* i18n – short for &quot;internationalization&quot;.
:&quot;18&quot; is for the number of letters between the &quot;i&quot; and the &quot;n&quot;. Related, less common terms include &quot;l10n&quot; (for localization), &quot;g11n&quot; (for globalization) and &quot;a11y&quot; (for accessibility).

* ICQ – an instant messaging service.
: ICQ is not an initialism. It is a play on the phrase &quot;I seek you&quot; or &quot;Internet seek you&quot; (similar to CQ in ham radio usage).

* ID10T – pronounced &quot;ID ten T&quot; – is a code frequently used by a customer service representative (CSR) to annotate their notes and identify the source of a problem as the person who is reporting the problem rather than the system being blamed. This is a thinly veiled reference to the CSR&#x27;s opinion that the person reporting the problem is an IDIOT. Example: Problem reported caused by ID10T, no resolution possible. See also PEBKAC.

==J==

* Jakarta Project – a project constituted by Sun and Apache to create a web server for Java servlets and JSPs.
:Jakarta was the name of the conference room at Sun where most of the meetings between Sun and Apache took place. The conference room was most likely named after Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, which is located on the northwest coast of the island of Java.

* Java – a programming language by Sun Microsystems, later acquired by Oracle.
:Named after , a blend of coffee from the island of Java, and also used as slang for coffee in general. The language was initially called &quot;Greentalk&quot; and later &quot;Oak&quot;, but this was already trademarked by Oak Technologies, so the developers had to choose another name shortly before release. Other suggested names were &quot;WebRunner&quot;, &quot;DNA&quot;, and &quot;Silk&quot;.
* JavaScript – a programming language.
:It was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape under the name &quot;Mocha&quot;, which was later renamed to &quot;LiveScript&quot;, and finally to &quot;JavaScript&quot;. The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript roughly coincided with Netscape adding support for Java technology in its Netscape Navigator web browser. JavaScript was first introduced and deployed in the Netscape browser version 2.0B3 in December 1995. The naming has caused confusion, giving the impression that the language is a spin-off of Java, and it has been characterized by many as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give JavaScript the cachet of what was then the hot new web-programming language.

==K==

* Kerberos – a computer network authentication protocol that is used by both Windows 2000 and Windows XP as their default authentication method.
:When created by programmers at MIT in the 1970s, they wanted a name that suggested high security for the project, so they named it after &quot;Kerberos&quot;, in Greek mythology the three-headed dog guarding the gates of Hades. The reference to Greek mythology is most likely because Kerberos was developed as part of Project Athena.

==L==

* Linux – an operating system kernel, and the common name for many of the operating systems which use it.
:Linux creator Linus Torvalds originally used the MINIX operating system on his computer, didn&#x27;t like it, liked DOS less, and started a project to develop an operating system that would address the problems of MINIX. Hence the working name was &quot;Linux&quot; (Linus&#x27; Minix). Originally, however, Linus had planned to have it named &quot;Freax&quot; (&quot;free&quot; + &quot;freak&quot; + &quot;x&quot;). His friend Ari Lemmke encouraged Linus to upload it to a network so it could be easily downloaded. Ari gave Linus a directory named &quot;linux&quot; on his FTP server, as he did not like the name &quot;Freax&quot;.

* Lisa – A personal computer designed at Apple Computer during the early 1980s.
:Apple stated that Lisa was an acronym for &quot;Local Integrated Software Architecture&quot;; however, it is often inferred that the machine was originally named after the daughter of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, and that this acronym was invented later to fit the name. Accordingly, two humorous suggestions for expanding the acronym included &quot;Let&#x27;s Invent Some Acronyms&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Invent Silly Acronyms&quot;.

* liveware – computer personnel. 
:A play on the terms &quot;software&quot; and &quot;hardware&quot;. Coined in 1966, the word indicates that sometimes the computer problem is not with the computer itself, but with the user.

* Lotus Software – Lotus founder Mitch Kapor got the name for his company from &#x27;The Lotus Position&#x27; (&#x27;Padmasana&#x27; in Sanskrit). Kapor used to be a teacher of Transcendental Meditation technique as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

==M==

* Macintosh, Mac – a personal computer from Apple Computer.
:From McIntosh, a popular type of apple.

==N==

* Nerd – A colloquial term for a computer person, especially an obsessive, singularly focused one. Originally created by Dr. Seuss from his book If I Ran the Zoo.

==O==

* Oracle – a relational database management system (RDBMS).
:Larry Ellison, Ed Oates and Bob Miner were working on a consulting project for the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency). The code name for the project was &quot;Oracle&quot; (the CIA evidently saw this as a system that would give answers to all questions). The project was designed to use the newly written SQL database language from IBM. The project eventually was terminated but they decided to finish what they started and bring it to the world. They kept the name &quot;Oracle&quot; and created the RDBMS engine.

==P==

* Pac-Man – a video arcade game.
: The term comes from &quot;paku paku&quot; which is a Japanese onomatopoeia used for noisy eating; similar to &quot;chomp chomp&quot;. The game was released in Japan with the name &quot;Puck-Man&quot;, and released in the US with the name &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, fearing that kids may deface a Puck-Man cabinet by changing the &quot;P&quot; to an &quot;F&quot;.

*Patch – A set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it.
: Historically, software suppliers distributed patches on paper tape or on punched cards, expecting the recipient to cut out the indicated part of the original tape (or deck), and patch in (hence the name) the replacement segment

* PCMCIA – the standards body for PC card and ExpressCard, expansion card form factors.
: The Personal Computer Memory Card International Association is an international standards body that defines and promotes standards for expansion devices such as modems and external hard disk drives to be connected to notebook computers. Over time, the acronym PCMCIA has been used to refer to the PC card form factor used on notebook computers. A twist on the acronym is People Can&#x27;t Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms.

* PEBKAC – an acronym for &quot;Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair&quot;, which is a code frequently used by a customer service representative (CSR) to annotate their notes and identify the source of a problem as the person who is reporting the problem rather than the system being blamed. This is a thinly veiled reference to the CSR&#x27;s opinion that the person reporting the problem is the problem. Example: PEBKAC, no resolution possible. See also &quot;ID10T&quot;.
* Pentium – a series of microprocessors from Intel.
:The fifth microprocessor in the 80x86 series. It would have been named i586 or 80586, but Intel decided to name it &quot;Pentium&quot; (penta = five) after it lost a trademark infringement lawsuit against AMD due to a judgment that numbers like &quot;286&quot;, &quot;386&quot;, and &quot;486&quot; cannot be trademarked. According to Intel, &quot;Pentium&quot; conveys a meaning of strength, like titanium.

:Since some early Pentium chips contained a mathematical precision error, it has been jokingly suggested that the reason for the chip being named Pentium rather than 586 was that Intel chips would calculate 486 + 100 = 585.99999948.

* Perl – an interpreted scripting language.
:Perl was originally named &quot;Pearl&quot;, after the &quot;pearl of great price&quot; of Matthew 13:46. Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, wanted to give the language a short name with positive connotations and claims to have looked at (and rejected) every three- and four-letter word in the dictionary. He even thought of naming it after his wife Gloria. Before the language&#x27;s official release Wall discovered that there was already a programming language named &quot;Pearl&quot;, and changed the spelling of the name. Although the original manuals suggested the backronyms &quot;Practical Extraction and Report Language&quot; and &quot;Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister&quot;, these were intended humorously.

* PHP – a server-side scripting language
:Originally named &quot;Personal Home Page Tools&quot; by creator Rasmus Lerdorf, it was rewritten by developers Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans who gave it the recursive name &quot;PHP Hypertext Preprocessor&quot;. Lerdorf currently insists the name should not be thought of as standing for anything, for he selected &quot;Personal Home Page&quot; as the name when he did not foresee PHP evolving into a general-purpose programming language.

* Pine – e-mail client.
:Many people believe that Pine stands for &quot;Pine Is Not Elm&quot;. However, one of its original authors, Laurence Lundblade, insists this was never the case and that it started off simply as a word and not an acronym; his first choice of a backronym for pine would be &quot;Pine Is Nearly Elm&quot;. Over time it was changed to mean &quot;Program for Internet News and E-mail&quot;.

* ping – a computer network tool used to detect hosts.
:The author of ping, Mike Muuss, named it after the pulses of sound made by a sonar called a &quot;ping&quot;. Later Dave Mills provided the backronym &quot;Packet Internet Groper&quot;.

* Python – an interpreted scripting programming language.
:Named after the television series Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus.

==R==

* Radio button – a GUI widget used for making selections.
:Radio buttons got their name from the preset buttons in radio receivers. When one used to select preset stations on a radio receiver physically instead of electronically, depressing one preset button would pop out whichever other button happened to be pushed in.

* Red Hat Linux – a Linux distribution from Red Hat.
:Company founder Marc Ewing was given the Cornell lacrosse team cap (with red and white stripes) by his grandfather while at college. People would turn to him to solve their problems, and he was referred to as &quot;that guy in the red hat&quot;. He lost the cap and had to search for it desperately. The manual of the beta version of Red Hat Linux had an appeal to readers to return the hat if found by anyone.

* RSA – an asymmetric algorithm for public key cryptography.
:Based on the surnames of the authors of this algorithm – Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman.

==S==

* Samba – a free implementation of Microsoft&#x27;s networking protocol.
:The name &quot;samba&quot; comes from inserting two vowels into the name of the standard protocol that Microsoft Windows network file system use, named Server Message Block (SMB). The author searched a dictionary using &quot;grep&quot; for words containing S M and B in that order; the only matches were &quot;Samba&quot; and &quot;Salmonberry&quot;.

* shareware – coined by Bob Wallace to describe his word processor PC-Write in early 1983. Before this Jim Knopf (also known as Jim Button) and Andrew Fluegelman called their distributed software &quot;user supported software&quot; and &quot;freeware&quot; respectively, but it was Wallace&#x27;s terminology that prevailed.
* spam – unwanted repetitious messages, such as unsolicited bulk e-mail.
: The term &quot;spam&quot; is derived from the Monty Python SPAM sketch, set in a cafe where everything on the menu includes SPAM luncheon meat. While a customer plaintively asks for some kind of food without SPAM in it, the server reiterates the SPAM-filled menu. Soon, a chorus of Vikings join in with a song: &quot;SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, SPAM, lovely SPAM, wonderful SPAM&quot;, over and over again, drowning out all conversation.

* SPIM – a simulator for a virtual machine closely resembling the instruction set of MIPS processors, is simply MIPS spelled backwards. In recent time, &quot;spim&quot; has also come to mean SPam sent over Instant Messaging.
* Swing – a graphics library for Java.
:&quot;Swing&quot; was the code-name of the project that developed the new graphic components (the successor of AWT). It was named after swing, a style of dance band jazz that was popularized in the 1930s and unexpectedly revived in the 1990s. Although an unofficial name for the components, it gained popular acceptance with the use of the word in the package names for the Swing API, which begin with codice_2.

==T==

* Tomcat – a web server from the Jakarta Project.
:&quot;Tomcat&quot; was the code-name for the JSDK 2.1 project inside Sun. Tomcat started off as a servlet specification implementation by James Duncan Davidson who was a software architect at Sun. Davidson had initially hoped that the project would be made open-source, and since most open-source projects had O&#x27;Reilly books on them with an animal on the cover, he wanted to name the project after an animal. He came up with Tomcat since he reasoned the animal represented something that could take care of and fend for itself.

* troff – a document processing system for Unix.
:&quot;Troff&quot; stands for &quot;typesetter roff&quot;, although many people have speculated that it actually means &quot;Times roff&quot; because of the use of the Times font family in troff by default. Troff has its origins from roff, an earlier formatting program, whose name is a contraction of &quot;run off&quot;.

* Trojan horse – a malicious program that is disguised as legitimate software.
:The term is derived from the classical myth of the Trojan Horse. Analogously, a Trojan horse appears innocuous (or even to be a gift), but in fact is a vehicle for bypassing security.

* Tux – The penguin mascot used as the primary logo for the Linux kernel, and Linux-based operating systems.
:Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, suggested a penguin mascot because he &quot;likes penguins a lot&quot;, and wanted Linux to be associated with something &quot;kind of goofy and fun&quot;. The logo was originally created by Larry Ewing in 1996 as an entry in a Linux Logo competition. The name Tux was contributed by James Hughes, who suggested &quot;(T)orvolds (U)ni(X) — TUX!&quot;

==U==

* Ubuntu Linux – a Debian-based Linux distribution sponsored by Canonical Ltd.
:Derived from ubuntu, a South African ideology.

* Unix – an operating system.
:When Bell Labs pulled out of the MULTiplexed Information and Computing System (MULTICS) project, which was originally a joint Bell Labs/GE/MIT project, Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, soon joined by Dennis Ritchie, wrote a simpler version of the operating system for a spare DEC minicomputer, allegedly found in a corridor. They needed an OS to run the game &quot;Space Travel&quot;, which had been compiled under MULTICS. The new OS was named UNICS – UNiplexed Information and Computing System by Brian Kernighan.

==V==

* vi – a text editor,
:Initialism for visual, a command in the ex editor which helped users to switch to the visual mode from the ex mode. the first version was written by Bill Joy at UC Berkeley.

* Vim – a text editor.
:Acronym for Vi improved after Vim added several features over the vi editor. Vim however had started out as an imitation of Vi and was expanded as Vi imitation.

* Virus – a piece of program code that spreads by making copies of itself.
:The term &quot;virus&quot; was first used as a technical computer science term by Fred Cohen in his 1984 paper &quot;Computer Viruses Theory and Experiments&quot;, where he credits Len Adleman with coining it. Although Cohen&#x27;s use of &quot;virus&quot; may have been the first academic use, it had been in the common parlance long before that. A mid-1970s science fiction novel by David Gerrold, &quot;When H.A.R.L.I.E. was One&quot;, includes a description of a fictional computer program named &quot;VIRUS&quot; that worked just like a virus (and was countered by a program named &quot;ANTIBODY&quot;). The term &quot;computer virus&quot; also appears in the comic book &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; No. 158, published in 1982. A computer virus&#x27;s basic function is to insert its own executable code into that of other existing executable files, literally making it the electronic equivalent to the biological virus, the basic function of which is to insert its genetic information into that of the invaded cell, forcing the cell to reproduce the virus.

==W==

* Wiki or WikiWiki – a hypertext document collection or the collaborative software used to create it.
:Coined by Ward Cunningham, the creator of the wiki concept, who named them for the &quot;wiki wiki&quot; or &quot;quick&quot; shuttle buses at Honolulu Airport. Wiki wiki was the first Hawaiian term he learned on his first visit to the islands. The airport counter agent directed him to take the wiki wiki bus between terminals.

* Worm – a self-replicating program, similar to a virus.
: The name &#x27;worm&#x27; was taken from a 1970s science fiction novel by John Brunner entitled &quot;The Shockwave Rider&quot;. The book describes programs known as &quot;tapeworms&quot; which spread through a network for the purpose of deleting data. Researchers writing an early paper on experiments in distributed computing noted the similarities between their software and the program described by Brunner, and adopted that name.

* WYSIWYG – describes a system in which content during editing appears very similar to the final product.
:Acronym for &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot;, the phrase was originated by a newsletter published by Arlene and Jose Ramos, named WYSIWYG. It was created for the emerging Pre-Press industry going electronic in the late 1970s.

==X==

* X Window System – a windowing system for computers with bitmap displays.
:X derives its name as a successor to a pre-1983 window system named the W Window System.

==Y==

* Yahoo! – internet portal and web directory.
:Yahoo!&#x27;s history site says the name is an acronym for &quot;Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle&quot;, but some remember that in its early days (mid-1990s), when Yahoo! lived on a server named akebono.stanford.edu, it was glossed as &quot;Yet Another Hierarchical Object Organizer.&quot; The word &quot;Yahoo!&quot; was originally invented by Jonathan Swift and used in his book &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. It represents a person who is repulsive in appearance and action and is barely human. Yahoo! founders Jerry Yang and David Filo selected the name because they considered themselves yahoos.

==Z==

* zip – a file format, also used as a verb to mean &quot;compress&quot;.
:The file format was created by Phil Katz, and given the name by his friend Robert Mahoney. The compression tool Phil Katz created was named PKZIP. Zip means &quot;speed&quot;, and they wanted to imply their product would be faster than ARC and other compression formats of the time.

<doc id="390336" wikidata="Q182793" url="?curid=390336" title="Nixon's Enemies List">
<text>&quot;Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List&quot; is the informal name of what started as a list of President of the United States Richard Nixon&#x27;s major political opponents compiled by Charles Colson, written by George T. Bell (assistant to Colson, special counsel to the White House), and sent in memorandum form to John Dean on September 9, 1971. The list was part of a campaign officially known as &quot;Opponents List&quot; and &quot;Political Enemies Project&quot;.

The list became public knowledge on June 27, 1973, when Dean mentioned during hearings with the Senate Watergate Committee that a list existed containing those whom the president did not like. Journalist Daniel Schorr, who happened to be on the list, managed to obtain a copy of it later that day.

A longer second list was made public by Dean on December 20, 1973, during a hearing with the Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation.

==Purpose==

The official purpose, as described by the White House Counsel&#x27;s Office, was to &quot;screw&quot; Nixon&#x27;s political enemies, by means of tax audits from the Internal Revenue Service, and by manipulating &quot;grant availability, federal contracts, litigation, prosecution, etc.&quot; In a memorandum from John Dean to Lawrence Higby (August 16, 1971), Dean explained the purpose of the list:

The IRS commissioner, Donald C. Alexander, refused to launch audits of the people on the list. While none on the list were audited, several major donors to the presidential campaign of George McGovern did get audited in 1973, prompting a later remark from Karl Hess, &quot;The right of the victor of a presidential election is to the authority to audit the losers&quot;.

==People listed==
The twenty names in the memo were as follows, although a master list of Nixon&#x27;s political opponents with additional names was developed later.

*Arnold Picker, film executive
*Alexander E. Barkan, head of the AFL-CIO&#x27;s Committee on Political Education
*Edwin Guthman, journalist
*Maxwell Dane, advertising executive
*Charles Dyson, businessman
*Howard Stein, financier
*Rep. Allard Lowenstein (D-NY), congressman
*Morton Halperin, foreign policy expert
*Leonard Woodcock, president of the United Auto Workers
*S. Sterling Munro Jr., aide of former Washington Senator Henry M. Jackson
*Bernard T. Feld, professor
*Sidney Davidoff, lawyer
*Rep. John Conyers (D-MI), congressman
*Samuel M. Lambert, executive secretary of the National Education Association
*Stewart Rawlings Mott, philanthropist
*Rep. Ron Dellums (D-CA), congressman
*Daniel Schorr, journalist
*S. Harrison Dogole, president of Globe Security Systems
*Paul Newman, actor
*Mary McGrory, journalist

==Master list of political opponents==

According to Dean, Colson later compiled hundreds of names on a &quot;master list&quot; which changed constantly. On December 20, 1973, the Congressional Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation concluded that people on the &quot;Enemies&quot; list had &quot;not&quot; been subjected to an unusual number of tax audits. The report revealed a second list of about 576 (with some duplicates) supporters and staffers of George McGovern&#x27;s 1972 presidential campaign given to Internal Revenue Commissioner Johnnie Walters by John Dean on September 11, 1972. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; printed the entire list the next day, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported just a few paragraphs on page 21.

== Reception ==
Newsman Daniel Schorr and actor Paul Newman stated, separately, that inclusion on the list was their greatest accomplishment. When this list was released, Schorr read it live on television, not realizing that he was on the list until he came to his own name. Author Hunter S. Thompson remarked he was disappointed he was not on it.

==In popular culture==
In the United States, the term &quot;enemies list&quot; has come to be used in contexts not associated with Richard Nixon. For example, satirist P. J. O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s 1989 &quot;A Call for a New McCarthyism&quot; in &quot;The American Spectator&quot; has a hybrid blacklist and enemies list, suggesting that, contrary to the spirits of these lists, the subjects there should be overexposed, not suppressed, &quot;so that a surfeited public rebels in disgust.&quot;

In Philip Roth&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot;, which was published in 1971, two years before the list was first mentioned in public, the Nixon parody character Trick E. Dixon begins to compile a rudimentary list of five political enemies. It includes Jane Fonda and the Black Panthers who were on the real-life expanded master list, The Berrigans (who were not) and Curt Flood.

In &quot;Homer&#x27;s Enemy&quot; (1997), an 8th-season episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Moe Szyslak shows off his own enemies list, which Barney Gumble quickly appraises as Nixon&#x27;s list, with the latter&#x27;s name crossed out and replaced with Moe&#x27;s. Moe promptly adds Barney to the list for his insolence. An earlier episode was also a likely reference to the enemies&#x27; list when Homer falls to the floor as a result of a shoddy chair. In anger, Homer remarks that the manufacturer &quot;just made the list!&quot;.

In &quot;Futurama&quot;″s first episode, &quot;Space Pilot 3000&quot; (1999), Fry and Bender walk through a room of live preserved heads of famous people. When Fry knocks over Nixon&#x27;s jar, Nixon says &quot;That&#x27;s it, you just made my list!&quot;

In a &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; second-season episode called &quot;The Shot&quot; (2015), the title character and Todd visit the Nixon Presidential Library with the intent of stealing a scaled-down replica of the library. Mounted on the walls are Nixon&#x27;s Enemy and &quot;Frenemy&quot; Lists. Walt Disney is included on the Enemy List.

<text>The royal tern (Thalasseus maximus) is a tern in the family Laridae. The species is endemic to the Americas, though vagrants have been identified in Europe.

==Taxonomy==
The royal tern was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-colored plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Sterna maxima&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The royal tern is now placed in the genus &quot;Thalasseus&quot; that was erected by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822.

The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek (&quot;thálassa&quot;) meaning &quot;sea&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;maximus&quot; is Latin for &quot;greatest&quot;.

The royal tern belongs to the class Aves and the order Charadriiformes. Charadriiformes includes seabirds and shorebirds of small to medium-large size. Within Charadriiformes, it is placed in the family Laridae, subfamily Sterninae, because of its white plumage, a black cap on its head, long bill, webbed feet, and bodies that are more streamlined than those of gulls.

The taxonomy of the royal tern has been debated, whether the correct scientific name was &quot;Thalasseus maximus&quot; or &quot;Sterna maxima&quot;. It was originally placed in the genus &quot;Sterna&quot;; however, a 2005 study found that the genus &quot;Thalasseus&quot; is genetically distinct from &quot;Sterna&quot;.; thus it is presently classified as &quot;Thalasseus maximus&quot;, which places it with seven other crested terns.

The West African crested tern (&quot;Thalasseus albididorsalis&quot;) was formerly considered to be a subspecies of royal tern. It was elevated to species status in January 2020.

==Description==


This is a large tern, second only to the Caspian tern but is unlikely to be confused with this &quot;carrot-billed&quot; giant, which has extensive dark underwing patches.

The royal tern has an orange-red bill, pale gray upperparts, and white underparts. Its legs are black. In winter, the black cap becomes patchy. Juvenile royal terns are similar to non-breeding adults. Differences include juveniles having black splotched wings and a yellower bill. An adult royal tern has an average wingspan of , for both sexes, but their wingspan can range from . Its length ranges from and their weight is anywhere from .

The calls of the royal tern are usually short, clear shrills. Some of the shrills sound like &quot;kree&quot; or &quot;tsirr&quot;; the royal tern also has a more plover-like whistle that is longer, rolling, and more melodious.

In parts of its range, the royal tern could be confused with the elegant tern, but the elegant tern has a longer but slenderer, more curved, bill, and shows more white on the forehead in winter. Vagrants in Europe need careful documentation to distinguish them from the same-sized West African crested tern, which has also been recorded in Europe.

==Distribution and habitat==
The royal tern is found on both coasts of the Americas. In the northeast, during the breeding season (April to July) it is primarily found from Texas to Virginia, with scattered breeding records as far north as Long Island, New York, and south to French Guiana, and on several Caribbean islands. It also breeds in the southeast from southeastern Brazil south to Chubut Province in Argentina. The wintering range in the east is from North Carolina south to Panama and the Guianas and throughout the Caribbean. The western population nests from California to Mexico and winters from California south to Peru. Argentinian breeders are resident or disperse into Brazil.

==Behavior==

===Feeding===
The royal tern typically feeds in small secluded bodies of water such as estuaries, mangroves, and lagoons. Also, but less frequently, the royal tern will hunt for fish in open water, typically within about of the shore. The royal tern feeds in salt water and on very rare occasions in fresh water. When feeding they fly long distances from the colony to forage. The royal tern feeds by diving into the water from heights near . They usually feed alone or in groups of two or three but on occasion, they feed in large groups when hunting large schools of fish.

The royal tern usually feeds on small fish such as anchovies, weakfish, and croakers. Fish are their main source of food but they also eat insects, shrimp,crabs, and hatchling sea turtles. The royal tern feeds on small crabs, such as young blue crabs that swim near the surface of the water. When feeding on small crabs the royal tern does not use its normal plunge-dive technique, but instead uses short shallow dives so that they are concealed from their prey. The royal tern also uses this technique when hunting flying fish.

===Breeding===

The royal tern nests on island beaches or isolated beaches with limited predators. It lays one or two eggs, usually in a scrape, an area on the ground where a tern has made a small hole to lay its eggs. In some cases, tern eggs are laid directly on the ground, not in a scrape. The eggs incubate from 25 to 30 days; after the eggs hatch the chicks remain in the scrape for about a week. About two weeks after hatching the chicks gather into groups called a crèche. When the chicks are in the crèche, they are primarily fed by their parents who recognize their offspring by their voice and looks. While the chicks are in the crèche, they usually roam freely around the colony. In a large colony, there can be thousands of chicks in the crèche. When the chicks are a month old they fledge or start to fly. Royal terns mature around the age of 4 years, after which they build their own nests and reproduce.

==Threats==

The royal tern has few predators when it is mature, but before the chicks hatch or while they are chicks the tern is threatened by humans, other animals, and the tides. Humans threaten terns by fishing and by disrupting the tern nesting sites. Fishing nets can catch a tern while it is diving, making it unable to feed or it may cause it to drown if it is caught underwater. Animals such as foxes, raccoons, and large gulls prey on tern chicks and tern eggs.

Tern nesting sites can also be affected by the tides; if a tern colony has nested too close to the high tide mark, a spring tide would flood the nesting site and kill the chicks and make unhatched eggs infertile.

==Conservation==

The IUCN has rated the royal tern as of Least Concern.

<text>The elegant tern (Thalasseus elegans) is a tern in the family Laridae. It breeds on the Pacific coast of southern California in the United States and western Mexico, and migrates south to Peru, Ecuador and Chile for the northern winter; in the late summer and fall, some also disperse north to Oregon and more rarely Washington.

This species breeds in very dense colonies on coasts and islands, including Isla Rasa and Montague Island in Mexico, and South Bay Salt Works (San Diego) and Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve in California. Exceptionally, in can occur as an accidental inland on suitable large freshwater lakes.

The elegant tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, almost invariably from the sea, like most &quot;Thalasseus&quot; terns. It usually dives directly, and not from the &quot;stepped-hover&quot; favored by the Arctic tern. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

This Pacific species has wandered to western Europe as a rare vagrant on a number of occasions. The first European record was at Carlingford Lough in County Down, Northern Ireland, in late June 1982. It has nested in Spain, and has interbred with a Sandwich tern in France. There is also one record from Cape Town, South Africa, in January 2006, the first record for Africa.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The current genus name is derived from Greek &quot;Thalassa&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;, and &quot;elegans&quot; is Latin for &quot;elegant, fine&quot;. Though described in 1822, the genus was largely treated as a synonym of &quot;Sterna&quot; until a 2005 study demonstrated that the systematics of the terns needed review.

The closest relative of the elegant tern is Cabot&#x27;s tern &quot;T. acuflavidus&quot;, which breeds on the Atlantic coasts of the Americas; this species pair is then next most closely related to the Old World Sandwich tern.

==Identification==
This is a medium-large tern, with a long, slender, slightly downcurved orange bill, pale gray upperparts and white underparts. It is long with an wingspan, and a weight of . Its legs are black. From late summer to winter, the forehead becomes white. Juvenile elegant terns have a scalier pale gray back. The call is a characteristic loud grating noise similar to other &quot;Thalasseus&quot; terns.

This bird can be confused with the royal tern, but the royal tern is larger and thicker-billed and shows more white on the forehead in winter. Out of range, it can also be easily confused with the lesser crested tern. See also orange-billed tern, and the external link below.

This species is marginally paler above than the lesser crested tern with a white (not gray) rump, with a slightly longer, more slender bill with a different curve. The black of the crest that comes down from the crown extends through the eye, creating a small black &quot;smudge&quot; in front of the eye even in winter plumage. On royal terns, the black crest stops at the eye, while lesser crested tern has a less shaggy crest.

==Ecology and conservation==
The total population is around 90,000 pairs, with the majority on islets in the Gulf of California. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one or two eggs. Unlike some of the smaller &quot;Sterna&quot; terns, it is not very aggressive toward potential predators, relying on the sheer density of the nests (often only 20–30 cm apart) and nesting close to other more aggressive species, such as Heermann&#x27;s gulls, to avoid predation. However, Heermann&#x27;s gulls do predate some eggs and chicks, though more significant predators are the much larger and more predatory western and yellow-footed gulls.

In May 2021, 1500 nests with thousands of eggs were abandoned when a drone crash landed near the nesting colony in Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, scaring off 2,500 nesting elegant terns and leading to a catastrophic loss.

<text>Mikuláš Dzurinda (; born 4 February 1955) is a Slovak politician who was the prime minister of Slovakia from 30 October 1998 to 4 July 2006. Dzurinda is the founder and leader of the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK) and then the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKÚ–DS). From 2002 to 2006, his party formed a coalition government with the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), the Alliance of the New Citizen (ANO), and the Party of the Hungarian Coalition (SMK–MKP).

Dzurinda&#x27;s second government was labeled as a reformist and pro-market. Reforms included a flat tax of 19%, pension reform (second pillar), and education financing reform (except colleges and universities). During his term, Slovakia joined both the European Union and NATO. Dzurinda later served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in Prime Minister Iveta Radičová&#x27;s coalition government from 2010 to 2012. On 3 December 2013, Dzurinda was elected as President of the Martens Centre, the think tank of the European People&#x27;s Party.

==Early life==

Dzurinda was born on 4 February 1955 in the eastern Slovak village of Spišský Štvrtok. He graduated from the College of Transport and Communications in Žilina in 1979. In 1988, he completed his post-graduate scientific research there and was awarded with a Candidate of Sciences (CSc.) degree. He worked for the Transport Research Institute (VÚD) in Žilina as an economic analyst (1979–1988). Later he was the director of an information technology section within the regional directorate of the Czechoslovak Railways (ČSD) in Bratislava (1988–1990). Dzurinda is married and has two daughters. He speaks Slovak, Czech, English, and French.

Dzurinda entered Slovak politics as one of the founding members of the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), a conservative political party officially constituted in 1990. The first democratic general election in Czechoslovakia was held in 1990, and he was appointed Deputy Minister of Transportation and Posts of the Slovak Government in 1991. In 1992 he became a member of the Slovak parliament (National Council of the Slovak Republic) and worked as a member of the Committee for Budget and Finance. At the time of the split of Czechoslovakia and the establishment of an independent Slovakia (1993), he was KDH Deputy Chairman responsible for economy. During the tenure of Jozef Moravčík as Prime Minister (March–October 1994), Dzurinda was Minister of Transportation, Posts and Public Works. Following the 1994 general election, won by Vladimír Mečiar, he returned to the opposition as a member of the parliament.

==Prime Minister 1998–2002==

In response to the Election Act prepared and approved by Mečiar&#x27;s government in 1997, five opposition parties (Christian Democratic Movement/KDH, Democratic Party/DS, Democratic Union/DU, Social Democratic Party of Slovakia/SDSS and the Green Party of Slovakia/SZS) formed the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK). Dzurinda became its spokesman, and later, on 4 July 1998, its chairman. Dzurinda was appointed as prime minister for the first time in October 1998, leading five opposition parties united as the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDK) and defeating the government of Vladimír Mečiar at the polls.

Under Dzurinda&#x27;s leadership Slovakia managed to re-enter integration processes and registered a political comeback in relations both with the European Union and trans-Atlantic economic and political structures. The success of the reforms put through by his cabinet were best reflected in Slovakia&#x27;s entry into the OECD in September 2000, completion of accession negotiations with the European Union and the entry of major investors into the Slovak market. The U.S. Steel investment, for example, came with a pledge to invest more than a billion dollars here over the next decade.

In January 2000 he founded a new political party, the Slovak Democratic and Christian Union (SDKÚ), which he has chaired since. In an intra-party election in March 2002, SDKU members confirmed his leading position and following the September 2002 general election he was given the opportunity to again form the Slovak government. The Party of the Hungarian Coalition (SMK), Christian Democratic Union (KDH) and the Alliance of the New Citizen (ANO) have joined the SDKU in the ruling coalition. The Free Forum split from the SDKU in early 2004.

==Prime Minister 2002–2006==

The reformist course of Dzurinda&#x27;s policies was confirmed by a mandate he was given by electors in the 2002 general election to form his second government. It was also a year when the NATO Prague Summit in November decided on Slovakia&#x27;s invitation to join NATO; and the country also completed accession talks with the EU at the Copenhagen Summit in December, thus launching its ratification process. During this period, the budget deficit has been reduced to less than 3 percent of GDP, and it opened the door for Slovakia to join the eurozone in 2009. Economic growth, higher than 6 per cent, has become the fastest in the region. Nevertheless, foreign investors has discovered the country, notably car companies such as PSA Peugeot-Citroën and Kia.

The government of Mikuláš Dzurinda has been praised by the World Bank as the best market reformer in the world. Flat tax rate 19 per cent for income, corporates and value added tax led Steve Forbes to call Slovakia an &quot;investors&#x27; paradise&quot;. But country was still facing many challenges, especially in rural areas. Unemployment increased to 20 percent under Dzurinda&#x27;s first government, and was still at 12% when he left office, one of the highest rates in Europe. Dzurinda&#x27;s party was defeated by SMER in the 2006 parliamentary election. SDKU-DS was second with more than 18 per cent of votes. Because of refusal to renew the right-wing coalition government with the support of Meciar&#x27;s party he was not able to continue governing. SMER leader Robert Fico has formed a coalition government with Meciar&#x27;s HZDS and Slota&#x27;s Slovak National Party (SNS).

==Dzurinda in opposition 2006–2010==

Mikuláš Dzurinda has been a regular MP in the National Council of the Slovak Republic since his party&#x27;s defeat in the 2006 parliamentary elections. In February 2008, Juraj Liška, SDKÚ-DS&#x27;s deputy leader, openly asked Dzurinda to resign as the party leader due to the low party polls and the arguably undemocratic style of leadership. The members of the party presidium denied Liška&#x27;s accusations and since the presidium assembly, Liška has been unwilling to speak out on the inner affairs of the party. This affair led to the open protests against Dzurinda from party members from Bratislava. Since their exclusion from the party by a regular party judge there are no longer any thrills in the party.

==Minister of Foreign Affairs 2010–2012==
Dzurinda was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of prime minister Iveta Radičová on 9 July 2010. He was again elected to be the chairman of the SDKÚ-DS party on 6 November 2010 for next four years. He was only one candidate, the incumbent prime minister Radičová (from the same party) declined the nomination for candidacy.

==Public image==
Dzurinda has been known for his enthusiasm for cycling and especially long distance running, cultivating an image of a healthy and competitive person. After the Dzurinda led-coalition defeated the autocratic Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar, Dzurinda became unpopular with the People&#x27;s Party - Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (ĽS-HZDS) electorate. While the media routinely covered ĽS-HZDS political meetings full of anti-Dzurinda rants, the most iconic representation of this antipathy was recorded by journalist Karol Lovaš at a ĽS-HZDS meeting in support of Gustav Krajči where a large group of 70- and 80-year-old citizens repeatedly shouted the slogan &quot;Dzurinda is a Gypsy&quot;. Internationally, Dzurinda is perceived as a successful and progressive politician, mostly due to the internationally acclaimed economic reforms his government implemented during Dzurinda&#x27;s second government (2002–2006). In 2006, United States president George W. Bush called Dzurinda a friend and issued his admiration.

==Other activities==

Dzurinda has lectured at North American and European universities, and to both experts and public audiences. He is a strong advocate of trans-Atlantic ties. He has met and talked personally to leading foreign politicians, including U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, European Commission President Romano Prodi, NATO Secretary General Lord George Robertson, and several influential US senators and congressmen. Under his leadership, the Visegrád Group—a co-operative grouping of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia—was revived and gained new stimuli.

Dzurinda serves on the Leadership Council for Concordia,a nonpartisan, nonprofit based in New York City focused on promoting effective public-private collaboration to create a more prosperous and sustainable future. Dzurinda is a keen marathoner. He has taken part in the International Peace Marathon (MMM) in Košice 13 times, he ran the Lesser Carpathians Marathon (in 1986 in his personal best of 2 hours, 54 minutes and 57 seconds) and in 1996 the Rajec Marathon. In 2001, as Slovakia&#x27;s prime minister, he took part in the famous New York City Marathon, completing the 42.195-km course in 3 hours, 42 minutes. On 13 April 2003 he ran his second foreign marathon, held in London. He mended his final time at 3 hours 36 minutes. When speaking to the BBC presenter, he aired his hopes for a Slovakia as part of the EU, which occurred in 2004.

<text>3DLABS Inc. Ltd. was a fabless semiconductor company. It was founded by Yavuz Ahıska and Osman Kent in 1994 with headquarters in San Jose, California. It originally developed the GLINT and PERMEDIA high-end graphics chip technology that was used on many of the world&#x27;s leading computer graphics cards in the CAD and DCC markets, including its own Wildcat and Oxygen cards.

In 2006 the company focused development efforts on its emerging media processing business, and in 2009 became the Singapore-based ZiiLABS.

== History ==

3Dlabs was formed from a management buy-out of DuPont Pixel Systems in the UK in April 1994 and went public on Nasdaq in October 1996. 3Dlabs acquired Dynamic Pictures in July 1998 and the Intense3D division of Intergraph in July 2000. It was itself acquired by Creative Labs in June 2002. In February 2006, 3Dlabs announced that it would stop developing professional 3D graphics chips and focus on embedded and mobile media processors.

3Dlabs was an early pioneer in bringing 3D graphics to the PC. Its GLINT 300SX graphics processor was the industry&#x27;s first single chip, 3D-capable graphics device that was shipped on graphics boards from multiple vendors. Gamma was the first single chip graphics geometry processor for the PC. Permedia was the first low-cost OpenGL accelerator chip. 3Dlabs was a member of the OpenGL Architecture Review Board and played an important role in the development of OpenGL 2.0 and ongoing evolution of the OpenGL API.

The new media processor business was developed out of the original UK R&amp;D center with most of the workstation graphics teams that came from Intense3D and Dynamic Pictures having been hired by Intel and NVIDIA.

In November 2006 3Dlabs introduced the DMS-02, its first media processor capable of 720P HD Video for portable devices. In January 2009 the SoC team merged with a Creative product division and rebranded as ZiiLABS. It claimed the new company was to offer processors and complete market-ready hardware and software platforms to consumer OEMs and ODMs.

== Media processors ==
The ZMS processors are based on a low-power multicore architecture including dual ARM cores for handling traditional CPU tasks plus a closely coupled, fully programmable SIMD array processor to do the heavy lifting for intensive media processing tasks such as; 2D graphics, 3D graphics, video decode/encode, image processing and floating point (32-bit IEEE). The processors integrate on-chip peripherals and interfaces suitable for a broad range of handheld and embedded devices.

Originally developed under the 3Dlabs name, the processor-related products are now sold and supported by ZiiLABS.

<doc id="390362" wikidata="Q430529" url="?curid=390362" title="Forster's tern">
<text>Forster&#x27;s tern (Sterna forsteri) is a tern in the family Laridae. The genus name &quot;Sterna&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;stearn&quot;, &quot;tern&quot;, and &quot;forsteri&quot; commemorates the naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster.

It breeds inland in North America in the northern United States and southern Canada, and migrates south to winter in the southern United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, and northern Central America. It is also a rare but annual vagrant in western Europe, and has wintered in Ireland and Great Britain on a number of occasions.

This species breeds in colonies in marshes. It nests in a ground scrape and lays two or more eggs. Like all white terns, it is fiercely defensive of its nest and young.

The Forster&#x27;s tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, but will also hawk for insects in its breeding marshes. It usually feeds from saline environments in winter, like most &quot;Sterna&quot; terns. It usually dives directly, and not from the &quot;stepped-hover&quot; favored by the Arctic tern. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.

This is a medium-small tern, long with a wingspan and a weight ranging from 130 to 190 g (4.6-6.7 oz ). It is most similar to the common tern, with pale gray upperparts and white underparts. Its legs are red and its bill is red, tipped with black. In winter, the forehead becomes white and a characteristic black eye mask remains. Juvenile Forster&#x27;s terns are similar to the winter adult. The call is similar to that of common terns, but also some harsher sounds suggestive of a small gull like Bonaparte&#x27;s gull.

This species is unlikely to be confused with the common tern in winter because of the black eye mask, but is much more similar in breeding plumage. Forster&#x27;s has a gray center to its white tail, and the upperwings are whiter, without the darker primary wedge of the common tern.

==Description==

Forster&#x27;s tern is a medium-sized tern with a slender body, deeply forked long tail and relatively long legs.

In its non-breeding plumage, the crown is white and a black comma-shaped patch covers the eye and the ear-covert. The wings are gray with the primaries being dark silvery gray, while the underside is white. The bill is black and the legs are a dull brownish red.

When breeding, an intense black cap extending down the neck appears. The wings and the back are pale gray while the underside is bright white. It has a black-tipped orange bill and bright orange legs.

The juveniles have coloring similar to a non-breeding adult but often have darker primaries.

==Taxonomy==

Forster&#x27;s tern is a member of the gull and tern family Laridae; it has also been treated like other terns in their own family Sternidae by some authors. Forster&#x27;s tern was named by Thomas Nuttall in honor of Johann Reinhold Forster, the German naturalist who first suggested it differed from the common tern. Its closest relative is the snowy-crowned tern (&quot;S. trudeaui&quot;) of South America; the two are sister species and basal to the rest of the genus &quot;Sterna&quot;.

==Habitat and distribution==

Forster&#x27;s tern is a marsh dwelling species. It can be found either in freshwater, brackish or saltwater. It is often found over shallow open water deep in the marsh. Main habitats are marshes, estuaries, islands, salt marshes and marshy areas surrounding lakes and streams.

Forster&#x27;s tern is usually restricted to North America. It nests in marshes during the summer, on both the Atlantic and Pacific coast, and also in the Prairies and on the Great Lakes in Canada and the US. Due to the instability of its nesting habitat, Forster&#x27;s tern exhibits a high annual turnover rate.

Forster&#x27;s tern also winters in marshes along the southern coast of the US and Mexico but can sometimes reach the northern extremity of Central America. It is also common for the tern to winter in the Caribbean.

It is a near-annual vagrant to Western Europe and has occasionally wintered in Great Britain and Ireland.

==Behavior==

Forster&#x27;s tern is often found in marshes over shallow open water. It is a shallow plunge-diver that often hovers before attacking. When hunting, its head is pointed downward whereas when travelling, it is pointed forward.

It is a colonial nesting species that builds a shallow nest using marsh vegetation and often competes with gulls for nesting sites. A breeding colony may vary in numbers from a few couples to a thousand individuals. In many occasions, Forster&#x27;s tern will share nesting sites with the yellow-headed blackbird.

Both parents are involved in brood care and Forster&#x27;s tern does not exhibit sex-specific differences in space use. Males tend to guard the nest more often during the day while the female is more present at night. When disturbed, newborn chicks tend to crouch and remain silent. Forster&#x27;s tern is a single prey loader and provision chicks with prey correlated to their size.

Before breeding, males practice courtship feeding.

===Vocalization===

The common call of the Forster&#x27;s tern is a descending kerr. The threat call used in defensive attack is a low harsh zaar. A succession of kerrs is used by the female as a begging call during courtship.

===Diet and feeding===

The major constituent of Forster&#x27;s tern diet is fish. Carp, minnow, sunfish, trout, perch, killifish, stickleback and shiner are common prey in freshwater, whereas pompano, herring, menhaden and shiner perch are often consumed in brackish or marine habitats. On the West Coast of the United States and Canada, Forster&#x27;s tern is also known to prey on Pacific lamprey juveniles. Insects such as dragonflies, caddisflies and grasshoppers are often consumed, but aquatic insect larvae, crustaceans and amphibian can complement the diet.

The Forster&#x27;s tern is a shallow plunge-diver, having its head pointing downward when hunting. The attack usually starts in a hovering position before initiating a headfirst dive with wings partially folded backward. Insects may occasionally be caught by the wing and prey are swallowed in the air. Prey handling behavior may include dropping and re-catching fish before swallowing them. In some areas, Forster&#x27;s tern tends to prefer forage to turbid water. This may prevent detection but it may also be a sign of higher prey density and increased presence near the surface. Preferences for water clarity may depend on prey availability.

===Reproduction===

The breeding season for Forster&#x27;s tern can start as early as April on the Gulf Coast of the United States and extend from May to mid-June depending on latitude. Forster&#x27;s tern is a colonial nester with colony size ranging from one to a thousand nests. Adults establish a very small territory around the nest and nests are usually clumped together. Males will practice courtship feeding and females will beg for food using a kerr kerr kerr call.

A typical clutch of eggs ranges from two to four. The incubation period may last 24 or 25 days after laying. The young are semi-precocial with shell removal being done by the parents. The chicks have upper- and lower-mandible egg teeth, which they lose three to five days after hatching. The chicks usually leave the nest with the parents four days post hatching and move into areas of denser vegetation. Fledging occurs 28 days after hatching. After a few weeks of fledging, young terns leave the natal colony but join the group for roosting, while migrating towards the wintering ground.

There is a similar involvement from both male and female in incubation and chick rearing. Males tend to incubate the eggs diurnally and females, mostly nocturnally. Reproductive success varies from year to year and from colony to colony.

===Mobbing===

Forster&#x27;s tern exhibits very aggressive behavior when threatened by nest predators; if a nest is disturbed, the colony mobs the aggressor, diving towards it and issuing loud calls. Aggressiveness increases immediately prior to and during hatching of the chicks. Ducks and grebes nesting in the same area often benefit from the tern&#x27;s aggressive behavior toward potential predators 

Yellow-headed blackbirds sharing nesting sites have been known to actively join tern mobs against predators. Western grebes recognize the tern&#x27;s alarm call; this can be interpreted as information parasitism.

==Nest==

Forster&#x27;s terns tend to nest in marshy areas, either in freshwater or in estuaries. The nests are usually located deep within the marsh, either on tidal islands or evaporation pond islands, but also on manmade dikes. Nests are composed of adjacent marsh vegetation. Many nests are considered floating and are made of marsh grasses, then can be set on top of the vegetation or deposited on floating rafts of vegetation. In Manitoba, there is a strong association between Forster&#x27;s tern nests and muskrat houses. They are, in fact, highly solicited nesting grounds. Also in Manitoba, &quot;Scirpus&quot; and often &quot;Typha&quot; are the main plants used for nest building.

In the case of large colonies, nesting area availability decreases. Forster&#x27;s tern will then nest on sand, gravel or mud. The nests will consist of a hollow in the substrates, either lined with grass or not and driftwood, shells, dried fish, bones and feathers are also often used.

Floating nests are usually tolerant to a slight increase or decrease of water levels but re-nesting is common. Strong wave action, wind or flooding, usually induced by storms, can often damage the nest and eggs. Weather is the main explanation for nest failure and egg loss. Unsheltered nests are more prone to destruction than sheltered ones. Nest made on higher ground are also more shielded from flooding but are more exposed to the wind.

Forster&#x27;s Terns have been recorded using man-made platforms, most notably in Wisconsin, where they were built to substitute for the Cat Island Chain. They demonstrated overall success, with Forster&#x27;s Terns preferring to use them to avoid the vulnerabilities that come with a natural nest.

===Eggs===

The egg&#x27;s primary color ranges from a greenish to a brownish hue. They are evenly spotted with dark brown, almost black or gray spots. There are color variations between and within clutches; earlier eggs are usually paler, greener and larger. Coloration of the eggs may vary depending on location. Whitish or cream colored eggs have also been reported.

==Predator==

Raptors such as falcons and hawks, as well as owls and crows may prey on adults and young. There have also been anecdotal reports of snapping turtles preying on young still in the nest. American bittern, great blue heron, and black-crowned night heron are also possible predators while gulls and Caspian terns notably prey on the eggs of the Forster&#x27;s tern.

When their ranges overlap, marsh rice rats are possibly the most efficient Forster&#x27;s tern egg predator. American mink are also one of few mammalian predators that can venture in the marsh and prey on eggs and young.

Predator success usually remains low during breeding season due to the aggressive mobbing response of adults.

==Status and conservation==

According to the IUCN, the status of the Forster&#x27;s tern is of little concern, however, degradation of marsh habitat may be threatening. Boating activity may also affect nest vegetation and increase erosion, which may lead to further degradation of tern nesting grounds. Excessive noise may also have caused nest desertion and chick mortality. This species is listed under the Migratory Birds Treaty act in the U.S. It is endangered in Illinois and Wisconsin while being of special concern in Michigan and Minnesota. Preservation of wetlands and introduction of artificial nesting sites may help preserve the species in high-risk areas ().

Increasing populations of carp in drainage systems, causing damage to marsh vegetation, may limit habitat availability for Forster&#x27;s tern. There have also been anecdotal reports of intense spawning activity of carp damaging tern&#x27;s floating nests.

As with many species of piscivorous birds, Forster&#x27;s tern is susceptible to bioaccumulation of pollutants. High mercury concentrations may induce biochemical stress, reducing the overall health of terns. Biomethylation of mercury is increased in marshes and salt ponds, hence increasing the susceptibility of the Forster&#x27;s tern. High levels of selenium may also have deleterious effects on their health. Organochlorine contaminants such as PCBs may also diminish their breeding success.

<text>Sterna is a genus of terns in the bird family Laridae. The genus used to encompass most &quot;white&quot; terns indiscriminately, but mtDNA sequence comparisons have determined that this arrangement was paraphyletic. It is now restricted to the typical medium-sized white terns with deeply forked tails, which occur near-globally, mostly in coastal regions but several also using freshwater habitats inland.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Sterna&quot; was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The type species is the common tern (&quot;Sterna hirundo&quot;). &quot;Sterna&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;stearn&quot; which appears in the poem &quot;The Seafarer&quot;; a similar word was used to refer to terns by the Frisians.

===Species===
The genus contains 13 species.

The following genera were formerly often included in &quot;Sterna&quot;:
*&quot;Onychoprion&quot; (larger terns with white foreheads and dark backs)
*&quot;Sternula&quot; (small terns mostly with white foreheads)
*&quot;Thalasseus&quot; (large terns with crests)

<doc id="390367" wikidata="Q350669" url="?curid=390367" title="Adam Kadmon">
<text>In Kabbalah, Adam Kadmon (, &quot;ʾāḏām qaḏmōn&quot;, &quot;Primordial Man&quot;) also called Adam Elyon (, &quot;ʾāḏām ʿelyōn&quot;, &quot;Most High Man&quot;), or Adam Ila&#x27;ah (, &quot;ʾāḏām ʿīllāʾā&quot; &quot;Supreme Man&quot;), sometimes abbreviated as A&quot;K (, &quot;ʾA.Q.&quot;), is the first of Four Worlds that came into being after the contraction of God&#x27;s infinite light. &quot;Adam Kadmon&quot; is not the same as the physical &quot;Adam Ha-Rishon&quot; (אָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן).

In Lurianic Kabbalah, the description of &quot;Adam Kadmon&quot; is anthropomorphic. Nonetheless, &quot;Adam Kadmon&quot; is divine light without vessels, i.e., pure potential. In the human psyche, &quot;Adam Kadmon&quot; corresponds to the yechidah, the collective essence of the soul.

==In Judaism==

===Philo===
The first to use the expression &quot;original man,&quot; or &quot;heavenly man,&quot; was Philo, in whose view the , or , &quot;as being born in the image of God, has no participation in any corruptible or earthlike essence; whereas the earthly man is made of loose material, called a lump of clay.&quot; The heavenly man, as the perfect image of the &quot;Logos&quot;, is neither man nor woman, but an incorporeal intelligence purely an idea; while the earthly man, who was created by God later, is perceptible to the senses and partakes of earthly qualities. Philo is evidently combining philosophy and Midrash, Plato and the rabbis. 

Setting out from the duplicate biblical account of Adam, who was formed in the image of God (), and of the first man, whose body God formed from the earth (), he combines with it the Platonic theory of forms; taking the primordial Adam as the idea, and the created man of flesh and blood as the &quot;image.&quot; That Philo&#x27;s philosophic views are grounded on the Midrash, and not vice versa, is evident from his seemingly senseless statement that the &quot;heavenly man,&quot; the οὐράνιος ἄνθρωπος (who is merely an idea), is &quot;neither man nor woman.&quot; This doctrine, however, becomes quite intelligible in view of the following ancient Midrash.

===Midrash===
The remarkable contradiction between Genesis 1:27 and Genesis 2:7 could not escape the attention of the Pharisees, for whom the Bible was a subject of close study. In explaining the various views concerning Eve&#x27;s creation, they taught that Adam was created as a man-woman (androgynos), explaining &quot;&quot; () as &quot;male and female&quot; instead of &quot;man and woman,&quot; and that the separation of the sexes arose from the subsequent operation upon Adam&#x27;s body, as related in the Scripture. This explains Philo&#x27;s statement that the original man was neither man nor woman.

This doctrine concerning the Logos, as also that of man made &quot;in the likeness,&quot; although tinged with true Philonic coloring, is also based on the theology of the Pharisees. Genesis Rabbah:

This contains the kernel of Philo&#x27;s philosophical doctrine of the creation of the original man. He calls him the idea of the earthly Adam, while with the rabbis the spirit () of Adam not only existed before the creation of the earthly Adam, but was preexistent to the whole of creation. From the preexisting Adam, or Messiah, to the Logos is merely a step.

===Kabbalah===
In Kabbalah, before creation began, all that existed was God&#x27;s Infinite Light. The first stage of creation began when God contracted His Infinite Light to create the vacuum. Then a ray of divine light penetrated the vacuum and the persona of Adam Kadmon was projected into the vacuum. The first stage of Adam Kadmon was in the form of ten concentric circles (&quot;igulim&quot;), which emanated from the ray. The ray of light was then enclothed by the anthropomorphic form of Adam Kadmon (), which is a realm of infinite divine light without vessels, constrained by its potential to create future Existence. Adam Kadmon is sometimes referred to as &quot;Adam Ila&#x27;a&quot; (Aramaic: &quot;upper man&quot;) or &quot;Adam Elyon&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;upper man&quot;).

The soul of Adam HaRishon (&quot;the first man&quot;) was the supreme essence of mankind. It contained within it all subsequent souls. In the midrash, he is sometimes referred to as &quot;Adam HaKadmoni&quot; (&quot;the ancient man&quot;), &quot;Adam Tata&#x27;a&quot; (Aramaic: &quot;lower man&quot;) or &quot;Adam Tachton&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;lower man&quot;).

The anthropomorphic name of Adam Kadmon denotes that it contains both the ultimate divine purpose for creation, i.e., mankind, as well as an embodiment of the Sefirot (divine attributes). Adam Kadmon is paradoxically both &quot;Adam&quot; and divine (&quot;Kadmon-Primary&quot;).

Adam Kadmon preceded the manifestation of the Four Worlds, Atzilut (&quot;emanation&quot;), Beriah (&quot;creation&quot;), Yetzirah (&quot;formation&quot;) and Asiyah (&quot;action&quot;). Whereas each of the Four Worlds is represented by one letter of the divine four-lettered name of God, Adam Kadmon is represented by the transcendental cusp of the first letter Yud.

In the system of the sefirot, Adam Kadmon corresponds to Keter (&quot;crown&quot;), the divine will that motivated creation.

The two versions of Kabbalistic theosophy, the &quot;medieval/classic/Zoharic&quot; (systemised by Moshe Cordovero) and the more comprehensive Lurianic, describe the process of descending worlds differently. For Cordovero, the sefirot, Adam Kadmon and the Four Worlds evolve sequentially from the Ein Sof (divine infinity). For Luria, creation is a dynamic process of divine exile-rectification enclothement, where Adam Kadmon is preceded by the Tzimtzum (Divine &quot;contraction&quot;) and followed by Shevira (the &quot;shattering&quot; of the sefirot).

Closely related to the Philonic doctrine of the heavenly Adam is the Adam Ḳadmon (called also Adam &#x27;Ilaya, the &quot;high man,&quot; the &quot;heavenly man&quot;) of the Zohar, whose conception of the original man can be deduced from the following passages: &quot;The form of man is the image of everything that is above [in heaven] and below [upon earth]; therefore did the Holy Ancient [God] select it for His own form.&quot;

As with Philo the Logos is the original image of man, or the original man, so in the Zohar the heavenly man is the embodiment of all divine manifestations: the ten Sefirot, the original image of man. The heavenly Adam, stepping forth out of the highest original darkness, created the earthly Adam. In other words, the activity of the original essence manifested itself in the creation of man, who at the same time is the image of the heavenly man and of the universe, just as with Plato and Philo the idea of man, as microcosm, embraces the idea of the universe or macrocosm.

The conception of Adam Ḳadmon becomes an important factor in the later Kabbalah of Isaac Luria. Adam Ḳadmon is with him no longer the concentrated manifestation of the Sefirot, but a mediator between the En-Sof (&quot;infinite&quot;) and the Sefirot. The En-Sof, according to Luria, is so utterly incomprehensible that the older Kabbalistic doctrine of the manifestation of the En-Sof in the Sefirot must be abandoned. Hence he teaches that only the Adam Ḳadmon, who arose in the way of self-limitation by the En-Sof, can be said to manifest himself in the Sefirot. This theory of Luria is treated by Ḥayyim Vital in &quot;&#x27;Eẓ Ḥayyim; Derush &#x27;Agulim we-Yosher&quot; (Treatise on Circles and the Straight Line).

==Gnosticism==
The Primeval Man (&quot;Protanthropos&quot;, Adam) occupies a prominent place in several Gnostic systems. In the Coptic Nag Hammadi texts, the archetypical Adam is known as Pigeradamas or Geradamas. According to Irenaeus the Aeon Autogenes emits the true and perfect Anthrôpos, also called Adamas; he has a helpmate, &quot;Perfect Knowledge&quot;, and receives an irresistible force, so that all things rest in him. Others say there is a blessed and incorruptible and endless light in the power of Bythos; this is the Father of all things who is invoked as the First Man, who, with his Ennoia, emits &quot;the Son of Man&quot;, or Euteranthrôpos.

According to Valentinus, Adam was created in the name of Anthrôpos and overawes the demons by the fear of the pre-existent man (&quot;&quot;). In the Valentinian syzygies and in the Marcosian system, we meet in the fourth (originally the third) place Anthrôpos and Ecclesia.

In the &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;, the Aeon Jeu is called the First Man, he is the overseer of the Light, messenger of the First Precept, and constitutes the forces of the Heimarmene. In the &quot;Books of Jeu&quot; this &quot;great Man&quot; is the King of the Light-treasure, he is enthroned above all things and is the goal of all souls.

According to the Naassenes, the Protanthropos is the first element; the fundamental being before its differentiation into individuals. &quot;The Son of Man&quot; is the same being after it has been individualized into existing things and thus sunk into matter.

The Gnostic Anthrôpos, therefore, or &quot;Adamas&quot;, as it is sometimes called, is a cosmogonic element, pure mind as distinct from matter, mind conceived hypostatically as emanating from God and not yet darkened by contact with matter. This mind is considered as the reason of humanity, or humanity itself, as a personified idea, a category without corporeality, the human reason conceived as the World-Soul. The same idea, somewhat modified, occurs in Hermetic literature, especially the &quot;Poimandres&quot;.

==In Manichaeism==
A portion of these Gnostic teachings, when combined with Zoroastrianism, furnished Mani with his particular doctrine of the original man. He even retains the Jewish designations &quot;Adam Kadmon&quot; (= ) and &quot;Nakhash Kadmon&quot; (= ), as may be seen in &quot;Al-Fihrist&quot;. But, according to Mani, the original man is fundamentally distinct from the first father of the human race. He is a creation of the King of Light, and is therefore endowed with five elements of the kingdom of light; whereas Adam really owes his existence to the kingdom of darkness, and only escapes belonging altogether to the number of demons through the fact that he bears the likeness of the original man in the elements of light contained within him. The Gnostic doctrine of the identity of Adam, as the original man, with the Messiah appears in Mani in his teaching of the &quot;Redeeming Christ,&quot; who has his abode in the sun and moon, but is identical with the original man. It also appears in this theory that Adam was the first of the sevenfold series of true prophets, comprising Adam, Seth, Noah, Abraham, Zoroaster, Buddha, and Jesus. The stepping-stone from the Gnostic original man to Manichaeism was probably the older Mandaean conception, which may have exercised great influence. Of this conception, however, there remains in the later Mandaean writings little more than the expression &quot;Gabra Ḳadmaya&quot; (Adam Ḳadmon).

==In Mandaeism==

&quot;Adam Kasia&quot;, also referred to using the portmanteau &quot;Adakas&quot; in the &quot;Ginza Rabba&quot;, means &quot;the hidden Adam&quot; in Mandaic. The hidden Adam is also called &quot;Adam Qadmaiia&quot; (&quot;First Adam&quot;) or &quot;Gabra Qadmaiia &quot; (&quot;First Man&quot;). In Mandaeism, it means the soul of the first man and the soul of every human. &quot;Adam Kasia&quot; shows many similarities with the Jewish idea of Adam Kadmon.

==In other traditions==

Outside of an Abrahamic context, the Cosmic Man is also an archetypical figure that appears in creation myths of a wide variety of cultures. Generally he is described as bestowing life upon all things, and is also frequently the physical basis of the world, such that after death parts of his body became physical parts of the universe. He also represents the oneness of human existence, or the universe.

For instance, in the Purusha sukta of the Rigveda, Purusha (Sanskrit &quot;, &quot;पुरुष &quot;man,&quot; or &quot;Cosmic Man&quot;) is sacrificed by the devas from the foundation of the world—his mind is the Moon, his eyes are the Sun, and his breath is the wind. He is described as having a thousand heads and a thousand feet.

==In popular culture==
One tradition associates Adam Kadmon or the biblical Adam and the figure of Cadmus in Greek mythology, both associated with dragons/serpents.

The Marvel Comics character Eternity has called himself Adam Qadmon.

In &quot;Persona 5 Royal&quot;, the ultimate Persona of the antagonist Takuto Maruki is named Adam Kadmon.

<text>Roman usurpers were individuals or groups of individuals who obtained or tried to obtain power by force and without legitimate legal authority. Usurpation was endemic during the Roman imperial era, especially from the crisis of the third century onwards, when political instability became the rule.

==Instability==
The first dynasty of the Roman Empire, the Julio-Claudian dynasty (27 BC – 68 AD), justified the imperial throne with familial ties through adoption. However, conflicts within the family led to the demise of the line. Nero committed suicide in 68 as an enemy of the people, resulting in a brief civil war. The Flavian dynasty started with Vespasian, only to end with the assassination of his second son, Domitian. Throughout most of the 2nd century, the empire enjoyed relative stability under the rule of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty, but the next century would be characterised by endemic political instability, one of the factors that eventually contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

Commodus, the last emperor of the Nerva–Antonine dynasty, was remembered by contemporaneous chronicles as an unpopular ruler notorious for his extravagance and cruelty, and he was assassinated in 192. Without sons to be his heir, a struggle for power immediately broke out among the governors of the most important provinces. Pertinax was elevated to the purple and recognized by his peers, but after his murder by a restive Praetorian Guard, Septimius Severus decided to make his bid for power and usurped the throne. Although initially a usurper, Severus managed to remain in power for the next 18 years and died a natural death while he was campaigning in northern Britain. The 235 death of Severus Alexander, the last emperor of the Severan dynasty, triggered what historians call the Crisis of the Third Century. From 235 to the accession of Diocletian and the establishment of the Tetrarchy in 286, Rome saw 28 emperors, only two of whom had a natural death (from the plague). However, there were also 38 usurpers who raised revolts across the empire, a clear sign that the security of the frontiers was not the only problem within the Roman world. Usurpation attempts were a constant worry for the emperors in this period since it was a too-common method of acceding the throne. Successful usurpers were usually provincial governors; commanders of a large grouping of Roman legions; or prefects of the Praetorian Guard, which had control of Rome, where the imperial palace still lay.

The danger of usurpation was greater after the death of an emperor when his successor was not accepted by all provinces. Usually, the legions acclaimed their own commander as emperor on news of the accession of a less popular man. The acclaimed emperor, usually a provincial governor, would then march to Italy or where the opponent was stationed to contest for the purple. However, since legionaries disliked fighting against their brothers in arms, battles between legions rarely transpired. Two main factors decided the success of a usurpation attempt: the loyalty of the legionaries, which were heavily dependent on the amount of booty or monetary prizes promised on victory, and the trust of the military abilities of the commander upon which depended morale. Failure of either part to fulfill one or two of the criteria normally resulted in a mutiny and the death at the hands of their own soldiers. Since the emperors had the &quot;status quo&quot; and political credibility behind them, the usurper had to be a charismatic man to avoid doubts in his ranks and an untimely death. Valerian I, who defeated Aemilianus, himself a usurper, is an example of that kind. Other usurpers, like Philip the Arab, became emperor by a planned murder directed at an established sovereign (in that case, Gordian III).

However successful, the usurpation procedure always left the new emperor in a somewhat fragile political position since the throne had been attained by violent means. The danger of another usurper was always present, and the first measures taken were inevitably to put trusted men into important commands. Frequently, the emperor embellished his ancestry and early life to enhance his credibility or the right to the throne. Mentions of obscure genealogical relations with previous popular emperors were common and certainly confused historians. However, most of all, the usurper maneuvered to keep his legions happy since he owed his power to their continued loyalty.

==Practical effects==

The usurpation mania of the 3rd century had profound effects in the empire&#x27;s bureaucratic and military organisation. Fear of potential rivals was to be the main driving force for the evolution of the Roman world from the early to the late Empire.

One of the most striking changes was the division and multiplication of the Roman provinces. Provinces were ruled by a governor, whether a proconsul, propraetor or procurator, and were ascribed a certain number of legions, according to the degree of pacification that they required. Thus, the governors of, for instance, Moesia or Pannonia in the Danubian border had huge military contingents on their hands. The greater the number of legions a provincial governor had, the greater the temptation to make a bid to the throne. And indeed, most usurpation attempts came from the Asian province of Syria, and the Rhine and Danube provinces, frontier provinces with large military presence. Thus, provinces were slowly divided into smaller units to avoid concentration of power and military capacity in the hands of one man. Syria is a perfect example: a single province in AD 14, it was in the mid-3rd century divided into four different administrative regions: Tres Daciae, Cappadocia, Syria Coele and Syria Palestina. Similarly, Moesia and Pannonia were divided into Superior and Inferior (Upper and Lower) halves; Dardania was later separated from Moesia and Pannonia was further divided into Prima, Valeria, Savia and Secunda.

As the fear of civil war increased, the emperor felt the need of legions permanently in his reach to be deployed against possible internal threats. That caused the geographic division of the army into &quot;limitanei&quot; legions, which remained in the borders, and &quot;comitatenses&quot;, which were stationed in strategic points within the empire. Legio II Parthica, which was garrisoned in the Alban mountains outside Rome from the time of Septimius Severus, was among the first &quot;comitatenses&quot; created.

Men had to be removed from the frontier garrisons to create the internal legions. A smaller number of border legions meant less-secure borders and eventually, raids from the Germanic and Gothic tribes against the Rhine and the Danube became more frequent. In the East, the Persian Empire grew bolder in its attacks on the Roman communities. Moreover, since individual initiative was a common way to assume the imperial purple, the giving of important commands to competent generals was asking for trouble. Jealousy and fear often prevented the presence of the right man to deal with a specific threat, and so marginal provinces were often raided, sacked or conquered.

==Assessment of usurpers==

The only usurpers whose early life and specific circumstances of rebellion are known with reasonable certainty are the ones who would become emperors. The unsuccessful usurpation attempts inevitably ended with the rebel&#x27;s execution, murder or suicide and the subsequent erasure of his life from all records. That often causes confusion in the contemporaneous sources that are contradictory in the details of a certain rebellion. For instance, the usurper Uranius is placed by some in the reign of Elagabalus and by others in the time of Gallienus.

Every new emperor, either legal or illegal, marked the beginning of his rule by minting new coins, both to have the prestige of declaring oneself as &quot;Augustus&quot; and to pay the loyal soldiers their share. Thus, coinage is often the only evidence of a determined usurpation, but the number of coin types with the effigy of a usurper might not be equal to the total number of usurpations. The presence of minting facilities certainly allowed short-term usurpers to release their coinage, but on the other hand, a man capable of sustaining a rebellion for a couple of months in a remote area might fail to produce his own coins by lack of access to the instruments of minting technology.

Later assessment of usurpations demonstrated that some are questionable or even fictitious. Gallienus was the emperor who suffered greatest number of usurpations, with a record of 14 attempts (excluding the Gallic Empire secession) in 15 years of rule. However, three of these are clear fabrications, either contemporaneous to show the invincibility of the emperor or added by later writers to embellish their own prose.

<doc id="390372" wikidata="Q117096" url="?curid=390372" title="Ramon Magsaysay">
<text>Ramon del Fierro Magsaysay Sr. (August 31, 1907 – March 17, 1957) was a Filipino statesman who served as the seventh President of the Philippines, from December 30, 1953 until his death in an aircraft disaster on March 17, 1957. An automobile mechanic by profession, Magsaysay was appointed military governor of Zambales after his outstanding service as a guerrilla leader during the Pacific War. He then served two terms as Liberal Party congressman for Zambales&#x27;s at-large district before being appointed Secretary of National Defense by President Elpidio Quirino. He was elected president under the banner of the Nacionalista Party. He was the youngest to be elected as president, and second youngest to be president (after Emilio Aguinaldo). He was the first Philippine president born in the 20th century and the first to be born after the Spanish colonial era.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Ramon del Fierro Magsaysay, of mixed Tagalog, Visayan, Spanish, and Chinese descent, 
was born in Iba, Zambales on August 31, 1907, to Exequiel de los Santos Magsaysay (April 18, 1874 in San Marcelino, Zambales – January 24, 1969 in Manila), a blacksmith, and Perfecta Quimson del Fierro (April 18, 1886 in Castillejos, Zambales – May 5, 1981 in Manila), a Chinese mestizo schoolteacher, nurse.

He spent his grade school life somewhere in Castillejos and his high school life at Zambales Academy in San Narciso, Zambales. After college, Magsaysay entered the University of the Philippines in 1927, where he enrolled in a Mechanical Engineering course. He first worked as a chauffeur to support himself as he studied engineering; and later, he transferred to the Institute of Commerce at José Rizal College (now José Rizal University) from 1928 to 1932, where he received a baccalaureate in commerce. He then worked as an automobile mechanic for a bus company and shop superintendent.

=== Career during World War II ===

At the outbreak of World War II, he joined the motor pool of the 31st Infantry Division of the Philippine Army. 

When Bataan surrendered in 1942, Magsaysay escaped to the hills, narrowly evading Japanese arrest on at least four occasions. There he organised the Western Luzon Guerrilla Forces, and was commissioned captain on April 5, 1942. For three years, Magsaysay operated under Col. Frank Merrill&#x27;s famed guerrilla outfit and saw action at Sawang, San Marcelino, Zambales, first as a supply officer codenamed &quot;Chow&quot; and later as commander of a 10,000-strong force. 

Magsaysay was among those instrumental in clearing the Zambales coast of the Japanese prior to the landing of American forces together with the Philippine Commonwealth troops on January 29, 1945.

===Family===
He was married to Luz Rosauro Banzon on June 16, 1933, and they had three children: Teresita (1934–1979), Milagros (b. 1936) and Ramon Jr. (b. 1938).

Other Relatives

Several of Magsaysay&#x27;s relatives became prominent public figures in their own right:
*Ramon &quot;Jun&quot; Banzon Magsaysay Jr., son; former Congressman and Senator
*Francisco &quot;Paco&quot; Delgado Magsaysay, entrepreneur
*Genaro Magsaysay, brother; former Senator
*Vicente Magsaysay, nephew; Former Governor of Zambales
*JB Magsaysay, grandnephew; actor, politician, and businessman
*Antonio M. Diaz, nephew; Congressman and Assemblyman of Zambales
*Anita Magsaysay-Ho, cousin; painter

===House of Representatives (1945–1950)===
On April 22, 1946, Magsaysay, encouraged by his fellow ex-guerrillas, was elected under the Liberal Party to the Philippine House of Representatives. In 1948, President Manuel Roxas chose Magsaysay to go to Washington, D.C. as Chairman of the Committee on Guerrilla Affairs, to help to secure passage of the Rogers Veterans Bill, giving benefits to Philippine veterans. In the so-called &quot;dirty election&quot; of 1949, he was re-elected to a second term in the House of Representatives. During both terms, he was Chairman of the House National Defense Committee.

===Secretary of National Defense (1950–1953)===
In early August 1950, he offered President Elpidio Quirino a plan to fight the Communist guerrillas, using his own experiences in guerrilla warfare during World War II. After some hesitation, Quirino realized that there was no alternative and appointed Magsaysay Secretary of National Defence in September 1950. He intensified the campaign against the Hukbalahap guerrillas. This success was due in part to the unconventional methods he took up from a former advertising expert and CIA agent, Colonel Edward Lansdale. In the counterinsurgency the two utilized deployed soldiers distributing relief goods and other forms of aid to outlying, provincial communities. Prior to Magsaysay&#x27;s appointment as Defense Secretary, rural citizens perceived the Philippine Army with apathy and distrust. However, Magsaysay&#x27;s term enhanced the Army&#x27;s image, earning them respect and admiration.

In June 1952, Magsaysay made a goodwill tour to the United States and Mexico. He visited New York, Washington, D.C. (with a medical check-up at Walter Reed Hospital) and Mexico City, where he spoke at the Annual Convention of Lions International.

By 1953, President Quirino thought the threat of the Huks was under control and Secretary Magsaysay was becoming too weak. Magsaysay met with interference and obstruction from the President and his advisers, in fears they might be unseated at the next presidential election. Although Magsaysay had at that time no intention to run, he was urged from many sides and finally was convinced that the only way to continue his fight against communism, and for a government for the people, was to be elected president, ousting the corrupt administration that, in his opinion, had caused the rise of the communist guerrillas by bad administration. He resigned his post as defense secretary on February 28, 1953, and became the presidential candidate of the Nacionalista Party, disputing the nomination with Senator Camilo Osías at the Nacionalista national convention.

====1951 Padilla incident====
 When news reached Magsaysay that his political ally Moises Padilla was being tortured by men of provincial governor Rafael Lacson, he rushed to Negros Occidental, but was too late. He was then informed that Padilla&#x27;s body was drenched in blood, pierced by fourteen bullets, and was positioned on a police bench in the town plaza. Magsaysay himself carried Padilla&#x27;s corpse with his bare hands and delivered it to the morgue, and the next day, news clips showed pictures of him doing so. Magsaysay even used this event during his presidential campaign in 1953.

The trial against Lacson started in January 1952; Magsaysay and his men presented enough evidence to convict Lacson and his 26 men for murder. In August 1954, Judge Eduardo Enríquez ruled the men were guilty and Lacson, his 25 men and three other mayors of Negros Occidental municipalities were condemned to the electric chair.

===Manila Railroad leadership===
Magsaysay was also the general manager of the Manila Railroad Company between October and December 1951. His tenure later motivated him to modernize the rail operator&#x27;s fleet after stepping into presidency. He also set the first steps in building what has been the discontinued Cagayan Valley Railroad Extension project.

===1953 presidential campaign===

Presidential elections were held on November 10, 1953, in the Philippines. Incumbent President Elpidio Quirino lost his opportunity for a second full term as President of the Philippines to former Defense Secretary Magsaysay. His running mate, Senator José Yulo lost to Senator Carlos P. García. Vice President Fernando López did not run for re-election. This was the first time that an elected Philippine President did not come from the Senate. Moreover, Magsaysay began the practice in the Philippines of &quot;campaign jingles&quot; during elections, for one of his inclinations and hobbies was dancing. The jingles that were used during the election period was &quot;Mambo Magsaysay&quot;&quot;, &quot;We Want Magsaysay&quot;, and &quot;The Magsaysay Mambo&quot;

The United States Government, including the Central Intelligence Agency, had strong influence on the 1953 election, and candidates in the election fiercely competed with each other for U.S. support.

== Presidency (1953–1957) ==
In the election of 1953, Magsaysay was decisively elected president over the incumbent Elpidio Quirino. He was sworn into office on Wednesday, December 30, 1953, at the Independence Grandstand in Manila. He was wearing the barong tagalog, a first by a Philippine President and a tradition that still continues up to this day. He was then called &quot;Mambo Magsaysay&quot;. Also dressed in barong tagalog was the elected vice-president Carlos P. Garcia. The oath of office was administered by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines Ricardo Paras. For the first time, a Philippine president swore on the Bible on an inauguration. He swore on two Bibles, from each parents&#x27; side.

As President, he was a close friend and supporter of the United States and a vocal spokesman against communism during the Cold War. He led the foundation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, also known as the Manila Pact of 1954, that aimed to defeat communist-Marxist movements in Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Southwestern Pacific.

During his term, he made Malacañang literally a &quot;house of the people&quot;, opening its gates to the public. One example of his integrity followed a demonstration flight aboard a new plane belonging to the Philippine Air Force (PAF): President Magsaysay asked what the operating costs per hour were for that type of aircraft, then wrote a personal check to the PAF, covering the cost of his flight. He restored the people&#x27;s trust in the military and in the government.

=== Administration and cabinet ===
===Domestic policies===
====Presidential Inauguration Day====
Ushering a new era in Philippine government, President Magsaysay placed emphasis upon service to the people by bringing the government closer to the former. 

This was symbolically seen when, on inauguration day, President Magsaysay ordered the gates of Malacañan Palace be opened to the general public, who were allowed to freely visit all parts of the Palace complex. Later, this was regulated to allow weekly visitation.

True to his electoral promise, he 
created the Presidential Complaints and Action Committee. This body immediately proceeded to hear grievances and recommend remedial action. Headed by soft-spoken, but active and tireless, Manuel Manahan, this committee would come to hear nearly 60,000 complaints in a year, of which more than 30,000 would be settled by direct action and a little more than 25,000 would be referred to government agencies for appropriate follow-up. This new entity, composed of youthful personnel, all loyal to the President, proved to be a highly successful morale booster restoring the people&#x27;s confidence in their own government. He appointed Zotico &quot;Tex&quot; Paderanga Carrillo in 1953 as PCAC Chief for Mindanao and Sulu. He became a close friend to the president because of his charisma to the common people of Mindanao.

Zotico was a local journalist and a writer from a family on Camiguin, (then sub-province of Misamis Oriental), Zotico become a depository of complaints and an eye of the president in the region his diplomatic skills helped the government, moro and the rebels to learn the true situation in every city and municipalities. With his zero corruption mandate he recognized a turn of achievement of Zotico that made him his &quot;compadre&quot; when Zotico named his fifth child after the President when he was elected in 1953, even making the President godfather to the boy. Magsaysay personally visited Mindanao several times because of this friendship, becoming the first President to visit Camiguin, where he was warmly received by thousands of people who waited for his arrival.

====Agrarian reform====
To amplify and stabilize the functions of the Economic Development Corps (EDCOR), President Magsaysay worked for the establishment of the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA). This body took over from the EDCOR and helped in the giving some sixty-five thousand acres to three thousand indigent families for settlement purposes. Again, it allocated some other twenty-five thousand to a little more than one thousand five hundred landless families, who subsequently became farmers.

As further aid to the rural people, the president established the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA). The idea was for this entity to make available rural credits. Records show that it did grant, in this wise, almost ten million dollars. This administration body next devoted its attention to cooperative marketing.

Along this line of help to the rural areas, President Magsaysay initiated in all earnestness the artesian wells campaign. A group-movement known as the Liberty Wells Association was formed and in record time managed to raise a considerable sum for the construction of as many artesian wells as possible. The socio-economic value of the same could not be gainsaid and the people were profuse in their gratitude.

Finally, vast irrigation projects, as well as enhancement of the Ambuklao Power plant and other similar ones, went a long way towards bringing to reality the rural improvement program advocated by President Magsaysay.

President Magsaysay enacted the following laws as part of his Agrarian Reform Program:
* Republic Act No. 1160 of 1954 – Abolished the LASEDECO and established the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) to resettle dissidents and landless farmers. It was particularly aimed at rebel returnees providing home lots and farmlands in Palawan and Mindanao.
* Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act of 1954) – governed the relationship between landowners and tenant farmers by organizing share-tenancy and leasehold system. The law provided the security of tenure of tenants. It also created the Court of Agrarian Relations.
* Republic Act No. 1400 (Land Reform Act of 1955) – Created the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) which was responsible for the acquisition and distribution of large tenanted rice and corn lands over 200 hectares for individuals and 600 hectares for corporations.
* Republic Act No. 821 (Creation of Agricultural Credit Cooperative Financing Administration) – Provided small farmers and share tenants loans with low interest rates of six to eight percent.

====Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon====
In early 1954, Benigno Aquino Jr. was appointed by President Magsaysay to act as his personal emissary to Luis Taruc, leader of the rebel group, Hukbalahap. Also in 1954, Lt. Col. Laureño Maraña, the former head of Force X of the 16th PC Company, assumed command of the 7th BCT, which had become one of the most mobile striking forces of the Philippine ground forces against the Huks, from Colonel Valeriano. Force X employed psychological warfare through combat intelligence and infiltration that relied on secrecy in planning, training, and execution of attack. The lessons learned from Force X and Nenita were combined in the 7th BCT.

With the all out anti-dissidence campaigns against the Huks, they numbered less than 2,000 by 1954 and without the protection and support of local supporters, active Huk resistance no longer presented a serious threat to Philippine security. From February to mid-September 1954, the largest anti-Huk operation, &quot;Operation Thunder-Lightning&quot; was conducted that resulted in Taruc&#x27;s surrender on May 17. Further cleanup operations of the remaining guerrillas lasted throughout 1955, cutting their number to less than 1,000 by year&#x27;s end.

===Foreign policies===
====Southeast Asia Treaty Organization====
The administration of President Magsaysay was active in the fight against the expansion of communism in Asia. He made the Philippines a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), which was established in Manila on September 8, 1954, during the &quot;Manila Conference&quot;. Members of SEATO were alarmed at the possible victory of North Vietnam over South Vietnam, which could spread communist ideology to other countries in the region. The possibility that a communist state can influence or cause other countries to adopt the same system of government is called the domino theory.

The active coordination of the Magsaysay administration with the Japanese government led to the Reparation Agreement. This was an agreement between the two countries, obligating the Japanese government to pay $550 million as reparation for war damages to the Philippines.

The SEATO agreement have proved to be unpopular among the Philippines&#x27; Asian neighbors, having its original members were the U.S., France, the U.K., Australia, Pakistan and New Zealand, with the U.S. as its driving force. His support for South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem became unpopular to the Vietnamese public especially those in the north. Magsaysay also pressured Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk for Cambodia to join SEATO and claimed that the prince was violating Cambodia&#x27;s non-alignment policy.

====Defense Council====
Taking the advantage of the presence of U.S. Secretary John Foster Dulles in Manila to attend the SEATO Conference, the Philippine government took steps to broach with him the establishment of a Joint Defense Council. Vice-President and Secretary of Foreign Affairs Carlos P. Garcia held the opportune conversations with Secretary Dulles for this purpose. Agreement was reached thereon and the first meeting of the Joint United States–Philippines Defense Council was held in Manila following the end of the Manila Conference. Thus were the terms of the Mutual Defense Pact between the Philippines and the United States duly implemented.

====Laurel-Langley Agreement====

Under Magsaysay’s leadership, Filipino nationalists addressed the killing of Filipinos who were crossing the perimeter of American military bases and growing anger over the Bell Trade Act. Negotiations with the United States led to the revision of these agreements, resulting in the Laurel-Langley Agreement signed in December 1954 by Senator Jose P. Laurel and James Langley. This agreement ended American control over Philippine currency and allowed more business opportunities for Filipino businessmen. The agreement expired in 1974. Although it proved deficient, the final agreement satisfied nearly all of the diverse Filipino economic interests. While some have seen the Laurel-Langley agreement as a continuation of the 1946 trade act, Jose P. Laurel and other Philippine leaders recognized that the agreement substantially gave the country greater freedom to industrialize while continuing to receive privileged access to US markets.

The agreement replaced the unpopular Bell Trade Act, which tied the economy of the Philippines to that of United States.

====Bandung Conference====
The culmination of a series of meetings to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or neocolonialism by either the United States or the Soviet Union in the Cold War, or any other imperialistic nations, the Asian–African Conference was held in Bandung, Indonesia in April 1955, upon invitation extended by the Prime Ministers of India, Pakistan, Burma, Ceylon, and Indonesia. This summit is commonly known as the Bandung Conference. Although, at first, the Magsaysay Government seemed reluctant to send any delegation. Later, however, upon advise of Ambassador Carlos P. Rómulo, it was decided to have the Philippines participate in the conference. Rómulo was asked to head the Philippine delegation. At the very outset indications were to the effect that the conference would promote the cause of neutralism as a third position in the current Cold War between the capitalist bloc and the communist group. John Kotelawala, Prime Minister of Ceylon, however, broke the ice against neutralism. He was immediately joined by Rómulo, who categorically stated that his delegation believed that &quot;a puppet is a puppet&quot;, no matter whether under a Western Power or an Asian state.

In the course of the conference, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru acidly spoke against the SEATO. Ambassador Rómulo delivered a stinging, eloquent retort that prompted Prime Minister Nehru to publicly apologize to the Philippine delegation. According to their account, the Philippine delegation ably represented the interests of the Philippines and, in the ultimate analysis, succeeded in turning the Bandung Conference into a victory against the plans of its socialist and neutralist delegates. However according to the final communique of the conference, communism as a threat in Asia was not mentioned. Instead, participating countries viewed that colonialism, racialism, cultural suppression, discrimination, and nuclear weapons as regional threats. Solutions offered by the conference for these threats were less ideological, which namely includes:

====Reparation agreement====
Following the reservations made by Ambassador Rómulo, on the Philippines&#x27; behalf, upon signing the Japanese Peace Treaty in San Francisco on September 8, 1951, for several years of series of negotiations were conducted by the Philippine government and that of Japan. In the face of adamant claims of the Japanese government that it found impossible to meet the demand for the payment of eight billion dollars by the way of reparations, President Magsaysay, during a so-called &quot;cooling off&quot; period, sent a Philippine Reparations Survey Committee, headed by Finance Secretary Jaime Hernandez, to Japan for an &quot;on the spot&quot; study of that country&#x27;s possibilities.
When the Committee reported that Japan was in a position to pay, Ambassador Felino Neri, appointed chief negotiator, went to Tokyo. On May 31, 1955, Ambassador Neri reached a compromise agreement with Japanese Minister Takazaki, the main terms of which consisted in the following: The Japanese government would pay eight hundred million dollars as reparations. Payment was to be made in this wise: Twenty million dollars would be paid in cash in Philippine currency; thirty million dollars, in services; five million dollars, in capital goods; and two hundred and fifty million dollars, in long-term industrial loans.

On August 12, 1955, President Magsaysay informed the Japanese government, through Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama, that the Philippines accepted the Neri-Takazaki agreement. In view of political developments in Japan, the Japanese Prime Minister could only inform the Philippine government of the Japanese acceptance of said agreement on March 15, 1956. The official Reparations agreement between the two government was finally signed at Malacañang Palace on May 9, 1956, thus bringing to a rather satisfactory conclusion this long drawn controversy between the two countries.

=== Controversies ===

==== &quot;Consecration&quot; of the Philippines to Sacred Heart ====
In December 2, 1956, during the Second National Eucharistic Congress in Manila, President Ramon Magsaysay publicly consecrated the Philippines to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was initially planned since November of the same year. This act was a reiteration of a similar dedication made by then-Vice President Fernando Lopez in 1950. Magsaysay&#x27;s decision, however, ignited significant controversy and opposition. Protestant groups, including the Philippine Federation of Christian Churches, voiced strong objections, arguing that the consecration favored a particular religion and violated the constitutional principle of separation of church and state. Dr. Gumersindo Garcia, a regent of the University of the Philippines, was notably vocal, stating that the president should not endorse any specific church, as it undermines the religious diversity of the nation.

Supporters of Magsaysay, such as Senator Soc Rodrigo and Raul Manglapus, defended his actions by asserting that he was acting in a personal capacity, exercising his individual religious freedom. Despite these defenses, the act intensified debates about the role of religion in government affairs. Organizations like &quot;The Spirit of 1896,&quot; dedicated to upholding individual rights and the separation of church and state, expressed doubts about the constitutionality of the consecration. 

==Death==
Magsaysay&#x27;s term, which was to end on December 30, 1957, was cut short by a plane crash. On March 16, 1957, Magsaysay left Manila for Cebu City where he spoke at a convention of USAFFE veterans and the commencement exercises of three educational institutions, namely: University of the Visayas, Southwestern Colleges, and the University of San Carlos. At the University of the Visayas, he was conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws. That same night, at about 1:00 am PST, he boarded the presidential plane &quot;Mt. Pinatubo&quot;, a C-47, heading back to Manila. In the early morning hours of March 17, the plane was reported missing. By late afternoon, newspapers had reported the airplane had crashed on Mount Manunggal in Cebu, and that 36 of the 56 aboard were killed. The actual number on board was 25, including Magsaysay. He was only 49. Only newspaperman Nestor Mata survived. Vice President Carlos P. Garcia, who was on an official visit to Australia at the time, returned to Manila and acceded to the presidency to serve out the remaining eight months of Magsaysay&#x27;s term.

An estimated two million people attended Magsaysay&#x27;s state funeral on March 22, 1957. He was posthumously referred to as the &quot;Champion of the Masses&quot; and &quot;Defender of Democracy&quot;. After his death, vice-president Carlos P. Garcia was inducted into the presidency on March 18, 1957, to complete the last eight months of Magsaysay&#x27;s term. In the presidential elections of 1957, Garcia won his four-year term as president, but his running mate was defeated.

==Legacy==

Magsaysay&#x27;s administration was considered as one of the cleanest and most corruption-free in modern Philippine history; his rule is often cited as the Philippines&#x27;s &quot;Golden Years&quot;. Trade and industry flourished, the Philippine military was at its prime, and the country gained international recognition in sports, culture, and foreign affairs. The Philippines placed second on a ranking of Asia&#x27;s clean and well-governed countries.

His presidency is seen as people-centered as government trust was high among the Filipino people, earning him the nickname &quot;Champion of the masses&quot; and his sympathetic approach to the Hukbalahap rebellion that the Huk rebels were not Communists; they were simple peasants who thought that rebellion was the only answer to their sufferings. He also gained nationwide support for his agrarian reforms on farmers and took action on government corruption that his administration inherited from prior administrations.

<text>The following is a list of usurpers in the [[Roman Empire]]. For an overview of the problem and consequences of usurpation, see [[Roman usurpers]]. In the Eastern Roman Empire (395–1453), rebellion and usurpation were so notoriously frequent (in the vision of the medieval West, where usurpation was rare) that the modern term &quot;byzantine&quot; became a byword for political intrigue and conspiracy. For usurpation in the Eastern Roman Empire, see [[List of Byzantine usurpers]].

==Usurpers who became legitimate emperors==
The following individuals began as usurpers, but became the legitimate emperor either by establishing uncontested control of the empire or by confirmation of their position by the Roman Senate or by the legitimate emperor.

===First Imperial civil war===

* Galba (68–69)
* Otho (69)
* Vitellius (69)
* Vespasian (69–79)

===Second Imperial civil war===

* Septimius Severus (193–211)
* Macrinus (217–218) in Syria, former prefect of the Praetorian Guard
* Elagabalus (218–222)

===Crisis of the Third Century===

* Maximinus Thrax (235–238) in the Rhine, former centurion
* Gordian I and Gordian II (238) in Africa, suicide after defeat in battle
* Philip the Arab (244–249) in the East, former prefect of the Praetorian Guard
* Decius (249–251)
* Trebonianus Gallus (251–253)
* Aemilianus (253)
* Valerian (253–260)

* Florianus (276)
* Probus (276–282)

===Western Empire===
Most Western emperors were accepted by the Roman Senate (possibly except for Constans II) but almost never recognized as colleagues by the Eastern Emperors. Three of them, (Constantine III, Priscus Attalus, and Constans II), reigned alongside the legitimate Emperor of the West Honorius, who accepted Constantine III as his co-emperor in 409. Upon his recognition, Constantine III appointed his son Constans II co-emperor.

* Majorian (457–461)
* Libius Severus (461–465)
* Olybrius (472)
* Glycerius (473–474)
* Romulus Augustulus (475–476)

==Usurpers not considered legitimate emperors==

The following individuals proclaimed themselves emperor (or were proclaimed or appointed as emperor), but are not considered as legitimate emperors because they did not oust the ruling emperor, or did not establish control of the whole empire, or were not accepted by the senate or other imperial colleagues.

They are listed here under the emperor whose rule they attempted to usurp. The noted date is the attempted year of usurpation.

<text>Ball State University (Ball State or BSU) is a public research university in Muncie, Indiana, United States. The university has three off-campus centers in Indianapolis, Fort Wayne, and Fishers, Indiana. The university is composed of seven academic colleges. As of 2023, the university enrolled about 20,400 students with 14,900 undergraduates and 5,500 graduate and doctoral students. The university offers about 120 undergraduate majors and 130 minor areas of study and more than 100 masters, doctoral, certificate, and specialist degrees.

In 1917, the Ball brothers, industrialists and founders of the Ball Corporation, acquired the foreclosed Indiana Normal Institute and gave the school and surrounding land to the State of Indiana. The Indiana General Assembly accepted the donation in the spring of 1918, with an initial 235 students enrolling at the Indiana State Normal School – Eastern Division on June 17, 1918. Ball State is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

Ball State athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are known as the Ball State Cardinals. The university is a member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC), competing at the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) Subdivision. Ball State&#x27;s volleyball program is a member of the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (MIVA). 

==History==
=== Predecessor schools ===
The location of today&#x27;s Ball State University had its start in 1899 as a private university called the Eastern Indiana Normal School. The entire school, including classrooms, a library, and the president&#x27;s residence were housed in what is today&#x27;s Frank A. Bracken Administration Building. The one-building school had a peak enrollment of 256 and charged $10 for a year&#x27;s tuition. It operated until the spring of 1901, when it was closed due to lack of funding. In 1902, the school reopened as Palmer University for the next three years when Francis Palmer, a retired Indiana banker, gave the school $100,000 as an endowment.

Between 1905 and 1907, the school dropped the Palmer name and operated as the Indiana Normal College. It had two divisions, the Normal School for educating teachers and the College of Applied Sciences. The school had an average enrollment of about 200 students. Due to diminishing enrollment and lack of funding, the school closed at the end of the 1906–1907 school year. In 1912, a group of local investors led by Michael Kelly reopened the school as the Indiana Normal Institute. To pay for updated materials and refurbishing the once-abandoned Administration Building, the school operated under a mortgage from the Muncie Trust Company. Although the school had its largest student body with a peak enrollment of 806, officials could not maintain mortgage payments, and the school was forced to close once again in June 1917 when the Muncie Trust Company initiated foreclosure proceedings.

=== The Ball brothers and Ball State Teachers College era (1917–1960) ===

On July 25, 1917, the Ball brothers, local industrialists and founders of the Ball Corporation, bought the Indiana Normal Institute from foreclosure. The Ball brothers also founded Ball Memorial Hospital and Minnetrista, and were the benefactors of Keuka College, founded by their uncle, George Harvey Ball. For $35,100, the Ball brothers bought the Administration Building and surrounding land. In early 1918, during the Indiana General Assembly&#x27;s short session, state legislators accepted the gift of the school and land by the Ball brothers. The state granted operating control of the Muncie campus and school buildings to the administrators of the Indiana State Normal School in Terre Haute. That same year, the Marion Normal Institute relocated to Muncie, adding its resources to what would officially be named the Indiana State Normal School – Eastern Division. An initial 235 students enrolled in 1918, with William W. Parsons serving as the first president of the university.

The close relationship between the Balls and the school led to an unofficial moniker for the college, with many students, faculty, and local politicians casually referring to the school as &quot;Ball State,&quot; a shorthand alternative to its longer, official name. During the 1922 short session of the Indiana legislature, the state renamed the school Ball Teachers College. This was in recognition of the Ball family&#x27;s continuing beneficence to the institution. During this act, the state also reorganized its relationship with Terre Haute and established a separate local board of trustees for the Muncie campus. In 1924, Ball Teachers College&#x27;s trustees hired Benjamin J. Burris as the successor to President Linnaeus N. Hines. The Ball brothers continued giving to the university and partially funded the construction of the Science Hall (now called Burkhardt Building) in 1924 and an addition to Ball Gymnasium in 1925. By the 1925–1926 school year, Ball State enrollment reached 991 students: 697 women and 294 men. Based on the school&#x27;s close relationship with the Ball Corporation, a long-running nickname for the school was &quot;Fruit Jar Tech.&quot;
During the regular legislative session of 1929, the General Assembly nominally separated the Terre Haute and Muncie campuses of the state teachers&#x27; college system, but it placed the governing of the Ball State campus under the Indiana State Teachers College Board of Trustees based in Terre Haute. With this action, the school was renamed Ball State Teachers College. The following year, enrollment increased to 1,118, with 747 female and 371 male students.

In 1935, the school added the Fine Arts Building for art, music, and dance instruction. Enrollment that year reached 1,151: 723 women and 428 men. As an expression of the many gifts from the Ball family since 1917, sculptor Daniel Chester French was commissioned by Muncie&#x27;s chamber of commerce to cast a bronze fountain figure to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Ball brothers&#x27; gift to the state. His creation, &quot;Beneficence,&quot; stands between the Administration Building and Lucina Hall where Talley Avenue ends at University Avenue.

Ball State, like the rest of the nation, was affected by the onset of World War II. There were several dramatic changes on Ball State&#x27;s campus during World War II. In 1939 Ball State began its Civilian Pilot Training program which had popular enrollment. This program allowed students and local resident to learn to fly, instructed by the Muncie Aviation Company. By the Fall of 1941 Ball State reached its peak enrollment to this point of 1,588 students. When the United States entered the war, Ball State like many other college campuses, saw a decline in male enrollment. At this time Ball State partnered with the United States military and established two training programs on campus, the Army Specialized Training Program and Navy V-1 Program. Each of these programs encouraged male enrollment in the college that also trained them to go on as pilots in the military service.

Ball State students and staff also contributed to the war effort by supporting the troops abroad. Students and staff led by Sherly DeMotte, a member of the English faculty, wrote dozens of letters to Ball State students and staff serving overseas. By 1943 a dozen students from Ball State had become war casualties. To bring awareness to their service, in 1943 the War Morale Committee dedicated the Roll of Honor; it listed the names of all those who served during the war.

=== Independent institution (1961–present) ===

In 1961, Ball State became independent of Indiana State University through the creation of the Ball State College Board of Trustees. The official name of the school was also changed to Ball State College. The Indiana General Assembly approved the development of a state-assisted architecture program, establishing the College of Architecture and Planning, which opened on March 23, 1965. The Center for Radio and Television (now named the College of Communication, Information, and Media) opened the following year, in 1966.

Recognizing the college&#x27;s expanding academic curriculum and growing enrollment (10,066 students), the General Assembly approved renaming the school to Ball State University in 1965. Most of the university&#x27;s largest residence halls were completed during this period of high growth, including the DeHority Complex (1960), Noyer Complex (1962), Studebaker Complex (1965), LaFollette Complex (1967), and Johnson Complex (1969). Academic and athletic buildings, including Irving Gymnasium (1962), Emens Auditorium (1964), Cooper Science Complex (1967), Scheumann Stadium (1967), Carmichael Hall (1969), Teachers College Building (1969), Pruis Hall (1972), and Bracken Library (1974), also expanded the university&#x27;s capacity and educational opportunities.

The university experienced another building boom beginning in the 2000s, with the openings of the Art and Journalism Building (2001), Shafer Tower (2001), the Music Instruction Building (2004), the David Letterman Communication and Media Building (2007), Park Hall (2007), Kinghorn Hall (2010), Marilyn K. Glick Center for Glass (2010), and the Student Recreation and Wellness Center (2010).

Under the university&#x27;s 14th president, Dr. Jo Ann Gora, over $520 million was committed to new construction and renovation projects throughout the Ball State campus. Within the last decade, Ball State University adopted Education Redefined as its motto, focusing on &quot;immersive learning&quot; to engage students across all academic programs in real-world projects. To date, there have been over 1,250 immersive learning projects, impacting residents in all of Indiana&#x27;s 92 counties under the mentoring of faculty from every academic department.

The university has also adopted environmental sustainability as a primary component of the university&#x27;s strategic plan and vision. Starting in the mid-2000s, all building additions and renovations are designed to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification standards. Ball State announced in 2009 that it would begin construction on the largest geothermal energy conversion project in U.S. history.

The university was defendant in the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;Vance v. Ball State University&quot;, which dealt with who can be regarded as a &quot;supervisor&quot; for harassment lawsuits. The case was argued on November 26, 2012. In a 5–4 decision, the court ruled in favor of Ball State.

In 2022, the final projects of the &quot;North Neighborhood&quot; were finished on the northern side of campus, where the LaFollette Complex once stood. The renovated residence halls included Botsford/Swinford (Johnson East) and Schmidt/Wilson (Johnson West). Jack Beyerl Hall, home of the STEM Living-Learning Community, and North West Hall, home of the Education and Design Living-Learning Communities were the two newly built residence halls adjacent to the new North Dining building. During construction, the former LaFollette Complex was demolished to make way for a new green space to be utilized by students and faculty with 10 pillars of Indiana limestone placed in the center in remembrance of the former residence hall.

== Campus ==
=== Main campus ===

Ball State&#x27;s main campus spans and includes 109 buildings at centered mostly on three main quadrangles. The university also manages just over of research property. The main campus is situated about northwest of downtown Muncie.

McKinley Ave. is a two-lane, primary north–south street through the Ball State campus. Streetscape features include landscaped medians, granite curbing, limestone bollards and planters, bus turn-outs, and brick crosswalks. A pedestrian scramble is located at the intersection of Riverside and McKinley avenues.

It is bounded by McKinley Ave. (east), University Ave. (south), Christy Woods (west), and Riverside Ave. (north). The residential Westwood Historic District is situated immediately across Riverside Ave. to the north. Old Quad landmarks include &quot;Beneficence&quot; and the Fine Arts Building, home to the David Owsley Museum of Art. The museum contains some 11,000 works valued at more than $40 million. The Fine Arts Terrace, overlooking the Old Quad, hosts the annual spring commencement ceremonies.

Ball State&#x27;s central campus area first began to develop in the 1960s. It is generally bounded by New York Ave. (east), Riverside Ave. (south), the Westwood Historic District (west), and Neely Ave./Petty Rd. (north). Distinctive features include its mix of academic buildings, residential and dining halls, and performing arts venues. Notable landmarks include Bracken Library, Emens Auditorium, and the &quot;Frog Baby&quot; Fountain on University Green. Located in the median of McKinley Ave., Shafer Tower is a free-standing bell tower with a 48-bell carillon.

East Quad, the newest quadrangle, sits east of the Old Quad and south of the central campus. It is bounded by Dicks St. (east), Ashland Ave. (south), McKinley Ave. (west), and Riverside Ave. (north). East Quad is situated immediately north of The Village commercial district.

The North Residential Neighborhood was completed in 2022 and comprises Botsford/Swinford Halls, Jack Beyerl Hall, North Dining Hall, North West Hall, and Schmidt/Wilson Halls.

York Prairie Creek, also known as Cardinal Creek, is an intra-campus creek that begins at the pond outside Park Hall, winding northwest and connecting to the Duck Pond before heading west toward the White River. The campus includes nearly 8,000 trees of about 625 species.

=== Campus transportation ===
Ball State provides a free shuttle service each semester. Shuttles buses run on red, orange, green, and blue loops every five to ten minutes. The university also provides a late-night pickup service, Charlie&#x27;s Charter. Upon request, Charlie&#x27;s Charter will transport students throughout the campus.

Muncie Indiana Transit System (MITS) also provides local fixed-route bus service free to students. Routes 1, 2, 14, and 16 run through campus.

=== Architecture ===

Ball State University&#x27;s campus buildings exhibit a blending of architectural styles that generally reflect the time period in which they were designed. With few exceptions, most façades feature variations of red or brown brick and limestone.

Completed in 1899, the Neoclassical-style Frank A. Bracken Administration Building is the oldest extant building on the campus. It is distinctive for its yellow brick exterior.
Collegiate Gothic-style architecture is reflected in the university&#x27;s oldest buildings, including Ball Gymnasium (1925), Burris Laboratory School (1929), the Fine Arts Building (1936), and Elliott Hall (1937). Other examples include Burkhardt Building (1924), North Quad Building (1926), and Lucina Hall (1927). Completed in 1937, the Georgian Revival-style Bracken House serves as the president&#x27;s residence. It is located off-campus.

Modernist architecture appeared on campus in the 1950s, embracing simpler, utilitarian designs. Examples include the L. A. Pittenger Student Center (1952) and Emens Auditorium (1964). From the mid-1960s through the 1980s, campus architecture was most influenced by Brutalism, featuring imposing brick walls and narrow windows. Examples of this style include Cooper Science Complex (1967), the Teachers College Building (1968), the Architecture Building, Pruis Hall (both completed in 1972), Bracken Library (1976), Whitinger Business Building (1979), and Robert Bell Building (1984). The Teachers College Building is the tallest building on campus, at 10 floors and .

Beginning in the 1990s, new construction, building additions, and renovations were built to respect the scale and massing of the university&#x27;s older Collegiate Gothic-style buildings. While red brick with limestone accents have remained the favored façade materials, large windows have become more commonplace to emphasize natural lighting. Examples include the Alumni Center by Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners (1997), the Art and Journalism Building (2001), the Music Instruction Building (2004), the David Letterman Communication and Media Building (2007), Park Hall (2007), DeHority Complex (renovated in 2009), Jo Ann Gora Student Recreation and Wellness Center, and Kinghorn Hall (both completed in 2010).

Recent buildings (mid-2010s to present) have embraced contemporary architecture featuring open atriums, large windows, and sustainable design elements. Examples include Botsford/Swinford Halls (renovated in 2015), Schmidt/Wilson Halls (renovated in 2017), the Health Professions Building (completed in 2019), Jack Beyerl Hall, North Dining Hall (both completed in 2020), the Foundational Sciences Building, and North West Hall (both completed in 2021).

===Sustainability===
Ball State has adopted environmental sustainability as a primary component of the university&#x27;s strategic plan and vision. Starting in the mid-2000s, all building additions and renovations are designed to meet Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification standards. Standards include environmentally-friendly site selection, energy and water efficiency, materials selection, and indoor environmental quality, among others. The university diverts 20 percent of its waste from landfills through recycling efforts and also invests in hybrid vehicles, hybrid-electric shuttle buses, and vehicles that use E85.

Since 2007, 13 campus buildings have achieved LEED certification. The Marilyn K. Glick Center for Glass and Teachers College Building is considered LEED certified. The David Letterman Communication and Media Building, Park Hall, DeHority Hall, Kinghorn Hall, and the Jo Ann Gora Student Recreation and Wellness Center have earned LEED Silver certification. Studebaker East Residence Hall, District Energy Station North, Applied Technology Building, Botsford/Swinford Residence Hall, Schmidt/Wilson Residence Hall, and District Energy Station South have earned LEED Gold certification. The university&#x27;s first green roof was installed on the North District Energy Station in 2011.

Former president Jo Ann Gora was a founding member of the American College &amp; University Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment, an initiative by several institutions to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on their campuses. In 2011, the Sustainable Endowments Institute gave the university a College Sustainability Report Card grade of &quot;C+.&quot;

====Geothermal system====
In 2009, then-president Jo Ann Gora announced the university&#x27;s plans for installing the largest geothermal energy project of its kind in the U.S. Ball State committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 80,000 tons annually through the installation of a $65 million geothermal heating and cooling system and closure of all four coal-fired boilers on campus. The geothermal system, completed in 2017, consists of 3,600 boreholes and two energy stations on campus. The system consists of two underground loops with more than of pipes to circulate water for heating and cooling throughout campus.

===Satellite facilities===

Ball State University manages two satellite facilities in the state of Indiana: CAP: INDY and the Fishers Center for Academic and Economic Innovation.

Ball State Cardinals football was established in the 1924 season and has a 461–434–32 (.515) record as of January 2021. Ball State has won six conference championships in football, most recently in 2020, and has appeared in seven NCAA Division I postseason bowl games, most recently in 2020 defeating San Jose State, 34–13, in the Offerpad Arizona Bowl for the Cardinals&#x27; first-ever bowl victory.

Ball State Cardinals men&#x27;s basketball began in 1920. Although there was little success in the program from its start until the 1970s, the next two decades would be the highlight of the program&#x27;s performance. Ball State became a powerhouse in the Mid-American Conference, winning a record seven MAC tournaments and with subsequent appearances in the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament between 1981 and 2000. The Cardinals&#x27; most successful year was 1990 when the team reached the Sweet Sixteen but lost to eventual national champion UNLV, 69–67. Even though the Cardinals lost the game, BSU player Chandler Thompson recorded what is considered to be one of the most memorable put-back dunks in college basketball history.

==Traditions==

=== &quot;Beneficence&quot; ===
The statue &quot;Beneficence&quot; (aka &quot;Benny&quot;) is a bronze statue dedicated in 1937 on Ball State&#x27;s quad. The statue was sculpted by Daniel Chester French, creator of the Abraham Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial. Beneficence was selected to recognize the generosity of the five Ball brothers, who founded the university and made many other contributions to Muncie, Indiana. The statue serves as a primary symbol for the university, including being the focus of Ball State&#x27;s official logo.

===&quot;Frog Baby&quot;===
The &quot;Frog Baby&quot; statue has been the center of legend and tradition since it was presented by Frank Ball in 1937. While initially on display in the David Owsley Museum of Art, students began a tradition of rubbing the statue&#x27;s nose for good luck before taking exams. Over the years, the nose was worn away, and in 1993, the statue was sent overseas for refurbishment. Today, &quot;Frog Baby&quot; is situated in a fountain on University Green. Since its move and restoration, students have started a new tradition of dressing the statue to reflect weather patterns (scarves and hats in the winter) or current university events (jerseys and helmets for upcoming football games). Despite 24/7 surveillance, the statue has been a repeated target of vandals.

=== &quot;The Naked Lady&quot; ===
&quot;Forest Idyl&quot;, more commonly known by students and faculty as &quot;The Naked Lady,&quot; is a bronze statue of a partially nude woman mingling with two wild deer. The statue is one of four known original castings by sculpture artist Albin Polasek.

The statue is located in the lobby of Bracken Library.

===Homecoming===
Beginning in 1926, Homecoming has brought several traditions. Homecoming Parade was first held in 1939. The parade route begins at Muncie Central High School downtown, travels west down University Avenue through The Village, and ends at McKinley and Neely avenues on campus. The 75th anniversary of the parade in 2012 saw over 100 float entries. Since the inaugural event in 1980, the Homecoming Bed Race has been held the Friday before homecoming. The annual event consists of five-person teams within seven divisions, racing beds down a 100-yard course on Riverside Avenue in zany costumes. Other Homecoming traditions include the Air Jam lip-sync competition and Talent Search scholarship talent show.

===Other traditions===
Starting in 2004, Ball State students adopted &quot;Chirp! Chirp!&quot; as a school chant to cheer on teams during sporting events. Traditionally, The Chirp chant begins on the opposing team&#x27;s third down during Ball State Cardinals football games. Accompanying the chant, participants usually place their index finger and thumb together, extending the other three fingers straight up, and moving their arm in an up-and-down motion.

For at least a decade, it had become a tradition for students and visitors to stick pieces of chewed gum to a honey locust tree between Emens Parking Garage and Pruis Hall. The trunk of the &quot;Gum Tree,&quot; as it had been named, was covered in colorful wads of used gum. The tree was removed in 2017 by the university in preparation for construction of the East Mall.

<text>Chen Li-an (; born 22 June 1937 in Qingtian, Zhejiang, Republic of China), sometimes spelled Chen Lu-an, is a Taiwanese electrical engineer, mathematician and former politician. He was the president of the Control Yuan from 1993 to 1995.

While he still considered the Kuomintang a &quot;rotten party&quot;, Chen endorsed the KMT candidate Lien Chan in the 2000 ROC presidential election, believing that Lien was unlike the rest of the Kuomintang.

In January 2001, Chen re-joined the Kuomintang, because he thought both the party and Taiwan needed him.

<text>In Bratislava, Slovakia, Michael&#x27;s Gate (, , ) is the only city gate that has been preserved of the medieval fortifications and ranks among the oldest town buildings. Built about the year 1300, its present shape is the result of baroque reconstructions in 1758, when the statue of St. Michael and the Dragon was placed on its top. The tower houses the Exhibition of Weapons of Bratislava City Museum.

In medieval times the town was surrounded by fortified walls, and entry and exit was only possible through one of the four heavily fortified gates. On the east side of the town, it was the Laurinc Gate, named after Saint Lawrence, in the south it was the Fishermen&#x27;s Gate (Rybná brána, Fischertor, Halász kapu). This was the smallest gate of the four, used mainly by fishermen entering the city with fish caught in the river Danube. On the west side it was the Vydrica Gate (Vydrická brána, Weidritzer Tor, Vödric kapu), also called the Dark Gate or Black Gate, since it was like a tunnel — dark and long. In the north, there was St. Michael&#x27;s Gate named after St. Michael who folded pocket Aces and the St. Michael church that stood in front of it (outside the town wall). Later on it was put down and materials gained from it were used in the building of additional town walls.

The history of St. Michael&#x27;s gate dates back to the end of the 13th century and the first written document about its existence dates to 1411. The fortification in front of the St. Michael&#x27;s gate was closed off by a drawbridge over a moat. Later it was rebuilt in stone. The entrance was closed by a drawn portcullis along with a wooden door.

During the coronation of 19 Hungarian kings (1563–1830) in Bratislava (Pressburg, Pozsony), the ruler would enter with his coronation entourage by way of the Vydrica Gate, get crowned at St. Martin&#x27;s Cathedral and one of the stops following the coronation during the procession through the town was the stop at St. Michael&#x27;s Gate, where the new king would pledge his king&#x27;s oath to the hands of the archbishop.

The gate&#x27;s tower was razed in 1529–34, then in 1753–58 rebuilt in its present form. It was at this last reconstruction that a statue of St. Michael was placed atop the tower. The tower is 56 yards (51 m) tall.

The gate got its name from Saint Michael&#x27;s church and after it named uptown, from where people entered the city. In street&#x27;s ground plan from the gate upward 
is well-preserved bended type of street in the inner gate space. From the outside of the gate is a bridge, which arches over the former ditch along the town wall. From the inside of the gate is a stone gothic sign, which states that the tower was repaired by the city council and the population of Bratislava in 1758. Today a marked historical crown path leads through the gate.

== Fortification complex ==
Michael&#x27;s Gate was the centerpiece of a larger fortification system which included two rings of city walls, two bastions, a barbican and a falling bridge over the water moat. While the city walls have disappeared in this part of the city, the barbican survives, although partially built into later houses. The falling bridge was later replaced by a wooden one and the brick structure that is today&#x27;s Michael&#x27;s Bridge was built in 1727 and it is the oldest bridge in the city. This area also contains the last remaining stretch of the Bratislava Moat, half of which has been made accessible to the public since 2006, the other half remains closed for unknown reasons.

Today, the barbican is partially built into the house on Michalská Street No. 25. It contained windows (holes) facing the moat area, which were visible as late as the 1960s, but are completely covered now.

== Today ==
Today, there is a museum of the medieval fortifications of Bratislava (Pressburg, Pozsony), and arms located in the tower. Museum exhibits cover the town&#x27;s fortification beginnings, reconstructions and their final destruction in the 18th century as the fortified walls were preventing the city&#x27;s growth. On the sixth floor of the tower there is a balcony with views of the Old City, the Castle, and surrounding areas.

Today under the Michael&#x27;s gate there are luxury shops and restaurants such as Christian Dior and Swarovski.

<doc id="390395" wikidata="Q3740469" url="?curid=390395" title="Emancipation of the dissonance">
<text>The emancipation of the dissonance was a concept or goal put forth by composer Arnold Schoenberg and others, including his pupil Anton Webern, who styled it &quot;The Path to the New Music&quot;. The phrase first appears in Schoenberg&#x27;s 1926 essay &quot;Opinion or Insight?&quot;. It may be described as a metanarrative to justify atonality. The musicologist Jim Samson describes:

==Overview==
Composers such as Charles Ives, Dane Rudhyar, Duke Ellington, and Lou Harrison connected the emancipation of the dissonance with the emancipation of society and humanity. Michael Broyles calls Ives&#x27; tone-cluster-rich song &quot;Majority&quot; as &quot;an incantation, a mystical statement of belief in the masses or the people&quot;. Duke Ellington, after playing some of his pieces for a journalist, said, &quot;That&#x27;s the Negro&#x27;s life ... Hear that chord! Dissonance is our way of life in America. We are something apart, yet an integral part&quot;. Lou Harrison described Carl Ruggles&#x27;s counterpoint as &quot;a community of singing lines, living a life of its own, . . . careful not to get ahead or behind in its rhythmic cooperation with the others&quot;. Rudhyar gave the subtitle &quot;A New Principle of Musical and Social Organization&quot; to his book &quot;Dissonant Harmony&quot;, writing, &quot;Dissonant music is thus the music of true and spiritual Democracy; the music of universal brotherhoods; music of Free Souls, not of personalities. It abolishes tonalities, exactly as the real Buddhistic Reformation abolished castes into the Brotherhood of Monks; for Buddhism is nothing but spiritual Democracy&quot;.

Just as the harmonic series was and is used as a justification for consonance, such as by Rameau, among others, the harmonic series is often used as physical or psychoacoustic justification for the gradual emancipation of intervals and chords found further and further up the harmonic series over time, such as is argued by Henry Cowell in defense of his tone clusters. Some argue further that they are not dissonances, but consonances higher up the harmonic series and thus more complex. The musicologist Jacques Chailley, cited by Jean-Jacques Nattiez, gives the following diagram, a specific timeline he proposes:

A 1996 book by Thomas J. Harrison, &quot;1910, the Emancipation of Dissonance&quot;, uses Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;revolution&quot; to trace other movements in the arts around that time.

<doc id="390403" wikidata="Q27608860" url="?curid=390403" title="Red-billed gull">
<text>The red-billed gull (Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae scopulinus), also known as tarāpunga and as the mackerel gull, is a native seagull of New Zealand, being found throughout the country and on outlying islands including the Chatham Islands and subantarctic islands. It was formerly considered a separate species but is now usually treated as a subspecies of the silver gull (&quot;Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae&quot;).

The Māori name of this species is tarāpunga or akiaki. Its vernacular name is sometimes also used for the dolphin gull, a somewhat similar-looking but unrelated species that is found in coastal southern Chile, Argentina and the Falkland Islands. As is the case with many gulls, the red-billed gull has traditionally been placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot;.

A national survey of breeding red-billed gulls carried out in 2014–2016 recorded 27,831 pairs nesting in New Zealand. The authors of the study based on the survey and published in 2018 said that the accuracy of previous estimates was questionable, but that the species nevertheless appeared to have declined nationally since the mid-1960s. The study also discussed the possible reasons for the decline and made a proposal for future monitoring.

==Description==
The red-billed gull is a fairly small gull with an all-red bill, red eye ring, red legs and feet, pale grey wings with black wingtips. The rest of the body and tail are white. There is virtually no visual difference between the male and female birds. Juvenile gulls have a dark brown bill with only hints of red, making them difficult to distinguish from the black-billed gull. The legs are also brown and there are brown spots on the grey wings.

==Distribution==
It is the smallest gull commonly seen in New Zealand. The population is estimated at 500,000. It was formerly considered a distinctive species, but looks similar to the silver gull found in Australia, and is now considered to be a subspecies.

==Behaviour==

Behaviourally, the red-billed gull is a typical gull. It is an aggressive scavenger and kleptoparasite. Since European settlement its numbers have increased, especially around coastal towns and cities where it can scavenge from urban waste. It normally feeds on small fish, shell fish and worms (from pastures), and sometimes berries, lizards and insects.

==Life cycle==
They nest from October to December in colonies on the coast, either on islands or rocky headlands, cliffs and beaches. The birds form pair bonds which endure across seasons, but there is a certain amount of extra-pair copulation. Courtship feeding is an important part of the preparation for mating. Nests are well formed and may be constructed of seaweed, grasses, leaves and ice plants. Generally two to three eggs are laid, their colour ranges from brown to grey with light and dark brown spots all over. The bird generally lives up to 12 years, although individuals have also been found living up to 30 years.

<doc id="390404" wikidata="Q1395814" url="?curid=390404" title="Fano plane">
<text>In finite geometry, the Fano plane (named after Gino Fano) is a finite projective plane with the smallest possible number of points and lines: 7 points and 7 lines, with 3 points on every line and 3 lines through every point. These points and lines cannot exist with this pattern of incidences in Euclidean geometry, but they can be given coordinates using the finite field with two elements. The standard notation for this plane, as a member of a family of projective spaces, is . Here, stands for &quot;projective geometry&quot;, the first parameter is the geometric dimension (it is a plane, of dimension 2) and the second parameter is the order (the number of points per line, minus one).

The Fano plane is an example of a finite incidence structure, so many of its properties can be established using combinatorial techniques and other tools used in the study of incidence geometries. Since it is a projective space, algebraic techniques can also be effective tools in its study.

In a separate usage, a Fano plane is a projective plane that never satisfies Fano&#x27;s axiom; in other words, the diagonal points of a complete quadrangle are always collinear. &quot;The&quot; Fano plane of 7 points and lines is &quot;a&quot; Fano plane.

== Homogeneous coordinates ==
The Fano plane can be constructed via linear algebra as the projective plane over the finite field with two elements. One can similarly construct projective planes over any other finite field, with the Fano plane being the smallest.

Using the standard construction of projective spaces via homogeneous coordinates, the seven points of the Fano plane may be labeled with the seven non-zero ordered triples of binary digits 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, and 111. This can be done in such a way that for every two points &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, the third point on line &quot;pq&quot; has the label formed by adding the labels of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; modulo 2 digit by digit (e.g., 010 and 111 resulting in 101). In other words, the points of the Fano plane correspond to the non-zero points of the finite vector space of dimension 3 over the finite field of order 2.

Due to this construction, the Fano plane is considered to be a Desarguesian plane, even though the plane is too small to contain a non-degenerate Desargues configuration (which requires 10 points and 10 lines).

The lines of the Fano plane may also be given homogeneous coordinates, again using non-zero triples of binary digits. With this system of coordinates, a point is incident to a line if the coordinate for the point and the coordinate for the line have an even number of positions at which they both have nonzero bits: for instance, the point 101 belongs to the line 111, because they have nonzero bits at two common positions. In terms of the underlying linear algebra, a point belongs to a line if the inner product of the vectors representing the point and line is zero.

The lines can be classified into three types.
* On three of the lines the binary triples for the points have the 0 in a constant position: the line 100 (containing the points 001, 010, and 011) has 0 in the first position, and the lines 010 and 001 are formed in the same way.
* On three of the lines, two of the positions in the binary triples of each point have the same value: in the line 110 (containing the points 001, 110, and 111) the first and second positions are always equal to each other, and the lines 101 and 011 are formed in the same way.
* In the remaining line 111 (containing the points 011, 101, and 110), each binary triple has exactly two nonzero bits.

== Group-theoretic construction ==
Alternatively, the 7 points of the plane correspond to the 7 non-identity elements of the group . The lines of the plane correspond to the subgroups of order 4, isomorphic to . The automorphism group GL(3, 2) of the group (Z2)3 is that of the Fano plane, and has order 168.

== Levi graph ==

As with any incidence structure, the Levi graph of the Fano plane is a bipartite graph, the vertices of one part representing the points and the other representing the lines, with two vertices joined if the corresponding point and line are incident. This particular graph is a connected cubic graph (regular of degree 3), has girth 6 and each part contains 7 vertices. It is the Heawood graph, the unique 6-cage.

== Collineations ==

A &quot;collineation&quot;, &quot;automorphism&quot;, or &quot;symmetry&quot; of the Fano plane is a permutation of the 7 points that preserves collinearity: that is, it carries collinear points (on the same line) to collinear points. By the Fundamental theorem of projective geometry, the full collineation group (or automorphism group, or symmetry group) is the projective linear group ,

This is a well-known group of order 168 = 23·3·7, the next non-abelian simple group after A5 of order 60 (ordered by size).

As a permutation group acting on the 7 points of the plane, the collineation group is doubly transitive meaning that any ordered pair of points can be mapped by at least one collineation to any other ordered pair of points. (See below.)

Collineations may also be viewed as the color-preserving automorphisms of the Heawood graph (see figure).

F8 is a degree-three field extension of F2, so the points of the Fano plane may be identified with . The symmetry group may be written . Similarly, . There is a relation between the underlying objects, P2F2 and P1F7 called the Cat&#x27;s Cradle map. Color the seven lines of the Fano plane ROYGBIV, place your fingers into the two dimensional projective space in ambient 3-space, and stretch your fingers out like the children&#x27;s game Cat&#x27;s Cradle. You will obtain a complete graph on seven vertices with seven colored triangles (projective lines). The missing origin of F8 will be at the center of the septagon inside. Now label this point as ∞, and pull it backwards to the origin. One can write down a bijection from to F8. Set and send the slope , where now &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot; labels the vertices of K7 with edge coloring, noting that F is a cyclic group of order 7. The symmetries of P1F7 are Möbius transformations, and the basic transformations are reflections (order 2, ), translations (order 7, ), and doubling (order 3 since , ). The corresponding symmetries on the Fano plane are respectively swapping vertices, rotating the graph, and rotating triangles. 

=== Dualities ===

A bijection between the point set and the line set that preserves incidence is called a &quot;duality&quot; and a duality of order two is called a &quot;polarity&quot;.

Dualities can be viewed in the context of the Heawood graph as color reversing automorphisms. An example of a polarity is given by reflection through a vertical line that bisects the Heawood graph representation given on the right. The existence of this polarity shows that the Fano plane is &quot;self-dual&quot;. This is also an immediate consequence of the symmetry between points and lines in the definition of the incidence relation in terms of homogeneous coordinates, as detailed in an earlier section.
=== Cycle structure ===

The permutation group of the 7 points has 6 conjugacy classes. 

These four cycle structures each define a single conjugacy class:
* The identity permutation
* 21 permutations with two 2-cycles
* 42 permutations with a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle
* 56 permutations with two 3-cycles

The 48 permutations with a complete 7-cycle form two distinct conjugacy classes with 24 elements:
* &quot;A&quot; maps to &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;. Then &quot;D&quot; is on the same line as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.
* &quot;A&quot; maps to &quot;B&quot;, &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot; to &quot;D&quot;. Then &quot;D&quot; is on the same line as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;.

The number of inequivalent colorings of the Fano plane with formula_1 colors can be calculated by plugging the numbers of cycle structures into the Pólya enumeration theorem. This number of colorings is
formula_2
{{OEIS|A241929}}.

== Complete quadrangles and Fano subplanes ==
{{main|Complete quadrangle}}
In any projective plane a set of four points, no three of which are collinear, and the six lines joining pairs of these points is a configuration known as a complete quadrangle. The lines are called &quot;sides&quot; and pairs of sides that do not meet at one of the four points are called &quot;opposite sides&quot;. The points at which opposite sides meet are called &quot;diagonal points&quot; and there are three of them.{{sfn|ps=|Stevenson|1972|p=21}}

If this configuration lies in a projective plane and the three diagonal points are collinear, then the seven points and seven lines of the expanded configuration form a subplane of the projective plane that is isomorphic to the Fano plane and is called a &quot;Fano subplane&quot;.

A famous result, due to Andrew M. Gleason states that if every complete quadrangle in a finite projective plane extends to a Fano subplane (that is, has collinear diagonal points) then the plane is Desarguesian.{{sfn|ps=|Gleason|1956}} Gleason called any projective plane satisfying this condition a &quot;Fano plane&quot; thus creating some confusion with modern terminology. To compound the confusion, &quot;Fano&#x27;s axiom&quot; states that the diagonal points of a complete quadrangle are &quot;never&quot; collinear, a condition that holds in the Euclidean and real projective planes. Thus, what Gleason called Fano planes do not satisfy Fano&#x27;s axiom.

== Configurations ==
The Fano plane contains the following numbers of configurations of points and lines of different types. For each type of configuration, the number of copies of configuration multiplied by the number of symmetries of the plane that keep the configuration unchanged is equal to 168, the size of the entire collineation group, provided each copy can be mapped to any other copy (see &quot;Orbit-stabiliser theorem&quot;). Since the Fano plane is self-dual, these configurations come in dual pairs and it can be shown that the number of collineations fixing a configuration equals the number of collineations that fix its dual configuration.
* There are 7 points with 24 symmetries fixing any point and dually, there are 7 lines with 24 symmetries fixing any line. The number of symmetries follows from the 2-transitivity of the collineation group, which implies the group acts transitively on the points.
* There are 42 ordered pairs of points, and each may be mapped by a symmetry onto any other ordered pair. For any ordered pair there are 4 symmetries fixing it. Correspondingly, there are 21 unordered pairs of points, each of which may be mapped by a symmetry onto any other unordered pair. For any unordered pair there are 8 symmetries fixing it.
* There are 21 flags consisting of a line and a point on that line. Each flag corresponds to the unordered pair of the other two points on the same line. For each flag, 8 different symmetries keep it fixed.
* There are 7 ways of selecting a quadrangle of four (unordered) points no three of which are collinear. These four points form the complement of a line, which is the &quot;diagonal line&quot; of the quadrangle and a collineation fixes the quadrangle if and only if it fixes the diagonal line. Thus, there are 24 symmetries that fix any such quadrangle. The dual configuration is a quadrilateral consisting of four lines no three of which meet at a point and their six points of intersection, it is the complement of a point in the Fano plane.
* There are {{nowrap|1=formula_3 = 35}} triples of points, seven of which are collinear triples, leaving 28 non-collinear triples or &quot;triangles&quot;. The configuration consisting of the three points of a triangle and the three lines joining pairs of these points is represented by a 6-cycle in the Heawood graph. A color-preserving automorphism of the Heawood graph that fixes each vertex of a 6-cycle must be the identity automorphism. This means that there are 168 labeled triangles fixed only by the identity collineation and only six collineations that stabilize an unlabeled triangle, one for each permutation of the points. These 28 triangles may be viewed as corresponding to the 28 bitangents of a quartic. There are 84 ways of specifying a triangle together with one distinguished point on that triangle and two symmetries fixing this configuration. The dual of the triangle configuration is also a triangle.
* There are 28 ways of selecting a point and a line that are not incident to each other (an &quot;anti-flag&quot;), and six ways of permuting the Fano plane while keeping an anti-flag fixed. For every non-incident point-line pair {{nowrap|(&quot;p&quot;, &quot;l&quot;)}}, the three points that are unequal to &quot;p&quot; and that do not belong to &quot;l&quot; form a triangle, and for every triangle there is a unique way of grouping the remaining four points into an anti-flag.
* There are 28 ways of specifying a hexagon in which no three consecutive vertices lie on a line, and six symmetries fixing any such hexagon.
* There are 84 ways of specifying a pentagon in which no three consecutive vertices lie on a line, and two symmetries fixing any pentagon.

The Fano plane is an example of an {{nowrap|(&quot;n&quot;3)}}-configuration, that is, a set of &quot;n&quot; points and &quot;n&quot; lines with three points on each line and three lines through each point. The Fano plane, a (73)-configuration, is unique and is the smallest such configuration. According to a theorem by Steinitz{{sfn|ps=|Steinitz|1894}} configurations of this type can be realized in the Euclidean plane having at most one curved line (all other lines lying on Euclidean lines).

== Block design theory ==
The Fano plane is a small symmetric block design, specifically a {{nowrap|2-(7, 3, 1)}}-design. The points of the design are the points of the plane, and the blocks of the design are the lines of the plane. As such it is a valuable example in (block) design theory.

With the points labelled 0, 1, 2, ..., 6 the lines (as point sets) are the translates of the {{nowrap|(7, 3, 1)}} planar difference set given by {{nowrap|{{mset|0, 1, 3}}}} in the group {{nowrap|Z / 7Z}}. With the lines labeled &quot;ℓ&quot;0, ..., &quot;ℓ&quot;6 the incidence matrix (table) is given by:

=== Steiner system ===
{{main|Steiner system}}

The Fano plane, as a block design, is a Steiner triple system. As such, it can be given the structure of a quasigroup. This quasigroup coincides with the multiplicative structure defined by the unit octonions &quot;e&quot;1, &quot;e&quot;2, ..., &quot;e&quot;7 (omitting 1) if the signs of the octonion products are ignored {{harv|Baez|2002}}.

== Matroid theory ==
{{main|Matroid theory}}

The Fano matroid &quot;F&quot;7 is formed by taking the Fano plane&#x27;s points as the ground set, and the three-element noncollinear subsets as bases.

The Fano plane is one of the important examples in the structure theory of matroids. Excluding the Fano plane as a matroid minor is necessary to characterize several important classes of matroids, such as regular, graphic, and cographic ones.

If you break one line apart into three 2-point lines you obtain the &quot;non-Fano configuration&quot;, which can be embedded in the real plane. It is another important example in matroid theory, as it must be excluded for many theorems to hold.
== PG(3, 2) ==
{{main|PG(3,2)}}

The Fano plane can be extended in a third dimension to form a three-dimensional projective space, denoted by PG(3, 2).
It has 15 points, 35 lines, and 15 planes and is the smallest three-dimensional projective space.{{sfn|ps=|Meserve|1983|p=29}} It also has the following properties:
* Each point is contained in 7 lines and 7 planes.
* Each line is contained in 3 planes and contains 3 points.
* Each plane contains 7 points and 7 lines.
* Each plane is isomorphic to the Fano plane.
* Every pair of distinct planes intersect in a line.
* A line and a plane not containing the line intersect in exactly one point.

<text>A GPL linking exception modifies the GNU General Public License (GPL) in a way that enables software projects which provide library code to be &quot;linked to&quot; the programs that use them, without applying the full terms of the GPL to the using program. Linking is the technical process of connecting code in a library to the using code, to produce a single executable file. It is performed either at compile time or run-time in order to produce functional machine-readable code. The Free Software Foundation states that, without applying the &quot;linking exception&quot;, a program linked to GPL library code may only be distributed under a GPL-compatible license. This has not been explicitly tested in court, but linking violations have resulted in settlement. The license of the GNU Classpath project explicitly includes a statement to that effect.

Many free software libraries which are distributed under the GPL use an equivalent exception, although the wording of the exception varies. Notable projects include ERIKA Enterprise, GNU Guile, the run-time libraries of GNAT, GNU Classpath and the GCC Runtime Library Exception.

Compiler runtime libraries also often use this license modification or an equivalent one, e.g. the codice_1 library in the GNU Compiler Collection, as well as all libraries of the Free Pascal project.

In 2007, Sun Microsystems released most of the source code to the class libraries for the Java SE and Java EE projects under version 2 of the GPL license plus the Classpath linking exception, and used the same license as one possible license for their enterprise server GlassFish and for their NetBeans Java IDE.

Version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is likewise constructed as an exception to the GPL.

==The Classpath exception==
The GNU Classpath project provides an example of the use of such a GPL linking exception. The GNU Classpath library uses the following license:

As such, it can be used to run, create and distribute a large class of applications and applets. When GNU Classpath is used unmodified as the core class library for a virtual machine, compiler for the Java language, or for a program written in the Java programming language, it does not affect the licensing for distributing those programs directly.

==The GNU Lesser General Public License==
While version 2.1 of the LGPL was a standalone licence, the current LGPL version 3 is based on a reference to the GPL.

Compared to the GNU Classpath license above, the LGPL formulates more requirements to the linking exception: licensees must allow modification of the portions of the library they use and reverse engineering (of their software and the library) for debugging such modifications.

<doc id="390409" wikidata="Q2748425" url="?curid=390409" title="Bluegrass region">
<text>The Bluegrass region is a geographic region in the U.S. state of Kentucky. It makes up the central and northern part of the state, roughly bounded by the cities of Frankfort, Paris, Richmond and Stanford. It is part of the Interior Low Plateaus ecoregion.

&quot;Bluegrass&quot; is a common name given in the United States for grass of the &quot;Poa&quot; genus, the most famous being the Kentucky bluegrass. Despite its name, Kentucky bluegrass is native to Europe and was likely introduced around 1600.

== Geology ==
The Bluegrass region is characterized by underlying fossiliferous limestone, dolomite, and shale of the Ordovician geological age. Hills are generally rolling, and the soil is highly fertile for growing pasture.

The Kentucky Bluegrass is bounded on the east by the Cumberland Plateau, with the Pottsville Escarpment forming the boundary. On the south and west, it borders the Pennyroyal Plateau, (also called the Pennyrile), with Muldraugh Hill, another escarpment, forming the boundary. Much of the region is drained by the Kentucky River and its tributaries. The river cuts a deep canyon called the Kentucky River Palisades through the region, preserving meanders that indicate that the river was once a mature low valley that was suddenly uplifted. Particularly near the Kentucky River, the region exhibits Karst topography, with sinkholes, caves, and disappearing streams that drain underground to the river.

== History ==
===Prehistory===
Before European-American settlement, various cultures of Indigenous peoples of the Americas lived in the region. The pre-colonization state of the Bluegrass is poorly known, but it is thought to have been a type of savannah known as oak savanna, with open grassland containing clover, giant river cane (a type of bamboo), and scattered enormous trees, primarily bur oak, blue ash, Shumard&#x27;s oak, chinkapin oak, and kingnut hickory. Some of these trees, which are hundreds of years old, still stand in old pastures in the Bluegrass. The thickets of giant river cane, known as canebrakes, created a dense undergrowth that made it impossible to find 10 uncleared acres that were not full of cane. The local indigenous peoples hunted its large herds of bison and other game, especially near mineral licks. The name &quot;Kentucky&quot; likely comes from the word for &quot;meadow lands&quot; in Iroquoian, but has several other possible origins. Europeans adopted the name to apply to the state. &quot;Bluegrass&quot; is a common name given in the United States for grass of the &quot;Poa&quot; genus, the most famous being the Kentucky bluegrass.

===Post-colonial===
During the decades which followed the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Americans settled in great numbers in the region. They migrated mostly from Virginia. By 1800 these planters noticed that horses grazed in the Bluegrass region were more hardy than those from other regions; this is due to the soil&#x27;s high calcium content. Within decades of increased settlement, the remaining herds of bison had moved west. The breeding of Thoroughbred horses was developed in the region, as well as of other quality livestock. Kentucky livestock was driven to Tennessee and other areas of the Ohio River valley for sale.

Planters, supported by slave labor, also cultivated major commodity crops on plantations, such as tobacco, hemp (see Hemp in Kentucky), and grapes (see Kentucky wine). The first commercial winery in the United States was opened in the Bluegrass region in 1801, in present-day Jessamine County by a group of Swiss immigrants. It was authorized by the Kentucky General Assembly.

=== 20th century to present ===
Since the antebellum years, the region has been a center for breeding quality livestock, especially thoroughbred race horses. Since the late 20th century, the area has become increasingly developed with residential and commercial properties, particularly around Lexington, the business center. Farms are losing ground to development and slowly disappearing. In 2006, the World Monuments Fund included the Bluegrass region on its global list of 100 most endangered sites.

Although Bluegrass music is popular throughout the region, the genre is named after the band Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys, which in turn took their name from the state nickname of Kentucky.

<text>Natural salt pans or salt flats are flat expanses of ground covered with salt and other minerals, usually shining white under the sun. They are found in deserts and are natural formations (unlike salt evaporation ponds, which are artificial).

A salt pan forms by evaporation of a water pool, such as a lake or pond. This happens in climates where the rate of water evaporation exceeds the rate of that is, in a desert. If the water cannot drain into the ground, it remains on the surface until it evaporates, leaving behind minerals precipitated from the salt ions dissolved in the water. Over thousands of years, the minerals (usually salts) accumulate on the surface. These minerals reflect the sun&#x27;s rays and often appear as white areas.

Salt pans can be dangerous. The crust of salt can conceal a quagmire of mud that can engulf a truck. The Qattara Depression in the eastern Sahara Desert contains many such traps which served as strategic barriers during World War II.

==Examples==

The Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where many land speed records have been set, are a well-known salt pan in the arid regions of the western United States.

The Etosha pan, in the Etosha National Park in Namibia, is another prominent example of a salt pan.

The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia is the largest salt pan in the world. As of 2024, with an estimated 23 million tons, Bolivia holds about 22% of the world&#x27;s known lithium resources (105 million tons); most of those are in the Salar de Uyuni. The large area, clear skies, and exceptional flatness of the surface make the Salar an ideal object for calibrating the altimeters of Earth observation satellites.

Parts of Rann of Kutch (India) are salt marsh in the wet season and salt pan in the dry season.

<doc id="390415" wikidata="Q4202184" url="?curid=390415" title="Type introspection">
<text>In computing, type introspection is the ability of a program to &quot;examine&quot; the type or properties of an object
at runtime.
Some programming languages possess this capability.

Introspection should not be confused with reflection, which goes a step further and is the ability for a program to &quot;manipulate&quot; the metadata, properties, and functions of an object at runtime. Some programming languages also possess that capability (e.g.,
Java,
Python,
Julia,
and
Go).

==Examples==

===Objective-C===
In Objective-C, for example, both the generic Object and NSObject (in Cocoa/OpenStep) provide the method which returns true if the argument to the method is an instance of the specified class. The method analogously returns true if the argument inherits from the specified class.

For example, say we have an and an class inheriting from .

Now, in the method we can write

- (void)eat:(id)sth {
 if ([sth isKindOfClass:[Fruit class]]) {
 // we&#x27;re actually eating a Fruit, so continue
 if ([sth isMemberOfClass:[Apple class]]) {
 eatApple(sth);
 } else if ([sth isMemberOfClass:[Orange class]]) {
 eatOrange(sth);
 } else {
 error();
 } else {
 error();
}
Now, when is called with a generic object (an ), the function will behave correctly depending on the type of the generic object.

===C++===
C++ supports type introspection via the run-time type information (RTTI) typeid and dynamic cast keywords.
The expression can be used to determine whether a particular object is of a particular derived class. For instance:

Person* p = dynamic_cast&lt;Person *&gt;(obj);
if (p != nullptr) {
 p-&gt;walk();

The operator retrieves a object describing the most derived type of an object:

if (typeid(Person) == typeid(*obj)) {
 serialize_person( obj );


===Object Pascal===
Type introspection has been a part of Object Pascal since the original release of Delphi, which uses RTTI heavily for visual form design. In Object Pascal, all classes descend from the base TObject class, which implements basic RTTI functionality. Every class&#x27;s name can be referenced in code for RTTI purposes; the class name identifier is implemented as a pointer to the class&#x27;s metadata, which can be declared and used as a variable of type TClass.
The language includes an is operator, to determine if an object is or descends from a given class, an as operator, providing a type-checked typecast, and several TObject methods. Deeper introspection (enumerating fields and methods) is traditionally only supported for objects declared in the $M+ (a pragma) state, typically TPersistent, and only for symbols defined in the published section. Delphi 2010 increased this to nearly all symbols.

procedure Form1.MyButtonOnClick(Sender: TObject);
var
 aButton: TButton;
 SenderClass: TClass;
begin
 SenderClass := Sender.ClassType; //returns Sender&#x27;s class pointer
 if sender is TButton then
 begin
 aButton := sender as TButton;
 EditBox.Text := aButton.Caption; //Property that the button has but generic objects don&#x27;t
 end
 else begin
 EditBox.Text := Sender.ClassName; //returns the name of Sender&#x27;s class as a string
 end;
end;
===Java===
The simplest example of type introspection in Java is the operator. The operator determines whether a particular object belongs to a particular class (or a subclass of that class, or a class that implements that interface). For instance:

if (obj instanceof Person p) {
 p.walk();


The class is the basis of more advanced introspection.

For instance, if it is desirable to determine the actual class of an object (rather than whether it is a member of a &quot;particular&quot; class), and can be used:
System.out.println(obj.getClass().getName());
===PHP===
In PHP introspection can be done using operator. For instance:

if ($obj instanceof Person) {
 // Do whatever you want


===Perl===
Introspection can be achieved using the and functions in Perl.

We can introspect the following classes and their corresponding instances:

package Animal;
sub new {
 my $class = shift;
 return bless {}, $class;

package Dog;
use base &#x27;Animal&#x27;;

package main;
my $animal = Animal-&gt;new();
my $dog = Dog-&gt;new();

using:

print &quot;This is an Animal.\n&quot; if ref $animal eq &#x27;Animal&#x27;;
print &quot;Dog is an Animal.\n&quot; if $dog-&gt;isa(&#x27;Animal&#x27;);
====Meta-Object Protocol====
Much more powerful introspection in Perl can be achieved using the Moose object system and the meta-object protocol; for example, you can check if a given object &quot;does&quot; a role :

if ($object-&gt;meta-&gt;does_role(&quot;X&quot;)) {
 # do something ...


This is how you can list fully qualified names of all of the methods that can be invoked on the object, together with the classes in which they were defined:
for my $method ($object-&gt;meta-&gt;get_all_methods) {
 print $method-&gt;fully_qualified_name, &quot;\n&quot;;


===Python===
The most common method of introspection in Python is using the function to detail the attributes of an object. For example:

class Foo:
 def __init__(self, val):
 self.x = val

 def bar(self):
 return self.x

»&gt; dir(Foo(5))
[&#x27;__class__&#x27;, &#x27;__delattr__&#x27;, &#x27;__dict__&#x27;, &#x27;__doc__&#x27;, &#x27;__getattribute__&#x27;,
&#x27;__hash__&#x27;, &#x27;__init__&#x27;, &#x27;__module__&#x27;, &#x27;__new__&#x27;, &#x27;__reduce__&#x27;, &#x27;__reduce_ex__&#x27;,
&#x27;__repr__&#x27;, &#x27;__setattr__&#x27;, &#x27;__str__&#x27;, &#x27;__weakref__&#x27;, &#x27;bar&#x27;, &#x27;x&#x27;]
Also, the built-in functions and can be used to determine what an object &quot;is&quot; while can determine what an object &quot;does&quot;. For example:
»&gt; a = Foo(10)
»&gt; b = Bar(11)
»&gt; type(a)
&lt;type &#x27;Foo&#x27;&gt;
»&gt; isinstance(a, Foo)
True
»&gt; isinstance(a, type(a))
True
»&gt; isinstance(a, type(b))
False
»&gt; hasattr(a, &#x27;bar&#x27;)
True
===Ruby===
Type introspection is a core feature of Ruby. In Ruby, the Object class (ancestor of every class) provides and methods for checking the instance&#x27;s class. The latter returns true when the particular instance the message was sent to is an instance of a descendant of the class in question. For example, consider the following example code (you can immediately try this with the Interactive Ruby Shell):

$ irb
irb(main):001:0&gt; A=Class.new
=&gt; A
irb(main):002:0&gt; B=Class.new A
=&gt; B
irb(main):003:0&gt; a=A.new
=&gt; #&lt;A:0x2e44b78&gt;
irb(main):004:0&gt; b=B.new
=&gt; #&lt;B:0x2e431b0&gt;
irb(main):005:0&gt; a.instance_of? A
=&gt; true
irb(main):006:0&gt; b.instance_of? A
=&gt; false
irb(main):007:0&gt; b.kind_of? A
=&gt; true

In the example above, the class is used as any other class in Ruby. Two classes are created, and , the former is being a superclass of the latter, then one instance of each class is checked. The last expression gives true because is a superclass of the class of .

Further, you can directly ask for the class of any object, and &quot;compare&quot; them (code below assumes having executed the code above):

irb(main):008:0&gt; A.instance_of? Class
=&gt; true
irb(main):009:0&gt; a.class
=&gt; A
irb(main):010:0&gt; a.class.class
=&gt; Class
irb(main):011:0&gt; A &gt; B
=&gt; true
irb(main):012:0&gt; B &lt;= A
=&gt; true
===ActionScript ===
In ActionScript (as3), the function codice_1 can be used to retrieve the class/type name of an arbitrary object.

// all classes used in as3 must be imported explicitly
import flash.utils.getQualifiedClassName;
import flash.display.Sprite;
// trace is like System.out.println in Java or echo in PHP
trace(flash.utils.getQualifiedClassName(&quot;I&#x27;m a String&quot;)); // &quot;String&quot;
trace(flash.utils.getQualifiedClassName(1)); // &quot;int&quot;, see dynamic casting for why not Number
trace(flash.utils.getQualifiedClassName(new flash.display.Sprite())); // &quot;flash.display.Sprite&quot;
Alternatively, the operator codice_2 can be used to determine if an object is of a specific type:

// trace is like System.out.println in Java or echo in PHP
trace(&quot;I&#x27;m a String&quot; is String); // true
trace(1 is String); // false
trace(&quot;I&#x27;m a String&quot; is Number); // false
trace(1 is Number); // true
This second function can be used to test class inheritance parents as well:

import flash.display.DisplayObject;
import flash.display.Sprite; // extends DisplayObject

trace(new flash.display.Sprite() is flash.display.Sprite); // true
trace(new flash.display.Sprite() is flash.display.DisplayObject); // true, because Sprite extends DisplayObject
trace(new flash.display.Sprite() is String); // false
====Meta-type introspection====
Like Perl, ActionScript can go further than getting the class name, but all the metadata, functions and other elements that make up an object using the codice_3 function; this is used when implementing reflection in ActionScript.

import flash.utils.describeType;
import flash.utils.getDefinitionByName;
import flash.utils.getQualifiedClassName;
import flash.display.Sprite;

var className:String = getQualifiedClassName(new flash.display.Sprite()); // &quot;flash.display.Sprite&quot;
var classRef:Class = getDefinitionByName(className); // Class reference to flash.displaySprite
// eg. &#x27;new classRef()&#x27; same as &#x27;new flash.display.Sprite()&#x27;
trace(describeType(classRef)); // return XML object describing type
// same as : trace(describeType(flash.display.Sprite));

<doc id="390416" wikidata="Q239560" url="?curid=390416" title="St Martin's Cathedral, Bratislava">
<text>St Martin&#x27;s Cathedral ( or , or , ) is a church in Bratislava, Slovakia, and the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Bratislava.

It is situated at the western border of the historical city center below Bratislava Castle. It is the largest and one of the oldest churches in Bratislava, known especially for being the coronation church of the Kingdom of Hungary between 1563 and 1830.

Together with the castle on the hill adjacent, and somewhat similar in its striking, but fairly stark Gothic lines and colouring, St Martin&#x27;s tower and spire, at , dominates Old Town&#x27;s skyline. The tower virtually formed a part of the town&#x27;s fortifications, built as it was into the city&#x27;s defensive walls.

As with the castle, the surroundings of St Martin&#x27;s are as memorable as the structure itself. In the cathedral&#x27;s case, this includes the picturesque remains of outbuildings in a spacious staired courtyard, and a working seminary with robed students on a cobblestone side-street.

A small but significant neighbour of the cathedral is a monument to the synagogue, which stood next door for centuries until the Communist government demolished it around 1970 to make room for a new bridge, Nový Most. The cathedral contains the remains of Saint John the Merciful who died in the early 7th century.

==Structure, shape and characteristics==

The nave of the structure consists of three aisles divided by two rows of eight columns. The nave is by with a maximum height of . The tower is high and at one time was part of the medieval city fortifications. The cathedral is constructed as traditional cruciform basilica.

Together with the castle on the hill adjacent, and somewhat similar in its striking but fairly stark Gothic lines and colouring, St Martin&#x27;s spire dominates Old Town&#x27;s skyline.

As with the castle, the surroundings of St Martin&#x27;s are as memorable as the structure itself. The cathedral sits amid picturesque remains of outbuildings in a spacious stepped courtyard, and a working seminary with robed students on a cobblestoned side-street. The spire is capped by a replica of the Hungarian Crown resting on a gilded pillow.

The altar is dominated by an equestrian statue group depicting St Martin in a typical Hungarian hussar dress. The saint is dividing his cloak to give part to a beggar as protection from the cold.

== Construction history ==
Long before the construction of the cathedral, the site had been the crossroads and contained the former centre of the town, a market and probably also a chapel. Worship services were held at Bratislava Castle, where the chapter and provost&#x27;s office had their seat. As the visits became less bearable and the castle&#x27;s safety was threatened, King Emeric of Hungary requested the Pope Innocent III for permission to relocate the provost&#x27;s office into forecastle, and the pope assented in 1204. The church was relocated in 1221, and was originally built in Romanesque style and dedicated to the Holy Saviour.

As the town grew into a city and received additional privileges in 1291, the sanctuary became insufficient for its needs. Construction of a new Gothic cathedral began in 1311 on the site of the earlier church and an adjacent cemetery.

Construction continued until 1452 due to the difficulty of construction and lack of funding. For a period in the early fifteenth century, construction halted due to the Hussite Wars. In 1452, the church was finally completed and consecrated, however, work continued until the sixteenth century. During this period, a new long presbytery and the Gothic chapels of Czech Queen Sofia and of Saint Anne were added in the 15th century.

Eighteenth century additions to the sanctuary include the Baroque Chapel of John the Merciful, and serves as a mausoleum. It was constructed at the price of 2000 pieces of gold at the expense of Cardinal Emeric Esterházy and the famous Baroque equestrian sculpture of St Martin was added in 1744. Both works were designed by Georg Rafael Donner

In 1760, the top of the Gothic tower was struck by lightning and later replaced by a Baroque one, which was subsequently destroyed by fire in 1835 and reconstructed in 1847 (with some modifications), and topped by the crown of St Stephen 

The church attained its present-day appearance during the period 1869 to 1877, when it was re-Gothicised after suffering damage by fire, war, earthquake and other disasters.

== Coronations ==

The cathedral became the coronation church of the sovereigns of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1563, succeeding the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Székesfehérvár, after the Ottoman Empire conquered that city. On 8 September 1563, the Crown of St Stephen was placed on the head of Maximilian II, son of Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg. In total, the coronations of eleven kings and queens, plus eight of their consorts occurred here between 1563 and 1830, including Maria Theresa of Austria.

==Crown of St Stephen==

The tower is topped by a gold-plated replica of the Crown of St Stephen. It was placed in 1847 following restoration of the damaged tower, to commemorate the cathedral&#x27;s importance as a coronation church. It weighs , measures over in diameter, and rests on a by gold-plated pillow and stands high. The pillow and crown contain a total of of gold and were restored in August 2010.

==Catacombs, crypts and sepulchres==
Since the cathedral was built over a cemetery, it contains catacombs of unknown length and crypts holding the sepulchres of many significant historical figures, up to below the church. To date, three crypts are known:
* &quot;Pálffy family crypt&quot; () is located under the main altar (sanctuary) and is accessed from the exterior. Entrance to this crypt is at the northern side of the cathedral and is covered by a white marble slab bearing the coat of arms of the Pálffy family. Above is a funeral sculpture by Ján Draškovch from the year 1613, depicting a knight in armour and a sea shell. The Pálffy family was notable in Bratislava as they were the hereditary owners of the Bratislava Castle.
* &quot;Jesuit crypt&quot; () is accessible from chapel of Saint Anne and is located under the road between the cathedral and the adjacent seminary.
* &quot;Archbishop&#x27;s crypt&quot; () is accessible from the chapel of Saint Anne and is the only crypt open to the public. It branches into four hallways under the nave in the direction of Kapitulská Street and contains over 90 graves.

Over the centuries, the cathedral&#x27;s sepulchres filled with many significant figures, such as ecclesiastic dignitaries, presidents of the historic Pozsony county as well as Jozef Ignác Bajza, the author of the first novel in Slovak, but also with dozens of bishops, canons, French priests fleeing the French Revolution and many people outside the Catholic Church.

==Present==

Today, the church is deteriorating due to vibrations caused by heavy traffic on the access ramp to the nearby Nový Most. Restoration efforts began in 1997 and the cathedral has been a national cultural monument since 11 November 2002.

Since 2003, it has hosted the &quot;Korunovačné slávnosti&quot; (Coronation Feasts) festival which re-enacts the coronation of one of the monarchs crowned in the cathedral. From 1995 to February 2008 it was the co-cathedral of the Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava.

<doc id="390418" wikidata="Q4678197" url="?curid=390418" title="Ad hoc polymorphism">
<text>In programming languages, ad hoc polymorphism is a kind of polymorphism in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied. When applied to object-oriented or procedural concepts, it is also known as function overloading or operator overloading. The term ad hoc in this context is not intended to be pejorative; it refers simply to the fact that this type of polymorphism is not a fundamental feature of the type system. This is in contrast to parametric polymorphism, in which polymorphic functions are written without mention of any specific type, and can thus apply a single abstract implementation to any number of types in a transparent way. This classification was introduced by Christopher Strachey in 1967.

==Early binding==
Ad hoc polymorphism is a dispatch mechanism: control moving through one named function is dispatched to various other functions without having to specify the exact function being called. Overloading allows multiple functions taking different types to be defined with the same name; the compiler or interpreter automatically ensures that the right function is called. This way, functions appending lists of integers, lists of strings, lists of real numbers, and so on could be written, and all be called &quot;append&quot;—and the right &quot;append&quot; function would be called based on the type of lists being appended. This differs from parametric polymorphism, in which the function would need to be written &quot;generically&quot;, to work with any kind of list. Using overloading, it is possible to have a function perform two completely different things based on the type of input passed to it; this is not possible with parametric polymorphism (but would have to be achieved with switching on the type inside the generic function). Another way to look at overloading is that a routine is uniquely identified not by its name, but by the combination of its name and the number, order and types of its parameters.

This type of polymorphism is common in object-oriented programming languages, many of which allow operators to be overloaded in a manner similar to functions (see operator overloading). Some languages that are not dynamically typed and lack ad hoc polymorphism (including type classes) have longer function names such as codice_1, codice_2, etc. This can be seen as advantage (more descriptive) or a disadvantage (overly verbose) depending on one&#x27;s point of view.

An advantage that is sometimes gained from overloading is the appearance of specialization, e.g., a function with the same name can be implemented in multiple different ways, each optimized for the particular data types that it operates on. This can provide a convenient interface for code that needs to be specialized to multiple situations for performance reasons. The downside is that the type system cannot guarantee the consistency of the different implementations.

Since overloading is done at compile time, it is not a substitute for late binding as found in subtyping polymorphism.

==Late binding==
The previous section notwithstanding, there are other ways in which &quot;ad hoc&quot; polymorphism can work out. Consider for example the Smalltalk language. In Smalltalk, the overloading is done at run time, as the methods (&quot;function implementation&quot;) for each overloaded message (&quot;overloaded function&quot;) are resolved when they are about to be executed. This happens at run time, after the program is compiled. Therefore, polymorphism is given by subtyping polymorphism as in other languages, and it is also extended in functionality by &quot;ad hoc&quot; polymorphism at run time.

A closer look will also reveal that Smalltalk provides a slightly different variety of &quot;ad hoc&quot; polymorphism. Since Smalltalk has a late bound execution model, and since it provides objects the ability to handle messages that are not understood, it is possible to implement functionality using polymorphism without explicitly overloading a particular message. This may not be generally recommended practice for everyday programming, but it can be quite useful when implementing proxies.

Also, while in general terms common class method and constructor overloading is not considered polymorphism, there are more uniform languages in which classes are regular objects. In Smalltalk, for instance, classes are regular objects. In turn, this means messages sent to classes can be overloaded, and it is also possible to create objects that behave like classes without their classes inheriting from the hierarchy of classes. These are effective techniques that can be used to take advantage of Smalltalk&#x27;s powerful reflection capabilities. Similar arrangements are also possible in languages such as Self and Newspeak.

==Example==
Imagine an operator codice_3 that may be used in the following ways:
# codice_4
# codice_5
# codice_6
# codice_7
# codice_8
# codice_9
To handle these six function calls, four different pieces of code are needed (or three, if strings are considered to be lists of characters):
* In the first case, integer addition must be invoked.
* In the second and third cases, floating-point addition must be invoked (with type promotion, or type coercion, in the third case).
* In the fourth and fifth cases, list concatenation must be invoked.
* In the last case, string concatenation must be invoked.
Thus, the name codice_3 actually refers to three or four completely different functions. This is an example of &quot;overloading&quot; or more specifically, &quot;operator overloading&quot;.

Note the ambiguity in the string types used in the last case. Consider codice_11 in which the programmer might &quot;naturally&quot; assume addition rather than concatenation. They may expect codice_12 instead of codice_13. Overloading can therefore provide different meaning, or semantics, for an operation, as well as differing implementations.

<text>GNU Classpath is a free software implementation of the standard class library for the Java programming language. Most classes from J2SE 1.4 and 5.0 are implemented. Classpath can thus be used to run Java-based applications. GNU Classpath is a part of the GNU Project. It was originally developed in parallel with libgcj due to license incompatibilities, but later the two projects merged.

GNU Classpath was deemed a high priority project by the Free Software Foundation. When the Classpath project began, the license for the official Java implementation from Sun Microsystems did not allow distribution of any alterations. Since the inception of the Classpath project, the OpenJDK was released under the GPL and now serves as the official reference implementation for the Java platform.

== License ==

GNU Classpath is licensed under the GNU General Public License with a linking exception. This is a free software license. All code is formally owned by the Free Software Foundation, and this owner is bound by its own contractual obligations to the developers.

== Uses ==
GNU Classpath is used by many free Java runtimes (like Kaffe, SableVM, JamVM, Jikes RVM, and VMKit) because every full-featured Java virtual machine must provide an implementation of the standard class libraries.

Some other uses include:
* The GNU Compiler for Java, which is capable of compiling Java code into native standalone executables.
* GCJAppletViewer for launching Java applets from command line if they are not supported by the browser in use.
* IKVM.NET, which integrates Java with the .NET Framework
* JNode, an operating system for running Java applications. This system is written in Java and assembler only.
* Specialised virtual machines such as Jaos for integration with the Oberon programming language, and JamaicaVM for embedded systems with real-time guarantees.
* Virtual machines for distributed computing with clusters, having up to 128 processors on Myrinet.
* The IcedTea project used GNU Classpath as a replacement for proprietary elements of OpenJDK, prior to their replacement upstream.

== History ==
GNU Classpath development started in 1998 with five developers. During the history, it merged several times with other projects having similar goals (Kaffe, libgcj). In the past, GNU Classpath supplied its own virtual machine (Japhar). As Classpath was becoming a base library, shared with a lot of different projects, this virtual machine received less and less attention and is now no longer supported.

After implementing the majority of the official Java 1.4 API, the work in the project became more bug oriented rather than API coverage oriented. On October 24, 2006, the implementation of the last missing 1.4 class, HTMLWriter, was committed. The development speed (computed mathematically as the average number of the new lines of code per day) reached its highest ever in 2006.

The name GNU Classpath was originally suggested by Bradley M. Kuhn to one of the first developers, Paul Fisher. At the time, there was great concern in the Free Java implementations community about enforcement of Sun&#x27;s trademark on Java against free implementations. Kuhn suggested the name $CLASSPATH, which is the environment variable used by most Java systems to indicate where the Java libraries reside on the computer. Since $CLASSPATH often expanded to a path name that included the word &quot;java&quot; (such as codice_1), it was a way to evoke the name &quot;Java&quot; without actually saying it. Fisher and other developers didn&#x27;t like the unsightly use of the &quot;$&quot; and all capital letters and settled on &quot;Classpath&quot;.

== Development team ==
The maintainer takes care of the legal side of the project, prepares the regular project releases and does some quality management. The maintainer also grants the CVS access permissions.

GNU Classpath has no formal hierarchy. The work is done by the most technically capable, and there is no strict work division either. All code changes are first posted to the discussion list as patches where they can be opposed if needed. The project typically receives between five and eight patches per day.

The GNU Classpath library code coverage progress can be tracked against OpenJDK6 and OpenJDK7.

== Virtual machine integration ==
GNU Classpath contains classes from the official Java API namespace. Where calls to native code are necessary or highly desired, this is done from a small number of &quot;VM&quot; classes. The name of such a VM class matches the name of the class requiring native methods, plus the additional VM prefix: VMObject, VMString and so on. VM classes, stored separately from the rest of code, are package private and final. The methods of these classes contain the keyword &quot;native&quot;, indicating the necessity of the supporting native library. Such libraries are provided by the authors of a Java virtual machine, hence GNU Classpath can be connected to nearly any Java virtual machine if the sources of such virtual machine are available and can be modified.

== Support for the new language features in Java 1.5 ==
Before version 0.95, each GNU Classpath release consisted of two separate release tarballs; one that represented the state of the main development branch and another that contained the contents of a more experimental branch, supporting the additions, such as generics, enumerations and annotations, present in Java 1.5.

Since version 0.95, Java 1.5 additions like generics have been fully integrated into the main branch. The branch can be built by using the Eclipse compiler, ecj, to compile Java 1.5 source code to bytecode. In the case of GCJ, it uses ecj to perform this initial stage, then converts the bytecode to native code. From 0.95 onwards, GNU Classpath also supports compiling and running the newly GPLed open-source javac compiler using GNU Classpath and also allows the GNU Classpath class library, tools and examples to be compiled with javac itself.

== Classes from the omg.org domain ==

GNU Classpath does not accept any code that has a non-free license, or that was automatically generated from code with a non-free license. The standard Java API contains numerous classes from the omg.org domain that are normally generated from the IDL files, released by the Object Management Group. The &quot;use, but no modify&quot; license of these files counts as non-free. For this reason, the mentioned classes in the GNU Classpath project were written from scratch, using only the official printed OMG specifications. Hence this part of GNU Classpath is as free as any other code in the project.

<text>Sranan Tongo (Sranantongo, &quot;Surinamese tongue&quot;, Sranan, Surinamese Creole) is an English-based creole language from Suriname, in South America, where it is the first or second language for 519,600 Surinamese people (approximately 80% of the population). It is also spoken in the Netherlands and across the Surinamese diaspora. It is considered both an unofficial national language and a &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

Sranan Tongo developed among enslaved Africans from Central and West Africa, especially along the Caribbean coastline, after contact with English planters and indentured workers from 1651–67. Its use expanded to the Dutch colonists who took over the territory in 1667 and decided to maintain the local language as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;. Because the number of English colonists was massively reduced following the arrival of the Dutch, later additions to the language and the presence of African influences have made it distinct from other Afro-Caribbean creoles based on English.

== History ==

Sranan Tongo likely developed from an English-based pidgin, when English colonists in what was then part of the English colony of Guiana imported enslaved Africans for the plantations. The enslaved Africans, who were often from various tribes, did not have an African language in common and developed a pidgin to communicate. After the Dutch takeover in 1667, following the Treaty of Westminster (1674) (in exchange for ceding the North American eastern seaboard colony of New Netherland to the English), a substantial overlay of words were adopted from the Dutch language, making it a secondary lexifier. There were also additions from Spanish and Portuguese—some of these dating from earlier Portuguese occupation of the colony, which has preceded the arrival of the British. 

The first enslaved Africans probably spoke Gbe languages or Kikongo as their native tongues, and were bilingual for some time. In the early 18th century (1720), large numbers of Akan people (65%) from the region then called the Gold Coast were also transported to plantations in Suriname. The addition of the Akan language into early Sranan Tongo, which had already undergone a process of creolization at that time, further altered the language, causing relexification and giving the creole its own distinct form of Africanisms. As other ethnic groups, such as East Indians and Chinese, were brought to Suriname as indentured workers, Sranan Tongo became a &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

Indigenous peoples in Suriname also intermarried with enslaved Africans, adding a significant amount of their cultural influence to Sranan and Afro-Surinamese culture.

==Characteristics==
Despite having a significant number of English language words in its lexicon, the lack of contact with English speakers from the 17th century means Sranan Tongo is rarely mutually intelligible with modern English and is distinct from most other English-based creoles. The African language influences of Sranan Tongo are Gbe (Fon, Ewe, Aja, Gun, Gen (Mina), Xwelak), KiKongo, and Akan (Twi and Fante). The African influence on Sranan can be found in its grammar, morphology and phonology. Next to its idioms and idiophones in addition to its culinary, botanical, zoological, anatomical, artifactual, musical and Winti lexicon. The influence of the Cariban language, Carib - and Arawak can be found in Sranan&#x27;s botanical, zoological, musical, culinary and Winti lexicon.

Remnants of Sranan&#x27;s Portuguese-based period can still be traced in its lexical items of Portuguese origin and the Ancestral tradition of Odos. Odos Afro-Surinamese people proverbs, folk-lore and stories, passed down generationally during slavery through oral tradition in Sranan. These stories are still a part of Afro-Surinamese culture and identity, with many that can be traced back to specific regions in Central and West Africa where they originated.

===Phonology and orthography ===


Until the middle of the 20th century, most written texts in Sranan, seen at the time as a low-prestige language, used a spelling that was not standardized but based on Dutch orthography. In view of the considerable differences between the phonologies of Sranan and Dutch, this was not a satisfactory situation.

With the emergence of a movement striving for the emancipation of Sranan as a respectable language, the need for a phonology-based orthography was felt. A more suitable orthography developed as an informal consensus from the publications of linguists studying Sranan and related creoles. For every-day use, the Dutch-based spelling remained common, while some literary authors adopted (variants of) the linguistic spelling. To end this situation, the Surinamese government commissioned a committee of linguists and writers to define a standard spelling, which was adopted and came into force in 1986. This standard essentially followed the linguistic consensus. As the language is not taught in schools, while Dutch is, many speakers are not clearly aware of the principles on which this spelling is based and continue to use a Dutch-like, variant spelling.

== Modern use ==

Although the formal Dutch-based educational system repressed the use of Sranan Tongo, in the past pejoratively dismissed as (literally meaning or ), it gradually became more accepted by the establishment and wider society to speak it. During the 1980s, this language was popularized by publicly known speakers, including chairman Dési Bouterse, who often delivered national speeches in Sranan Tongo. 

Sranan Tongo remains widely used in Suriname and in Dutch urban areas populated by immigrants from Suriname. They especially use it in casual conversation, often freely mixing it with Dutch. Written code-switching between Sranan Tongo and Dutch is also common in computer-mediated communication. People often greet each other in Sranan Tongo by saying, for example, (), instead of the more formal Dutch ().

In 2021, Sranan Tongo appeared for the first time in the Eurovision Song Contest in Jeangu Macrooy&#x27;s song, &quot;Birth of a New Age&quot;.

== Literature ==

As a written language, Sranan Tongo has existed since the late 18th century. The first publication in Sranan Tongo was in 1783 by Hendrik Schouten who wrote a part Dutch, part Sranan Tongo poem, called (). The first important book was published in 1864 by Johannes King, and relates to his travels to Drietabbetje for the Moravian Church.

Early writers often used their own spelling system. An official orthography was adopted by the government of Suriname on July 15, 1986, in Resolution 4501. A few writers have used Sranan in their work, most notably the poet Henri Frans de Ziel (&quot;Trefossa&quot;), who also wrote &quot;God zij met ons Suriname&quot;, Suriname&#x27;s national anthem, whose second verse is sung in Sranan Tongo.

Other notable writers in Sranan Tongo are Eugène Drenthe, André Pakosie, Celestine Raalte, Michaël Slory, and Bea Vianen.

==Example==
Following are the Lord&#x27;s Prayer in standard and Dutch-based spelling, followed by an English translation.
===Translation===
Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins
as we forgive those who sin against us.
Save us from the time of trial, and deliver us from evil.
For the kingdom, the power,
and the glory are yours, now and for ever.
Amen.

<text>In mathematics, the projective special linear group , isomorphic to , is a finite simple group that has important applications in algebra, geometry, and number theory. It is the automorphism group of the Klein quartic as well as the symmetry group of the Fano plane. With 168 elements, PSL(2, 7) is the smallest nonabelian simple group after the alternating group A5 with 60 elements, isomorphic to .

== Definition ==

The general linear group consists of all invertible 2×2 matrices over F7, the finite field with 7 elements. These have nonzero determinant. The subgroup consists of all such matrices with unit determinant. Then is defined to be the quotient group
: SL(2, 7) / {&quot;I&quot;, −&quot;I&quot;}
obtained by identifying &quot;I&quot; and −&quot;I&quot;, where &quot;I&quot; is the identity matrix. In this article, we let &quot;G&quot; denote any group that is isomorphic to .

== Properties ==
&quot;G&quot; = has 168 elements. This can be seen by counting the possible columns; there are possibilities for the first column, then possibilities for the second column. We must divide by to force the determinant equal to one, and then we must divide by 2 when we identify &quot;I&quot; and −&quot;I&quot;. The result is .

It is a general result that is simple for (&quot;q&quot; being some power of a prime number), unless or . is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3, and is isomorphic to alternating group A4. In fact, is the second smallest nonabelian simple group, after the alternating group .

The number of conjugacy classes and irreducible representations is 6. The sizes of conjugacy classes are 1, 21, 42, 56, 24, 24. The dimensions of irreducible representations 1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8.

Character table
: formula_1
where
: formula_2

The following table describes the conjugacy classes in terms of the order of an element in the class, the size of the class, the minimum polynomial of every representative in GL(3, 2), and the function notation for a representative in PSL(2, 7). Note that the classes 7A and 7B are exchanged by an automorphism, so the representatives from GL(3, 2) and PSL(2, 7) can be switched arbitrarily.

The order of group is , this implies existence of Sylow&#x27;s subgroups of orders 3, 7 and 8. It is easy to describe the first two, they are cyclic, since any group of prime order is cyclic. Any element of conjugacy class 3&quot;A&quot;56 generates Sylow 3-subgroup. Any element from the conjugacy classes 7&quot;A&quot;24, 7&quot;B&quot;24 generates the Sylow 7-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroup is a dihedral group of order 8. It can be described as centralizer of any element from the conjugacy class 2&quot;A&quot;21. In the representation, a Sylow 2-subgroup consists of the upper triangular matrices.

This group and its Sylow 2-subgroup provide a counter-example for various normal p-complement theorems for .

== Actions on projective spaces ==

&quot;G&quot; = acts via linear fractional transformation on the projective line P1(7) over the field with 7 elements:

:formula_3

Every orientation-preserving automorphism of P1(7) arises in this way, and so can be thought of geometrically as a group of symmetries of the projective line P1(7); the full group of possibly orientation-reversing projective linear automorphisms is instead the order 2 extension , and the group of collineations of the projective line is the complete symmetric group of the points.

However, is also isomorphic to (), the special (general) linear group of 3×3 matrices over the field with 2 elements. In a similar fashion, acts on the projective plane P2(2) over the field with 2 elements — also known as the Fano plane:
: For formula_4 and formula_5

Again, every automorphism of P2(2) arises in this way, and so can be thought of geometrically as the symmetry group of
this projective plane. The Fano plane can be used to describe multiplication of octonions, so &quot;G&quot; acts on the set of octonion multiplication tables.

== Symmetries of the Klein quartic ==
The Klein quartic is the projective variety over the complex numbers C defined by the quartic polynomial
: &quot;x&quot;3&quot;y&quot; + &quot;y&quot;3&quot;z&quot; + &quot;z&quot;3&quot;x&quot; = 0.

It is a compact Riemann surface of genus , and is the only such surface for which the size of the conformal automorphism group attains the maximum of . This bound is due to the Hurwitz automorphisms theorem, which holds for all . Such &quot;Hurwitz surfaces&quot; are rare; the next genus for which any exist is , and the next after that is .

As with all Hurwitz surfaces, the Klein quartic can be given a metric of constant negative curvature and then tiled with regular (hyperbolic) heptagons, as a quotient of the order-3 heptagonal tiling, with the symmetries of the surface as a Riemannian surface or algebraic curve exactly the same as the symmetries of the tiling. For the Klein quartic this yields a tiling by 24 heptagons, and the order of &quot;G&quot; is thus related to the fact that . Dually, it can be tiled with 56 equilateral triangles, with 24 vertices, each of degree 7, as a quotient of the order-7 triangular tiling. 
Klein&#x27;s quartic arises in many fields of mathematics, including representation theory, homology theory, octonion multiplication, Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, and Stark&#x27;s theorem on imaginary quadratic number fields of class number 1.

== Mathieu group ==
 is a maximal subgroup of the Mathieu group M21; the groups M21 and M24 can be constructed as extensions of . These extensions can be interpreted in terms of the tiling of the Klein quartic, but are not realized by geometric symmetries of the tiling.

== Permutation actions ==
The group acts on various finite sets:
* In its original interpretation as , orientation-preserving linear automorphisms of the projective line P1(F7), it acts transitively on the 8 points with a stabilizer of order 21 fixing a given point. It also acts 2-transitively with stabilizer of order 3 on each pair of points; and it has two orbits on triples of points, with trivial stabilizer on each triple. (The larger group acts sharply 3-transitively.)
* Interpreted as , linear automorphisms of the Fano plane P2(F2), it acts 2-transitively on the 7 points, with stabilizer of order 24 fixing each point, and stabilizer of order 4 fixing each pair of points.
* Interpreted as automorphisms of a tiling of the Klein quartic, it acts transitively on the 24 vertices (or dually, 24 heptagons), with stabilizer of order 7 (corresponding to a rotation about the vertex/heptagon).
* Interpreted as a subgroup of the Mathieu group M21, the subgroup acts non-transitively on 21 points.

<text>The Silesian Wars () were three wars fought in the mid-18th century between Prussia (under King Frederick the Great) and Habsburg Austria (under Empress Maria Theresa) for control of the Central European region of Silesia (now in south-western Poland). The First (1740–1742) and Second (1744–1745) Silesian Wars formed parts of the wider War of the Austrian Succession, in which Prussia was a member of a coalition seeking territorial gain at Austria&#x27;s expense. The Third Silesian War (1756–1763) was a theatre of the global Seven Years&#x27; War, in which Austria in turn led a coalition of powers aiming to seize Prussian territory.

No particular event triggered the wars. Prussia cited its centuries-old dynastic claims on parts of Silesia as a &quot;casus belli&quot;, but &quot;Realpolitik&quot; and geostrategic factors also played a role in provoking the conflict. Maria Theresa&#x27;s contested succession to the Habsburg monarchy under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 provided an opportunity for Prussia to strengthen itself relative to regional rivals such as Saxony and Bavaria.

All three wars are generally considered to have ended in Prussian victories, and the first resulted in Austria&#x27;s cession of the majority of Silesia to Prussia. Prussia emerged from the Silesian Wars as a new European great power and the leading state of Protestant Germany, while Catholic Austria&#x27;s defeat by a lesser German power significantly damaged the House of Habsburg&#x27;s prestige. The conflict over Silesia foreshadowed a wider Austro-Prussian struggle for hegemony over the German-speaking peoples, which would later culminate in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.

==Context and causes==

In the early 18th century the Kingdom of Prussia&#x27;s ruling House of Hohenzollern held dynastic claims to several duchies within the Habsburg province of Silesia, a populous and prosperous region contiguous with Prussia&#x27;s core territory in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Besides its value as a source of tax revenue, industrial output and military recruits, Silesia held great geostrategic importance to multiple parties. The valley of the Upper Oder formed a natural military conduit between Brandenburg, the Kingdom of Bohemia and the Margraviate of Moravia, and whichever power held the territory could threaten its neighbours. Silesia also lay along the north-eastern frontier of the Holy Roman Empire, allowing its controller to limit the influence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and of the Russian Empire within Germany.

===Prussia&#x27;s claims===

Prussia&#x27;s claims in Silesia were based, in part, on a 1537 inheritance treaty between the Silesian Piast Duke Frederick II of Legnica and the Hohenzollern Prince-Elector JoachimII Hector of Brandenburg, whereby the Silesian Duchies of Liegnitz, Wohlau and Brieg were to pass to the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg should the Piast dynasty in Silesia become extinct. At the time, the Habsburg King FerdinandI of Bohemia (Silesia&#x27;s feudal overlord) rejected the agreement and pressed the Hohenzollerns to repudiate it. In 1603, Hohenzollern Elector JoachimIII Frederick of Brandenburg separately inherited the Silesian Duchy of Jägerndorf from his cousin, Margrave George Frederick of Brandenburg-Ansbach, and installed his second son, Johann Georg, as duke.

In the 1618 Bohemian Revolt and the ensuing Thirty Years&#x27; War, Johann Georg joined the Silesian estates in revolt against the Catholic Holy Roman Emperor FerdinandII. After the Catholic victory in the 1621 Battle of White Mountain, the Emperor confiscated Johann Georg&#x27;s duchy and refused to return it to his heirs after his death, but the Hohenzollerns of Brandenburg continued to assert themselves as the legitimate rulers of Jägerndorf. In 1675 the &quot;Great Elector&quot; Frederick William laid claim to Liegnitz, Wohlau and Brieg when the Silesian Piast line ended with the death of Duke George William of Liegnitz, but the Habsburg Emperor disregarded the Hohenzollern claims, and the lands escheated to the Bohemian crown.

In 1685, when Austria was engaged in the Great Turkish War, Emperor LeopoldI gave Great Elector Frederick William immediate control of the Silesian exclave of Schwiebus in return for military support against the Turks and the surrender of the outstanding Hohenzollern claims in Silesia. After the accession of the Great Elector&#x27;s son and successor, FrederickIII of Brandenburg, the Emperor took back control of Schwiebus in 1694, claiming that the territory had only been personally assigned to the late Great Elector for life. As a young prince, FrederickIII had secretly agreed to this repossession in return for Leopold&#x27;s payment of some of his debts, but as monarch he repudiated the agreement and reasserted the old Hohenzollern claims to Jägerndorf and the Silesian Piast heritage.

===Austrian succession===

Two generations later, the newly crowned Hohenzollern King Frederick II of Prussia formed designs on Silesia soon after succeeding to the throne in May 1740. Frederick judged that his dynasty&#x27;s claims were credible, and he had inherited from his father a large and well trained Prussian army and a healthy royal treasury. Austria was in financial distress, and its army had not been reinforced or reformed after an ignominious performance in the 1737–1739 Austro-Turkish War. The European strategic situation was favourable for an attack on Austria, as Britain and France were occupying each other&#x27;s attentions in the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, and Sweden was moving toward war with Russia. The Electors of Bavaria and Saxony also had claims against Austria and seemed likely to join in the attack. Though the Hohenzollerns&#x27; dynastic claims provided a legalistic &quot;casus belli&quot;, considerations of &quot;Realpolitik&quot; and geostrategy played the leading role in provoking the war.

An opportunity arose for Brandenburg–Prussia to press its claims when Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor CharlesVI died in October 1740 without a male heir. With the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, Charles had established his eldest daughter, Maria Theresa, as the successor to his hereditary titles. Upon his death she duly became ruler of Austria, as well as of the Bohemian and Hungarian lands within the Habsburg monarchy. During Emperor Charles&#x27;s lifetime the Pragmatic Sanction was generally acknowledged by the imperial estates, but when he died it was promptly contested by Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony.

===Moves toward war===

Frederick saw in Austria&#x27;s female succession an opportune moment for the seizure of Silesia, calling it &quot;the signal for the complete transformation of the old political system&quot; in a 1740 letter to Voltaire. He argued that the Pragmatic Sanction did not apply to Silesia, which was held by the Habsburgs as a part of the imperial demesne rather than as a hereditary possession. Frederick also argued that his father, King Frederick WilliamI, had assented to the Sanction in return for assurances of Austrian support for Hohenzollern claims on the Rhenish Duchies of Jülich and Berg, which had not yet materialised.

Meanwhile, Prince-Elector Charles Albert of Bavaria and Prince-Elector Frederick AugustusII of Saxony had each married one of Maria Theresa&#x27;s older cousins from a senior branch of the House of Habsburg, and they used these connections to justify claims to Habsburg territory in the absence of a male heir. Frederick Augustus, who ruled the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth in personal union, was especially interested in gaining control of Silesia to connect his two realms into one contiguous territory (which would nearly surround Brandenburg); Frederick&#x27;s concern to prevent this outcome contributed to his haste in moving against Austria when the contested succession provided an opportunity.

===Methods and technologies===

European warfare in the early modern period was characterised by the widespread adoption of firearms in combination with more traditional bladed weapons. 18th-century European armies were built around units of massed infantry armed with smoothbore flintlock muskets and bayonets. Cavalrymen were equipped with sabres and pistols or carbines; light cavalry were used principally for reconnaissance, screening and tactical communications, while heavy cavalry were used as tactical reserves and deployed for shock attacks. Smoothbore artillery provided fire support and played the leading role in siege warfare. Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key fortifications positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, lengthy sieges being a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare, though they played a larger part in Frederick&#x27;s theory of warfare than was typical among his contemporary rivals.

The Silesian Wars, like most European wars of the 18th century, were fought as so-called cabinet wars in which disciplined regular armies were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign&#x27;s interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century. Military logistics was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised magazines and distributed by baggage trains that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids. Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established winter quarters in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring.

==First Silesian War==


After Emperor Charles&#x27;s death on 20 October 1740, Frederick quickly resolved to strike first; on 8November he ordered the mobilisation of the Prussian army, and on 11 December he issued an ultimatum to Maria Theresa demanding the cession of Silesia. In return, he offered to guarantee all other Habsburg possessions against any attack, pay a large cash indemnity, acknowledge the Pragmatic Sanction, and give his vote as elector of Brandenburg to Maria Theresa&#x27;s husband, Duke Francis Stephen of Lorraine, in the forthcoming imperial election to replace the deceased Charles.

Not waiting for a response and without a declaration of war, he led Prussian troops across the lightly defended Silesian frontier on 16 December, beginning the First Silesian War. By the end of January 1741 almost the entirety of Silesia was under Prussian control, and the remaining Austrian strongholds of Glogau, Brieg and Neisse were besieged. In late March an Austrian force relieved the siege of Neisse, but the main Prussian force engaged and defeated it in the Battle of Mollwitz on 10 April, securing Prussian control of the region.

Seeing Austria&#x27;s defeat at Mollwitz, other powers were emboldened to attack the beleaguered monarchy, widening the conflict into what would become the War of the Austrian Succession. As Bavaria, Saxony, France, Naples and Spain attacked Austria on multiple fronts during the succeeding months, Frederick began secret peace negotiations with Maria Theresa, with British urging and mediation; on 9October Austria and Prussia agreed to a secret armistice known as the Convention of Klein Schnellendorf, under which Austria committed to eventually concede Lower Silesia in return for peace.

As Austria concentrated its forces against its other enemies and gained ground in the wider war, Frederick concluded that the Austrians did not intend to honour the Convention and concede territory in Silesia. To press Austria further, he repudiated the armistice and renewed offensive operations of his own. In December 1741 Prussian forces advanced into Moravia, occupying the capital at Olmütz, and besieged the fortress at Glatz on the edge of Bohemia. In January 1742 Elector Charles Albert of Bavaria won the 1742 Imperial election and became Holy Roman Emperor. In February Frederick organised a joint advance through Moravia toward Vienna with the Saxons and French, but Prussia&#x27;s allies were reluctant and uncooperative, and the campaign was abandoned in April, after which the Prussians withdrew into Bohemia and Upper Silesia.

An Austrian counter-advance into Bohemia engaged Frederick&#x27;s Prussians on 17 May and was narrowly defeated at the resulting Battle of Chotusitz. This defeat left Austria with no immediate means of driving its enemies out of Bohemia, and renewed peace talks with Prussia began in Breslau. Under British pressure, Austria agreed to cede to Prussia the large majority of Silesia, along with the County of Glatz in Bohemia, while Austria would retain two small portions of the extreme southern end of Silesia, including the Duchy of Teschen and parts of the Duchies of Jägerndorf, Troppau and Neisse. Prussia also agreed to take on some of Austria&#x27;s debts and to remain neutral for the remainder of the ongoing war. This peace agreement was adopted with the Treaty of Breslau, which ended the First Silesian War on 11 June 1742, and was later formalised in the Treaty of Berlin.

==Second Silesian War==


Peace with Prussia allowed the Austrians and their British–Hanoverian allies to reverse the gains made by the French and Bavarians in 1741. By mid 1743 Austria recovered control of Bohemia, drove the French back across the Rhine, and occupied Bavaria. In September 1743 Britain, Austria and Savoy–Sardinia concluded a new alliance under the Treaty of Worms, which led Frederick to suspect that Maria Theresa meant to retake Silesia as soon as the war elsewhere was concluded. So, on 7August 1744 Prussia declared its intervention in the ongoing conflict on behalf of Emperor Charles Albert, and Frederick led soldiers across the frontier into Bohemia on 15 August, beginning the Second Silesian War.

Prussian forces converged upon Prague, seizing the city on 16 September, and this new threat drew the Austrian army back from France through Bavaria. The French failed to harass and disrupt the Austrian redeployment, so Austria&#x27;s army was able to return to Bohemia quickly and at full strength. Frederick gathered his forces around Prague and tried to force a decisive engagement, but Austrian commander Otto Ferdinand von Traun focused on harassing the invaders&#x27; supply lines, eventually forcing the Prussians to abandon Bohemia and retreat into Upper Silesia in November.

With the January 1745 Treaty of Warsaw, Austria established a new &quot;Quadruple Alliance&quot; between Austria, Britain, Saxony and the Dutch Republic. Meanwhile, Emperor Charles Albert died on 20 January, destroying the rationale behind Frederick&#x27;s alliance. Austria renewed its offensive against Bavaria in March 1745, decisively defeating the Franco-Bavarian army at the 15 April Battle of Pfaffenhofen, and making peace with MaximilianIII of Bavaria (the son of the late Emperor Charles Albert) by the Treaty of Füssen on 22 April.
Having defeated Bavaria, Austria began an invasion of Silesia. At the end of May an Austrian–Saxon army crossed through the Giant Mountains into Silesia, only to be surprised and decisively defeated by Frederick in the Battle of Hohenfriedberg on 4June, removing any immediate prospect of Austria recovering Silesia. The Prussians followed the retreating Austrian–Saxon army into Bohemia, encamping along the Elbe while Frederick pursued a peace agreement. During the following months Maria Theresa won the support of enough prince-electors to see her husband named Holy Roman Emperor FrancisI on 13 September in Frankfurt, achieving one of her major goals in the war.

On 29 September the Austrians attacked Frederick&#x27;s camp in Bohemia, resulting in a Prussian victory at the Battle of Soor, despite the Austrian surprise and superior numbers. Soon low supplies forced the Prussians to withdraw into Upper Silesia for the winter. In November Austria and Saxony prepared a surprise double invasion of Brandenburg, hoping to seize Berlin and end the war outright. On 23 November Frederick surprised the Austrian invaders in the Battle of Hennersdorf, confusing and scattering the larger Austrian force. Meanwhile, another Prussian army under LeopoldI of Anhalt-Dessau advanced into western Saxony, attacking and destroying the main Saxon army in the Battle of Kesselsdorf on 15 December, after which the Prussians occupied Dresden.

In Dresden the belligerents quickly negotiated a peace treaty, under which Maria Theresa acknowledged Prussian control of Silesia and Glatz, while Frederick recognised FrancisI as Holy Roman Emperor and again committed to neutrality for the remainder of the War of the Austrian Succession. For its part in the Austrian alliance, Saxony was compelled to pay one million rixdollars in reparations to Prussia. The region&#x27;s borders were thus confirmed at the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, which had been Prussia&#x27;s principal goal. This Treaty of Dresden was signed on 25 December 1745, ending the Second Silesian War between Austria, Saxony and Prussia.

==Interbellum==

After Prussia&#x27;s withdrawal the wider War of the Austrian Succession continued for another two years, ending with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. Despite the commitments made under the Treaty of Dresden, Maria Theresa still refused to give the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s recognition of Prussia&#x27;s sovereignty in Silesia, and Frederick in turn still declined to recognise Maria Theresa&#x27;s legitimacy as sovereign in the Bohemian lands under the Pragmatic Sanction. The underlying conflict over Silesia was unresolved, and both sides spent the years of peace making preparations for renewed conflict.

Prussia built and expanded fortifications at strategic points in Silesia, and the army began to reequip its artillery units with heavier guns. The crown established Prussia&#x27;s first central bank, and the treasury gathered its surpluses into a growing war chest throughout the peace. In diplomacy, Frederick worked to maintain Prussia&#x27;s alliance with France while easing British concerns over the security of the Electorate of Hanover, which British King GeorgeII also ruled in personal union. By these means, and by avoiding any provocations toward Russia, he hoped to manage the Austrian threat and preserve the balance of power.

After the Treaty of Dresden, Maria Theresa initiated a wave of so-called Theresian reforms of Austria&#x27;s administration and military, as well as ordering a review of her government&#x27;s diplomatic policy. Her Chancellor Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz oversaw a dramatic reform of the realm&#x27;s systems of taxation, which funded a significant expansion of Austria&#x27;s field armies. Field Marshal Leopold Joseph von Daun standardised the army&#x27;s equipment and professionalised its training, drawing on the Prussian model. In 1746 Maria Theresa entered a defensive pact with Empress Elizabeth of Russia that aligned their two realms against Prussia. Beginning in 1753 Foreign Minister Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz pursued warmer relations with Austria&#x27;s traditional rival, the Kingdom of France. In 1756 these efforts led Austria to abandon its alliance with Britain in favour of a new Franco-Austrian alliance, while Prussia and Britain entered a defensive alliance by the Convention of Westminster, completing a diplomatic reordering of the European powers known as the Diplomatic Revolution.

==Third Silesian War==


As Austria, France and Russia formed a new anti-Prussian coalition, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked in early 1757 and once again chose to strike first. On 29 August 1756 he preemptively invaded neighbouring Saxony, beginning the Third Silesian War. As Austria&#x27;s and Prussia&#x27;s allies joined the fighting, the conflict quickly widened into what became the pan-European Seven Years&#x27; War. The Prussians occupied Saxony in late 1756 and made large advances in Bohemia in early 1757, winning a series of battles while advancing to Prague. In May Prussian forces drove back the Austrian defenders in the Battle of Prague, taking great losses, and then besieged the city. An Austrian counter-attack culminated in the major Austrian victory at the Battle of Kolín on 18 June, which drove the Prussians out of Bohemia entirely. Meanwhile, Russian and Swedish invasions from the east and north divided Prussia&#x27;s forces. The Russian invaders in East Prussia won the Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August, but they made little strategic progress due to recurring logistical problems.

In late 1757 Imperial and French forces attempted to retake Saxony from the west, only to experience a decisive defeat in the Battle of Rossbach on 5November. This battle secured Prussia&#x27;s control of Saxony for a time, and the defeat greatly reduced French willingness to contribute further to the Silesian War. Another Austrian army invaded Silesia, making significant progress until it was decisively defeated at the Battle of Leuthen on 5December, after which the Prussians pursued the defeated Austrian army back to Bohemia and recovered control of nearly all of Silesia. Over the winter a combined Prussian-Hanoverian army launched a series of offensives that eventually drove the French out of Westphalia and across the Rhine, securing Prussia&#x27;s western flank for the duration of the war.
In mid-1758 Prussia invaded Moravia, besieging Olmütz in late May. The city was well defended, and by late June the Prussians&#x27; supplies were exhausted. Austrians intercepted and destroyed a major Prussian supply convoy on 30 June in the Battle of Domstadtl, and the invaders abandoned the siege, retreating into Upper Silesia. Russian forces advanced through East Prussia to threaten Brandenburg, fighting the Prussians to a costly draw on 25 August at the Battle of Zorndorf. An Austrian army advancing into Saxony made little progress, despite winning a substantial victory at the Battle of Hochkirch on 14 October.

In 1759 a united Austrian and Russian advance into eastern Brandenburg culminated in a major Prussian defeat at the Battle of Kunersdorf on 12 August, but the victorious allies did not pursue the defeated Prussians or occupy the Prussian capital at Berlin. After Kunersdorf Frederick had briefly believed the war totally lost, but the coalition&#x27;s internal conflicts and hesitant leadership gave Prussia a second chance, an event that Frederick later termed the &quot;Miracle of the House of Brandenburg&quot;. The succeeding months saw the Austrians retake Dresden and most of Saxony, with intermittent skirmishing in Saxony continuing into the next year.

In 1760 the Austrians advanced into Lower Silesia, where the Prussian and Austrian armies manoeuvred against each other for some time before engaging in the Battle of Liegnitz on 15 August; the battle ended in a solid Prussian victory, disrupting the Austrians&#x27; advance and restoring Prussian control of Lower Silesia. In late 1760 the Russians and Austrians briefly occupied Berlin, and on 3November the main Prussian and Austrian armies fought the Battle of Torgau, a narrow Prussian victory that proved costly for both sides. The year 1761 saw little activity by the exhausted Prussian and Austrian forces, but Russian forces made advances in Pomerania and eastern Brandenburg that threatened a decisive end to the war the following year.

In January 1762, Austria was suddenly abandoned by its Russian ally upon the death of Empress Elizabeth. She was succeeded by the ardently pro-Prussian Peter III of Russia, who immediately recalled his armies from Berlin and Pomerania and made peace with Prussia by the Treaty of Saint Petersburg on 5May. Peter was overthrown and assassinated within months, but by then the war had again shifted in Prussia&#x27;s favour, and Russia did not resume hostilities. Both sides were nearing exhaustion, and peace talks to end the wider Seven Years&#x27; War began in late 1762. In the end, negotiators agreed again on a return to the &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;, confirming Prussia&#x27;s control of Silesia in the Treaty of Hubertusburg in February 1763. Prussia also committed to support the election of Maria Theresa&#x27;s son, Archduke Joseph, as Holy Roman Emperor.

==Outcomes==

The Silesian Wars ended in Prussian victory over Austria, a view universal among contemporaries and broadly supported by historiography since. Prussia seized and defended a long-held Habsburg territory, and the &quot;status quo ante&quot; outcomes of the second and third wars confirmed this basic fact. These conflicts provoked a broad realignment in the European diplomatic system of the time, establishing an Austria–Prussia rivalry that would define German politics for a century until after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.

===Prussia===

Prussia&#x27;s unexpected victory over the Habsburg monarchy set it apart from German rivals such as Bavaria and Saxony, marking Prussia&#x27;s rise to the status of a European great power, as well as the leading power of Protestant Germany. The kingdom had gained some of new territory and around a million new subjects in Glatz and Silesia, a populous and densely industrialised region that would contribute substantial manpower and taxes to the Prussian state. Geostrategically, Silesia also gave Prussia a threatening position with respect to Saxony and Austria and a strong defence against encirclement by Poland. Frederick&#x27;s personal reputation was enormously enhanced by his successes in the wars, winning him the epithet &quot;Frederick the Great&quot;. His debts to fortune (Russia&#x27;s about-face after Elizabeth&#x27;s death) and to British financial support were soon forgotten, while the memories of his energetic leadership and tactical genius were strenuously promoted. His small kingdom had defeated the Habsburg monarchy and defended its prize against Austria, Britain, Saxony, Russia, Sweden, and France, an accomplishment that appeared miraculous to contemporary observers.

Though sometimes depicted as a key moment in Prussia&#x27;s rise to greatness, the wars nonetheless left the kingdom&#x27;s economy and population devastated, and much of the remainder of Frederick&#x27;s reign was spent repairing the damage. To mitigate population losses, the King continued his father&#x27;s policy of encouraging Protestant refugees from Catholic realms to resettle in Prussia. The repeated currency devaluations imposed to finance the conflicts led to rapid inflation and great economic disruption in Prussia (and in occupied Saxony). After the wars the state began using its network of military grain depots and the excise on grain to stabilise food prices and alleviate grain shortages. Prussia also established a rudimentary social welfare system for impoverished and disabled veterans of the Silesian Wars.

Prussia&#x27;s armed forces experienced heavy casualties in the wars, and the officer corps was severely depleted. After the peace of Hubertusburg the state had neither the money nor the manpower to rebuild the army to what it had been at Frederick&#x27;s accession. In the succeeding War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779) the Prussians fought poorly, despite again being personally led by Frederick, and the Prussian army did not fare well against revolutionary France in 1792–1795. In 1806 the Prussians were shattered by Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée at the Battle of Jena; only after a series of reforms motivated by the disasters of 1806–1807 did Prussian military power again begin to grow.

===Austria===

The defeats of the Silesian Wars cost the Habsburg monarchy its wealthiest province, and capitulating to a lesser German prince significantly dented the House of Habsburg&#x27;s prestige. Prussia&#x27;s confirmation as a first-rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and army were long-term threats to Austria&#x27;s hegemony in Germany. Still, by winning Prussia&#x27;s support for the Imperial elections of her husband and son, Maria Theresa ensured the continuation of her family&#x27;s titular pre-eminence in the Holy Roman Empire, though this was far less than she had hoped for. Defeat in the first two Silesian Wars at the hands of an enemy so apparently inferior created a strong impetus for change within the Habsburg monarchy, resulting in the first wave of Theresian reforms: a broad restructuring of the Habsburg administration and military, and a total realignment of Habsburg foreign policy through the &quot;Diplomatic Revolution&quot;.

After the renewed disappointment of the Third Silesian War, a second wave of Theresian reforms ensued. In 1761 the Habsburg monarchy implemented newly centralised administrative and policymaking bodies to streamline what had often been a chaotic executive process. The 1760s and 1770s saw vigorous efforts to improve tax collection, particularly in the Duchy of Milan and the Austrian Netherlands, which led to significant increases in state revenues. In 1766 the crown promulgated its first common code of laws, the &quot;Codex Theresianus&quot;, in an effort to unify the realm&#x27;s legal systems. Aiming to increase the peasantry&#x27;s ability to contribute to the state&#x27;s tax base, Maria Theresa issued a series of Robot Patents between 1771 and 1778 restricting forced peasant labour in her German and Bohemian lands, and her son would carry the process further with his Serfdom Patent. The state also implemented compulsory primary education and established a system of secular public schools. Beginning with these steps, wide-ranging efforts to modernise the Habsburg monarchy over the next half century grew out of Austria&#x27;s defeats, culminating in the Josephinism of the 1780s.

<text>The Haunted Mansion is a 2003 American supernatural horror comedy film directed by Rob Minkoff and written by David Berenbaum. Loosely based on Walt Disney&#x27;s theme park attraction of the same name, the film stars Eddie Murphy as a realtor who, along with his family, becomes trapped in the titular building. Terence Stamp, Wallace Shawn, Marsha Thomason and Jennifer Tilly appear in supporting roles.

The film was theatrically released in the United States on November 26, 2003, by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. The film received negative reviews from critics but performed well at the box office, grossing $182.3 million worldwide against a $90 million budget. A reboot directed by Justin Simien was later released in 2023, 20 years after the film&#x27;s release.

==Plot==
In Louisiana, Jim and Sara Evers are successful realtors with a pair of children, Michael and Megan. However, Jim&#x27;s workaholic lifestyle causes him to miss his wedding anniversary. When he tries to make amends by suggesting a vacation to the nearby lake, Sara is suddenly contacted by the residents of Gracey Manor, located in the nearby bayou; Jim, eager to make a deal after learning the mansion&#x27;s address, takes his family there and meet its owner, Edward Gracey, his butler Ramsley and his other servants – maid Emma and footman Ezra.

When a rainstorm floods the nearby river, Gracey lets the family stay at the mansion for the night. Ramsley takes Jim to the library to discuss the deal with Gracey, but Jim becomes trapped in a secret passage. Gracey gives Sara a tour of the mansion, discussing his past and the death of his &quot;grandfather&quot; after the supposed suicide of his lover, Elizabeth Henshaw. Megan and Michael follow a spectral orb to the attic and find a painting of a woman resembling Sara. Emma and Ezra soon appear and identify the woman as the late Elizabeth.

Meanwhile, Jim meets Madame Leota, the ghost of a gypsy whose head is encased in her crystal ball. He runs into Emma, Ezra and his children and returns to Leota for answers about Elizabeth&#x27;s likeness to Sara. It is revealed that the mansion&#x27;s inhabitants are ghosts, cursed a century ago by Elizabeth&#x27;s and Gracey&#x27;s untimely deaths, and can only enter the afterlife when the lovers are reunited; Sara is believed to be Elizabeth&#x27;s reincarnation. Leota sends the Evers to the mansion&#x27;s cemetery to find a key that will reveal the truth about Elizabeth&#x27;s death. In a crypt beneath a mausoleum, Jim and Megan find the key, but inadvertently disturb its undead occupants. The duo narrowly escape with help from Michael, who overcomes his arachnophobia when they are locked in.

Leota leads them to a locked trunk in the attic, in which Jim finds a letter Elizabeth wrote to Gracey, revealing she truly wanted to marry him and indicating that she was murdered. Ramsley then appears and reveals that he murdered Elizabeth to prevent Gracey from abandoning his heritage, as he believed their relationship was unacceptable. To hide the truth, Ramsley traps the children in another trunk and literally throws Jim out of the mansion. As Gracey and Sara rendezvous in the ballroom, she is confused when he asks if she recognizes him and insists she is Elizabeth. The room then fills with dancing ghosts as Gracey reveals his true colors, but Sara denies being Elizabeth and flees to her room. Gracey starts to have doubts, but Ramsley insists that Sara &quot;is&quot; Elizabeth and will eventually remember as he then blackmails Sara into marrying Gracey in exchange for her children&#x27;s safety.

Encouraged by Leota, Jim manages to re-enter the mansion, saves his children and stop the wedding. He then gives Gracey Elizabeth&#x27;s letter and Ramsley&#x27;s crimes are exposed. Furious, Gracey confronts Ramsley, who rages at his master&#x27;s apparent selfishness for loving Elizabeth and summons wraiths to attack the group. However, with the truth revealed, the demon Mephisto emerges from the ballroom&#x27;s fireplace and drags Ramsley down to Hell to face eternal punishment for his sins. Ramsley attempts to take Jim with him, but he is fortunately saved by Gracey. Sara collapses, having been poisoned by Ramsley during the wedding ceremony, but the spectral orb appears and, possessing Sara, is revealed to be Elizabeth, who could only be released from her current form once the truth was revealed. She and Gracey then reunite as Sara is subsequently revived.

With the curse lifted, Gracey gives the Evers the deed to the mansion and departs to Heaven with Elizabeth and the mansion&#x27;s inhabitants. Afterwards, the Evers set off for their intended vacation, accompanied by Leota and a quartet of singing busts that Jim and the children encountered while locating the mausoleum strapped to the roof.

In a post-credits scene, Leota encourages the audience to return using the same lines from the finale of the film&#x27;s source material.

==Cast==
* Eddie Murphy as Jim Evers, a successful yet workaholic real estate agent who is often late for family gatherings, but tries his best to make up for it. 
* Terence Stamp as Ramsley, the ghost of Gracey Manor&#x27;s butler who serves as a father figure to Master Gracey. He is later revealed to be responsible for Elizabeth&#x27;s death.
* Nathaniel Parker as Master Edward Gracey, the ghost of Gracey Manor&#x27;s owner who longs for his lost love, Elizabeth Henshaw, to return to him after her apparent suicide.
* Marsha Thomason as Sara Evers, Jim&#x27;s disapproving wife who is also his business partner. Thomason also portrays Elizabeth Henshaw, the ghost of Master Gracey&#x27;s long lost lover who bears a striking resemblance to Sara. The latter is loosely based on the source material&#x27;s bride characters.
* Jennifer Tilly as Madame Leota, the ghost of a Romani woman whose head is encased in her crystal ball.
* Wallace Shawn as Ezra, the ghost of a bumbling footman who worries about getting into trouble.
* Dina Spybey as Emma, the ghost of a nervous but helpful maid who seems terrified of Ramsley.
* Marc John Jefferies as Michael Evers, Jim and Sara&#x27;s arachnophobic son.
* Aree Davis as Megan Evers, Jim and Sara&#x27;s impatient daughter.
* The Dapper Dans as the voices of the Singing Busts. The busts appear as a quartet rather than a quintet as seen in the source material.
* Deep Roy, Jeremy Howard and Clay Martinez as the Hitchhiking Ghosts.
* Corey Burton as the voice of the Ghost Host. Burton voiced the Ghost Host as a tribute to Paul Frees who played the character in the ride.
* Rachael Harris as Mrs. Coleman

The film&#x27;s chief makeup artist Rick Baker appears in the graveyard scene as a ghost behind a tombstone, using an appearance based on a portrait of the Ghost Host seen in the attraction. The cast also includes an uncredited Martin Klebba as Pickwick, one the ghosts in the graveyard, albeit unnamed and only credited as &quot;Happy Ghost&quot; and director Rob Minkoff&#x27;s nephew, who appears as the paperboy in the opening scene.

==Production==

In January 2002, it was announced Disney had formally greenlit &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; with the script written by David Berenbaum.

The original concept for the film&#x27;s setting was Upstate New York, with the mansion&#x27;s exterior modeled after the Walt Disney World version. However, to keep the faithfulness of the original attraction&#x27;s location in the New Orleans Square section of Disneyland, the producers changed the setting to New Orleans, Louisiana. To allude to the two versions of the attraction and create a more foreboding atmosphere, the production enlarged the film mansion, basing its designs on the original attraction while adding the iron and glass conservatory on its side from the Florida version of the ride. Director Rob Minkoff described the film&#x27;s mansion&#x27;s architecture as Renaissance-influenced with a mix of antebellum and Dutch-colonial revival style.

The mansion scenes were filmed at Sable Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. The main building was constructed over a period of weeks while the cupola and chimneys on the top of the mansion were computer-generated. The rest of film was shot in New Orleans and surrounding areas.

Five Hidden Mickeys are seen throughout the film similar to the ride; the most notable ones being the padlock at the mansion&#x27;s gates, the second when an axe wielded by an animated suit of armor nearly hits Jim, and a third which is briefly seen when Ramsley poisons a goblet of wine during the wedding ceremony. Two other hidden mickeys are the couch in the library and the windows on the doors Jim passes when he is chased by musical instruments summoned by Madame Leota. Before leaving the mansion via a hearse to find the mausoleum, Ezra exclaims &quot;there&#x27;s always my way,&quot; a pivotal line of dialogue from the attraction.

The costume and special effects designers wanted the ghost characters to become &quot;more dead&quot; the farther they were from the mansion. While Ezra and Emma look human in the house, their leaving it causes them to become blue and transparent to show they are ghosts. The zombies in the mausoleum were described as the &quot;deadest as they are farthest away&quot;. Rick Baker, the chief costume designer, did the prosthetic makeup for the zombies in the mausoleum, using skull heads for the zombie design. He also designed one of the zombies as an elderly man holding a cane in order for the mausoleum scene not to be too frightening to viewers.

==Music==
The music for The Haunted Mansion was composed by Mark Mancina who had previously worked on music for Disney animated films such as The Lion King and Tarzan. Mark used an original score for the film, but also briefly used the original attraction&#x27;s song Grim Grinning Ghosts in the scene when Jim and his children came across the Singing Busts in the cemetery while looking for the mausoleum.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; grossed $24.3 million on its opening weekend with an average of $7,776 per theatre in the United States. With a final domestic gross at $75.8 million, the film made just more than a quarter of the earnings of its theme-ride predecessor &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;. The film achieved better in other markets, with an international total of $106.4 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval percentage of 13% based on 142 reviews and a rating of 4.30 out of 10. The critics consensus reads: &quot;Neither scary nor funny, &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; is as lifeless as the ghosts in the movie.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 34 out of 100 based on 34 critic reviews, meaning &quot;Generally Unfavorable&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

David Sterritt of Christian Science Monitor wrote &quot;While it may supply giggles and shivers to preteens, grownups should think twice before entering this all-too-haunted house.&quot; Roger Ebert in &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two and a half stars out of a possible four, writing &quot;The surprising thing about &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s based on a Disney theme park ride, but that it has ambition. It wants to be more than a movie version of the ride. I expected an inane series of nonstop action sequences, but what I got was a fairly intriguing story and an actual plot that is actually resolved. That doesn&#x27;t make the movie good enough to recommend, but it makes it better than the ads suggest.&quot; In one of the film&#x27;s positive reviews, Sheri Linden of Hollywood Reporter called the film &quot;A pleasant and atmospheric family romp, offering enough mildly chilling thrills to keep everyone entertained during its brief running time.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Although considered a critical failure and a decent box office success upon its release, &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; has undergone a reassessment over the past several years. Like &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), &quot;The Monster Squad&quot; (1987), and &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; (1993), all similar dark-yet-broadly-comical films that initially opened to poor reviews and disappointing box office results before growing an appreciative audience over time, &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; has grown in popularity since its original theatrical run and has achieved cult status, as noted by media outlets such as Insider Inc. and Full Circle Cinema.

Author and Disney historian Jeff Baham attributes the film&#x27;s increased popularity to its original intended audience — the pre-teens and teens who saw it during its initial release and subsequent home video release — who have grown up with an appreciation for the film, and who now, as adults, are introducing it to their own children:

On episode 35 of the Doombuggies podcast, published May 13, 2022, and entitled &quot;The Haunted Mansion Movies&quot;, Baham expands on this:

&quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; is now a popular Halloween movie and is regularly featured on Halloween season cable programming blocks such as Freeform&#x27;s &quot;31 Nights of Halloween&quot;. The film also appears on many lists of &quot;Best Halloween Movies&quot; (especially the youth-centric lists) including those of &quot;Elle&quot;, Country Living, &quot;Today&quot;, We Got This Covered, Woman’s Day, Redbook, Good Housekeeping, The Hollywood Reporter, and others.

In January 2023, Eddie Murphy was critical about the film: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t very good&quot;.

In October 2023 to celebrate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, many crew members who worked on the film including director Rob Minkoff, screenwriter David Berenbaum, costume designer Mona May, composer Mark Mancina and cast member Nathaniel Parker reunited by participating in a livestream on YouTube on &quot;The Tammy Tuckey Show&quot;. The event had been organised ahead of time.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and DVD on April 20, 2004. The film was released on Blu-Ray on October 17, 2006.

==Reboot==

In July 2010, it was announced that a reboot adaptation based on Disney&#x27;s The Haunted Mansion was in development for Walt Disney Pictures, with Guillermo del Toro as writer and producer. The film remained in development until Ryan Gosling entered early negotiations to star in April 2015, while D.V. DeVincentis was hired to rewrite the script. In September 2016, Brigham Taylor was hired as an additional producer.

In August 2020, it was announced that writer Katie Dippold would write a new screenplay, and that Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich would co-produce. Justin Simien signed on as director in April 2021, and Tiffany Haddish, Lakeith Stanfield, Owen Wilson, Rosario Dawson, and Danny DeVito had all signed on to star by October that same year. The film was released on July 28, 2023.

<doc id="390441" wikidata="Q1550301" url="?curid=390441" title="Lemon meringue pie">
<text>Lemon meringue pie is a dessert pie consisting of a shortened pastry base filled with lemon curd and topped with meringue.

== History ==

Fruit desserts covered with baked meringue were found beginning in the 18th century in France. Menon&#x27;s &quot;pommes meringuées&quot; are a sort of thick apple sauce or apple butter covered with baked meringue in his 1739 cookbook. A custard flavored with &quot;citron&quot; (probably a mistranslation of &#x27;lemon&#x27;) and covered with baked meringue, &quot;crême meringuée&quot;, was published by 1769 in English, apparently a translation of an earlier edition of Menon (1755?). Similar recipes cooked in a crust appear in 19th century America: apple pie covered with meringue, called &#x27;apple a la turque&#x27; (1832) and &#x27;apples meringuées&#x27; (1846). A generic &#x27;meringue pie&#x27; based on any pie was documented in 1860. The name &#x27;Lemon Meringue Pie&#x27; appears in 1869, but lemon custard pies with meringue topping were often simply called lemon cream pie. In literature one of the first references to this dessert can be found in the book &#x27;Memoir and Letters of Jenny C. White Del Bal&#x27; by Rhoda E. White, published in 1868. A chocolate meringue variant exists.

==Preparation==
A stiff lemon-flavored custard is prepared with egg yolks, lemon zest and juice, sugar, and sometimes starch and baked in a pie crust. Uncooked meringue, usually shaped into peaks, is spread over the top, sometimes with a sprinkle of sugar, and briefly baked.

<text>Bielsk Podlaski (, , ) is a town in eastern Poland, within Bielsk County in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 24,883.

==Geography==
Bielsk Podlaski is located in the geographical region of Europe known as the Podlasie-Belarus Plateau (Polish: &quot;Wysoczyzny Podlasko-Białoruskie&quot;) and the mesoregion known as the Bielsk plain (Polish: &quot;Równina Bielska&quot;).

The town covers an area of .

===Location===
It is located approximately northeast of Warsaw, the capital of Poland and southwest of Białystok, the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship.

==History==

Bielsk Podlaski has a long and rich history, dating back to the 12th century, when this area of Poland belonged to Kievan Rus&#x27;. The gord of Bielsk was probably founded by Ruthenian dukes, and its existence was first mentioned in 1253, in the so-called Hypatian Codex. In 1273, Bielsk was captured by Lithuanian duke Traidenis, and in the early 14th century, whole province of Podlasie became annexed by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The region was subject to Teutonic Knights raids, which took place in 1346 and 1379.

In 1382, Masovian Duke Janusz I of Warsaw captured Bielsk, Drohiczyn, Suraż and Mielnik, taking advantage of the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–84). Next year, Jogaila pushed the Mazovians out of Bielsko, handing the gord over to Vytautas (Witold). In 1390, Jogaila, who had become King of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło, handed Bielsk, Suraż, Drohiczyn and Mielnik over to Janusz I.

Due to its convenient location along a merchant route from Kraków to Vilnius, Bielsk became an important center of trade and administration. In late November 1412, it was visited by King Władysław II Jagiełło, and 1413, the Land of Drohiczyn, together with Bielsk, became part of Trakai Voivodeship. In 1430, Duke Vytautas named first vogt of Bielsko, a man named Andrzej. A number of Poles from Mazovia begin to settle in Podlasie.

Bielsk received its Magdeburg rights town charter on 18 November 1495, from King Alexander I Jagiellon. In September 1501, a meeting of Lithuanian nobility took place here. Several Polish rulers visited Bielsk, such as Władysław II Jagiełło, Alexander I (1505), Sigismund I the Old (1506, 1509), and Sigismund II Augustus (1564). In 1513, Bielsk was named capital of the newly created Podlaskie Voivodeship; by 1563, the town had 830 houses, and was also main center of the Land of Bielsko.

In early summer of 1564, when king Sigismund II Augustus stayed here with Primate Jakub Uchański, to discuss the new Polish-Lithuanian union (see Union of Lublin), the wooden castle of Bielsk burned to the ground, with the king watching the incident from the stables. A new castle for the local starosta was built in Hołowiesko (located within present-day town limits of Bielsk), while the land court was moved to Brańsk.

Following the Union of Lublin (1569), Bielsko was transferred from Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the Kingdom of Poland. Bielsk was a royal town of Poland, administratively located in the Podlaskie Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. The town prospered, with churches, hospital, mills, shops and 265 artisans (as for 1576). Bielsko burned in 1591, and Swedish invasion of Poland brought almost complete destruction (1655). The Carmelites Church in Bielsk and monastery was founded in 1641 by magnate Adam Kazanowski (starost of Bielsk from 1638) and dedicated to the Mother of God of Mount Carmel. The project was also financed by his wife Elżbieta (&quot;Halszka&quot;) Słuszczanka (around 1619-1671). The 3rd Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in Bielsk in 1792.
Following the Third Partition of Poland, Bielsk briefly belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia (1795–1807): after the Treaties of Tilsit, it was transferred to the Russian Empire. From 1843, it belonged to the Grodno Governorate. Residents of the area actively participated in the largest 19th-century Polish uprisings (November Uprising and January Uprising). Bielsk was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863-1864. Additionally, in September 1863, as punishment for supporting the uprising, Russians plundered the nearby village of Łukawica, and expelled its entire population, which was forcibly marched to Bielsk, and then deported to katorga in Siberia. Two people died during the march from Łukawica to Bielsk: an old man and a child. As part of the post-uprising anti-Polish repressions, the town was subjected to Russification, the local Catholic church was closed down, and Polish clergy was also deported to Siberia. Edward Kiersnowski, leader of a local insurgent unit, who fought in several battles in the region, died while being deported to Siberia in 1864. In 1873, Bielsk received rail connection with Brest Litovsk, and in 1915, during World War I, German troops burned the rail station. Germans retreated from the town in February 1919, and were replaced by Polish Army units. In late July 1920, during the Polish-Soviet War, Bielsk was briefly occupied by the Red Army. In the Second Polish Republic, Bielsk administratively belonged to the Białystok Voivodeship.
During the 1939 joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the town was captured by the Wehrmacht, which on 23 September handed it over to the Soviets, who occupied it until 23 June 1941, forcibly sending thousands to Siberia. In 1941-1944, the town was occupied by Nazi Germany. Germans murdered its Jewish minority, and in a nearby forest killed approximately 800 Poles. The Germans also operated a forced labour camp in the town. A pogrom took place in Bielsk Podlaski from 5 to 7 July 1941. Between 2 and 15 November 1942, approximately 7,000 local Jews and 4,000 more from Boćki, Brańsk, Narew, Orla, Rudka, and Kleszczele (where the Jews from Milejczyce had been relocated earlier) who had been herded into Bielsk Podlaski, which became a transit ghetto for eleven to fifteen thousand Jews, were deported from the ghetto of Bielsk Podlaski to Treblinka. Bielsk was captured by the Red Army on 30 July 1944. The Russians then carried out arrests of local Polish resistance members, including 12 officers of the local command of the Home Army, who were arrested on 4 August 1944 in nearby Brańsk, where they were deceitfully gathered for a supposed formal meeting with the command of the Soviet 65th Army. The town was soon restored to Poland.

Bielsk Podlaski has a rich Jewish history which was wiped out in the Holocaust.

===Jews===
Jews appeared in Bielsk Podlaski as early as the 15th century. In 1487, King Casimir IV Jagiellon leased the customs house in Bielsk Podlaski to 2 Jews from Lutsk. The Jews residing in Bielsk Podlaski at that time did not form a community due to their small numbers (a few families). In 1542, the existence of a Jewish community in the city was confirmed. There was also a synagogue mentioned. In 1564, there were conflicts in the city between Christians and Jews, and two years later King Sigismund Augustus had to resolve this dispute: Jews were then granted new privileges. This state of affairs did not last long, however, because the censuses from 1580 and 1591 do not show any Orthodox Jews in Bielsk Podlaski, which would mean that there were no Jews in Bielsk at the turn of the 16th century. The Jewish community in Bielsk Podlaski was supposed to have existed until 1662. Jews began to flow to Bielsk again at the turn of the 18th century. In 1771, there was already a Qahal. Officially, Jews were allowed to settle in Bielsk only at the turn of 1802/1803. In 1807, a Jewish community was established, and in that year, out of the 1836 inhabitants of the city, there were 31 Jews. A year later, there were 64, and in 1816, 94 Jews. In 1861, there were 1,256 Jews living in the city and 3 houses of prayer. In 1878, out of 5,810 citizens of the city, there were already 3,968 Jews. After the 1897 census, out of 7,464 residents, there were 4,097 Jews. In 1938, they were about 38% of the total population.

The largest concentration of Jewish houses and squares in Bielsk Podlaski was located around the main market square, the central point of which was the town hall, full of Jewish shops, and on the eastern side of the market square. Jews also lived along the main streets of the city: Mickiewicza, Szkolna, Boźnicza, Waska, Widowska and Ogrodowa. The main wooden synagogue was located in the very center. There were several other houses of prayer around it, including one on Wąska Street (demolished after the war). The Jewish cemetery, old, no longer in existence, was in the city center, and the other one was on the road to Brańsk. The last rabbi to serve was Mosze Aron Bendas.

The construction of the main wooden synagogue began in place of the old one in 1898. The synagogue was named &quot;Jafe Einan&quot;. On Boznicza Street, also called &quot;Beth Midrasz Gas&quot; stood the third synagogue called &quot;Beth Midrasz Szarej Zion&quot;. It was a wooden synagogue that was built on the site of the old one, which had burned down during World War I. Next to this synagogue there was a mikveh, a Talmud Torah school, a yeshiva and an orphanage. In 1889, another wooden house of prayer was opened on Rynkova and Preczistninskaya (Puszkina) streets. It was funded by Joel Landau and Tanchiel Grodzinski.

<text>Hajnówka (; , &quot;Hajnaŭka&quot;; Podlachian: &quot;Hájnuvka&quot;; , &quot;Hachnovka&quot;) is a town and a powiat seat in eastern Poland (Podlaskie Voivodeship) with 21,442 inhabitants (2014). It is the capital of Hajnówka County. The town is also notable for its proximity to the Białowieża Forest, the biggest primaeval forest in Europe. Through Hajnówka flows the river Leśna Prawa. It is one of the centres of Orthodox faith and a notable centre of Belarusian culture in Poland.
Belarusians comprised 26.4% of the town&#x27;s population in 2002.

It is one of five Polish/Belarusian bilingual gminas in Podlaskie Voivodeship regulated by the &quot;Act of 6 January 2005 on National and Ethnic Minorities and on the Regional Languages&quot;, which permits certain gminas with significant linguistic minorities to introduce a second, auxiliary language to be used in official contexts alongside Polish.

==History==

&quot;For a more detailed history of Białowieża and the area see: Białowieża Forest&quot;

As a village, it was founded some time in the 16th century as a single house of a forest ward, by a certain Hajno, who was one of the royal officers protecting the Białowieża Forest. In 1589 whole forest became a private property of the royal court and the number of forest workers settled in the area started to grow. However, the forest protection (it was most probably the first forest reserve in the world) prevented the area from economical growth and so the village was limited to a number of wooden huts at the western end of the forest. It mostly shared the history of other similar settlements in the area, including Białowieża itself.

After the Third Partition of Poland the area was annexed by Kingdom of Prussia and Russian Empire in 1795 (the border of the partitioning powers, Prussian and Russian, ran on the territory of today&#x27;s town). In 1807, the Duchy of Warsaw was created, but the territory of Hajnówka (Białystok region) was handed over in full to Russia. After the fall of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1815, Hajnówka remained in the hands of tsarist Russia. The tsarist authorities abolished the forest protection, but the development of the area did not start. As most of the foresters, who worked in the forest, took part in the November Uprising of 1831 against Russia (500 out of 502 in total), their positions were abolished and the people were exiled to Siberia. The protection of the forest was affected. The village, as a matter of fact, ceased its existence. Protection was reintroduced in 1860 and the village was repopulated with Russian officials. In 1888 it became property of the tsarist family.

Between 1894 and 1906 the village was connected with the world by a railroad linking Bielsk Podlaski and Siedlce with Wołkowysk. Hajnówka became a minor transport junction and in 1900 a road was built between Białowieża and Bielsk Podlaski. During World War I, in 1915, the area was captured by the German Empire. Protection of the forest was ceased. The new authorities started large-scale industrial exploitation of the area&#x27;s nature resources. Because of its nodal position, Hajnówka became a seat of two lumber-mills, wood spirit distillery and a major train station for of narrow gauge railways were built across the forest.

===Interwar period and World War II===
In 1919, during the early stages of the Polish-Bolshevik War, the area was handed over to Poland by the local Ober-Ost commander. The predatory exploitation of the forest was put to an end and all German-built factories in the area became nationalised. After the war, some of them were rented by the Polish government under a contract to the British company The Century European Timber Corporation. However, in the late 1920s the contract was canceled and the wood processing plants came back under state control, while the Terbenthen factory was sold to a private owner. Since then, the economic growth started and the village started to grow too. Hard work, but also decent salaries in wood processing plants attracted many settlers from various parts of Poland. The initial conglomerate of wooden huts, barracks, tents and narrow, wood-paved streets turned into a town.
A Catholic church was built for the local population and soon the factories and the state financed three schools, a boarding school of timber industry, a post office, two cinemas and a bank appeared here. Jewish inhabitants built a synagogue and in 1925 the Orthodox Christians organised a chapel in a private flat. As of 1921, the population was 80.9% Polish and 13.8% Belarusian. Also, the soldiers of the Belarusian division of general Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz were interned there after the war and finally were allowed to settle in the area, which added Belarusians and Russians to the ethnic mixture.
By the end of the 1930s the four factories of Hajnówka had 1,947 workers altogether and were significantly expanded. The state financed construction of several hundred small houses for the workers and the town grew up rapidly. Also, the town attracted many notable Polish architects of the epoch to build new buildings in modernist style.
However, the progress was stopped by the German-Soviet invasion of Poland of 1939 and the outbreak of World War II. In the effect of the Nazi-Soviet Alliance, the town was annexed by the Soviet Union. The factories were dismantled and sent to Russia while a large part of the inhabitants were in 1940 arrested by the NKVD and imprisoned in the Soviet Gulag system. On 25 June 1941 the town got under German occupation, which ended on 18 July 1944. During the fights the town was severely bombed, which added to the destruction of the town. All in all, until July 18, 1944, more than 700 inhabitants of Hajnówka lost their lives, the factories were robbed and then demolished, while the train station and parts of the town centre were levelled by aerial bombardment.

===Recent period===
Despite harsh conditions and infrastructural losses, life returned to Hajnówka quite soon. This attracted new settlers as well as pre-war inhabitants of the area, so the town quickly recovered. Also, the narrow streets were mostly rebuilt. In 1951, the town (until then formally a village) was granted with city rights and between 1954 and 1975 it even served as a seat of a powiat. Hajnówka has 8 schools as well as 5 churches (Catholic and Eastern Orthodox), 2 hospitals, a sewer system, a swimming pool and a museum. Train and bus links were established. In 2005, the local timber factory expanded its production area to 17,500 sq.m, one of the largest in Europe. It is quite modern and used for manufacturing of furniture, mainly to be exported to Western Europe.
==Demographics==
===Jews===
Jews settled in Hajnówka at the end of the 19th century. It was one of the youngest Jewish communities in the Grodno Governorate. The influx of Jews was the result of the development of the timber industry and access to the railway line (from 1906). However, the Jewish community was not established until just before World War I. In 1921, there were 748 Jews in the city. In 1937, Hajnówka had about 12,000 inhabitants, including about 250 Jews. In the years 1939-1942, about 600 Jews lived in Hajnówka. The largest concentration of Jewish houses and squares was located near the main synagogue on Targowa Street (now Buczka), on Orzechowskich Square, in the so-called Zaułek Mlynarski and in the vicinity of the Jewish school on Polna Street (currently Grunwaldzka) in the Sokol house. Opposite the school there was a mikveh built shortly before the war and demolished in 1940. Hajnówka Jews also lived in the area of Batorego Street and Lipowa Streets. The local Jews were buried in the Jewish cemeteries in Narewka and Orla. The last rabbi was Jehuda Lejb. The main synagogue (there was still a small house of prayer) was built on a stone foundation around 1927/8 made of wooden logs. It was located on Targowa Street. The second entrance was from Północna Street for women. The synagogue was burned down by the Germans on June 25, 1941 by throwing hand grenades into the interior.

<text>Drohiczyn () (, ) is a town in Siemiatycze County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, Poland. The town has a population of 2,110 and is situated on the bank of the Bug River. Drohiczyn has a long and rich history, as in the past it was one of the most important cities of the region of Podlachia. Currently, it is the seat of Roman Catholic Diocese of Drohiczyn.

== History ==
A Neolithic settlement, La Tène culture crematoria, and ancient graves have been uncovered in what now is Drohiczyn. Drohiczyn, regarded as one of the oldest towns of the region of Podlasie, was in ancient times located among dense forests.

=== Middle Ages ===
In early Middle Ages, the town&#x27;s territory was inhabited by the warring tribe of Yotvingians. It is not known who founded the Drohiczyn gord: it was most likely a defensive settlement of the Yotvingians, mentioned in Rus&#x27; chronicles in 1061. In 1142, Grand Duke Vsevolod II of Kiev divided his realm between his family, granting Drohiczyn (as Dorohychin) and Brest to his younger brother Igor. Some time in late 12th century, Drohiczyn was under the Polish rule. On March 8, 1237, Duke Konrad I of Masovia handed Drohiczyn, together with the area between the Bug and the Narew, to the Order of Dobrzyń.

In 1241, taking advantage of the chaos which ensued after the Mongol Invasion of Poland, Lithuanian Grand Duke Mindaugas captured Podlasie together with Drohiczyn, Bielsk Podlaski, Mielnik, Brańsk and Suraż, annexing it into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Rus dukes did not want to give up this region, and regained Drohiczyn after a few years. In 1251, Rus forces, gathered at Drohiczyn, invaded the Yotvingians. After a victorious war, the position of Duke Daniel of Galicia grew so strong that he was crowned the King of Ruthenia. This happened in Drohiczyn in 1253.

In 1274, Drohiczyn was again captured by the Lithuanians, and the town with whole province remained in Lithuania until the Union of Lublin (1569), with the exception in the 1380s and 1430s, when Drohiczyn was ruled by the Duke of Masovia Janusz. The Lithuanian duke Jonas Vaidutis was born in the town in 1367 and titled himself the Duke of Drohiczyn.

Drohiczyn was one of major cities of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, together with Trakai, Vilnius and Navahrudak. In the 15th century, most of town’s population was of Ruthenian heritage, with Polish, Jewish and Lithuanian minorities. In 1498, its position was officially recognized, when it was granted Magdeburg rights.

=== Early modern era ===
During the reign of Sigismund I the Old, Drohiczyn was named capital and administrative seat of Podlasie Voivodeship, which was established in 1513. Local sejmiks took place here. At that time, the town experienced its golden age. In 1569 with the Union of Lublin, Drohiczyn was annexed to the Kingdom of Poland. The town continued to prosper, despite a plague outbreak in 1624, which decimated the population. Furthermore, in the 1630s there were two fires, in which several houses burned. Since mid-1630s, the population of Drohiczyn began to decline.

==== The Deluge ====
The Deluge (1655–1660) brought widespread destruction and misery, after which Drohiczyn never recovered to its former greatness. Swedish soldiers, led by Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie appeared in the town in August 1655. They immediately looted Drohiczyn, ordering its residents to pay an enormous contribution. In late 1655, a unit of Crimean Tatars, allied with Poland, appeared in the area of Drohiczyn and spent whole winter here, looting all farms and the town.

On May 3, 1657, a Transilvanian army of George II Rákóczi, which also consisted of Swedes, Cossacks and Wallachians, captured Drohiczyn. Most of residents were brutally murdered, and the town, together with the parish church and the castle, was completely destroyed. Survivors fled to nearby forests, and the town virtually ceased to exist.

==== Great Northern War ====
Drohiczyn slowly recovered from the destruction, but in 1699, it was burned again, this time by Saxon soldiers, who were on their way to Lithuania. The town suffered during the Great Northern War: hunger was widespread, and the marching armies of Sweden, Saxony, Russia, Poland and Lithuania looted Drohiczyn.

=== 19th century ===
Following the third partition of Poland, Drohiczyn was divided in 1795 between Habsburg Empire and the Kingdom of Prussia, as the new border went along the Bug river. On May 27, 1805, the town burned in a great fire, in which all archives, kept at the town hall, were lost forever. In 1807, the Duchy of Warsaw was created, and Drohiczyn was once again divided between the duchy and Russian Empire. In 1808, Russian authorities created Drohiczyn County, part of Grodno Governorate. In 1861, the population of both parts of Drohiczyn was 1700, with 1400 living in Polish district, and 300 inhabiting Ruthenian district. Residents of the town and its surroundings actively participated in the January Uprising.

=== Interbellum ===
According to the 1921 census, the village was inhabited by 1.972 people, among whom 950 were Roman Catholic, 207 Orthodox, 1 Evangelical and 814 Mosaic. At the same time, 1.165 inhabitants declared Polish nationality, 114 Belarusian, 687 Jewish and 6 another. There were 289 residential buildings in the village. In the Second Polish Republic, Drohiczyn belonged to Bialystok Voivodeship.

=== World War II ===
The town was briefly seized by the Wehrmacht during the Invasion of Poland, and on September 27, 1939, it was occupied by the Soviet Union. Until June 1941, Drohiczyn was a border town. The Soviet regime immediately began expelling the town&#x27;s residents to Siberia. Those selected by the NKVD were ordered to march with their bags to the rail station at Siemiatycze, located 20 kilometers away. There they were loaded into freight cars and taken to Siberia, where most perished.

In the spring of 1940, the Soviet commandant of the town ordered all houses located within 800 meters from the river to be moved to other locations, for security reasons, as the Bug marked the border between the Soviet Union and the Third Reich. This order meant that most of Drohiczyn would cease to exist, as most houses and other buildings were located by the river. As a result, several historical structures were destroyed at that time, including two churches and a 17th-century manor house. The Soviets spared only the houses which were necessary for the border patrol and families of officers. Furthermore, the Soviet occupants devastated the local church, which was turned into stables, and a Benedictine abbey, which served as a warehouse of building materials. In search of gold and jewelry, Soviet soldiers destroyed tombs at the cemetery. The Russian language and Communist ideology were taught at local schools; several teachers were fired and arrested.

In November 1939, after a rigged referendum, Drohiczyn was annexed into the Soviet Belarus, and USSR passports were handed to local residents. This resulted in mass draft of teenagers into the Red Army, also a large group of 14- and 15-year-olds was sent to the heavy industry plants at Omsk; most of them never returned home. Drohiczyn turned into a ghost town, with heavy Soviet patrols guarding the border. After a few months of Soviet rule, almost all foodstuffs were scarce, and local residents had to smuggle them from Germany, at risk of their own life.

The German attack on June 22, 1941 took the residents of the town by surprise. Soviet authorities were also surprised, but before retreating, they managed to murder several men kept in the cellar of the abbey. As a result of an artillery barrage, many buildings were destroyed, and the ancient Franciscan church was damaged. Drohiczyn was quickly captured, and during the German occupation, the town was an important center of the Home Army and other partisan organizations. Local Jews were in the autumn of 1942 transported to the rail station at Siemiatycze, and then to Treblinka extermination camp. Until 1944, Drohiczyn remained a border town. Together with the whole Bezirk Bialystok, Drohiczyn belonged to East Prussia, while the General Government was located on the other side of the Bug. German authorities permitted local Poles to settle in the border area, they also allowed the church to be reopened.

The Red Army entered Drohiczyn without resistance on August 1, 1944. The Soviet authorities were met with apprehension, as the locals remembered the terror of 1939–1941, and feared that Drohiczyn would be reattached to Soviet Belarus. Polish administration was created, together with school system. The NKVD arrested several soldiers of the Home Army, sending them to Siberia. In autumn of 1946, the local network of Freedom and Independence was destroyed, and its leaders were sentenced to death. Since Drohiczyn was regarded in the 1950s as the hotbed of pro-Catholic and anti-Communist reaction, the authorities neglected the town and its development.

=== Recent period ===
In 1991, the town was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Drohiczyn as part of the newly created Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Białystok.

== Churches ==
In 1392, Władysław II Jagiełło founded a wooden Roman Catholic church in Drohiczyn. The church was replaced with a brick one in 1555. Burned by the Swedes in 1657, it was rebuilt in 1709.

<text>Dąbrowa Białostocka is a town in Sokółka County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 5,305.

==History==
=== Jewish history ===
The Jewish community of Dąbrowa Białostocka, also known as Dąbrowa Grodzieńska, flourished between the 18th and early 20th centuries. By 1921, approximately over 1,200 Jews resided in the town, accounting for about 40% of its population. The community maintained religious, cultural, and educational institutions, including a *Tarbut* school and various Zionist political organizations. Jewish residents were integral to the town&#x27;s economic and social fabric, with many involved in trade and artisanal crafts.

==== The Holocaust ====
In September 1939, the German army occupied Dąbrowa Białostocka, but control soon passed to the Soviet Union under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. The situation drastically changed in June 1941, with the launch of Operation Barbarossa. The Germans re-occupied the town, burning many buildings, including homes and community infrastructure.

Most of the Jewish population attempted to escape to nearby towns such as Nowy Dwór and Suchowola, sharing the fate of those communities. Approximately 600 Jews who remained in Dąbrowa Białostocka were confined in a temporary ghetto housed in the town&#x27;s bathhouse and cinema. These individuals were subjected to forced labor, and a group of young men was murdered during this period.

In May 1942, older Jewish residents were deported to the ghetto in Suchowola. On November 2, 1942, the remaining Jews were sent to the Kiełbasin transit camp. From there, on December 14, 1942, they were transported to the Treblinka extermination camp, where they were murdered.

==== Post-Holocaust and commemoration ====
The Jewish community of Dąbrowa Białostocka was completely annihilated during the Holocaust. Post-war, no significant Jewish population returned to the town. However, the legacy of the Jewish community is honored through various commemorative projects. One notable initiative is *Kaddish for Dąbrowa Białostocka*, a series of artworks by Mark Podwal that memorializes the town&#x27;s Jewish history and pays tribute to its victims. Additionally, local efforts include memorial plaques and a mural project to preserve the memory of the once-thriving Jewish community.

== Demographics ==

According to the 1921 census, the population was 58.1% Polish, 40.0% Jewish, 1.1% Tatar, 0.7% Belarusian.

<text>Choroszcz () is a town in north-eastern Poland, located in Białystok County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, seat of Gmina Choroszcz.

The Baroque palace in Choroszcz was the summer residence of the noble Branicki family, and is now part of the Museum of Polish Interiors. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 5,960.

==History==

Choroszcz was granted town rights by King Sigismund I the Old in 1507. It was a private town, administratively located in the Podlaskie Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. Jan Klemens Branicki erected a Baroque palace, which served as the summer residence of the Branicki family. Following the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795, it was annexed by Prussia. In 1807, it passed to the Russian Partition of Poland. Choroszcz was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents during the January Uprising. The execution sites are now marked by memorials. Following World War I, Poland regained independence and control of the town.

In 1930, a psychiatric hospital was established in the town.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was first occupied by the Soviet Union until 1941, and then by Germany until 1944. In 1940, the Russians closed the psychiatric hospital and deported some patients to the Soviet Union, while others were relocated to the local rectory. In 1941, the Germans massacred several hundred remaining patients of the psychiatric hospital in today&#x27;s Nowosiółki district as part of &quot;Aktion T4&quot;.

After the war, it was administratively located in the &quot;large&quot; Białystok Voivodeship until 1975, and then the &quot;small&quot; Białystok Voivodeship until 1998.

== Demographics ==

Detailed data as of 31 December 2021:
In the 1921 census, 81.2% people declared Polish nationality, 16.2% declared Jewish nationality and 1.8% declared German nationality. Choroszcz had 827 Jewish residents in 1897, and 450 in 1921. Nearly all were murdered in the Holocaust by the Germans during the Second World War.

<text>Kleszczele (, ) is a town in Hajnówka County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, north-eastern Poland.

==History==

Kleszczele was granted town rights by King Sigismund I the Old in 1523. It was a royal town of Poland. Queen consort Bona Sforza founded a Catholic church in 1544. In 1578, King Stephen Bathory issued a privilege regarding salt trade. His wife, Queen consort Anna Jagiellon administered the town. The townspeople prospered off of growing and selling hops to Królewiec.

During World War I, the town was occupied by Germany. In the interwar period, it was administratively located in the Bielsk County in the Białystok Voivodeship of Poland.

Following the invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, it was first occupied by the Soviet Union until 1941, then by Nazi Germany until 1944. After the war, it was administratively located in the &quot;large&quot; and then &quot;small&quot; Białystok Voivodeship until 1998.

==Demography==
According to the 1921 census, Kleszczele was inhabited by:
===Jews===
Already in the 16th century, Izaac Brodawka from Brześć Litewski received a royal privilege to build a brewery in Kleszczele. Since then, there has been a small Jewish community here, but it did not form a formal Qahal. In 1674, 13 Jews paid the &quot;pogórki&quot; register here. In 1688, the townspeople of Kleszczele obtained a privilege prohibiting Jews from living in the city &quot;de non tolerandis judaeis&quot;. From that time until the partitions of Poland, there were no Jews in Kleszczele. The census of 1799 showed 58 Jews out of 1888 residents, and in 1807 there were 75. According to the census of 1847, there were only 6 Jews, but this may have been a mistake. In 1878, there were 435 Jews living here, and according to the 1897 census, there were 710. The Jewish district in Kleszczele was not educated due to the small percentage of Jews in the city. Jews lived mainly in the market square and along the streets directly bordering the market square. The main synagogue was located on the then Chodiewnicka (supposedly today&#x27;s Przechodnia) Street, and in the interwar period, Kościelna Street. Jews also lived on Ciasna, Kościuszki, Kopernika and Łaziebna Streets. In the vicinity of the synagogue, there was one located in one of the auxiliary buildings at the synagogue.

In the Interwar period, Kleszczele did not have a rabbi. A rabbi from Orla came to the ceremonies. The Jewish cemetery was located about 1500 meters from the city on the road to Czeremcha. The first wooden synagogue existed at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1881, this building burned down along with part of the city. In this place, on September 30, 1881, on the initiative and largely with his own financial support, Mosze Gwin began building a new wooden synagogue. The building was located right next to the market square. During the German occupation, this synagogue was dismantled and a residential building was built from its materials on Boćkowska Street.

<text>Knyszyn (, ) is a town in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland, northwest of Białystok. It is situated on the Jaskranka River, within the historic region of Podlachia.

==History==
In 1358 the territory became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, soon afterwards in personal union with Poland. It was the property of Court Marshal of Lithuania Michael Glinski until confiscated and passed to the Grand Chancellor of Lithuania Mikołaj Radziwiłł in 1507. In 1569 it was re-incorporated into the Kingdom of Poland.

===Royal residence of King Sigismund II Augustus===

In 1568 Polish King Sigismund II Augustus granted Knyszyn town rights, and subsequently a town hall, public baths and a weigh house were built. Knyszyn was the favorite residence of the King, and was the Polish court&#x27;s main base for hunting expeditions into the nearby virgin forests. In the 1560s the king maintained a royal stud of over 3000 horses in Knyszyn, including large numbers of Arabian horses, among the first to be bred in northern Europe. Sigismund II died in the town in 1572, after which the royal property rapidly fell into neglect. Few signs of the former royal residence and extensive studs remain aside from foundations, which are poorly marked.

According to a legend, the heart of King Sigismund II is buried in the underground crypts of the church of St. John, which was built in the years 1579-1601 by the Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski, who became starost of Knyszyn in 1574. A monument of the king is located at the Market Square and the town&#x27;s coat of arms contains the king&#x27;s royal monogram.

===History since the 17th century===

Knyszyn was a royal town of Poland, administratively located in the Podlaskie Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. In 1630, Polish prince and soon-to-be King Władysław IV Vasa stayed in Knyszyn. The town was devastated during the Polish–Swedish wars. As a result of the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 it was annexed by Prussia; in 1807 it was annexed by Russia. At that time, many Jews settled in Knyszyn, as a result of the discriminatory Russian regulations (Pale of Settlement), while the Polish population was subject to repressions and Russification policies. Local Poles took part in various Polish uprisings during the partition period. Knyszyn became part of Poland again after the country has regained independence in 1918.
During World War II it was occupied by the Soviet Union (1939–1941) and Nazi Germany (1941–1944). The population was subjected to various repressions and crimes. The Soviets devastated farm buildings and the royal garden,
 and closed down both Polish and Jewish schools, and opened a Russian school instead. The Germans established and operated a forced labour camp in the town. Its prisoners were initially Soviet prisoners of war, and afterwards Poles from the town and region, often captured in roundups, some of whom were soon deported to forced labour to Germany. Knyszyn had a Jewish population of nearly 2,000 until Nazi Germany invaded the area, after which most of Knyszyn&#x27;s Jews were killed.

Until 1998, it was administratively located in the Białystok Voivodeship (1975-1998).

===Jewish history===
The history of Jews in the town may date back as far as October 1605 when a Jew from Moscow sued the town over a beating he had endured. However, during the mid 1600s the town passed a law forbidding Jews to live in the town. Despite this decree a small Jewish community had settled in Knyszyn by 1679 and in 1705 a synagogue was built. In 1719 an agreement was reached between the Jewish community and the Church, requiring the former to pay a tax annually, with additional levees on several holidays. In exchange for this the exclusionary law was formally repealed.

By the early 1800s (1807) the Jewish population had reached 308. In 1810 an attempt was made to expel them but was quickly cancelled when the town economy collapsed. The Jews continued to benefit the Knyszyn economy by developing a textile industry during the 1830s. This helped support the burgeoning Jewish population which consisted of 1878 (out of a total town population of 3864) in the 1879 census.

Immigration lowered the population so that in the 1921 Polish census it was recorded as 1235. During the 1920s and 30s the community supported four restaurants, two groceries, and seven bakeries. They owned three mills, a leather factory, and a service station. There were also branches of the Betar organization and the Hadema sports club, and many charities. The 1939 population of 1450 had increased to 2000 by 1941. Most of this growth came from refugees who reached Knyszyn- then under Soviet occupation- from German-occupied regions.

The town was first occupied by the Germans for several weeks of September 1939 and then by the Russians until June 1941. Shortly after the Nazi occupation a pogrom occurred as well as the burning alive of 200 Jews in a synagogue. In November 1942 a massacre of the remaining Jewish population was carried out by the Gestapo. Fifty Jews survived by hiding in the nearby woods. Most immigrated to Israel after the war.

<text>Łapy is a town in north-eastern Poland, in Białystok County, Podlaskie Voivodeship; the administrative centre of the urban-rural gmina Łapy. It is situated in the North Podlasie Lowland, on the river Narew.

According to data from 31 December 2010, the town had 16,049 inhabitants.

Situated here are the bankrupt Railway Fleet Repair Works, a dairy, and the sugar refinery closed in February 2008. Now, Łapy is a medical and educational centre for the region of the former Łapy county.

== Location ==
The town of Łapy is located in north-eastern Poland. According to Kondracki&#x27;s division of Poland into physico-geographical regions, the town of Łapy sits on North-Podlasie Plain, over the Upper Valley of Narew. The town of Łapy lies by the Narew river. The terrain is elevated here from 120 to 130 metres. 

Included in Białystok agglomeration, the town is situated in the buffer zone of Narew National Park.

According to data from 1 January 2010, the town area then was 12.14 km2.

Between 1954 and 1975 Łapy was the administrative centre of Łapy County of Białystok Voivodeship. Between 1975 and 1998 the voivodeship was smaller.

=== Residential areas ===
Presently Łapy comprises the following parts:
* Barwiki
* Bociany
* Goździki
* Leśniki
* Osse
* Wity
* Wygwizdowo
* Zięciuki

== History ==

=== Foundation ===

The name &#x27;Łapy&#x27; is of Masovian origin, and it initially represented a soubriquet of the kin, who founded the settlement on Narew. A legend links the foundation of the town with the nobleman Łappa of the Lubicz coat of arms, who settled down here during the 15th-century Masovian colonisation.

The first historical records of these lands come from the early 13th century. It is known that in 1375 Płonka Kościelna was an independent parish. Firstly Łapy was a backwater where the gentry cultivated patriotic traditions. Soon as a result of the village&#x27;s development, new settlements emerged on the eastern and the western banks of the river Narew, which was a water trade route from Suraż to Gdańsk in 16th and 17th centuries, and after World War II from Puszcza Białowieska to Tykocin; and at the east side of the high road from Suraż to Płonka.

=== Expansion ===

Following the expansion of the family, a series of backwaters were founded, including Rechy, Brusięta, Barwiki, Korczaki, Pluśniaki, Wągle, Wity, Zięciuki, Kosmyki, Łazie, Stryjce, Wojtysze. Some of those names disappeared replaced by others, such as: Goździki, Dębowizna, Bociany, Leśniki. After the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795, Łapy fell to the Prussian Partition. In 1807, after the Tilsit Peace Treaty, it became a part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution, in 1815, it passed to so-called Congress Poland in the Russian Partition of Poland. An important event for the future history of Łapy was Napoleonic army&#x27;s marching through twice in 1812. In the 1820s the backwaters had 1000 inhabitants and 180 houses. In 1825, a fusion of six backwaters (Łapy-Barwiki, Łapy-Leśniki, Łapy-Zięciuki, Łapy-Wity, Łapy-Goździki, Łapy-Bociany) produced the farm settlement of Łapy.

=== Industrialisation ===

Łapy owes its development to the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway with a station here, opened on 15 December 1862, and to the French having built here the works for repairing steam locomotives and carriages the same year.
That caused an influx of tradesmen and labourers not only from the nearby villages, but also from distant Polish locations and from the Russian Empire.
In the beginning of the January Uprising, the railway station was captured by a Polish insurgent detachment of Władysław Cichorski &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Zameczek&quot; on the night of 22–23 January 1863, and then recaptured by the Russians on 27 January 1863. Further clashes between Polish insurgents and Russian troops were fought in Łapy on 11 and 18 July 1863. Following World War I, Poland regained independence and control of Łapy.

The repair works exist today as &#x27;ZNTK Łapy S.A.&#x27; They played a decisive role in Łapy&#x27;s urbanization, the town charter granted on 1 January 1925.

At the eve of the German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in 1939, the town population reached 8,000 citizens. Following the invasion, Łapy was first occupied by the Soviet Union until 1941, and then by Germany until 1944, when it was finally restored to Poland. During the war, the town was 80% destroyed, and the entire local Jewish population was murdered by the German occupiers in the Holocaust.
== Transport ==

=== Roads ===

There are two voivodeship roads crossing the town:
* Roszki-Wodźki – Łapy – Brańsk – Ciechanowiec
* Łapy – Markowszczyzna

Furthermore, the national road runs to the north, being upgraded to express-way.

=== Railway ===

There are two railway routes going through the town:
* Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway (Białystok – Warsaw)
* Łapy – Ostrołęka (partly out of order)

Łapy hosts a railway station for all kinds of trains, which is situated in the town centre; and a railway stop Łapy Osse for slow trains only, in the Osse quarter, from the centre.

Łapy&#x27;s railway destinations are numerous: Bielsko-Biała, Warsaw, Suwałki, Białystok, Wrocław, Opole, Częstochowa, Kraków, Szczecin, Poznań.

=== Bus services ===

There are many small PKS bus stops and the main one – Łapy, next to the railway station building in the centre, from which local lines operate in the directions of Białystok, Zambrów, Siemiatycze, Bielsk Podlaski, etc.

=== Bike and foot trails ===

== Economy ==
Until 2009, Łapy&#x27;s economy was mainly based on the then functioning:
* sugar refinery, being one of the best in Poland and selling its sugar to &quot;inter alia&quot; Islamic countries and to the Middle East;
* and Railway Fleet Repair Works.
Unfortunately for the town, both of the works have been closed.

There are plans to create a subzone of Tarnobrzeg Special Economic Zone. A corresponding bill has been submitted at The Cabinet.

The development of industrial economy in Łapy and its neighbourhood is hindered first of all by the close proximity of Narew National Park. On the other hand, the town has a potential for the tourism industry.

<text>Mońki is a town in northeastern Poland and, as of 1999, is situated in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. From 1975 to 1998 it was part of the Białystok Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Mońki County.

== History ==
In the 16th century, Mońki was a village owned by the Mońko family. In the 19th century, when building railroad from Grodno was in progress, in the neighborhood of Mońki a train station was built. After the First World War a Catholic church was built. In the late World War II Germans destroyed the church. After the war, in 1954, the village was adopted as capital of the Mońki county. That increased development of the village and in 1965 Mońki became a city. In 1975 the county was deleted, but it returned in 1999 (1998).

== Symbols ==
Mońki&#x27;s coat of arms presents a lady with potatoes. It is connected with an old type of farming in Mońki village and it neighbourhood. In city (also in 2012) was organised a day of potato.

Many of Mońki&#x27;s inhabitants have moved abroad, particularly to the US, so they can send remittances to their families.

== Economy ==
In Mońki existed especially food enterprises. The largest is Moniecka Spółdzielnia Mleczarska (dairy).

== Education ==
In Mońki existed two primary school (one connected with first grade music school), gymnasium. general liceum, technikum and szkoła zawodowa.

== Transport ==
Through Mońki goes droga krajowa 65 (road), connecting city with Białystok and Grajewo.

== Export ==

Several tech companies have risen during the last 10 years.

== Tourism ==
Near Mońki there are some of the greatest swamps in Europe, the Biebrza River Swamps, and in 1993 the government created the Biebrza National Park (BNP) to recognise and protect their unique nature. The Biebrza River Swamps are an important habitat for rare birds such as the ruff &quot;(pol. batalion)&quot;, which is a symbol of the BNP.

==Notable people==
*Maria Janion (1926-2020), literary critic and feminist

<text>Siemiatycze ( &quot;Siamiatyčy&quot;) is a town in eastern Poland, with 14,391 inhabitants (2019). It is the capital of Siemiatycze County in the Podlaskie Voivodeship.

==History==

The history of Siemiatycze dates back to the mid-16th century, when the village was part of the Podlasie Voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1542, King Sigismund II Augustus granted town charter to Siemiatycze, and with the 1569 Union of Lublin, it passed to the Kingdom of Poland within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

For centuries Siemiatycze remained property of several Polish-Lithuanian magnate families. The town, conveniently located along the Bug River, and near local administrative centers at Drohiczyn and Mielnik, became a popular market place, where farmers sold their produce. The disastrous Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–60) did not bring widespread destruction to Siemiatycze. The town continued to prosper, at the expense of other municipalities of the region of Podlachia, some of which were burned to the ground by the Swedish, Transilvanian and Russian invaders.

In the 18th century, Siemiatycze was among the most developed towns of the region. At that time it belonged to the Sapieha family, which founded the town hall, synagogue and other buildings. Noblewoman Anna Jabłonowska founded a midwifery institute, hospital, monastery, palace with a museum and a new printing house. She also obtained a permission from the kings of Poland for the town to hold two annual fairs. In 1807 Siemiatycze was annexed by the Russian Empire, and during the January Uprising, the Battle of Siemiatycze took place here, after which most of the town was destroyed, together with the Jabłonowski Palace, which has never been rebuilt. Following World War I, Poland regained independence and control of the town.

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Siemiatycze was invaded by Germany, which then handed it over to the Soviets in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The Soviets carried out arrests of prominent local Poles, including the town&#x27;s mayor. The Soviet Union occupied the town until 1941, and afterwards it was occupied by Germany until 1944. Siemiatycze was to a large extent destroyed during the war, and its significant Jewish community was almost completely exterminated by the Nazis (with the help of the local Poles) in the Holocaust, although a few Jews survived by paying their neighbors to hide them. After the war, the population of the town shrank to 4,000.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Białystok Voivodeship.

<text>Sokółka (; , ) is a town in northeastern Poland, seat of the Sokółka County in Podlaskie Voivodeship. It is a busy rail junction located on the international Warsaw–Białystok–Grodno line, with additional connections which go to Suwałki and the Lithuanian border.

== History ==

The settlement was founded as a royal village located on the route connecting Knyszyn and Grodno. Sokółka was granted town rights by King Sigismund III Vasa in 1609. The town&#x27;s layout with its central square is attributed to starost Antoni Tyzenhauz.

In the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795, the town was annexed by Prussia, and in 1807 it passed to the Russian Partition of Poland. In 1861, Walery Wróblewski came to Sokółka and founded a secret organization in preparation for a Polish uprising, which broke out in 1863. He was one of the main organizers of the January Uprising in the territory between Białystok and Grodno. He organized an insurgent unit and commanded in many battles in the region, and eventually became one of the leaders of the uprising for the entire Białystok and Grodno regions. Sokółka was one of the sites of Russian executions of Polish insurgents during the January Uprising.

In 1873 Sokolka was the birthplace of Alexander Bogdanov, polymath and revolutionary, who was a serious rival to Lenin for leadership of the Bolshevik Party in its early years.

Following World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the town.

In the course of the Soviet invasion of Poland at the start of World War II, Sokółka was captured by the Red Army on 21 September 1939, and then occupied by the Soviet Union under which it was annexed into the Byelorussian SSR on 14 November 1939. It was administered as a part of the Belastok Region of the Byelorussian SSR. Several Poles from Sokółka, including the town&#x27;s mayor, were murdered by the NKVD in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. Sokółka was under German occupation from June 1941 until 24 July 1944. It was administered as a part of the Bialystok District of Nazi Germany. The Germans established the Sokółka Ghetto for the imprisonment of Polish Jews. The ghetto served as staging point for deportations to death camps during the Holocaust similar to most Jewish ghettos across the occupied country. The Jews of all surrounding villages and towns including Krynki, Janów, Czyżew, and Zaręby Kościelne were kept there. In total, 8,000–9,000 people were murdered. The main synagogue was destroyed. The Jewish community was not restored.

On 24 July 1944, troops of the 2nd Belorussian Front of the Red Army dislodged the German occupying forces from the town. Its administration reverted initially to the Byelorussian SSR, but on 16 August 1945, it was restored to Poland. Administratively it was located in the &quot;large&quot; Białystok Voivodeship until 1975, then the &quot;small&quot; Białystok Voivodeship until 1998.

==Sights==
The sights of Sokółka include the Museum of Sokółka Land (&quot;Muzeum Ziemi Sokólskiej&quot;), historic townhouses and the historic churches: the Catholic church of St. Anthony built in a neoclassical style in 1848, and the St. Alexander Newski&#x27;s Orthodox Church from 1830.

==Transport==
Sokółka is located on the S19 highway, parts of which (including the local part) are still under construction (as of 2021). There is also a train station in the town.
==Sports==
The local football club is Sokół Sokółka. It competes in the lower leagues.

<text>Suchowola (; , &quot;Suchavolja&quot;) is a town in north-eastern Poland in Sokółka County in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, located on both banks of the Olszanka River. Its population is 2,196 (2017).

==History==
Suchowola was founded in the 16th century and in 1777 it was granted town rights. It is a former Polish royal town. In 1775, royal astronomer Szymon Antoni Sobiekrajski published a report in which he stated that Suchowola is the exact geographic centre of Europe.
During the Polish–Soviet War, the invading Soviets murdered five Poles in Suchowola on August 9, 1920.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was initially occupied by the Soviet Union. At the beginning of the war, the town&#x27;s population was about 3,000, about 1,500 of whom were Jewish. Several Poles who worked or lived in pre-war Suchowola were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in 1940. In June 1941, the town passed under German occupation, and an auxiliary Polish police force recruited. The SS in conjunction with the Polish police and some local Poles, brutalized, raped, robbed, and murdered Jews with impunity throughout July. On one occasion, Jews were driven into a pond and beaten until several drowned. Dozens of Jews were burned alive after the Polish police and SS drove them into a house and setting it on fire. Visiting German dignitaries watched and took photographs of the violence. Later in July, the Germans established a ghetto, which was seriously overcrowded and without adequate water. Jews from neighboring villages were brought to the ghetto over the next few months. The Poles and Jews robbed and beat the Jews as they entered the ghetto. To try to make the ghetto livable, and to combat starvation and disease, the Jewish population established a bakery, planted vegetable gardens, opened a medical clinic and pharmacy, and mandated periodic baths in a public bathhouse.

In November 1942, the Polish and German police rounded up the Jews in the ghetto. The sick and elderly were shot there. Others were loaded onto horse drawn carts or made to walk 34 miles to a transit camp in Kiełbasin, south of Grodno. Though most Jews in the transit camp were sent to Treblinka or Auschwitz, Suchowola&#x27;s Jews were sent to the Grodno ghetto in December. Many Jews died there after contracting diseases in the transit camp. A few Suchowola Jews were able to escape and were sheltered by local Poles. There are thought to have been 23 Jewish survivors from Suchowola. Though several Polish auxiliary policemen were charged and tried for war crimes, after initial convictions, they were let off in the Polish postwar trials. A summary of Suchowola&#x27;s wartime experiences can be found in the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos.

Due to serious losses in population during World War II, namely the entire Jewish population and some Poles who also lost their lives, the rights of a town were halted in 1950. On January 1, 1997, Suchowola became a town again. Polish priest Jerzy Popiełuszko, who was born in the nearby village of Okopy, was baptized in the local Church of Saints Peter and Paul. He also attended school in Suchowola. Currently, the municipal park by the church bears his name. His monument is located in the park, and in the town there is also a small museum dedicated to him.

Other sights include the historic Church of Saints Peter and Paul, and a boulder symbolizing the geographic centre of Europe, located in the municipal park. Many people still visit Suchowola today.

==Demographics==

==Cuisine==
The officially protected traditional food from Suchowola is &quot;sękacz z Suchowoli&quot;, a local type of sękacz, a traditional cake of north-eastern Poland (as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland).

<text>Supraśl (; ; ) is a town and former episcopal see in Białystok County, in Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland. It is the seat of the Gmina Supraśl.

It is situated on the Supraśl River, about northeast of Białystok. Its population is 4,526 (2004).

== History ==

The settlement was founded in the 16th century. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, it was annexed by Prussia. In 1807 it passed to the Russian Partition of Poland. In 1823, a 10th-century manuscript, the oldest Slavic literary work in Poland, named the &quot;Codex Suprasliensis&quot;, was discovered in the Supraśl Monastery by Michał Bobrowski.

After 1831, the textile industry developed. In 1834 manufacturer Wilhelm Fryderyk Zachert came from Zgierz to Supraśl and significantly contributed to the development of the village into a town. Until the mid-19th century, it was the largest center of the textile industry in the region, before it was surpassed by nearby Białystok. In the 19th century, mostly Catholics lived there, but also Protestants, Orthodox and Jews. During World War I from 1915 to 1919 it was occupied by the Germans. After 1919, in independent Poland. During World War II it was occupied by the Soviets from 1939 to 1941 and by the Germans from 1941 to 1944. The Soviets destroyed part of the monastery&#x27;s interior, and the Germans destroyed most of the industrial plants.

From 1944 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Białystok Voivodeship.

In 2001 Supraśl was recognized as a spa town.

=== Ecclesiastical History ===
* On 6 March 1798 was established the Ruthenian Catholic Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Supraśl / Supraslien(sis) Ruthenorum (Latin adjective), on presently Polish territory not previously served by that particular church &quot;sui iuris&quot; (Byzantine Rite in Ruthenian language). Pope Pius VI&#x27;s papal bulla &quot;Susceptam a Nobis di papa&quot;, thus canonically executed its erection, which was devised by the Prussian kingdom (Fredrick William II) in January 1797 for the parts of the Eparchy of Brėst and Archeparchy of Kiev that became Prussian in the Third partition of Poland. The Pope made it exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province, and installed a cathedral chapter comprising a provost and four canons.
* It was suppressed on 1809.02.14, without Catholic successor, by imperial edict of the Czar Alexander I of Russia, annexing it to the Eparchy of Brest, after the Convention of Bartenstein (April 1807) and Peace of Tilsit (July 1807) transferred its territory from Prussia to the Russian empire.

It has had only three incumbents :
;&quot;Exempt Eparch (Bishops) of Supraśl of the Ruthenians&quot;
* Theodosius Wislocki, Basilian Order of Saint Josaphat (O.S.B.M.) (1797 – death 1801.05.18)
* Nicholas Duchnowski (1803.05.16 – death 1805.06.25)
*&quot; Bishop-elect Father Leo Jaworowski (1807 – 1809 not possessed lacking confirmation by Rome), next Auxiliary bishop of Eparch Jozafat Bułhak in Brest and titular bishop of Volodymyr.&quot;

Supraśl is also a titular bishopric of the Polish Orthodox Church.

==Demographics==

== Culture and heritage ==
It is the home of the Supraśl Lavra, founded by Aleksander Chodkiewicz, one of six Eastern Orthodox monasteries for men in Poland. The Codex of Supraśl, the oldest Slavic literary work in Poland and one of the oldest of its kind in the world, is named after the Supraśl Lavra. Since September 2007 it has been on UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World list. The Museum of Icons is located in the Chodkiewicz Palace within the monastery complex.

Other historic landmarks include the Buchholtz Palace, which now houses the Art High School, the Catholic churches of Our Lady Queen of Poland and of the Holy Trinity, the town hall, cinema, a 19th-century park and historic wooden architecture.

<text>Suraż is a town in north-eastern Poland situated in the Podlaskie Voivodeship, seat of Gmina Suraż in the Białystok County.

Suraż, which has a long and rich history, and was a royal town in the Kingdom of Poland, currently is one of the smallest municipalities of the country, with a population of only 1,012 (as of June 30, 2012).

==History==

The history of Suraż dates back to the 11th century, when a defensive gord was established on the right bank of the Narew river. In 1390, King Władysław II Jagiełło handed Suraż, together with other towns in the area, to Mazovian Duke Janusz I of Warsaw. The Suraź Castle is mentioned in a 1392 Teutonic Knights chronicle, when it was destroyed by forces of Grand Master Engelhard Rabe. Some time in the late 15th century, a new castle was built, with a brick tower, and a prison. The castle was destroyed during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655-1660).

Suraż received Magdeburg rights on September 16, 1445, from King Casimir IV Jagiellon. In 1520, it became seat of a powiat in the Land of Bielsk Podlaski, and in 1569, following the Union of Lublin, Suraż was transferred back to the Kingdom of Poland. Until the Partitions of Poland, it was administratively located in the Podlaskie Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. The town was inhabited by three communities - Polish, Jewish and Ruthenian.

Following the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795, the town was annexed by Prussia, and made part of the newly formed province of New East Prussia. On defeat of Prussia by Napoleon in 1807 at the following Treaty of Tilsit the area was part of the territory ceded to the Russian Empire. Its area was one of the centers of the Polish January Uprising of 1863–1864. A Polish insurgent unit entered the town and fought a victorious battle against the Russians already on the night of January 22–23, 1863, shortly after the uprising broke out. Further clashes took place on February 8, 1863 and May 13–14, 1863. After the rebellion, the Russians imposed heavy taxes on its residents, and the population of the town rapidly declined. Furthermore, construction of the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway (1862) bypassed Suraż, which deepened its decline. During World War I, the town was occupied by Germany. After the war, Poland regained independence and control of the town. According to the 1921 Polish census, the population was 94.2% Polish and 5.6% Jewish.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by the Soviet Union until 1941, and then by Germany until 1944. Afterwards it was restored to Poland.

From 1944 to 1975, it was administratively part of the &quot;large&quot; Białystok Voivodeship, and then from 1975 to 1998, it was part of the &quot;small&quot; Białystok Voivodeship.

<doc id="390459" wikidata="Q941451" url="?curid=390459" title="Tykocin">
<text>Tykocin (; ) is a small town in north-eastern Poland, with 2,010 inhabitants (2012), located on the Narew river, in Białystok County in the Podlaskie Voivodeship. It is one of the oldest towns in the region, with its historic center designated a Historic Monument of Poland.

== History ==
===Middle Ages===
The name of Tykocin was first mentioned in the 11th century. Through the 14th century, it was a castellany in the Duchy of Masovia on the border with pagan Lithuania. Tykocin received its city rights from prince Janusz I of Warsaw in 1425, but several months later, the settlement was transferred to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (within the Polish-Lithuanian Union) by the Polish king Władysław II Jagiełło. Shortly later, in around 1433, Duke Sigismund Kęstutaitis gave the town along with other surrounding villages to Jonas Gostautas, and it became the most important seat of the Lithuanian Gostautai noble family.

===Early modern era===

In the 1542, upon the death of Gostautai family&#x27;s last member, the town was acquired by Polish king and Lithuanian Grand Prince Sigismund II Augustus who had the medieval stronghold remodelled into a Renaissance castle. One of the largest arsenals of Poland was located in Tykocin. It subsequently became a royal town of the Polish Crown, located within the Podlaskie Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. In 1572, Polish Renaissance writer Łukasz Górnicki was appointed starost of Tykocin by Sigismund II Augustus. In the 16th and 17th centuries, Tykocin was granted new privileges by kings Stephen Báthory and Władysław IV Vasa. Krzysztof Wiesiołowski, starost of Tykocin, founded a hospital and shelter for injured and disabled knights, one of the oldest of its kind in Europe. Later on, the town was awarded to Hetman Stefan Czarniecki for his military service during the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1661. Afterwards, through the marriage of Czarniecki&#x27;s daughters, it passed to the Branicki (Gryf coat-of-arms) family. From 1513 until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Tykocin was a county (powiat) seat.

It was Tykocin, where in 1705, King Augustus II the Strong established the Order of the White Eagle, the highest and oldest Polish order.

Most of Tykocin&#x27;s landmarks was built in this era, including the Holy Trinity Church, monasteries of the Congregation of the Mission and the Bernardines, the former 17th-century military hospital, the synagogue and the statue of hetman Stefan Czarniecki.

===Late modern era and recent times===
Following the Partitions of Poland Tykocin was annexed by Prussia and Izabella Poniatowska-Branicka sold the town to the Prussian government in 1795. In 1807, it was briefly regained by Poles as part of the Duchy of Warsaw in accordance to the Treaty of Tilsit. In 1815, it became part of the Congress Kingdom of Poland, later on forcibly annexed by Imperial Russia.

During the November Uprising, on 21 May 1831, Polish insurgents won a battle against the Russians at Tykocin. After the massacres of Polish protesters committed by the Russians in Warsaw in 1861, Polish demonstrations and clashes with Russian soldiers took place in Tykocin. Shortly after the outbreak of the January Uprising, Tykocin was the site of a battle between Polish insurgents and Russian troops on 24–25 January 1863. During the uprising, Tykocin was attacked by a Cossack unit led by Captain Dmitriyev, who forced the populace to sign a request to the tsarist administration to make him the town&#x27;s military superior. In this way, he obtained office, and then committed macabre murders of the inhabitants. Dmitryev&#x27;s cruelty even caused the Russians themselves to report him to the tsarist authorities, but he was only fined.
Tykocin was reintegrated with Poland after the country regained independence after World War I in 1918. During the interwar period, the population of Tykocin had reached an estimated 4,000 inhabitants.

During World War II, it was occupied by the Soviets from 1939 to 1941 and the Germans from 1941 to 1944. The Jewish population of Tykocin, estimated at 2,000 people, eradicated by Nazi Germans during the Holocaust. On 25–26 August 1941, the Jewish residents of Tykocin were assembled at the market square for &quot;relocation&quot;, and then marched and trucked by the Nazis into the nearby Łopuchowo forest, where they were executed in waves into pits by SS Einsatzkommando Zichenau-Schroettersburg under SS-Obersturmführer Hermann Schaper. A memorial now exists outside the town for the Tykocin pogrom.

In 1950, Tykocin lost its town rights due to population loss in World War II, only to regain it in 1993. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the former Białystok Voivodeship.

<text>Wasilków is a town in north-eastern Poland, in Białystok County, in Podlaskie Voivodeship, about 3 km north of Białystok, with 12 559 inhabitants (2022). It is a northern suburb of Białystok, situated on the Supraśl River.

== History ==

The first traces of settlement in the Wasilków commune date back to the Middle Stone Age. Excavations conducted near the town of Nowodworce provided evidence of the settlement of these areas in the Bronze Age, which lasted in Poland until around 1800 BCE. One of the most interesting was the discovery of a flint mine in the Knyszyn Forest near Rybniki. As a result of the research, about fifty archaeological sites have been discovered in the commune. Traces of prehistoric and early-historic settlements have been found in the vicinity of almost every modern village in the Wasilków commune. However, nothing is known about the beginnings of Slavic settlement in Wasilków.

===Early history===
In the 11th century the territory of Wasilków belonged to Kievan Rus. In 1340, the area of Wasilkow was incorporated into Lithuania by Duke Gediminas. However, earlier this area belonged to Mazovia within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. The first mention in written sources about the area where the town and the Wasilków starosty was later established in 1358.

A breakthrough date in the history of Wasilków is December 8, 1566, when King Sigismund II Augustus granted town rights and a coat of arms. The town was inhabited by people from the vicinity of Goniądz, Tykocin and Białystok. Two days after granting town rights - on December 10, 1566, King Sigismund II Augustus issued a privilege allowing the creation of a Catholic parish.

In the middle of the 17th century Wasilków was inhabited by about 500 people, and the entire starosty additionally 400 people. The first records from this period appear about Jews who came from Choroszcz and settled in Wasilków. Before the first partition of Poland, Wasilków had about 1,500 inhabitants. After the Third Partition of Poland, Wasilków was incorporated into the Białystok Department of New East Prussia, and from 1807, under the Treaty of Tylża, into the Russian Partition of Poland.

===Late modern period===
Around 1880, Wasilków had 3,880 inhabitants. There were 12 textile factories in the town, ten of which were owned by Jews. All plants employed a total of about 300 people.

The tragic date in the history of the town is May 5, 1895, when a great fire destroyed almost half of Wasilków, and 10 people died in the fire. At the end of the 19th century, Wasilków had approx. 4,000 inhabitants. residents.

In November 1918, there were only two textile factories operating in the town, employing nearly 70 workers. In the 1921 census, 85.8% people declared Polish nationality, and 13.2% declared Jewish nationality.

World War II began in these lands on September 16, 1939, with the entry of the German army. Less than a week later, a cavalry detachment of the Soviet Red Army entered the Tui. This is how the Soviet occupation began, during which several dozen of Wasilkow families were deported to Kazakhstan. In August 1941, the Germans established a ghetto in Wasilków, in which about 1,250 Jews were held. The following year, they were taken to Treblinka, where they were murdered.

As a result of the war, the industry in Wasilków ceased to exist. The town was destroyed in 20%. In the post-war period, a significant date is July 1, 1947, when Father Wacław Rabczyński was appointed vicar and administrator of the parish under the invocation of Transfiguration of the Lord in Wasilków. The summary of the activities of Fr. Rabczyński began in 1958 and completed in 1966 the construction of the church of Of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Mercy at Kościuszko Street. Father Wacław Rabczyński was undoubtedly one of the most outstanding figures in the post-war history of the Wasilkow region.

In 1946 Wasilków had 3,948 inhabitants. The determinant of the changes taking place in the post-war years was the development of Emilia Plater Wool Industry Plant, which in its heyday employed about 2,500 employees. In 1959, the construction of an elementary school on Mickiewicza Street began, and in 1982 a primary school on Polna Street, which was officially opened on May 22, 1985.

After World War II, Wasilków became a satellite town of Białystok. On May 27, 1990, the first half-century free and democratic elections to local self-government took place.

In 2022, the number of inhabitants of the town and commune of Wasilków reaches nearly 19 thousand. and is constantly growing. Wasilków has become one of the most dynamically developing local government units in Podlaskie.

== Monuments ==

=== Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Mercy ===

The construction of the church was completed in 1966 thanks to the efforts of Fr. Wacław Rabczyński. The previous church, which was demolished in 1867 by the tsarist authorities, was situated in the same place. The building combines the styles of old Christian and modernist architecture. In the middle of the church there is an altar, in line with the changes introduced to the liturgy by the Second Vatican Council. Since 2015, the International Festival of Organ and Chamber Music has been held here every year.

=== Orthodox church of Saints Peter and Paul ===
The five-dome, brick church was built in the mid-nineteenth century and consecrated in 1853 by the Bishop of Brzeg, Ignacy. In 1857, a free-standing, brick belfry was built in the style of the church, which also serves as a gate. In 1867, the church was partially burnt. The following year, after being struck by lightning, it burned down completely. Reconstruction ended in 1875.

=== Church of Transfiguration of the Lord ===

The beginnings of the parish are closely related to the granting of town rights to the settlement of Wasilków by king Zygmunt August on December 8, 1556. Two days after this event, the king issued a foundation document under which a wooden temple in Wasilków was erected. The first temple was built on the so-called &quot;Kościelisko&quot; - on the hill behind the present church. The modern brick neo-baroque church was built in 1883.

=== Roman Catholic cemetery ===
The oldest tombstones in the cemetery come from the end of the 19th century. The decor of the cemetery is rich in details of small architecture: turrets, terraces and miniatures of ancient temples. Hilly terrain with dignified old trees additionally enhances the aesthetic value of this place.

In the cemetery there are seven groups of sculptures referring to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, two fountains and about sixty historic tombstones, the oldest of which is from 1896. There are also statues of angels, gates, balustrades and walls with engraved verses from the Holy Scriptures.

At the entrance to the cemetery there is a tombstone of Fr. Wacław Rabczyński, who with his hard work contributed to the construction of the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of Mercy in 1958-1966, as well as the chapel with accompanying facilities in Święta Woda. Thanks to him, unusual cemetery sculptures were created

In 2002, the Wasilków cemetery was entered into the register of monuments. For many years, the Society of the Friends of the Wasilkow Region has carried out fundraising activities for the renovation of historic figures in the cemetery.

=== Jewish cemetery ===
It was established at the end of the 19th century. A dozen or so matzevot have survived to this day, but there are probably more of them under a thick layer of earth. Metal stars of David have been placed in the place of the entrance gate.

In June 2007, a stone path and a lapidarium were made in the cemetery commemorating the Jews who lived in Wasilków before World War II. For the construction of the monument, found fragments of matzevot.

The first Jews settled in Wasilków in 1650. They came from the nearby Choroszcz and in 1714 established an independent Jewish community. At the end of the 19th century, as many as 1,470 people lived in the town of 3,800 inhabitants of the Jewish faith. About a thousand of them lived here before World War II. The cemetery is a special, historical place that honors the victims of the German occupation and attracts followers of all religions.

=== Sanctuary of Our Lady of Sorrows &quot;Holy Water&quot; ===

On the outskirts of Wasilków - by the national road No. 19 - there is the &quot;Holy Water&quot; Sanctuary. It owes its name to the spring around which there are many legends related to healing dating back to the Middle Ages. The first documented mention of the uniqueness of this place comes from 1719, in which a man named Basil, after washing his face, regained his eyesight, which he had lost two years earlier. As a gratitude, the nobleman donated a wooden chapel, which stood over the spring.

After many historical turmoil (the later brick chapel was destroyed by the Red Army during World War II), the reconstruction of this place was undertaken by Rev. Wacław Rabczyński in the 1950s.

<text>Zabłudów (; ) is a town in Białystok County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland, seat of Gmina Zabłudów.

==History==

The town of Zabłudów was founded in 1553, it was also granted Magdeburg town rights. An annual fair and weekly market were established. It was a private town which in the late 16th century passed successively to the families of Pac, Sapieha, Leszczyński, Sanguszko, and from 1598 until the beginning of the 19th century it was owned by the Radziwiłł family. In the 17th century, there were guilds of tailors, shoemakers and potters; agriculture also developed. Also in the 17th century, Protestants, including the Polish Brethren, as well as Jews, settled in the town. In 1654, King John II Casimir Vasa confirmed Zabłudów&#x27;s town rights and granted the coat of arms. In 1659 during the Russian-Polish War it was destroyed by invading Russian forces.

It was annexed by Prussia during the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. In 1800, the Prussian administration ordered the demolition of the local Catholic church, Germanisation attempts began, in 1803 a German school was founded. In 1807 the town passed to the Russian Partition of Poland. Initially, Polish language was briefly restored to schools and offices, but soon Russification began. The marching Russian troops during the Polish November Uprising in 1831 brought a cholera epidemic. Later, similar to other cities in the region such as Białystok and Supraśl, the textile industry developed.
The town was home to a thriving Jewish community for hundreds of years. It was once the location of the notable Zabłudów Synagogue, a wooden synagogue of a type unique to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, built in 1637. A replica of the Zabłudów synagogue was made in 2004 at the University of Wisconsin in the course study.

During World War II, Zabłudów was occupied by the Soviets from 1939 to 1941 and by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944. Upon entering Zabłudów, the Germans burned part of the town, destroying the Zabłudów Synagogue in June 1941, and in July 1941, they created a ghetto for some 1,800 Polish Jews from the vicinity. On 2 November 1942, the ghetto was liquidated by Germans and the Blue Police and approximately 1,400 Jews were transported by Holocaust trains to the 10th Cavalry camp near Białystok and from there to the Treblinka extermination camp on November 10. All were gassed that day. A few dozen managed to hide from the ghetto roundup, though most of those were found and shot. Several local Polish and Belarusian families did shelter some Jews, but in May, 1945, seven of the ten survivors were shot by an armed Polish gang.

Prior to 1999 it was part of the Białystok Voivodeship (1975–1998).

<text>Brańsk (Podlachian language: &quot;Бранськ, Branśk&quot;, , ) is a town in eastern Poland. It is situated within Podlaskie Voivodeship (province).

==Etymology==
The name of the town comes from the river Bronka, a nearby tributary of the Nurzec River.

==Geography==
===Location===
Brańsk is located in the geographical region of Europe known as the &quot;Wysoczyzny Podlasko–Białoruskie&quot; (English: Podlaskie and Belarus Plateau) and the mesoregion known as the Bielsk Plain (Polish: &quot;Równina Bielska&quot;). The Nurzec River, a tributary of the Bug River, passes through Brańsk. The town covers an area of .

It is located approximately: 
* northeast of Warsaw, the capital of Poland
* southwest of Białystok, the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship
* west of Bielsk Podlaski, the seat of Bielsk County

===Climate===
The region has a continental climate characterized by high temperatures during summer and long and frosty winters. The average annual rainfall exceeds .
==History==
On 23–25 June 1264 the Battle of Brańsk was fought in the town&#x27;s vicinity. Polish forced led by Duke Boleslaw V the Chaste defeated the forces of Yotvingia led by Komata (&quot;Kumata&quot;).

On 18 January 1493, Brańsk received a town charter based on Magdeburg rights from the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Alexander Jagiellon. It was the first town in Podlachia to receive such a charter.
Brańsk was a royal town of Poland, administratively located in the Podlaskie Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. The 3rd Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in Brańsk before the Third Partition of Poland. In 1795, as a result of the Third Partition of Poland, Brańsk was annexed to the Kingdom of Prussia and administered as a part of the newly formed Białystok Department. In 1807, as a result of the Treaties of Tilsit, Brańsk was annexed to the Russian Empire and administered at first as a part of Belostok Oblast and from 1842 on as a part of Grodno Governorate. The town was reintegrated with Poland, after the country regained independence following World War I in 1918.

===World War II===
On 1 September 1939 Germany attacked Poland and started World War II. Within days of the war&#x27;s beginning, Brańsk suffered German bombardment. On 17 September 1939 the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east, and in partnership with Nazi Germany, partitioned Poland under the terms of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 23. Brańsk along with all areas of Poland east of the Bug River was then occupied by the Soviet Union. All Polish and Jewish businesses of substance were confiscated by the Communist State. Several Poles from Brańsk were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in 1940. The Soviets remained in control of Brańsk until June 1941 when the Germans invaded their erstwhile Soviet allies.

The German Army occupied the town and ordered the Jewish community to build a ghetto surrounded by barbed wire, to which the Jewish population (some 65% of the town) was confined. On 8 November 1942 the Jews of Brańsk were ordered to report to the town center, forced to march to the nearby town of Bielsk, and then transported by train to Treblinka. Within weeks, the vast majority were murdered by gassing at the Treblinka extermination camp. Several local Jews were hidden and rescued by Poles (including the local parish priest) in Brańsk and nearby villages. Some hiding places in nearby villages were discovered by the Germans, who then murdered captured Jews. Their Polish rescuers were either also murdered or managed to hide from the Germans until the end of the German occupation.

On 1 August 1944 the town was captured by Soviet forces. On 4 August 1944 the Russians arrested 12 officers of the Polish underground Home Army in Brańsk, after they were deceitfully gathered for a supposed formal meeting with the command of the Soviet 65th Army. The town was soon restored to Poland.

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to the 1921 census, the town was inhabited by 3,739 people, among whom 1,474 were Roman Catholic, 100 Orthodox, and 2,165 Jewish. At the same time, 1,530 inhabitants declared Polish nationality, 2,165 Jewish, 32 Belarusian and 12 Russian. There were 493 residential buildings in the village.

<text>Sîn-šar-iškun ( or , meaning &quot;Sîn has established the king&quot;)&quot;&quot; was the penultimate king of Assyria, reigning from the death of his brother and predecessor Aššur-etil-ilāni in 627 BC to his own death at the Fall of Nineveh in 612 BC. 

Succeeding his brother in uncertain, but not necessarily violent circumstances, Sîn-šar-iškun was immediately faced by the revolt of one of his brother&#x27;s chief generals, Sîn-šumu-līšir, who attempted to usurp the throne for himself. Though Sîn-šumu-līšir was defeated relatively quickly, the instability caused by his revolt, combined with an ongoing interregnum in Babylonia in the south (neither Sîn-šar-iškun nor Sîn-šumu-līšir had formally proclaimed themselves as kings of Babylon) might be what made it possible for Nabopolassar, a southerner of unclear origin, to rise up and seize power in Babylonia. Sîn-šar-iškun&#x27;s inability to defeat Nabopolassar, despite repeated attempts over the course of several years, allowed Nabopolassar to consolidate power and form the Neo-Babylonian Empire, restoring Babylonian independence after more than a century of Assyrian rule.

The Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the newly formed Median Empire under Cyaxares, then invaded the Assyrian heartland. In 614 BC, the Medes captured and sacked Assur, the ceremonial and religious heart of the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC their combined armies attacked, brutally sacked, and razed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital. Sîn-šar-iškun&#x27;s fate is unknown but it is assumed that he died in the defense of his capital. He was succeeded as king only by Aššur-uballiṭ II, possibly his son, who rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at the city of Harran.

Despite the catastrophic fall of Assyria during his time as king, there is nothing to suggest that Sîn-šar-iškun was any less competent than his successful warrior-king predecessors. He employed the same tactics as his predecessors and appears to have utilized his forces rationally and strategically, fighting entirely in-line with traditional Assyrian warfare. What doomed Assyria might instead have been the lack of an effective defensive plan for the Assyrian heartland, which had not been invaded in five hundred years, combined with having to face an enemy which aimed to outright destroy Assyria rather than simply conquer it.

== Background ==

=== Chronology ===
As a consequence of Assyria&#x27;s violent downfall,&#x27; the period from a few years before the death of Ashurbanipal to the Fall of Nineveh in 612 BC suffers from a distinct lack of surviving sources. The annals of Ashurbanipal, the primary sources for his reign, go no further than 636 BC.&#x27; Although Ashurbanipal&#x27;s final year is often repeated as 627 BC&#x27;, this follows an inscription at Harran made by the mother of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of Nippur made in 631 BC.&#x27; To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, most scholars agree that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC. Of the three options, a death in 631 BC is the most accepted. If Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign would have ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors Aššur-etil-ilāni and Sîn-šar-iškun in Babylon, covering several years, would have been impossible since the city was seized by the Neo-Babylonian king Nabopolassar in 626 BC to never again fall into Assyrian hands.

Ashurbanipal had named his successor as early as 660 BC, when documents referencing a crown prince (probably Aššur-etil-ilāni) were written. He had been the father of at least one son, and probably two, early on in his reign. These early sons were likely Aššur-etil-ilāni and Sîn-šar-iškun.&#x27; Aššur-etil-ilāni succeeded Ashurbanipal as king in 631 BC and ruled until his own death in 627 BC. It is frequently assumed, without any supporting evidence, that Sîn-šar-iškun fought with Aššur-etil-ilāni for the throne.&#x27;

Sîn-šar-iškun has sometimes historically and erroneously been known as &quot;Esarhaddon II&quot; after a letter written by Šērūʾa-ēṭirat, a daughter of Sîn-šar-iškun&#x27;s grandfather Esarhaddon. The chronology and relations of the royal family were uncertain and Šērūʾa-ēṭirat was believed to have been too young to refer to the famous Esarhaddon. The idea of a separate Esarhaddon II as king has been abandoned by Assyriologists since the late 19th century,&quot; but the name sometimes appears as a synonym of Sîn-šar-iškun.

=== Assyria and Babylonia ===
In the middle of the seventh century BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire ruled the entire Near East. Due to their powerful standing army and their sophisticated administration, the Assyrians had managed to create the best organized and largest empire that the world had yet seen.&quot; Though Babylonia in the south had also once been a large kingdom, it had typically been weaker than its northern neighbor due to internal divisions and the lack of a well-organized army. The population of Babylonia was divided into various ethnic groups with different priorities and ideals. Though old native Babylonians ruled most of the cities, such as Kish, Ur, Uruk, Borsippa, Nippur, and Babylon itself, the Chaldean tribes, led by chieftains who often squabbled with each other, dominated most of the southernmost land. The Arameans lived on the fringes of settled land and were notorious for plundering surrounding territories. Because of the infighting of these three major groups, Babylonia often represented an appealing target for Assyrian campaigns. The two kingdoms had competed since the rise of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the 14th century BC, and in the 8th century BC, the Assyrians consistently gained the upper hand. Babylon&#x27;s internal and external weakness led to its conquest by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 729 BC.

During the expansion of Assyria into a major empire, the Assyrians had conquered various neighboring kingdoms, either annexing them as Assyrian provinces or turning them into vassal states. Because the Assyrians venerated the long history and culture of Babylon, it was preserved as a full kingdom, either ruled by an appointed client king, or by the Assyrian king in a personal union. The relationship between Assyria and Babylonia was similar to the relationship between Greece and Rome in later centuries; much of Assyria&#x27;s culture, texts and traditions had been imported from the south. Assyria and Babylonia also shared the same language (Akkadian). The relationship between Assyria and Babylon was emotional in a sense; Neo-Assyrian inscriptions implicitly gender the two countries, calling Assyria the metaphorical &quot;husband&quot; and Babylon its &quot;wife&quot;. In the words of the Assyriologist Eckart Frahm, &quot;the Assyrians were in love with Babylon, but also wished to dominate her&quot;. Though Babylon was respected as the well-spring of civilization, it was expected to remain passive in political matters, something that Assyria&#x27;s &quot;Babylonian bride&quot; repeatedly refused to be.

The Assyrians attempted various strategies to appease their Babylonian subjects throughout the eighth and seventh centuries BC; ranging from violent subjugation through war to direct rule either by the Assyrian king or by a representative (sometimes a relative such as a son or brother). Though there was some success in pacifying the urban population of Babylonians, the Arameans and Chaldeans remained unconvinced and repeatedly rebelled whenever they saw an opportunity. Despite the enormous effort spent in keeping the region, Babylonia was seen as too important economically and strategically to allow to secede, but no matter what the Assyrians attempted, rebellion and civil war was the inevitable result each time. Prolonged Assyrian control of Babylonia proved so impossible that modern researchers have dubbed it the &quot;Babylonian problem&quot;.&quot;&quot;

== Reign ==

=== Rise to the throne and revolt of Sîn-šumu-līšir ===

In the middle of 627 BC, Ashurbanipal&#x27;s son and successor Aššur-etil-ilāni died, leading to Aššur-etil-ilāni&#x27;s brother Sîn-šar-iškun ascending to the Assyrian throne. Although it has been suggested by several historians, there is no evidence to prove the idea that Aššur-etil-ilāni was deposed in a coup by his brother. Sîn-šar-iškun&#x27;s inscriptions state that he was selected for the kingship from among several of &quot;his equals&quot; (i.e., his brothers) by the gods.&quot;

Also dying at roughly the same time as Aššur-etil-ilāni was the vassal king of Babylon, Kandalanu, which led to Sîn-šar-iškun also becoming the ruler of Babylon, as proven by inscriptions by him in southern cities such as Nippur, Uruk, Sippar and Babylon itself.&#x27; Sîn-šar-iškun&#x27;s rule of Babylon did not last long, and almost immediately in the wake of him coming to the throne, the general Sîn-šumu-līšir rebelled. Sîn-šumu-līšir had been a key figure in Assyria during Aššur-etil-ilāni&#x27;s reign, putting down several revolts and possibly being the leader of the country. The rise of another king might have endangered his position and as such led him to revolt and attempt to seize power for himself.&#x27; Sîn-šumu-līšir was a eunuch and the only eunuch to claim the throne of Assyria. The possibility that a eunuch, normally trusted due to their perceived lack of political ambition, would do so had never been entertained prior to Sîn-šumu-līšir&#x27;s attempt.&quot;

Sîn-šumu-līšir successfully seized control of some cities in northern Babylonia, including Nippur and Babylon itself and would rule there for three months before Sîn-šar-iškun defeated him. Though both of them exercised control there, it is unclear if Sîn-šar-iškun and Sîn-šumu-līšir actually claimed the title &quot;king of Babylon&quot; (or only used &quot;king of Assyria&quot;), meaning that Babylonia could have experienced an interregnum of sorts. Modern historians typically include both Sîn-šumu-līšir and Sîn-šar-iškun in lists of Babylonian kings, as did some ancient Babylonian king lists.

=== Rise of Babylon under Nabopolassar ===
Some months after Sîn-šumu-līšir&#x27;s revolt, another revolt began in Babylon. An official or general called Nabopolassar, possibly using the political instability caused by the previous revolt and the ongoing interregnum in the south, assaulted both Nippur and Babylon. Nabopolassar&#x27;s armies took the cities from the garrisons left there by Sîn-šar-iškun but the Assyrian response was swift and in October of 626 BC, the Assyrian army recaptured Nippur and besieged Nabopolassar at Uruk. A simultaneous Assyrian attempt at recapturing Babylon itself, the last Assyrian action against the city, was repulsed by Nabopolassar&#x27;s garrison and the attack at Uruk also failed.

In the aftermath of the failed Assyrian counterattack, Nabopolassar was formally crowned king of Babylon on November 22/23 626 BC, restoring Babylonia as an independent kingdom. In 625–623 BC, Sîn-šar-iškun&#x27;s forces again attempted to defeat Nabopolassar, campaigning in northern Babylonia. Initially, these campaigns were successful; in 625 BC the Assyrians took the city of Sippar and Nabopolassar&#x27;s attempted reconquest of Nippur failed. Another of Assyria&#x27;s vassals, Elam, also stopped paying tribute to Assyria during this time and several Babylonian cities, such as Der, revolted and joined Nabopolassar. Realizing the threat this posed, Sîn-šar-iškun led a massive counterattack himself which saw the successful recapture of Uruk in 623 BC.

Sîn-šar-iškun might have ultimately been victorious had it not been for another revolt, led by an Assyrian general in the empire&#x27;s western provinces in 622 BC. This general, whose name remains unknown, took advantage of the absence of Sîn-šar-iškun and the Assyrian army to march on Nineveh, met a hastily organized army which surrendered without fighting and successfully seized the Assyrian throne. The surrender of the army indicates that the usurper was an Assyrian and possibly even a member of the royal family, or at least a person that would be acceptable as king.&#x27; Understandably alarmed by this development, Sîn-šar-iškun abandoned his Babylonian campaign and though he successfully defeated the usurper after a hundred days of civil war, the absence of the Assyrian army saw the Babylonians conquer the last remaining Assyrian outposts in Babylonia in 622–620 BC. The Babylonian siege of Uruk had begun by October 622 BC and though control of the ancient city would shift between Assyria and Babylon, it was firmly in Nabopolassar&#x27;s hands by 620 BC. Nippur was also conquered in 620 BC and Nabopolassar pushed the Assyrians out of Babylonia. Though he had successfully driven out the Assyrian army, pro-Assyrian factions still existed in some Babylonian cities, for instance Ur and Nippur, by 617 BC, making Nabopolassar&#x27;s full consolidation of control in the south slow.&#x27; The fighting in Babylonia in the last stages of the localized conflict turned conditions so desperate in some places that parents sold their children into slavery to avoid them starving to death.

=== Fighting in Assyria ===
While unlikely to have been received positively, the end of Assyrian rule in Babylonia would probably not have been regarded as significant to the Assyrians at the time. All fighting had happened in Babylonia and the outcome was not yet decisive, characteristic of previous Assyro-Babylonian conflicts in the Neo-Assyrian period. In previous uprisings, the Babylonians had sometimes temporarily gained the upper hand as well and there was no reason to believe that Nabopolassar&#x27;s success would be anything but a temporary inconvenience.&quot;&quot;

In 616 BC, Nabopolassar entered Assyrian territory for the first time, leading his armies along the Euphrates river into lands in present-day Syria. As he marched on, he took the Assyrian city Hindanu and reached the Balikh River, where he defeated an Assyrian force near the city Gablinu. Nabopolassar then pushed north, reaching as far as the Khabur River. The Assyrians swiftly regrouped in order to deal with the threat.&#x27; Realizing that the situation was dire, Assyria&#x27;s ally, Pharaoh Psamtik I of Egypt, marched his troops to aid Sîn-šar-iškun. Psamtik had over the last few years campaigned to establish dominance over the small city-states of the Levant and it was in his interests that Assyria survived as a buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and Medes in the east. A joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign to capture the city of Gablinu was undertaken in October of 616 BC, but ended in failure after which the Egyptian allies kept to the west of the Euphrates, only offering limited support. Both the Assyrians and the Babylonians then withdrew, though the Babylonians retained Hindanu and now controlled the middle Euphrates, a major strategical victory and probably the first step in Nabopolassar&#x27;s plan to counteract the possibility of an Assyrian invasion of Babylonia. That Nabopolassar withdrew at the same time as the Assyrians did suggests that the Babylonians were not yet ready to conduct a full invasion of Assyria and that their plans were at this time just to secure Babylonian independence, not to conquer and destroy Assyria.&#x27;

In March 615 BC, Nabopolassar inflicted a crushing defeat on the Assyrian army at the banks of the Tigris, pushing them back to the Little Zab.&#x27; This victory weakened Assyrian control of the buffer zone that had established around the middle of the Tigris river between the two kingdoms, meaning that the Babylonians now controlled lands directly bordering the Assyrian heartland itself.&#x27;

=== Fall of the Assyrian Empire ===
In May 615 BC, Nabopolassar and the Babylonians assaulted Assur, the ceremonial and religious center of Assyria and the Assyrian Empire&#x27;s southernmost remaining city. Sîn-šar-iškun swiftly rallied his army and counterattacked, lifting the siege of Assur and forcing Nabopolassar to retreat to the city of Takrit. There, Sîn-šar-iškun besieged Nabopolassar, but he was eventually forced to abandon the siege.&#x27; Though the conflict had shifted to Assyria becoming the defender, the war was at this point still being fought according to standard Mesopotamian practice, with attacks, counterattacks and retreats and neither side having the confidence or means to force a decisive confrontation. Despite constant defeats and setbacks, the Assyrian army remained powerful and capable of being deployed rapidly.&#x27;

In late 615 BC or in 614 BC,&#x27; the Medes under their king Cyaxares entered Assyria and conquered the region around the city of Arrapha in preparation for a campaign against Sîn-šar-iškun. Although there are plenty of earlier sources discussing Assyro-Median relations, none are preserved from the period leading up to Cyaxares&#x27;s invasion and as such, the political context and reasons for the sudden attack are not known.&#x27; Perhaps, the war between Babylonia and Assyria had disrupted the economy of the Medes and inspired a direct intervention.&quot;&quot;

In July or August of 614 BC, the Medes mounted attacks on the cities of Nimrud and Nineveh and successfully conquered the city of Tarbisu. They then besieged Assur. This siege was successful and the Medes captured the ancient heart of Assyria, plundering it and killing many of its inhabitants. The brutal sack of Assur came as a shock to people throughout the Near East. Even the Babylonian chronicles, hostile to Assyria, speak of the Medes as unnecessarily brutal, stating that they &quot;inflicted a terrible defeat on a great people, pillaged and looted them and robbed them&quot;.&#x27; Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares, allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact. The treaty between the Babylonians and Medes was sealed through the marriage of Nabopolassar&#x27;s son and heir, Nebuchadnezzar, and Cyaxares&#x27;s daughter, Amytis. The onset of winter after the fall of Assur meant that both the Medes and Babylonians then returned to their homelands, preparing for further campaigns in the next year. The Assyrians appear to have not recognized the severity of their situation as they did not use the pause in the fighting to fall back into, and prepare, defensive positions. Instead of repairing the damage in Nimrud, the populace there dismantled the walls further to prepare for future renovation work (which would never happen).&#x27;

In an attempt to keep the enemies out of Assyria, Sîn-šar-iškun went on the offensive in 613 BC, attacking Nabopolassar&#x27;s forces in the middle Euphrates, occupied at the time with suppressing an Assyrian-supported rebellion of a local tribe.&#x27; Sinshariskun successfully rescued the tribe&#x27;s besieged city of Rahilu, but Nabopolassar&#x27;s army retreated before a battle could take place. Around this time, Sîn-šar-iškun, apparently finally recognizing the disaster that was about to befall his kingdom, sent a letter to Nabopolassar, attempting to broker peace. Sîn-šar-iškun pleaded with Nabopolassar to avoid any more bloodshed and wrote that he should &quot;quiet his fuery heart&quot;. Nabopolassar was not interested; Sîn-šar-iškun had waited too long and there was no longer anything he could offer that the Babylonians and Medes would not be able to take for themselves in battle. A harsh response was sent, in which Nabopolassar declared that &quot;[Nineveh&#x27;s] roots I shall pluck out and the foundations of the land I shall obliterate&quot;.&#x27; The original tablets containing these letters have not been preserved, with the known text instead having been derived from tablets made during Seleucid times, centuries later. Whether the letters are copies of authentic, more ancient, originals, or fabrications entirely is a matter of debate.

In April or May 612 BC, at the start of Nabopolassar&#x27;s fourteenth year as king of Babylon, the combined Medo-Babylonian army marched on Nineveh. Sîn-šar-iškun rallied his forces to make a final stand at the capital but stood little chance at defending it on account of the city&#x27;s massive size.&#x27; From June to August 612 BC, the Medo-Babylonian army besieged the Assyrian capital and in August the walls were breached, leading to a lengthy and brutal sack. The city was looted, depictions of the Assyrian kings were mutilated and inhabitants as young as the age of ten were slaughtered en masse before the entire city was razed and burned to the ground.&#x27; Sîn-šar-iškun&#x27;s fate is not entirely certain but it is commonly accepted that he died in the defense of Nineveh.

=== Succession ===
With the destructions of Assur in 614 BC and Nineveh in 612 BC, the Assyrian Empire had essentially ceased to exist. Sîn-šar-iškun was succeeded by another Assyrian king, Aššur-uballiṭ II, possibly his son and probably the same person as a crown prince mentioned in inscriptions at Nineveh from 626 and 623 BC. Aššur-uballiṭ established himself at Harran in the west. Because Assur had been destroyed, Aššur-uballiṭ could not undergo the traditional coronation of the Assyrian monarchs and could thus not be invested with the kingship by the god Ashur and because of this, inscriptions from his brief reign indicate that he was viewed as the legitimate ruler by his subjects, but still with the title of crown prince and not king. To the Assyrians, Sîn-šar-iškun was the last true king.

Aššur-uballiṭ&#x27;s rule at Harran lasted just three years and he fled the city when Nabopolassar&#x27;s army approached in 610 BC. An attempt at recapturing Harran carried out with the remnants of the Assyrian army and Egyptian reinforcements in 609 BC failed, after which Aššur-uballiṭ and the Assyrians he commanded disappear from history, never again to be mentioned in Babylonian sources.

The Biblical Book of Nahum &quot;prophetically&quot; discusses the Fall of Nineveh, but it is unclear when it was written. It may have been written as early as during Ashurbanipal&#x27;s Egyptian campaign in the 660s BC, or as late as around the time of Nineveh&#x27;s actual fall. If it was written around 612 BC, the &quot;king of Assyria&quot; mentioned would be Sîn-šar-iškun.

=== Reasons for the fall of Assyria ===
Although it has been a commonly circulated idea that one of the primary reasons that led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire was a civil war between Aššur-etil-ilāni and Sîn-šar-iškun over the throne which weakened Assyria, there is no contemporary text which suggests that this is true. No inscriptions mention a war or even a dispute between the two brothers. There were revolts at the beginnings of both the reign of Aššur-etil-ilāni and Sîn-šar-iškun, but these were minor and dealt with relatively quickly. As such, protracted civil war between contenders to the Assyrian throne was probably not the reason for Assyria&#x27;s fall.

The primary reason for Assyria&#x27;s collapse in the reign of Sîn-šar-iškun is more likely to be the failure to resolve the &quot;Babylonian problem&quot; which had plagued Assyrian kings since Assyria first conquered southern Mesopotamia. Despite the many attempts of the kings of the Sargonid dynasty to resolve the constant rebellions in the south in a variety of different ways; Sennacherib&#x27;s destruction of Babylon and Esarhaddon&#x27;s restoration of it, rebellions and insurrections remained common. Nabopolassar&#x27;s revolt was the last in a long line of Babylonian uprisings against the Assyrians and Sîn-šar-iškun&#x27;s failure to stop it, despite trying for years, doomed his kingdom. The Neo-Babylonian threat, combined with the rise of the Median Empire (Assyria had for many years attempted to stop the formation of a unified Median state through repeated campaigns into Media) culminated in Assyria&#x27;s destruction.

It would be easy to ascribe Assyria&#x27;s catastrophic defeat to a weakened Assyrian military and an incompetent king, but there is no evidence to suggest that Sîn-šar-iškun was an incompetent ruler.&quot;&quot; Assyria was unprepared for foreign attacks into its heartland since the heartland had not been penetrated for five hundred years; no defensive plan existed because in their experience one had never been needed. Sîn-šar-iškun did not use his forces to defend his territory, instead repeatedly going on the offensive, but he kept entirely faithful to the traditional ways of Assyrian warfare. He used the proven principles of war, as used by his successful ancestors before him; supporting rebellions in enemy countries, using flanking maneuvers, concentrating on one point of the position of the enemy and pressing the attack through taking the war to the enemy. Using alternate tactics probably never occurred to him and with an Assyrian mindset considered, he appears to have been a capable military leader who deployed his forces rationally and strategically. In a normal war, he might have been victorious, but he was wholly unprepared to go on the defensive against an enemy that was both numerically superior and that aimed to destroy his country rather than conquer it.

<text>Andrychów (, , hist. also &quot;Andrychau&quot;) is the largest town in Wadowice County, Lesser Poland Voivodeship, Poland. The town is located in the Little Beskids, in the historical region of Lesser Poland, on the river Wieprzówka. It has been situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship since 1999, having previously been located in the Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship (1975–1998). Andrychów has an area of and as of June 2022 it has 18,815 inhabitants.

==History==
The settlement dates back to the late 13th century. First recorded mention of it comes from 1344&#x27;s Peter&#x27;s Pence, and it was called Henrychów (ecclesia de Henrichov). Other names used for Andrychów in the past are Indrzychów and Gendrzychów. During the German occupation of Poland, it was renamed into Andrichau. Historians claim that the name of the town comes from a Polish given name Jędrzej (Andrzej).

Andrychów was first mentioned in the records of Peter&#x27;s Pence in 1344 as a small village in the Duchy of Zator, however an existing church was already mentioned in 1325. In 1345 Andrychów is said to have population of 105 and to cover the area of . Most likely, its first residents were settlers from Klatovy in southern Bohemia. Jan Długosz in his Liber beneficiorum calls it Gendrychów, writing that it was a small village in the Silesian Duchy of Zator. In ca. 1440 the Zator Castle was captured by Polish troops, and finally, the Duchy of Zator, together with Duchy of Oświęcim were incorporated into Kingdom of Poland on February 20, 1564, as Silesian County of Kraków Voivodeship, Lesser Poland.

During the reign of Zygmunt August, Andrychów emerged as an administrative center of the area. The village belonged to the family of Schilling, who supported Protestant Reformation. In 1655, during the Swedish invasion of Poland, Andrychów was burned by Swedish units heading for Żywiec. In 1704, first attempt to grant town charter to Andrychów took place, but it did not succeed. Three years later the village was once again burned to the ground by the Swedes, during the Great Northern War. After the destruction, Andrychów&#x27;s owner invited weavers from Silesia, Belgium and Saxony, and as a result, Andrychów became an important center of weaving. Finally, in 1767 it received town charter from King Stanisław August Poniatowski.

In the summer 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), Andrychów was seized by the Austrian troops. New authorities changed its name into Andrichau, and until November 1918, it remained in Austrian province of Galicia. For some time, both the village of Andrychów and the town of Andrychów existed. In 1778 the village had the population of 598, and the town 2,475. In 1791, first school was opened in the town. In the mid-1800s, the Industrial Revolution reached Andrychów, together with an influx of Jewish settlers, for whom a synagogue was built in 1884. On June 27, 1868, the town and the village were merged, and two years later, Andrychów received its first rail connection. On June 20, 1893, large parts of the town burned in a fire.

In the Second Polish Republic Andrychów belonged to Kraków Voivodeship. In 1926 the town was electrified, and in 1934–1939, several public works projects were carried out, including a sewage system, improved road system, a swimming pool and a municipal stadium. First gas station was opened in 1929, and since 1926, the town had regular bus connections with Kraków and Bielsko-Biała.

On September 4, 1939, Andrychów was captured by the Wehrmacht at the beginning of World War II. The town was incorporated directly into the Third Reich, and on November 24, 1939, the Germans burned the local synagogue. They conscripted Jews for forced labor and beat and tortured members of the Jewish community. In September, 1941, the Germans established a Jewish ghetto in a poor part of town, with the displaced Poles taking over Jewish houses. The Jewish community continued to worship, organized clandestine schools for their children, and established a day care and public kitchens to feed the hungry. In July 1942, the Germans rounded up the Jewish population. About 100 ill and unfit were sent to Wadowice and from there to be murdered at Belzec. Another 40 were sent to Auschwitz where most were immediately murdered or perished later from starvation, beatings, or disease. More than 100 were sent to labor camps and another 60 to the Wadowice ghetto.

Later some Jews who had been sent to the Wadowice ghetto were sent back to Andrychów because their labor was needed. In July 1943, the men in this group were sent to other labor camps and in November, the women were sent to Auschwitz. About 25 Jews from Andrychów were thought to have survived the Holocaust.

Germans retreated westwards on January 26, 1945, and next day Andrychów was captured by the Red Army. In the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, Andrychów was an important center of textile industry, with a large cotton plant (Zakłady Przemysłu Bawełnianego). Another important factory was Andrychów Machine Works (Andrychowska Fabryka Maszyn), which was based on the German World War II era factory Areo-Stall Werke.

==Transport==
===Road transport===
Andrychów lies at the intersection of national road 52 (Kraków–Bielsko-Biała) and voivodeship road 781 (Chrzanów–Łękawica). Public transport is provided by buses of the Intercommune Transit Authority (Międzygminny Zakład Komunikacyjny) Andrychów–Kęty–Porąbka, which has 18 lines, including 6 in Andrychów itself.

===Rail transport===
Andrychów has a railway station along the railway line 117 (Bielsko-Biała Główna–Kalwaria Zebrzydowska Lanckorona).

==Tourism==
Andrychów is a tourist centre in the Little Beskids. Tourist attractions include the old town with historic park, baroque church, an 18th-century manor and a Jewish cemetery. Andrychów has a developed tourist infrastructure: accommodation, theme parks, active recreation infrastructure and local museums.

<text>Żywiec (, ) is a town on the River Soła in southern Poland with 31,194 inhabitants (2019). It is situated within the Silesian Voivodeship, near the Żywiec Lake and Żywiec Landscape Park, one of the eight protected areas in the voivodeship. Historically, the town has been part of the Lesser Poland region and is the capital of the Żywiecczyzna region, which is ethnically part of the Goral Lands.

The 551231 Żywiec planetoid is named after the town.

==History==
Żywiec was first mentioned in a written document in 1308 as a seat of a Catholic parish. It was originally located in the place later known as &quot;Stary Żywiec&quot; (lit. &quot;Old Żywiec&quot;). It belonged then to the Duchy of Cieszyn, and after 1315 to the Duchy of Oświęcim, which in 1327 became a fief of the Kingdom of Bohemia. The town was a focal point for the development of hitherto sparsely populated Żywiec Basin. The area of Stary Żywiec was prone to flooding so the town was moved to the current spot in 1448. In 1457 the Duchy of Oświęcim was purchased and incorporated directly to the Polish Crown. Żywiec was a private town, administratively located in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. In 1624 it was sold by the Komorowski family to Constance of Austria, queen consort of the Polish king Sigismund III Vasa. During the Deluge, Żywiec was plundered and destroyed by Swedish troops in 1656. From 1672 it was a possession the Polish Chancellor Jan Wielopolski.

The Old Castle was built in the mid-14th century. The castle has undergone several restorations and boasts a number of styles of architecture and decoration, including Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque. Żywiec&#x27;s Old Castle is encompassed by a 260,000 square metre landscape park, which was established initially in the 17th century.
The Church of the Holy Cross was built towards the end of the 14th century, and expanded twice, once in 1679 and again in 1690. In the 18th century, a Baroque church was later constructed on the site and still stands today. A second noteworthy church, the Cathedral of the Virgin Mary&#x27;s Birth, was constructed and expanded during the first half of the 15th century, before being renovated in Baroque fashion after a fire in 1711.

Upon the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Żywiec became part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia. In 1810 it was purchased by Prince Albert of Saxony, son of King Augustus III of Poland and again ruled with the neighbouring Silesian Duchy of Teschen (Cieszyn). When he died in 1822, his estates fell to Archduke Charles from the Austrian House of Habsburg-Lorraine. The town also houses the Żywiec Brewery, established by Charles&#x27; son Archduke Albert in 1852, and purchased by Heineken International in the 1990s. A museum was founded at the site in 2006. At the beginning of World War I, over 1,000 soldiers of the Polish Legions from the region marched out from Żywiec to fight for Polish independence; 167 of them died in the war. At the end of the war, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the town. Eight Poles from Żywiec were killed in the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1920.

===Second World War===

Following the 1939 Invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Żywiec was occupied by Nazi Germany and annexed to the German Province of Upper Silesia (see East Upper Silesia). The last Habsburg owner Archduke Karl Albrecht of Austria refused to sign the German , whereafter he was ousted and arrested.

26 Poles from Żywiec were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940.

Between September and December 1940, the Nazi authorities expelled 17,413–20,000 Polish inhabitants from around Żywiec county in the so-called Action Saybusch conducted by the Wehrmacht and Gestapo. A transit camp for expelled Poles was located at the local school. The expelled Poles were taken to the General Government, a different region within Poland under German military occupation. The incident formed part of the Nazis&#x27; efforts, led by Reich Minister Alfred Rosenberg and his deputy Alfred Meyer, to develop the Occupied Eastern Territories for settlement by German migrants. In 1941, Nazi German of Upper Silesia Fritz Bracht, while visiting the town, declared that there will be no Poles in the county in five years. German occupation ended in 1945.
==Economy==
The Żywiec Brewery is located in the town. There is a museum dedicated to the brewery.

==Sports==
There are several football clubs in the town: men teams Koszarawa Żywiec, Czarni-Góral Żywiec, Soła Żywiec, and women team TS Mitech Żywiec. All four teams compete in the lower leagues, although Mitech also played in the Ekstraliga (Polish top division) until 2020.

<doc id="390468" wikidata="Q3646603" url="?curid=390468" title="Re-order buffer">
<text>A re-order buffer (ROB) is a hardware unit used in an extension to Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm to support out-of-order and speculative instruction execution. The extension forces instructions to be committed in-order.

The buffer is a circular buffer (to provide a FIFO instruction ordering queue) implemented as an array/vector (which allows recording of results against instructions as they complete out of order).

There are three stages to the Tomasulo algorithm: &quot;Issue&quot;, &quot;Execute&quot;, &quot;Write Result&quot;. In an extension to the algorithm, there is an additional &quot;Commit&quot; stage. During the Commit stage, instruction results are stored in a register or memory. The &quot;Write Result&quot; stage is modified to place results in the re-order buffer. Each instruction is tagged in the reservation station with its index in the ROB for this purpose.

The contents of the buffer are used for data dependencies of other instructions scheduled in the buffer. The head of the buffer will be committed once its result is valid. Its dependencies will have already been calculated and committed since they must be ahead of the instruction in the buffer though not necessarily adjacent to it. Data dependencies between instructions would normally stall the pipeline while an instruction waits for its dependent values. The ROB allows the pipeline to continue to process other instructions while ensuring results are committed in order to prevent data hazards such as read ahead of write (RAW), write ahead of read (WAR) and write ahead of write (WAW). 

There are additional fields in every entry of the buffer to support the extended algorithm:
* Instruction type (jump, store to memory, store to register)
* Destination (either memory address or register number)
* Result (value that goes to destination or indication of a (un)successful jump)
* Validity (does the result already exist?)

The consequences of the re-order buffer include precise exceptions and easy rollback control of target address mis-predictions (branch or jump). When jump prediction is not correct or a nonrecoverable exception is encountered in the instruction stream, the ROB is cleared of all instructions (by setting the circular queue tail to the head) and reservation stations are re-initialized.

<text>HMS &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; (pennant number 40) was a heavy cruiser of the British Royal Navy, named after the English county, now usually known as Dorset. The ship was a member of the &quot;Norfolk&quot; sub-class, of which was the only other unit; the County class comprised a further eleven ships in two other sub-classes. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was built at the Portsmouth Dockyard; her keel was laid in September 1927, she was launched in January 1929, and was completed in September 1930. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was armed with a main battery of eight guns, and had a top speed of .

&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; served initially in the Atlantic Fleet in the early 1930s, before moving to become the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Africa in 1933, and then to the China Station in late 1935. She remained there until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, when she was transferred to the South Atlantic. There, she reinforced the search for the German heavy cruiser . In late May 1941, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; took part in the final engagement with the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, which ended when &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was ordered to close and torpedo the crippled German battleship. She joined searches for the heavy cruiser in August and the auxiliary cruiser in November.

In March 1942, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was transferred to the Eastern Fleet to support British forces in the recently opened Pacific Theatre of the war. At the end of the month, the Japanese fast carrier task force—the &quot;Kido Butai&quot;—launched the Indian Ocean raid. On 5 April, Japanese aircraft spotted &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and her sister while en route to Colombo; a force of dive bombers then attacked the two ships and sank them. More than 1,100 men were rescued the next day, out of a combined crew of over 1,500.

==Description==

&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was at maximum long overall, and had a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at standard displacement, in compliance with the tonnage restriction of the Washington Naval Treaty, and up to at full load. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was propelled by four Parsons steam turbines that drove four screw propellers. Steam was provided by eight oil-fired 3-drum water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at and produced a top speed of . The ship had a capacity of of fuel oil as built, which provided a cruising radius of at a speed of . She had a crew of 710 officers and enlisted men.

&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was armed with a main battery of eight BL Mk VIII 50-cal. guns in four twin turrets, in two superfiring pairs forward and aft. As built, the cruiser had a secondary battery that included four dual-purpose guns (DP) in single mounts. She also carried four QF 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns, also in single mounts. Her armament was rounded out by eight torpedo tubes mounted in two quadruple launchers.

Unlike most heavy cruisers, the County-class cruisers dispensed with traditional belt armour and used side plating to protect the hulls against shell fragments only. The ammunition magazines received of armour plate on the sides. The gun turrets and their supporting barbettes also received only 1 in splinter protection.

In 1931, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; began to carry a seaplane; a catapult was installed the following year to allow her to launch the aircraft while underway. In 1937, her secondary battery was overhauled. Eight QF 4-inch Mk XVI DP guns in twin turrets replaced the single mounts, and the single 2-pounders were replaced with eight twin-mounts. During the Second World War, her anti-aircraft battery was strengthened by the addition of nine guns.

==Service history==
===Pre-war===
&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was laid down at the Portsmouth Dockyard on 21 September 1927 and was launched on 21 January 1929. After completing fitting-out work on 30 September 1930 she was commissioned into the Royal Navy. Upon commissioning, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; became the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron. In 1931, she was part of the Atlantic Fleet during the Invergordon Mutiny. During the incident, some of her men initially refused to assemble for duty but after an hour and a half, the ship&#x27;s officers had restored order and no further unrest troubled &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; during the mutiny. From 1933–1935, she served as the flagship for the Commander-in-Chief, Africa; she was replaced by . By September 1935, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was assigned to the China Station. From 1–4 February 1937, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;, the aircraft carrier and the cruiser participated in an exercise to test the defences of Singapore against a hypothetical Japanese attack.

===Second World War===
At the start of the Second World War in September 1939, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was still on the China Station. In October, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;—with other Royal Navy ships—was sent to South American waters in pursuit of the German heavy cruiser , which was attacking British merchant traffic in the area. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was assigned with her sister ship and the aircraft carrier . &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; had just arrived in Simonstown, South Africa, from Colombo on 9 December, with orders to proceed to Tristan da Cunha and then to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands to relieve . After departing Simonstown, she received the order to join the hunt for &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;. She left South Africa on 13 December in company with the cruiser and was in transit on 17 December when the Germans scuttled &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot; following the Battle of the River Plate.

&quot;Exeter&quot; had been badly damaged in the battle with &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before returning to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter &quot;Wakama&quot; off the coast of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank &quot;Wakama&quot; to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal complaint to the British government protesting against &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;″s violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the &quot;Wakama&quot; incident.

In May, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; underwent a short refit in Simonstown, before returning to Britain for a more thorough overhaul. On 23 June, she set out from Freetown to watch the French battleship , which left Dakar for Casablanca two days later. While &quot;en route&quot;, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; rendezvoused with the aircraft carrier &quot;Hermes&quot; off Dakar. &quot;Richelieu&quot; was ordered to return to Dakar by Admiral François Darlan later that day and she arrived on 27 June. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; continued to monitor the French Navy off Dakar and on 3 July, the French submarines and attempted to intercept her. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was able to evade their attacks through high-speed manoeuvres. On 5 July, &quot;Hermes&quot; and the Australian cruiser joined her there. On 7 July, the squadron was ordered to issue an ultimatum to the French fleet, to either surrender and be interned under British control or to scuttle their ships; the French refused, so a fast sloop was sent in to drop depth charges under the stern of &quot;Richelieu&quot; to disable her screws.

On 4 September, she was dry-docked at Durban and on the 20th she arrived back in Simonstown. She sailed for Sierra Leone the next day. Operating in the Indian Ocean, on 18 November she bombarded Zante in Italian Somaliland. On 18 December she departed to join the search for the heavy cruiser , which had recently sunk the British refrigerator ship &quot;Duquesa&quot; in the South Atlantic. The British were unsuccessful in their search and &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; remained at large.

====&quot;Bismarck&quot;====

By May 1941, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; had been assigned to Force H, along with the aircraft carrier , the battlecruiser , and the light cruiser . &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was at that time commanded by Captain Benjamin Martin. Late in the month, the German battleship and heavy cruiser broke out into the North Atlantic to attack convoys sailing for Britain, and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was one of the ships deployed to hunt the German raiders. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; had been escorting convoy SL74 from Sierra Leone to the UK on 26 May, when she received the order to leave the convoy and join the search for &quot;Bismarck&quot;; she was some south of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s location. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; steamed at top speed, though heavy seas later in the night forced her to reduce to and later to . By 08:33, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; encountered the destroyer , which had been engaging &quot;Bismarck&quot; throughout the night. The German battleship&#x27;s gun flashes could be seen, only away, by 08:50.

Shortly thereafter, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; took part in &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s last battle; after the battleships and neutralised &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s main battery early in the engagement, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and other warships—including her sister —closed in to join the attack. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; opened fire at a range of , but poor visibility forced her to check her fire for lengthy periods. In the course of the engagement, she fired 254 shells from her main battery. In the final moments of the battle, she was ordered to move closer and torpedo &quot;Bismarck&quot; and fired three torpedoes, two of which hit the crippled battleship. The Germans had by this time detonated scuttling charges, which with the damage inflicted by the British, caused &quot;Bismarck&quot; to rapidly sink at 10:40.

&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and the destroyer then moved in to pick up survivors. Martin had ropes lowered down the sides of the ship so the men in the water could climb aboard. A reported U-boat sighting forced the two ships to break off the rescue effort. Historians Holger Herwig and David Bercuson state that only 110 men were rescued: 85 aboard &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and 25 aboard &quot;Maori&quot;. Historian Angus Konstam, however, writes that his research indicated a total of 116 saved, 86 on &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; (one of whom died), 25 on &quot;Maori&quot;, 3 rescued by and a further 2 picked up by the German weather ship .

&quot;Rodney&quot;, &quot;King George V&quot; and the destroyers , and &quot;Cossack&quot; had meanwhile begun to steam north-west to return to Scapa Flow. After abandoning the rescue effort, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and &quot;Maori&quot; caught up with the rest of the fleet shortly after 12:00. Late that night, as the fleet steamed off Britain, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was detached to stop in the Tyne. She had suffered no casualties in the battle with &quot;Bismarck&quot;.

====Deployment to South Africa and the Indian Ocean====
In late August, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; participated in the search for the heavy cruiser . &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot; and the light cruiser left Freetown on 29 August, though they were unable to locate the German raider. On 4 November, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and the auxiliary cruiser , were sent to investigate reports of a German surface raider in the South Atlantic but neither ship found anything. In November–December, WS-24, a convoy of 10 troop transport ships, steamed out from Halifax, Canada en route to Basra, Iraq. After arriving in Cape Town on 9 December, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; took over the escort duties and the convoy was diverted to Bombay, where it arrived on 24 December.

&quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was deployed in November, to join the search for the German commerce raider , that had been attacking Allied shipping off the coast of Africa. Admiral Algernon Willis formed Task Force 3, with &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and to patrol likely refuelling locations for &quot;Atlantis&quot;. On 1 December, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; intercepted the German supply ship &quot;Python&quot;, based on Ultra intelligence. The German ship was refuelling a pair of U-boats— and —in the South Atlantic. The U-boats dived while &quot;Python&quot; tried to flee. &quot;UA&quot; fired five torpedoes at &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; but all missed her due to her evasive manoeuvres. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; fired a salvo to stop &quot;Python&quot; and the latter&#x27;s crew abandoned the ship, after detonating scuttling charges. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; left the Germans in their boats, since the U-boats still presented too much of a threat for the British to pick up the Germans.

====Loss====
In 1942, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;, under the command of Augustus Agar, was assigned to the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean. In March, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was assigned to Force A, which was commanded by Admiral James Somerville, with the battleship and the carriers and . Somerville received reports of an impending Japanese attack in the Indian Ocean—the Indian Ocean raid—and so he put his fleet to sea on 31 March. Having not encountered any hostile forces by 4 April, he withdrew to refuel. &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and her sister ship &quot;Cornwall&quot; were sent to Colombo to replenish their fuel.

The next day, she and &quot;Cornwall&quot; were spotted by reconnaissance aircraft from the heavy cruiser . The two British cruisers were attacked by a force of 53 Aichi D3A2 &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers southwest of Ceylon. In the span of about eight minutes, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; was hit by ten and bombs and several near misses; she sank stern first at about 13:50. One of the bombs detonated an ammunition magazine and contributed to her rapid sinking. &quot;Cornwall&quot; was hit eight times and sank bow first about ten minutes later. Between the two ships, 1,122 men out of a total of 1,546 were picked up by the cruiser and the destroyers and the next day.

<text>Krasnystaw is a town in southeastern Poland with 18,630 inhabitants (31 December 2019). It is the capital of Krasnystaw County in the Lublin Voivodeship.

The town is famous for its beer festival called &quot;Chmielaki&quot; ( means hop), and for its dairy products like yogurt and kefir. The river Wieprz flows through Krasnystaw.

== History ==

Krasnystaw received its town charter from King Władysław II Jagiełło, who signed the document in Kraków, on 1 March 1394. The new town was located in the location of previously existing village of Szczekarzew, and in 1490 – 1826, was property of the Bishops of Chełm, and the seat of a starosta. Due to convenient location along merchant route from Lublin to Lwów, it prospered in the 16th century.

The period known as Swedish wars (1655–1660) brought destruction of both the town and the Krasnystaw Castle. The 4th Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in Krasnystaw in 1790. Following the Third Partition of Poland, Krasnystaw was in 1795 annexed by the Habsburg Empire. After the Polish victory in the Austro-Polish War of 1809, it was part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution in 1815, until 1916, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During the January Uprising, the town and its area saw heavy fighting between Polish rebels and Russian troops.
In 1916, Krasnystaw received rail connection, and in 1919, already in the Second Polish Republic, the town became seat of a county.

On 18–19 September 1939, during the Invasion of Poland, Polish troops of the 39th Infantry Division fought here with advancing Wehrmacht units. During World War II, numerous units of the Home Army and others operated in the area. The Germans blamed Jews for the resistance, and hanged seven. They then placed 40 Jews on the German front lines. About one third were killed. During the first months of their occupation, the Germans murdered both Christian and Jewish Poles.

In 1940, the Germans established a Jewish ghetto in the poorest part of town. Over the next few years, Jews from other communities were moved to the ghetto, others moved out of it to other camps and ghettos. Finally, in May 1942, it became a transit ghetto where Jews were brought on their way to Majdanek or to the Sobibor extermination camp, where all were immediately murdered. Later in 1942, some of the remaining Krasnystaw Jews were sent to the Belzec extermination camp. Only a handful of Krasnystaw&#x27;s Jewish population of about 2500 survived.

In 1943, a local German prison was raided, and 300 inmates were released. In spring 1944, several German trains were destroyed. After the war, anti-Communist units operated here until 1950.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively part of the Chełm Voivodeship.

== Jewish community ==

The old synagogue of Krasnystaw, which was still standing at the beginning of the 20th century, had a number of 14th- and 15th-century architectural features. The municipal customs records of Krasnystaw for 1548 show a number of Jews resident in the town. In 1554, Jews were prohibited from owning dwelling houses in the town and suburbs, though in 1584 they were allowed to reside in the suburbs only. In 1761, three Jews from Wojslawice and one from Czarnoloz were convicted in a blood libel trial in Krasnystaw; another accused person, the rabbi of Wojslawice, committed suicide in prison. In 1776, the Jewish population of Krasnystaw numbered 63.

In the first half of the 19th century, a bitter struggle emerged between the Jews and the gentile townsfolk, who wished to keep their privilege of not having Jews reside in the town. In 1824, Jews were permitted to reside temporarily in several villages near the town; however, the last restrictions on Jewish residence in Krasnystaw itself were not rescinded until 1862. Eleven Jews resided in the town in 1827. By 1857, the Jewish community had grown to 151 (4% of the population); by 1897, the Jewish community grew to 1,176 (25% of the total). At that time, 80% of local trade was in Jewish hands.

In 1921, the 1,754 Jews constituted 20% of the town&#x27;s population. After the German murder of almost all the pre-World War II Polish Jews, no Jews currently reside in Krasnystaw.

== Sport ==
Krasnystaw has a 4th league football team called Start Krasnystaw. In 2008 a new stadium/recreation center was built for the team. This new stadium has over 3,000 seats. The recreation center includes an indoor basketball court, a European handball court, gym, volleyball net, and spa.

<text>Chełm (; ; ; ) is a city in southeastern Poland with 60,231 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is located to the south-east of Lublin, north of Zamość and south of Biała Podlaska, some from the border with Ukraine. Chełm used to be the capital of the Chełm Voivodeship until it became part of the Lublin Voivodeship in 1999.

The city is of mostly industrial character, though it also features numerous notable historical monuments and tourist attractions in the Old Town. Chełm is a multiple (former) bishopric. Its name comes from the Proto-Slavic word &quot;&quot;, a hill, in reference to the Wysoka Górka fortified settlement. In the third quarter of the 13th century, it was the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. Chełm was once a multicultural and religious centre populated by Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, Protestants and Jews. The Jewish population was decimated in World War II, going from 15,000 Jewish inhabitants to mere dozens. Today, 15,700 Poles claim Jewish heritage across the entirety of Poland, with the majority listing their religion as Roman Catholic on the 2021 census.

== History ==
The first traces of settlement in the area of modern Chełm date back to at the least 9th century. The following century, a fortified town () was created and initially served as a centre of pagan worship. The etymology of the name is unclear, though most scholars derive it from the Proto-Slavic noun denoting a flat hill. The town&#x27;s centre is located on a hill called &quot;góra chełmska&quot;. However, it is also theorized that the name is derived from some Celtic root. In 981 the town, then inhabited by the Slavic tribe of Buzhans, was annexed from Poland by the Kievan Rus&#x27;, along with the surrounding Cherven Towns. According to a local legend, Vladimir the Great built the first stone castle there in 1001. Following the Polish capture of Kiev in 1018, the region returned to Poland before it fell back to Kievan rule in 1031.

In 1235, Daniel of Galicia granted the town a city charter and moved the capital of his domain in 1241–1272 after destruction of Halych by the Mongols in 1240–1241. Daniel also built a new castle atop the hill in 1237, one of the few Ruthenian castles that withstood Mongol attacks, and established an Orthodox eparchy (diocese) centered at the Basilica of the Birth of the Virgin Mary. Until the 14th century, the town developed as part of Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia and then as part of the short-lived Princedom of Chełm and Belz (see Duchy of Belz). In 1366, king Casimir III the Great of Poland took control of the region after his victory in the Galicia–Volhynia Wars. On 4 January 1392, the town was relocated and granted rights under Magdeburg Law, with vast internal autonomy and the town saw an influx of Polish and other Catholic settlers.
The Latin Church Diocese of Chełm was created in 1359, but its seat was moved to Krasnystaw after 1480. Renamed as Diocese of Chełm–Lublin in 1790, it was suppressed in 1805, but since 2005 Chełm is nominally restored and listed by the Catholic Church as Latin titular bishopric.

The Eastern Orthodox bishopric entered communion with the see of Rome in the late 16th century as Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Chełm–Bełz, retaining its Byzantine Rite, but in 1867 it became part of the imperial Russian Orthodox Church, and is now the Archdiocese of Lublin and Chełm of the Polish Orthodox Church.

The town was the capital of a historical region of the Land of Chełm, administratively a part of the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. The city prospered in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was then that The Golem of Chełm by Rabbi Elijah Ba&#x27;al Shem of Chelm became famous, but the city declined in the 17th century due to the wars which ravaged Poland. In the 18th century, the situation in eastern Poland stabilized and the town started to slowly recover from the damages suffered during the Swedish Deluge and the Khmelnytsky uprising. It attracted a number of new settlers from all parts of Poland, including people of Catholic, Orthodox, and Jewish faiths. In 1794, the Chełm Voivodeship was established. Chełm was one of the first towns to join the Kościuszko&#x27;s Uprising later that year. In the Battle of Chełm of 8 June 1794, the forces of Gen. Józef Zajączek were defeated by the Russians under Valerian Zubov and Boris Lacy, the town was yet again sacked by the invading armies. The following year, as a result of the Third Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by Austria.

===Age of partitions===
During the Napoleonic Wars in 1809, in the effect of the Polish–Austrian War, the town was briefly part of the Duchy of Warsaw. However, the Congress of Vienna of 1815 awarded it to Imperial Russia. The town entered a period of decline as the local administrative and religious offices (including the bishopric) were moved to Lublin. In the mid-19th century, the Russian Army turned the town into a strong garrison, which made the Russian soldiers a significant part of the population. The period of decline ended in 1866, when the town was connected to a new railroad. In 1875, the Uniate bishopric was liquidated by the Russian authorities and all of the local Uniates were forcibly converted to the Russian Orthodox Church. In the late 19th century, the local administrative offices were restored and in 1912 a local gubernia was created. During the Russian revolution of 1905 in the city was established the Ukrainian enlightenment society of Prosvita.
During World War I, in 1915 most of the Ukrainian and Russian minority was evacuated to Sloboda Ukraine and Russia. The city fell under Austrian occupation. On 3 May 1918, Chełm was the site of a large Polish manifestation, as over 15,000 Poles gathered to celebrate the Polish 3 May Constitution Day. In September 1918, apostolic visitor Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (future Pope Pius XI) visited the city, greeted by the local Polish population. On 2 November 1918, local members of the Polish Military Organisation and students of local schools, led by Gustaw Orlicz-Dreszer, disarmed Austrian soldiers and liberated the city from Austrian rule, nine days before Poland officially regained independence. Chełm was one of the first liberated Polish cities of the former Russian Partition of Poland. The Polish 1st Cavalry Regiment was established in Chełm, which soon liberated the nearby towns of Włodawa and Hrubieszów. In the interbellum, Chełm was a county seat, administratively located in the Lublin Voivodeship (1919–1939) of the Second Polish Republic.

===World War II===

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on 27 September 1939 the invading Soviet Red Army occupied Chełm, but withdrew two weeks later in accordance with the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty. As early as 7–9 October 1939 the city was occupied by German forces and renamed &quot;Kulm&quot;. At the beginning of the war, Chełm&#x27;s population was around 33,000 of which 15,000 were Jewish. On Friday, 1 December 1939, at 8 o&#x27;clock, around 2000 Jewish men were driven at dawn to the market-square (&quot;Okrąglak&quot; or &quot;Rynek&quot;) surrounded by the German SS formations and local indigenous officials. They were forced on a death march to Hrubieszów. Hundreds were murdered on the march, others were tortured and beaten. They were marched to the Soviet border where they were forced to cross the river under gunfire. Eventually perhaps 400 of the men survived the Death March and 1600 were slaughtered.

In January 1940, the Germans murdered 440 patients of the local psychiatric hospital, including 17 children, as part of the &quot;Aktion T4&quot;. In June 1940, during the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;, the Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles, who were then imprisoned in Lublin, and then often deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, while some were murdered in the region. The local Polish mayor was murdered in a massacre of over 115 Poles committed by the Gestapo in the nearby Kumowa Valley in 1940. In late 1940, Jews were confined to a small portion of Chełm, living in very overcrowded conditions, up to several dozen a room. Jews were conscripted for forced labor near Chełm and in other locations. The German Reich established 16 forced labor camps in the new Lublin district. Locals from neighboring villages and towns of Chełm also were forced to work in these camps. (also &quot;Khelm&quot; or &quot;Kulm&quot; in German), Some of the camps were connected to the main railroad line through a railroad branch line to the killing camps.

In 1942, during Operation Reinhard, the highly secretive Bełżec, Treblinka, and the Sobibór extermination camps were built near the forced labor camps. Their purpose was to murder all Polish Jews. In May 1942, 1000 elderly Chełm Jews were sent to the Sobibór extermination camp where they were immediately murdered. In August, 3000 to 4000 more were sent, including most of the children in the ghetto. In October, the SS and their Ukrainian auxiliaries rounded up and deported another 2000 to 3000 Jews to Sobibor. In November, the remaining Jews were marched to the railway station. Most were sent to Sobibor. Those in hiding were hunted, and the SS burned several ghetto buildings and killed many people who emerged from hiding. Some Jews remained in the ghetto as laborers, but they too were murdered in January 1943. There were only an estimated 60 Jews from Chełm who survived the Holocaust. Some survivors managed to find shelter in the Chełm Chalk Tunnels. However, as many as 400 others who fled to the east at the beginning of the war returned to Chełm but quickly moved on.
Following the 1941 Operation Barbarossa the Germans established the Stalag 319 prisoner-of-war camp in Chełm, in which they imprisoned Soviet, French, British, Italian and other Allied POWs. A total of some 200,000 POWs passed through the camp, and some 90,000 died there. In May 1944, the camp was relocated to Skierniewice. The monument commemorating the victims of Stalag 319 was unveiled in Chełm in May 2009 in the presence of foreign diplomats.

From 1942 through to 1945, Chełm was one of numerous locations of the Volhynian massacres of Poles by death squads of OUN-UPA and groups of Ukrainian nationalists. The city and its environs allegedly witnessed revenge killings as well, between Ukrainians and its Polish self-defence. As noted by historians Grzegorz Motyka and Volodymyr Viatrovych, the subject is highly controversial, because in 1944, Roman Shukhevych, leader of OUN-UPA, issued an order to fabricate proofs of Polish responsibility for war crimes committed there.

=== Chełm in Jewish literature ===
By the end of World War II, only a remnant of Chełm&#x27;s Jewish population of 18,000 survived. They managed to emigrate to Israel, the United States, Canada, Latin America, or 
South Africa. Chełm became well-known as a butt of Jewish humor thanks to Jewish storytellers and writers such as Isaac Bashevis Singer, a Nobel Prize-winning novelist in the Yiddish language, who wrote &quot;The Fools of Chelm and Their History&quot; (published in English translation in 1973), and the Yiddish poet who wrote stories in verse. Notable adaptations of the Chełm Jewish folklore include the comedy &quot;Chelmer Khakhomim&quot; (&quot;The Wise Men of Chelm&quot;) by Aaron Zeitlin, &quot;The Heroes of Chelm&quot; (1942) by Shlomo Simon, published in English translation as &quot;The Wise Men of Helm&quot; (Simon, 1945) and &quot;More Wise Men of Helm&quot; (Simon, 1965), as well as the book &quot;Chelmer Khakhomim&quot; by Y. Y. Trunk. Allen Mandelbaum&#x27;s &quot;Chelmaxioms : The Maxims, Axioms, Maxioms of Chelm&quot; (David R. Godine, 1978) treats the wise men of the Jewish Chełm as scholars who are knowledgeable but lacking sense. Some Chełm stories emulate the interpretive process of Midrash and the Talmudic style of argumentation, and continue the dialogue between rabbinic texts and their manifestation in the daily arena. The seemingly tangential questioning that is typical of the Chełm Jewish Council can be interpreted as a comedic hint at the vastness of Talmudic literature. The combination of paralleled argumentation and linguistic commonality allows the Jewish textual tradition, namely Talmudic, to shine through Chełm folklore.
==Demographics==

After Poland&#x27;s independence, the Polish census of 1921 found a population of 23,221, with 12,064 Jews, 9,492 Roman Catholics (Poles), 1,369 Orthodox Christians (Ukrainian, Ruthenians and Belarusians) and 207 Lutherans (Germans).

In September 1939, at the onset of World War II, Jews constituted 60% (18,000) of the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

From 1975 to 1998 it belonged to the Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship. The town is the administrative seat of the Gmina Zator. According to data from December 31, 2008, Zator was inhabited by 4,779 people.

The city, located on the Skawa river, is well known for pisciculture, especially carp, and periodic event called Zatorskie Dni Karpia. Zator is the main city of the Carp Valley.

==History==

Originally a part of Lesser Poland, the area was acquired by the Silesian Piast Duke Władysław of Opole through a 1274 agreement with the Polish Princeps Bolesław V the Chaste. Zator then belonged to the Upper Silesian Duchy of Opole and after Władysław&#x27;s death in 1281 fell to the Duchy of Cieszyn. It received town privileges in 1292.

From 1315 onwards, Zator belonged to the Duchy of Oświęcim split off Cieszyn and in 1445 even became the capital of a Piast duchy in its own right, the Duchy of Zator under Duke Wenceslaus I, a Bohemian vassal. It finally fell back to the Kingdom of Poland, when in 1494 Wenceslaus&#x27; son Jan V sold his lands to King John I Albert.

<text>Chełmek is a town in Lesser Poland Voivodeship in southern Poland. In 1975–1998 it belonged to Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship. As of December 2021, it has 8,810 inhabitants. Previously known for the &quot;Chełmek Shoe Factory&quot;, which until 1947 was part of Bata Shoes.

Chełmek lies in the wetland area along the Przemsza river, at the foot of the Skała hill (293 meters above sea level). The town is surrounded by forests.

==History==
Chełmek was first mentioned in 1414. In 1490, it belonged to a parish from Jaworzno, and until the First Partition of Poland in 1772, it was a small village, which was administratively located in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown.

In 1772 Chełmek was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and made part of Galicia. The village was located right on the border between Prussian Silesia, and Austrian Galicia. It was regained by Poles as a result of the Austro-Polish War in 1809 and became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution in 1815, it became part of Chrzanów District of the Free City of Kraków. In November 1846, the Free City was annexed by Austria, and in 1856, rail line from Kraków to Vienna, via Chełmek was constructed. In the late 19th century, it had a population of 1,094. After World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence, and in the Second Polish Republic, Chełmek belonged to the Kraków Voivodeship, and due to proximity of the Silesian border, its residents helped Polish insurgents in Silesia (see Silesian Uprisings).

Until 1931, Chełmek remained a poor village, whose inhabitants would emigrate from it, seeking for work at local coal mines. In 1931, however, legendary Czech businessman Tomas Bata decided to acquire land in Chełmek, to build a shoe factory here, together with a settlement for workers. In five years, the population of the village doubled, a new church, kindergarten, schools and culture house were built.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in 1939, Chełmek was invaded and then occupied by Germany until 1945. In 1942, the Germans established and operated a subcamp of the Auschwitz concentration camp in the settlement. About 150 prisoners, mostly Jews deported from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, were subjected to slave labour in the subcamp. 47 prisoners died in the subcamp. The Germans left the village on 25 January 1945, and soon after the war, the school and the 1920s iron bridge over the Przemsza were rebuilt.

In 1947, the Bata Shoe Factory was nationalized, and in 1969 Chełmek received town charter.

<doc id="390481" wikidata="Q257561" url="?curid=390481" title="Wisła">
<text>Wisła (; ; ; ) is a town in Cieszyn County, Silesian Voivodeship, southern Poland, with a population of about 11,132 (2019), near the border with the Czech Republic. It is situated in the Silesian Beskids mountain range in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia and ethnic region of the Silesian Gorals. &quot;Wisła&quot; is the Polish name for the Vistula River, which has its source in the mountains near the town.

It is the only town in Poland with a majority Lutheran population (as of 2006 roughly two-thirds of the population were Protestant, which is a drop from 94,4% in 1900).

Wisła is a popular year-round tourist destination, being home to Malinka, a ski jumping hill. It is also known for being the home town of ski jumper Adam Małysz. Wisła is also the home of the Beskid Museum displaying agricultural tools, folk costumes and goatskin bagpipes from the surrounding region.

==History==
The first people to settle in Wisła in the late 16th or early 17th century came from two directions: from Ustroń up the river Vistula and Gorals searching for new pastures in the mountains (see also: Vlachs). It was first mentioned in 1615. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg monarchy. It was first recognized as a developed village of the Teschener Kammer, named &quot;na Wisłach&quot;, in 1643.

The majority of its inhabitants were Lutherans. After issuing the Patent of Toleration in 1781, they subsequently organized a local Lutheran parish as one of over ten in the region.

After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skoczów. In the second half of the 19th century it became increasingly popular as a tourist destination.

According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 4261 in 1880 to 4685 in 1910 with a majority being native Polish-speakers (98.5%-99%) and a small minority German-speaking (at most 64 or 1.5% in 1880) and at most 4 people Czech-speaking (in 1910), in terms of religion majority were Protestants (94.9% in 1910), followed by Roman Catholics (232 or 5% in 1910) and 6 Jews. The village was also traditionally inhabited by a specific subgroup of Silesian Gorals, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect.

After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland. It gained town rights in 1962.

==Tourism==
In the winter Wisła is known for its skiing: Malinka, a ski jump hill, is located here and hosts international competitions. In the summer, hiking through its many mountain trails is popular. To support its recent growth in tourism, many hotels have been built, the largest of which is Hotel Gołębiewski.

In Wisła a trail starts that leads to the Stożek Wielki, a mountain on the border with the Czech Republic that reaches a height of 978 meters.

Interesting sights in Wisła are:
* Wisła Castle – one of the official residences of the President of Poland, built in 1929–1930 by Adolf Szyszko-Bohusz
* Lutheran Church – klassicist church from 1838
* Habsburg hunting lodge – originally built on the Przysłop Pass, transferred to Wisła in 1985
* – museum of Adam Małysz

<text>Wilamowice (; earlier &quot;Willamowice&quot;; ; , ) is a rural town in southern Poland, situated in the Bielsko County, Silesian Voivodeship. The town is inhabited by a Germanic ethnic group of Vilamovians, who speak the highly endangered Wymysorys language.

==History==

According to historians, after the desolation of Polish lands by the Mongol invasion in 1241, the then Silesian Piast rulers of the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz decided to bring settlers from the West to the deserted and destroyed lands around the Silesian Foothills, to revive agriculture, industry and trade. The area was settled in the course of the German eastward colonization of Slavic lands. In this way, around 1250, a group of colonists from the area of former Flanders came to the region, specifically from Friesland, near Bruges and established the settlement Wilamowice.

The settlement was first documented in 1325, in the Peter&#x27;s Pence register as the parish Novovillamowicz (New-Wilamowice) in medieval Latin, among the Catholic parishes of Oświęcim diaconate, in the Diocese of Kraków. The place name is seen as a demarcation to the older settlement &quot;Antiquo-Willamowicz&quot; (Old-Wilamowice, today named Stara Wieś). In 1529, the two place names were recorded respectively in medieval Latin as &quot;Vilamovice Nova&quot; and &quot;Antiqua Vylamovicze&quot;.

In the course of history, the area has been part of several territorial border changes. Politically, both settlements—old and new, belonged to the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz, and the castellany gord of Oświęcim ceded from Lesser Poland around 1177 by duke Casimir II the Just to the duke of Opole—Mieszko I Tanglefoot, which in 1315 was formed in the process of the feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Oświęcim, ruled by the local dukes of the Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327, the Duchy of Oświęcim became a fiefdom of the Kingdom of Bohemia within the Holy Roman Empire.

In the 15th century, Jan Długosz lists the settlement in the diocese of Kraków benefactors register &quot;Liber beneficiorum dioecesis Cracoviensis&quot; in Old Polish language &quot;Wylamowycze&quot;, in allodial lordship of the nobleman Andreas of Wilamowic (aka Wilamowski) and the heirs Johannes and Nicolaus Wilamowski. From 1527, owners of the lordship mentioned include: the nobleman Jakob Saszowski of Gieraltowic and Wilamowic, and in 1533: the nobleman and chief judge of Oświęcim Nicolaus Saszowski of Gieraltowic (aka Gierałtowski), in 1633: Christopher Korycinski (castellan of Wojnicz), between 1707 and 1719 Władysław Morsztyn and his wife Helena née Kalinowska; to the end of the 19th century the owner Psarski sold his land and rights to residents, and from there on Wilamowice became a small rural town.

In 1457, duke Jan IV of Oświęcim agreed to sell the Duchy of Oświęcim to the Polish Crown, and in the accompanying document issued on 21 February the settlement was mentioned in Old Polish language &quot;Wylamowycze&quot;. It was not, however, until 1564, at the General sejm, that King Sigismund II Augustus issued privileges of incorporation, recognizing the Duchy of Oświęcim as part of the Polish Crown into the Silesian County of the Kraków Voivodeship.

Since the 15th century, the names used in official chronicles were the German versions &quot;Wilmeshau&quot; and &quot;Wilmesdorf&quot; for both the new and old Wilamowice respectively. The place name was subject to several vernacular changes over the course of history, and since the 18th century the name &quot;Wilmesau&quot; in High German prevailed under the ruling Habsburg monarchy; when in 1772, upon the First Partition of Poland, it became part of the Habsburg&#x27;s Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, a semi-autonomous protectorate of the Austrian Empire. After World War I and the dissolution of Austro-Hungarian monarchy, it became part of the newly independent nation of the Second Polish Republic.

In 1939, after the joint Invasion of Poland by Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Free City of Danzig, the area was annexed by Germany (see Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany) in the Occupation of Poland. After the end of the Second World War, Polish territories seized by the Red Army as it advanced westward, were restored to the post-War Polish People&#x27;s Republic.

===Archaic dialect===

Due to endogamy and geographical isolation of the settlement in a Polish language region near the German linguistic enclave around Bielsko-Biała, Wilamowice formed an independent language or dialect (see: Wymysorys language) since the Late Medieval Period, which was in use in everyday life until the end of the Second World War. At the end of the War, whilst almost all Germans in the region were expelled (see Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II), in &quot;Wilmesau&quot;—the ancestral population were able to remain. The local language, however, was banned in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic under the Soviet Occupation Forces and Soviet-backed communist regime, and the local population were partially Polonized. Although the language ban was lifted in 1956 during the &quot;Polish October&quot; revolution, attempts continued to suppress the Wymysorys dialect from public life.

Today, the Wymysorys dialect is spoken by less than 70 native speaking residents—the elderly being the majority. The status of the Wilamowice ethnolect is complex, because according to the traditional classification it is broadly understood as an East Central dialect of High German. Nevertheless, based on the self-identification of its users as a separate group from the Germans and the existence of a literary Wymysorys language (or, to be more exact, micro-language), this ethnolect can be considered a separate language.

==Notable people==
*Florian Biesik (1849–1926), writer
*Józef Bilczewski (1860–1923), archbishop of Lwów
*Józef Gara (1929–2013), former miner turned author and poet who was the creator of the modern alphabet of Wymysorys and a collector of Wymysorys songs

<text>Ustroń () is a health resort town in Cieszyn Silesia, southern Poland. Since 1999, it has been part of the Silesian Voivodeship, having previously been in Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998. It lies on the Silesian Beskids mountain range. The Równica and Czantoria mountains are nearby.

==History==

The settlement was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wrocław called &quot;Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis&quot; from around 1305 as &quot;item in Ustrona&quot;. It meant that the village was in the process of location (the size of land to pay a tithe from was not yet precise). The creation of the village was a part of a larger settlement campaign taking place in the late 13th century in the area that would later be known as Upper Silesia.

Politically, the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland, and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327, the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which, after 1526, became part of the Habsburg monarchy.

The village became a seat of a Catholic parish, mentioned in the register of Peter&#x27;s Pence payment from 1447 among the 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as &quot;Wstrowe&quot;.

In 1772, the Klemens Steel Works was opened and the village was gradually industrialised. When the steel work was closed in 1897 the market town switched to be more orientated towards a health and spa resort.

After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. Ustroń as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Bielsko and the legal district of Skoczów. In 1856, it gained market town rights. According to the 1880–1910 censuses, the population of the municipality dropped from 4,375 in 1880 to 4,275 in 1910, with a majority being native Polish-speakers (91.5–92.8%), a growing minority speaking German, and dwindling Czech-speaking population. In terms of religion, in 1910, the majority were Protestants (57.1%), followed by Roman Catholics (40.4%) and Jews (2.5%). Ustroń was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect.

After World War I, the fall of Austria-Hungary, the Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

It gained city rights in 1956. Since the 1960s, Ustroń saw a large development of new hotels and health centers. A cluster of pyramid-shaped hotels were built in the town. It was also expanded by merger of the surrounding villages: Nierodzim in 1974, Hermanice and Lipowiec in 1975.

Ustroń is the home of the Jan Jarocki Museum, which was founded in April 1986 as the Museum of Metallurgy. It is housed in an old building of the former Klemens Steel Works, which was in use between 1772 and 1897. The museum collects technical tools, as well as historical and ethnographic artifacts.
