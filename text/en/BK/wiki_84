<text>Skoczów ( , , ) is a town and the seat of Gmina Skoczów in Cieszyn County, Silesian Voivodeship, southern Poland with 14,385 inhabitants (2019). The town lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.

The name of the town is of possessive origin, derived from personal name &quot;Skocz&quot;.

==History==
The very first settlement in the nearest neighbourhood had been established by a Slavic tribe called Golensizi around the 7th century on a naturally defensive hill over the valley of the river Bładnica and ravine called &quot;Piekiełko&quot; about south-east of the town centre within borders of modern Międzyświeć. The &quot;gord&quot; was later surrounded by an earth bank and moat. The settlement was destroyed in the end of the 9th century most probably by Great Moravian Prince Svatopluk II and was not rebuilt again.

Sometimes the oldest mentioning of Skoczów is believed to be from the document allegedly issued in 1232 by Mieszko, &quot;dux Oppoliensis et dominus Tessinensis et Ratiboriensis&quot; (implicitly Mieszko II the Fat) for a knight Przecho from Zabłocie, were among witnesses is a ducal writer, Mikołaj from Coczow (Skoczów). Some researchers consider the document to be a fake. Idzi Panic takes into consideration that it could be a mistake during rewriting, and that the document could be originally issued in 1282 by Mieszko, who later ruled the Duchy of Teschen (formed in 1290, where Skoczów also belonged), but back then together with younger brother Przemko ruled Duchy of Racibórz with castellanies of Cieszyn and Oświęcim, and would more likely use the title &quot;dux Oppoliensis et dominus Tessinensis et Ratiboriensis&quot; than Mieszko II the Fat (who never used as complicated title). The rewriter could have omitted the number L in the year MCCLXXXII (1282), making it MCCXXXII (1232). If the document was indeed a fake, then the first mentioning of Skoczów as oppidum Scocoviense is from 1327 when Duke Casimir I became a vassal of the King of Bohemia. The term oppidum (used also for &quot;Jamnica&quot; preceding Frýdek) was used in contrary to &quot;civitates&quot; ruling themselves under German rights of Cieszyn, Bielsko and Frysztat. It probably meant that Skoczów was yet ruled under Polish (ducal) traditional rights.

In the document from 1327 there is also mentioned a gord, which can be linked with a subsequent wooden castle revealed in later documents. The settlement of Skoczów most probably emerged as its &quot;podgrodzie&quot;, a small locality serving it, which later evolved into a market settlement with irregular arrangement of buildings centered on main oval square a few hundred meters north of nowadays Market Square, where later (but no earlier than late 1330s) a parish church was built. The location of the town around new Market Square under German rights took place hypothetically roughly at similar time as of Frýdek, in the late 14th century. The new town had regular arrangement of buildings stretched towards the parish church in the north. It was surrounded with ramparts from wood and earth with two gates: Upper and Lower. Through the Upper Gate a path led towards Cieszyn in the east, through Lower towards Bielsko in the west. Behind the Upper Gate emerged the Upper Suburb, whereas on the right and eastern bank of Vistula River was located a Lower Suburb. In the beginning Skoczów was a small town, with around 450 citizens in the middle of the 15th century. It had been mainly an agricultural and craft trade settlement with much lower importance of trade. A local Catholic parish was first mentioned in the register of Peter&#x27;s Pence payment from 1447 among 50 parishes of Teschen deanery as &quot;Scotczowa&quot;.

In the late 1469 or early 1470 Skoczów was destroyed by fire, which burnt all chartered privileges and other documents. 26 January 1470 the Duke of Cieszyn renewed and extended all civic privileges. A school and hospital with a chapel are recorded in a document from 1482. During Reformation under Wenceslaus III Adam rule it was dominated by Lutherans, who took over the parish church, and later also hospital&#x27;s chapel. At that time Jan Sarkander was born here. In the years 1573-1577 during the rule of Wenceslaus III Adam, Duke of Cieszyn the town together with Strumień and their surrounding villages were sold to Gottard von Logau, and formed a state country. It was retrieved by Adam Wenceslaus in 1594. In 1610 Adam Wenceslaus switched his faith to Catholicism, and brought a new priest from Żywiec, Wojciech Gagatkowski. However Lutherans dominated the town for decades, the majority of Catholics was reported in 1687.

Since 1653 the town belonged to the Teschener Kammer. The 17th century was disastrous for Skoczów as well as for whole region. Because of Thirty Years&#x27; War the population was decreased by about 25-30%.

After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The town became a seat of a legal district in the political district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the town grew from 3113 in 1880 to 3744 in 1910. In 1880 the majority of its inhabitants were native Polish-speakers (69.3%) followed by German-speakers (29.5%) and Czech-speakers (1.2%). In the next years the Polish-speaking population dropped down to 48.4% in 1910, whereas German-speaking citizens grew in number up to 50.3% in 1910, Czech-speaking minority stood at relatively similar level of 1.3%. In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (65.3%), followed by Protestants (27.8%), Jews (247 or 6.6%) and 12 people were adherents to yet another religion. The town and especially its surroundings were also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. The growth of German language, then prestigious language of the state, can be partially attributed to various reasons, including cultural cringe of indigenous Slavic denizens.

After the end of World War I, both of the two newly created independent states of Poland and Czechoslovakia claimed the area of Cieszyn Silesia. On 23 January 1919 Czech units led by Colonel Josef Šnejdárek invaded the area, and clashed after its swift advance with Polish units commanded by General Franciszek Latinik near Skoczów where a battle took place on 28–30 January. It was inconclusive, and before the reinforced Czech forces could resume the attack on the town, they were pressed by Entente to stop operations and a cease-fire was signed on 3 February. On 28 July 1920 by decision of the Spa Conference Skoczów became a part of the Second Polish Republic. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland.

Kaplicówka Hill which overlooks the town is dominated by a chapel built in 1934 and a large cross. Pope John Paul II visited Skoczów in 1995, holding a mass attended by 200,000 people. The cross on Kaplicówka was erected to commemorate the visit.

From 1975 to 1998 it was located in the Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship, and since 1999 in Silesian Voivodeship.

The town holds a market on Thursdays, situated next to the Vistula river.

<text>Wadowice (; ) is a town in southern Poland, southwest of Kraków with 17,455 inhabitants (2022), situated on the Skawa river, confluence of Vistula, in the eastern part of Silesian Foothills (Pogórze Śląskie). Wadowice is known for being the birthplace of Karol Wojtyła, later Pope John Paul II and Godwin von Brumowski, Austria-Hungary’s best flying ace with 35 credited and an additional 8 possible wins in the air.

== History ==

The first permanent settlement in the area of today&#x27;s Wadowice was founded in the late 10th century or early 11th century. According to a local legend, the town was founded by a certain Wad or Wład, a short form for the Slavic name of Ladislaus (). The town was first mentioned as &quot;Wadowicze&quot; in St. Peter penny register in the years 1325–1327. In 1327 it is also mentioned (under the same name) in a fief registry sent from prince John I Scholastyk of Oświęcim to Bohemian king John I, Count of Luxemburg. At this time it was a trading settlement belonging to the Dukes of Silesia of the Piast dynasty, and according to some historians it was already a municipality. In 1430 a great fire destroyed the town. It was soon rebuilt and granted city rights, along with a city charter and a self-government, based on the then-popular Kulm law. The privileges, granted by Prince Kazimierz I of Oświęcim led to a period of fast reconstruction and growth.

The administrative division of the region in the times of regional division was complicated. Initially, between 1313/1317 and 1445, Wadowice belonged to the Silesian Duchy of Oświęcim and after 1445 to the Duchy of Zator. In 1482 Władysław I of Zator inherited only half of his father&#x27;s lands and created a separate Duchy of Wadowice, which lasted until his death in 1493. The following year his brother and successor, Jan V of Zator abdicated. At the same time the land was subject to Bohemian overlordship, which lasted until the following year, when the Duchy was bought by the Kings of Poland and incorporated as a Silesian County. Finally, the county was incorporated into the Kraków Voivodeship of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown in 1564.

In the 16th–17th centuries Wadowice was a regional centre of crafts and trade. Among the most notable sons of the town was Marcin Wadowita, a theologian, philosopher and a deacon of the Kraków Academy. He was also the founder of a hospital and a basic school in Wadowice. However, several plagues and fires halted the prosperity and the town&#x27;s growth was eventually halted as well.

=== Late modern period ===

In the effect of the First Partition of Poland, Wadowice was annexed by Austria, incorporated into the newly established Kingdom of Galicia, under direct Austrian rule, and renamed &quot;Frauenstadt&quot;. The town&#x27;s growth started soon afterwards, after a road linking Vienna with Lviv was built. The town became a seat of a communal administration and since 1867 – a county site. Small industries were developing slowly during the 19th century. New inhabitants settled in the area, attracted by the industry, new military barracks and various administrative institutions. In addition, a new hospital and a regional court were erected in the town centre. Finally, in the last 25 years of the 19th century partial liberalisation of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy led to creation of various Polish cultural and scientific societies.

After World War I and the dissolution of the monarchy, Wadowice became part of the newly reborn Poland. The seat of a powiat remained in the town and in 1919 the inhabitants of the area formed the 12th Infantry Regiment that took part in the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1920. In 1920 Karol Wojtyła was born in Wadowice (he became the bishop of Kraków, then Pope John Paul II, and was canonized after his death).

=== World War II ===

After the Polish Defensive War of 1939, Germany occupied the area and on 26 October Wadowice was annexed by Nazi Germany. On 29 December of the same year the town was renamed to &quot;Wadowitz&quot;. Initially the Polish intelligentsia was targeted by harsh German racial and cultural policies and hundreds of people from the area, most notably priests, teachers and artists, were murdered in mass executions (see &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;). Many were imprisoned in the infamous Montelupich Prison in Kraków and then murdered in the Krzesławice Fort of the Kraków Fortress in December 1939. Hundreds more were expelled and resettled to the General Government in order to make place for German settlers in accordance with the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. Germany also established and operated a Nazi prison in the town. Between 1941 and 1943 a ghetto was established in the town. Almost the entire local Jewish population (more than 2,000) was exterminated, mostly in the nearby Auschwitz concentration camp. In addition, the Germans set up a prisoner-of-war camp for Allied soldiers and a penal camp that served as a transfer camp for various German concentration camps. Despite German terror, the Home Army units were active in the area, most notably in the town itself and in the Beskid mountains to the south of it. After the German occupation, the town returned to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

=== Present ===
After the war, in 1945 Wadowice retained its powiat town status and until 1975 served as a notable centre of commerce and transport in the Kraków Voivodeship. After that the town was transferred to the newly created Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship. After the peaceful transformation of the political and economical system in Poland (in 1989), most of the local industry was found inefficient and went bankrupt. However, the ecological and historical heritage of the area as well as its status as the birthplace of Pope John Paul II led to fast growth of tourism. Currently more than 200,000 people visit Wadowice every year and this number is rising.

== Economy ==
Wadowice is today mainly a centre for tourism and sightseeing, but also a place for small industries such as the production of machines and construction materials. The town is also the headquarters of the multinational food company and biggest juice-maker of Poland, Maspex, and the shoe producer Badura.

<text>Szczyrk () is a town in the Beskid Śląski mountains of southern Poland, situated in the valley of the Żylica river. It is part of the Silesian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously being part of the Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship (1975–1998). It has a population of 5,734 people (2019).

==History==
First permanent human settlements in the area of present-day Szczyrk were reported in 16th century. According to chronicles, the village was inhabited by around 100 people in the 1730s. Initially, the majority of inhabitants were exclusively engaged in agriculture and sheep farming. Over the course of time, they began producing cloth from sheep&#x27;s wool. Timber felling was also carried out in the area.

In the 19th century, the process of timber felling expanded rapidly and numerous water mills and sawmills started to be constructed. In the early 20th century, Szczyrk slowly bagan transforming into a resort town by attracting more and more tourists. In the 1920s, the area was popular with industrialists who erected villas and mountain hostels in the town. In 1927, mountain shelters on Mount Klimczok and Sampolska Pass were built. In 1933, the popular shelter on Skrzyczne was opened.

After World War II, the town experienced a tourist boom. Thanks to its picturesque location and Silesian Beskids mountains, it became a popular and well-known resort town and a winter sports center. In 1959, a chairlift leading to Mount Skrzyczne was opened becoming one of the top tourist attractions of the town. In 1973, Szczyrk was granted city rights.

==Tourism and geography==
The town is a popular winter sports centre, with over 60 km of ski runs served by 30 ski lifts. Poland&#x27;s Winter Olympics athletes train in Szczyrk for events such as skiing and ski jumping.

The two mountain ranges that surround the valley are dominated by the peaks of Skrzyczne at and Klimczok , both of significant interest to tourists since they have commanding views from either peak. Moreover, both peaks are accessible to most people in one day&#x27;s hike via the tourist routes. Skrzyczne is also accessible via a chairlift.

To the west of Szczyrk is Wisła, a town where the source of the Vistula (Wisła) river can be found (around the Barania Góra mountain).

The town is home Mercure Szczyrk Resort, Europe&#x27;s longest hotel, which opened in 2024 and measures 330 meters (1,082 ft) in length. Situated 660 meters above sea level, the 447-room four-star hotel is also the highest altitude hotel in Poland.

<text>Strumień (, , ) is a town and the seat of Gmina Strumień, in Cieszyn County, in the Silesian Voivodeship (province) of southern Poland, on the Vistula River.

It is located in the north-eastern part of the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia and is the smallest town in the county.

==History==
The name is of topographic origin and is derived from a local stream (now non-existent) first mentioned in 1293, known as &quot;Czarny Strumień&quot; (lit. &quot;black stream&quot;, therefore &quot;Schwarzwasser&quot; in German). It is not certain if the settlement already existed then as the village was first mentioned later in 1407 as &quot;Swarczenwassir&quot;. Later the village was also mentioned as &quot;Swarczenwasser&quot; (1409), &quot;Strumienie&quot; (1450), &quot;na Strumyeny&quot; (1470), &quot;miesto Strumien&quot; (1491). Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Racibórz a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia. During the political upheaval beginning in the 1470s caused by Matthias Corvinus the land around Pszczyna with Strumień was overtaken by Casimir II, Duke of Cieszyn, who bestowed the village to his retainer, Mikołaj (Nicolaus) Brodecki, who quickly managed to procure town rights for it in 1482. Casimir II sold Pszczyna circle in 1517 but the town of Strumień stayed within the Duchy of Teschen. In 1526 the Kingdom of Bohemia became part of the Habsburg monarchy.

In 1573–1577 the town together with Skoczów and their surrounding villages were sold to Gottard von Logau, and formed state country. It was retrieved by Adam Wenceslaus in 1594.

Since 1653 it belonged to Teschener Kammer. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The town became a seat of a legal district in the political district of Bielsko. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the town dropped from 1731 in 1880 to 1579 in 1910. In 1880 the majority of its inhabitants were native Polish-speakers (83.6%) followed by German-speakers (15.4%) and Czech-speakers (16 or 1%). In the next years the Polish-speaking population dropped down to 45% in 1910, whereas German-speaking citizens grew in number up to 54.5% in 1910, Czech-speaking persons dwindled to 8 or 0.5%. In terms of religion in 1910 majority were Roman Catholics (1484 or 94%), followed by Jews (67 or 4.2%) and Protestants (28 or 1.8%). The town and especially its southern surroundings were also traditionally the northernmost area inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect. The growth of German language, then prestigious language of the state, can be partially attributed to various reasons, including cultural cringe of indigenous Slavic denizens.

After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish–Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. Following the invasion of Poland by the German army it was annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II (as Schwarzwasser again). After the war it was restored to Poland.

In 1975–1998 it was a part of the Bielsko-Biała Voivodeship and since 1999 it belongs to Silesian Voivodeship.

<text>Veterinary parasitology is a branch of veterinary medicine that deals with the study of morphology, life-cycle, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and control of eukaryotic invertebrates of the kingdom Animalia and the taxon Protozoa that depend upon other invertebrates and higher vertebrates for their propagation, nutrition, and metabolism without necessarily causing the death of their hosts. Modern parasitology focuses on responses of animal hosts to parasitic invasion. Parasites of domestic animals, (livestock and pet animals), as well as wildlife animals are considered. Data obtained from parasitological research in animals helps in veterinary practice and improves animal breeding. The major goal of veterinary parasitology is to protect animals and improve their health, but because a number of animal parasites are transmitted to humans, veterinary parasitology is also important for public health.

== Diagnostic methods ==
Various methods are used to identify parasites in animals, using feces, blood, and tissue samples from the host animal.

===Coprological===
Coprological examinations involve examining the feces of animals to identify and count parasite eggs. Some common methods include fecal flotation and sedimentation to separate eggs from fecal matter. Others include the McMaster method, which uses a special two-chamber slide that allows parasite eggs to be more clearly visible and easily counted. It is most commonly used to monitor parasites in horses and other grazing and livestock animals. The Baermann method is similar but requires more specialized equipment and more time and is typically used to diagnose lungworm and threadworm.

===Haematological===
Haematological examinations involve examining the blood of animals to determine the presence of parasites. Blood parasites tend to inhabit the erythrocytes or white blood cells and are most likely to be detected during the acute phase of infection. Veterinary parasitologists use blood smears, which involve placing a drop of blood onto a slide and spreading it over the surface in a thin film in order to examine it under a microscope. The blood is stained with a dye in order for the cells to be easily distinguished.

===Histopathological===
Histopathological examinations involve examining tissue samples from animals. A small slice of the organ suspected of being infected by parasites is mounted on a slide, stained, and examined under a microscope.

Though not technically considered a histopathological technique, skin scraping – which involves taking a small sample of the epidermal cells of a dog, cat, or other household pet – is commonly used to detect the presence of mites.

===Immunological===
Immunological examinations, such as indirect immunofluorescence, ELISA, Immunoblotting (Western blot), and Complement fixation test are methods of identifying different kinds of parasites by detecting the presence of their antigens on or within the parasite itself. These diagnostic methods are used in conjunction with coprological examinations for more specific identification of different parasite species in fecal samples.

===Molecular biological===
Molecular biological methods involve studying the DNA of the parasite in order to identify it. PCR and RFLP are used to detect and amplify parasite DNA found in the feces, blood, or tissue of the host. These techniques are very sensitive, which is useful for diagnosing parasites even when they are present in very low numbers; they are also useful for identifying parasites not only in large animal hosts but smaller insect vectors.

<text>Działdowo (; , ) is a town in northern Poland with 20,935 inhabitants as of December 2021, the capital of Działdowo County. As part of Masuria, it is situated in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (since 1999), Działdowo belonged previously to Ciechanów Voivodeship (1975–1998). The town is a major railroad junction connecting the capital city of Warsaw with Gdańsk and Olsztyn to the north.

==History==
The first settlement in the vicinity, known as &quot;Sasinowie&quot; in Polish and &quot;Sassen&quot; in German, was established by the Old Prussians, an indigenous Baltic tribe. The Teutonic Knights conquered the region and built a castle, a wing of which still remains. The new settlement near the castle founded by Mikołaj z Karbowa and named Soldov was granted town privileges on 14 August 1344 by the Grand Master Ludolf König. The name Dzialdoff was first written on a 1409 map during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War.
In 1444, the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, at the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454, and then the townspeople expelled the Teutonic Knights and recognized the Polish King as rightful ruler. During the subsequent Thirteen Years’ War, the town was briefly captured by the Teutonic Knights in 1455. After the peace treaty signed in Toruń in 1466, it became a part of Poland as a fief held by the State of the Teutonic Knights.

Within the Duchy of Prussia (a Polish fiefdom until 1657) the settlement converted to Lutheranism during the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century. The following communes belonged to the Protestant parish of Soldau: Amalienhof, Borowo, Bursch, Cämmersdorf, Gajowken, Hohendorf, Kyschienen, Königshagen, Kurkau, Niederhof, Pierlawken, Pruschinowo, and Rudolfsfelde.

===Kingdom of Prussia and Germany===
In 1701 the town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia, from 1773 on within the newly formed province of East Prussia. Within the Kingdom of Prussia and the later German Empire, the settlement developed into an important Prussian Eastern Railway junction in the second half of the 19th century.
The town had Polish majority in 1825 with 1496 Poles and 386 Germans living within it. At the same time the Prussian authorities were hostile to the local population due to its Polish pro-independence activity during the November and January Uprisings in Congress Poland. During the January Uprising of 1863 an ammunition depot and contact point was secretly established by local people trying to help their fellow Poles in the struggle against the Russian Empire; it was located at the house of Doctor Russendorf. Prussian authorities arrested several locals and harassed the local population which tried to form military units to aid the uprising. The area remained Polish despite attempts at Germanisation. In 1815 79% of the local population were Poles, and only 21% Germans. In 1837 74% were Poles and 26% Germans. In the second half of the 19th century 87% of the district&#x27;s population were Poles. With the increase of Germanisation efforts in 1910, the whole district population was divided among 57% Poles, 42% Germans and 1% Jews according to official German statistics. In 1910 the town itself had 4,728 inhabitants, 3,589 of them Germans. In 1912 the Germans introduced the terms &quot;Masurs&quot; and &quot;Masurian language&quot; instead of &quot;Pole&quot; and &quot;Polish language&quot; in the census in the area. It was part of the &quot;Landkreis Neidenburg&quot; district in East Prussia, and it was the southernmost town in the province.

The town was fought over in the early stages of World War I. It was briefly occupied by Russian troops, and won back by the Germans during the Battle of Tannenberg. The occupation of Soldau is described in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s novel &quot;August 1914&quot;.

===Interwar Poland===
Despite the attempts of the local German populace and authorities and the German Government, the town together with neighboring settlements was transferred to reborn Poland on 17 January 1920 by the Treaty of Versailles for geostrategic reasons without participating in the East Prussian plebiscite. The Prussian Eastern Railway connection to German Prussia such as Deutsch Eylau (Iława), Osterode (Ostróda), and Neidenburg (Nidzica) in East Prussia were severed after the border changes. After the town was ceded to Poland, a large number of the German inhabitants left, including not only German-speakers, but, at roughly the same percentage, Polish-speakers, despite Polish campaigns to win them over as Polish nationals.

The candidate of the German Party, Ernst Barczewski, was elected to the Sejm with 74.6% of votes in 1920, and to the Polish Senate with 34.6% of votes for the Bloc of National Minorities in 1928. In 1921, the Polish census gave the following data regarding the ethnic composition of the whole district: Poles, 15,496; Germans, 8,187; others, 44.

During the Polish-Soviet War Działdowo was briefly occupied by the Red Army which was cheered as a liberator by the local populace, and the town hoisted the German flag again but it was soon recovered by the Polish Army.

=== World War II ===

During the German Nazi - Russian Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 that began World War II, the town was invaded by Germany, and then the &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; entered to commit crimes against the Polish population. Under German occupation, the town was annexed back into the Neidenburg District by Nazi Germany. The German minority in the town formed the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; death squad that captured and tortured Polish leaders and members of the political and cultural elites before murdering them. Only some of the local Polish activists were caught by the Germans, as most fled and hid under assumed names in the General Government (German-occupied central Poland).

In 1939, the occupiers established a prisoner-of-war camp for captured Polish soldiers at the pre-war Polish military barracks. In December 1939 it was converted into a camp for Polish civilians arrested during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, which later became the Soldau concentration camp, at which 10,000–13,000 prisoners out of 30,000 were murdered. The first mass transport of Polish prisoners came to the camp from the nearby Ciechanów County in December 1939, and those were the victims of the first mass execution in the camp. The Germans also operated two forced labour camps in the town. In 1943 in Warsaw, activists from Działdowo established the secret Masurian Research Institute (&quot;Mazurski Instytut Badawczy&quot;), which was part of the Polish Secret Teaching Organization.

The town was heavily damaged during the fighting on the Eastern Front. It was assigned to Poland after the war under border changes promulgated at the 1945 Potsdam Conference, and became Działdowo.

==Transport==
The town is located at the intersection of the Voivodeship roads 542, 544, 545. There is also a train station.

<text>Płońsk (; ) is a town in central Poland with 21,591 inhabitants (2022). Situated at the Płonka river in the historic region of Mazovia, it is the seat of Płońsk County in the Masovian Voivodeship.

==History==
According to archaeological research, the Płońsk stronghold was built in the late 10th century within the early Polish state. Dating back to 1155, is the first historical record confirming the existence of Płońsk. Around the castle a group of inhabitants was formed, most of whom initially worked on the land. As a result of the fragmentation of medieval Piast-ruled Poland, it was part of the duchies of Masovia and Płock, and then it was a royal town of the Polish Crown, administratively located in the Płock Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. In 1400, Siemowit IV of Masovia, granted it town rights under Chełmno law, then merchants and craftsmen started to come to the town. Płońsk was located on a trade route connecting Toruń with Brześć.

It was a centre of the garment industry. The Jews lived mostly within the city, whilst the Poles were more scattered and tended to live in the countryside. On 16 October 1886 David Ben Gurion was born in Płońsk. Like him, also many other Jewish residents of the city immigrated to Palestine for Zionist reasons, spurred on by the idea of building a Jewish homeland.

On 14–17 August 1920, the Poles successfully defended the town during a Soviet invasion. According to the 1921 Polish census, the town had a population of 9,220, 58.1% Polish and 41.9% Jewish.

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Germany invaded the town and the &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; entered the town to commit various crimes against the populace. Under German occupation the town was annexed directly to Nazi Germany and was renamed &quot;Plöhnen&quot;. The Germans established and operated a court prison in the town. In 1940, the occupiers expelled around 1,000 Poles, whose houses and workshops were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. In September 1940, Jews from the town and the surrounding areas were imprisoned in a ghetto. Soon a typhus epidemic broke out. A hospital, a bathhouse for the sick, a pharmacy, and a folk kitchen were organized in the ghetto. In total, 12,000 Jews were prisoners of the ghetto and from October 1942, they were sent to the Auschwitz extermination camp. In 1943 in Berlin, the Germans sentenced six members of the local Polish resistance movement, some to death. On 16–18 January 1945, shortly before retreating, the German police carried out a massacre of 78 Poles in the town.

The town was administratively part of the Ciechanów Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998.

<text>Mława (; &quot;Mlave&quot;) is a town in north-eastern Poland with 30,403 inhabitants in 2020. It is the capital of Mława County. It is situated in the Masovian Voivodeship.

During the invasion of Poland in 1939, the battle of Mława was fought to the north of the city.

==History==
The first mention of Mława comes from July 2, 1426, when three princes of Mazovia - Siemowit V, Trojden II and Władysław I came here to a session of a local court. It is not known if Mława had already been an urban center, as there are no sources which would prove it. Three years later, Mława was incorporated as a town It was a royal town, located in the Płock Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. In 1521 during the Polish-Teutonic War, the town was captured and looted by the Teutonic Knights. In 1659 the town was burned by the Swedish troops, and in 1795, following the Third Partition of Poland, Mława became part of the Kingdom of Prussia.

In 1807 it was included in the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. After Napoleonic Wars, in the 1815 Congress of Vienna Mława (along with the entire province) was incorporated into the Russian Partition of Poland, as part of the initially autonomous Congress Poland. During the January Uprising, on February 20, 1864, it was the site of a clash between Polish insurgents and Russian troops. Since the town was located along the pre-1914 imperial Russian-German border, Mława was a place of heavy fighting between the two opposing armies during World War I, and was occupied by Germany.
After the war, in 1918, Poland regained independence and the town was reintegrated with Poland. During the Polish-Soviet War, it was fiercely defended by Poles on August 9–10, 1920, captured by Russians on August 10, and afterwards recaptured by Poles. Within interwar Poland, the town was assigned to the Warsaw Voivodeship (1919–39). The government of the Second Polish Republic constructed several fortifications there due to proximity of the German border.

In the opening stages of World War II, the advancing German army faced strong resistance from the Polish Army in the battle of Mława otherwise known as the Defence of the Mława between September 1 and September 3, 1939. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; entered the town on September 10, 1939, and carried out first mass arrests among local Poles, who were afterwards imprisoned in the local prison. Also on September 10, the Germans expelled 69 Jews from the town. The Germans carried out mass searches of Polish offices, courthouses and organizations, and mass arrests of local Polish intelligentsia, including local officials, teachers and priests, as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, continued in the following months, many were afterwards murdered in the Soldau concentration camp. Local disabled people were murdered in Ościsłowo, on February 20, 1940. Shortly after the beginning of the occupation of Poland, Mława was annexed to Nazi Germany on 26 October 1939 and administered as part of Regierungsbezirk Zichenau. The Germans established and operated two forced labour camps in the town.
The town (known as Mielau in German) gave its name to the &quot;Truppenübungsplatz &quot;Mielau&quot;&quot; military training range built by prisoners of the Soldau concentration camp nearby and nicknamed the New Berlin. The facility was used by the Nazis for repairing and refitting army tanks in Operation Barbarossa, and for testing anti-tank weapons and artillery on an area of . Some fifteen villages around Krzywonoś were completely dismantled to make room for it and 25,000 people were expelled in the area. Similar Nazi German military ranges in occupied Poland included the &quot;SS-Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager&quot; located in Pustków and the &quot;SS-Truppenübungsplatz Westpreußen&quot; located in Dziemiany.

Jews who had survived the ghetto were liquidated to Auschwitz. The last deportation was on December 10, 1942.

Prior to the arrival of the Soviets in 1945, Mława was the location of the German massacre of 364 prisoners of the forced labour camp adjacent to the &quot;Truppenübungsplatz &quot;Mielau&quot;&quot;. In 1945 the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Ciechanów Voivodeship.

In 1991, between 26 and 27 June, the town saw the a series of violent devastations and looting incidents when a group of youth estimated at 200 individuals, including young females, invaded the homes of the local Roma residents causing them to flee. Not a single Roma person was injured in the riot, but the material losses were substantial affecting up to 40% of residences. Many perpetrators were arrested on-site; a number of them sentenced to jail after a trial. The violence was described as motivated by racism and jealousy. The incident that triggered the riot was the killing of a Polish pedestrian struck along with his companion in a hit-and-run by a Romani male driver. The event triggered major discussions around the status of the Romani people in Poland, economic disparity, and the direction of the ongoing transitional political, social and economic reforms as the country adjusts after the end of the PRL era.

<text>Ciechanów is a city in north-central Poland, seat of the Ciechanów County in the Masovian Voivodeship. From 1975 to 1998, it was the capital of the Ciechanów Voivodeship. As of December 2021, it has a population of 43,495.

==History==
The settlement is first mentioned in a 1065 document by Bolesław II the Bold handing the land over to the church. The medieval gord in Ciechanów numbered approximately 3,000 armed men, and together with the region of Mazovia, it became part of the emerging Polish state in the late 10th century.

In 1254, Ciechanów is mentioned as the seat of a castellany (Rethiborius Castellanus de Techanow (Racibor, Kasztelan Ciechanowa)). In 1400 Janusz I of Czersk granted Ciechanów town privileges. The area eventually become a separate duchy with Casimir I of Warsaw using the title &quot;dominus et heres lub dominus et princeps Ciechanoviensis.&quot; In the Middle Ages, the defensive gord of Ciechanów protected northern Mazovia from raids of Lithuanians, Yotvingians, Old Prussians and later, the Teutonic Knights. It is not known when it was granted a town charter. This must have happened before 1475, as a document from that year, issued by Duke Janusz II of Warsaw, states that Ciechanów has a Chełmno town charter.

In the period between the 14th and 16th centuries, Ciechanów prospered with the population reaching 5,000. In the late 14th century, Siemowit III, Duke of Masovia, began construction of a castle, while his son Janusz I of Warsaw invited the Augustinians, who in the mid-15th century began construction of a church and an abbey. The Augustinian Friars were brought to Ciechanów in 1358 by Duke Siemowit III. They experienced the most turbulent times during the Reformation. From the 17th century, the Augustinians’ pastoral presence was growing in the towns. The monastery – characterised by mild observance – was usually inhabited by four to seven monks.

In 1526, together with all Mazovia, Ciechanów was incorporated directly to the Kingdom of Poland. It was a royal city of Poland, the seat of the Land of Ciechanów, a separate administrative unit within the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province.

The town was handed over to Bona Sforza, as her dowry. Ciechanów prospered until the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660), when the town was burned and ransacked.
After the second partition of Poland (1793), Ciechanów briefly became seat of a newly created voivodeship. In 1795, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, and reduced to the status of a provincial town in Przasnysz county. In 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars, Ciechanów was ransacked and destroyed. In 1807 it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. Since 1815, the town belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Its residents actively supported Polish rebellions. As part of anti-Polish repressions, the Augustinian monastery was dissolved in 1864. In the late 19th century, Ciechanów emerged as a local trade and industry center. In 1864, a brewery was opened, in 1867 it became seat of a county, in 1877 a rail station of the Vistula River Railroad was completed, and in 1882 a sugar refinery was opened. The period of prosperity was short, as during World War I, Ciechanów was almost completely destroyed. Following World War I, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the town.

During the Polish–Soviet War, in 1920, the town was briefly occupied by the Soviet Russians, who resorted to rape and looting of stores, houses and schools. The one remaining Catholic priest was harassed by the occupiers, however, thanks to the intercession of the local population, he avoided deportation or death. 150 Polish soldiers were hid from the Russians by the local Jews in the synagogue. Some local socialists and intelligentsia joined the occupation structures for diversionary purposes, and when the Polish army reached the city again on August 15, 1920, they immediately disarmed several hundred Soviets.

In the Second Polish Republic, Ciechanów remained seat of a county in Warsaw Voivodeship. In 1938, its population was 15,000, and the town was a military garrison, home to the 11th Uhlan Regiment of Marshall Edward Smigly-Rydz.

===World War II===
Ciechanów was captured by the Wehrmacht on the night of September 3/4, 1939. The town was annexed by Nazi Germany and was known as &quot;Zichenau&quot; in German. It was the capital of Regierungsbezirk Zichenau, a new subdivision of the Province of East Prussia. The vast majority of the Polish and Jewish population was seen as racially inferior and Germany planned its eventual annihilation. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; entered the city on September 10, 1939, and carried out first mass arrests among local Polish intelligentsia. Residents were imprisoned in Gestapo jails established in municipal buildings and the Town Hall. The Germans carried out mass searches of Polish and Jewish homes, offices and organizations, as well as synagogues, which were desecrated and looted. Several hundred Poles were transported from the jail in Ciechanów and murdered in large massacres in the nearby village of Ościsłowo as part of &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. Local disabled people were also murdered in Ościsłowo on February 20, 1940. Local teachers were arrested in October and November 1939, and deported to the Soldau concentration camp, where they were murdered in December 1939, and some were also murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp.

Poles were also subjected to expulsions. Around 600 people were expelled in December 1939, further expulsions were carried out in subsequent years. In Ciechanów, the Germans also organized a transit camp for Poles deported for forced labor to the areas of Klaipėda, Tilsit (Sovetsk) and Königsberg (Kaliningrad), and a forced labor &quot;education&quot; camp.

Before World War II, Ciechanów was home to a large Jewish community of 1,800, but during the Nazi German occupation, in November 1942, the majority of the Jewish community were transported to the Red Forest (&quot;Czerwony Bór&quot;) northeast of town and murdered in a mass shooting. During the war many Polish Jews and resistance fighters were executed by the Germans in the castle.

On January 17, 1945, Ciechanów was captured from Nazi Germany by the Red Army, and was restored to Poland after the war.

<doc id="390498" wikidata="Q5034940" url="?curid=390498" title="Cape May–Lewes Ferry">
<text>The Cape May–Lewes Ferry is a ferry system in the United States that traverses a crossing of the Delaware Bay connecting North Cape May, New Jersey with Lewes, Delaware. The ferry constitutes a portion of U.S. Route 9 and is the final crossing of the Delaware River-Delaware Bay waterway before it meets the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of only two direct crossings between Delaware and New Jersey, the other being the Delaware Memorial Bridge.

==System==

The Cape May–Lewes Ferry, operated by the Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA), consists of three ferry vessels and two terminal facilities. Its operations are based at its Cape May terminal, which is actually located in North Cape May, on the north shore of the Cape May Canal.
The three vessels in the fleet carry both vehicles (passenger cars, buses, RVs, tractor trailers, motorcycles, and bicycles) and foot passengers. Each has a capacity of 100 vehicles and 800 passengers, selling out in advance during the popular summer weekends (although passenger capacity usually does not). Advance reservations are accepted.

The ferry trip takes approximately 85 minutes. The company&#x27;s site says that the roundtrip is approximately three hours. The ferry provides a view of three lighthouses: the Cape May Light in New Jersey, and the Harbor of Refuge Light and Delaware Breakwater East End Light near Lewes.
The ferry has two terminal facilities. Both with toll booths, vehicle staging areas, parking lots, and a terminal building with ticket counters for walk on passengers, restroooms and dining facilities. The Cape May Terminal also hosts the maintenance facility for the three vessels, along with lay berths. The terminals were substantially expanded during the mid 1980&#x27;s with new terminal buildings built in Lewes in 1984 and Cape May in 1988 along with new toll booths, passenger loading buildings. The terminal building in Lewes was renovated and expanded in 1999 and a new Cape May terminal building replaced the existing structure, in 2001. Both terminals now feature unique, recognizable &quot;towers,&quot; which contain elevators and staircases connecting the terminal buildings to glass-enclosed walkways. The walkways allow foot passengers to board the vessel directly on the second deck from the terminal building, avoiding vehicles driving onto the car deck below.

As the ferry is a part of US 9, it is included as part of the U.S. Highway System. The only other U.S. Route to use a ferry is U.S. Route 10, which uses the across Lake Michigan. Routewise, taking the ferry avoids going around the Delaware Bay and avoids highways and bridges such as the New Jersey Turnpike, Delaware Memorial Bridge, US 13, and DE 1.

==Fleet==
===Current fleet===
The current vessels are part of the second generation Cape May Lewes Fleet, with the MV Delaware, MV New Jersey and MV Twin Capes replacing the original ferry fleet that was purchased from the Chesapeake Bay and was in operation for the ferry&#x27;s first 10 years in the mid 1970&#x27;s. The MV Cape Henlopen and MV Cape May supplemented the first three vessels during the 1980&#x27;s. The MV Twin Capes was decommissioned in 2014 and the MV Cape May decommissioned in 2010 leaving the MV Delaware, MV New Jersey and MV Cape Henlopen in operation. 

Each vessel consists of an open car deck situated atop a hull that is low to the water. Because of the ships&#x27; shallow displacements, the ships appear almost barge-like, sitting directly atop the water, from a distance. The ships were built with two decks atop the car deck with the second deck consisting of a gift shop, snack bar, and interior and exterior seating areas, and the third deck consisting of outdoor seating areas, an interior crew room. The pilot house is on the fourth deck. Subsequent renovations changed these plans on the vessels third decks with an exterior bar and an additional passenger lounge up forward on the MV Delaware.

Each vessel can hold 100 cars and 800 passengers. All have a length of and a breadth of , a displacement of at least 2,100 tons, a maximum draft of , two diesel engines, and a top speed of (18 mph).

====MV &quot;Delaware&quot;====

The MV &quot;Delaware&quot; was the first of the original three vessels of the new 1970s fleet. Christened in June 1974, she is the flagship of the fleet. The &quot;Delaware&quot; has undergone several renovations and refurbishments. The first in 1994 added an additional passenger lounge on the third deck which included a deli and an outdoor bar with refurbishments to her main passenger lounge on the second deck. New &quot;shark fin&quot; smokestacks were added in 1997 replacing her original stacks. A renovation in 2001 resulted in her second and third decks being extended forward and aft and the outdoor bar moved behind the stacks along with renovations to both interior spaces. A third renovation in 2013 reconfigured the interior space on the second deck.

====MV &quot;New Jersey&quot;====

The MV &quot;New Jersey&quot; is the second of the original three vessels of the new 1970s fleet, christened in November 1974. An outdoor canopy was added to the third deck in 1996 and in 1999 she received upgraded finishes and seating to the interior passenger lounge. Her main passenger lounge was upgraded in 2013 with new carpeting and seating. In 2020-2021 the MV New Jersey received a $20 million dollar renovation, refurbishment and upgrade when her exterior was sandblasted down to bare metal, her passenger lounge was gutted and stripped down to the studs, her pilothouse stripped down, original stacks removed and her original powerplant was taken out. It was replaced with new propulsion systems, new stacks, new windows and doors to the passenger lounge, a new console in the pilot house and a fresh coat of paint giving the MV New Jersey many more years of reliable, safe, and comfortable service.

====MV &quot;Cape Henlopen&quot;====

The MV &quot;Cape Henlopen&quot;, the fourth vessel of the fleet built in 1981 was christened &quot;New Del&quot; in July 1981. The vessel was renamed &quot;Cape Henlopen&quot; in 1984. She received new outdoor seating and a canopy along with new indoor seating in 1998. A more recent refurbishment in 2012 resulted in new interior lighting, flooring, seating and climate control. The ferry plans to retire the MV &quot;Cape Henlopen&quot; by the year 2027. 

===Former fleet===
The original fleet of four steamships and two diesel-powered ships was purchased in 1964 from the defunct Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry in Virginia, replaced by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel. Those ships were the SS &quot;Cape May&quot; (originally the SS &quot;Delmarva&quot; 1934), the SS &quot;Delaware&quot; (originally the SS Pocahontas 1941), the SS &quot;New Jersey&quot; (originally the SS &quot;Princess Anne&quot; 1936), the MV &quot;Cape Henlopen&quot; (originally named USS &quot;Buncombe County&quot; (LST-510) in 1944 and renamed the MV &quot;Virginia Beach&quot; in 1955) and later in 1964, the MV &quot;Atlantic&quot; (originally the MV &quot;Old Point Comfort&quot; converted from USS LST-970) (this vessel was sold at the end of 1966).

The four remaining ships were replaced beginning in 1974 with five new, diesel-powered vessels, of which two have themselves been retired.

====MV &quot;Twin Capes&quot;====

The MV &quot;Twin Capes&quot; was one of the original three vessels of the 1970s fleet, christened in May 1975. She was extensively renovated in a $27 million project between 1994 and 1996 resulting in the original superstructure on and above the second deck removed, the second deck extended forward and aft, and a new superstructure with four new decks, multiple lounges, new pilot house and &quot;shark fin&quot; smokestacks added. The vessel was then marked as a miniature cruise ship, complete with two sets of elevators, a sweeping interior staircase, interior areas on four different decks, an enlarged retail shop, a food court with a brick pizza oven, four different bars, and a buffet restaurant in a two-deck-tall, glass-enclosed atrium. Although the restaurant was shut down in 2000 after U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors found numerous violations in the galleys of all five vessels, the ship remained an attraction. Her sister ship is the MV &quot;Delaware&quot;. In July 2010, due to decreasing ridership, the DRBA announced that the vessel was for sale. The &quot;Twin Capes&quot; was taken out of service and retired in October 2013. On July 20, 2017, the &quot;Twin Capes&quot; was towed out of the Cape May Terminal to be stripped before a planned sinking as an artificial reef in 2018 in a project led by Captain Tim Mullane. The &quot;Twin Capes&quot; was scuttled on June 15, 2018, in the North Atlantic Ocean off Bethany Beach, Delaware, at to form part of the Del-Jersey-Land Inshore Artificial Reef.

====MV &quot;Cape May&quot;====

The MV &quot;Cape May&quot;, which was the newest vessel of the fleet christened in May 1985, was refurbished in 1998 in a $20 million project that retained the original superstructure and added deck extensions and a new fourth deck. The renovation added a fourth-deck buffet restaurant, bars, an enlarged gift shop, an elevator, and additional interior seating. In 2007, in order to help close an operating deficit, the DRBA removed the &quot;Cape May&quot; from service and announced that the vessel was up for sale. The vessel&#x27;s added expense of operation and low use—it had made only fifteen crossings in 2007—were additional factors leading to its removal from service. The owners of Cross Sound Ferry in Connecticut had shown interest in purchasing the ferry. In 2013, the &quot;Cape May&quot; was sold to Northstar Marine Services for $750,000, to be converted to a support vessel for offshore wind farms.

==History==
In 1926, a ferry between Cape May and Lewes was planned. The idea was to use a World War I military ship to transport passengers and cars across the Delaware Bay. The project was abandoned after a few months.

After several months of preparations, the Delaware River and Bay Authority conducted a trial run using the ferry Pocahantas borrowed from Virginia&#x27;s Chesapeake Bay Ferry Commission on October 17, 1962.

Service officially began on July 1, 1964, utilizing a fleet of five ships purchased from Virginia. Those ships had previously provided service across the Chesapeake Bay, connecting Cape Charles with Virginia Beach, but the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel in 1964 rendered that service obsolete. The first trip went from Cape May to Lewes.

All of the steamers were replaced in the 1970s with the service&#x27;s current fleet.

When it began service, the Cape May–Lewes Ferry operated under a 24-hour schedule. That schedule was cut back in 1975 to 16 hours per day.

Nolan C. Chandler, a former oiler for Virginia&#x27;s Norfolk–Kiptopeke Ferry, was the first manager of the Cape May–Lewes Ferry. Chandler started on March 15, 1964.

The Cape May–Lewes Ferry welcomed its first female permanent captain, Sharon Urban, in August 2020.

==Tourism==
The ferry was constructed with transportation as its primary use, providing a connection between the south Jersey Shore towns and the Delaware Beaches and Ocean City, Maryland, on the Delmarva Peninsula. Prior to its inception, travelers between these areas needed to drive across southern New Jersey to the Delaware Memorial Bridge, and then down through Delaware on U.S. Route 13, or vice versa if they were coming from Delaware. The Delaware River and Bay Authority (DRBA) later recognized the ferry&#x27;s potential as a tourist attraction. While it continues to provide transportation between Delaware and New Jersey, the experience has also been optimized to draw in tourists.

The ferry fleet was substantially overhauled during the 1990s, adding several amenities—including buffet restaurants, bars, and lounges—intended to promote the ride as a draw in itself. The DRBA operates a shuttle bus service on both sides of the bay in the summer months, giving foot passengers both a ride on the ferry and round-trip transportation from the terminals into Cape May and Lewes for one combined rate. In New Jersey, the shuttle connects the ferry to the Cape May Welcome Center in downtown Cape May. In Delaware, the shuttle operates from the ferry to the Tanger Outlets and a park and ride lot in Rehoboth Beach. DART First State operates the Route 204 bus which connects the ferry terminal with downtown Lewes and the Lewes Transit Center park and ride, where transfers can be made to DART First State&#x27;s Beach Bus routes that serve the Delaware Beaches and provide connections to Ocean City Transportation&#x27;s Coastal Highway Beach Bus in Ocean City, Maryland. The DRBA also operates a shuttle bus that links the ferry to the Cape May County Park &amp; Zoo on select days from late June through August and to the Tree to Tree Aerial adventure park at the zoo from late May to late September. The Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts operates trolley tours of Cape May, the Cape May Lighthouse, and the Emlen Physick Estate from the ferry terminal from late June to the end of August. A private operator also runs a coach bus that connects the ferry in Cape May to the Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic City; the package includes round-trip ferry service, round-trip coach service, and free play for slots. The DRBA has partnered with local merchants to give discounts to passengers, allowing passengers to purchase a round-trip ticket and not disembark midway.

In addition to these promotions, the ferry also offers special holiday excursions, including the annual fireworks cruise on the Fourth of July. The cruise features entertainment on the car deck and a catered meal.

==Incidents and accidents==
On the evening of December 10, 2009, the &quot;New Jersey&quot; ran aground on a sandbar near the mouth of the Cape May Canal during an unusually low tide. The ferry was freed by a rising tide and did not suffer any structural damage.

On March 30, 2019, after going from Cape May, New Jersey, the ferry lost power with 143 passengers on board. After two hours being stuck in the bay, the ferry was towed back to Cape May.

On November 17, 2020, after leaving Cape May in high winds, the &quot;Cape Henlopen&quot; ran aground off the coast of Cape May, New Jersey. The passengers were not harmed and the vessel was towed back to Cape May shortly after.

<text>The Whole Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre, commonly called the Bay Psalm Book, is a metrical psalter first printed in 1640 in Cambridge, Colony of Massachusetts Bay. It was the first book printed in British North America. The psalms in it are metrical translations into English. The translations are not particularly polished, and none have remained in use, although some of the tunes to which they were sung have survived (for instance, &quot;Old 100th&quot;); however, its production, just 20 years after the Pilgrims&#x27; arrival at Plymouth, Massachusetts, represents a considerable achievement. It went through several editions and remained in use for well over a century. 

In November 2013, one of eleven known surviving copies of the first edition sold at auction for $14.2 million, a record for a printed book.

==History==

=== 17th century ===
The early residents of the Massachusetts Bay Colony brought with them several books of psalms: the &quot;Ainsworth Psalter&quot; (1612), compiled by Henry Ainsworth for use by Puritan &quot;separatists&quot; in Holland; the &quot;Ravenscroft Psalter&quot; (1621); and the &quot;Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter&quot; (1562), of which there were several editions. Evidently they were dissatisfied with the translations from Hebrew in these several psalters and wished for some that were closer to the original. They hired &quot;thirty pious and learned Ministers&quot;, including Richard Mather, Thomas Mayhew, and John Eliot, to undertake a new translation, which they presented here. The tunes to be sung to the new translations were the familiar ones from their existing psalters.

The first printing was the third product of the printing press in Cambridge, the first and only press in the colonies, which was owned by Elizabeth Glover and managed by Stephen Daye. The book consisted of a 148 small quarto leaves, including a 12-page preface, &quot;The Psalmes in Metre&quot;, &quot;An Admonition to the Reader&quot;, and an extensive list of &quot;errata&quot; headed &quot;Faults escaped in printing&quot;. Subsequent editions were explicitly printed for sale in Boston by the first bookseller in British America, Hezekiah Usher, and it is hypothesized that Usher may have also intended to sell this first edition from his shop in Cambridge. An estimated 1,700 copies of the first edition were printed.

The third edition (1651) was extensively revised by Henry Dunster and Richard Lyon. The revision was entitled &quot;The Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs of the Old and New Testament, faithfully translated into English metre&quot;. This revision was the basis for all subsequent editions, and was popularly known as the &quot;New England Psalter&quot; or &quot;New England Version&quot;. The ninth edition (1698), the first to contain notated music (rather than simply identifying tunes by name), included 13 tunes from John Playford&#x27;s &quot;A Breefe Introduction to the Skill of Musick&quot; (London, 1654).

=== 18th century ===
The expansion of the neoclassical movement in England led to an evolution in the singing of psalms. These changes found their way to America and subsequently new psalm versions were written. In the early part of the 18th century, several updated psalms, notably those written by Tate and Brady and by Isaac Watts, were published. Shortly thereafter several congregations in New England elected to replace the &quot;Bay Psalm Book&quot; with these new titles.

In 1718, Cotton Mather undertook the revision of the original &quot;Bay Psalm Book&quot; which he had studied since youth. Two subsequent revisions were published in 1752, by John Barnard of Marblehead and in 1758 by Thomas Prince. Prince was a clergyman at the Old South Church in Boston. He convinced the members of the congregation of the need to produce a revised, more scholarly, edition of the &quot;Bay Psalm Book&quot;. However, Prince&#x27;s version was not accepted outside of his membership and in 1789, the Old South Church reverted to the earlier edition published by Isaac Watts.

==Title page==
The title page of the first edition of 1640 reads:
==An example of the text==
&quot;Psalm 23&quot; provides an example of the translation, style and versification of the text of the &quot;Bay Psalm Book&quot;:

==Extant copies and auction records==

Eleven copies of the first edition of the &quot;Bay Psalm Book&quot; are still known to exist, of which only five copies are complete. Only one of the eleven copies is currently held outside the United States. One copy is owned by each of the following:

A 1648 edition, described in &quot;American Book Prices Current&quot; as the &quot;Emerson Copy&quot;, fetched $15,000 on May 3, 1983, at New England Book Auctions in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. On September 17, 2009, Swann Galleries auctioned an early edition, c. 1669–1682, bound with an Edinburgh Bible, for $57,600.

<text>A psalter is a volume containing the Book of Psalms, often with other devotional material bound in as well, such as a liturgical calendar and litany of the Saints. Until the emergence of the book of hours in the Late Middle Ages, psalters were the books most widely owned by wealthy lay persons. They were commonly used for learning to read. Many psalters were richly illuminated, and they include some of the most spectacular surviving examples of medieval book art.

The English term (Old English , ) derives from Church Latin. The source term is , which is simply the name of the Book of Psalms (in secular Latin, it is the term for a stringed instrument, from &quot;psalterion&quot;).
The Book of Psalms contains the bulk of the Divine Office of the Roman Catholic Church. 
The other books associated with it were the Lectionary, the Antiphonary, and Responsoriale, and the Hymnary.
In Late Modern English, &quot;psalter&quot; has mostly ceased to refer to the Book of Psalms (as the text of a book of the Bible) and mostly refers to the dedicated physical volumes containing this text.

==Western Christianity==

Dedicated psalters, as distinct from copies of the Psalms in other formats, e.g. as part of a full edition of the Old Testament, were first developed in the Latin West in the 6th century in Ireland and from about 700 on the continent.

The extensively illustrated Utrecht Psalter is one of the most important surviving Carolingian manuscripts and exercised a major influence on the later development of Anglo-Saxon art. In the Middle Ages psalters were among the most popular types of illuminated manuscripts, rivaled only by the Gospel Books, from which they gradually took over as the type of manuscript chosen for lavish illumination. From the late 11th century onwards they became particularly widespread - Psalms were recited by the clergy at various points in the liturgy, so psalters were a key part of the liturgical equipment in major churches.

Various different schemes existed for the arrangement of the Psalms into groups (see Latin Psalters). As well as the 150 Psalms, medieval psalters often included a calendar, a litany of saints, canticles from the Old and New Testaments, and other devotional texts. The selection of saints mentioned in the calendar and litany varied greatly and can often give clues as to the original ownership of the manuscript, since monasteries and private patrons alike would choose those saints that had particular significance for them.

Many psalters were lavishly illuminated with full-page miniatures as well as decorated initials. Of the initials the most important is normally the so-called &quot;Beatus initial&quot;, based on the &quot;B&quot; of the words &quot;Beatus vir...&quot; (&quot;Blessed is the man...&quot;) at the start of Psalm 1. This was usually given the most elaborate decoration in an illuminated psalter, often taking a whole page for the initial letter or first two words. Historiated initials or full-page illuminations were used to mark the beginnings of the major divisions of the Psalms, or the various daily readings, and may have helped users navigate to the relevant part of the text, as medieval books almost never had page numbers. 

Many psalters, particularly from the 12th century onwards, included a richly decorated &quot;prefatory cycle&quot; &amp;ndash. A series of full-page illuminations preceding the Psalms, usually illustrating the Passion story, though some also featured Old Testament narratives. Such images helped to enhance the book&#x27;s status, and served as aids to contemplation in the practice of personal devotions.

The psalter is also a part of either the Horologion or the breviary, used to say the Liturgy of the Hours in the Eastern and Western Christian worlds respectively.

==Eastern Christianity==
Non-illuminated psalters written in Coptic include some of the earliest surviving codices (bound books) altogether. The earliest Coptic psalter predates the earliest Western (Irish) one by more than a century.
The Mudil Psalter, the oldest complete Coptic psalter, dates to the 5th century. It was found in the Al-Mudil Coptic cemetery in a small town near Beni Suef, Egypt. The codex was in the grave of a young girl, open, with her head resting on it. Scholar John Gee has argued that this represents a cultural continuation of the ancient Egyptian tradition of placing the Book of the Dead in tombs and sarcophagi.

The Pahlavi Psalter is a fragment of a Middle Persian translation of a Syriac version of the Book of Psalms, dated to the 6th or 7th century.

In Orthodox Christianity, the Book of Psalms for liturgical purposes is divided into 20 &quot;kathismata&quot; or &quot;sittings&quot;, for reading at Vespers and Matins. &quot;Kathisma&quot; means sitting, since the people normally sit during the reading of the psalms. Each kathisma is divided into three stases, from &quot;stasis&quot;, to stand, because each stasis ends with Glory to the Father..., at which everyone stands. 

The reading of the kathismata are arranged so that the entire psalter is read through in the course of a week. During Great Lent it is read through twice in a week. 
During Bright Week (Easter Week) there is no reading from the Psalms. Orthodox psalters usually contain the Biblical canticles, which are read at the canon of Matins during Great Lent.

The established Orthodox tradition of Christian burial has included reading the Psalms in the church throughout the vigil, where the deceased remains the night before the funeral, a reflection of the vigil of Holy Friday. Some Orthodox psalters also contain special prayers for the departed for this purpose. While the full tradition is showing signs of diminishing in practice, the psalter is still sometimes used during a wake.

<text>St. Mary&#x27;s City (also known as Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City) is a former colonial town that was founded in March 1634, as Maryland&#x27;s first European settlement and capital. It is now a state-run historic area, which includes a reconstruction of the original colonial settlement and a designated living history venue and museum complex. Half the area is occupied by the campus of St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland. The entire area contains a community of about 933 permanent residents and some 1,400 students living in campus dorms and apartments.

The city is an unincorporated community under Maryland state law and is located in southern St. Mary&#x27;s County, which occupies the southernmost tip of the state on the western shore of Chesapeake Bay. The community is bordered by the St. Mary&#x27;s River, a short, brackish-water tidal tributary of the Potomac River, near where it empties into the Chesapeake.

St. Mary&#x27;s City is the historic site of the founding of the Colony of Marylandthen called the Province of Marylandwhere it served as the colonial capital from 1634 until 1695. The original settlement is the fourth oldest permanent English settlement in the United States.

Notably, St. Mary&#x27;s City is the earliest site of religious freedom being established in the United States, as it is the first North American colonial settlement established with a specific mandate of providing haven for people of both Catholic and Protestant Christian faiths.

It is also an internationally recognized archaeological research area and training center for archaeologists, and is home to the Historical Archaeology Field School. There have been over 200 archeological digs in St. Mary&#x27;s City over the last 30 years. Archaeological research continues in the city.

==Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City: Reconstructed colonial town and living history==
Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City is a large public access historic interpretation area with four public museums and is a re-creation of the original colonial capital of Maryland and also the original settlers village.

It has several living history museums, and the entire complex is staffed by period dressed actors who recreate history theatrically, as well as archeologists and archeology students who provide scientific and historical interpretation, public archeological site displays, reconstructed colonial buildings, including ongoing year-round outdoor historical reenactments, a working colonial farm and the fully working replica of &quot;&quot;The Dove&quot; sailing ship&quot;, which was one of the &quot;two original settlers ships that established the first Maryland colony&quot; (Maryland&#x27;s historical equivalent of the Mayflower).

Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City also provides presentations on different aspects of colonial era woodland Indian life. At special times of the year, members of the Piscataway Indian Nation also provide reenactments and other cultural demonstrations. The Piscataway people were the original inhabitants of St. Mary&#x27;s City and also befriended and helped the early colonists.

The area also hosts summer stock theater productions (with historical themes) and other special events. Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City is owned by the State of Maryland and runs under a registered nonprofit charter. In addition to general tourism, the organization hosts special tours for school children, handling more than 20,000 students on field trips per year.

Historic St. Mary&#x27;s is under the administration of the &quot;Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City Commission&quot;, a government agency of the State of Maryland.

==St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland==
The public honors college, St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, is a state-funded coed undergraduate liberal arts college. It is only one of two &quot;Public Honors Colleges&quot; in the nation and one of only a handful of small public liberal arts colleges. It was specifically tasked by the state of Maryland to be modeled after far more expensive private elite liberal arts colleges with the intention of offering such an education in the public sector.

The school is secular (nonreligious); the name commemorates the original colonial settlement by that name, half of which was located where the college now stands.

In 2014, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, in its annual &quot;Best Colleges and Universities&quot; report, ranked St. Mary&#x27;s College as &quot;5th&quot; in the nation under the category &quot;Top Public Schools&quot; in the &quot;Colleges&quot; ranking.

==History of St. Mary&#x27;s City==

===Beginnings===

====George Calvert====

Colonial St. Mary&#x27;s City was first envisioned by an English Lord, George Calvert. Calvert had been born in Yorkshire to a Catholic family, but when he was twelve, the local authorities compelled his parents to send George and his brother Christopher to a Protestant tutor. From then on George conformed to the established religion and had a successful career in service to the crown. His first attempt at establishing a colony was in 1621 in the Province of Avalon on land he purchased in Newfoundland, but after a few years, Calvert decided a warmer climate would be a better location.

After his wife&#x27;s death in 1622, and a shift in his political fortunes, in 1625 Calvert resigned his position as a secretary of state and returned to the religion of his childhood, at a time of continued religious persecution of the Roman Catholics in England. In 1631, Calvert obtained a grant from King Charles I in recognition of his services to king and country. It had been a dream of George Calvert to establish a colony in North America and to also make it a haven for persecuted Catholics.

====Cecil Calvert====
George Calvert died shortly before the Maryland charter received the royal seal; however, the King continued the grant to his eldest son and heir, Cecil. Cecil Calvert continued and expanded his father&#x27;s plans. While their interest in providing a haven for fellow Catholics was genuine, it was imperative that the enterprise be profitable. Supporters in England of the Virginia colony opposed the Charter, as they had little interest in having a competing colony to the north. Rather than going to the colony himself, Baltimore stayed behind in England to deal with the political threat and sent his next younger brother Leonard in his stead. He never travelled to Maryland.

Leonard spent the rest of his life there, leading the settlers through many trials and tribulations, as well as to great successes in the farming and selling of tobacco back to Britain. Leonard, more than anyone else in his family, became the actual founder of colonial Maryland.

====The &quot;Ark&quot; and the &quot;Dove&quot;====
Led by Leonard Calvert, in November 1633, two ships, &quot;The Ark&quot; and &quot;The Dove&quot;, set sail from the Isle of Wight, loaded with settlers, Jesuit missionaries and indentured servants. After a long, rough sea voyage with a stopover to resupply in Barbados, they arrived in what is now Maryland in March 1634. They made their first permanent settlement in what is now St. Mary&#x27;s County, Maryland choosing to settle on a bluff overlooking the St. Mary&#x27;s River, a relatively calm, tidal tributary near the mouth of the Potomac River where it empties into the Chesapeake Bay.


The site had been occupied by members of the Yaocomico branch of the Piscataway Indian Nation, who had abandoned it as being vulnerable to attack by the Susquehanna. The settlers had with them a former Virginia colonist who was fluent in their language and they met quickly with the chief of the region. The Tayac Kittamaquund, paramount chief of the Piscataway Indian Nation, sold thirty miles of land there to the English newcomers. He wanted to develop them as allies and trading partners (especially because of their advanced technology, such as farming implements, metal-working, gunpowder and weapons, types of food and liquor, etc.). For some time, the Piscataway, their tributary tribes, and the English Marylanders coexisted peacefully.

====Naming of St. Mary&#x27;s City====

St. Mary&#x27;s City was officially named and founded on the site of the new settlement on March 27, 1634. &quot;The name derived from the king&#x27;s suggestion that the colony be named &quot;Marianus&quot; in honor of the queen, Henrietta Maria...They settled on &quot;Terra Mariae&quot;. The original group of settlers numbered 300, mostly English and also some Irish. There may also have been at least one mixed race (African and European heritage) indentured servant who had been picked up on the way over in Barbados. There were also other indentured servants from England and Ireland.

The group was a mix of Catholics and Protestants during a time of religious persecution of Catholics in the British Isles. Leonard Calvert (1606–1647), himself a Roman Catholic, became the governor of the new colony and continued to lead the settlers. St. Mary&#x27;s City became the capital of the new Maryland colony, and remained so for sixty one years until 1694.

====1634–1635: First Maryland legislative assembly====

The first Maryland assembly, the first session of a non-native legislative body in Maryland, convened in 1634 and met periodically through 1635. The assembly quickly began to challenge a number of Cecil Calvert&#x27;s edicts (sent in a letter along with the settlers), although they did not challenge his proprietorship over the new colony or his requirement for religious tolerance. Nevertheless, they pushed successfully for more personal freedoms and to adapt Calvert&#x27;s edicts to the realities on the ground in the colony, which were not always the same as his expectations. For example, he wanted them to live in regimented fashion within the newly constructed fort in St. Mary&#x27;s City but the greatest need perceived by the assembly was to allow for more spread-out farming. Leonard Calvert diplomatically lent support to the assembly&#x27;s wishes in letters to his brother, and Cecil Calvert largely acceded.

Mathias de Sousa was a settler in the colony who was described in historical records by one witness as being &quot;mulatto&quot; (mixed African and European heritage, although sometimes this meant anyone who was dark skinned). He originally arrived in the new colony as an indentured servant working for the Jesuit missionaries who had come with the settlers. He later gained his freedom and went on to become an assemblyman, making him (possibly) the first person of African heritage to participate in a legislative body in North America.

====Early mandates for religious tolerance====

Instructions from George Calvert, the First Lord Baltimore, and the holder of the grant to the new Maryland Colony specified in 1633 that the new governor and all settlers were to practice religious tolerance. Upon the death of George Calvert, additional instructions written by his son Cecil Calvert, the new Lord Baltimore, also required religious tolerance in the new colony. They were sent along with his younger brother Leonard Calvert who accompanied the first settlers to Maryland in 1634 and who was appointed the first governor of the Maryland Colony, although they also encouraged Catholics to be reserved about expressions of their faith in order not to antagonize Protestants. These instructions became the first laws of Maryland.

This intent was carried forward and expanded upon by the majority of early settlers of the time, who upon forming their first legislative assembly, called &quot;The Assembly of the Province of Maryland&quot;, passed the Maryland Toleration Act in 1649, further codifying the protection of religious freedom.

====First colonial town====

The original St. Mary&#x27;s settlement was laid out according to a Baroque town plan, with the settlers living closely in a town with church, stores and homes close by and outlying farms, fields, woods and orchards laid out in a grid or strips of land. However, most residents of St. Mary&#x27;s City later preferred to live on their tobacco plantations in the surrounding countryside. The settlement was meant to be the capital of the new Maryland Colony and Province of Maryland.

===Expansion===

====Tobacco successes and the expansion of slavery====

St. Mary&#x27;s City experienced an economic boom due to successful tobacco farming, which was the most important export commodity. Tobacco became an extremely valuable cash crop in the colony. This also drove the expansion of African chattel slavery. Older practices of allowing chattel slaves to gain freedom by converting to Catholicism or by eventually grandfathering indentured rights to them after many years of servitude were abolished. The character of the colony began to change more and more to a slave-based economy and slavery began to embed itself into the culture.

An increasing town population contributed to the desire for constructing public buildings, some of which were a state house, a Jesuit chapel, a jail, and an inn.

====Growing religious tensions====

During and after the English Civil War, fights between Protestants and Catholics developed in the colony. Often this tension went in long cycles, with extended periods where the tension was more repressed followed by acute periods where religious divisions would flare up, sometimes driving change in St. Mary&#x27;s City and Maryland in the process.

====Margaret Brent====
Margaret Brent was a business-savvy and successful Catholic settler in St. Mary&#x27;s City, who, contrary to the mores of the time that discouraged women from managing their own estates, although this was legal, insisted on managing her own business affairs. She had also traveled to the colony as a single, unmarried woman which was contrary to expectations of the time.

The law, in writing, had always been on Brent&#x27;s side, but the common practices and beliefs of the day did not always guarantee enforcement, especially in the male-dominated frontier environment of the colonies, far away from the courts of England. As a woman, she had to defend her legal rights in order to be sure they were respected.

Brent defended her right to run her own estate in common law court before the assembly in St. Mary&#x27;s City, making a spirited case, and won, making her the first woman in English North America to stand for herself in a court of law and before an assembly. She also demanded the right to vote in the assembly.

Brent also served as an attorney before the colonial court, mostly representing women of the colony. She is considered to have been very legally astute. Surviving records indicate that she pleaded at least 134 cases. Although she did not explicitly campaign for women&#x27;s rights in general, she is credited for having done so implicitly.


=== The Plundering Time ===

====1644–1646: Plundering Time====
The violence stemming from the English civil war eventually spread to the colonies and a Protestant raiding party attacked St. Mary&#x27;s City, driving off many settlers and burning several structures. After the attack there were only about 100 people still living in the town. The raiders took control of the city and added further fortifications.

The raiders plundered the homes of all the Catholic residents of the city who refused to renounce their faith and anyone who professed friendship to a Catholic. This would later be called the Plundering Time by the colonists.

====1647: Leonard Calvert retakes St. Mary&#x27;s City====
Leonard Calvert had spent a few years in exile from St. Mary&#x27;s City but remained in the colonies. During this time he married Margaret Brent&#x27;s sister which also brought Margaret Brent into the Calvert family as an in-law, advancing her in some ways to her advantage and in other ways to her detriment. Nearly two years later, Leonard Calvert managed to raise a militia and led an attack to retake St. Mary&#x27;s City. They succeeded in driving off the Protestant militia and regained control of the town.

Then Calvert and his men carried out successful raids on Kent Island in the Chesapeake, which had become a stronghold of his foes, defeating the force there. At this point Calvert had the upper hand, although the threat still remained. However, within a year, Leonard Calvert became sick and died, creating a temporary power vacuum in the colony and also worryingly for the residents of St. Mary&#x27;s City, leaving Calvert&#x27;s militia, which had been protecting the city, unpaid.

====Margaret Brent intervenes at a personal cost====

Margaret Brent had been named by Leonard Calvert as the executor of his last will and testament, a very unusual designation for a woman of her time. She therefore handled the liquidation of Leonard Calvert&#x27;s estate. However at the same time, Calvert&#x27;s still-unpaid militia had become a security issue for St. Mary&#x27;s City. Even if the militia simply disbanded due to the soldiers remaining unpaid, the city would then be vulnerable again to attack. And so Brent successfully petitioned the Maryland Assembly to grant her power of attorney over the holdings of Cecil Calvert, the Lord Baltimore, who was Leonard&#x27;s brother living in England. She then used proceeds from liquidating some of these holdings to pay the militiamen.

Although her actions were later defended by the Maryland assembly as necessary in an emergency, a strain emerged between the Calvert family in England and Brent. Even though the assembly stated that Brent&#x27;s actions may have in fact, helped to save the colony, the Calverts did not approve of Brent making a decision to spend money raised from Cecil Calvert&#x27;s assets.

In defense of Brent, the Maryland Assembly issued the following proclamation about her:

However this did not sway Cecil Calvert.

This dispute also set off racial tensions between the Brent family and Cecil Calvert in England, because Brent&#x27;s brother, who had also been in St. Mary&#x27;s City, had married a Native American princess. In the same letter accusing Margaret Brent of mishandling Leonard Calvert&#x27;s estate, Cecil Calvert also disparaged her brother, Giles Brent, for having married a Native American woman. At the end of the letter, Cecil Calvert ordered Brent and her brother and sisters to leave the Maryland Colony.

Although the assembly was largely supportive of Brent and largely took her side in the dispute with the surviving Calvert family in England, during this time she also petitioned for the right to vote in the assembly. However the assembly denied her that right because she was a woman. This was the first known attempt by a woman in English North America to gain the right to vote.

Despite appeals on her behalf by the Maryland assembly, Cecil Calvert had demanded by letter that she and her brother and sisters leave the Maryland colony. Consequently, Brent left the colony with her sister. They lived for a year on an island in the Potomac River and then moved to the Virginia colony. Other relatives moved directly to Virginia. Brent established a new estate there which she called &quot;Peace&quot;. She eventually became very successful and stayed in Virginia for the rest of her life.

===1649: Maryland assembly ratifies the &quot;Maryland Toleration Act&quot;===

The Maryland Toleration Act, crafted and passed by the reinstated Maryland assembly in St. Mary&#x27;s City, was the first law codified to mandate religious tolerance among Christians of various sects (especially Catholics and Protestants). It was approved not only to carry out the wishes of George Calvert and his son and Cecil Calvert that the colony be a place of religious toleration between Catholics and Protestants. More urgently, the act, which applied to all of the Maryland Colony, sought to settle once and for all the religious divisions that had triggered the recent fighting. The assembly at the time was majority Protestant, and the aristocratic leadership, including the governorship of the colony was Catholic.

The act remained in effect for 40 years, and contributed to relative peace in the colony during that time.

===Stagnation===

====1660s: Problems in the tobacco economy====

In the 1660s tobacco, which had long been a lucrative boom crop, began to experience price declines. This was likely due to increased production and competition in other colonies. The problem was then aggravated by Maryland planters cutting their tobacco product with other leaves in order to make up for the decrease in the price of a tobacco barrel. Although helpful in the very short run, in the longer run this cutting practice hurt the reputation of Maryland tobacco in England and further devalued the yearly tobacco crops. All of this began, in stages, to have a destabilizing effect on the Maryland Colony, which then further aggravated latent religious tensions between the majority Protestant planters and the Catholic aristocratic leadership.

All of this further intensified reliance on slavery in St. Mary&#x27;s City, as plantation owners sought to eliminate the cost of paid labor in producing tobacco.

====1676: Original brick Maryland Statehouse constructed====

In 1676, the original Maryland Statehouse, the home of the Maryland colonial assembly, was finished. The current reconstructed statehouse is not in the original location, which today lies under the churchyard of the adjacent Trinity Episcopal Church. When the original statehouse was dismantled in 1829, Trinity was built out of the statehouse bricks.

====1678: First printing house in southern colonies opens in St. Mary&#x27;s City====
Moving to St. Mary&#x27;s City in 1678, William and Dinah Nuthead became the first printers in Maryland. While Dinah Nuthead was illiterate, she would often help her husband in operating the printing press. By copying the letters and the processes of her husband, Dinah was able to continue the printing business following her husband&#x27;s death in 1695. After gaining a license to print from the colonial government, Dinah became the first female printer in the colony. When Dinah moved to Annapolis, Maryland in 1695, she was able to continue their printing business in the new location.

===Decline===

====1689: Watershed eruption of religious conflict====

In 1689, about forty years after the passage of the Maryland Toleration Act, sectarian tensions between Protestants and Catholics became so great that Protestant settlers revolted against the Lords Baltimore in the Protestant uprising in Maryland. The English Crown took over the Maryland colony and appointed royal governors, replacing the Calverts.

Legally mandated religious tolerance was abolished, first by Royal decree and then later by a law passed by a now majority-Protestant state assembly, in the new capital in Annapolis.

====1690s: Catholics lost the right to vote, other anti-Catholic policies implemented====

In 1692 Catholics in the Maryland Colony lost the right to vote. Catholics were also no longer allowed to worship in public and could only worship in their private homes. Laws were also passed limiting new Roman Catholic immigration to the colony.

Although a Catholic person&#x27;s right to vote in Maryland would be reinstated by the state assembly some decades later, other forms of discrimination against Catholics would continue through most of the next century and would leave lasting religious tensions in Maryland felt all the way through to the election of John F. Kennedy just past the mid-20th century.

====Relocation of Maryland Capital====

The new Protestant Maryland governor Sir Francis Nicholson relocated the capital from St. Mary&#x27;s City to the more central Annapolis (then called &quot;Anne Arundel Town&quot;) in 1695. The colonial statehouse in St. Mary&#x27;s was turned into a Protestant church the same year.

In 1695 St. Peters freehold, the former home of Maryland governors in St. Mary&#x27;s City, was destroyed in an explosion. Whether this was an intentional act or an accident is not known, as a large gunpowder magazine had been stored in its basement. The freehold had briefly been the home of the new Protestant Governor Francis Nicholson until he ordered the colonial capital moved to Annapolis. Prior to this the freehold had been the home of Philip Calvert, the former Catholic Governor of the Maryland colony and Cecil Calvert&#x27;s half-brother until his death in 1682.

====Anti-Catholic policies and discrimination in the 18th century====

During the 18th century, Catholics became a persecuted minority group in Maryland, including St. Mary&#x27;s county. Catholics were denied the right to serve in the militia, taxed double when money had to be raised for the military, and continued to be discouraged from immigrating. Wealthy Catholics often became crypto-Catholics (practicing their religion in secret and sending their children abroad to get Catholic educations), but poor Catholics could not afford this and were more vulnerable to discrimination practices. Consequently, over the generations, many converted to Protestantism in order to avoid discrimination. By the late 18th century, the Catholic population had dropped to 9%.

====Abandonment of the city====

With the seat of government gone, the town lost its reason to exist. Remaining inhabitants were mostly farmers. The former town center was converted to agricultural land, and archaeological remains from the colonial town were undisturbed in the ground.

===1700–1865: Antebellum slave plantation era===

====Early 18th century: Consolidation of farms====

The small remaining farms in St. Mary&#x27;s City were consolidated into a large antebellum-style slave plantation by the Brome-Howard family, which operated through a majority of the 19th century. The main plantation house was built over the ruins of one of the Calvert residences.

====Civil War====

During the Civil War, Union troops occupied St. Mary&#x27;s County, which like a large part of Maryland at the time, had Southern sympathies. Piers and wharfs in St. Mary&#x27;s County were burned by Union forces in order to stop trade with the confederacy which was only across the Potomac River. Brome&#x27;s Wharf in St. Mary&#x27;s City was also burned, as it was a part of what was by then the Brome-Howard Plantation, owned by Doctor Brome, a slave-owner and a likely confederate sympathizer. There is archeological evidence that the Union Army may have occupied the plantation for some time. Records show that Brome later complained that Union troops had damaged his piano while ransacking the main plantation house.

Records show that one quarter of the 66 people living under slavery at Doctor Brome&#x27;s plantation in St. Mary&#x27;s City escaped during the Civil War and at least two of them then joined the Union Army. Even before slavery was legally abolished, the Union Army had a policy allowing enslaved men to gain their freedom if they became Union soldiers. Other records show that the total number of people living under slavery there during this time was 59.

Two men who had escaped slavery from the St. Mary&#x27;s City area, Alexander Gough and William Gross, joined the famed 38th United States Colored Infantry Regiment of the Union Army, which won unit citations for valor in the Battle of Chaffin&#x27;s Farm (also known as the &quot;Battle of New Market Heights&quot;) in the American Civil War. Gough is known to have survived the war and lived the rest of his life in Baltimore. Two other African American men from the area, William H. Barnes and James H. Harris both from Great Mills (which is just to the north of St. Mary&#x27;s City), who had been free tenant farmers before the war, also served in the same regiment. Harris and Barnes each received the Medal of Honor for their actions in the Battle of Chaffin&#x27;s Farm. There is evidence suggesting that additional slaves from the Brome plantation fought in the war as well. In total, over 700 African Americans from St. Mary&#x27;s County served in the Union Army during the Civil War.

The United States Colored Troops Memorial Statue, in Lexington Park, Maryland, seven miles north of St. Mary&#x27;s City, honors and memorializes African American soldiers from St. Mary&#x27;s County, including the men of the 38th United States Colored Troops Regiment, who served as soldiers or sailors in the Union cause during the American Civil War. An educational plaque at the site specifically mentions Barnes and Harris and how they received the Medal of Honor.

====Post-Civil War farming====

The Civil War ended slavery on the plantation and the area remained mostly under a large farm, worked by tenant farmers and owned by descendants of the original owners until the 20th century. By the mid-20th century, few 17th-century buildings still stood. The town center site appeared to be farmland with the exception of a few private residences, and also after 1840, a slowly expanding female seminary school that began with just a small part of the total area.

====Writings about the decline of St. Mary&#x27;s City====
In 1838 the novel &quot;Rob of the Bowl&quot; was published; it was a story about the struggle for religious tolerance in Maryland and was written by John Pendleton Kennedy, and was set in St. Mary&#x27;s City and also neighboring St. Inigoes, Maryland. The book opens with a poem that Kennedy selected as a re-attribution to describe St. Mary&#x27;s City long after its abandonment as the capital of Maryland.

This also refers to part of the 19th-century history and mythology of St. Mary&#x27;s City (in the State of Maryland) as a place where great things happened (such as the founding of the Colonial Government of Maryland and the birthplace of religious freedom in the United States) but which eventually became a ghost town. 


===St. Mary&#x27;s City&#x27;s resurgence===

==== 1840: Establishment of St. Mary&#x27;s Female Seminary ====

The book &quot;Rob of the Bowl&quot; tells a somewhat fictionalized story of the original St. Mary&#x27;s City. The author, after the book became popular, publicly lamented that there was no monument to memorialize the original St. Mary&#x27;s City and what happened there.

A few years later, in 1840, a women&#x27;s nondenominational seminary high school was established on the grounds of old St. Mary&#x27;s City, in response to Kennedy&#x27;s call for a monument. Its founders described it as a &quot;living monument&quot; to the beginnings of religious tolerance and established it to meet the educational needs of young women in the county and the state. The school was called St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary.

The school was intentionally made nondenominational, to honor, promote and memorialize religious tolerance, and also to help heal Protestant-Catholic tensions that still haunted St. Mary&#x27;s County at the time.

The name was changed to St. Mary&#x27;s Female Seminary, to clarify the school&#x27;s already existing female student-only mission.

====Early 1900s====

In 1926, the former St. Mary&#x27;s women&#x27;s Catholic seminary school (a boarding high school within the proper of old St. Mary&#x27;s City that was founded in 1840) was expanded to a two-year seminary female junior college combined with the last two years of high school (four years total). This was seen as a natural outgrowth of its former role as a now elite, state-funded women&#x27;s high school.

Through an act of the Maryland Legislature, St. Mary&#x27;s gender limitation was removed, and the word &quot;female&quot; was consequently dropped from the school&#x27;s name. However, although males may enroll, they are not offered housing. The name of the school was changed to St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary Junior College.

The St. Mary&#x27;s City Commission was chartered in 1966 by the State Assembly of Maryland and the Governor, Millard Tawes. The charter created the commission as &quot;a new, independent state agency&quot; reporting directly to the Governor of Maryland &quot;to preserve, develop and maintain&quot; St. Mary&#x27;s City as a state &quot;monument&quot;, and also to oversee ongoing archeological work.

The Junior College was ordered to be expanded to a four-year institution in 1966 (effective in 1968) and renamed &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland&quot;. It was chartered as a four-year public liberal arts college. Its mission was to provide a liberal arts college in the public sector to students who could not afford to attend elite private colleges. Reorganization was completed in 1967.

====1969: St. Mary&#x27;s City declared a National Landmark====

St. Mary&#x27;s was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1969.

The plan &quot;recommends acquisition of 1200 acres&quot; and suggests a museum, visitor center, working tobacco farm, public transportation, and reconstruction of the &quot;Ark&quot; and &quot;Dove&quot; as first steps in the reconstruction of the historic city.

====1976: World premiere of &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot;, by Kermit Hunter====

Commissioned to celebrate the founding of St. Mary&#x27;s City, Hunter&#x27;s outdoor drama prominently featured the characters of Leonard Calvert, William Claiborne, Ann Arundel, Richard Ingel, Mathias de Sousa and others, and launched the career of two-time Academy Award winner, Denzel Washington, who made his stage debut as DeSousa. Also in the cast were Tony winner Debra Monk as Ann Arundel), and actor/writer/director Jackson Heath as Ingel. On July 4, 1976, a &quot;Washington&quot; Post review of the play was read aloud on the floor of Congress and permanently entered in the Congressional Record.

====1980–present====

After years of exploratory test digs and historical detective work, and with the possible original key town locations having been narrowed down, archeological dig activity was increased significantly in a determined effort to finish uncovering the original layout of the colonial settlement.

In 1984, &quot;Lord Baltimore&#x27;s World&quot; was a large-scale, months-long colonial reenactment that was staffed by professional actors and also included live Shakespearean theater. It occurred within St. Mary&#x27;s City proper and celebrated the 350th anniversary of the arrival of Maryland&#x27;s first colonists.

After four years of intensified archeological digging, most of the original town layout had been discovered. It had been originally expected that the layout would be chaotic, but instead it was revealed that the town was actually carefully planned in a Baroque style, similar to Williamsburg, Virginia and Annapolis Maryland. Old St. Mary&#x27;s City, Annapolis and Williamsburg are the only three towns in North America planned and built in a Baroque layout.

The St. Mary&#x27;s City Commission, which had evolved through a variety of roles and slight name variations assigned to its historical research, reconstruction and preservation charter, was assigned a new name in 1991 by the State of Maryland: the Historic St. Mary&#x27;s Commission. This commission still has administrative authority over about half of St. Mary&#x27;s City; it is responsible for the preservation of more than 800 acres of land and 3 miles of shoreline.

===Present===

Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City is now a significant tourist attraction in the state of Maryland, visited by approximately 20,000 students per year, in addition to approximately 25,000 other tourists per year (a rough yearly total of 45,000 people). Expansion and development of the historic area continues, including reconstruction and replica creation of additional period sites. Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City is operated as an outdoor living history museum, and includes costumed actors portraying colonial-era life, museum exhibitions, and numerous reconstructed buildings.

St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland is now a nationally recognized elite educational institution in the public sector. In 2014, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, in its annual report, ranked St. Mary&#x27;s College as 5th in the nation under the category &quot;Top Public Schools&quot; in the &quot;Colleges&quot; category.

==Archaeological research in St. Mary&#x27;s City==
The National Park Service has described St. Mary&#x27;s City as &quot;probably the most intact 17th-century English town surviving in our nation represented entirely by archaeological resources.&quot; Numerous archaeological digs and research projects continue in St. Mary&#x27;s City. In the last 30 years, there have been more than 200 archaeological digs in the city.

===First excavations===
After explorations by Henry Chandlee Forman in the 1940s, excavations began in 1971 with the creation of the St. Mary&#x27;s City Historic Commission, a state institution tasked with discovering and preserving archaeological remains in St. Mary&#x27;s City, establishing a museum on the site, and conducting related historical research. Since then, much of the original colonial St. Mary&#x27;s City has been found. The Historic St. Mary&#x27;s City Commission continues to excavate the area today.

===The Historical Archaeology Field School===

In conjunction with St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, the Historic St. Mary&#x27;s Commission (formerly the &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s City Commission&quot;) runs the Historic Archeological Field School every summer that is attended by students from all over the United States and other countries as well. Many of its graduates now hold prominent positions in the field. The students not only study, but also work in many of the active archeological dig sites in St. Mary&#x27;s City. Providing extensive hands-on experience, the school teaches all aspects of professional archeological work, including working in real archeological digs, analyzing and conserving artifacts, as well as cataloging, archiving and related historical research. The school has been in existence for more than 40 years.

===Current work===
St. Mary&#x27;s City has numerous active archeological dig sites, focusing on precolonial, colonial and antebellum (slavery era) history.

===Notable discoveries===

Some important archeological discoveries in St. Mary&#x27;s City include:

*The site of the first printing house in the Southern colonies; a quantity of lead print type (for printing words), indicating that the site where it was found was the documented William Nuthead Printing House
*A 1645 fort with a surrounding moat, claimed to be the only structural remains of the English Civil War in the American Colonies
*Discovery of the site of St. John&#x27;s Freehold, where Maryland&#x27;s citizen government was instituted
*Façon de Venise glassware
*A set of Kütahya ceramics, one of only two known examples found in the United States
*19th-century slave quarters from St. Mary&#x27;s City&#x27;s later plantation period
*Three 17th-century lead coffins. One of these is suspected of being the coffin of the former colonial chancellor and also judge, Philip Calvert.
*The foundation of a Jesuit chapel
*Discovery of the site of St. Peters Freehold, the former home of Maryland Chancellor Philip Calvert. St. Peters freehold was destroyed in a violent explosion in 1695 when 900 pounds of gunpowder stored in its cellar were set off. Whether the explosion was intentional or an accident is unknown. The discovery was made by a team of visiting British scientists, and was featured in a British &quot;Time Team&quot; documentary that aired on The Learning Channel.
*Garret Van Sweringen&#x27;s Inn, a 17th-century inn founded by Garret Van Sweringen an Innkeeper and a leader in St. Mary&#x27;s City&#x27;s development
*Extensive artifacts from successive Native American occupations
*The 18th-century house of merchant and planter John Hicks, with an extensive ceramic assemblage
*Former slaves quarters and living area discovered on current campus grounds of St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, monument in honor of enslaved people erected by college

These findings come along with thousands of artifacts and bone fragments that have been cataloged and processed into St. Mary&#x27;s City historical museums and storage archives. These artifacts continue to be analyzed, and continue to advance period research in various fields.

===St. Mary&#x27;s Fort===
In late 2019, St. Mary&#x27;s Fort was unearthed to be later revealed in March 2021. The structure was built in 1634 by the first English colonists, to be their fourth colony in the New World after Jamestown (1607), Plymouth (1620), and Massachusetts Bay (1630). Moreover, a silver coin was discovered there, dated back to the reign of King Charles I.

<text>Queen&#x27;s College (QC) is a coeducational institution located in Nassau, Bahamas, operating under the auspices of the Bahamas Conference of the Methodist Church. Founded in 1890, Queen&#x27;s College is the oldest private school in the Bahamas.

== History ==

Queen&#x27;s College was the successor to the Bahamas Wesleyan Propriety Institution, which had opened in 1871. 

Queen&#x27;s College opened on 6 January 1890 after a committee had been formed to establish the school and Victoria Hall was built to house the new school. Mr. Wilson was recruited from Harrogate College, England, to be the school&#x27;s principal, with his wife to head up the girls&#x27; department of the school. 

The school operated under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society. In its first year, the school started with 67 students. By 1947–48, the school&#x27;s enrolment had increased to 335 pupils. 

By the late 1960s, the school&#x27;s population had grown to more than 2,000 students.

== Principals ==
From 1890 to 1925, the school continued under the guidance of S. B. Wilson and his successors, including Rev. W. J. P. White (c 1902) and Rev. Leonard Edge (1903–1908). 

In 1925, Rev Richard P. Dyer took up the appointment as headmaster, a position he which held until 1959. Dyer was succeeded by Geoffrey Litherland (1959–64), Neville Stewart (1964–71), and Hayden Middleton (1971–79).

The first Bahamian administrator of Queen&#x27;s College, Yvonne Noronha, was appointed vice principal of the college and headmistress of the primary school in 1978. This was followed by the appointment of Charles Sweeting in 1979. Sweeting served as principal until 1993. 

Vice Principal Philip Cash was appointed principal in 1993 and served until he died in June 1997. In November 1997, Andrea Gibson became the first woman principal and served until 2019. Virginia Minnis was appointed head of the early learning centre in September 1999 and was the first Bahamian to serve in this post.

The school&#x27;s current principal is Rev Henry Knowles, who has held the position since 2019.

== Current structure ==

Queen&#x27;s College consists of three sections: the early learning centre, a primary school and a high school. The school offers Advanced Placement courses, A+ certification, Advanced Subsidiary courses, SAT II course, and MOUS (Microsoft Office User Specialist Certification) certificates.

== Sports ==

The Comets, the school sporting team, has won awards in basketball, volleyball, swimming, track &amp; field, and soccer. For years, Queen&#x27;s College has placed second in the Bahamas Association of Independent Secondary Schools (BAISS) Track and Field Championship. In 2015, the Comets secured their first victory over the St. Augustine&#x27;s College (SAC) Big Red Machines, who were on a 20+ year winning streak.

<doc id="390509" wikidata="Q639241" url="?curid=390509" title="Międzyrzecz">
<text>Międzyrzecz (; , , ) is a town in western Poland, on the Obra and Paklica river, with 17,667 inhabitants (2020). The capital of Gmina Międzyrzecz and Międzyrzecz County. Since the Local Government Reorganization Act of 1998, it has been situated in Lubusz Voivodeship. In 1975–1998 Międzyrzecz was part of Gorzów Voivodeship. The town limits cover .

==Geography==

The town&#x27;s name refers to Mesopotamia (&quot;between rivers&quot;, ) and its location at the confluence of the Obra River and the Paklica tributary, in the west of the historic Greater Poland region. About halfway between the towns of Skwierzyna and Świebodzin, it is situated south of the regional capital Gorzów Wielkopolski and north of Zielona Góra.

The municipal area is in a particularly green part of Poland. Extensive forests and numerous lakes can be found in the vicinity, including two Natura 2000 protected areas south of the town.

Międzyrzecz is the seventh largest town in Lubusz Voivodeship. The number of inhabitants has slightly been on the decrease since the 1990s.

==History==

The settlement on the road leading from Magdeburg to Gniezno was first mentioned as &quot;Mezerici&quot; by the medieval chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg in the course of the 1005 campaign of King Henry II of Germany into the Polish lands of Duke Bolesław I Chrobry. The Old Polish name &quot;Mezyriecze&quot; first appeared in the 1112/16 &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; by Gallus Anonymus.
It remained a western outpost of the Duchy of Greater Poland, established by the 1138 Testament of Bolesław III Krzywousty, after the loss of Lubusz Land in the mid-13th century and was incorporated into the Poznań Voivodeship of the Polish Crown upon the coronation of King Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1320. Under the rule of his successor Casimir III the Great (1333–1370) German settlers began to migrate into the area in the course of the Ostsiedlung. Town privileges were confirmed by King Casimir IV Jagiellon in 1485. Międzyrzecz was a royal town of the Polish Crown and the seat of starosts (local royal administrators). In 1520 it was ravaged by the Germans.
The town remained part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until in the Second Partition of Poland of 1793 it was annexed together with the whole region of Greater Poland by the Kingdom of Prussia. The town at first was part of the South Prussia province, was ceded to the Poznań Department of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw by the 1807 Treaties of Tilsit, and upon the 1815 Congress of Vienna fell back to Prussia, administrated within the Grand Duchy of Posen. In 1818 the town became the capital of the Prussian &quot;Kreis Meseritz&quot; within &quot;Regierungsbezirk Posen&quot;. After the failed Greater Poland Uprising of 1848, it was incorporated into the Province of Posen, which, with Prussia, became part of the unified German Empire in 1871. According to a 1900 census, 20.2% of the population were Polish native speakers.

===20th century===
After World War I, upon the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918/19 and according to the Treaty of Versailles, the town was part of the small, mostwestern part of Greater Poland which remained part of Weimar Germany. From 1922 these lands, located close to the border with the Second Polish Republic, were administrated as the Prussian Province of Posen-West Prussia. Meseritz became the seat of the &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; governor, until in 1938 the province was dissolved and Meseritz was incorporated into the Province of Brandenburg. From 1934 to 1938, the Nazi administration had the &quot;Festungsfront Oder-Warthe-Bogen&quot; fortifications erected in the south of the town. During World War II, in Obrawalde (present-day Obrzyce within the city limits), from 1942 to 1945, Germans murdered over 10,000 people, mostly mentally ill and disabled, as part of the &quot;Aktion T4&quot;, but also prisoners of war and political opponents.

In the late days of World War II, Meseritz was occupied by Red Army forces in the course of the Vistula–Oder Offensive on 31 January 1945. Left to the Republic of Poland, it was incorporated into Poznań Voivodeship on July 7. The town&#x27;s re-incorporation to Poland was confirmed with the Potsdam Agreement and the implementation of the Oder–Neisse line. While the Polish autochthonous minority was allowed to remain in Międzyrzecz, the German speaking majority was expelled. Poles of whom a part had been expelled or left from former Kresy territories, annexed by the Soviet Union, re-settled the town.

<text>Jarocin () is a town in west-central Poland with 25,700 inhabitants (1995), the administrative capital of Jarocin County in Greater Poland Voivodeship.

Jarocin is a historical town, having been founded and granted city rights in the 13th century. The marketplace features a Ratusz town hall built between 1799 and 1804, which is now home to the Jarocin Regional Museum.

The town also became famous in the 1980s thanks to the Jarocin Festival, one of the first rock-punk music festivals of the former Warsaw Pact and in Europe. The first event was organised in 1980.

== History ==

The lordship of Jarocin was first mentioned in a 1257 deed issued by Duke Bolesław the Pious of Greater Poland. The town was conveniently located at the intersection of the trade routes from Wrocław to Toruń and from Poznań to Kalisz. It was a private town of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Pyzdry County in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

Jarocin was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the 1793 Second Partition of Poland and administered within the newly formed province of South Prussia. It was part of the Duchy of Warsaw from 1807–13 during the Napoleonic Wars, but was restored to Prussia afterwards. The town was included within the Grand Duchy of Posen from 1815 and the Province of Posen from 1848. It became part of the German Empire in 1871. In 1889 it was included within the newly created Jarotschin District of the Province of Posen.

Jarocin participated in the Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919) and had the first soldiers&#x27; council in the Province of Posen. Polish insurgents captured the local military barracks and rail junction on November 8–9, 1918, just days before Poland declared independence on November 11. It was subsequently included in the Second Polish Republic. 42 Polish insurgents from Jarocin and nearby settlements were killed in the uprising. In the interbellum Jarocin was a county seat in the Poznań Voivodeship.

The town was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1939 during World War II and administered within the newly formed province Reichsgau Wartheland as part of the district or county (&quot;kreis&quot;) of Jarotschin. Poles arrested during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; were imprisoned in the local prison. Many Polish citizens, especially Jews, were expelled and replaced with ethnic Germans from the Baltic states, Volhynia, and Bukovina in accordance with the German &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. Many inhabitants were also deported to forced labour in Germany. The Germans devastated the memorial at the mass grave of the fallen Polish insurgents of 1918–1919. A forced labor prison operated in the vicinity from January 1941 to January 1945. Nevertheless, the Polish resistance movement was organized in the town, including the Secret Military Organization and structures of the Polish Underground State. Several resistance members were captured by the Germans and then sentenced to death and executed in Dresden in 1943. Following the arrival of the Red Army and the end of the war in 1945, Jarocin was restored to Poland with however, a Soviet-installed communist regime that stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. The devastated insurgents&#x27; tombstone was renovated in 1948.

It was administratively located in the Kalisz Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998. In 2016, town limits were slightly expanded by including a part of the village of Bachorzew.

==Sights==

Main landmarks and points of interest include the old Radoliński Palace with an adjacent park, the Polish Rock Granary, a museum dedicated to Polish rock music, the &quot;Rynek&quot; (Market Square) filled with historic architecture, including the town hall, which also houses the historic museum, and the St. Martin&#x27;s Church, and several Greater Poland Uprising memorials.

==Sports==
The town&#x27;s most notable clubs are rugby union team , which competes in the Ekstraliga (Poland&#x27;s top division), and football team Jarota Jarocin, which competes in the lower leagues. The town has a parkrun event that meets in Radoliński Park.

<text>Krotoszyn (, &quot;Krotoshin&quot;) is a town in west-central Poland with 29,485 inhabitants . It is the seat of Krotoszyn County in the Greater Poland Voivodeship.

==History==

Krotoszyn was founded by local nobleman , participant of the Battle of Grunwald, and was granted town rights in 1415 by King Władysław II Jagiełło. It was a private town owned by the Krotoski, Niewieski, Rozdrażewski and Potocki families, historically located in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. After the town suffered a fire in 1453, King Casimir IV of Poland vested it with new privileges, establishing a weekly market and three annual fairs.

It developed as a regional center of trade and crafts, located at the intersection of the Kalisz–Głogów and Toruń–Wrocław trade routes. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in 1628, Protestant refugees from German states settled in the town. It was plundered by the Swedes, during the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1656, but soon recovered and famous fairs were held there.

It was annexed by Prussia in 1793 during the Second Partition of Poland. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia, and in 1871 it subsequently became part of Germany. During the German rule in the 19th century, the town was located in the Prussian province of Posen. The castle of Krotoszyn was the centre of a mediatised principality formed in 1819 out of the holdings of the Prussian crown and granted to the prince of Thurn und Taxis in compensation for his relinquishing control over the Prussian postal system and it was subjected to Germanisation. Famous Polish composer Fryderyk Chopin stopped in the town in 1829. During the Polish Greater Poland uprising (1848) Germans and Jews attacked the local Polish committee, and the Poles had to move their activities to Koźmin Wielkopolski. Later on, despite the Germanisation policies, Poles established a number of organizations, including an industrial society, a cooperative bank and a local branch of the &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society.

Many inhabitants took part in the Greater Poland uprising (1918–19), during which the town was liberated by the insurgents on 1 January 1919, nearly two months after Poland regained its independence.

===World War II===

The Germans attacked Krotoszyn on 1 September 1939, the first day of the invasion of Poland and World War II. On 2 September they bombed a train with Polish civilians fleeing the Wehrmacht from Krotoszyn, killing 300 people and on 3 September they captured the town. The Germans established a transit camp for Polish prisoners of war and over 4,500 Polish soldiers passed through the camp. In mid-September 1939, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; entered the town to commit various crimes against the Polish population.

During the German occupation the Polish population was subjected to mass arrests, Germanisation policies, discrimination, expulsions, executions and deportations to forced labour in Germany. Poles from Krotoszyn, including several local policemen and the town&#x27;s deputy mayor, as well as several alumni of local schools, were also murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. The Germans destroyed the memorial dedicated to local Polish insurgents of 1918–1919, while another monument plaque was hidden by Poles and thus preserved. Germany also established and operated a Nazi prison in the town. Nevertheless, local Poles managed to organize the underground resistance movement, which included secret Polish teaching, scout troops, a local branch of the Home Army, the Secret Military Organization and structures of the Polish Underground State. Independent underground Polish press was issued in the town.

The town was liberated by Soviet troops and local Poles in January 1945 and restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which then stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. Some members of the Polish resistance movement were persecuted by the communists after the war.

It was within Kalisz Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998.

==Economy==
The dominant trade is in grain and seeds, and the headquarters of the Polish branch of Mahle GmbH is located there.

==Demographics==

==Cuisine==
The officially protected traditional food originating from Krotoszyn is &quot;wędzonka krotoszyńska&quot;, a type of Polish smoked pork meat (as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland). Local traditions of meat production date back hundreds of years, and the first butchers&#x27; guilds were established shortly after granting town rights in the early 15th century.

==Sports==
The main sports club of the town is Astra Krotoszyn with football and volleyball sections.

<doc id="390513" wikidata="Q3414026" url="?curid=390513" title="Queen's College, London">
<text>Queen&#x27;s College is a private day school for girls aged 11–18 with an adjoining prep school for girls aged 4–11 located in the City of Westminster, London. It was founded in 1848 by theologian and social reformer Frederick Denison Maurice along with a committee of patrons. In 1853, it was the first girls&#x27; school to be granted a Royal Charter for the furtherance of women&#x27;s education. Until 2024, the college patron had always been a British queen.

The college has a distinctly liberal ethos based upon the principles of F. D. Maurice.

==History==
In 1845, David Laing, chaplain of the Middlesex Hospital, raised funds with a committee of patrons to acquire a building at 47 Harley Street with the intention of creating a home for unemployed governesses.

Laing was keen to develop the institution to provide governesses with an education and certification. In 1847, he acquired the agreement of professors from King&#x27;s College London to give lectures in the Home. Queen Victoria gave her assent, promise of funds and patronage. In 1847, the first lectures took place, the Committee of Education was established under the chair of F. D. Maurice, and number 45 was purchased. In December of the same year, the first certificates were issued. Meanwhile, it was decided to extend the reach of the education on offer to women who were not governesses.

The establishment of the college was met with criticism by the press, F. D. Maurice was forced to defend the intention of teaching mathematics to women against claims of its &#x27;dangerous&#x27; consequences.

The composers William Sterndale Bennett and John Pyke Hullah were among the founding directors.

In the early days of the college, lectures were given to a single classroom of girls ranging from 12 to 20 years of age. The younger pupils were soon to be given their own school at the back of the buildings, which was also open to boys. The Waiting Room became the place where girls would gather and be introduced by the Lady Resident to their chaperones who remained with them throughout their classes and were known as the &#x27;Lady Visitors&#x27; (one of them being Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley). When the college was separated from the Governesses&#x27; Benevolent Institution in 1853, a new Governing Council was established, with the &#x27;Visitor&#x27;, the Bishop of London as its figurehead, an arrangement which continues to this day. Following the resignation of Maurice in 1853, Richard Chenevix Trench became the first principal and took over as Chair of the Committee of Education.

The college had resisted attempts to become, or merge with, a college of London University. The Lady Resident Eleanor Grove and linguist Rosa Morison had left together in the 1880s because of this and they returned to lead College Hall, London.

The practice of offering lectures from visitors throughout the year is a tradition of the college.

During the Second World War, the college escaped destruction when a bomb exploded on the opposite side of Harley Street. The windows at the front of the building were smashed and plaster work damaged. The college continued to function during the war with classes held in bomb shelters constructed in the main corridor. Evacuation of the pupils to the Lake District and then to Northamptonshire was short-lived.

The college ceased to offer boarding accommodation in the 1980s and Kynaston House was re-modelled from the accommodation to offices, a senior common room and a library.

==School organisation==
Each student is assigned to a form of approximately 18–22 members. The forms are headed by a tutor and deputy, and take their name from the initials of the tutor. There are two or three forms in a year and each year is under the watch of a year head. The years comprise the three sections of the college, each with a further delegated head.
===Preparatory School===

==Ethos==


===Religious affiliation===
The college is Anglican in affiliation, stemming from its foundation under Christian Socialist F. D. Maurice. Half the principals since the college&#x27;s inception have been vicars or canons of the Anglican Church. Today, the college is associated with the nearby All Souls Church, Langham Place, whose vicar is the school chaplain. Prayers are said daily in the hall (except on Thursday), and the year begins with the reading of a prayer written specially for the college by Maurice. Members of other faiths are welcomed and a weekly Jewish assembly takes place.

==Calendar==

===Terms===
The three terms are named Michaelmas, Lent and Summer.

At the end of the Lent Term, Founder&#x27;s Day is observed, when thanks is given for the founding of the college at All Souls Church, which is also the location of the carol service at the end of the Michaelmas Term.

===Annual Gathering===
The Summer Term closes with the Annual Gathering, when pupils continue the tradition, begun in 1854, of lining the school corridor dressed all in white, accompanied by the staff in academic dress. The &#x27;Visitor&#x27;, the Bishop of London, or his representative, is introduced by form tutors and the Principal to every student in the college from Class 1 upwards and selected representatives of Classes 2 and 3. The event is followed by the Principal&#x27;s report to the governors, parents, staff and pupils on the academic year and an address from the Visitor.

==Alumnae==

Founded in 1891, the Old Queen&#x27;s Society exists to connect former pupils with each other and the school. The first Honorary Secretary was Frideswide Kekewich and the first President, Ellen Howard.

Known as Old Queens, alumnae have included many notable women over the school&#x27;s history, including:
*Camilla Croudace, Lady Resident at Queen&#x27;s College (1881–1906)
*Gertrude Bell (1884–86), archaeologist, cartologist, diplomat
*Jane Asher (1960-1962), actress and author
*Anna Wintour OBE (1960–63), editor-in-chief, &quot;Vogue&quot;
*Frances Helen Prideaux, the first woman to be competitively appointed as a surgeon to a London hospital

<text>Ostrów Wielkopolski () (often abbreviated &quot;Ostrów Wlkp.&quot;, formerly called simply &quot;Ostrów&quot;, , Latin: &quot;Ostrovia&quot;) is a city in west-central Poland with 70,982 inhabitants (2021), situated in the Greater Poland Voivodeship; the seat of Ostrów Wielkopolski County. It is the fifth-largest city in the voivodeship after Poznań, Kalisz, Piła and Konin.

It is located in the Kalisz Region in the south-eastern part of historic Greater Poland.

==History==
===Early history===

Recently, a small fortified dwelling dating from the 10th century was discovered on the north-east side of the town&#x27;s limits. An archeological excavation is now in progress. It was part of Poland since the establishment of the state in the 10th century.

The oldest known mention of Ostrów comes from a document from 1293. Ostrów received town rights in 1404 but the economic stagnation caused by fires, wars, and a weak 16th-century nobility, led to the town&#x27;s officials dropping its town status in 1711. Administratively it was located in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. In 1714, one of the nobles of Ostrów, , intervened at the royal court, for the status to be reinstated. To help the city grow, new settlers were exempt from taxes for six years. By the power of Grand Crown Marshal Franciszek Bieliński, the town received its status back with greater privileges. Another noble family, the Radziwiłł family took patronage over the town and looked over its many investments. The care of the town&#x27;s owners, work of its people, and dedication of its officials, as well as its location, favored the town&#x27;s continuous growth.

===Late modern period===
During the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793, the town was annexed by Kingdom of Prussia. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. It was re-annexed by Prussia, to be included within the initially autonomous Grand Duchy of Poznań in 1815. The cloth industry prospered in Ostrów until 1825, when Russia imposed tariffs on imported cloths, as a result of which many textile manufacturers moved east to the Russian Partition of Poland. In 1828 local noble Antoni Radziwiłł funded the construction of a new town hall. In 1845 the Royal Catholic Gymnasium was established, a significant Polish school in the Prussian Partition of Poland, which as the I Liceum Ogólnokształcące remains one of the most renowned high schools in Greater Poland. Ostrów then became an important center of Polish education, press and publishing in the region. Among the local Polish elites were Antoni Bronikowski, an outstanding Hellenist who translated the works of Plato, Homer, Thucydides and Xenophon into Polish, and poet . The establishment of a railroad hub in Ostrów was a vital turning point in its development, helping to lend the town prominent status on the local and national scene. In 1875 the first railway connections were opened, with Poznań and Kluczbork. The Primate of Poland Cardinal Mieczysław Halka-Ledóchowski was imprisoned in the local prison for two years by the Prussians, before they eventually expelled him from the country. After Poland regained independence, he was honored with a monument in the city.
Ostrów was an important center of Polish resistance and national liberation movements. One of the town&#x27;s historic episodes was the so-called Republic of Ostrów (&quot;Republika Ostrowska&quot;), which was the citizens’ upheaval of 1918. No blood was shed at that upheaval and all political powers were taken over from the Prussian authorities. The anniversary of the upheaval, November 10, is celebrated as the official Day of the City of Ostrów Wielkopolski. The first Polish mayor of Ostrów after regaining independence was , one of the leading independence activists and publishers in Ostrów before 1918. Following the Polish–Soviet War, from 1920, the 60th Infantry Regiment of the Polish Army was stationed in Ostrów Wielkopolski. In the interbellum, Ostrów was one of the fastest growing towns: the number of inhabitants doubled, showy houses were built, as well as new schools, stadiums and a swimming pool. Three new villa district were founded, and a modern railcar manufacturing (Fabryka Wagon) began. In 1934 the city limits were widely expanded and the villages of , , Wenecja and Krępa became new districts of Ostrów.

===World War II===

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe III&quot; entered the city on September 7–9, 1939 to commit various crimes against Poles, and also the &quot;SS-Totenkopf-Standarte Brandenburg&quot; operated in the city. During the German occupation of Poland, local Poles were subjected to mass arrests, imprisonment, deportations to concentration camps, expulsions, forced labour and massacres.

In late 1939 and early 1940, many Poles were arrested during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, then imprisoned in Kalisz and murdered in large massacres in the Winiary forest. Among the victims were activists, school principals, former participants of the Polish Greater Poland uprising (1918–19) against Germany, and pre-war mayor Stanisław Musielak. The Germans also established a Nazi prison for Poles in Ostrów. Further mass arrests of around 400 Poles from the county were carried out in April–May 1940, and many of the victims were then imprisoned in the local prison. Teachers from Ostrów were among Polish teachers murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp. A Nazi German labor camp, Staatspolizeistelle Litzmannstadt Arbeitserziehungslager Ostrowo, operated within the town&#x27;s limits, where 193 people died.

The Germans carried out first expulsions of Poles in October 1939, focusing on owners of bakeries, cafes, workshops and large apartments, which were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy, while expelled Poles were held in a transit camp in nearby Nowe Skalmierzyce for several weeks, and then deported to the General Government (German-occupied central Poland). Further 160 Poles were expelled in December 1939 to the Radom District of the General Government. Also a transit camp for Poles expelled from nearby villages was established in the local church. Further expulsions of Poles were carried out in 1940–1941.

The town was one of the major Polish conspiracy centers in the Greater Poland region. The Polish Secret Military Organization was founded in Ostrów in October 1939, and there were also structures of the Polish Underground State in the city. In 1941, after the Gestapo&#x27;s crackdown on the headquarters of the Poznań branch of the underground army Union for Armed Struggle-ZWZ, the headquarters were moved to Ostrów. From here the re-structure of the Poznań region of the Union was conducted. Polish underground press was printed in Ostrów and then distributed in Ostrów and other nearby towns, including Krotoszyn, Ostrzeszów, Pleszew. Ostrów was liberated from German occupation on January 23, 1945. The town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which then stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

===Recent period===

After the war Ostrów Wielkopolski was part of the Poznań Voivodeship, and from 1975 to 1998 it was the second largest city of the Kalisz Voivodeship (behind Kalisz).

In September 1945, the Polish resistance movement made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the local communist jail and liberate the prisoners. In July–August 1980, employees of local factories joined the nationwide anti-communist strikes, which led to the foundation of the &quot;Solidarity&quot; organization.

In 1979 Ostrów&#x27;s city limits were widely expanded for the second time, including the former villages , Szczygliczka, Zacharzew, Piaski, Stary Staw and Nowy Staw as new districts.

<text>Końskie () is a town in south-central Poland with 20,328 inhabitants (2008), situated in the Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship. Historically, Końskie belongs to the province of Lesser Poland, and since its foundation, until 1795 (see Partitions of Poland), it was part of Lesser Poland&#x27;s Sandomierz Voivodeship.

==History==

The oldest settlement which is now Końskie dates back to the 11th century. The burial ground from this period was discovered in the north part of the town in 1925. Końskie was mentioned in historical sources in 1124 for the first time, with Prandota of Prandocin (the progenitor of Odrowąż family) recorded as the owner of the settlement. For the next few centuries the settlement was owned by the Odrowąż family. Iwo Odrowąż, the bishop of Kraków, founded a parish and built a church dedicated to St. Nicholas in 1220–1224. The church was torn down in the 15th century and a new Gothic one was built in its place in the years 1492–1520. Some elements of the older Romanesque church were saved in the new one (e.g. the Romanesque tympanum, pictured). Końskie received city rights from King Augustus III of Poland on December 30, 1748. It was a private town, administratively located in the Żarnów County in the Sandomierz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. The Polish 14th Cuirassier Regiment was formed in Końskie by Stanisław Małachowski in 1809.

===World War II===

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in 1939, the town was invaded and then occupied by Germany, and the &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered to commit various crimes against the population.
Końskie was briefly visited by Adolf Hitler on September 10, 1939, while on the way to Kielce after landing on an airfield nearby. His car cavalcade visited the headquarters of General Walther von Reichenau at the local mansion. Hitler was followed by director Leni Riefenstahl who came a day later, ordered to film the Nazi German victory over Poland.

On September 11, 1939, the Germans carried out mass arrests of around 5,000 men over the age of 18 in the town and its vicinity after finding the bodies of several German policemen and soldiers (including general Wilhelm Fritz von Roettig, first German general to be killed in the conflict) reportedly mutilated by the Poles. The next day two dozen local Jews were summoned to dig graves for the German dead, and shortly afterwards, most of the Jews were shot by the Germans (). Reportedly, this event was witnessed by Riefenstahl who fainted when witnessing the random killing of on September 12, 1939.

Polish inhabitants of Końskie were also among Poles massacred by the Germans in the nearby village of Stadnicka Wola in April 1940. In 1941–1943, the Germans operated a prisoner-of-war camp for Soviet and Norwegian POWs in the town. About 26,000 POWs passed through the camp, 23,000 of whom either were murdered or died of starvation or epidemics. The Polish resistance movement organized escapes for the camp inmates.

Końskie was the centre of Polish underground resistance during World War II, with battles fought by the Armia Krajowa under Major Henryk Dobrzański (&quot;Hubal&quot;) in the nearby forests which the German army feared to enter. The town was taken over by the partisans for a few hours on the night of September 1, 1943, with a number of Gestapo agents assassinated. The Nazi Germans retaliated by executing civilians including Jews.

In 1944, during and following the Warsaw Uprising, the Germans deported thousands of Varsovians from the Dulag 121 camp in Pruszków, where they were initially imprisoned, to Końskie. Those Poles were mainly old people, ill people and women with children. 24,000 Poles expelled from Warsaw stayed in the town, as of 1 November 1944.

===Jewish history of Końskie===
The first mention of the Jewish community in Końskie dates to the 16th century. The pre World War II Jewish population of Końskie (known as Koinsk during the Russian occupation or Kinsk in Yiddish – קינצק / קינסק) comprised 60.6% of the total population of the town or about 6,500 persons as of September 1939. The town&#x27;s Jewish cemetery was founded in the 17th century, and expanded to span two hectares with the last burial in 1943.
After the Nazi German invasion of Poland, a ghetto was established in 1940 and closed off in the spring of 1941. The Jews of Końskie and Polish prisoners from Końskie and surrounding towns were forced to dig up the graves, which were used in the construction of pig farms, the Modliszewicach spire, and walls in Końskie and nearby villages. The cemetery was also used as a place of execution for both Jews and Poles.

The complete eradication of the Jewish population of Końskie took place on November 3–9, 1942, when all men, women, and children were loaded into cattle cars to Treblinka II and gassed. Approximately 600 Jews were murdered by the Nazis on the way to the camp. In the subsequent January 1943 &quot;Aktion&quot; in the Konskie Ghetto, the remaining Jews were ferreted out from attics and other hiding places and murdered. The Germans imprisoned several Poles in the local prison, and then deported them to concentration camps for rescuing Jews.

Koinsk appears under the name Bociany as the setting for Chava Rosenfarb&#x27;s Yiddish language novel of the same name. Bociany was published in English in the author&#x27;s own translation by Syracuse University Press in 2000. The translation won the John Glassco Award for Literary Translation in 2000.

The Koinsk Organization of Israel (&quot;Ha&#x27;Ayarah She&#x27;Li: Sefer Ha&#x27;Zikaron Le&#x27;Yehudei Konskiyah, Hebrew, 2001) commemorates the tragic death of the Jews of Konskie every year at The Diaspora Museum close to the 25th of the Jewish month of Cheshvan.

===Recent history===
In 1975–1998, the town was administratively located in the Kielce Voivodeship. Most of the town labour force was employed in the local foundry (Koneckie Zakłady Odlewnicze) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Since 1997 the town has developed into a major trade centre for small business.

The missiles hit the Iran Air aircraft, an Airbus A300, while it was flying its usual route over Iran&#x27;s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf, shortly after the flight departed its stopover location, Bandar Abbas International Airport. All 290 people on board were killed, making it one of the deadliest airliner shootdowns of all time. The shootdown occurred during the Iran–Iraq War, which had been ongoing for nearly eight years. &quot;Vincennes&quot; had entered Iranian territorial waters after one of its helicopters drew warning fire from Iranian speedboats operating within Iranian territorial limits.

The reason for the downing has been disputed between the governments of the two countries. According to the United States, &quot;Vincennes&quot; crew misidentified the aircraft as an F-14 Tomcat, a US-made fighter jet part of the Iranian inventory, despite it transmitting civilian identification codes. They assert that &quot;Vincennes&quot; and other warships repeatedly contacted the aircraft on both civilian and military air distress frequencies, but received no response. Bandar Abbas acted as a joint civil/military airport, and Flight 655 had departed behind schedule. The Iranian government maintains that the US recklessly shot down the aircraft, violating international law, after repeatedly provoking the Iranian forces. Some analysts blamed the overly aggressive attitude of &quot;Vincennes&quot; captain, William C. Rogers III, while others focused on more widespread issues and miscommunications on board.

The United States was criticized for the downing, especially in its initial response. While not issuing a formal apology, American president Ronald Reagan issued a written diplomatic note to Iran, expressing deep regret. In 1996, both governments reached a settlement in the International Court of Justice in which the US agreed to pay  million (equivalent to $ million in ) on an &quot;ex gratia&quot; basis to the families of the victims. As part of the settlement, the US did not admit liability for the shootdown.

== Background ==
By 1984, the war between Iraq and Iran had expanded to include air attacks against oil tankers and merchant shipping of neighboring countries, some of whom were providing aid to Iraq by shipping Iraqi oil. In 1987, a year preceding the shootdown, the Iraqi Air Force had attacked the US Navy frigate , killing 37 American sailors, after misidentifying it as an Iranian warship. The Stark incident culminated in the widening of the US Navy rules of engagement in the Persian Gulf, allowing warships to attack aircraft before being attacked. After a US oil tanker struck a mine in the Persian Gulf, additional warships were dispatched to the area; by late 1987, US forces had challenged and launched missiles at two Iranian fighter jets. In April 1988, the US engaged in Operation Praying Mantis in retaliation for mines, bringing significant damage to Iranian oil infrastructure and its military.

In response to the pattern of attacks on shipping, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff issued a &#x27;Notice to Airmen&#x27; (NOTAM) on 8September 1987, warning all Persian Gulf countries that civilian aircraft must monitor the International Air Distress frequencies and be prepared to identify themselves to US Navy ships and state their intentions; Iran disputed the validity and accuracy of these notices.

On the day of the incident, USS &quot;Vincennes&quot;, alongside and , had been assigned to take part in an escort traveling through the Strait of Hormuz. &quot;Vincennes&quot; was a &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;-class guided-missile cruiser, commissioned four years earlier, fitted with the then-new Aegis Combat System. With a crew of 400, it was under the command of Captain William C. Rogers III at the time of the shootdown. The Aegis system was capable of tracking multiple mobile targets simultaneously, both naval and airborne, and more importantly allowed rapid dissemination of information between different levels of the crew. Its crew was inexperienced in actual conflict, but had performed well in training scenarios.

At its narrowest point, the Strait of Hormuz is wide. As a result, to traverse the strait, ships must stay within sea lanes that pass through the territorial waters of Iran and Oman. It is normal for ships, including warships, entering or leaving the Persian Gulf to transit Iranian territorial waters. During the Iran–Iraq War the Iranian forces frequently boarded and inspected neutral cargo ships in the Strait of Hormuz in search of contraband destined for Iraq. While legal under international law, these inspections added to the tensions in the area.

== Flight and shootdown ==
The plane, an Airbus A300 (registered as ), was under the control of 38-year-old Captain Mohsen Rezaian, a US-educated veteran pilot with 7,000 hours of flight time, including over 2,000 in an Airbus A300. The first officer was 31 years old and the flight engineer was 33 years old. All had at least 2,000 flight hours.

Flight 655 left Bandar Abbas at 10:17 Iran Standard Time (UTC+03:30), 27 minutes after its scheduled departure time, due to an immigration issue. Before takeoff from runway 21, it was directed by the Bandar Abbas tower to turn on its transponder and proceed over the Persian Gulf. The flight was assigned routinely to commercial air corridor Amber 59, a lane on a direct line to Dubai airport. The short distance made for a simple flight pattern: climb to , cruise, and descend into Dubai. The airliner was transmitting the correct transponder &quot;identification, friend-or-foe&quot; (IFF) code typical of a civilian aircraft (mode 3) and maintained radio contact in English with appropriate air traffic control facilities throughout the flight (see ).
On the morning of 3 July 1988, USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; was passing through the Strait of Hormuz, returning from an oil tanker escort duty. A helicopter deployed from the cruiser reportedly received small arms fire from Iranian patrol vessels as it observed from high altitude. &quot;Vincennes&quot; moved to engage the vessels, in the course of which both sides violated Omani waters and left after being challenged by a Royal Navy of Oman patrol boat. &quot;Vincennes&quot; continued to pursue the Iranian gunboats, entering Iranian territorial waters. Two other US Navy ships, and , were nearby.

In the meanwhile, Flight 655, proceeding along its scheduled route, was on an ascending flight path towards &quot;Vincennes&quot;. In the time that followed (the specifics of which are debated, see below), &quot;Vincennes&quot; incorrectly assumed the aircraft to be hostile and issued 10 challenges to airliner, seven on the Military Air Distress (MAD) frequency, and three on the International Air Distress (IAD) frequency. &quot;Sides&quot; additionally made one challenge on the civilian frequency after those of &quot;Vincennes&quot;. The aircraft was not equipped to receive military transmissions, and the civilian challenges received no responses. With unanswered challenges, the crew of &quot;Vincennes&quot; commenced the process to engage the aircraft. Flight 655 made its final transmission at 10:24:11 to acknowledge a hand-off from Bandar Abbas approach controllers:

10:24:07 – Bandar Abbas Approach: &quot;Iran Air 655 roger, contact Tehran Control 133.4, have a nice flight.&quot;
10:24:11 – IR655: &quot;Thank you, good day.&quot;

Eleven seconds later, at 10:24:22, with the aircraft at a range of , &quot;Vincennes&quot; fired two SM-2MR surface-to-air missiles. The first missile intercepted the airliner at 10:24:43 at a range of , and the second missile intercepted the airliner shortly after. The plane disintegrated immediately into three pieces (cockpit, wing section, and the tail section) and soon crashed into the water. None of the 290 passengers and crew on board survived. Much of the wreckage, including the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, was never recovered.

At the time the missiles were launched, the &quot;Vincennes&quot; was located at , placing it within the limit of Iranian territorial seas. The location of &quot;Vincennes&quot; in Iranian territorial waters at the time of the incident was admitted by the US government in legal briefs and publicly by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral William J. Crowe, on &quot;Nightline&quot;.

=== Radio communication ===
The official International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) report stated that 11 attempts were made to contact Iran Air Flight 655 from the &quot;Vincennes&quot; and &quot;Sides&quot;, seven on military frequencies and four on commercial frequencies, addressed to an &quot;unidentified Iranian aircraft&quot; and giving its speed as , which was the ground speed of the aircraft their radar reported. Flight 655&#x27;s crew, however, would have seen a speed of on their cockpit instruments, which was their indicated airspeed, possibly leading them to conclude that &quot;Vincennes&quot; was talking to another aircraft. Both &quot;Sides&quot; and &quot;Vincennes&quot; tried contacting Flight 655 on several civilian and military frequencies. The ICAO concluded that Flight 655&#x27;s crew assumed the three calls they received before the missiles struck must have been directed at an Iranian P-3 Orion, which was also taking off from Bandar Abbas.

The crew likely were monitoring the civilian international air-distress (IAD) frequency at the time of the shootdown. In its report, the ICAO found, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, that &quot;American warships in the gulf had no equipment that allowed them to monitor civilian air traffic control radio frequencies&quot;, and had they had such capabilities air traffic control transmissions would have identified the flight. In its ICJ statement, Iran disputed this by claiming that the Department of Defense&#x27;s report explicitly mentioned the &quot;Vincennes&quot;&#x27; VHF radio equipment that would have allowed it to monitor civilian air traffic control frequencies, as well as other US surveillance activities in the Persian Gulf region that would have alerted them of the aircraft&#x27;s nature. The US objected to this claim, saying that most of its military vessels were only equipped with VHR radios capable of listening to the IAD frequency.

=== Nationalities of the victims ===

According to the documents Iran submitted to the International Court of Justice, the aircraft was carrying 290 people: 274 passengers and a crew of 16. Of these 290, 254 were Iranian, 13 were Emiratis, 10 were Indians, six were Pakistanis, six were Yugoslavs, and one was an Italian.

=== US government accounts ===
According to the US government, Flight 655 was first detected immediately after take-off by &quot;Vincennes&quot;, transmitting IFF mode 3 (civilian). As the flight had originated at Bandar Abbas, which served both as a base for Iranian F-14 operations and as a hub for commercial flights, all departing aircraft were by default &quot;assumed hostile&quot;. When the identification supervisor responsible, Petty Officer Andrew Anderson, interrogated the aircraft again soon after with his IFF radio, he did not reset the range and received a short IFF mode 2 transmission (indicative of a military aircraft), likely from unrelated ground aircraft taking-off at Bandar Abbas. As a result, Flight 655 was erroneously tagged by Anderson with this military classification and squawk code. The mistagged squawk code corresponded to an F-14 Tomcat that had flown out of Bandar Abbas a week before, leading the crew of &quot;Vincennes&quot; to believe the airliner was an Iranian fighter jet. For the entirety of its journey Flight 655 solely squawked civilian IFF codes. Due to the flight&#x27;s slight delay, the dark environment of the Combat Information Center (CIC), and confusion over time zones, Anderson missed Flight 655 in commercial flight listings.

Escalations began when &quot;Vincennes&quot; helicopter received warning fire after approaching close to Iranian gunboats, in contravention of the rules of engagement at the time. According to the US, the gunboats had been following merchant ships in an aggressive manner and the helicopter had been deployed after they had been sighted by &quot;Montgomery&quot;. While &quot;Vincennes&quot; engaged with the gunboats, it entered Iranian territorial waters, with sharp turns causing disruption inside. In what the US government later termed &quot;scenario fulfilment&quot; – a form of confirmation bias in which personnel carry out a training scenario, believing it to be reality – information was erroneously communicated that not only was the aircraft squawking military codes, but that it was also descending on an attack profile. The Aegis system continued to correctly record the aircraft as climbing past , instead, and this was reflected on the CIC&#x27;s numerical displays. Captain Rogers had earlier acknowledged a remark that the aircraft was &quot;possible COMAIR [commercial aviation]&quot;. Following the misidentification and unreciprocated radio challenges, the aircraft was shot down (see ).

Department of Defense (DoD) officials initially said that &quot;Vincennes&quot; had shot down an Iranian F-14, but issued a retraction within hours and confirmed Iranian reports that the target was instead a civilian Airbus. According to the DoD, &quot;Vincennes&quot; mistakenly identified the airliner as an attacking military fighter and misidentified its flight profile as being similar to that of an F-14A Tomcat during an attack run; however, the cruiser&#x27;s Aegis Combat System recorded the plane&#x27;s flight plan as climbing (not descending as in an attack run) at the time of the incident. Alongside the vague nature of the challenges issued by &quot;Vincennes&quot;, confusion may have arisen as the hailed speed stated in the transmissions was the ground speed, while the pilot&#x27;s instruments displayed airspeed, a difference.

In 1992, journalists from &quot;Newsweek&quot; obtained a full copy of the DoD&#x27;s internal report which included a map and coordinates of &quot;Vincennes&quot;. They concluded that &quot;Vincennes&quot; was about inside Iranian territorial waters at the time of the shootdown. This was admitted in a report by Admiral William Fogarty, entitled &quot;Formal Investigation into the Circumstances Surrounding the Downing of Iran Air Flight 655 on 3July 1988&quot; (the &quot;Fogarty report&quot;). The Fogarty report stated, &quot;The data from USS &quot;Vincennes&quot;&#x27; tapes, information from USS &quot;Sides&quot; and reliable intelligence information, corroborate the fact that [Iran Air Flight 655] was on a normal commercial air flight plan profile, in the assigned airway, squawking Mode III 6760, on a continuous ascent in altitude from takeoff at Bandar Abbas to shoot-down.&quot;. The Fogarty report also claimed, &quot;Iran must share the responsibility for the tragedy by hazarding one of their civilian airliners by allowing it to fly a relatively low-altitude air route in close proximity to hostilities that had been ongoing.&quot;

The crew of USS &quot;Sides&quot; – which issued one final challenge after the 10 of &quot;Vincennes&quot; – indicated that they had from take-off identified Flight 655 as a commercial flight, according to the ICAO. Unlike &quot;Vincennes&quot;, its operators recalled that they had never observed the IFF Mode 2 squawk that initially identified the flight as a military aircraft. Of the 11 challenges, only the one made by &quot;Sides&quot; identified the aircraft&#x27;s squawk code.

=== Iranian government account ===
According to the Iranian government, the shootdown was both intentional and unlawful. Even if a mistaken identification was made – which Iran never accepted – it argued that this constituted negligence and recklessness amounting to an international crime, not an accident.

In particular, Iran expressed skepticism about claims of misidentification, noting that the cruiser&#x27;s advanced Aegis radar correctly tracked the flight and its Mode III beacon; two other US warships in the area, &quot;Sides&quot; and &quot;Montgomery&quot;, also identified the aircraft as civilian; and the flight was well within a recognized international air corridor. It also noted that the crew of &quot;Vincennes&quot; were trained to handle simultaneous attacks by hundreds of enemy aircraft. Iran found it more plausible that &quot;Vincennes&quot; was looking for an opportunity to use its force, and that it had been predisposed to treat Iran as hostile, citing a statement by David Carlson, commander of the USS &quot;Sides&quot;, published in the September 1989 issue of &quot;Proceedinqs&quot; in which he stated that &quot;Vincennes&quot; &quot;hankered for an opportunity to show its stuff&quot;..

The US had previously issued a NOTAM, warning aircraft that they were at risk of &quot;defensive measures&quot; if they had not been cleared from a regional airport and if they came within of a warship at an altitude less than . Iran stated that Flight 655 had been cleared from a regional airport and was well outside those limits when it was shot down. The crew of the Vincennes had been incorrectly briefed that F-14s had been supplied to Iran with air-to-ground ordnance, when in reality they were only capable of air-to-air. Even if the plane had truly been an Iranian F-14, Iran argued that the US would not have had the right to shoot it down, as it was flying within Iranian airspace and did not follow a path that could be considered an attack profile, nor did it illuminate &quot;Vincennes&quot; with radar. Prior to the incident, &quot;Vincennes&quot; had entered Iranian territorial waters and was inside these waters when it launched its missiles. Even had the crew of Flight 655 made mistakes, they stated, the US government should remain responsible for the actions of &quot;Vincennes&quot; crew, under international law.

Iran pointed out that in the past, &quot;the United States has steadfastly condemned the shooting down of aircraft, whether civil or military, by the armed forces of another State&quot; and cited El Al Flight 402, Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114, and Korean Air Lines Flight 007, among other incidents. Iran also noted that when Iraq attacked the USS &quot;Stark&quot;, the US found Iraq fully responsible on the grounds that the Iraqi pilot &quot;knew or should have known&quot; he was attacking a US warship. Speaking to the United Nations Security Council, Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs, called the shootdown the &quot;most inhuman military attack in the history of civil aviation&quot;, caused by a &quot;reckless and incompetent naval force&quot;.

=== Independent sources ===

In 1989, prior to the public exposure of &quot;Vincennes&quot;&#x27; position inside Iranian waters on &quot;Nightline&quot; by Admiral William Crowe, Professor Andreas Lowenfeld of the editing board of the &quot;American Journal of International Law&quot; criticized the official US position that the US was not legally liable for the incident:
Lowenfeld also pointed out that the amount of compensation paid for Iranian victims was one-tenth the amount demanded from Iraq for American dead aboard the USS &quot;Stark&quot;.
One legal scholar noted in the &quot;Yale Journal of International Law&quot;: &quot;The downing of Flight 655 should not be deemed lawful merely because the &quot;Vincennes&quot;&#x27; commanding officer reasonably mistook the situation as presenting an integrated surface and air attack. Reconceptualizing the incident as a mistake problem does not excuse the &quot;Vincennes&quot; from liability.&quot;

In an article published in &quot;Newsweek&quot; on 13 July 1992, John Barry and Roger Charles argued that Rogers behaved recklessly and without due care. The &quot;Newsweek&quot; article also accused the US government of a cover-up; Admiral Crowe denied any knowledge: An analysis of the events by the International Strategic Studies Association described the deployment of an Aegis cruiser in the zone as irresponsible and felt that the value placed on Aegis cruisers by the US Navy had played a major part in the setting of a low threshold for opening fire. &quot;Vincennes&quot; had been nicknamed &quot;RoboCruiser&quot; by crew members and other US Navy ships, in reference to both its Aegis system and the supposed aggressive tendencies of its captain.

The International Court of Justice case relating to &quot;the Aerial Incident of July 3, 1988&quot; (&quot;Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America&quot;), was dropped on 22 February 1996 following settlement and compensation by the United States.

Three years after the incident, Admiral Crowe admitted on American television show &quot;Nightline&quot; that &quot;Vincennes&quot; was inside Iranian territorial waters when it launched the missiles, contradicting earlier Navy statements. The ICAO report of December 1988 placed &quot;Vincennes&quot; well inside Iran&#x27;s territorial waters.

Commander David Carlson, commanding officer of USS &quot;Sides&quot;, the warship stationed nearest to &quot;Vincennes&quot; at the time of the incident, is reported to have said that the destruction of the aircraft &quot;marked the horrifying climax to Captain Rogers&#x27;s aggressiveness, first seen four weeks ago&quot;. His comment referred to incidents on 2June, when Rogers had sailed &quot;Vincennes&quot; too close to an Iranian frigate undertaking a lawful search of a bulk carrier, launched a helicopter within of a small Iranian craft despite rules of engagement requiring a separation, and opened fire on small Iranian military boats. Of those incidents, Carlson commented: &quot;Why do you want an Aegis cruiser out there shooting up boats? It wasn&#x27;t a smart thing to do.&quot; He said that Iranian forces he had encountered in the area a month prior to the incident were &quot;pointedly non-threatening&quot; and professional. At the time of Rogers&#x27;s announcement to higher command that he was going to shoot down the plane, Carlson is reported to have been thunderstruck: &quot;I said to folks around me, &#x27;Why, what the hell is he doing?&#x27; I went through the drill again. F-14. He&#x27;s climbing. By now this damn thing is at 7,000 feet.&quot; Carlson thought the &quot;Vincennes&quot; might have more information and was unaware that Rogers had been wrongly informed that the plane was diving. Carlson is reported to have written in the &quot;US Naval Proceedings&quot; that he had &quot;wondered aloud in disbelief&quot; on hearing of &quot;Vincennes&quot;&#x27; intentions. In speculating on the &quot;climate&quot; that led up to the incident, Carlson stated that the crew of &quot;Vincennes&quot; &quot;felt a need to prove the viability of Aegis in the Persian Gulf, and that they hankered for the opportunity to show their stuff.&quot; 

== Potential factors ==

* The Aegis System software at that time reused tracking numbers in its display, constituting a user interface design flaw. The Aegis software initially assigned the on-screen identifier TN4474 to Flight 655. Before &quot;Vincennes&quot; fired, the Aegis software switched the Flight 655 tracking number to TN4131 and recycled Flight 655&#x27;s old tracking number of TN4474 to label a fighter jet 110 miles away. When the captain asked for a status on TN4474, he was told it was a fighter and descending. &quot;Scientific American&quot; rated it as one of the worst user interface disasters.

* A psychological evaluation of the crew, requested by Admiral Fogarty, concluded that stress and inexperience of the crew in warfare resulted in misjudgment and unconscious distortion of data, which played a significant role in the misinterpretation of the data of the Aegis system.

* The ship&#x27;s crew did not efficiently consult commercial airliner schedules, due to the darkness of their working space and confusion over to which time zone the schedules referred—the scheduled flight times used Bandar Abbas airport time, while &quot;Vincennes&quot; was on Bahrain time. The airliner&#x27;s departure was 27 minutes later than scheduled. The Combat Information Center was dark, and its lights flickered every time &quot;Vincennes&quot; fired at the speedboats. Petty Officer Andrew Anderson, who first picked up Flight 655 on radar and thought it might be a commercial aircraft, is said to have missed the flight as he was searching in the navy&#x27;s listing of commercial flights.

* An Iranian P-3 Orion was in the area some time before the attack, and some reports explained why no radar signals were detected from Iran Air Flight 655. Other reports state that the Airbus was immediately detected after takeoff by the cruiser&#x27;s AN/SPY-1 radar at a range of .

* According to Capt. Richard McKenna (surface commander of Capt. Will Rogers), &quot;Vincennes&quot; was initially authorized to send a helicopter to investigate the situation with the gun boats. Later on, when he realized that &quot;Vincennes&quot; had turned north and swapped positions with &quot;Montgomery&quot;, he commanded &quot;Vincennes&quot; to leave the helicopter in place and return immediately. According to an interview after his retirement, Capt. McKenna believed that he felt the situation was not initially out of control and maybe &quot;Vincennes&quot; was looking for trouble. He said &quot;my own personal opinion is it really did feel that they were looking for action when they went to see the &quot;Elmer Montgomery&quot;, um my own feeling is that the situation was not out of control, it was really my call and yet even though they were assigned another station, they took it upon themselves to be there and to that extent I feel that you know, I mean that&#x27;s that&#x27;s where the general feeling and not not just my own, comes that maybe they were looking for trouble.&quot;

* The psychology and mindset after engaging in a battle with Iranian gunboats. Claims were made that &quot;Vincennes&quot; was engaged in an operation using a decoy cargo ship to lure Iranian gunboats to a fight. These claims were denied by Fogarty in &quot;Hearing Before The Investigation Subcommittee and the Defense Policy Panel of the Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, One Hundred Second Congress, Second Session, 21 July 1992.&quot; Also, the initial claims of &quot;Vincennes&quot; being called for help by a cargo ship attacked by Iranian gunboats have been ruled out. That leads to claims that the Iranian gunboats were provoked by helicopters inside Iranian waters, not the other way around.

== Aftermath ==

The event sparked an intense international controversy, with the US criticized for its account. In mid-July 1988, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati asked the United Nations Security Council to condemn the United States, saying the attack &quot;could not have been a mistake&quot; and was a &quot;criminal act&quot;, a &quot;massacre&quot;, and an &quot;atrocity&quot;. George H. W. Bush, then-vice-president of the United States in the Reagan administration, defended his country at the UN by arguing that the US attack had been a wartime incident and the crew of &quot;Vincennes&quot; had acted appropriately to the situation. The Soviet Union asked the US to withdraw from the area and supported efforts by the Security Council to end the Iran–Iraq War. Most of the remainder of the 13 delegates who spoke supported the U.S. position, saying one of the problems was that a 1987 resolution to end the Iran–Iraq war had been ignored. Following the debate, Security Council Resolution 616 was passed expressing &quot;deep distress&quot; over the US attack and &quot;profound regret&quot; for the loss of human lives, and stressing the need to end the Iran–Iraq War as resolved in 1987.
Inside Iran, the shootdown was perceived as a purposeful attack by the United States, signaling that the US was about to enter into a direct war against Iran on the side of Iraq. 

In February 1996, the US agreed to pay Iran US$131.8 million in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the US in the International Court of Justice relating to this incident, together with other earlier claims before the Iran–United States Claims Tribunal. US$61.8 million of the claim was in compensation for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown: $300,000 per wage-earning victim and $150,000 per non-wage-earner. As part of the settlement, the US agreed to send Iran two Airbus A300-600s, the first Western planes to be supplied to the country since 1980 (after the 1979 Iranian revolution). They remained Iran&#x27;s newest Western aircraft until some sanctions were lifted in 2017.

The US government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives, but never formally apologized or acknowledged wrongdoing. On 5July 1988, President Ronald Reagan expressed regret; when directly asked if he considered the statement an apology, Reagan replied, &quot;Yes.&quot; George H. W. Bush, then vice-president of the United States, commented on another occasion, in a televised recording, while addressing a group of Republican ethnic leaders during the 1988 presidential campaign: &quot;I will never apologize for the United States—I don&#x27;t care what the facts are... I&#x27;m not an apologize-for-America kind of guy.&quot; The quote, although unrelated to the downing of the Iranian airliner and not in any official capacity, has been attributed as such.

The incident overshadowed Iran–United States relations for many years. Former CIA analyst Kenneth M. Pollack wrote: &quot;The shoot-down of Iran Air Flight 655 was an accident, but that is not how it was seen in Tehran.&quot; Following the explosion of Pan Am Flight 103 five months later, the United States government initially blamed the PFLP-GC, a Palestinian militant group backed by Syria, with assumptions of assistance from Iran in retaliation for Flight 655. The distrust generated between the US and Iran as a result of the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 was a challenge in the development of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran Nuclear Deal, which was agreed to on 14 July 2015.

=== Criticism of US media coverage ===

In 1991, political scientist Robert Entman of George Washington University compared US media coverage of the incident with the similar shootdown of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union five years earlier by studying material from &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;. According to Entman, framing techniques were used to frame the Korean Airlines incident as sabotage, while framing the Iran Air incident as a tragic mistake, stating &quot;the angle taken by the US media emphasized the moral bankruptcy and guilt of the perpetrating nation. With Iran Air 655, the frame de-emphasised guilt and focused on the complex problems of operating military high technology.&quot; By &quot;de-emphasizing the agency and the victims and by the choice of graphics and adjectives, the news stories about the US downing of an Iranian plane called it a technical problem while the Soviet downing of a Korean jet was portrayed as a moral outrage.&quot; Entman included polling that appeared to show that the unbalanced coverage swayed public opinion against the Soviet Union and Iran. In July 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down in Ukraine, some commentators noted the discrepancy between the US official position and media coverage of the two similar incidents.

=== Post-tour of duty medals ===

Despite the downing of the plane, the crew of USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; were awarded Combat Action Ribbons for completion of their tours in a combat zone. The air warfare coordinator on duty received the Navy Commendation Medal, but &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 1990 that the awards were for his entire tour from 1984 to 1988 and not for his actions relating to the surface engagement with Iranian gunboats. Rogers was awarded the Legion of Merit &quot;for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer [...] from April 1987 to May 1989&quot;. The award was given for his service as the commanding officer of &quot;Vincennes&quot; from April 1987 to May 1989. The citation made no mention of the downing of Flight 655.

== In popular culture ==

The events of Flight 655 were featured in &quot;Mistaken Identity&quot;, a season 3 (2005) episode of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (called &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the US, and &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK).

<text>Starachowice is a city in southeastern Poland (historic Lesser Poland), with 49,513 inhabitants (31.12.2017). It is the capital of Starachowice County in the Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship. It is situated upon the River Kamienna, a tributary of the Vistula River, among hills and forests.

==History==

In the location of present-day Starachowice, a forge existed, which in the 16th century belonged to the Starzechowski family (most probably, the name of the town comes from this family). The oldest known mention of Starachowice comes from 1547. The settlement, which was built around the forge, belonged until 1817 to the Cistercians from Wąchock Abbey, located nearby. It was the monks who in 1789 initiated construction of a blast furnace (see also Old-Polish Industrial Region). In the meantime Polish bishop Bogusław Radoszewski founded the town of Wierzbnik in 1624, which was granted town rights by Polish King Sigismund III Vasa. Three annual fairs and three weekly markets were organized in the town, however it developed slowly, while Starachowice developed faster. Both settlements were administratively located in the Sandomierz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown.

In the Third Partition of Poland, in 1795, the area was annexed by Austria, in 1809 it passed to the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it passed to so-called Congress Poland in the Russian Partition of Poland. In 1815, the furnace was taken over by the government of Congress Poland, and in the following years, the industrial settlement of Starachowice emerged as main center of metallurgy. According to a plan devised by Stanisław Staszic, metal industry was developed along the Kamienna river, and the settlement of Starachowice was its center. As part of anti-Polish repressions following the unsuccessful Polish January Uprising, the Russian administration stripped Wierzbnik of its town rights in 1870, which were restored in 1916.

After Poland regained independence in 1918, the government in Warsaw decided to build an arms factory in Starachowice. On October 12, 1920, &quot;The Society of Starachowice Mining Company&quot; signed a contract with &quot;Main Office of Supplying the Army&quot;. Soon afterwards, works on construction of artillery ammunition factory began. &quot;Zakłady Starachowickie&quot; (&quot;Starachowice Works&quot;), which was an industrial complex including ammunition factory, artillery equipment factory and iron works, was main Poland’s producer of such materiel. It also manufactured the 75 mm Armata wz.02/26, 105 mm Armata wz. 29, 120 mm Armata wz. 78/09/31, Bofors 40 mm, and Bofors 37 mm guns, used by the Polish Army in 1939. The very town of Starachowice was not created until April 1, 1939, when the ancient town of Wierzbnik was merged with the settlement of &quot;Starachowice Fabryczne&quot; and the village of &quot;Starachowice Górne&quot;. At first, the new town was named &quot;Starachowice-Wierzbnik&quot;, and in 1952 the name was changed into Starachowice.

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the arms factory was evacuated eastwards on September 6, 1939. Later that same day, the suburb of Wanacja (present-day district of Starachowice) was the site of a battle between German and Polish troops, after which German troops committed a massacre of over 20 Polish civilians. On September 7, German troops entered Starachowice. On September 27, 1939, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe II&quot; entered the city to commit various crimes against Poles. Afterwards it was occupied by Germany and in 1940 the Germans carried out mass arrests of local Polish intelligentsia. Poles were used as forced labour in the local factory. During the Holocaust, the ghetto in Wierzbnik was liquidated on October 27, 1942, and many of its prisoners were sent to the death camp Treblinka. The remaining Jewish residents of Starachowice and Wierzbnik were sent to German labor camps in the vicinity. Those camps were liquidated in the summer of 1944. The remaining survivors were deported to Auschwitz where many were murdered by the Schutzstaffel. There was a munition plant there where Jewish slave labor was used. In 1944, during and following the Warsaw Uprising, the Germans deported thousands of Varsovians from the Dulag 121 camp in Pruszków, where they were initially imprisoned, to Starachowice. Those Poles were mainly old people, ill people and women with children. 10,000 Poles expelled from Warsaw stayed in the town, as of 1 November 1944.

During World War II, Starachowice was an important center of the Home Army, where units of Jan Piwnik and Antoni Heda operated. At least three local Polish boy scouts were killed by the Germans during the war.

After the war, the town prospered as an important industrial center. Besides &quot;Starachowice Works&quot;, truck producer FSC Star was opened in 1948. A Star truck was used as the basis for the first Popemobile for Pope John Paul II&#x27;s during his first visit to his home country as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church (1979). When capitalist system was reintroduced in 1989, the situation in Starachowice worsened, and unemployment grew drastically. The town currently has a special economy zone with lower tax rates to help the settlement of new industry.

<text>Skarżysko-Kamienna () is a city in northern Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship in south-central Poland by Kamienna river, to the north of Świętokrzyskie Mountains; one of the voivodship&#x27;s major cities. Prior to 1928, it bore the name of &quot;Kamienna&quot;; in less formal contexts usually only the first part of the name (&quot;Skarżysko&quot;) is used. It belongs to historic Polish province of Lesser Poland.

Skarżysko-Kamienna is an important railroad junction, with two main lines (Kraków – Warsaw and Sandomierz – Koluszki) crossing there.

==History==

The present-day districts of Łyżwy and Nowy Młyn were the locations of Paleolithic industrial settlements, which are now archaeological sites, part of the Rydno Archaeological Reserve, consisting of several hundred former Paleolithic sites stretching from Skarżysko-Kamienna to Wąchock. The sites were discovered in 1923–1925.

In 1173, the knights&#x27; congress gathered in Milica village (now the town&#x27;s district) led by Casimir II The Just. Within the Polish Kingdom, Skarżysko was a private village of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Radom County in the Sandomierz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. Around 1885 Kamienna became an important rail junction on the newly built Ivangorod-Dąbrowa Railway. The main line of the railway connecting Ivangorod (Dęblin) and Dąbrowa Górnicza ran through the town from north to south, and two branch lines to Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski and Koluszki radiated from the town east and west, respectively. This spurred the growth of Kamienna from a village into a sizeable town by 1920, when it had about 20 enterprises employing 1000 workers, as well as railway workshops employing an additional 1000 workers.

===Second Polish Republic===
In 1923, the commune of Kamienna was granted the status of a town. In 1922 the government of Poland decided to build an ammunition factory in Kamienna, to be called &quot;Państwowa Wytwornia Uzbrojenia Fabryka Amunicji&quot; (&quot;P.W.U. Fabryka Amunicji&quot;, &quot;National Armament Factory - Ammunition Plant&quot;) It began production in 1924 supplying munitions to the Polish Army. It employed 2760 workers in 1932, over 3000 in 1936, and over 4500 in 1939, becoming the principal employer in the town and driving its growth. The company still functions today under the name &quot;Zakłady Metalowe MESKO S.A.&quot;).

In 1928, town&#x27;s name was changed to Skarżysko-Kamienna. In 1937 the town had 19,700 inhabitants, among them 2,800 Jews (about 14% of the total).

===German occupation of Skarżysko-Kamienna (1939–1945)===

Following the September 1939 invasion of Poland by Germany, which started World War II, Skarżysko-Kamienna was under German occupation until liberated by the Soviet army in January 1945. The Germans controlled the ammunition factory to support their own war effort, and from 1940 it was controlled by the company Hugo Schneider Aktiengesellschaft (HASAG), which ran it as a subcontractor for the Wehrmacht. In 1940, the Germans carried out mass executions of Poles (360 people executed in February and 760 in June). The Polish underground resistance organization &quot;Orzeł Biały&quot; (&quot;White Eagle&quot;) was organized in the town. Among its members were local monks, and a weapons depot used by Polish partisans was located in the local monastery. Several monks were arrested and murdered by the Germans in the massacre committed in February 1940, while one managed to escape arrest.

The ghetto for the town&#x27;s Jewish population was established by the Germans in April or May 1941. Between August 1942 and summer of 1943 Jews from the Radom district were brought to three camps near the munitions factory to work the factory. According to German records, of the total 17,210 brought in with 58 transports, 6,408 managed to survive long enough to be evacuated to other camps when the Germans closed the factory in 1944. The ghetto was liquidated in October 1942, with some inhabitants judged fit for work moved to the factory labour camps (about 500 out of 3000), and the rest were transported to Treblinka. In the major monograph on the subject estimated that despite the incompleteness of German records which likely underestimate the number of inmates, about 25,000 Jewish inmates were brought to the camp and 7,000 were evacuated from it; about 18,000 died there. The secret Polish Council to Aid Jews &quot;Żegota&quot;, established by the Polish resistance movement, operated in the town. There are several known cases of Poles, who were either executed on sight or imprisoned in the local prison and deported to concentration camps for rescuing and aiding Jews.

In April 1942, the Germans founded the Stalag 380 prisoner-of-war camp, which several months later was relocated to Oppdal and Dombås in German-occupied Norway.

At least nine Boy Scouts and two Girl Scouts from the town were murdered by the Germans during the occupation (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). The monk who managed to avoid capture by the Germans in 1940, died in the Soviet bombing of the town in 1945.

===From 1945 to present===
On January 18, 1945 the town was liberated and restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. About a dozen Jewish survivors returned to Skarżysko-Kamienna in the winter of 1945-1946 to retrieve Jewish property. Soon afterwards, in February 1946, five of them were murdered for profit by a small group of local criminals. The murderers, among them the head of the Soviet-installed town police and another communist policeman, were put on trial in Łodź. Three of them received the death penalty. The remaining Jews left Poland, except for Dr. Zundel Kahanel and his wife Bima who spent the rest of their lives in the city.
Meanwhile, in 1948 the leading HASAG managers were tried in Leipzig in the Soviet occupation zone in Germany. Of the 25 tried, 4 were sentenced to death, 2 to life in prison, and 18 to terms between one and five years.

In 1969, The White Eagle Museum was established. In 1984, town limits were expanded by including the neighboring settlements of Łyżwy and Nowy Młyn as new districts. In 1999, Skarżysko County was established as a result of the Local Government Reorganization Act (1998).

<text>Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski (), often referred to as Ostrowiec, is a city in southeastern Poland, in the historical region of Lesser Poland, with 66,258 residents (as of 2021). The town is one of the historic centers of Polish industry and metallurgy, and was part of the Old-Polish Industrial Region, the oldest industrial basin of the country.

Ostrowiec is the capital city of Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski County, part of Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship (since 1999), previously it belonged to Kielce Voivodeship (1975–1998). It received a town charter in 1613.

Ostrowiec lies on the Kamienna river. Its northern districts are located in the Iłża Foothills, while the southern part belongs to the Opatów Upland. The Świętokrzyskie Mountains lie a few kilometers away, southwest of Ostrowiec. There are two interesting places near Ostrowiec: the archaeological reserve at Krzemionki (a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Historic Monument of Poland) and dinosaur park in Bałtów.

Ostrowiec is located at the intersection of National Road No. 9 (part of European route E371), and local roads 751, 754, 755. Furthermore, since 1884 the town has had a rail connection, along electrified rail line No. 25, which goes from Łódź Kaliska to Dębica. In the 1960s, the Polish government planned construction of a rail line from Kielce to Lublin via Ostrowiec. The area of the town is 46 km2, and it is divided into 20 osiedla.

== History ==
===Early history===

The oldest testimonies of human habitation date back to the Stone Age (ca 4000 BC). At that time, there were nomadic tribes belonging to, among others, the Lengyel and Globular Amphora cultures. They came here from Danube river region.

The earliest documents about Ostrowiec village, that gave beginning to the contemporary Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski come from 14th century. At that time the village was called Ostrow, and was located on the right bank of the Kamienna. In the early 16th century, a local nobleman Kacper Maciejewski tried to establish here a town, but failed to do so. In 1564 town charter was granted to the settlement of Denków (also called Wielki Michów), which is now one of the Ostrowiec districts. Denków was a private town, administratively located in the Sandomierz County in the Sandomierz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown.

The city itself, at that time part of Sandomierz Voivodeship, was built from scratch in 1597 by Jakub Gawroński of Rawa coat of arms on the left bank of the Kamienna river, situated in the Vistula river basin. It received town privileges in 1613. It became a property of Janusz Ostrogski, a statesman and one of the richest magnates of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Later it belonged to many Polish aristocratic families: Tarnowski family, Czartoryski family, Lubomirski family, Radziwiłł family, Zasławski family, Sanguszko family, Wielopolski family, Dobrzański family, Łubieński family.

===Industrialization===

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Ostrowiec emerged as a main center of Polish industry. Following the idea of Stanisław Staszic, who promoted industrialization of the Kamienna river valley, based on local deposits of coal and iron ore, numerous plants were opened in the area. In 1837 - 1839, the Klimkiewicz Steelworks was opened (named after its founder Antoni Klimkiewicz), which later came to be known as the Ostrowiec Works (Zaklady Ostrowieckie). The plant became the second largest in Congress Poland, and in its vicinity, various enterprises were opened, together with workers establishment.

Ostrowiec was one of main centers of the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907). On 27 December 1905 the so-called Ostrowiec Republic was established, and for two weeks, the town and the county were ruled by the Polish Socialist Party, headed by Ignacy Boerner. The Republic was ended after the arrival of two infantry regiments of the Imperial Russian Army. The Ostrowiec Works was severely damaged during World War I, and on 3 November 1918 newly established Polish authorities took control over Ostrowiec. In the Second Polish Republic Ostrowiec developed, due to its location in Central Industrial Area. The town belonged to Opatow County, and before World War II its population was app. 30,000. In 1937 it was officially named Ostrowiec Swietokrzyski. Earlier on, the names Ostrowiec Kielecki and Ostrowiec nad Kamienna had been used.

===World War II===

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the Wehrmacht captured the town on 8 September 1939. Afterwards it was occupied by Germany and included within the Radom District of the General Government, formed of German-occupied central Poland. In 1940 the Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles as part of the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;. Poles arrested in March were either deported to Nazi concentration camps or massacred in Góry Wysokie, while those arrested in June were imprisoned and tortured in Skarżysko-Kamienna and then murdered in a forest near Skarżysko-Kamienna. Germans carried out several executions and massacres in the town. On 30 September 1942, 29 Poles, including merchants, teachers and local officials, were hanged at the Market Square. In 1944, the Germans poured corrosive substances into their mass grave in attempt to cover up the crime. Most of the town&#x27;s Jewish community of app. 11,000 was murdered in the Holocaust in 1943–1944.

Ostrowiec was a lively centre of the Polish resistance movement. There was underground weapons production. Independent underground Polish press printed in nearby Sandomierz was distributed in Ostrowiec since 1940. A very significant action carried out by the local Polish underground was the kidnapping of the German city commissioner Bruno Motschall. In 1943, Motschall was kidnapped in broad daylight in the town center by a Home Army unit in his own car. The Poles fled towards the nearby village of Chmielów. A German pursuit group of 60 people followed the car. Because of a car defect, the kidnappers were caught up in Chmielów, where a shootout ensued, which resulted in three Poles being killed. German troops withdraw westwards on 16 January 1945.

===Recent period===
Ostrowiec continued its development in the postwar period. In 1954, several villages were annexed, including Denków, which itself had once been a town. In the 1970s, a new metallurgical plant was opened. In the 1990s, the metallurgical industry experienced a big crisis. The steel plant was bought then by Spanish CELSA Group. The city also accepted Ukrainian athletes after the Russian invasion.

<text>Koło () is a town on the Warta River in central Poland with 23,101 inhabitants (2006). It is situated in the Greater Poland Voivodship and it is the capital of Koło County.

== History ==

Koło is one of the oldest towns in Poland. It was granted town status in 1362 by King Casimir III. It was situated in a safe place near the royal castle, on the island in the branches of the Warta River; the town had no walls but only two gates. It was a royal city and the seat of a land county (&quot;starostwo niegrodowe&quot;).[p. 16–18]

In 1410 Koło was a gathering place of the Greater Poland nobility, which called for a war with the Teutonic Order (see Battle of Grunwald). In 1452 the Royal Castle in Koło was the place of meeting between King Casimir the Jagiellonian and the representatives of the Prussian Union (see: the Thirteen Years&#x27; War).
From the early 15th century until 1716, Koło was the meeting place of the Provincial Parliament called &quot;Sejmik Generalny&quot; for the Greater Poland region, comprising the Poznań Voivodship, Kalisz, Sieradz, Łęczyca, Brześć Kujawski and Inowrocław Voivodeships. The town evolved into a regional hub of trade and crafts especially in metals and textiles, and as a centre of pottery. In 1571 a contract was drafted with regard to the status of the Jews in Koło, in which the city&#x27;s Christians have undertaken to provide protection to the Jews, in return for which the Jews were required pay a special annual municipal tax.

Koło was destroyed twice, once in 1622 by the Lisowski forces, and in 1655 by the Swedes; the economy managed to revive only at the end of the 17th century. Until 1793 Koło belonged to Konin County of the Kalisz Voivodeship of the Greater Poland Province. The 1st Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in the town.
Following the Second Partition of Poland, in the years 1793-1806 it was occupied by Prussia, but during the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794 it was temporarily liberated by the insurgents. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. After the duchy&#x27;s dissolution in 1815, it formed part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In 1826, Fryderyk Chopin travelled through the town.

===20th century===

After the return of Poland&#x27;s sovereignty at the end of World War I, Koło was assigned to Łódź Voivodeship. A new railway line opened in 1921 from Kutno to Strzałkowo via Koło. According to the 1921 census, the population was 58.7% Polish and 40.2% Jewish.

On September 2, 1939, during Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland, the Luftwaffe bombed a civilian evacuation train from Krotoszyn, killing almost 250 civilians. The Germans captured Koło on September 18, 1939. On September 19, Jewish males over the age of 14 were rounded up and sent to forced labour. The Jewish synagogue was set on fire the following day. Many Poles were arrested and imprisoned in the local prison, and afterwards murdered in Rzuchów. On November 11, 1939, 80 people, who had previously been imprisoned in Koło, were murdered there by the German police. In November 1939, Poles from Koło were also murdered in other places, including Bugaj, Chełmno nad Nerem, Konin.

The first Aktion, conducted by Wehrmacht soldiers and gendarmes, took place in December 1939, in which 100 Jews were executed. In June 1940 the Germans expelled 514 Poles, merchants and craftsmen with entire families, mostly to the General Government, while some were deported to forced labour to Germany, and their houses, workshops and shops were handed over to German colonists in accordance to the Nazi &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. In December 1940, the Jews were rounded up in a ghetto, which was liquidated the following year, in December 1941. The remaining Jews were deported to Chełmno extermination camp, where they were killed in gas vans and buried in mass graves. Koło remained a transfer point for Jews deported to Łódź, and Nazi officials, including Heinrich Himmler, visited the town.

Under German occupation, the town was renamed to &quot;Wartbrücken&quot; in 1940, and then to &quot;Warthbrücken&quot; in 1941 (which translates to &quot;bridge on Warta river&quot;).

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively part of the Konin Voivodship.

<text>Turek is a town in central Poland with 31,282 inhabitants . It is the capital of Turek County in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. It is located in the Sieradz Land.

==History==

Turek is first mentioned in the historical record 1136, when it was listed as belonging to the archbishops of Gniezno. It received its town rights in 1341. It was a private church town, administratively located in the Sieradz County in the Sieradz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

Turek was annexed by Prussia in 1793 in the Second Partition of Poland, regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, and included within so-called Congress Poland in 1815, soon forcibly integrated with the Russian Empire. It was then capital of a district within the Kalisz Governorate. In 1826, Fryderyk Chopin travelled through the town. During the January Uprising, it was the site of clashes between Polish insurgents and Russian troops on August 20 and December 28, 1863. Following the end of the First World War in 1918, Turek became part of the Second Polish Republic as the country regained independence.

With the German invasion of Poland and the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Turek was occupied by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and annexed by Nazi Germany. It was administered as part of the county or district (&quot;kreis&quot;) of Turek within newly formed province of Reichsgau Wartheland. The Polish population was subjected to expulsions, confiscation of property, deportations to Nazi concentration camps and murder (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). In autumn of 1939, the &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; carried out a number of executions of Poles at the local market. Teachers from Turek were among Polish teachers murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp. The first expulsion of 160 Poles was carried out in December 1939, and the expellees&#x27; shops, workshops and houses were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. A transit camp for Poles expelled from the region was operated in the town. During the German occupation, the nearly 3,000 Jews in Turek were brutalized, forced into an overcrowded ghetto in 1940, starved, and robbed of all their possessions. In 1941, some men were sent to forced labour camps near Poznań, but the majority of Turek&#x27;s Jews were sent to a rural ghetto in Kowale Pańskie. In July 1942, most of them were sent to the Chełmno extermination camp where they were gassed immediately. Only around 30 Turek Jews survived the war.

With the arrival of the Red Army in 1945 and the end of the war, Turek was integrated into the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Konin Voivodeship.

<text>Konin () is a city in central Poland, on the Warta River. It is the capital of Konin County and is located within the Greater Poland Voivodeship. Prior to 1999, it was the capital of the Konin Voivodeship. In 2021 the population of the city was 71,427, making it the fourth-largest city in Greater Poland after Poznań, Kalisz and Piła.

== History ==

===Prehistory===
The earliest evidence of human habitation in Konin has been dated to the Paleolithic Era. On the dunes near the Warta, various ancient flint tools and implements have been found, among them being knives, burins, and tanged points. These earliest artifacts are of the Swiderian culture (&quot;Kultura Świderska&quot;) of 9000–8000 BC.

===Ancient times===

A permanent settlement arose along the Amber Road, which led from the Roman Empire to the Baltic Sea, traversing the area of present-day Konin. A map drawn by Ptolemy identified the settlement as &quot;Setidava&quot; (or &quot;Getidava&quot;), a probable spot to wade across the Warta and containing an emporium of some importance to merchants travelling along the route. The settlement&#x27;s primary burial ground, situated on the dunes west of the centre of today&#x27;s Konin, dates back to the Przeworsk culture (&quot;Kultura Przeworska&quot;) of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.

===Middle Ages===

Toward the end of the early Middle Ages, Gród Kaszuba was the most significant of the fortified settlements near present-day Konin. Inhabited from the 10th through 12th centuries, Gród Kaszuba was situated on the meadows near the Warta. Its abandonment was likely a consequence of floods which damaged its fortifications. The remains of Gród Kaszuba are visible on the south bank of the river.

During the 12th and 13th centuries, in the high to late Middle Ages, a complex of settlements was centred on the location of today&#x27;s &quot;Stare Miasto&quot;, where there existed a large settlement named Konin and a market place and a church built of sandstone. (The name &quot;Stare Miasto&quot; first appeared in use later, after Konin had been reestablished elsewhere.) What remains from that time is SS Peter and Paul&#x27;s Parish Church, with its magnificent carved portal and a solar clock on the south wall, perhaps the oldest solar clock in Greater Poland. In 1331, the settlement was plundered and burnt by the Teutonic Knights. What remained was soon abandoned and the town of Konin was reestablished, six kilometres () to the northeast, in the more defensible spot where the Old Town of Konin is situated today. 

Since the 13th century, Konin has been situated on the marshy grounds of an island within a ford of the Warta River. The oldest available written work confirming the location of the town is associated with Gosław, the chief officer of a group of settlers, and was recorded in 1293. The town may have been chartered by the Duke of Greater Poland, Przemysł II, who visited Konin in 1284 and 1292. At that time, the town&#x27;s north–south axis equalled 430 meters, while its east–west axis equalled 210 meters. Also, the town&#x27;s area was eight hectares, and its circumference was 1100 meters. By the standards of the time, Konin was a town of medium size.

Konin&#x27;s significance grew during the 14th century. Records from that era indicate that Konin possessed a &quot;Castellan&quot;, an office of significance in feudal Poland, and one which only the oldest towns in the country were granted. At approximately the midpoint of the century, Konin became the judicial seat of the Kalisz Voivodeship and functioned under the authority of a &quot;Starost&quot;. There may have also been a school in Konin at the time, as a student from Konin is listed in a 14th-century record of the Charles University in Prague.

The second half of the 14th century and the entire 15th are believed to have been a period of rapid development for Konin. During the reign of the Polish King Casimir III the Great (1310–1370), a king&#x27;s castle was erected in Konin and the town was encircled with walls and a moat, marking the beginning of Konin as a king&#x27;s town Later, King Władysław II Jagiełło (1351/52 - 1434) was a guest of Konin, visiting in the years of 1403, 1425, and 1433. (Władysław engineered a historic debilitation of the political and military power of the Teutonic Knights by means of his Polish-Lithuanian victory at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410.) His last stay at Konin, in 1433, was his longest. Throughout that year&#x27;s summer, he resided in the town&#x27;s castle, obtaining reports on a Polish retaliatory strike against the Knights.

In 1458, during the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–66) against the Teutonic Order, there was a call for military recruitment throughout Poland. Every Polish town was bound to put up a number of soldiers, the number of which was a sign of the size and power of a given town. With regard to Konin, it was 15 infantrymen; by comparison, Poznań, the capital of Greater Poland, was bound to put up 60, while Kalisz, nearby Słupca and Kłodawa, and Koło were to provide 30, 20, 20, and 15 men, respectively. These quantities suggest that Konin was still a town of medium size. Notwithstanding, the town continued its development of handicraft trades and enlarged the area of its Starosty District. In 1425, Konin was granted a charter to conduct two fairs each year.

===Renaissance===

The 16th century, the period of Poland&#x27;s golden age, was a time of significant economic, political, military, cultural, and territorial growth. In 1504, the village of Kurów, located on the river bank opposite the main body of Konin, was incorporated into the town. Furthermore, a description of the town, written in 1557, lists a brickyard and a mill as well as eight butchers, 14 bakers, 21 shoemakers, and four fishermen. However, Konin may have been one of the smaller towns of the time in eastern Greater Poland, based on its &quot;Szos&quot;, the tax assessed on its earnings and the possessions of its townspeople. Konin was obliged to pay 32 zlotych, while Poznań (the capital of Greater Poland) was assessed 1400 zlotych; Kalisz, 230; nearby Słupca, 96; and both Koło and Pyzdry, 64.

Concerning religious matters and the Reformation, the starost of Konin, Jakub Ostroróg, was a notable supporter of the Protestants, and a local parish-priest, Stanisław Lutomirski, played a role in the Reformation in the region surrounding Konin.

===17th century===
During the 17th century, epidemics and war greatly afflicted Konin. A plague of three years&#x27; length (1628-1631) decimated the town&#x27;s population. Subsequent efforts to revitalize Konin included King Władysław IV&#x27;s 1646 proclamation, confirming the town&#x27;s right to conduct two fairs annually and promoting participation in those events by offering military protection to merchants who attended them, and a 1652 edict of the Starost, licensing the Scottish community of Konin to erect breweries. Thereafter, the town was invaded and occupied by the Swedish Army in 1656 during the Second Northern War (The Deluge), suffering extensive damage (see &quot;Castles&quot; and &quot;Ancient town walls&quot;) and a reduction in the number of its houses, from 127 prior to the war to 25 in 1659. By war&#x27;s end, the town&#x27;s population had been reduced to not more than 200 persons. Another plague occurred shortly afterwards, in 1662.

===18th century===

The 18th century began with the turmoil of the Great Northern War, during which Konin was so severely devastated, in 1707, that its restoration required the remainder of the century to complete. The second half of the century was a time of advanced crisis for the nation, as an irreversible decline of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth culminated in the Partitions of Poland and the loss of national independence. Poland&#x27;s territory was occupied and divided among three bordering countries - Russia, Prussia, and Austria - in three stages, occurring in the years of 1772, 1793 and 1795.

As a consequence of the second partition, Konin was incorporated into Prussia, ending Konin&#x27;s status as a royal town. At the time, the town&#x27;s population was 780, with 165 houses, of which only one was made of brick. Inhabitants earned their living in agriculture and handicrafts. Among craftsmen, there were 22 shoemakers, 13 potters, and eight furriers. Eight fairs took place each year, together with a round-up of cattle. Poles, Jews, Germans and Scots were the town&#x27;s four main ethnic groups. In 1794, Konin joined the first Polish insurrection, the Kościuszko Uprising; the act of joining is recorded in the town&#x27;s books of that period. Polish insurgents also took control of the town multiple times - e.g., in September 1794, when the town was entered by the soldiers of the corps of Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, the namesake of the Polish national anthem - the so-called &quot;Dąbrowski&#x27;s Mazurka&quot;. In 1796, the town was damaged by fire.

===19th century===
The 19th century began with the general, European disorder of the Napoleonic Wars, which neither eastern Greater Poland nor Konin escaped. At the start of the century, the Duchy of Warsaw was created as a Polish formally independent state, &quot;de facto&quot; dependent upon Napoleon I Bonaparte. The Napoleonic Wars gave Poles hope of regaining national independence, and they strongly supported Napoleon. On November 9, 1806, Poles took control of Konin and quickly organized a new, town government. The following year, the town was formally incorporated into the Duchy of Warsaw.
The subsequent collapse of the Napoleonic Empire resulted in the establishment of a new order in Europe, as well as within the Polish territories, including Konin. The Congress of Vienna, assembled in 1814–1815 to arrange political changes on the continent, awarded Russia the majority of territories formerly held by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Konin itself was incorporated into Russia as a part of Congress Poland (formally the &quot;Kingdom of Poland&quot;), a pseudo-autonomous region that was a Russian dependency and which recognized the tzar as its ruler. The town was also designated as the capital of a sector within the Kalisz Governorate; the sector encompassed two counties, Konin County and Pyzdry County. From an administrative standpoint, Konin&#x27;s sector constituted the westernmost territory of the Russian state.

The November Uprising erupted in 1830. Although Konin was not directly involved in this Polish uprising, as with other Polish cities and towns it suffered the political and cultural consequences of its failure. Those consequences included the denial of higher offices to Poles, the elimination of Polish as the official language, and the systematic russification of the primary and secondary schools.

The January Uprising of 1863 had a greater effect on Konin than had the 1830 rebellion. As many as several dozen battles and skirmishes took place in and near Konin, to which many present-day monuments attest.

From 1815 onwards, trade and handicraft activities increased substantially in Konin. A description of the town, from 1820, states that among the 2,456 inhabitants, there were 161 craftsmen, ten merchants, and 42 peasants. During the course of the century the population of Konin increased steadily, rising from 4,195 people in 1850 to 7,391 in 1896. In comparison, nearby Koło had an 1896 population of 8,800 inhabitants, while Turek&#x27;s population that same year was 9,900. However, while nearby Łódź was becoming one of the most significant textile industrial centres in the world, only 12 cloth workshops and small factories existed in Konin in 1820.

During the 1830s, a general renewal of the town led to the construction of new streets and squares. Also, building lots were developed for industrial expansion, and dilapidated buildings were demolished.

By the end of the century, there were two factories that produced machines and special tools for agriculture - the larger of them belonged to L. Reymond, a citizen of Switzerland, who settled permanently in Konin. His factory was equipped with a 12 horse-power steam engine and a cast iron foundry. Apart from these enterprises, the town held 18 windmills, four tanneries, four workshops producing soap, three vinegar factories, two small factories producing boilers, two breweries, two oil-mills, a sparkling water factory, and a distillery.

===20th century===
For Konin, the early 20th century was a period of rapid development in the fields of culture, education, and social life. The Musical Society of Kalisz (&quot;Towarzystwo Muzyczne w Kaliszu&quot;) had as many as 72 members in Konin, and Konin&#x27;s Jewish Library was one of the finest within the Gubernya of Kalisz, with a number of books and a general readership that significantly exceeded similar libraries in Kalisz, a much larger urban area. Also, a branch of the Rowing Club of Kalisz (&quot;Kaliskie Towarzystwo Wioślarskie&quot;) was founded in Konin in 1908 and, by 1914, had 95 members. Its building, displaying the club&#x27;s coat of arms, still stands in Old Konin, in Zofii Urbanowskiej Street.

Workers&#x27; associations were also established in Konin. In 1905, when significant strikes occurred in Polish industrial centres such as Warsaw and Łódź, there were some minor strikes and turmoil in Konin as well.

A branch of the Polish gymnastic society &quot;Sokół&quot;, was founded in Konin. A quasi-military association, its objective was to maintain the fitness of teenagers, to improve their health, and to provide for readily trainable military recruits in the event of a possible national uprising or a defence need. Similar Jewish and German associations also existed.

After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, battles between Russian and German troops occurred near Konin. Ultimately, the city came under German occupation and deteriorated. In November 1918, when Poland regained independence, the German &quot;Landsturm&quot; opened fire on members of the Polish Military Organisation and Polish scouts and students, who tried to liberate the city. The Germans also threw grenades at local inhabitants who gathered at the local Market Square, killing six people and wounding many. Nevertheless, Konin was soon reintegrated with the reborn Polish state. The economic situation of the town did not improve. Living conditions of residents were still miserable, exacerbated by the lack of functioning water distribution and sewer systems. The subsequent inter-war economic crisis was harsh, and conditions did not begin to improve until the &quot;désenclavement&quot; of the town, attributable to the opening of a major railway, between Poznań and Warsaw, and the construction of a canal to Gopło Lake. Jews represented 30% of Konin&#x27;s population in the 1930s. 

During the Second World War, Konin was part of the land annexed by Nazi Germany (&quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot;). During the German occupation, mass murders of Poles were committed by the Germans at the local Jewish cemetery in November 1939 and in the spring of 1940, in which 94 people were killed, some as part of the German &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; and some as punishment for their involvement in the defense of Poland during the German invasion of Poland of September 1939. The Germans established and operated a Nazi prison in the city, and two forced labour camps for Jews. Poles were also subjected to expulsions to the so-called General Government, carried out in late 1939 and in 1940, which especially pertained to owners of more well-kept houses, shops and workshops, which were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. Three Polish men from Konin were also murdered by the Soviets in the large Katyn massacre committed in April–May 1940. In the town&#x27;s surrounding forests, the Nazis carried out mass executions of Jews, 95% of which were killed or sent to concentration camps. In August 1943, the Jews at the labour camp at Konin, led by Rabbi Joshua Moshe Aaronson, burned down the huts in the camp and tried to escape. Almost all of them were killed.

==Jewish community of Konin==

The first written evidence of Jews settling in Konin dates to 1397. In the 15th century, 180 Jews were counted in the city. Over the course of the 17th century, the number of Jews in the city shrank as a result of fires, plagues, and restrictions upon Jewish residency. Administratively, the Jews of Konin were subordinate to the larger community in nearby Kalisz until the end of the 18th century.

A wooden synagogue was built in 1763–1766. The current standing building was built in 1829. The first rabbi in Konin was Rabbi Amsterdam, between 1810 and 1849.

Between the two world wars, some 3,000 Jews lived in the city, constituting roughly a quarter of its residents. In 1918, the first Jewish gymnasium was established. The community had a beit midrash, mikvaot, synagogues, a few prayer halls (such as &quot;Hevra Tehilim&quot;), active youth movements, a library, a Jewish elementary school and a Jewish high school. During this period, movements such as Agudat Yisrael, Beitar, and other Zionist parties, and the Bund were active there. The majority of Jews in Konin were Mitnagdim, though two small communities of Hasidim lived within the Konin Jewish community, mostly adherents of Gerer Hasidism, with a small group of Aleksander Hasidim.

The Germans occupied Konin in September 1939 and shortly after the area was incorporated into the Reich as part of the Warthegau. In late 1939, about 1000 of the town&#x27;s Jews were deported to a settlement near Radom. The Germans confined the remainder of the Jews to a ghetto in 1940 and their former residences were given to German officials and ethnic Germans who came from the east. Later in the year, groups of Konin&#x27;s Jews were deported to other ghettos, being allowed to take only a few items with them. By the end of 1940, almost all had been deported. In November 1941, some Konin Jews were part of the 3000 Jews murdered by the German SS in the forests of Kaziemesh (Kleczew), north of the city. Out of 6000 Jewish people living in the city before the German occupation perhaps 200 survived the war and 46 returned to Konin. None of them continued living in Konin due to the hostility of the non-Jewish population.

The town survivors published, in 1968, an extensive Yizkor (memorial) book (803 pages) in memory of the flourishing Jewish community. The book was written in Yiddish, Hebrew and English.

A descendant of Konin Jews, Theo Richmond, wrote &quot;Konin: A Quest&quot;, the most extensive history of Jewish life in the town to appear in English. The book won the Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize in 1996.

==Castles==

The 14th-century castle, built of brick with some details made of sandstone (probably taken from the nearby quarry of Brzeźno village), had a perimeter in the shape of a regular quadrangle. The main buildings were massive, with an octagonal watchtower in the southeast corner of the compound and a kind of great hall on its western side. The castle was also encircled with a double wall and a moat. During the Deluge of the 17th century, it was partially damaged by the Swedish army and abandoned to slow decay. The derelict structure was demolished during the 19th century, with its larger sections being removed about 1844–1855). Today, there are no remains of the castle itself. Castle Square (&quot;Plac Zamkowy&quot;) is located in approximately the spot where the castle had stood. Another castle, erected during the 15th century in the former Gosławice village, now Konin&#x27;s Gosławice district, was restored during the 1980s.

==Ancient town walls==
The construction of the town walls started, as in the case of the castle, in the second half of the 14th century. They encircled the town as a defence line, especially on the settlement&#x27;s southern and eastern sides and partially on the western. The line of walls, however, never entirely formed a closed circuit, as the Warta River and its nearby marshy grounds, bogs, earthworks, and retrenchments provided adequate protection in the gaps. On the north side of town, the Toruńska Gatehouse (&quot;Brama Toruńska&quot;) sat just in front of the river crossing, while the south side was guarded from the Kaliska Gatehouse (&quot;Brama Kaliska&quot;); both gatehouses were named for towns that were primary destinations for merchants travelling through Konin.

The walls were reinforced by a series of rectangular towers that projected from the walls, creating a bastion-like structure. The towers themselves, each consisting of three walls, were open to the side that faced the town. These fortifications were seriously damaged during the Deluge, especially in the 1656 siege of Konin. They were never repaired afterwards, so at the turn of the 18th century the town&#x27;s authorities chose to have them deconstructed or demolished if necessary. Their last conspicuous elements were removed sometime after 1816, and today there are no remains.

== Architectural landmarks ==
Konin County (&quot;Powiat Koniński&quot;) contains examples of the following architectural forms: Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist, Baroque, and Rococo; 18th century Classicism; 19th century Neo-Gothic, Neoromanesque, Neoclassicism, and Eclecticism; and 20th century Modernism, Nazi architecture, Socialist Realism, and Postmodernism. Also near Konin are the remains of the reinforced concrete bunkers employed by Poland&#x27;s &quot;Armia Poznań&quot; during World War II.

Architecturally, the city of Konin is divided into two historical parts - Old Town (&quot;Stary Konin&quot;), situated on the south bank of the Warta; and New Konin (&quot;Nowy Konin&quot;), spreading northward from the river and developed primarily after 1945.
*Romanesque
** The Stone Signpost of Konin is the oldest European signpost beyond the boundaries of the Roman Empire. Made of local sandstone from the quarry near Brzeźno, it was commissioned in 1151 AD by either Duke Piotr Włost Włostowicz or Piotr Stary Wszeborowic. Containing Romanesque inscriptions, some scholars hypothesize that the stone itself was originally a Celtic sculpture.
** St Bartholomew&#x27;s parish church was rebuilt in the second half of the 14th century, but its Romanesque features are still visible in the external walls, particularly the north wall. The features include dressed stones made of sandstone and a massive stone cross built into the wall.

*Gothic
** St Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish Church is Konin&#x27;s most notable example of Gothic architecture and art. It contains a gothic net and vault inside the church and stained glass in the chancel.
** St Andrew&#x27;s Church, in Konin&#x27;s Gosławice district, is a rural Gothic church with an unusual Greek cross. The building also contains a rare fan vault. Sandstone bosses and other details are richly carved. The external walls are embellished with a number of coats of arms.
** The 15th-century mediaeval castle in Gosławice, currently a regional museum, was built at the direction of Poznań&#x27;s Bishop Andrzej Łaskarz in 1418–1426. It was designed to be defended with firearms. Gosławice contains a rare collection of historical buildings, with its ancient village, Gothic church, mediaeval castle, and old Polish manor.
*Renaissance
** On the grounds of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church is the Late Renaissance chapel of Jan Zemełko (Zemelius), a local physician, Renaissance man, and well-known member of the middle class in Konin and Kalisz.
** The former home of Jan Zemełko, on the &quot;Plac Wolności&quot;, has been refurbished many times since Zemełko&#x27;s era, but the main hall still contains the original barrel vault. At the ground floor level, the walls are exceedingly thick (1 to 2 m).
*Mannerism
** The Manneristic tombstone of Stanisław Przyjemski is located at the north wall of the main nave of St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish Church.
** Manneristic wooden stalls, with inlaid work, are located in the Chapel of Jan Zemełko (Zemelius).

*Baroque
** St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish Church contains many Baroque altars, epitaphs, and stalls, and a Late Baroque wall crucifix hangs in the porch. The Late Baroque church organ dates from the 18th century.
** The Baroque monastery and church building at St. Mary Magdalene&#x27;s Church of Reformed Franciscans were built in 1631.
*Rococo
** At St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish Church, Rococo elements are found in the wall crucifix above the entrance to the porch at the north wall of the main nave and in the main altar at the Chapel of Jan Zemełko.

*Classicism
** The Town Hall, built at the beginning of the 19th century, has a façade encompassing four, tall Toscany Columns bearing a large pediment. Above the pediment is a small tower with a clock and a tall flagstaff from which the official flag of Konin is hung on local and state holidays.
** Old Town contains many Classicist tenement houses as well as a former butcher&#x27;s shop in the same style, near the Town Hall.
** The Municipal Council Building, near the &quot;Plac Wolności&quot;, is of the Classicist style.
** The Presbytery of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Ghost is a Classicist manor house, situated in the small garden at the center of the Old Town.
*Neo-Gothic (19th and 20th centuries)
** St Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish Church has a Neo-Gothic main altar made of wood, with many Neo-Gothic statues decorating it.
** St Andrew&#x27;s Church, in the Gosławice District, originally was built in the Gothic style. It was refurbished in the Neo-Gothic manner. Its central turret and the façades of its chapels were built in the 19th century.
*Eclecticism (19th and 20th centuries)
** The Lutheran Church of the Holy Ghost, constructed in 1856 and rebuilt in 1901-1915 and 1981–1985, is a representation of Eclecticism. Built when Konin was under the control of the Russian Empire, it is somewhat reminiscent of the style of Russian Orthodox churches. Constructed of dark brick, its massive main tower is covered with spires and many decorative details.
** St. Adalbert&#x27;s Church, in the Morzysław District, was built in the 18th century on the site of an earlier wooden church and its churchyard. It was completely refurbished, enlarged, and altered at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in an impressive large temple, with a tall main tower topped by a high spire. This church, also, shows the slight influence of Russian Orthodox architecture.
** Many tenement houses in Old Town have eclectic façades displaying the features of many different architectural manners and styles.
** Other examples of Eclecticism in Konin are found in the Jewish buildings, including the Konin Synagogue, the ritual baths, and the Talmudic schoolhouse. These buildings were constructed in the 19th century, and the synagogue is considered to be one of the most beautiful buildings of its kind in Greater Poland. Erected in 1832, it was enlarged and renovated in 1883. Its southern façade refers to the history of the Ashkenazi Jews and comprises a mix of architectural styles, with a predominance of the Moorish and Neo-Gothic styles. The north façade is more composed and unencumbered, referring mainly to Classicism, as in its huge pediment.
** The Romani Gypsy palaces of ulica Stodolniana and ulica Europejska, in the Old Town, exhibit impressive onion domes and sculptures shaped like miniature, richly embellished mediaeval castles. Built mainly in the 1980s and 1990s, they represent a unique element within the city&#x27;s residential districts.
*Modernism: Pre-War (1920–19390
** Ulica Szarych Szeregów 1 is an impressive renovated tenement house with a distinguished façade and an infamous history. Built in the 1930s by a local MP, it housed the World War II offices of the Nazi Gestapo, who tortured prisoners there. After 1945, the building was occupied by the Communist secret state police, the &quot;Urząd Bezpieczeństwa&quot;. The building now houses private apartments.
** Ulica 3 Maja 48 is a fine example of pre-war Modernism. The Guild of Handicrafts (&quot;Cech Rzemiosł Różnych&quot;) is situated there, as are various shops.
*Modernism: Post-War (1945-1960s)
** The town&#x27;s library (&quot;Miejska Biblioteka Publiczna / MBP&quot;), at ulica Dworcowa, is a bulky, cube-shaped Modernistic structure. Perpendicular ribs of concrete divide its windows into narrow segments, and its stark, black on white façade rises strikingly from the thick greenery that surrounds it. Before becoming a library, it served as a branch of the National Bank of Poland (&quot;Narodowy Bank Polski / NBP&quot;).
** Formerly the Centrum Department Store, the Dino Supermarket on ulica Dworcowa exhibits an upper, street-side façade that is covered entirely by the tilted glass.
*Nazi Architecture
** Several examples of Nazi architecture exist in Konin, including a row of buildings in ulica Kolejowa, in New Konin, that were built as lodgings for railwaymen. Just across the street is a monument, commemorating an August, 1943, Jewish uprising. Another set of Nazi buildings stand in the Old Town, near ulica Szpitalna. This area is known locally as &quot;Heimat&quot;, emphasizing its German connection.
*Socialist Realism
** Aleje 1-go Maja (Avenue of the First of May), the main street of Nowy Konin, is lined with the city&#x27;s earliest examples of Socialist Realism architecture. Among these are the hospital and various public buildings. Because New Konin was developed primarily after the 1946 installation of the Communist government, it contains very little other than buildings constructed in the stark, Socialist Realism style.
** Osiedle V (Housing Estate No. 5), designed and built during the 1970s and the early 1980s, it consists characteristically of blocks of flats set in regular rows and devoid of any architectural decoration, a sombre testament to the economic difficulties of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland at the time of construction.
** The Zatorze District, built during the 1980s, consists largely of massive blocks of flats built of prefabricated, grey concrete structural elements, attended by shops and schools of the same style.
*Postmodernism
** Representing Catholic ecclesiastical Postmodernism, ten kilometres () from Konin stands the monumental Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń, the world&#x27;s sixth largest Christian church.
** The PKO BP S.A. bank and office building at ulica 11-go Listopada (Eleventh of November) 20 was one of the first large buildings erected in Konin after the 1989 fall of Communism in Poland. While having many features rooted in Socialist Realism, it incorporates Postmodernist elements not previously seen in Konin.
** The Skarpa office and commercial building at ulica Energetyka 6b was completed during the first decade of the 21st century. The utilitarian character of the building and its interior is in accord with the subtly adorned outer façades, which are covered with wide strips and plates in the colour of inox. The exterior pavement is covered with granite cuboids, and its inner floors are inlaid with dark granite plates.

===PTTK (Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society)===
Perhaps owing to Konin being located at the junction of some of Poland&#x27;s most historic lands - Greater Poland, Cuiavia, Mazovia, and Łódzkie - the local branch of the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society is very active. Moreover, the interest of non-Poles is piqued by the traces of, and monuments to, the many national minorities who have lived over the centuries in Konin and Konin County: Jews, Scots, Germans, Frenchmen, Russians, Romanis, Czechs, Swiss, Dutch Olędrzy, Vietnamese, Chinese, Romanians, and Africans.

Notably, Konin was one of the towns along the Scottish Trail - the route through urban areas of Greater Poland and Lower Silesia that connected the various Scottish trading communities that settled in Poland from the 15th century onward.

== Greenpeace Climate Rescue Station ==
Greenpeace chose the town to set up its Climate Rescue Station. A four-story energy self-sufficient globe replica was erected beside the Jozwin IIB open-cast coal mine. The location of the Rescue Station was intended to draw attention to Poland&#x27;s over-reliance on coal and formed part of Greenpeace&#x27;s campaign to get its message across at the United Nations&#x27; global warming Conference in nearby Poznań. The presence of Greenpeace was generally well received by locals who came in the hundreds to participate in activities and listen to lectures about the environmental situation. The Rescue station moved to Poznań following its stay at Konin.

<text>William Buckley (born 1776–1780died 30 January 1856), also known as the &quot;wild white man&quot;, was an English bricklayer, and served in the military until 1802, when he was convicted of theft. He was then transported to Australia, where he helped construct buildings for the fledgling penal settlement at Port Phillip Bay in what is now Victoria, Australia.

He escaped the settlement in 1803, and was given up for dead, while he lived among the Indigenous Wallarranga tribe of the Wathaurong nation for 32 years. In 1835, he was pardoned and became an Indigenous culture recorder. From 1837 to 1850 he was a public servant in Tasmania.

==Early life==
William Buckley was born in 1776 or 1780 in the village of Marton in the Macclesfield area of Cheshire, England. His father was a farmer.

As a child, he was adopted by his mother&#x27;s father, who lived in Macclesfield. His grandfather paid for his schooling, and at the age of 15 Buckley became an apprentice bricklayer working under Robert Wyatt. After his adoption, he was separated from his parents, two sisters, and a brother.

Buckley grew to the approximate height of , which was very unusual for the time. According to an acquaintance George Russell, Buckley &quot;was a tall, ungainly man ... and altogether his looks were not in his favour; he had a bushy head of black hair, a low forehead with overhanging eyebrows nearly concealing his small eyes, a short snub nose, a face very much marked by smallpox, and was just such a man as one would suppose fit to commit burglary or murder.&quot; That general description was echoed by other reports of the day, although not always as flattering. He was generally represented as being of low intelligence, but biographer Marjorie J. Tipping stated that &quot;according to his easy assimilation into an unfamiliar way of life may also suggest that he was intelligent, shrewd and courageous&quot;.

At about 19, Buckley enlisted in the Cheshire Militia, beginning a four-year military career. He was later at the 4th (King&#x27;s Own) Regiment of Foot. Because of his height, he was given the role of pivot man for the regiment. He had a good reputation with the officers. In 1799, his regiment went to The Netherlands to fight against Napoleon, under the command of the Duke of York. Buckley was severely wounded in his right hand.

The corps then was stationed at Chatham, where Buckley became restless and associated with several soldiers of bad character. According to Buckley, he was asked by a woman to carry a roll of cloth to the garrison where his regiment was stationed, not knowing that the fabric was stolen. Buckley was convicted on 2 August 1802 at the Sussex Assizes of knowingly receiving a roll of stolen cloth. He was sentenced to transportation to New South Wales for fourteen years or life. Due to the manner in which the military was prosecuted at the time, he was unaware of his final sentence. After his conviction, he never saw nor heard of his family again.

==Transportation and escape==

Buckley left England in April 1803 aboard , one of two ships sent to Port Phillip to form a new settlement under Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins. They arrived at the eastern side of Port Phillip Bay in October 1803 and landed at one of its small bays, Sullivan Bay near what is now Sorrento. Royal Marines and labourers encamped together. Skilled labourers, including Buckley, lived in huts nearer building sites. The skilled labourers were given a degree of freedom because there was more than of wilderness to the nearest settlement at Sydney, which made escape treacherous.

The new settlement lacked fresh water and arable soil, and a decision was made a couple of months later to abandon the site and move to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania). Buckley and five others escaped during a rain storm on 27 December 1803, to avoid being sent to Tasmania, hoping to escape to Port Jackson (Sydney). Of the six, Charles Shaw was shot by a soldier and was captured with another convict. Daniel Allender surrendered to Lieutenant Governor David Collins on 16 January 1804. The three remaining men subsisted on rations of food that they brought with them as well as seafood and berries that they collected, but they struggled to find enough food and fresh water. After travelling along the coast of Port Phillip Bay to what is now Melbourne and across the plains to the Yawong Hills (now in the Shire of Buloke), the men finished the last of their rations. They realised that to survive they needed to return to the bay for food. They doubled back to the west side of the bay to what is now Corio, Victoria and then to Swan Island. Along the way, they avoided huts of Indigenous people. The men attempted to signal a ship anchored in Port Phillip Bay without success for a week. His two fellow travellers decided to walk back to the eastern edge of Port Phillips Bay (Sullivan Bay). Buckley decided to try his luck on his own.

Over the next several days, Buckley became increasingly ill due to dehydration, starvation, and painful sores from poor nutrition. Buckley was near death when he arrived at Aireys Inlet where he found embers from an earlier fire, fresh water, seafood, and a cave for shelter. He stayed awhile to build back his strength and then he followed the Victorian coast south to a spot near a stream where he established a hut for himself of tree branches and seaweed. He foraged for plants, berries, and seafood to sustain himself.

==Life with the Wathaurong people==

Buckley met three spear-carrying Wathaurong people, who befriended him at a place called Nooraki (Mount Defiance Lookout, Wye River, Great Ocean Road). His visitors made him a meal of crayfish. They then asked Buckley to follow him to their huts, where they arrived by nightfall. In the morning the trio went on further into the woods, but Buckley communicated that he would remain in the area.

He returned to his hut along the creek on the western side of Port Phillip Bay. Winter was approaching and he was finding it increasingly difficult to collect adequate amounts of food and keep warm. Lonely and worn-down, he journeyed to the eastern portion of the bay in the hope that there were some English escapees who remained in the area. On his journey, he found a burial mound with a spear sticking out of the ground. He took it and used it as a walking stick. Further on his trek, he stumbled while crossing a stream and he was carried away by the current. He managed to get to the shore but was too exhausted to walk. The next morning, still quite feeble, he walked to a lake or lagoon known as Maamart by the Indigenous people. There he met two women who realised that he needed help, and with assistance of their husbands, they led Buckley to their huts. The people were members of the Wallarranga tribe of the Wathaurong nation. They believed him to be the spirit of a deceased tribal chief, whose spear he had taken from the burial mound. Buckley was given the name Murrangurk, which McHugh says was the chief&#x27;s name. Tim Flannery states that Muuranong guurk means &quot;one who has been killed and brought back to life again&quot;.

For the next several days, there were ceremonies of mourning and rejoicing. He was cared for and given food specifically selected and prepared to strengthen him. Buckley was taken in by the former chief&#x27;s brother, sister-in-law, and nephew. He was adopted into the tribe about one year after he had escaped. The Wallarranga tribe shared their food with him and taught him their language, customs, and bush skills. He learnt to catch fish and eels, cook in their manner, skin possums and kangaroo, and make thread from animal sinew. The tribe appeared to hunt and gather sufficient food. They had little illness and lived long lives. During the evenings, Buckley often shared his campfire with tribal members and told stories of life in England, on ships, and at war.
For thirty-two years, Buckley lived among the Wallarranga tribe of the Wathaurong nation on the Bellarine Peninsula of southern Victoria. He lived primarily near the mouth of Bream Creek, now known as Thompsons Creek, near present-day Breamlea and he also lived east at the mouth of the Barwin River. Living on the western side of the bay, he had access to fresh water, yam daisy (murnong), bream, seafood, and birds. His diet was supplemented with game—including kangaroo, wombat, koala, wallaby and turkey—that he hunted on the basalt plains. There were several shipwrecks along the coast in which no one survived. Buckley and other tribal members collected tools, blankets, and other items.

When Buckley showed himself to be a successful hunter, fisherman, and forager who provided for himself and the tribe, he was given a wife, with whom he had a daughter. A Buninyong woman, Purranmurnin Tallarwurnin, was 15 years old when she met Buckley and became his wife and she may have been the mother of his daughter. By 1881, she lived in Victoria&#x27;s Western District at the Framlingham Mission. He is also said to have been given a wife when he was single, but there was jealousy among some of the tribesmen and he was once again single.
He was treated with great affection and respect. &quot;By virtue of his age and peaceful ways, Buckley ... became a &quot;Ngurungaeta&quot;, a person of considerable respect among his people and his voice was influential in deciding matters of war and peace.&quot; Buckley became expert with Aboriginal weapons, though despite this, as a revered spirit, he was banned from participating in tribal wars. During one battle, the family who had taken him in and many other members of the clan were killed. Buckley then decided to live by himself, first along the Bass Strait coast and then along Bream Creek. He leveraged all that he had been taught about foraging for food, and then he figured out how to catch fish in greater number using a weir. He also began to dehydrate and preserve food. Members of the clan he had previously lived with joined him there. Over time, he forgot the English language and his hair grew very long.

Buckley had periods of time where he lived as a hermit, but he had become accustomed to his life among the Wallarranga tribe. For many years, he avoided meeting Europeans who visited or settled in the area. An escaped convict, he was afraid what would happen to him if he turned himself over to the Englishmen.

==Pardon==
In July 1835, a ship arrived at Indented Head and Buckley learnt that some of the Aboriginal people intended to murder the English passengers and rob the ship. On 6 July 1835, William Buckley and a party of Indigenous people appeared at the camp site of John Batman&#x27;s Port Phillip Association, led by John Wedge.

He wore kangaroo skins, carried Aboriginal weapons, and wore a tattoo with the initials &#x27;W.B.&#x27; and tattoo marks. William Todd recalled in his journal entry for 6 July 1835:
The tattoo of initials proved he was the convict William Buckley, who had been given up for dead three decades ago. Legally, he was still a convict and could be imprisoned again. Buckley had not used the English language for many years and had forgotten how to speak English, but it returned to him over time. Although still intent on raiding the Englishmen, Buckley convinced the Indigenous people not to attack the Englishmen, and he promised to reward them if they remained peaceful. Wedge obtained a pardon for Buckley through Lieutenant-Governor George Arthur.

==Return to Western culture==

Buckley was employed by John Batman to be an interpreter and help build his house in Melbourne. He was then an Indigenous language interpreter for the government.

On 4 February 1836, William Buckley accompanied Joseph Gellibrand and his party, which included William Robertson, one of the financiers of the Port Phillip Association, on a trip west from Melbourne, heading toward Geelong, where they met with a group of Wathaurong people with whom Buckley had lived. From Gellibrand&#x27;s diary:

February 5th, 1836: I directed Buckley to advance and we would follow him at a distance of a quarter of a mile. Buckley made towards a native well and after he had rode about 8 miles, we heard a cooey and when we arrived at the spot I witnessed one of the most pleasing and affecting sights. There were three men five women and about twelve children. Buckley had dismounted and they were all clinging around him and tears of joy and delight running down their cheeks... It was truly an affecting sight and proved the affection which these people entertained for Buckley ... amongst the number were a little old man and an old woman, one of his wives. Buckley told me this was his old friend with whom he had lived and associated thirty years.

By this time, Buckley was wearing clothes of the Englishmen. As he prepared to leave the gathering, his friends were disheartened to realise that he would not be living with them again.

During the course of his career as an interpreter and mediator, he tried to manage his role working for the government while also being concerned about equitable treatment of Aboriginal people. He felt that Indigenous people and influential white men were suspicious of him and he decided to move to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. In December 1837, he left Port Phillip and on 10 January 1838 he arrived in Hobart in what was then known as Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (Tasmania). He worked at the Immigrants&#x27; Home as assistant storekeeper. Four years later, he worked at the Female Factory as a gatekeeper.

On 27 June 1840, he was married to Julia Higgins, at St John&#x27;s Church, New Town, Hobart, by the Reverend T. J. Ewing. According to a contemporary, George Russell, she is said to have been as short as he was tall—so much so that when out walking she was too short to even reach his arm. To remedy this problem he would tie two corners of his handkerchief together, and after fastening this to his arm, she would put her arm through the loop. Julia was the 26 year-old widow of Daniel Higgins (he changed his surname from Eagers to Higgins upon coming to Australia), who allegedly had been murdered by Aboriginal people while en route overland from Sydney to Port Phillip in 1839. He had met the Higgins family, Daniel, Julia, and their daughter when he worked at the Immigrant&#x27;s Home. After Daniel&#x27;s death, Buckley asked his widow to marry him.

Buckley lived in the Arthur Circus neighbourhood of Battery Point, Hobart. He retired in 1850. Buckley was seriously injured after he was thrown from his gig at Greenpond near Hobart. He died of his injuries on 30 January 1856 at the age of 76. Buckley was interred at the burial ground of St George&#x27;s Anglican Church, Battery Point.

After his death, his widow Julia moved north to live with her daughter and son-in-law, William Jackson, and their family. Eventually they moved to Sydney. She died there at the Hyde Park Asylum on 18 August 1863.

==Legacy==
A plaque commemorates him at Buckley&#x27;s Rest, a small park in Sandy Bay, Hobart.

Buckley&#x27;s Falls near Woorongo was named after Buckley by John Helder Wedge.

==John Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Adventures of William Buckley&quot; as history==
Almost all we know of Buckley&#x27;s life with the Wathaurung people is based on the 1852 account written by John Morgan (1792–1866), &quot;Life and Adventures of William Buckley&quot;.
Written when the illiterate Buckley was 72 years old, it was clearly intended to make money for the insolvent Morgan and Buckley. As a result, the account has sometimes been dismissed as more the product of Morgan&#x27;s fertile imagination than a true representation of Buckley&#x27;s experiences. Its references to the mythical Bunyip and tribe of copper-coloured, pot-bellied &quot;Pallidurgbarrans&quot; who supposedly lived in the Otway forests are often cited as evidence of this. However, while acknowledging its limitations, some scholars, such as Lester Hiatt, see it as consistent with &quot;modern understandings of Aboriginal social life&quot;. Tim Flannery suggests that Buckley&#x27;s story has been &quot;ignored or mentioned only in passing by historians&quot; because it is &quot;so at odds with contemporary preconceptions&quot;. Another factor, he suggests, is that &quot;studies of Aboriginal Victoria have long relied heavily on archaeological research&quot;. Flannery cites Edward Curr, an early author of Aboriginal studies, who claimed Morgan&#x27;s book gave &quot;a truer account of Aboriginal life than any work I have read&quot;.

==&quot;You&#x27;ve got Buckley&#x27;s chance&quot;==
Buckley&#x27;s improbable survival is believed by many Australians to be the source of the vernacular phrase, &quot;you&#x27;ve got Buckley&#x27;s or none&quot; (or simply &quot;you&#x27;ve got Buckley&#x27;s&quot;), which means &quot;no chance&quot;, or &quot;it&#x27;s as good as impossible&quot;. The &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; supports this theory. The Australian National Dictionary Centre deprecates a second theory: that the expression was a pun on the name of a now defunct Melbourne department store chain, Buckley &amp; Nunn because this second explanation &quot;appears to have arisen after the original phrase was established&quot;.

The phrase “Buckley’s chance” spread outward from Australia with emigration and into the vernacular of other countries. For example, John Kennedy O’Brien (1907–1979, AKA Jack O’Brien) used this phrase to highlight inter-town travel difficulties following New Zealand’s Murchison Earthquake of 1929; “...from what Mr O’Brien saw of the country, the...man had only Buckley’s chance of reaching his goal”. Although John himself was born in New Zealand, his father, Kennedy Hugh O’Brien (1874-1927), was a native of Victoria, Australia, having emigrated to New Zealand in the mid-1890s, bringing some forms of colloquial language with him. “Buckley’s chance”, it seems, came with him.

<doc id="390534" wikidata="Q7300098" url="?curid=390534" title="Re Kevin">
<text>Re Kevin – Validity of Marriage of a Transsexual, also known simply as Re Kevin, was a 2001 Australian court case brought before the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia regarding the possibility of transsexual people to marry according to their new sex. The court granted the applicant this right.

The case had impacts beyond Australia, it was for example cited in the 2002 decisions of &quot;Goodwin vs. United Kingdom in the European Court of Human Rights&quot; and the 2003 decision &quot;Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit In And For Pasco County, Florida in the United States of America in The Marriage of Kantaras case number 98-5375CA 511998DR00537WS&quot;. In both of these cases, the right to marry in their new sex was affirmed.

== Background ==
At the time of &quot;Re Kevin&quot;, same-sex marriage was illegal in Australia. This case regards a transsexual man, using the alias of Kevin for this trial, who had married his wife under the assumption that the definition of man included transsexual men. The Attorney General affirmed that Kevin and his wife (alias Jennifer) were not legally able to get married as they had both been assigned the sex female at birth. The case went to court in Australian Family Court in 2001, with the parties being the Attorney General, Kevin, and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Attorney General rested his case on the earlier ruling of &quot;Corbett v Corbett (Otherwise Ashley) (1971)&quot;, which stated that sex was decided by biology at birth. The judge in this trial (Chisholm J) determined that measure to be insufficient, as it ignored the role of social and psychological aspects of gender. Ultimately, Chisholm J ruled that Kevin was, in the modern definition of the word, a man. This ruling was later used to affirm in other cases worldwide the marriage of transsexual people as the sex they identify with.

== Filing and arguments ==

The issue in the case was the definition of the word &quot;man&quot; in terms of marriage. At the time of &quot;Re Kevin&quot; (2001), same sex marriage was still illegal in Australia. Kevin had been assigned female at birth, but had identified as male since childhood. As an adult, Kevin attempted to get married but the Attorney General appealed the marriage. He pointed to the earlier ruling of &quot;Corbett v Corbett (Otherwise Ashley) (1971)&quot;, which ruled that sex is determined at birth by chromosomes, gonads and genitals. The judge in that ruling, Omrod J, decided that a transsexual male could not fulfill the role of a wife. The Attorney General attempted to use this ruling in the case of &quot;Re Kevin&quot;. Kevin and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission brought forth evidence to counter this. They based their arguments on proving to the judge that Kevin was, in all aspects of his life, male. Kevin had, at the time of his marriage, had surgeries to remove both primary and secondary female sexual characteristics, as well as hormone therapy. After these surgeries, Kevin had applied to the Registrar of Births, Deaths, and Marriages to have his sex legally changed. Additionally, for the trial, Kevin spoke to several psychologists to affirm that he identified as male. In court, the Judge heard from a total of four doctors and thirty nine other witnesses (twenty three of which were family or friends of Kevin, and sixteen of which were his colleagues). These witnesses spoke to the fact that Kevin was perceived as male in all aspects of his life. The case ultimately came down to the interpretation of the word &quot;Man&quot; in terms of marriage. Chisholm J had to decide whether to stand behind the finding of &quot;Corbett v Corbett&quot;, or whether to accept that the modern interpretation of the word man includes transsexual and transgender individuals.

== Holding ==

Chisholm J had to make his ruling based not only on Kevin&#x27;s identity, but on the meaning of the statute and the past ruling of &quot;Corbett v Corbett&quot;. In this trial, the Attorney General based most of his argument on the ruling of Corbett. As such, the judge had to examine it to decide if the ruling was applicable to this case. Ultimately he decided to overrule Corbett, coming to the decision that marriage is not purely sexual, and that the ability to bear children isn&#x27;t required. He also ruled that the ruling of Corbett ignored the psychological and social impact of gender. Ultimately, he found that Corbett was not applicable to &quot;Re Kevin&quot;. The last component of Chisholm J&#x27;s decision was the constitution, which he decided was up to modern interpretation. Since the common definition of &quot;Man&quot; in Australia in 2001 included a post-operation transsexual man, then it followed that the constitution must include that in terms of marriage. For these reasons, it was ruled that Kevin&#x27;s marriage was valid as he was male at the time of the marriage.

== Social implications ==

There were broader social implications of this case than just the ruling for Kevin and Jennifer. One key point of contention in the trial was the use of the term Transsexual. The judge felt the term to be dehumanizing, and he felt that since Kevin had always identified as male, that the term was not quite accurate. However, this case took place before the popularization of the word transgender, and as such the judge used transsexual but acknowledged the issues of the word in the official trial documents. Another issue was the trial as a whole. This was a landmark case. Australia had never seen a decision that affirmed the rights of transsexual and transgender people to marry as the sex/gender they identify as. In fact, most places world-wide had not seen a decision that did that. This trial marked a victory for equal rights. This case has since been referenced in many cases worldwide, helping to allow transsexual and transgender people to marry as their preferred sex/gender.

<doc id="390537" wikidata="Q9977" url="?curid=390537" title="Xuande Emperor">
<text>The Xuande Emperor (16 March 1399 31 January 1435), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Xuanzong of Ming, personal name Zhu Zhanji, was the fifth emperor of the Ming dynasty, reigning from 1425 to 1435. He was the son and successor of the Hongxi Emperor.

The Xuande Emperor was the son of Zhu Gaochi, who would later become the Hongxi Emperor. He had a passion for poetry and literature, and was also known for his skill in painting and warfare. In 1425, following his father&#x27;s brief reign, he ascended to the throne as the emperor of the Ming dynasty. Upon taking power, he made the decision to reverse his father&#x27;s plan to relocate the capital from Beijing to Nanjing. His uncle Zhu Gaoxu rebelled against the young emperor but was ultimately unsuccessful. With the guidance of capable advisors, the Xuande Emperor personally led his army against his uncle and easily defeated him.

In the early Xuande Emperor&#x27;s reign, a prolonged war in Jiaozhi (present-day northern Vietnam) ended with Ming defeat and the Viet&#x27;s independence. Relations with Southeast Asian nations stayed peaceful. Communication continued with Korea, and ties were established with Japan in 1432. The northern region faced minimal Mongol threats, with relations established with the Eastern Mongols and Western Oirats. The Xuande Emperor permitted Zheng He&#x27;s final Indian Ocean voyage in 1431–1433. During the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s rule, eunuchs gained influence, particularly in the secret police. The emperor sought order through purges in the Censorate and military service reforms in 1428, but these didn&#x27;t fully address inefficiencies and low morale among hereditary soldiers.

The Xuande Emperor&#x27;s government attempted to promote the use of paper money and discourage the use of coins and precious metals, but this effort was ultimately unsuccessful and paper money fell out of circulation. In the past, high taxes in heavily taxed prefectures, particularly in Jiangnan, had caused peasants to leave the economy. In response, the Xuande Emperor lowered taxes and dispatched &quot;grand coordinators&quot; to the provinces to improve the performance of local authorities. These coordinators were responsible for addressing issues of injustice and corruption among tax collectors, as well as assessing the state of military units.

After a short reign of ten years, the emperor died due to a brief illness. His rule was marked by a period of relative peace, with no major internal or foreign conflicts. Later historians regarded his reign as the golden age of the dynasty.

==Youth==
Zhu Zhanji, the future Xuande Emperor, was the eldest son of the Hongxi Emperor (1378–1425; reigned from 1424) and Empress Zhang (1379–1442). He was born on 16 March 1399. At the time, Zhu Zhanji&#x27;s parents lived in Beijing, northeast China, in the palace of his grandfather, Zhu Di, the later Yongle Emperor, who was then known as Prince of Yan. In the summer of 1399, Zhu Di rebelled against the Jianwen Emperor, defeated him in a three-year civil war, and became the third Ming emperor in 1402.

As a child, Zhu Zhanji was trained in both military skills and Confucian literature by Hanlin academics. He was a talented man of letters, but his physical prowess, in contrast to his father&#x27;s frail health, made him excel in military disciplines. This impressed Yongle Emperor, who shared Zhu Zhanji&#x27;s love for hunting and riding. Yongle allowed him to accompany him on hunting trips and military inspections. In 1414, the Yongle Emperor even took the young prince with him on a campaign against the Mongols. Later, as emperor, Zhu Zhanji personally participated in skirmishes with the Mongols on the northern border. During one of these battles, he demonstrated his skill with a bow by shooting several Mongol warriors.

In 1411, Zhu Zhanji was appointed as &quot;Huang Taisun&quot; (; literally &#x27;imperial grandson-heir&#x27;) while his father had been &quot;Huang Taizi&quot; (; literally &#x27;crown prince&#x27;) since 1404. Zhu Zhanji&#x27;s education in Confucian teachings and ways of government was overseen by Grand Secretary Hu Guang (). He also dedicated himself to studying military expeditions. In court intrigues, Zhu Zhanji consistently defended his father against his uncles Zhu Gaoxu and Zhu Gaosui, who were the younger sons of the Yongle Emperor. This earned him their resentment. They were also concerned about his decisiveness, popularity with Yongle, and close cooperation with the Grand Secretaries. They feared that their own positions would be threatened if Zhu Zhanji were to take over.

==Beginning of reign==
===Accession===
In August 1424, the Yongle Emperor died due to a stroke while returning from the fifth Mongol campaign in the Mongolian steppe. His son, the Hongxi Emperor, succeeded him as the new emperor of the Ming dynasty at the start of September. On 1 November 1424, the Hongxi Emperor named Zhu Zhanji as crown prince. In April 1425, he sent the prince to Nanjing to make preparations for the relocation of the capital from Beijing. However, the Hongxi Emperor&#x27;s health deteriorated and he called the prince back, but died before his son could return.

On 27 June 1425, Zhu Zhanji officially ascended the imperial throne in Beijing, becoming the fifth emperor of the Ming dynasty. He chose to cancel the move of the capital to Nanjing due to his familiarity with Beijing, where he grew up, and his shared concern with the Yongle Emperor for the security of the northern border. He adopted the era name Xuande, which means &quot;proclamation of virtue&quot;.

Upon his accession, the new emperor&#x27;s officials received him calmly, as he shared his father&#x27;s idealistic conservative policies. He was not only a man of letters, but also a patron of the arts, and his reign was marked by significant cultural and political achievements. Despite his short temper, he was open to advice. As an emperor, he was conscientious and sought to balance the influence of various factions within the Ming elite–including civil officials, eunuchs, and generals. While he was capable of making strong decisions when necessary, he typically relied on the proposals of the Grand Secretaries and ministers when issuing imperial decrees. In contrast to his predecessors, he lived a life of luxury and debauchery, and upon his death, thousands of women were released from the palace.

Despite this, he successfully resolved major issues during the first two years of his reign, including his uncle&#x27;s rebellion and the war in Jiaozhi. Under his rule, the northern border remained relatively stable and peaceful relations were maintained with neighboring states in Central, East, and Southeast Asia. This stability allowed for internal reforms to take place.

===Zhu Gaoxu rebellion===
The accession of the young emperor was challenged by his uncle, Zhu Gaoxu, but unlike the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s usurpation, he was unsuccessful in his attempt. Zhu Gaoxu was favored by the Yongle Emperor due to his military prowess. He proved to be a capable and energetic commander during the civil war of 1399–1402, but his arrogance and contempt towards his older brother, the Hongxi Emperor, who was the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s father, caused tension. Zhu Gaoxu became bitter when he was not named as a successor in 1404. His disobedience eventually led to his banishment to the backwater city of Le&#x27;an in Qingzhou prefecture, Shandong. Believing that he was the rightful heir to the throne in 1424, instead of his ailing older brother, he began plotting a coup after his brother&#x27;s death. Shortly after the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s ascension to the throne on 2 September 1425, he attempted to follow in the footsteps of the Yongle Emperor by rebelling against the emperor. He accused the Xuande Emperor of abusing his power by appointing individuals with noble titles to civil offices and appointing unworthy individuals. Underestimating his young nephew as a formidable opponent, he also failed to recognize the strength of the government, which had functioned effectively during the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s extended absences on campaigns in Mongolia. Furthermore, he did not consider the significant decrease in the princes&#x27; influence that the Yongle Emperor had achieved. As a result, he was in a much weaker position than Yongle had been in 1399.

The emperor initially hesitated, but eventually succumbed to pressure from Grand Secretary Yang Rong and other advisors, ultimately taking personal command of the punitive expedition on 9 September. A vanguard of 20,000 soldiers, led by the experienced general Xue Lu (; 1358–1430), laid siege to Le&#x27;an on 21 September. Despite the defenders&#x27; refusal to surrender, the imperial army successfully captured the city the following day. Zhu Gaoxu was subsequently brought to Beijing, demoted to a common subject, and ultimately tortured to death. In addition, over 600 of his followers were executed, while another 2,200 were deported to the border. An investigation revealed that other relatives of the emperor, including the rebel&#x27;s brother Zhu Gaosui, were also involved in the rebellion, but they were not punished in order to preserve the prestige of the imperial family.

==Government==
===Grand Secretaries, ministers, and eunuchs===

The Xuande Emperor retained his father&#x27;s advisers and ministers, but some offices underwent changes in their functions. The most significant reforms were made to the Grand Secretaries, who, during the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s reign, only had an advisory role of reading the emperor&#x27;s correspondence and drafting replies. During the reign of the Hongxi Emperor, they gained more influence and were now granted real executive power. This was formalized by granting ministerial titles to Yang Shiqi (Minister of War), Huang Huai (Minister of Revenue), and Jin Youzi (Minister of Rites). Due to their long service to the state, they were highly respected and trusted by the emperor. Other close advisers to the emperor included Jian Yi (Minister of Personnel from 1402–1422 and 1423–1435) and Xia Yuanji (Minister of Revenue from 1402–1421 and 1424–1430). Even after the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s death, the composition of the most influential officials and the grand secretaries remained unchanged. As a result, the top government was dominated by the same group of people from 1424 until the early 1440s.

The emperor established a process for routine and important decrees, in which proposals from various offices were reviewed and evaluated by the Grand Secretaries. These secretaries would then attach their recommendations for solving issues to the documents, which the emperor would typically approve and send to the relevant ministries for implementation. Significant government decisions were made during meetings between the emperor and the grand secretaries, during which the emperor would discuss and sign the drafts of his decrees. The ministers were responsible for carrying out these decrees. This system allowed for faster and more flexible decision-making, as the secretaries no longer needed to consult with the ministers beforehand.
At the same time, the influence of the eunuchs serving in the imperial palace and completely dependent on the emperor grew. During the reign of the Hongwu Emperor, the first Ming emperor, eunuchs were prohibited from communicating with government authorities. Even the Yongle Emperor maintained strict control over them. The Xuande Emperor, on the other hand, provided them with education and utilized them more in confidential correspondence. Despite opposition from officials, the eunuchs&#x27; business continued to thrive, benefiting the emperor&#x27;s personal projects such as logging and shipbuilding. In situations where the emperor did not agree with the ideas of Grand Secretaries, he would use eunuchs to convey his orders to lower branches of the state administration. As the ministers did not question the emperor&#x27;s orders, the eunuchs were able to give orders to the ministers on behalf of the sovereign without his knowledge. This abuse of power was a major concern for the Hongwu Emperor. The Xuande Emperor, however, maintained control over the eunuchs and was not afraid to execute them if they overstepped their boundaries. In the long run, this approach left room for eunuchs to exploit their power if a less assertive emperor was in power.

===Censorate, provincial administration, and army===
In terms of internal politics, the emperor focused on implementing reforms in the Censorate, local administration, and the army. His main goal was to bring discipline and order to the state administration. He also took a keen interest in prominent criminal cases and often ordered judgments to be reviewed, resulting in justice for thousands of innocent people. In August 1428, he replaced the long-standing head of the Censorate, Liu Quan (), who had been in the position since 1415, with the honorable Gu Zuo (). Within a few months, Gu Zuo dismissed 43 censors from the Beijing and Nanjing offices, and Liu Quan himself was punished for numerous abuses of power. The Censorate underwent a reorganization, with changes made to procedures and an increase in the powers of the censors. Additionally, commissioners were appointed to oversee military farms, large construction projects, and military training camps near Beijing, as well as to manage taxes in South Zhili. These taxes were collected in the form of products, mainly rice, which was crucial for the nutrition of the people of Beijing.

After the purge of 1428, the censors became more efficient and open. This was evident in their thorough checks of all branches of the state administration, including both civil and military sectors. In fact, over 240 officials were dismissed between 1424 and 1434, which was three times the number of dismissals in the previous decade. While officials and censors who abused their powers were punished, they were not executed.

During the reign of the Xuande Emperor, the regional administration saw a regular posting of grand coordinators (&quot;xunfu&quot;). These officials were responsible for coordinating the work of the three provincial offices—civil, military, and surveillance. This practice of having coordinators in the regional administration was not new, as previous emperors had also employed them. For example, the Hongwu Emperor had sent his crown prince, Zhu Biao, to &quot;tour and pacify&quot;, while the Yongle Emperor had sent both the Hongxi and Xuande emperors to the provinces. In 1421, the Yongle Emperor even sent 26 high-ranking government officials to the provinces. The Xuande Emperor took this practice a step further by sending these officials on long-term assignments, rather than just once like his predecessors. For example, in September 1425, he sent two commissioners to South Zhili and Zhejiang, and in 1430, they were sent to Hunan, Shanxi, and Sichuan. They were also dispatched to Jiangxi and Shaanxi around 1426.

The role of grand coordinators was not an independent function, but rather a mandate imposed on high-ranking officials of the central authorities. Typically, these officials held the rank of deputy minister, particularly in the military, and later also held high positions in the Censorate. They also held the rank of (co-)superintendant of military affairs. This gave them the authority to oversee civil, military, and surveillance offices. The immediate result of implementing grand coordinators was the transfer of command over troops in the provinces to civilian hands. The system of grand coordinators reached its final form during the Zhengtong era (1436–1449), when they were assigned to all provinces except Fujian and six of the nine frontier garrisons on the northern border.

Considerable problems persisted in the army during this time period. Corrupt officers were known to bring in poor conscripts for campaigns, while allowing the wealthy to avoid service for a fee. These officers also embezzled the salaries of the soldiers and used them as personal servants. The supply of military farms was also a major issue, as it often dropped and made it difficult to properly equip the army. Additionally, capable officers had limited opportunities for advancement during times of peace, resulting in the army being led by individuals who inherited their positions without merit. These commanders, who had not experienced war themselves, often neglected to properly train their soldiers and instead used them for their own personal needs. This led to a decline in discipline, an increase in desertion, and a decrease in the overall strength of the army. 

In an attempt to address these issues, inspection officials were appointed in 1427 to verify the condition and numbers of the army detachments and restore discipline, but their efforts were largely ineffective. The local military headquarters also came under the supervision of control authorities, but this did not have much impact either. In 1429, the emperor attempted to boost morale by holding a large military parade with guard units from the Beijing garrison and three training camps located around Beijing, but this did not have a significant impact on the morale of the army. The years of peace had led to a decline in the quality of training, and the emperor&#x27;s leniency towards guilty officers only worsened the situation. The consequences of this decline in the army&#x27;s strength were not fully realized until 1449, at the Battle of Tumu, when the Mongols were able to defeat the Ming army led by Emperor Yingzong and even take the emperor prisoner. This event highlighted the weakness of the Ming armies due to the prolonged period of peace.

==Economic policy==
===Finance and currency===

In the late 1420s, the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s government faced significant financial challenges. The ongoing war in Jiaozhi drained a significant amount of resources, and the subsequent loss of mineral wealth further exacerbated the situation. The imposition of high taxes and levies placed an unbearable burden on the economy of wealthy regions in China, resulting in a decline in government revenue. For instance, Suzhou, the economic hub of China, was three years behind in paying its taxes by the late 1420s. Moreover, the profitability of silver and copper mines declined in the early 1430s. To address these difficulties, the government attempted to promote the use of paper money, reduce and reform taxes, and limit government spending.

The founder of the Ming dynasty, the Hongwu Emperor, established paper money, known as &quot;baochao&quot; banknotes, as the primary form of currency. For smaller transactions, copper coins were also used, which were circulated alongside state notes during the Yongle era. However, both the coins and the copper used to make them were in short supply. In contrast, the government printed large quantities of banknotes, causing their value to rapidly decrease. By 1425, &quot;baochao&quot; banknotes were only worth 2% of their nominal value. In an unsuccessful attempt to promote paper currency, the Hongxi Emperor, the predecessor of the Xuande Emperor, closed precious metal mines. However, the Xuande government allowed for a partial resumption of mining.

The Xuande Emperor and his advisers implemented various measures in an attempt to support the state&#x27;s economy. One such measure was the pressure placed on the use of copper coins, which were seen as competition for paper money. As a result, copper coins were almost completely phased out of circulation. In addition, Minister of Revenue Xia Yuanji suggested a solution to combat the decline in the value of government banknotes by increasing business taxes and only accepting payment in government banknotes, but this approach did not yield the desired results. The government then shifted to a more cautious strategy, selling licenses to trade salt for state coins. This measure also failed to increase the value of state stamps. The government also introduced new trade fees and customs duties on the Grand Canal, which could only be paid in shillings, but these fees had a negative impact on trade. As a result, there was strong opposition to these fees and they were eventually abolished after a few years. Despite the government&#x27;s efforts, these measures did not effectively support the state&#x27;s economy. The value of paper money continued to decline. By the 1430s, banknotes were no longer in use and were only used to pay employees to a limited extent. They were also withdrawn as a mandatory form of payment for trade fees. Ultimately, these measures had little impact on the country&#x27;s economy.

The widespread distrust of paper currency and the scarcity of coins resulted in a growing trade in silver. Despite the government&#x27;s opposition to replacing copper coins and paper currency with silver, attempts to prohibit the use of silver in commercial transactions were unsuccessful, but silver alone was not enough to meet the demands of the market. It was primarily used for large payments and paying taxes, while copper coins remained the preferred currency for smaller transactions in cities. 

In 1433, the Xuande government closed the mints, causing disruptions throughout the region from Japan to Java. This halt in coin production led to a surge in counterfeit coins and hoarding of precious metals. Despite the dissatisfaction of officials in Beijing, they were unable to suppress the circulation of coins produced by private entrepreneurs, but they also did not make the decision to resume state production of coins. Towards the end of the Xuande era, the government began to tolerate the use of silver. In 1433, Governor of South Zhili Zhou Chen began to collect land taxes in silver in the most heavily burdened prefectures of Jiangnan.

===Taxation in Jiangnan and the empire===
One of the areas that the emperor focused on for reform was fiscal policy, particularly in Jiangnan. This region, which includes prefectures such as Suzhou, Hangzhou, Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Zhenjiang, contributed a significant portion of the empire&#x27;s land tax, accounting for a quarter of the total amount (despite the Ming dynasty having almost 160 prefectures). In Suzhou Prefecture alone, even after a reduction in the tax rate in 1393, the land tax still made up almost a tenth of the empire&#x27;s total tax quota, equivalent to 2.81 million &quot;shi&quot; of rice (with 1 &quot;shi&quot; being equivalent to 107.4 liters). Additionally, Songjiang Prefecture contributed 4.14% of the total tax quota.

During the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s reign, the country saw a ten percent increase in land tax revenue, which was likely distributed evenly throughout the country. However, this increase in taxes proved to be too much for the peasants in Suzhou and Songjiang, leading to a growing number of tax arrears. As if this was not enough, natural disasters struck towards the end of Yongle&#x27;s reign, causing even more peasants to abandon their land. By 1422–28, the amount of tax arrears had reached several million &quot;shi&quot; of rice annually. This posed a serious threat to the supply of Beijing, which relied on tax rice shipped from Jiangnan via the Grand Canal. In an effort to maintain a steady supply of rice, the government decided to reduce taxes and forgive a portion of the arrears. In August 1426, imperial commissioner Zhou Gan () was tasked with investigating the situation on the ground. He proposed a plan to reduce taxes, eliminate corruption in tax collection, and improve local administration with the help of experts sent from headquarters, led by a special commissioner. While the reduction of taxes was supported by the great secretaries, the Ministry of Revenue was able to delay its implementation for four years. Finally, in May 1430, the relevant imperial decree was issued.

In October 1430, the emperor dispatched a group of high-ranking officials (&quot;zongdu&quot;) to oversee the collection of taxes. Among them was Zhou Chen (), Left Vice Minister of Works, who was sent to South Zhili. Along with Kuang Zhong (), the prefect of Suzhou since June 1430, they played a significant role in implementing tax reforms in Jiangnan. During their visit, they witnessed the aftermath of a large-scale migration from the region, with some areas losing up to ninety percent of their peasant population. As a result, the remaining households were burdened with the same total amount of taxes. To address this issue, Zhou Chen introduced five major measures:
* unified measures and weights to prevent collectors from cheating;
* in each county, warehouses were built to collect the tax rice; previously, it had been stored in barns by tax captains (landowners responsible for transporting rice from villages to designated locations, such as the capital);
* the government introduced a tax supplement designated for covering the costs of transportation along the Grand Canal to Beijing, thereby easing the burden on taxpayers who only transported rice to the canal, rather than all the way to Beijing;
* in each county, restored support granaries where surplus crops were stored in fertile years in case of famine;
* introduced the collection of a portion of taxes not in rice, but in silver and fabrics, which was beneficial for both taxpayers and the government, and in the southern regions of the empire, it promoted the monetization of the economy and the textile industry.

The emperor generally agreed with the proposals of Zhou Chen and Kuang Zhong, but the Ministry of Revenue blocked them. For example, it was not until 1433 that he received approval to reduce taxes in Suzhou by a quarter. However, other reforms in the same direction continued after 1436. 

During natural disasters and epidemics, the Xuande government was known for its swift and effective response in aiding the population. Specially appointed commissioners oversaw the distribution of grain from government stocks, as well as implementing a 20–40% reduction in land taxes and forgiving other taxes for a period of one to two years. These actions were highly praised and recorded in the official history of the dynasty. 

In comparison to previous reigns, land tax revenue during the Xuande era decreased to 30 million &quot;shi&quot; of rice, which was 8% less than during the Hongxi era and 5% less than during the Yongle era. The trend continued in the Zhengtong era (1436–1449) with a further reduction of 10–15%. By the end of the Ming dynasty, the land tax remained at 25–28 million &quot;shi&quot;. This reduction in expenses allowed the state to maintain a balanced budget during the Xuande era, a feat that was not always achieved in later eras.

==Foreign policy==
===Jiaozhi/Đại Việt===
During the early years of the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s reign, a major issue that arose was the war in Jiaozhi Province, or Đại Việt under Ming rule (present-day northern Vietnam), which had been ongoing since 1408. In 1425, Ming troops, led by newly appointed commanders Li An () and Chen Zhi, suffered multiple defeats at the hands of the Viets, led by Lê Lợi. In response, the emperor appointed a new commander, Wang Tong (), and a new head of civil administration, minister Chen Qia (), in May 1426. Seeking advice from his entourage, the emperor recalled the Hongwu Emperor&#x27;s prohibition on invading Đại Việt (and other countries) and the Yongle Emperor&#x27;s original goal of restoring the Trần dynasty. Ministers Jian Yi and Xia Yuanji advocated for using military force to suppress Viet resistance, while Grand Secretaries Yang Shiqi and Yang Yong suggested withdrawing from Jiaozhi, but due to conflicting opinions, the meeting ended without a resolution.
In the winter of 1426, the Ming army suffered heavy losses of 20,000–30,000 men due to Viet attacks. To counter this threat, the emperor issued orders in January 1427 for Mu Sheng, the commander of Yunnan troops, to gather an army in Yunnan and bring it to Jiaozhi. Additionally, General Liu Sheng () was tasked with leading a second army from Guangxi. To oversee the civil administration of the province, the experienced Huang Fu was appointed (Huang Fu had previously administered Jiaozhi from 1407–1424). Meanwhile, Lê Lợi continued to expand his operations into the Red River Valley, posing a threat to Đông Quan, the capital of the province (present-day Hanoi). Despite this, the Ming garrison successfully defended against the attack on Đông Quan, but due to the incompetence of Wang Tong, the Ming forces failed to capitalize on their success, allowing the Viets to prepare for the arrival of reinforcements.

On 30 September 1427, Liu Sheng&#x27;s army reached the border, where Lê Lợi unexpectedly proposed handing over power to Trần Cảo, a descendant of the Trần dynasty. This proposal was made under the condition that Trần Cảo would rule under Chinese suzerainty. However, Lê Lợi had ulterior motives and immediately lured Liu Sheng&#x27;s army into a trap, resulting in a crushing defeat. The Chinese army suffered heavy losses, with approximately 70,000 men killed. In the aftermath of this disaster, Wang Tong, without the emperor&#x27;s knowledge, accepted Lê Lợi&#x27;s proposal and began withdrawing troops from Jiaozhi on 12 November. Meanwhile, Mu Sheng had reached the upper reaches of the Red River and began constructing ships to advance downstream, but upon learning of Wang Tong&#x27;s withdrawal, Mu Sheng retreated back to China.

On 16 November 1427, the Xuande Emperor was informed of Lê Lợi&#x27;s offer. Despite divided opinions from his advisers, the emperor quickly made the decision to accept the proposal on 20 November. A delegation was immediately sent to Jiaozhi to negotiate the details. This move was seen as a surrender by the Ming after their defeat in battle, solidifying Lê Lợi&#x27;s prestige. Lê Lợi informed the negotiators that Trần Cảo had died, another member of the Trần family was no longer alive, and they should recognize him as the king. He also refused to repatriate Chinese prisoners and officials. The Xuande Emperor, however, refused to recognize Lê Lợi as the ruler of Đại Việt and demanded the return of the Trần dynasty. It was not until 1431, when Lê Lợi sent a humble letter, that the Xuande Emperor appointed him as &quot;administrator of the affairs of the state of Annan&quot; (Annan being the Chinese name for Đại Việt). Lê Lợi&#x27;s son was officially recognized and given a royal title by the Beijing government in November 1436, after the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s death. 

The Ming&#x27;s withdrawal from Jiaozhi was a blow to their pride and prestige, but it also provided much-needed financial relief. For the Viets, it was a significant victory that left a lasting impact on their culture and state. The two decades of Ming rule and education had a transformative effect on Đại Việt. The long-term warfare also resulted in a strong and efficient Viet army, which would later be challenged by Champa, located further south.

===Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean===

Envoys from Southeast Asian countries, such as Champa, Java, Ayutthaya, and Sumatra, regularly visited Beijing, but there were no envoys from the Indian Ocean coast. The ban on unauthorized trade and overseas travel by subjects was still in place, but it was not effectively enforced. 

Government officials strongly opposed long-distance voyages and influenced the emperor to cancel a shipbuilding program in 1429, led by the emperor&#x27;s eunuchs. A few months later, after the death of a leading opponent of the voyages, Xia Yuanji, the emperor changed his mind. The last of Zheng He&#x27;s great expeditions took place in 1430–33, possibly to restore the empire&#x27;s prestige after their retreat from Jiaozhi. Zheng He brought envoys from Sri Lanka, Cochin, Calicut, Hormuz, Aden, the East African coast, and other countries to China, which pleased the emperor.

After the death of the Xuande Emperor, the Ming did not undertake any further long-distance expeditions. These expeditions were only supported by the palace eunuchs, as the Confucian officials were strongly opposed to them. With the opening of the Grand Canal, the need to transport rice by sea to the north disappeared, leading officials to view naval expeditions as expensive and unnecessary imperial ventures. This decision had long-term negative consequences, as it weakened the morale and strength of the Ming fleet, leaving them later unable to effectively deal with the wokou pirates. Additionally, it also had a negative impact on China&#x27;s influence in Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. As a result, the end of the early Ming period marked the end of the three-hundred-year China&#x27;s dominance in the East Asian seas.

===Mongolia===
During the Xuande era, there was relative calm on the northern border. The Jurchens, who lived in present-day Manchuria, acknowledged Ming sovereignty and did not oppose the expeditions led by eunuch Yishiha. These expeditions even reached the mouth of the Amur River. The Eastern Mongols were ruled by Arughtai, while the Western Mongolian Oirats were led by Toghon. However, Arughtai was not recognized by the Uriankhai Mongols in the southeast of Mongolia. As a result, he maintained friendly relations with the Ming dynasty and engaged in trade, exchanging horses for silk and tea.

In October 1428, the Uriankhaians were known to occasionally raid the borderlands, but during an inspection in which the emperor was accompanied by 3,000 soldiers, they were successfully driven away. By May 1430, the Chinese had fortified cities along the border between China and the steppe (along the later Great Wall of China) south of Kaiping (formerly the Yuan capital of Shangdu and the last Ming garrison in the steppe) and then withdrew from it. This shortened the border, providing relief to exhausted troops, but was later criticized by historians. This shift in the border to the south and the loss of a base in the steppe made it much more challenging for the Chinese to conduct raids against the Mongols.

The Ming government had hoped that the Eastern Mongols would be able to defeat the Oirats, but the Oirats proved to be stronger and launched repeated attacks against the Eastern Mongols. In September 1434, the Oirats were successful in defeating and killing Arughtai, and Toghon maintained good relations with the Ming government, a relationship that has continued since then.

===Japan and Korea===
The Xuande Emperor made repeated attempts to establish relations with Japan, but shogun Yoshimochi (shōgun 1394–1425, effectively ruled 1408–1428) adamantly refused any communication. However, his successor Yoshinori (reigned 1429–1441) was very interested in trade with China. In 1432, using the mediation of the king of the Ryukyu Islands, Ming envoys arrived at the shogun&#x27;s court. The first Japanese delegation arrived in China in June 1433, bringing with them horses, armor, swords, and other goods. They also brought 2.6 tons of copper. The Ming government paid for these goods with banknotes (&quot;baochao&quot;), which the Japanese immediately exchanged for silk (one-fifth) and copper coins (the rest).

The Ming authorities only accepted Japanese traders at the port of Ningbo. After 1433, Japanese delegations arriving in China were primarily composed of agents of daimyos, monasteries, and temples who were eager to access the Chinese market. Along with luxury goods, they were particularly interested in Chinese copper coins. This trade proved to be highly profitable for the Japanese, leading to a lasting relationship between the two countries until 1529. However, there were frequent disputes over the valuation of Japanese goods and the Ming government often complained about the Japanese government&#x27;s inability to control piracy. Despite this, the shoguns were unable to effectively intervene against the pirates due to a lack of resources.

Relations with Korea were generally peaceful, with regular delegations traveling between the two capitals. According to Chinese records, the emperor often requested horses from the Koreans, while also asking them not to send gold, silver, or other unusual gifts that were not produced in their country. Additionally, the emperor rejected a request to admit Korean students to the Imperial University in Beijing, instead donating a collection of Confucian classics and historical literature to Korea as a replacement. While the official Chinese description of the relationship emphasizes mutual respect, Korean records highlight the emperor&#x27;s personal motives for his requests—including a desire for women (after the emperor&#x27;s death, the Ming government allowed fifty-three Korean women to return to their homeland), falcons, hunting dogs, tigers, cooks, and eunuchs.

==The emperor as an artist==

The Xuande Emperor was an ideal combination of the virtues of a Chinese warrior and scholar. He was a talented artist and poet, and often found more enjoyment in art and leisure than in his duties as ruler. He was known for his skill in calligraphy, poetry, writing, and painting. He painted landscapes, figures, &quot;grass and insects&quot;, and particularly enjoyed the genre of &quot;flowers and birds&quot;. He was especially skilled in depicting animals, particularly dogs. He drew inspiration from the techniques and styles of literati painters of his time, particularly Xia Chang. He typically used ink without the use of colors, choosing subjects with symbolic and allegorical meanings. He was considered the best painter among Chinese emperors since Emperor Huizong of Song (r. 1100–1126).

Some of his works are held by prestigious institutions such as the National Palace Museum in Taipei, the Palace Museum in Beijing, and formerly in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum (a division of Harvard Art Museum) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2007, Robert D. Mowry, the curator of Chinese Art Collections at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum, described him as &quot;the only Ming emperor who displayed genuine artistic talent and interest&quot;. The Dutch orientalist Robert van Gulik (1910–1967) praised one of the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s paintings, &quot;Gibbons at play&quot;, as &quot;skilfully painted&quot; although &quot;not a beautiful work&quot;. The vibrant paintings suggest that the emperor painted from real animals, likely kept in the palace gardens.

Not only did the emperor engage with art, but he also actively supported and influenced artistic trends of his time. He personally evaluated the works of painters applying for court positions and aimed to elevate court painting to the level of the peak of Song era culture in the early 12th century. He also financially supported several calligraphers and painters, such as Shang Xi, by appointing them as officers of the Imperial Guard. His reign is also renowned for its exceptional craftsmanship in bronzes and porcelain, particularly the famous Jingdezhen blue and white.

==Death and succession==
In the autumn and winter of 1434, the emperor led a military detachment on a tour of the northern border, but upon returning to Beijing, he fell ill. He was sick for almost two months, until he suddenly died on 31 January 1435. He died in the Palace of Heavenly Purity in the Forbidden City. He was given the posthumous name Emperor Zhang (; &#x27;Distinguished Emperor&#x27;) and the temple name Xuanzong (; &#x27;Penetrating Ancestor&#x27;). He was buried in the Jing Mausoleum in the Ming tombs near Beijing. He left behind two sons and two daughters, with one daughter died in infancy.

The Xuande Emperor&#x27;s successor was his elder son, Zhu Qizhen, who had been created crown prince in May 1428. He became emperor at the young age of eight. However, the rules established by the Hongwu Emperor, the founder of the Ming dynasty, did not anticipate the accession of a child emperor, making it impossible to appoint a regent to govern the country in place of a minor monarch. As a result, the Xuande Emperor&#x27;s decision was to have senior officials consult on government matters with the emperor&#x27;s grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Zhang, who effectively ruled the empire. Through her cooperation with the Grand Secretaries, state policy remained consistent until the early 1440s.

==Legacy==

The Xuande Emperor was a capable, active, and skilled emperor. Some civil officials criticized his indulgence in frequently sending eunuchs to the southern provinces seeking entertainers and virgins for his harem, and his entrusting greater authority to eunuchs— which caused problems for his successors. He saw himself as a warrior and, like the Yongle Emperor, personally led military campaigns, but his actions were relatively small (such as suppressing his uncle&#x27;s rebellion) or insignificant (such as clashes with the Mongols on the northern border). The Xuande Emperor was the last Ming emperor to actively participate in governing the state and remained impartial towards the various groups that made up the ruling elite. He relied on civil officials, but also frequently utilized eunuchs and military commanders. In contrast, later Ming emperors abandoned their role as stabilizing figures and instead indulged in palace pleasures, leaving the reins of government in the hands of officials who were often divided into rival factions or, more commonly, palace eunuchs. As a result, subsequent generations of officials viewed the Xuande era as a golden age of ideal governance, in contrast to the factional conflicts and institutional decay of their own time.

The Xuande Emperor&#x27;s reign is widely regarded by historians as the high point of the Ming era, characterized by stability and peace. This was a stark contrast to the harsh administrative purges of the Hongwu era and the civil war of the Jianwen era. Capable and often long-serving ministers and officials, under the leadership of the &quot;Three Yangs&quot; (Yang Shiqi, Yang Rong, and Yang Pu), governed the country with a level of continuity and reliability unique to the Ming era, in accordance with the Confucian ideals of wise ministerial rule led by a capable ruler. The government also made efforts to improve the lives of its people, gave up expansion in Đại Việt, and implemented administrative reforms. While the emperor may have been harsh towards officials and lenient towards high-ranking officers, this did not significantly impact the overall character of the government.

The rebellion of the emperor&#x27;s uncle confirmed to the emperor and officials that the decision to remove members of the imperial family from any influence on the military was the right one. The failure of the war in Jiaozhi and the subsequent defeat in Tumu were constant arguments used by officials against military adventures, which could potentially return power to the hands of the generals and disrupt the establishment of the Ming dynasty&#x27;s dominance in government. The Ming dynasty&#x27;s originally diverse elites, including generals, members of the imperial family, Confucian officials, and eunuchs, saw the first two groups lose their influence on the governance of the country. During the Xuande era, Confucian officials gained supremacy over the other groups and maintained it until the end of the Ming dynasty, marking the end of the early Ming period in the 1430s. Despite the significant increase in population and economy, the Ming military and political institutions remained relatively unchanged until the end of the dynasty.

<doc id="390538" wikidata="Q1353916" url="?curid=390538" title="Kähler manifold">
<text>In mathematics and especially differential geometry, a Kähler manifold is a manifold with three mutually compatible structures: a complex structure, a Riemannian structure, and a symplectic structure. The concept was first studied by Jan Arnoldus Schouten and David van Dantzig in 1930, and then introduced by Erich Kähler in 1933. The terminology has been fixed by André Weil. Kähler geometry refers to the study of Kähler manifolds, their geometry and topology, as well as the study of structures and constructions that can be performed on Kähler manifolds, such as the existence of special connections like Hermitian Yang–Mills connections, or special metrics such as Kähler–Einstein metrics.

Every smooth complex projective variety is a Kähler manifold. Hodge theory is a central part of algebraic geometry, proved using Kähler metrics.

==Definitions==
Since Kähler manifolds are equipped with several compatible structures, they can be described from different points of view:

===Symplectic viewpoint===
A Kähler manifold is a symplectic manifold formula_1 equipped with an integrable almost-complex structure formula_2 which is compatible with the symplectic form formula_3, meaning that the bilinear form
:formula_4
on the tangent space of formula_5 at each point is symmetric and positive definite (and hence a Riemannian metric on formula_5).

===Complex viewpoint===
A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold formula_5 with a Hermitian metric formula_8 whose associated 2-form formula_3 is closed. In more detail, formula_8 gives a positive definite Hermitian form on the tangent space formula_11 at each point of formula_5, and the 2-form formula_3 is defined by
:formula_14
for tangent vectors formula_15 and formula_16 (where formula_17 is the complex number formula_18). For a Kähler manifold formula_5, the Kähler form formula_3 is a real closed (1,1)-form. A Kähler manifold can also be viewed as a Riemannian manifold, with the Riemannian metric formula_21 defined by
:formula_22

Equivalently, a Kähler manifold formula_5 is a Hermitian manifold of complex dimension formula_24 such that for every point formula_25 of formula_5, there is a holomorphic coordinate chart around formula_25 in which the metric agrees with the standard metric on formula_28 to order 2 near formula_25. That is, if the chart takes formula_25 to formula_31 in formula_28, and the metric is written in these coordinates as formula_33, then
:formula_34
for all formula_35, formula_36 formula_37

Since the 2-form formula_3 is closed, it determines an element in de Rham cohomology formula_39, known as the Kähler class.

===Riemannian viewpoint===
A Kähler manifold is a Riemannian manifold formula_5 of even dimension formula_41 whose holonomy group is contained in the unitary group formula_42. Equivalently, there is a complex structure formula_2 on the tangent space of formula_5 at each point (that is, a real linear map from formula_11 to itself with formula_46) such that formula_2 preserves the metric formula_21 (meaning that formula_49) and formula_2 is preserved by parallel transport.

==Kähler potential==
A smooth real-valued function formula_51 on a complex manifold is called strictly plurisubharmonic if the real closed (1,1)-form
:formula_52
is positive, that is, a Kähler form. Here formula_53 are the Dolbeault operators. The function formula_51 is called a Kähler potential for formula_3.

Conversely, by the complex version of the Poincaré lemma, known as the local formula_56-lemma, every Kähler metric can locally be described in this way. That is, if formula_1 is a Kähler manifold, then for every point formula_25 in formula_5 there is a neighborhood formula_60 of formula_25 and a smooth real-valued function formula_51 on formula_60 such that formula_64. Here formula_51 is called a local Kähler potential for formula_3. There is no comparable way of describing a general Riemannian metric in terms of a single function.

===Space of Kähler potentials===

Whilst it is not always possible to describe a Kähler form &quot;globally&quot; using a single Kähler potential, it is possible to describe the &quot;difference&quot; of two Kähler forms this way, provided they are in the same de Rham cohomology class. This is a consequence of the formula_56-lemma from Hodge theory.

Namely, if formula_1 is a compact Kähler manifold, then the cohomology class formula_69 is called a Kähler class. Any other representative of this class, formula_70 say, differs from formula_3 by formula_72 for some one-form formula_73. The formula_56-lemma further states that this exact form formula_75 may be written as formula_76 for a smooth function formula_77. In the local discussion above, one takes the local Kähler class formula_78 on an open subset formula_79, and by the Poincaré lemma any Kähler form will locally be cohomologous to zero. Thus the local Kähler potential formula_51 is the same formula_81 for formula_78 locally.

In general if formula_83 is a Kähler class, then any other Kähler metric can be written as formula_84 for such a smooth function. This form is not automatically a positive form, so the space of Kähler potentials for the class formula_83 is defined as those positive cases, and is commonly denoted by formula_86:

:formula_87

If two Kähler potentials differ by a constant, then they define the same Kähler metric, so the space of Kähler metrics in the class formula_83 can be identified with the quotient formula_89. The space of Kähler potentials is a contractible space. In this way the space of Kähler potentials allows one to study &quot;all&quot; Kähler metrics in a given class simultaneously, and this perspective in the study of existence results for Kähler metrics.

==Kähler manifolds and volume minimizers==
For a compact Kähler manifold &quot;X&quot;, the volume of a closed complex subspace of &quot;X&quot; is determined by its homology class. In a sense, this means that the geometry of a complex subspace is bounded in terms of its topology. (This fails completely for real submanifolds.) Explicitly, Wirtinger&#x27;s formula says that
:formula_90
where &quot;Y&quot; is an &quot;r&quot;-dimensional closed complex subspace and &quot;ω&quot; is the Kähler form. Since &quot;ω&quot; is closed, this integral depends only on the class of &quot;Y&quot; in . These volumes are always positive, which expresses a strong positivity of the Kähler class &quot;ω&quot; in with respect to complex subspaces. In particular, &quot;ω&quot;&quot;n&quot; is not zero in , for a compact Kähler manifold &quot;X&quot; of complex dimension &quot;n&quot;.

A related fact is that every closed complex subspace &quot;Y&quot; of a compact Kähler manifold &quot;X&quot; is a minimal submanifold (outside its singular set). Even more: by the theory of calibrated geometry, &quot;Y&quot; minimizes volume among all (real) cycles in the same homology class.

== Kähler identities ==

As a consequence of the strong interaction between the smooth, complex, and Riemannian structures on a Kähler manifold, there are natural identities between the various operators on the complex differential forms of Kähler manifolds which do not hold for arbitrary complex manifolds. These identities relate the exterior derivative formula_91, the Dolbeault operators formula_92 and their adjoints, the Laplacians formula_93, and the &quot;Lefschetz operator&quot; formula_94 and its adjoint, the &quot;contraction operator&quot; formula_95. The identities form the basis of the analytical toolkit on Kähler manifolds, and combined with Hodge theory are fundamental in proving many important properties of Kähler manifolds and their cohomology. In particular the Kähler identities are critical in proving the Kodaira and Nakano vanishing theorems, the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, Hard Lefschetz theorem, Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations, and Hodge index theorem.

==The Laplacian on a Kähler manifold==
On a Riemannian manifold of dimension formula_24, the Laplacian on smooth formula_97-forms is defined by
formula_98
where formula_91 is the exterior derivative and formula_100, where formula_101 is the Hodge star operator. (Equivalently, formula_102 is the adjoint of formula_91 with respect to the &quot;L&quot;2 inner product on formula_97-forms with compact support.) For a Hermitian manifold formula_5, formula_91 and formula_102 are decomposed as
:formula_108
and two other Laplacians are defined:
:formula_109
If formula_5 is Kähler, the Kähler identities imply these Laplacians are all the same up to a constant:
:formula_111

These identities imply that on a Kähler manifold formula_5, 
:formula_113
where formula_114 is the space of harmonic formula_97-forms on formula_5 (forms formula_117 with formula_118) and formula_119 is the space of harmonic formula_120-forms. That is, a differential form formula_117 is harmonic if and only if each of its formula_120-components is harmonic.

Further, for a compact Kähler manifold formula_5, Hodge theory gives an interpretation of the splitting above which does not depend on the choice of Kähler metric. Namely, the cohomology formula_124 of formula_5 with complex coefficients splits as a direct sum of certain coherent sheaf cohomology groups:
:formula_126
The group on the left depends only on formula_5 as a topological space, while the groups on the right depend on formula_5 as a complex manifold. So this Hodge decomposition theorem connects topology and complex geometry for compact Kähler manifolds.

Let formula_129 be the complex vector space formula_130, which can be identified with the space formula_131 of harmonic forms with respect to a given Kähler metric. The Hodge numbers of formula_5 are defined by formula_133. The Hodge decomposition implies a decomposition of the Betti numbers of a compact Kähler manifold formula_5 in terms of its Hodge numbers:
:formula_135
The Hodge numbers of a compact Kähler manifold satisfy several identities. The Hodge symmetry formula_136 holds because the Laplacian formula_137 is a real operator, and so formula_138. The identity formula_139 can be proved using that the Hodge star operator gives an isomorphism formula_140. It also follows from Serre duality.

==Topology of compact Kähler manifolds==
A simple consequence of Hodge theory is that every odd Betti number &quot;b&quot;2&quot;a&quot;+1 of a compact Kähler manifold is even, by Hodge symmetry. This is not true for compact complex manifolds in general, as shown by the example of the Hopf surface, which is diffeomorphic to and hence has .

The &quot;Kähler package&quot; is a collection of further restrictions on the cohomology of compact Kähler manifolds, building on Hodge theory. The results include the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, the hard Lefschetz theorem, and the Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations. A related result is that every compact Kähler manifold is formal in the sense of rational homotopy theory.

The question of which groups can be fundamental groups of compact Kähler manifolds, called Kähler groups, is wide open. Hodge theory gives many restrictions on the possible Kähler groups. The simplest restriction is that the abelianization of a Kähler group must have even rank, since the Betti number &quot;b&quot;1 of a compact Kähler manifold is even. (For example, the integers Z cannot be the fundamental group of a compact Kähler manifold.) Extensions of the theory such as non-abelian Hodge theory give further restrictions on which groups can be Kähler groups.

Without the Kähler condition, the situation is simple: Clifford Taubes showed that every finitely presented group arises as the fundamental group of some compact complex manifold of dimension 3. (Conversely, the fundamental group of any closed manifold is finitely presented.)

==Characterizations of complex projective varieties and compact Kähler manifolds==
The Kodaira embedding theorem characterizes smooth complex projective varieties among all compact Kähler manifolds. Namely, a compact complex manifold &quot;X&quot; is projective if and only if there is a Kähler form &quot;ω&quot; on &quot;X&quot; whose class in is in the image of the integral cohomology group . (Because a positive multiple of a Kähler form is a Kähler form, it is equivalent to say that &quot;X&quot; has a Kähler form whose class in comes from .) Equivalently, &quot;X&quot; is projective if and only if there is a holomorphic line bundle &quot;L&quot; on &quot;X&quot; with a hermitian metric whose curvature form ω is positive (since ω is then a Kähler form that represents the first Chern class of &quot;L&quot; in ). The Kähler form &quot;ω&quot; that satisfies these conditions (that is, Kähler form &quot;ω&quot; is an integral differential form) is also called the Hodge form, and the Kähler metric at this time is called the Hodge metric. The compact Kähler manifolds with Hodge metric are also called Hodge manifolds.

Many properties of Kähler manifolds hold in the slightly greater generality of formula_56-manifolds, that is compact complex manifolds for which the formula_56-lemma holds. In particular the Bott–Chern cohomology is an alternative to the Dolbeault cohomology of a compact complex manifolds, and they are isomorphic if and only if the manifold satisfies the formula_56-lemma, and in particular agree when the manifold is Kähler. In general the kernel of the natural map from Bott–Chern cohomology to Dolbeault cohomology contains information about the failure of the manifold to be Kähler.

Every compact complex curve is projective, but in complex dimension at least 2, there are many compact Kähler manifolds that are not projective; for example, most compact complex tori are not projective. One may ask whether every compact Kähler manifold can at least be deformed (by continuously varying the complex structure) to a smooth projective variety. Kunihiko Kodaira&#x27;s work on the classification of surfaces implies that every compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension 2 can indeed be deformed to a smooth projective variety. Claire Voisin found, however, that this fails in dimensions at least 4. She constructed a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension 4 that is not even homotopy equivalent to any smooth complex projective variety.

One can also ask for a characterization of compact Kähler manifolds among all compact complex manifolds. In complex dimension 2, Kodaira and Yum-Tong Siu showed that a compact complex surface has a Kähler metric if and only if its first Betti number is even. An alternative proof of this result which does not require the hard case-by-case study using the classification of compact complex surfaces was provided independently by Buchdahl and Lamari. Thus &quot;Kähler&quot; is a purely topological property for compact complex surfaces. Hironaka&#x27;s example shows, however, that this fails in dimensions at least 3. In more detail, the example is a 1-parameter family of smooth compact complex 3-folds such that most fibers are Kähler (and even projective), but one fiber is not Kähler. Thus a compact Kähler manifold can be diffeomorphic to a non-Kähler complex manifold.

==Kähler–Einstein manifolds==

A Kähler manifold is called Kähler–Einstein if it has constant Ricci curvature. Equivalently, the Ricci curvature tensor is equal to a constant λ times the metric tensor, Ric = &quot;λg&quot;. The reference to Einstein comes from general relativity, which asserts in the absence of mass that spacetime is a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold with zero Ricci curvature. See the article on Einstein manifolds for more details.

Although Ricci curvature is defined for any Riemannian manifold, it plays a special role in Kähler geometry: the Ricci curvature of a Kähler manifold &quot;X&quot; can be viewed as a real closed (1,1)-form that represents &quot;c&quot;1(&quot;X&quot;) (the first Chern class of the tangent bundle) in . It follows that a compact Kähler–Einstein manifold &quot;X&quot; must have canonical bundle &quot;K&quot;&quot;X&quot; either anti-ample, homologically trivial, or ample, depending on whether the Einstein constant λ is positive, zero, or negative. Kähler manifolds of those three types are called Fano, Calabi–Yau, or with ample canonical bundle (which implies general type), respectively. By the Kodaira embedding theorem, Fano manifolds and manifolds with ample canonical bundle are automatically projective varieties.

Shing-Tung Yau proved the Calabi conjecture: every smooth projective variety with ample canonical bundle has a Kähler–Einstein metric (with constant negative Ricci curvature), and every Calabi–Yau manifold has a Kähler–Einstein metric (with zero Ricci curvature). These results are important for the classification of algebraic varieties, with applications such as the Miyaoka–Yau inequality for varieties with ample canonical bundle and the Beauville–Bogomolov decomposition for Calabi–Yau manifolds.

By contrast, not every smooth Fano variety has a Kähler–Einstein metric (which would have constant positive Ricci curvature). However, Xiuxiong Chen, Simon Donaldson, and Song Sun proved the Yau–Tian–Donaldson conjecture: a smooth Fano variety has a Kähler–Einstein metric if and only if it is K-stable, a purely algebro-geometric condition.

In situations where there cannot exist a Kähler–Einstein metric, it is possible to study mild generalizations including constant scalar curvature Kähler metrics and extremal Kähler metrics. When a Kähler–Einstein metric can exist, these broader generalizations are automatically Kähler–Einstein.

==Holomorphic sectional curvature==
The deviation of a Riemannian manifold &quot;X&quot; from the standard metric on Euclidean space is measured by sectional curvature, which is a real number associated to any real 2-plane in the tangent space of &quot;X&quot; at a point. For example, the sectional curvature of the standard metric on CP&quot;n&quot; (for ) varies between 1/4 and 1 at every point. For a Hermitian manifold (for example, a Kähler manifold), the holomorphic sectional curvature means the sectional curvature restricted to complex lines in the tangent space. This behaves more simply, in that CP&quot;n&quot; has holomorphic sectional curvature equal to 1 everywhere. At the other extreme, the open unit ball in C&quot;n&quot; has a complete Kähler metric with holomorphic sectional curvature equal to −1. (With this metric, the ball is also called complex hyperbolic space.)

The holomorphic sectional curvature is intimately related to the complex geometry of the underlying complex manifold. It is an elementary consequence of the Ahlfors Schwarz lemma that if formula_1 is a Hermitian manifold with a Hermitian metric of negative holomorphic sectional curvature (bounded above by a negative constant), then it is Brody hyperbolic (i.e., every holomorphic map formula_145 is constant). If &quot;X&quot; happens to be compact, then this is equivalent to the manifold being Kobayashi hyperbolic.

On the other hand, if formula_1 is a compact Kähler manifold with a Kähler metric of positive holomorphic sectional curvature, Yang Xiaokui showed that &quot;X&quot; is rationally connected. 

A remarkable feature of complex geometry is that holomorphic sectional curvature decreases on complex submanifolds. (The same goes for a more general concept, holomorphic bisectional curvature.) For example, every complex submanifold of C&quot;n&quot; (with the induced metric from C&quot;n&quot;) has holomorphic sectional curvature ≤ 0.

For holomorphic maps between Hermitian manifolds, the holomorphic sectional curvature is not strong enough to control the target curvature term appearing in the Schwarz lemma second-order estimate. This motivated the consideration of the real bisectional curvature, introduced by Xiaokui Yang and Fangyang Zheng. This also appears in the work of Man-Chun Lee and Jeffrey Streets under the name complex curvature operator.

==Examples==
#Complex space C&quot;n&quot; with the standard Hermitian metric is a Kähler manifold.
#A compact complex torus C&quot;n&quot;/Λ (Λ a full lattice) inherits a flat metric from the Euclidean metric on C&quot;n&quot;, and is therefore a compact Kähler manifold.
#Every Riemannian metric on an oriented 2-manifold is Kähler. (Indeed, its holonomy group is contained in the rotation group SO(2), which is equal to the unitary group U(1).) In particular, an oriented Riemannian 2-manifold is a Riemann surface in a canonical way; this is known as the existence of isothermal coordinates. Conversely, every Riemann surface is Kähler since the Kähler form of any Hermitian metric is closed for dimensional reasons.
#There is a standard choice of Kähler metric on complex projective space CP&quot;n&quot;, the Fubini–Study metric. One description involves the unitary group , the group of linear automorphisms of C&quot;n&quot;+1 that preserve the standard Hermitian form. The Fubini–Study metric is the unique Riemannian metric on CP&quot;n&quot; (up to a positive multiple) that is invariant under the action of on CP&quot;n&quot;. One natural generalization of CP&quot;n&quot; is provided by the Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type, such as Grassmannians. The natural Kähler metric on a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type has sectional curvature ≥ 0.
#The induced metric on a complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold is Kähler. In particular, any Stein manifold (embedded in C&quot;n&quot;) or smooth projective algebraic variety (embedded in CP&quot;n&quot;) is Kähler. This is a large class of examples.
#The open unit ball B in C&quot;n&quot; has a complete Kähler metric called the Bergman metric, with holomorphic sectional curvature equal to −1. A natural generalization of the ball is provided by the Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type, such as the Siegel upper half space. Every Hermitian symmetric space &quot;X&quot; of noncompact type is isomorphic to a bounded domain in some C&quot;n&quot;, and the Bergman metric of &quot;X&quot; is a complete Kähler metric with sectional curvature ≤ 0.
#Every K3 surface is Kähler (by Siu).

<text>Dulwich Picture Gallery is an art gallery in Dulwich, south London. It opened to the public in 1817 and was designed by the Regency architect Sir John Soane. His design was recognized for its innovative and influential method of illumination for viewing the art. It is the oldest public art gallery in England and was made an independent charitable trust in 1994. Until then, the gallery was part of the College of God&#x27;s Gift, a charitable foundation established by the actor, entrepreneur and philanthropist Edward Alleyn in the early 17th century. The acquisition of artworks by its founders and bequests from its many patrons resulted in Dulwich Picture Gallery housing one of the country&#x27;s finest collections of Old Masters, especially rich in French, Italian and Spanish Baroque paintings, and in British portraits from the Tudor era to the 19th century.

The Dulwich Picture Gallery and its mausoleum are listed Grade II* on the National Heritage List for England. The mausoleum is for founders of the collection, Francis Bourgeois and Noël Desenfans.

==History==

===Early history of the gallery===

Edward Alleyn (1566–1626) was an actor who became an entrepreneur in Elizabethan theatre. His commercial interests in the Rose and Fortune Theatres (a major competitor to the Globe Theatre), gave him sufficient wealth to acquire the Manor of Dulwich in 1605. He founded a college at Dulwich, the College of God&#x27;s Gift, and endowed it with his estate. It was a school for boys and next to it were almshouses for the local poor. The college became three separate beneficiary schools—Dulwich College, Alleyn&#x27;s School, and James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, named after an early 18th-century headmaster. The college, the attached almshouses and chapel survive next to the gallery on Gallery Road, although its exterior has undergone extensive renovation.

Alleyn bequeathed the college of a collection of works including portraits of the kings and queens of England. The college retained connections with the theatre and in 1686, the actor William Cartwright (1606–1686) bequeathed a collection of 239 pictures, of which 80 are now identifiable at Dulwich. In the 18th century, the collection was displayed on the first floor of the wing of the Old College. It attracted few additions during this period, and recorded descriptions of the gallery suggest disappointment and apathy from its visitors. The art historian and Whig politician Horace Walpole wrote that he saw &quot;a hundred mouldy portraits among apostles sibyls and kings of England&quot;.

===Later history – Bourgeois, Desenfans and Sir John Soane===

The Dulwich collection was improved in size and quality by Sir Francis Bourgeois (1753–1811), originally from Switzerland, and his business partner, Frenchman Noël Desenfans (1744–1807). Their involvement saw the Gallery make significant steps towards its present state, and they are credited as founders of Dulwich Picture Gallery. They ran an art dealership in London and in 1790 were commissioned by the king of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Stanisław August Poniatowski, to assemble a national collection for Poland to encourage fine arts in his country. Desenfans had lobbied the British Government to create a similar British national collection and offered to contribute to it, but was unenthusiastically received. Touring around Europe buying fine art, Bourgeois and Desenfans took five years to assemble the collection, but by 1795 the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had been partitioned and no longer existed.

Bourgeois and Desenfans attempted to sell the collection but were unsuccessful. Instead, they sold small pieces to fund the purchase of other important works and kept the collection in Desenfans&#x27; house in Charlotte Street. After the death of Desenfans in 1807, Bourgeois inherited the collection. He commissioned Sir John Soane to design and construct a mausoleum at Desenfans&#x27; house, but was unable to secure the freehold. Bourgeois bequeathed his collection to the College of God&#x27;s Gift on the advice of the actor John Philip Kemble, a friend of both dealers. Bourgeois left instructions in his will for the construction of a gallery in Dulwich, designed by Soane, in which to display the collection. It was next to the original college buildings by the chapel. He also left £2,000 for construction costs and £4,000 was contributed by Desenfan&#x27;s widow.

The gallery was opened to students of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1815, two years before the official opening to the public, the delay due to a problem with the gallery&#x27;s heating system. It became a popular venue for copyists from London schools of art. Its collection was frequented by many cultural figures over the next hundred years, many of whom first visited as students, including John Constable, William Etty, Joseph Mallord William Turner, and later Vincent van Gogh. Charles Dickens mentions Dulwich Picture Gallery in his novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, as Samuel Pickwick, the novel&#x27;s protagonist, is a visitor to the gallery in his retirement.

===Modern history===
In the early hours of 31 December 1966, eight paintings were stolen, three by Rembrandt, &quot;A Girl at the Window&quot;, a version of&quot; Portrait of Titus&quot; and his &quot;Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III&quot;, a fellow artist, three by Rubens, &quot;Three Women with a Cornucopia&quot;, &quot;St. Barbara and The Three Graces&quot;; and one, &quot;A Lady Playing on the Clavicord&quot; by Gerrit Dou and &quot;Susannah and the Elders&quot; by Adam Elsheimer. They were worth at least £3 million but a reward of just £1,000 was offered for their return. Within a few days all the paintings were recovered after an investigation led by Detective Superintendent Charles Hewett, who had previously investigated suspected serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams. Michael Hall, an unemployed ambulance driver, was the only one of the thieves caught and was sentenced to five years in prison.

Rembrandt&#x27;s small early &quot;Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III&quot; (1632) has been stolen and recovered four times and is listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the most frequently stolen artwork in the world. Last stolen in 1983, it was recovered from a left-luggage office in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1986; returned anonymously; found on the back of a bicycle; and discovered under a bench in a graveyard in Streatham, south London. Since 2010, the painting has been guarded by an upgraded security system. In November 2019, During the &quot;Rembrandt&#x27;s Light&quot; exhibition featuring loans works from the Louvre in Paris and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, thieves attempted to steal two of the paintings. The attempt was unsuccessful.

In 1995 a major reorganisation of the historic Alleyn&#x27;s College charity resulted in the reconstitution of Dulwich Picture Gallery as an independent registered charity.

The gallery marked its bicentenary in 2017. As part of the celebrations the Gallery partnered with the London Festival of Architecture to hold a competition for emerging architects to create a &#x27;Dulwich Pavilion&#x27;, a temporary events structure to be built in the Gallery&#x27;s historic grounds during the summer of 2017. The competition was won by London-based architecture practice IF_DO.

In June–September 2019, the Dulwich hosted the first major exhibition of the works of the Grosvenor School in a public art gallery outside Australia, which was critically well received.

The Gallery reopened in May 2021 after 14 months of pandemic closure with a complete rehang of the collection and the exhibition &quot;Unearthed: Photography’s Roots&quot;.

In spring 2023, the Gallery hosted the first major UK exhibition of the Impressionist Berthe Morisot since 1950. 

===Donors===
The gallery attracted donors from its earliest days. In 1835 William Linley (1771–1835)—last of a musical and theatrical family (many of whom had connections to Dulwich College) and brother-in-law to playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan—bequeathed his collection of family portraits to the gallery. Among these paintings were works by Thomas Gainsborough, Archer James Oliver, James Lonsdale and Thomas Lawrence.

The portraitist and Royal Academician William Beechey (1753–1839) donated a picture of the gallery&#x27;s founder Bourgeois he had painted on the back of a picture by Joshua Reynolds in 1836 adding two images to the collection, although only one can be shown at a time. In 2012, the side of the canvas on display is by Reynolds.

British portrait art became better represented due to the benefaction of Charles Fairfax Murray, a Pre-Raphaelite painter, collector and dealer. A group of 40 pictures were donated by Murray in 1911 and others followed in 1915 and 1917–18.

==Gallery design==

Dulwich Picture Gallery&#x27;s design and architecture comprising a series of interlinked rooms lit by natural light through overhead skylights has been the primary influence on art gallery design ever since. Soane designed the sky lights to illuminate the paintings indirectly. Soane&#x27;s design was unrelated to traditional architectural practice or schools of architecture. Instead of constructing a facade with the stucco porticos favoured by many contemporary architects, he opted to use uninterrupted raw brick, a feature subsequently adopted by many 20th-century art galleries. The architect Philip Johnson said &quot;Soane has taught us how to display paintings&quot;.

Before Soane settled on his final design, he proposed a number of other ideas around a quadrangle belonging to the Alleyn&#x27;s charitable foundation to the south of the college buildings. The schemes proved too ambitious and only the gallery was built, conceived as one wing of the quadrangle. The mausoleum was Soane&#x27;s idea, as Bourgeois had merely indicated a desire to be buried in the college chapel. Soane recalled Bourgeois&#x27; desire to construct a mausoleum in Desenfan&#x27;s home and his design was axiomatic to that of the Charlotte Street house. Bourgeois and Desenfans, along with Desenfans&#x27; wife, who died in 1815, are buried in the gallery&#x27;s mausoleum. Alms houses constructed by Soane along the west side of the gallery were converted into exhibition space by Charles Barry Jr. in 1880 and an eastward extension was built to designs by E. S. Hall between 1908 and 1938.

On 12 July 1944, during World War II, the mausoleum and west wing galleries were badly damaged by a German V1 flying bomb and bones were scattered across the lawn in front of the gallery. The three sarcophagi in the mausoleum now contain approximately a skeleton each. The buildings were refurbished by Austin Vernon and Partners and re-opened by the Queen Mother on 27 April 1953.

A modernist cafe, education rooms, disabled access and lecture theatre by Rick Mather were added in 1999. At the same time parts of Soane&#x27;s original design were restored and the latest refurbishment was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 25 May 2000.

In 2023, the gallery announced plans for a £4.9 million redevelopment designed by the architects Carmody Groarke, encompassing a new sculpture garden in the southern portion of the site and a new building for school and family activities.

<text>Krzeszowice () is a town in southern Poland, situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. As of 2004, its population was 9,993. Krzeszowice belongs to &quot;Kraków Metropolitan Area&quot;, and lies 25 kilometers west of the center of the city of Kraków. The town has a rail station, on a major route from Kraków to Katowice, and lies along National Road Nr. 79, which goes from Warsaw to Bytom. In 1928–1966 the town had the status of a spa. Krzeszowice has a sports club called &quot;Świt&quot;, founded in 1923.

Krzeszowice is located in southern part of the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland, with numerous caves and valleys in the area. In 1981, when the &quot;Complex of Jura Landscape Parks&quot; was created, three parks from the gmina of Krzeszowice were added to it (&quot;Rudnia Landscape Park, Tenczynek Landscape Park&quot; and &quot;Kraków Valleys Landscape Park&quot;). In 2008, it was selected with 19 villages of Europe - Germany, Poland, Italy and Spain - for the Spanish documentary film &quot;Villages of Europe&quot; Pueblos de Europa, produced by Juan Frutos.

== History ==
First mention of Krzeszowice comes from 1286, when Bishop of Kraków, Paweł z Przemankowa, allowed a man named Fryczek Freton to locate the village of &quot;Cressouicy&quot;. By 1337, Krzeszowice already had a wooden church of St. Martin. In the mid-15th century, it had a school and a public house. In 1555, Krzeszowice belonged to Stanisław Tęczynski, then it was owned by several noble families - the Sieniawski family, Opaliński family, Czartoryski family, Lubomirski family and, since 1816, the Potocki family.

In the early 17th century, the advantages of local mineral water were discovered by Krzeszowice parish priest, reverend Bernard Bocheński, who mentioned it in the 1625 parish records. In 1778, Prince August Czartoryski opened here first baths, and soon afterwards, patients began visiting Krzeszowice. In 1783–1786, the &quot;Vauxhall Palace&quot; was built, and in 1819, the &quot;Green Bath&quot; was opened. Krzeszowice began to prosper, in 1809–1815 and 1855–1867, the town was the seat of a county. In 1815–1846, Krzeszowice belonged to the Free City of Kraków, and to Austria in 1846-1918 within the Grand Duchy of Cracow, Chrzanow &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaft&quot;.

A hospital was opened here in 1829, a shelter for the poor in 1843, and in 1844, neo-Gothic church was built. In 1847 Krzeszowice received a rail station, along the newly built route from Kraków to Mysłowice. Local residents took part in the Kraków Uprising, and helped Polish rebels from Russian-controlled Congress Poland, during the January Uprising. In 1850–1855, the &quot;Potocki Palace&quot; was built, in the Italian Renaissance style, together with English garden. The palace with all its details was not completed until 1870.

By 1910, the population of Krzeszowice was 2619, out of which Jews made 18%. The town continued to develop, with several new enterprises opened here in the late 19th and early 20th century. On December 3, 1924, Krzeszowice was officially incorporated as a town. New districts and blocks of flats were built, and by 1931, the population grew to 3,391. During World War II Krzeszowice belonged to the General Government. The &quot;Potocki Palace&quot; was restored by polish slave laborer by the order of Nazis and renamed by Germans into &quot;Haus Kressendorf&quot;, becoming the summer residence of Hans Frank. Almost all Jewish citizens were murdered in the Holocaust. The German occupation of Krzeszowice ended on 19 January 1945.

<text>Dobczyce is a town in southern Poland, situated since 1999 in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship (previously in Kraków Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998). As of December 2021, the town has a population of 6,388.

There is a large dam with Lake Dobczyce on the Raba river, and a partially rebuilt 14th-century Dobczyce Castle, with ruins of a 14th-century defensive wall - which is open for tourists. Dobczyce is also the name of a small part of Bobrowniki Małe, a village in Lesser Poland.

Dobczyce received its Magdeburg rights town charter probably in 1310, during the reign of Władysław Łokietek. The town was famous for its castle, where Jan Długosz liked to stay and work on his chronicles. Here, in 1450, Polish astronomer and dean of Kraków Academy Leonard Vitreatoris (Leonhard von Dobschütz) was born. Dobczyce enjoyed several royal privileges, allowing its residents to buy salt from nearby Wieliczka. The town was a local center of cloth and wool making, but the period of prosperity ended during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660). After the Partitions of Poland, Dobczyce was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and from 1772 to 1918 belonged to Galicia. On the main square there is a 19th-century parish church.

<doc id="390546" wikidata="Q301924" url="?curid=390546" title="Skawina">
<text>Skawina is a town in southern Poland with 27,328 inhabitants (2008). Situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Kraków Voivodeship (1975–1998). The town is located on the Skawinka river, in close proximity to the city of Kraków. Its population (as for December 31, 2010) was 23,761, and the area of the town is 20,50 km2. One of the most interesting historic buildings in Skawina is a Renaissance palace, built in the mid-16th century by Paweł Korytko. The name of the town probably comes from the Skawinka river.

==History==

In the late 13th century, three villages existed here: &quot;Babice Nowe&quot;, &quot;Babice Stare&quot; and &quot;Pisary&quot;. They belonged to the Tyniec Benedictine Abbey. In the Middle Ages, the Skawinka marked for a while the boundary between Silesia and Lesser Poland, which resulted in construction of a defensive gord, which protected the city of Kraków from the south. On May 22, 1364, King Kazimierz Wielki granted Magdeburg rights to Skawina, and a few years later, the parish church of Holy Spirit was funded here. Skawina was the seat of a wójt, and remained in the hands of the Benedictine monks. It was administratively located in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. The town had a defensive wall and a castle, which was the residence of the wójt. In 1509, Skawina burned in a fire, but the town was quickly rebuilt and enjoyed the prosperity of the Polish Golden Age. Good times ended in the Swedish invasion of Poland, when Swedish and Transilvanian armies destroyed Skawina, reducing its population by 50%. After the First Partition of Poland, Skawina became part of Austrian province of Galicia (1772). The town remained poor and backward until the second half of the 19th century, when Skawina became a railroad hub, with three lines, to Kraków, Sucha Beskidzka, and Oświęcim. A brewery was built and new businesses were opened.
In the Second Polish Republic Skawina belonged to the Kraków Voivodeship. On September 6, 1939 the first Wehrmacht troops entered the town, and the German occupation lasted until January 23, 1945. During this time, the Germans murdered nearly all of the town&#x27;s pre-war population of around 300 Jews. Some were murdered nearby while others were rounded up and sent to the Belzec extermination camp where they were immediately gassed. A few were sent to forced labor camps near Płaszów where most were later murdered too. Those who hid from the roundup were later shot in the town.

The Communist government of People&#x27;s Republic of Poland decided that Skawina would become a center of heavy industry. In 1954, the &quot;Skawina Aluminum Works&quot; (&quot;Huta Aluminium Skawina&quot;) were opened, and in 1961 the Skawina Power Station (&quot;Elektrownia Skawina&quot;) went on line. The aluminium works were closed in 1981 due to the widespread pollution they caused. The growth of industry resulted in an influx of new residents and the construction of several apartment blocks in new districts of the town.

== Twin Towns – Sister Cities ==
Skawina is twinned with:

* Civitanova Marche in Italy 
* Roztoky in Czech Republic 

== Sports ==
Skawina is home to sports club &quot;Skawinka&quot;, founded in 1922.

<text>Skała is a town in southern Poland, situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Kraków Voivodeship (1975–1998). On December 31, 2010, its population was 3,646.

Skala is one of the oldest towns in Lesser Poland. In the early 13th century, it was a defensive gord, known as Scala and Magna Schala. Its name (the Polish word &quot;skała&quot; means rock in English) probably comes from a rocky hill above the Pradnik river valley.

==History==
During the period known as Fragmentation of Poland (1148–1320), Skala was the object of frequent clashes between the Piast dynasty princes. In 1228, a battle took place here between the army of Silesian prince Henry I the Bearded and Mazovian duke Konrad I of Masovia. The Silesians won, forcing Mazovian units to retreat from Lesser Poland. Skala received Środa Śląska rights on November 10, 1267, due to efforts of Salomea, the sister of duke Boleslaw V the Chaste. The town itself was located in the area of earlier village of Stańków (Stankoy), and became home to a monastery of the Order of Poor Ladies, who came here in the 1260s.

In the late Middle Ages Skała prospered, due to a convenient location on a merchant route from Kraków to Greater Poland. The town belonged to Kraków Voivodeship, and was a local center of trade, with several guilds and a brewery, whose beer was popular in Kraków. The town was famous for its shoemakers and butchers, who delivered their produce to the markets at Kraków. Skała burned in several fires (1611, 1737, 1763, 1810, 1914), and in 1580, its population was 218. In the year 1596, there were 92 houses at Skała, and a school. Like almost all towns in Lesser Poland, Skała was destroyed during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660).

In 1794, after the Battle of Racławice, Tadeusz Kościuszko designed Skała as a fortified camp, protecting northern approaches to the city of Kraków. On May 18, 1794, Prussian Army attacked and captured Skała. After the Partitions of Poland, the town briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire, and in 1815 – 1915, it was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. As a result, the town was cut off from Kraków, which remained part of Austrian Galicia. Due to the proximity of the sealed border, the development of Skała was stopped for more than 100 years, as both Russian and Austrian governments did not promote mutual trade.

During the January Uprising, several skirmishes between Russian troops and Polish rebels took place in the area of Skała. In the nearby Ojców a Polish camp was created, under Marian Langiewicz. On March 5, 1863, a battle took place at a Skała cemetery. As a result, in 1870 Russian authorities stripped Skała of its town charter. In the late 19th century the population of the village was 2,823, with 12% Jewish. In the first months of World War I, heavy fighting between Russians and Austrians took place here.

In the Second Polish Republic, Skała belonged to Kielce Voivodeship, with the population of 3593 (as for 1921). The village was captured and burned by the Wehrmacht on September 6, 1939 (see Invasion of Poland). A ghetto was established for the Skała Jews; besides executions the town Jews were deported to the ghettos of Słomniki and Wolbrom. During World War II, Skała was an important center of Polish resistance, in July 1944, the Home Army units fought the Germans in several skirmishes.

After the war, Skała remained a village until 1987. The town retains its medieval urban shape, with a large market square in the middle, and a stone monument of Saint Florian (ca. 1800). Skała is the seat of a gmina, and has a late Baroque church (18th century), with a wooden bell tower (1765).

<text>Proszowice is a town in southern Poland, situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in Kraków Voivodeship (1975–1998). Its population numbers 6,206 inhabitants (2004). It is the capital of Proszowice County, and the town is located some 25 kilometers northeast of Kraków, on the right bank of the Szreniawa river. Proszowice received its Magdeburg rights charter in 1358. Proszowice has a sports club &quot;Proszowianka&quot;, established in 1916.

First mention about the village of Proszowice comes from 1222. The origin of its name is not known, probably the village was named after a knight named &quot;Proszkomir&quot;, who lived here. By 1240, Proszowice already had a brick church of St. John the Baptist. The village was privately owned, and in the mid-14th century it became royal property of King Kazimierz Wielki, who granted it town charter in 1358. The King greatly contributed to the development of Proszowice, building here a palace, which for some time was one of the royal residences (later on, its role was taken on by the Niepołomice Castle). Proszowice prospered due to several royal privileges. A number of artisans lived here, there was a parish school, and the period from the early 15th century to the early 17th century is regarded as &quot;Golden Age&quot; of the town, which was one of the most important centers of Kraków Voivodeship; here sejmiks took place. King Kazimierz Jagiellończyk initiated the construction of a new church, which was finished in 1454 and was among most impressive Gothic churches in Lesser Poland. Here, Stańczyk, the legendary court jester was born, and in the 16th century, Proszowice became one of centers of Protestant Reformation. All Catholic churches in the area were turned into Calvinist or Polish Brethren prayer houses, but later on, the Counter-Reformation prevailed. In 1616, the town was almost completely burned in a fire. Like almost all towns of Lesser Poland, Proszowice was destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1660).

After Partitions of Poland, Proszowice first belonged to the Habsburg Empire, but in 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During January Uprising, several skirmishes took place in the area of the town, and as a punishment, the Russians reduced Proszowice to the status of a village (1869). In 1923, already in Kielce Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic, Proszowice regained its town charter. In 1999 the town became the seat of a county.

The center of Proszowice is of typical medieval shape, with a market square and streets radiating from it. Houses in the market square, however, are modern, most of them were built in the 20th century. Once there was a town hall, which was dismantled in the mid-19th century. Local parish church was first erected in the 13th century, during the reign of Prince Bolesław V the Chaste. The first church burned between 1306 and 1308. New complex was built in 1325, and most likely, it burned in a fire in 1407. Third parish church was completed in 1454. It was partly destroyed after a storm in May 1824, when one of the walls collapsed, together with the Gothic vault. The reconstruction took 12 years.

<text>Myślenice is a town in southern Poland situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship, 30 km south of Kraków. The town is divided into six districts. The most popular of them, Zarabie, is a famous tourist destination. It is located behind the Raba river (Zarabie meaning &quot;Beyond the (River) Raba&quot;), next to Chełm district on the slope of the hill of the same name, where is a view tower and a landscape park and ski lifts.
Myślenice is a city located in the tectonic window area, between the Dalin, Chełm and Uklejna hills. The city is also located on the border of two Beskids (in the south) and the foothills (in the north). From the western bank of the Raba River these are Maków Beskids and Wieliczka Foothills while on the eastern bank of the river - Island Beskids and Wiśnicz Foothills.

Myślenice has a direct and very convenient bus connection with Kraków however there is no train station in the city.

==History==

First mentions of Myślenice come from the years 1253–1258. At that time, it was a defensive settlement, with a castle and fortifications, designed to protect Kraków from the south. In 1342, Myślenice received its Magdeburg rights town charter, and it started to develop into a local commercial center. Among visitors who came here, were Mikolaj Rej, who wrote part of his &quot;Life of an Honest Man&quot; during his stay there; King Władysław II Jagiełło and Queen Jadwiga; German emperor Sigismund; and other personalities. In 1557, Myślenice came under the jurisdiction of Kraków castellans, who were much more concerned with their city. The town began to decline, and it was destroyed in the deluge. In 1772 (see Partitions of Poland), Myślenice was annexed by Austria, and until 1918, it belonged to the province of Galicia. After World War I, the town became part of the Second Polish Republic. On 22 January 1945, Myślenice was liberated by the troops of 38th Army of the 4th Ukrainian Front. Between 1975-1998 the city was part of the Kraków Voivodeship.

<doc id="390552" wikidata="Q1281172" url="?curid=390552" title="Słomniki">
<text>Słomniki is a town in southern Poland, situated in the Lesser Poland Voivodeship. Słomniki lies north of Kraków, among the hills of Lesser Poland Upland. On December 31, 2010, its population was 4,365, and the town is a center of commerce and services for the local agricultural area. Its name probably comes from a Medieval guild called &quot;szłomiarze&quot; or &quot;szłomniki&quot;, who manufactured helmets for royal knights.

The town has two rail stations (&quot;Słomniki&quot; and &quot;Słomniki Miasto&quot;), on a major electrified double track railway from Kraków to Warsaw. Słomniki is also served by the &quot;Kraków Transit Authority&quot; (&quot;MPK Kraków&quot;), with bus line 222 reaching it from Nowa Huta. The town has several schools, house of culture, cinema, library and &quot;Museum of Słomniki Land&quot;. Its sports club &quot;KS Słomniczanka&quot; was founded in 1923, and currently has football and volleyball departments.

==History==

The village of Słomniki was first mentioned in 1287, as a hunting settlement in the middle of dense forests. At that time, it belonged to Cistercian monks, and was located along a merchant route from Bochnia and Wieliczka to Greater Poland. In the 13th century, Lesser Poland suffered from several Mongol raids (see Mongol invasion of Poland), in which Słomniki was also destroyed. In 1358 King Casimir III the Great granted Słomniki Magdeburg rights charter, and medieval style market square was fashioned, which still exists. It was administratively located in the Kraków Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. The town developed, and several Polish rulers visited it in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1554, Słomniki became one of main centers of Protestant Reformation, when a Calvinist temple was opened here. In 1564, the Polish Reformed Church synod took place in Słomniki. Like most towns in Lesser Poland, Słomniki was completely destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, and the period of prosperity ended.

During the Kościuszko Uprising, Polish units gathered in Słomniki after the Battle of Racławice. On April 6, 1794, at Słomniki market square, Józef Zajączek and Antoni Madaliński were promoted to the rank of general. After the Partitions of Poland, Słomniki briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire. After the Polish victory in the Austro-Polish War of 1809, it became part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. Following the duchy&#x27;s dissolution, the town was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. The town was a major center of the January Uprising, for which it was stripped of its charter (1870), remaining a village until 1917. In the interwar period (1918–1939), Słomniki belonged to Kielce Voivodeship in reborn Poland.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the village was occupied by Germany until 1945. The occupiers operated a forced labour camp for Jews in the town.

Major attraction of the town is Romanesque Revival Corpus Christi church (1888–1893).

If the space is a metric space, for example a Euclidean space, then an element of is an isolated point of if there exists an open ball around that contains only finitely many elements of .
A point set that is made up only of isolated points is called a discrete set or discrete point set (see also discrete space).

== Related notions ==
Any discrete subset of Euclidean space must be countable, since the isolation of each of its points together with the fact that rationals are dense in the reals means that the points of may be mapped injectively onto a set of points with rational coordinates, of which there are only countably many. However, not every countable set is discrete, of which the rational numbers under the usual Euclidean metric are the canonical example. 

A set with no isolated point is said to be &quot;dense-in-itself&quot; (every neighbourhood of a point contains other points of the set). A closed set with no isolated point is called a &quot;perfect set&quot; (it contains all its limit points and no isolated points).

The number of isolated points is a topological invariant, i.e. if two topological spaces are homeomorphic, the number of isolated points in each is equal.

==Examples==

===Standard examples===

Topological spaces in the following three examples are considered as subspaces of the real line with the standard topology.

* For the set formula_1 the point 0 is an isolated point.
* For the set formula_2 each of the points is an isolated point, but is not an isolated point because there are other points in as close to as desired.
* The set formula_3 of natural numbers is a discrete set.
In the topological space formula_4 with topology formula_5 the element is an isolated point, even though formula_6 belongs to the closure of formula_7 (and is therefore, in some sense, &quot;close&quot; to ). Such a situation is not possible in a Hausdorff space.

The Morse lemma states that non-degenerate critical points of certain functions are isolated.

===Two counter-intuitive examples===
Consider the set of points in the real interval such that every digit of their binary representation fulfills the following conditions: 
* Either formula_8 or formula_9
* formula_10 only for finitely many indices .
* If denotes the largest index such that formula_11 then formula_12
* If formula_10 and formula_14 then exactly one of the following two conditions holds: formula_15 or formula_16
Informally, these conditions means that every digit of the binary representation of formula_17 that equals 1 belongs to a pair ...0110..., except for ...010... at the very end.

Now, is an explicit set consisting entirely of isolated points but has the counter-intuitive property that its closure is an uncountable set.

Another set with the same properties can be obtained as follows. Let be the middle-thirds Cantor set, let formula_18 be the component intervals of formula_19, and let be a set consisting of one point from each . Since each contains only one point from , every point of is an isolated point. However, if is any point in the Cantor set, then every neighborhood of contains at least one , and hence at least one point of . It follows that each point of the Cantor set lies in the closure of , and therefore has uncountable closure.

<text>Jasło is a county town in south-eastern Poland with 36,641 inhabitants, as of 31 December 2012. It is situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999), and it was previously part of Krosno Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is located in Lesser Poland, in the heartland of the Doły (Pits), and its average altitude is 320 metres above sea level, although there are some hills located within the confines of the city. The Patron Saint of the city is Saint Anthony of Padua.

==History==

In the early days of Polish statehood, Jasło was part of the Castellany of Biecz, out of which &quot;Biecz County&quot; emerged in the 14th century. A list of rectories, created for collecting tithes, a church in &quot;Jassel&quot; in Zręcin deanery, Kraków diocese, is shown in 1328. The area of the future town belonged to a Cistercian Abbey from Koprzywnica, and by the mid 13th century, Jasło, known then as &quot;Jasiel&quot; or &quot;Jasiol&quot;, had a fair of local importance. Together with a number of other locations in Lesser Poland, the village was granted Magdeburg rights by King Casimir III the Great, on April 23, 1366. In 1368 the king made a transaction with the Cistercian monks - in exchange for the town of Frysztak, and the villages of Glinik and Kobyle, Jasło became a royal town. It already had a parish church, founded before 1325 by King Władysław I the Elbow-high. The parish had a school, and in the mid-14th century, Carmelite brothers came to the town. According to Dlugosz in &quot;Liber beneficiorum Dioecesis cracoviensis,&quot; the church that stands today was built by brothers Stanislaw Cielatko (Czelanthco), Sandomierz scholastic&quot;,&quot; and Mikolaj of Ciołek arms, in 1446. This occurred because the original was destroyed by the Hungarians. The coats of arms of Strzemie, Trąby, Gryf, Janina, and Pobóg are on the vault of the church, and because of this, the &quot;Slownik Geograficzny&quot; suggests these may be noble houses that contributed to the development.

The Polish Golden Age was a period of prosperity for both Lesser Poland and Jasło, which belonged to Kraków Voivodeship of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The city was challenged at the start of the period; in 1474, the King of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus, burned Jasło in his assault of the foothills of the Carpathians. After this, the town grew, but it never became an important urban location of this part of the country. It had a number of artisans, several fairs and markets. Local merchants traded with both Polish and foreign merchants, mostly from the Kingdom of Hungary, taking advantage of the vicinity of the border. In 1550, Joachim Lubomirski, a courtier of King Sigismund II Augustus, and his lineage, was given Jasło, after it was converted to a &quot;starostwo.&quot; When referring the details of a 1564 city inspection, the &quot;Slownik Geograficzny&quot; described: &quot;Judging by the number of bakers and cobblers, one must conclude that the town was significantly larger than today.&quot; This is about the Jasło of around 1902, with 2,962 inhabitants at that later time. Jasło was given to Mikołaj Struś by King Sigismund III of Poland in 1613. He revived the town and strengthened the prohibition against Jews, &quot;because they hinder the townsmen in trade and buy up all the victuals,&quot; as described Strus, according to the &quot;Slownik Geograficzny.&quot;
Good times ended in the 1650s. In 1655, the town was captured and destroyed by the Swedes (see the Deluge), in 1657 – by the Transilvanians of George II Rakoczi, and in the first years of the 18th century - again by Swedish troops of King Charles XII of Sweden (see Great Northern War). Additionally, destructive fires occurred in Jasło in 1683, 1755, and 1826, which likely slowed development of the city. The town was destroyed once again by the Russians during the Bar Confederation.

Adam Tarlo became the starosta of Jasło in 1733, and Jedrzej Moszczenski was the next starosta to take office. The starosta lived in a castle in Krajowice, since Jasło had no walls or castle; no traditional castle ruins exist in Jaslo. A monastery and church of the Carmelites also existed in Jasło. The &quot;Slownik Geograficzny&quot; suggests that it was probably founded before 1437. A well, which St. Wojciech supposedly blessed while traveling from Hungary, existed in the church, which drew pilgrims to the town. The monastery was changed to an office for the &quot;starosta in 1786,&quot; the well cannot be found today.

In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland, Jasło was annexed by Austria, and made part of Galicia. In 1790, the town became the seat of a district, which had been moved here from Dukla. Several Austrian civil servants came here, and office buildings, with a new town hall, courthouse, prison and schools were built. Several houses in the market square burned in the 1826 fire, which resulted in a construction boom, and in early 1846, farmers from villages around Jasło took part in the Galician peasant revolt. On June 12, 1846, the Galician riots bred a wave of anti-Jewish riots, which swept through the city, injuring and destroying the property of many of the native Jews. Very close to Jasło, the spirit refinery of Jacob Frant was burnt down. Fire-fighting utilities were ordered not to extinguish the fires by the district captain that arrived at the scene, and other authorities did not intervene. The city and surrounding villages were reported to contain six thousand inhabitants at this time, and a quarter of that population was Jewish, according to the special correspondent of The Jewish World newspaper at the time. One of the clerics that mobilized the peasantry in the following 1848 anti-Austrian rising was Father Karol Szlegal from near Jasło.
Between 1840 and 1849, the city maintained a population of about 1950 individuals, according to census data included in the &quot;Dictionary of Geography&quot;. In 1858, Ignacy Łukasiewicz, a world-renowned inventor, moved to Jasło. Due to his pioneering work, an oil well was constructed in Niegłowice near Jasło (1889–1890). Near Jasło and the nearby town of Krosno, other crude-oil refineries were established in the mid-late 1800s. At approximately same time, a rail line from Stróże to Zagórz was constructed (1872-1884), with additional connection from Jasło to Rzeszów opened in 1890. &quot;The Parish of Christ&#x27;s Crucifixion,” which resides at the cemetery, was established in 1862. In 1860, the Austrian Imperial administration again declared the right for Jews to live inside the confines of Jasło. Afterwards, the Jewish population rapidly increased, ingraining itself in the financial and commercial sectors of the city and nearby areas.
In the early 20th century, the population of Jasło was 10,000. The town was well-kept and clean, a power plant was built in 1897, then a municipal park was opened, and in September 1900, Jasło was visited by Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria. Between 1880 and 1902, agriculture and cloth manufacturing were the common main occupations in the area around the city. Around 1910, the priest Kisevsky and his six gendarmes persecuted Eastern Orthodox peasants by fining them on trivial pretexts, and many were taken to the court in Jasło to receive their sentences. A Jewish lawyer represented the Orthodox peasants, and described that the Jews in the area were not persecuted for handling lit candles openly, for which the Orthodox peasants were fined. The Ukrainian national group known as the Prosvita (Enlightenment) Society developed affiliates in Jasło between 1893 and 1903. By 1914, the Society spread to 22 Lemko villages, and promoted Ukrainian national ideology, identity, and language.

Several World War I battles took place in the area of Jasło, but the town itself was not destroyed. The city was taken behind the Russian front. Railroads ran from Sanok to Jasło and from Jasło to Przemysl, which the occupying Russian forces relied on for transportation of food, munitions, and troops through the front. In May 1915, in the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive, Russian forces were pushed back by the Germans, who entered Jasło on May 6, 1915, at 22:30. Prussian commander August von Mackensen moved his headquarters to Jasło the following morning, after the line was pushed back several miles beyond the city. Following the war, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the town.

In the Second Polish Republic, Jasło was the seat of a county in Kraków Voivodeship. For most part of the interwar period, unemployment and poverty were prevalent, and the situation began slowly to improve in the late 1930s, after creation of the Central Industrial Region. In 1937, &quot;Gamrat&quot; chemical plant was opened, but all efforts were destroyed in the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939.
Under German occupation Jasło belonged to the General Government, and was an important center of the Polish resistance movement. At the turn of 1939 and 1940, 93 Poles who tried to cross the border to find refuge in Hungary were imprisoned by the Germans in Jasło, and then massacred in the nearby village of Sieklówka (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). 27 Poles born in Jasło, as well as other Poles who lived or studied in the town, were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. In the night of August 5/6, 1943, the Kedyw carried out a successful attack on the local prison. Poles who rescued Jews from the Holocaust, were tied up with Jews by the Germans and deported with them. In September and October 1944, after the Soviet–German frontline was established, and remained unchanged for several months, the Germans began expulsion of all inhabitants of Jasło, as the town was located on the front line. In the late autumn of 1944, Wehrmacht units burned the whole town, as the occupying German administration ordered the town to be destroyed, and as a result, 90% of Jasło was destroyed. It was one of the most destroyed Polish towns. In January 1945, only 365 people dwelled among the ruins of the town.

== Etymology ==
The name derives from Old Polish common word for the &quot;manger&quot; or &quot;trough [trof]&quot; which sounded &quot;jasło&quot; &lt; *jesło (before the Lechitic umlaut). Plausibly, it comes from the Slavonic verb &quot;to eat&quot; - &quot;jeść&quot; &lt; *jesti. The Modern Polish equivalent is &quot;żłób&quot; or more seldom &quot;koryto&quot; and the word &quot;jasło&quot; is forgotten in this meaning. The Germanized version was &quot;Jassel&quot; or &quot;Jessel&quot; which appeared in 1325.

== Transport ==
Jasło is an important railroad junction of southeastern Poland, with trains going into three directions - eastwards (to Zagórz), westwards (to Stróże) and northeast, to Rzeszów. Another line, along the Wisłoka to Dębica, was planned in the interebellum period. Construction on it began in 1938, but it was never completed because of World War II.

== Education ==

* Podkarpacka Szkoła Wyższa

== Sports ==
→Jasło is home to a sports club Czarni Jasło, founded in 1910.

→Polish Folk Dance

==Churches of Jasło==

Jasło has a population that includes Roman Catholics, Greek Catholics, non-Catholics (mostly Protestants), and a small Jewish population. However, it is mainly Roman Catholic, and contains 9 Catholic Churches.

<doc id="390560" wikidata="Q201729" url="?curid=390560" title="Sanok, Poland">
<text>Sanok (in full the Royal Free City of Sanok — , , &quot;Sanok&quot;, , &quot;Sianok&quot; or &quot;Sianik&quot;, , , &quot;Sūnik&quot; or &quot;Sonik&quot;) is a town in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship of southeastern Poland with 38,397 inhabitants, as of June 2016. Located on the San River and around south of Przemyśl, Sanok lies directly by the Carpathian Mountains.

The town&#x27;s history goes back almost a thousand years to when it was part of a medieval trade route. The Museum of Folk Architecture as well as the refurbished Sanok Castle and Old Town are popular points of interest. The region also features a 70 km trail for hikers and cyclists.

==Geography==
The city of Sanok is the capital of Sanok County in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship in Poland. Previously, it was in the Krosno Voivodeship (1975–1998) and in the Ruthenian Voivodeship (1340–1772), which was part of the Cherven Cities/Red Ruthenia region, and in wider sense, of the Lesser Poland Province (not of Lesser Poland proper). Historically, it was part of the &quot;Land of Sanok&quot;.

This historic city is situated on the San River at the foot of Castle Hill in the Lesser Poland (&quot;Małopolska&quot;) region. It lies in a wooded, hilly area near the national road number 28, which runs along southern Poland, from Ustrzyki Dolne to Wadowice ( away). It is located in the heartland of the Pogórze Bukowskie part of Doły (Pits), and its average elevation is above sea level, although there are some hills located within the confines of the city.

Sanok is located on the bank of the river San. The area surrounding mountain range stretches between the Wisłok, Osława and San Rivers in the Salt Mountains (Central Beskidian Piedmont), in the inland with temperateness climate. The hills of the Bieszczady mountain range are typical for this countryside. Sanok County is bordered by Krosno County to the west, Brzozów County to the north, Przemyśl County to the north-east and Lesko County to the east. It also borders Slovakia to the south. 
Before World War II, the Oslawa and San Rivers line was designated the &quot;wild frontier&quot; between Poles and Lemkos.

The city is a member of Carpathian Euroregion, which is designed to bring together the people who inhabit the region of the Carpathian Mountains and to facilitate their cooperation in the fields of science, culture, education, trade, tourism and economy.

==History==
===Middle Ages===
In 981, Sanok along with several other Cherven gords, then inhabited by the Slavic tribe of Lendians, was made a part of Red Ruthenia, when Vladimir I of Kiev invaded the area and took it over from Poland. In 1018, the settlement along with the surrounding region returned to Poland, and in 1031, was again recaptured by Rus&#x27;. In 1339, the town was given the Magdeburg law by Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia.

Sanok was mentioned in the Ruthenian Hypatian Codex chronicle, where one can read that in the year 1150: &quot;The Hungarian King Géza II of Hungary crossed the mountains and seized the stronghold of Sanok with its governor as well as many villages in the Przemyśl area&quot;. The same chronicle refers to Sanok twice more, stating that in 1205 it was the meeting place of a Ruthenian princess Anna and a Hungarian king, and that in 1231 a Ruthenian prince made an expedition to &quot;Sanok - &quot;Hungarian Gate&quot;&quot;.

During the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, Sanok was seized by King Casimir III of Poland, who reconfirmed its municipal status on 25 April 1366, and made it a royal city of the Polish Crown. At that time Sanok became the centre of a new administrative district called Sanok Land, a part of the Ruthenian Voivodeship. Several courts of justice operated in the town, including the municipal and rural courts of lower instance and also the higher instance court for the entire Sanok Land, based on the German town law. Germans settled in the territory of the Kingdom of Poland (territory of present-day Subcarpathian Voivodeship) from the 14th to 16th centuries (&quot;see &quot;), mostly after the region returned to Poland in 1340, when Casimir III of Poland took the Czerwień towns.

Marcin Bielski states that Bolesław I the Brave had settled some Germans in the region to defend the borders against Hungary and Kievan Rus&#x27;, who later turned to farming. Maciej Stryjkowski mentions German peasants near Przeworsk, Przemyśl, Sanok, and Jarosław, describing them as good farmers. The region was also traditionally inhabited by subgroups of the Rusyn people: Lemkos and Boykos.

===Modern period===
As early at the 17th century, an important trade route went across Sanok connecting the interior of Hungary with Poland through the Łupków Pass. As a result of the First Partition of Poland (Treaty of St-Petersburg dated 5 July 1772), Sanok was attributed to the Habsburg monarchy. At that time the area (including west and east of Subcarpathian Voivodship) became known as the Galicia province. For more details, see the article Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.

In the mid-18th century, 47.7% of the town&#x27;s population was Roman Catholic (Polish), 36.4% Jewish, and 14.7% Greek Catholic (Ruthenian).

The Galician peasant revolt took place in the region during the revolutions of 1848.

The course of the river Dunajec and that of the San, both in West Galicia, marked the two successive stages in the breakthrough battle which initiated the Austro-German offensive of 1915 on the eastern front. An attempt to hold the line of the Wisłok river and the Łupków Pass failed before renewed Austro-German attacks on 8 May 1915. Wisłok Valley was one of the strategically important Carpathian rivers bitterly contested in battles on the Eastern Front of World War I during the winter of 1914–1915.

During World War I, the Russian army occupied the town from May until July, 1915 and significantly damaged the town. The town was subsequently occupied by troops of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

In 1918 Poland regained independence and control of the town and within the interwar Second Polish Republic it was the seat of the Sanok County in the Lwów Voivodeship. Sanok was known as a centre of Ukrainian movement in Galicia, and of cultural heritage of the Lemkos and other Rusyns.

===World War II===

The Jewish population of Sanok may have comprised nearly 30% of the total population in the early 20th century. During the joint German–Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, in September 1939, it was invaded by Germany, and the &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town on September 25, 1939 to commit various atrocities against the populace. In 1939–1940, the Germans imprisoned many Poles in the local prison, especially those who tried to escape occupation to take refuge in Hungary. The Germans then massacred 112 Poles at the Gruszka mountain near Tarnawa Dolna. The victims are buried at the Central Cemetery in Sanok. At the beginning of the German occupation during World War II, the Jewish population was around 5,000. During the occupation, most of the Jews were either executed or killed in Nazi death camps or Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust. Some of the actions against the Jews were assisted by local auxiliaries and hundreds of the deaths occurred in Sanok itself, while the Polish resistance movement established the secret Polish Council to Aid Jews &quot;Żegota&quot;, which operated in the town. Buildings that had been owned by Jews were taken over by the local population. The local Jewish cemetery still exists. Several hundred Jews are thought to have survived, most of whom fled to the Soviet Union at the beginning of the war. Some of the Jews emigrated to Canada and the United States in the early 1900s with Sanoker Burial Societies spreading throughout New York and other regions where they settled.

In 1942, Sanok was the location of the Stalag 327 prisoner-of-war camp, following its relocation from Jarosław and before its further relocation to Przemyśl. Afterwards the present-day district of Olchowce was the location of a subcamp of Stalag 327, in which some 7,000-10,000 POWs died.

In 1943 the foundation of the Waffen-SS Division Galizien took place among the Ukrainian minority in Sanok, with many locals volunteering in the ethnic Ukrainian Waffen-SS. Because of material support and assistance provided by the Ukrainian minority to the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, which was waging a battle for Ukrainian separatism against the Polish state, new Soviet-installed communist authorities deported the Ukrainian (and Lemko) population of Sanok and its region to the Recovered Territories attached to Poland after World War II during Operation Vistula (1946–1947). Some of the Lemkos expelled returned to Sanok in 1957-58 and others after 1989.

Sanok contains an open-air museum called a in the Biała Góra district, where examples of architecture from all of the region&#x27;s main ethnic groups have been moved and carefully reassembled in a skansen evoking everyday rural life in the 19th century.

==Archaeology==
Settled in prehistoric times, the south-eastern Poland region that is now Subcarpathia was overrun in pre-Roman times by various tribes, including the Celts (Anarti), Goths and Vandals (Przeworsk culture and Púchov culture). In the Middle Ages, the area was inhabited by the Polish tribe of Lendians, and the area was also invaded by Hungarians, before it eventually became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century.

The region subsequently became part of the Great Moravian state. Upon the invasion of the Hungarian tribes into the heart of the Great Moravian Empire around 899, the Lendians of the area declared their allegiance to Hungarian Empire. The region then became a site of contention between Poland, Kievan Rus&#x27; and Hungary starting in at least the 9th century.

The first traces of settlement in the area of modern Sanok date back to at least the 9th century. The following century a Slavic fortified town (&quot;gord&quot;) was created there and initially served as a center of pagan worship. The etymology of the name is unclear, though most scholars derive it from the Celtic river-name &quot;San&quot;. Certain archaeological excavations performed on the castle hill and on &quot;Fajka hill&quot; near Sanok-Trepcza, not only confirm the written resources, but date the Sanok stronghold origin to as early as the 9th century. On Fajka hill, where probably the first settlement of Sanok was situated, some remains of an ancient sanctuary and a cemetery were found, as well as numerous decorations and encolpions in Kievan type. Also found were two seals of the Great Kievan Prince Rurik Rostislavich from the second half of the 12th century.

<text>Krosno (in full The Royal Free City of Krosno, ) is a historical town and county in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship, in southeastern Poland. The estimated population of the town is 47,140 inhabitants as of 2014.

The functional urban area of Krosno has a population of 115,000 inhabitants.

Krosno is a medieval fortified town, a former Royal Free Town and centre of cloth, linen, canvas, baize and Hungarian wine trade. It is also notable for its glassmaking traditions, which became known as the Krosno Glassware. Until recently it was a provincial capital.

==Geography==
The River Wisłok passes by Krosno. Slovakia is about south, and Ukraine is about east of the city. It is located in the heartland of the Doły (Pits), and its average altitude is above sea level, but some hills are located within the confines of the city.

Neighbouring municipalities are Korczyna, Krościenko Wyżne, Miejsce Piastowe, Chorkówka, Jedlicze, and Wojaszówka.

Situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously it was the capital of Krosno Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Krosno County.

Krosno covers an area of , and has seven separate town quarters and 5 housing estates. The historical centre is situated on a hill between the fork of the Lubatówka and Wisłok Rivers (tributary of the San River).

==History==
===Middle Ages===
The first mention of the town, which names Krosno as one of 34 estates in Lesser Poland granted to the Bishopric of Lubusz, appears in a document signed by High Duke of Poland Leszek II the Black in 1282. However, the oldest traces of settlement in the fork of the Wisłok and Lubatówka Rivers, found during archaeological research, date back to the 10th and 11th centuries. The area was inhabited by the old Polish tribe of Lendians.

Today it is difficult to clearly determine the etymology of the place-name of Krosno. Scholars give several versions explaining the origin of the name. Some researchers thought that the name is connected with &quot;weaving loom&quot; (in Polish: &quot;krosno&quot;), while others traced it back to &quot;pustules&quot;, &quot;pimples&quot; or &quot;being pimply&quot; (in Polish: &quot;krosta&quot;, &quot;krostowatość&quot;), which apparently reflected the bumpy shape of the area where the first settlement was founded. Finally an opinion was adopted that the original Polish name disappeared and the existing name is the result of a transformation of the German (&quot;see: Walddeutsche&quot;) name &quot;Krossen&quot;.

The date of the first foundation charter of the town is not known though we may presume that the oldest preserved royal document of Casimir the Great, dating from 1367, regarding the sale of the Krosno aldermanship, was modelled on an earlier foundation act. Hence it should be assumed that about the middle of the 14th century, King Casimir transformed Krosno from a settlement into a town chartered according to the Magdeburg rights and brought in numerous groups of German settlers.

Krosno, a royal town from its origin, used the coat of arms of the Kuyavian branch of the Piast dynasty (half an eagle and half a lion with a crown over their heads) and, owing to the king&#x27;s foundation, was surrounded with a defensive wall as early as the 14th century. During the reign of Casimir III the Great the construction of stone fortifications was begun to encircle the hill. But it was only under King Władysław II Jagiełło that the full-length stone and partly earth town fortifications were completed. Two gates led into the town: the Hungarian one from the south-east and the Kraków one from the north-west. The well-fortified and secure town provided perfect conditions for the development of craft and trade. The statutes of the butchers guild were known as early as 1403 and in the middle of the 15th century the guilds of bakers, shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths as well as clothiers and fullers were constituted. Krosno became an important production centre of cloths and fustians.

The medieval town had waterworks and a sewage system, which is evidence of its importance and the wealth of its inhabitants. The privilege granted by King Casimir IV Jagiellon in 1461 shows that Krosno, next to Kraków and Lwów, was the third town in the Kingdom of Poland with such facilities. The archaeological research conducted recently, based on the dendrochronological method, enabled scholars to move the date of the system&#x27;s installation back to the middle of the 14th century. The pipe-line master dealt with repairs and maintenance of the whole water-supply and sewage systems. From the research conducted by the Krosno archaeologists it appears that the system was used until the beginning of the 19th century.
The 15th century meant the beginning of commerce development for Krosno. Apart from local trade during weekly Monday fairs the town participated in a large-scale import-export and transit commerce. The main trade routes led to the Red Ruthenia, Hungary and the countries of southern Europe. The largest transactions were made during yearly fairs held three times a year. The trade was mainly in local cloths and baizes, horses, cattle, copperware and imported commodities made of copper and iron, and obviously, in Hungarian wine, on which several Krosno merchant families made fortunes. The first Jews to settle in Krosno were the brothers Nechemia and Lazar of Regensburg who received special permits from the Polish King, Władysław II Jagiełło in the 15th century.

===Early modern era===
In spite of natural disasters (flood in 1497, the fire of a suburb in 1474 and of the town in 1500), Thomas Tarczay&#x27;s troops raids (1473 and 1474), pestilence, which nearly depopulated the town, the 16th century was the most favourable for the development of Krosno. The town had its own bleachery, fullery, brickyard, flour mill, municipal baths, it enjoyed the royal privilege for limestone excavation, it had the customs chamber and the right of storage of commodities. High standards of living in Krosno, called at that time &quot;parva Cracovia&quot;, resulted partially from the activity of the local parish school. In the years 1400-1600 173 natives of Krosno studied in the Kraków Academy, which is evidenced by the entries in Album studiosorum.

Krosno of the 16th century was renowned not only for the wealth of its inhabitants, thrift and wide commercial contacts. It was also one of the most populous towns in the province of Lesser Poland: the population is estimated at 4 thousand. The view of Krosno was included in the work of J. Braun and F. Hoghenberg entitled &quot;‘The Towns of the World’&quot;, published in Cologne in 1617 or in Andreas Cellarius&#x27;s work entitled &quot;‘Regin Poloniae Magnique Ducatus Lithuaniae omniumque regionum subiectorum novissima descriptio’&quot;, published in Amsterdam in 1659.

At the beginning of the 17th century there were about 11 collective guilds in which craftsmen representing 79 production and service trades were associated. Apart from traditional specialities connected with basic functions of the town there were also goldsmiths, painters, comb-makers, armourers, pavers, leather-dressers, violin makers and soapboilers. But it was commerce that provided the town with most revenues, both from goods exchange and from services for visiting merchants. Local clerks, scribes, innkeepers, brewers, and even townspeople providing accommodation and letting shops and cellars earned a lot. Higher donations were given to the clergy for church expenses. At that time many Hungarian merchants settled in Krosno, mainly those trading in wine. Scots, who specialised in large-scale commerce, also came to stay and the most outstanding person among them was Robert Porteous, a wine trader from Langside, Dalkeith, who used his wealth to become a benefactor of institutions within the city. There were also Armenians and Ruthenians from Lwów, but the most numerous group of traders were Jews, although Krosno had a privilege &quot;‘de non tolerandis Judeis’&quot;, barring Jews from residing and trading within the city walls. Jewish traders living in nearby townships of Korczyna, Rymanów or Dukla were frequently jailed and their wares confiscated for attempting to enter Krosno.

The middle of the 17th century witnessed the beginning of a gradual loss of the earlier position of the town. Natural disasters, raids of the Swedish, Transylvanian, and Tartar troops, pestilences and war requisitions brought Krosno to a desperate state at the end of 17th century.

===19th century and interbellum===
In the time of the partitions of Poland and under the Austrian rule, once rich and important, the town experienced a period of severe impoverishment. It became one of many small towns of Galicia. Weaving was the only handicraft which enjoyed prosperity at that time. Large-scale flax and hemp plantations provided work for many weaving shops near Krosno. Korczyna and Kombornia were the strongest centres of this industry but there were thousands of home weaving shops in the vicinity of Krosno. 
It was not until the middle of the 19th century, the period of the Galician autonomy from 1867 to the outbreak of the World War I, that Krosno started to rise from the decline. The birth of Polish oil industry undoubtedly contributed to the notable and rapid increase of importance of the town. The first oil company started by Ignacy Łukasiewicz, Tytus Trzecielski and Karol Klobassa in 1856 and the refinery they erected in Chorkówka caused gradual inflow of foreign capital. As a results of the new administrative division the Krosno district (powiat) was established and in 1867 Krosno became the seat of the offices of the district authorities (starostwo). At the turn of the 20th century many societies, schools and institutions were established in the town: Loan Society, Nationwide Weaving School, Teacher Training School, Real Secondary School, &quot;Zgoda&quot; (Accord) Townspeople&#x27;s Society, &quot;Sokół&quot; (Falcon) Gymnastic Society, Bleach and Finish Plant, an oil refinery, the First Domestic Factory of Tower Clocks. This state of relative progress lasted until the outbreak of World War I.

During the war Krosno suffered serious damages. The inhabitants of the town, bombed and looted several times, suffered both from the Austrian and the Russian troops. After the war, in 1918, Poland regained independence and control of the town. In interwar Poland, Krosno was a county seat administratively located in the Lwów Voivodeship, and the town evolved gradually into an important industrial centre: a licence was issued to establish a flax straw breaking plant and a linen weaving plant, in the 1920s Polish Glass Factory, Joint-Stock Company was set up, in 1928 the construction of the airfield was begun and the aviation school was moved to Krosno from Bydgoszcz, in the 1930s the hangars were erected.

===World War II===
During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on 4 September 1939, the Poles evacuated the local aviation school in three groups to Łuck in then-eastern Poland. After the Soviet invasion of Poland from the east, two groups were captured by the Soviets, while one managed to escape through the Polish-Romanian border.
Krosno was under German occupation from 8 September 1939 to 11 September 1944. On 25 September 1939, the German &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town to commit various atrocities against the populace. As a result of the genocidal policy of Nazi Germany, which goal was also the biological extermination of Polish children, about 80% of Polish children in the area suffered from anemia. 100 Poles who were either born, lived or studied in Krosno were murdered by the Russians in April–May 1940 in the large Katyn massacre. Among the victims were many local policemen. 24 students of the local aviation school were murdered in Katyn and Kharkiv. From 1942 to 1944, the Germans operated a forced labour camp for Jews in the town.

The war interrupted the prosperous development of Krosno. The machinery and equipment of the glass factory, the refinery and the flax processing plant were stolen or devastated. The Krosno industry was completely ruined.

===Post-war period===
In September 1944, almost immediately after liberation, the reconstruction of the industry, destroyed during World War II, began. The glass factory and the flax plant were put into operation. Later on research in geology and oil drilling began, &quot;Polmo&quot; Shock Absorbers Factory and Transport and Aircraft Equipment Factory (WSK) were set up. Oil industry was and still is of importance for the town. Oil Industry Engineering Institute, &quot;Naftomet&quot; Oil Drilling Equipment Factory, Oil Drilling Establishment and &quot;Naftomontaż&quot; enterprise ( assembling oil drilling equipment on oil fields) are organizations which continue the oil industry traditions of the region.

==Climate==
Krosno has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm or a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dfb&quot;) using the isotherm. Krosno has warm summers and cold winters.

==Economy==
Krosno is located in an oil bearing region. Surface seepage of oil was locally used (unrefined) in lamps as early as the 16th century. In the 19th century Ignacy Łukasiewicz a local pharmacist began exploiting the deposits from hand-dug wells, years before the drilling at Titusville, Pennsylvania which is usually said to be the beginning of modern petroleum development.

One of the things that Krosno is well known for is the quality glassware and crystal that is produced in the town, and distributed throughout the world. The history of the company Krosno Glass S.A. (former &quot;Krosno Glassworks&quot;) dates back to 1923. The company employs nearly 2,200 people and is the largest employer in the region. A long tradition in glass production and the influence of the glass industry on the local economy have made Krosno known as the &quot;City of Glass&quot;.

<text>Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm is a computer architecture hardware algorithm for dynamic scheduling of instructions that allows out-of-order execution and enables more efficient use of multiple execution units. It was developed by Robert Tomasulo at IBM in 1967 and was first implemented in the IBM System/360 Model 91’s floating point unit.

The major innovations of Tomasulo’s algorithm include register renaming in hardware, reservation stations for all execution units, and a common data bus (CDB) on which computed values broadcast to all reservation stations that may need them. These developments allow for improved parallel execution of instructions that would otherwise stall under the use of scoreboarding or other earlier algorithms.

Robert Tomasulo received the Eckert–Mauchly Award in 1997 for his work on the algorithm.

==Implementation concepts==
The following are the concepts necessary to the implementation of Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm:

===Common data bus===
The Common Data Bus (CDB) connects reservation stations directly to functional units. According to Tomasulo it &quot;preserves precedence while encouraging concurrency&quot;. This has two important effects:
#Functional units can access the result of any operation without involving a floating-point-register, allowing multiple units waiting on a result to proceed without waiting to resolve contention for access to register file read ports. 
#Hazard Detection and control execution are distributed. The reservation stations control when an instruction can execute, rather than a single dedicated hazard unit.

===Instruction order===

Instructions are issued sequentially so that the effects of a sequence of instructions, such as exceptions raised by these instructions, occur in the same order as they would on an in-order processor, regardless of the fact that they are being executed out-of-order (i.e. non-sequentially).

===Register renaming===
Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm uses register renaming to correctly perform out-of-order execution. All general-purpose and reservation station registers hold either a real value or a placeholder value. If a real value is unavailable to a destination register during the issue stage, a placeholder value is initially used. The placeholder value is a tag indicating which reservation station will produce the real value. When the unit finishes and broadcasts the result on the CDB, the placeholder will be replaced with the real value.

Each functional unit has a single reservation station. Reservation stations hold information needed to execute a single instruction, including the operation and the operands. The functional unit begins processing when it is free and when all source operands needed for an instruction are real.

===Exceptions===
Practically speaking, there may be exceptions for which not enough status information about an exception is available, in which case the processor may raise a special exception, called an imprecise exception. Imprecise exceptions cannot occur in in-order implementations, as processor state is changed only in program order (see ).

Programs that experience precise exceptions, where the specific instruction that took the exception can be determined, can restart or re-execute at the point of the exception. However, those that experience imprecise exceptions generally cannot restart or re-execute, as the system cannot determine the specific instruction that took the exception.

==Instruction lifecycle==
The three stages listed below are the stages through which each instruction passes from the time it is issued to the time its execution is complete.

===Legend===

*RS - Reservation Status
*RegisterStat - Register Status; contains information about the registers.
*regs[x] - Value of register x
*Mem[A] - Value of memory at address A

*rd - destination register number
*rs, rt - source registration numbers
*imm - sign extended immediate field
*r - reservation station or buffer that the instruction is assigned to

====Reservation Station Fields====

*Op - represents the operation being performed on operands
*Qj, Qk - the reservation station that will produce the relevant source operand (0 indicates the value is in Vj, Vk)
*Vj, Vk - the value of the source operands
*A - used to hold the memory address information for a load or store
*Busy - 1 if occupied, 0 if not occupied

====Register Status Fields====
*Qi - the reservation station whose result should be stored in this register (if blank or 0, no values are destined for this register)

===Stage 1: issue===
In the issue stage, instructions are issued for execution if all operands and reservation stations are ready or else they are stalled. Registers are renamed in this step, eliminating WAR and WAW hazards.

*Retrieve the next instruction from the head of the instruction queue. If the instruction operands are currently in the registers, then
**If a matching functional unit is available, issue the instruction.
**Else, as there is no available functional unit, stall the instruction until a station or buffer is free.
*Otherwise, we can assume the operands are not in the registers, and so use virtual values. The functional unit must calculate the real value to keep track of the functional units that produce the operand.

===Stage 2: execute===

In the execute stage, the instruction operations are carried out. Instructions are delayed in this step until all of their operands are available, eliminating RAW hazards. Program correctness is maintained through effective address calculation to prevent hazards through memory.

*If one or more of the operands is not yet available then: wait for operand to become available on the CDB.
*When all operands are available, then: if the instruction is a load or store
**Compute the effective address when the base register is available, and place it in the load/store buffer
***If the instruction is a load then: execute as soon as the memory unit is available
***Else, if the instruction is a store then: wait for the value to be stored before sending it to the memory unit
*Else, the instruction is an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation then: execute the instruction at the corresponding functional unit

===Stage 3: write result===
In the write Result stage, ALU operations results are written back to registers and store operations are written back to memory.
* If the instruction was an ALU operation
** If the result is available, then: write it on the CDB and from there into the registers and any reservation stations waiting for this result
* Else, if the instruction was a store then: write the data to memory during this step

==Algorithm improvements==
The concepts of reservation stations, register renaming, and the common data bus in Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm presents significant advancements in the design of high-performance computers.

Reservation stations take on the responsibility of waiting for operands in the presence of data dependencies and other inconsistencies such as varying storage access time and circuit speeds, thus freeing up the functional units. This improvement overcomes long floating point delays and memory accesses. In particular the algorithm is more tolerant of cache misses. Additionally, programmers are freed from implementing optimized code. This is a result of the common data bus and reservation station working together to preserve dependencies as well as encouraging concurrency.

By tracking operands for instructions in the reservation stations and register renaming in hardware the algorithm minimizes read-after-write (RAW) and eliminates write-after-write (WAW) and Write-after-Read (WAR) computer architecture hazards. This improves performance by reducing wasted time that would otherwise be required for stalls.

An equally important improvement in the algorithm is the design is not limited to a specific pipeline structure. This improvement allows the algorithm to be more widely adopted by multiple-issue processors. Additionally, the algorithm is easily extended to enable branch speculation. 

== Applications and legacy ==
Tomasulo&#x27;s algorithm was implemented in the System/360 Model 91 architecture. Outside of IBM, it went unused for several years. However, it saw a vast increase in usage during the 1990s for 3 reasons:
# Once caches became commonplace, the algorithm&#x27;s ability to maintain concurrency during unpredictable load times caused by cache misses became valuable in processors.
# Dynamic scheduling and branch speculation from the algorithm enables improved performance as processors issued more and more instructions.
# Proliferation of mass-market software meant that programmers would not want to compile for a specific pipeline structure. The algorithm can function with any pipeline architecture and thus software requires few architecture-specific modifications. 

Many modern processors implement dynamic scheduling schemes that are variants of Tomasulo&#x27;s original algorithm, including popular Intel x86-64 chips.

==History==

Pabianice was established in the 10th or 11th century, and was part of early Piast-ruled Poland. In 1297, Władysław I Łokietek granted town rights. Pabianice was a private church town, administratively located in the Szadek County in the Sieradz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1555, Polish King Sigismund II Augustus issued a privilege, which established craft guilds in Pabianice.

Before World War II, Pabianice had a substantial Jewish population, comprising about a quarter of all residents of the town. Jews had been living in the town since the 1700s. Following the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was under German occupation. As part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, in late 1939, the Germans carried out mass arrests of local Polish intelligentsia, who were initially imprisoned in a local transit camp and the nearby Radogoszcz concentration camp, and then either deported to other concentration camps or mostly murdered in nearby forests. Local Polish teachers and activists were murdered by the Germans during large massacres in the nearby Łagiewniki forest (within today&#x27;s city limits of Łódź) in November and December 1939. The Germans also expelled around 1,000 Poles from the town in December 1939. Under German occupation nearly the entire Jewish population was murdered. Some were murdered in the town, several thousand were sent to the Chełmno extermination camp where they were immediately gassed, and others were expelled to Łódź and to forced labour camps in the area. Only about 150 survived of the 9,000 Jews thought to be living in Pabianice at the start of the war. For more on the wartime experience see Megargee. The German occupation ended in 1945.

<text>Zgierz is a city in central Poland, located just to the north of Łódź, and part of the metropolitan area centered on that city. As of 2021, it had a population of 54,974. Located within the historic Łęczyca Land, it is the capital of Zgierz County in the Łódź Voivodeship.

==History==
Zgierz is one of the oldest cities in central Poland. The oldest known mention of Zgierz comes from 1231, when two dukes of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland, Władysław Odonic of Greater Poland and Konrad I of Masovia, held a meeting there. Zgierz acquired its town rights some time before 1288, and those rights were renewed by Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło in 1420. In 1494, King John I Albert exempted the town from taxes for 10 years, and in 1504, King Alexander Jagiellon established three annual fairs. Zgierz was a royal city of Poland, administratively located in the Łęczyca County in the Łęczyca Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, on 3 and 5 September 1939, Zgierz was raided by Germany, and captured on September 6. Already in September 1939, the Germans committed first atrocities against Poles and carried out executions of Polish civilian defenders. Inhabitants of Zgierz were also among Poles murdered in nearby Łagiewniki on September 12 and in Retki on September 16. As part the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, Germans carried out large massacres of Poles from the region in the nearby forests of Łagiewniki and Lućmierz, killing hundreds and thousands of people respectively. Germans also carried out expulsions of Poles and deported over 8,000 people to forced labour to Germany. Some were also killed in Nazi concentration camps, including the interwar director of the local State School of Economics, Jakub Stefan Cezak, and local Protestant parish priest, Aleksander Falzman. Schools were closed, factories were looted, Polish monuments were destroyed. Despite this, the Polish underground resistance movement was active in Zgierz.
Before the war, Zgierz had a thriving Jewish community of around 4,000, which formed 16,6% of the town&#x27;s populace as of 1931. When the Germans occupied the town, they began persecuting the Jews, with the assistance of local ethnic Germans. The synagogue was burned and Jews were kidnapped from the streets for forced labor. Many tried to flee the town, though some of these returned. In December, 1939, the Germans deported 2500 of the Jews to Głowno in the General Gouvernment, German-occupied central Poland. Left behind were fewer than 100 Jews, mostly craftsmen thought to be useful to the Germans. In 1942, these Jews were deported to the Łódź Ghetto. This history is unusual in that no mass killings in Zgierz were reported. Of course, the Jews deported to Łódz and Głowno were caught up in the fate of those communities, and most were later deported to the Treblinka extermination camp. As many as 350 Jewish residents of Zgierz survived the war, but did not return to the town.

On 20 March 1942, the Germans carried out a public execution of 100 Poles in the town, who were then buried in Lućmierz-Las. A memorial was erected at the site of the massacre after the war. Around 50 Poles from Zgierz took part in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. In total over 7,600 inhabitants of Zgierz died under German occupation, which ended in January 1945.

Town limits were expanded in 1954, 1959, and 1988.

In 1415 a small village with inaccessible forests and swamps, belonging to the Szczawiński family was mentioned in one of the Polish chronicles. In 1807, the future owner of Ozorków, Ignacy Starzyński, hoping to expand his textile business, brought 19 drapers from Saxony to the village. In 1815, their number has risen to 117, while the city of Łódź had 331.

A year later, in 1816, the village was granted city rights and became the capital of the Ozorków county. In 1817 the Schlösser family, who came from Aachen, settled in the city and founded the first modern cotton mill. Ozorków was the first settlement that experienced the modern development of cotton and wool industry near the Bzura River and later that spread to Zgierz and Łódź, creating the largest Polish center of the textile industry. Because of the rapidly growing industry started running out of space, already in 1820 business families purchased farmlands from nearby villages. In 1828 the town population rose to 5,669 people. Ozorków was inhabited by a sizeable population of Jewish and German citizens, therefore a synagogue and an Evangelical Church was built in the upcoming years, which also turned the town into a multicultural settlement. In the thirties, Karl Schlösser built a factory in the centre of the town, which also greatly influenced the population. After the fall of the November Uprising, the city underwent a stagnation caused by the loss of orders for the army of Congress Poland, repressive tariff barriers, the growing role of Zgierz and Łódź, as well as the displacement of the market for cotton and wool fabrics. In 1864, during the January Uprising, the local leader of the Polish insurgents Wawrzyniec Jeziorski was hanged by the Russians at the Market Square. In 1866, under the control of Polish Count Feliks Łubieński, Ozorków became a protected city of the Russian Empire, which resulted in greater investment opportunities.

The First World War caused a further economic decline of the city. It was not until the period of independent statehood that it became more attractive for foreign and domestic investors. Already in the early twenties, Ozorków received a railway connection with Łódź and Kutno, and with the electrification of the city carried in 1928, a tramway was built between Ozorków, Zgierz and Łódź (between 1922 and 1928 the line was operated by a steam tram). During the interwar period (1918–1939) two public primary schools as well as a recreational centre were built in the city.
The time of the German occupation of Poland (World War II), beginning in September 1939, was a tragic period in the history of the town. Already on September 12, 1939, the Germans murdered some inhabitants of Ozorków in a massacre of 13 Poles in nearby Łagiewniki (present-day district of Łódź). The town was incorporated directly into the Third Reich and between 1943 and 1945 it was called &quot;Brunnstadt&quot;. The extermination policy of the occupier (the murder of 6,000 Jews and the persecution of the Polish population) resulted in a drastic population decrease. In 1940, the Germans expelled hundreds of Poles from the town, and also established a transit camp at the local movie theater for Poles expelled from the area. Young people were then deported from the camp to forced labour in Germany, and children and older people were deported to the General Government (German-occupied central Poland), while their homes, shops and workshops were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. Jews were forced into a ghetto, and some were afterwards murdered in the town. Hundreds were sent to the Chełmno extermination camp where they were gassed immediately. Others were forcibly taken to work camps or the Lodz ghetto where they were later killed. Only a few survived. The historical synagogue located on Wyszyński Street was completely destroyed by German troops. There is some evidence that a few Poles brought food to Jewish neighbours in the ghetto.

After 1945, there was an expansion and modernization of the cotton and wool industry applied by the new Soviet-installed communist government, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. In the 1950s the development of housing and urban infrastructure resulted in rapid population increase.

Today Ozorków is rapidly increasing in the role of services and slowly loses its former industrial character.

<text>Aleksandrów Łódzki (; ) is a town in Zgierz County, Łódź Voivodeship, Poland. It is a part of the Łódź agglomeration. Aleksandrów Łódzki has an area of , and as of June 2022 its population was 22,160.

==History==
The village was founded in 1816 by . In 1820, Rajmund Rembieliński called Aleksandrów &quot;one of the better towns in Poland.&quot; was the author of the town planning project. In order to gain sympathy of the government, Bratoszewski called the town after the then ruling Russian Emperor Alexander I Romanov. This resulted in Aleksandrów gaining the town rights in 1822. After Bratoszewski died in 1824, the Kossowski family took over the town.

After 1832, the town began to fall back, economically overwhelmed by the nearby towns of Pabianice, Zgierz and Łódź. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, many knitting companies were founded in Aleksandrów, so it is called the cradle of the Polish stocking industry and also gained the nickname &quot;Sock-city&quot; among the citizens. This trade is still the main one today. In 1910, the town gained a tram connection with Łódź, which was discontinued in 1991.
Historically, Aleksandrów was a town of multiple cultures and religions. There were Protestant descendants of German knitters, Jews who were in trade and Catholic Poles who mainly worked as craftsmen and in factories. The Jewish population in 1900 was 1,673. For the Jewish, Aleksandrów was an important religious centre - the seat of Hasidic tzadikim of the Aleksander dynasty founded by Rabbi Yechiel Dancyger (1828–1894). It was also where Rabbi Chanokh Heynekh HaKohen Levin, the second Rebbe of the Ger Hasidim held court until his death in Aleksandrów in 1870.

In 1869, Aleksandrów lost its town rights. These rights were regained in 1924 in the newly reborn Poland.

Currently, it is the seat of the Aleksandrów Łódzki county. In September 2006, the first International Convention of Aleksandrów citizens was held.

<text>Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin ibni Almarhum Tuanku Syed Putra Jamalullail (Jawi: توانكو سيد سراج الدين ابن المرحوم توانكو سيد ڤوترا جمل الليل; born 17 May 1943) is the current Raja of Perlis, reigning since 2000. He previously reigned as the twelfth Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King of Malaysia), from 2001 to 2006.

==Early life and education==

Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin was born in Arau, Perlis, the second of ten children of Raja Putra of Perlis and Raja Perempuan Budriah. He studied at the Arau Malay School until standard two, then from 5 January 1950 he continued his primary education at Wellesley Primary School in Penang followed by Westland Primary School until the end of 1955. Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin began his secondary education at Penang Free School on 9 January 1956 and later left for England to study at Wellingborough School for four years until 1963. He underwent training as a cadet officer at the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, England, from January 1964 until December 1965.

==Early career==

Upon his return from England, Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin served with Malaysia&#x27;s Ministry of Defence. His first post was as second lieutenant in the 2nd Regiment of the Malaysian Reconnaissance Corps on 12 December 1965. In 1966, he was transferred to Sabah and then to Sarawak in 1967. He then served in Pahang for several years until he resigned on 31 December 1969 to return to Perlis. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in December 1967.

In 1970, he served in the armed forces again, as Captain of the Local Territorial Army from 16 November 1970 until 1 October 1972. He was promoted to major on 1 October 1972. Currently, he is the Commanding Officer of Regiment 504 of the Army Reserve Unit with the rank of colonel.

Continuing the tradition of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong rotation, Sirajuddin was elected as the 12th Yang di-Pertuan Agong. His term began on 13 December 2001. This was earlier than expected because the previous and 11th Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Salahuddin of Selangor, died in office on 21 November 2001 while his term should have ended in 2004. At that time, he was the fastest ruler to become the Yang di-Pertuan Agong from his accession to his state&#x27;s throne, at 1 year and 241 days (record now held by Sultan Abdullah of Pahang).

<doc id="390569" wikidata="Q1424771" url="?curid=390569" title="Hazard (computer architecture)">
<text>In the domain of central processing unit (CPU) design, hazards are problems with the instruction pipeline in CPU microarchitectures when the next instruction cannot execute in the following clock cycle, and can potentially lead to incorrect computation results. Three common types of hazards are data hazards, structural hazards, and control hazards (branching hazards).

There are several methods used to deal with hazards, including pipeline stalls/pipeline bubbling, operand forwarding, and in the case of out-of-order execution, the scoreboarding method and the Tomasulo algorithm.

== Background ==
Instructions in a pipelined processor are performed in several stages, so that at any given time several instructions are being processed in the various stages of the pipeline, such as fetch and execute. There are many different instruction pipeline microarchitectures, and instructions may be executed out-of-order. A hazard occurs when two or more of these simultaneous (possibly out of order) instructions conflict.

==Types==

===Structural hazards===
A structural hazard occurs when two (or more) instructions that are already in pipeline need the same resource. The result is that instruction must be executed in series rather than parallel for a portion of pipeline. Structural hazards are sometimes referred to as resource hazards.

Example:
A situation in which multiple instructions are ready to enter the execute instruction phase and there is a single ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). One solution to such resource hazard is to increase available resources, such as having multiple ports into main memory and multiple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) units.

===Control hazards (branch hazards or instruction hazards)===
Control hazard occurs when the pipeline makes wrong decisions on branch prediction and therefore brings instructions into the pipeline that must subsequently be discarded. The term branch hazard also refers to a control hazard.

==Eliminating hazards==

===Generic===

==== Pipeline bubbling ====
&quot;Bubbling the pipeline&quot;, also termed a &quot;pipeline break&quot; or &quot;pipeline stall&quot;, is a method to preclude data, structural, and branch hazards. As instructions are fetched, control logic determines whether a hazard could/will occur. If this is true, then the control logic inserts s (s) into the pipeline. Thus, before the next instruction (which would cause the hazard) executes, the prior one will have had sufficient time to finish and prevent the hazard. If the number of s equals the number of stages in the pipeline, the processor has been cleared of all instructions and can proceed free from hazards. All forms of stalling introduce a delay before the processor can resume execution.

&quot;Flushing the pipeline&quot; occurs when a branch instruction jumps to a new memory location, invalidating all prior stages in the pipeline. These prior stages are cleared, allowing the pipeline to continue at the new instruction indicated by the branch.

===Data hazards===
There are several main solutions and algorithms used to resolve data hazards:
* insert a &quot;pipeline bubble&quot; whenever a read after write (RAW) dependency is encountered, guaranteed to increase latency, or
* use out-of-order execution to potentially prevent the need for pipeline bubbles
* use &quot;operand forwarding&quot; to use data from later stages in the pipeline

In the case of out-of-order execution, the algorithm used can be:

* scoreboarding, in which case a &quot;pipeline bubble&quot; is needed only when there is no functional unit available
* the Tomasulo algorithm, which uses register renaming, allowing continual issuing of instructions

The task of removing data dependencies can be delegated to the compiler, which can fill in an appropriate number of instructions between dependent instructions to ensure correct operation, or re-order instructions where possible.

====Operand forwarding====
====Examples====
: &quot;In the following examples, computed values are in bold, while Register numbers are not.&quot;

For example, to write the value 3 to register 1, (which already contains a 6), and then add 7 to register 1 and store the result in register 2, i.e.:

 i0: R1 = 6
 i1: R1 = 3
 i2: R2 = R1 + 7 = 10

Following execution, register 2 should contain the value 10. However, if i1 (write 3 to register 1) does not fully exit the pipeline before i2 starts executing, it means that R1 does not contain the value 3 when i2 performs its addition. In such an event, i2 adds 7 to the old value of register 1 (6), and so register 2 contains 13 instead, i.e.:

 i0: R1 = 6
 i2: R2 = R1 + 7 = 13
 i1: R1 = 3

This error occurs because i2 reads Register 1 before i1 has committed/stored the result of its write operation to Register 1. So when i2 is reading the contents of Register 1, register 1 still contains 6, &quot;not&quot; 3.

Forwarding (described below) helps correct such errors by depending on the fact that the output of i1 (which is 3) can be used by subsequent instructions &quot;before&quot; the value 3 is committed to/stored in Register 1.

Forwarding applied to the example means that &quot;there is no wait to commit/store the output of i1 in Register 1 (in this example, the output is 3) before making that output available to the subsequent instruction (in this case, i2).&quot; The effect is that i2 uses the correct (the more recent) value of Register 1: the commit/store was made immediately and not pipelined.

With forwarding enabled, the &quot;Instruction Decode/Execution&quot; (ID/EX) stage of the pipeline now has two inputs: the value read from the register specified (in this example, the value 6 from Register 1), and the new value of Register 1 (in this example, this value is 3) which is sent from the next stage &quot;Instruction Execute/Memory Access&quot; (EX/MEM). Added control logic is used to determine which input to use.

===Control hazards (branch hazards)===
To avoid control hazards microarchitectures can:

* insert a &quot;pipeline bubble&quot; (discussed above), guaranteed to increase latency, or
* use branch prediction and essentially make educated guesses about which instructions to insert, in which case a &quot;pipeline bubble&quot; will only be needed in the case of an incorrect prediction

In the event that a branch causes a pipeline bubble after incorrect instructions have entered the pipeline, care must be taken to prevent any of the wrongly-loaded instructions from having any effect on the processor state excluding energy wasted processing them before they were discovered to be loaded incorrectly.

=== Other techniques ===
Memory latency is another factor that designers must attend to, because the delay could reduce performance. Different types of memory have different accessing time to the memory. Thus, by choosing a suitable type of memory, designers can improve the performance of the pipelined data path.

<text>Gostyń (, 1941-45: &quot;Gostingen&quot;) is a town in western Poland, seat of the Gostyń County and Gmina Gostyń in the Greater Poland Voivodeship (from 1975 to 1998 in Leszno Voivodship). According to 31 December 2023 data its population was 27,846.

The total area of Gostyń is . The town comprises 1% of the area of the county and 8% of the commune, according to Główny Urząd Statystyczny.

The main landmark of Gostyń is Basilica of Święta Góra (Holy Hill), the main Marian sanctuary of the archdiocese of Poznań and a masterpiece of Pompeo Ferrari, with the monastery of the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri.

==History==

Gostyń dates back to the 13th century. The town was founded by local nobleman and granted town rights in 1278 by Przemysł II. It was named after the nearby village of Gostyń, which since took the name of Stary Gostyń (&quot;Old Gostyń&quot;). Gostyń was a private town, administratively located in the Kościan County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. It developed as a local centre of trade and crafts. In the 16th century Gostyń was an important regional Reformation center, and in 1565 a synod of various Protestants of Greater Poland was held there. The town suffered during the 17th-century Swedish invasions and an epidemic in the 18th century. In the 18th century one of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

In 1793 Gostyń was annexed by Prussia during the Second Partition of Poland. In 1807 regained by the Poles as part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia. Gostyń was a center of Polish resistance to Germanisation policies. In 1835 &quot;Kasyno Gostyńskie&quot; was founded, a significant local Polish organization, which under the disguise of social activity conducted economic, educational and library activities. The Prussians abolished the organization in 1846 and its library&#x27;s collection was moved to Poznań. Gostyń was the site of preparations for the Greater Poland uprising (1848), and during the uprising, it was captured by the Prussians in April 1848. Many inhabitants took part in the next Greater Poland uprising (1918–19), after which Gostyń joined the re-established Polish state.

===World War II===

During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Gostyń was captured by the Wehrmacht on 6 September 1939. During the Nazi German occupation of Poland, Gostyń became the site of public executions, arrests and expulsions of Poles. First mass arrests and executions were carried out in September 1939. On 21 October 1939 some 30 citizens of the town whose names were listed in the &quot;Sonderfahndungsbuch Polen&quot; (Special Prosecution Book-Poland) prepared by local German minority, were executed by an Einsatzkommando. Among the murdered were Gostyń&#x27;s mayor Hipolit Niestrawski, Polish activists, officials, craftsmen and former Greater Poland insurgents. It was one of many massacres of Poles committed by Germany on 20–23 October 1939 across the region in attempt to pacify and terrorize the Polish population. Mass expulsions began on 4 December 1939, with up to 2,000 Poles deported to General Government on the orders of SS-Standartenführer Ernst Damzog stationing in Poznań. Between spring of 1940 and 15 March 1941 additional 3,222 were deported. , Polish officer and pre-war chairman of the local football club Kania Gostyń, was murdered by the Soviets in the Katyn massacre in 1940.

Despite such circumstances, local Poles organized an underground resistance movement, which included structures of the Polish Underground State, the secret youth organization &quot;Tajny Hufiec&quot;, and the &quot;&quot; organization, which was founded in 1940. &quot;Czarny Legion&quot; was crushed by the Germans in 1941. Several dozens of its members were arrested and then brutally tortured in a prison in Rawicz. After a Nazi show trial in Zwickau in 1942, 12 members were executed in Dresden, and several dozen were imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps, where 37 of them died. German occupation ended in 1945.

<text>Isidor &quot;Izzy&quot; Einstein (1880–1938) and Moe W. Smith (1887–1960) were United States federal police officers, agents of the U.S. Prohibition Unit, who achieved the most arrests and convictions during the first years of the alcohol prohibition era (1920–1925). They were known nationally for successfully shutting down illegal speakeasies and for using disguises in their work.

They made 4,933 arrests. In late 1925, Izzy and Moe were laid off in a reorganization of the bureau of enforcement. A report in &quot;Time&quot; magazine suggested they had attracted more publicity than wanted by the new political appointee heading the bureau, although the press and public loved the team. By 1930 both men were working as insurance salesmen.

==Early lives and educations==
Isidor Einstein (sometimes spelled Isadore) was born in 1880 into a Jewish family in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He grew up speaking Yiddish and likely was educated in a yeshiva; he also learned Hungarian, Polish and German, together with a smattering of other European languages. Einstein emigrated as a young man to the United States around 1901.

Moe W. Smith was born about 1887 in New York City. As a young man, he was a boxer.

==Marriages and families==
Around 1906, Einstein married Esther (born c. 1888, Austria/Galicia; immigrated c. 1891), an immigrant from Galicia. They had at least seven children together, but two died young before 1910. Surviving children were Joseph (c. 1910), Charles (c. 1912), Edward (c. 1914), Albert (c. 1916), and Milton (c. 1927).

Before 1920 Smith married Sadie Strauch, a Jewish native of Bohemia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, who had immigrated to New York and was a native Yiddish speaker. In the 1920 census, Moe and Sadie Smith (born c. 1891, imm./nat. 1898 or 1900) were recorded as living with her brother, Benjamin Strauch in Brooklyn. Their daughter Estelle was born c. 1925.

==Careers==

Einstein had started work as a salesman and later served as a postal clerk. He struggled to support his family, including his father, on that salary. Smith first worked as a cigar salesman, and then managed a small fight club. He also owned a cigar store.

The ratification in 1919 of the amendment to establish Prohibition in the United States required federal and local police forces to recruit new members rapidly in order to enforce the law. With no background in law enforcement, but speaking several languages (Yiddish, Hungarian, German, Polish, with a little Russian, French, Spanish and Italian) in addition to English, Einstein signed up as Prohibition Agent No. 1. In a short time, he invited his friend Moe Smith to join him as a partner. (They were both Masons, and may have met in the fraternal group. Though both were personally indifferent to temperance, they felt the law must be upheld, no matter how hard it was to enforce.)

Einstein and Smith were both rather rotund and apparently disarmed many of their quarry by their unthreatening appearances. They claimed to have used more than 100 disguises and were never detected. Einstein developed what he called the &quot;Einstein Theory of Rum Snooping&quot;. They usually did not carry weapons and made arrests while unarmed. Their disguises included appearing as &quot;streetcar conductor, gravedigger, fisherman, iceman, opera singer&quot; and as the state of Kentucky delegates to the Democratic National Convention of 1924 held in New York, where they found only soda being served. Several times Einstein went to a bar and identified himself as a Prohibition agent. The bouncer, thinking he was joking, laughed and let him in. One time he took bets in the joint that he was the agent whose picture was up on the wall. When the customers paid up, he arrested them.

As Prohibition Bureau agents, they were the most famous and successful, known nationally for making thousands of arrests and gaining a high rate of convictions. They made 4,932 arrests, and achieved a 95% conviction rate. They confiscated 5 million gallons of liquor, worth an estimated $15 million. As a result of their work, thousands of bartenders, bootleggers and speakeasy owners were sentenced to jail.

Einstein and Smith used the press to build support: 

They frequently scheduled their raids to suit the convenience of the reporters and the newspaper photographers, and soon learned that there was more room in the papers on Monday mornings than on any other day of the week. One Sunday, accompanied by a swarm of eager reporters, they established a record by making seventy-one raids in a little more than twelve hours.

In November 1925, the partners were among 38 men laid off from the New York office after a reorganization plan announced by General Lincoln C. Andrews of the national bureau. He and other officials in Washington, D.C. appeared to resent the favorable coverage that Einstein and Smith received, who gained far more attention than higher officials. Andrews was reported as disapproving of Prohibition agents who gained publicity, and Einstein and Smith&#x27;s exploits had been well covered by the press, both tabloids and major papers such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;; their successes were sensational. As &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote at the time, 

The public which looked upon them with as much delight as ever it looked on Robin Hood was denied their adventures — adventures as thrilling as those of Sir Launcelot, as those of Richard Cœur de Lion, as those of Don Quixote de la Mancha.

==Later lives==
Both men went into the insurance business and did well, despite the Great Depression. Einstein worked for the New York Life Insurance Company. He died at age 57, February 17, 1938, several days after having a leg amputated. He was buried at Mount Zion Cemetery, Queens County, New York.

Smith lived until 1960, when he died from a stroke in Yonkers, New York.

==Legacy and honors==
*Einstein wrote an autobiography telling of their exploits, called &quot;Prohibition Agent No 1&quot;. It was published in 1932. It had almost a million readers.
*At their deaths, each man was featured in an obituary in the national magazine &quot;Time&quot;, which noted their joint achievements during Prohibition as the &quot;funniest and most effective team&quot; of federal agents, who made more than 4,900 arrests and confiscated an estimated 5 million bottles of illegal liquor.

==In popular culture==
*Einstein and Smith&#x27;s achievements inspired the television film, &quot;Izzy and Moe&quot; (1985), directed by Jackie Cooper. Jackie Gleason starred as Izzy, and Art Carney as Moe. Einstein&#x27;s great-grandson appears in the film. 
*The musical &quot;Nowhere to Go But Up&quot;, which recalls the exploits of Einstein and Smith, had a brief run on Broadway in 1962, playing 3 previews and 9 performances at the Winter Garden Theatre. Appearing as Einstein and Smith were Tom Bosley and Martin Balsam respectively. The show had music by Sol Berkowitz, book and lyrics by James Lipton, and was directed by Sidney Lumet.

<text>Rawicz (; ) is a town in west-central Poland with 21,398 inhabitants as of 2004. It is situated in the Greater Poland Voivodeship (since 1999); previously it was in Leszno Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Rawicz County.

==History==
The town was founded by Adam Olbracht Przyjemski of Rawicz coat of arms for Protestant refugees from Silesia during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1638 King Władysław IV Vasa granted Rawicz town rights and confirmed the town&#x27;s coat of arms. Rawicz was built as a precisely planned town and developed at a rapid pace. It was located on the trade route connecting Poznań and Wrocław. In 1640, a cloth guild was founded. Cloth production became a leading branch of the local industry, and by the end of the 18th century Rawicz was the leading weaving town of the whole region of Greater Poland. Rawicz was a private town of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Kościan County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown.

After the destruction of Rawicz by the Swedes in 1655 during the Deluge, the town was rebuilt in an impressive way, erecting new townhouses, a Baroque church and a Catholic monastery. The early 18th century was an unfavorable period in the town&#x27;s history. In 1701 it suffered a fire, in 1704-1705 it was occupied by Sweden, foreign troops marched through it: Russians in 1707, Austrians in 1719, Saxons in 1733. In the following decades, rapid development took place again, the construction of the castle was completed and a new Baroque town hall was built. In the second half of the 18th century, there were two breweries, a distillery, a slaughterhouse, and a brickyard in Rawicz.

In 1793, Rawicz was annexed by Prussia as a result of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1807 the town was recovered by Poles as part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw and in 1815 it was again annexed by Prussia, initially as part of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Poznan. The principal industry was the manufacture of snuff and cigars. Trade involved grain, wool, cattle, hides, and timber. In 1905 it had 11,403 inhabitants. After World War I Poland regained its independence in 1918. In 1919 the Battle of Rawicz was fought as part of the Greater Poland uprising, aiming to reunite the region with the reestablished Polish state. Rawicz returned to Poland in January 1920.

On the first day of the invasion of Poland, which started World War II on September 1, 1939, the Germans entered the town, but were forced to withdraw. They entered again on September 5. In the following days the &quot;Einsatzgruppe III&quot; entered the town to commit crimes against Poles. Poles arrested during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; were imprisoned in the local prison. In October 1939 the Germans carried out the first executions of Polish residents, while first mass expulsions of over 500 Poles were carried out in December 1939. The expelled Poles were predominantly local activists and owners of better houses, which were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. Also a transit camp for Poles expelled from nearby villages was operated in the town. Despite such circumstances, the Polish resistance movement was organized in the town. In January 1945, the town was taken over by the Soviets, who imprisoned soldiers of the Polish Home Army here. Later on, the Soviet-appointed communists organized a prison here for political opponents, of which 142 died.

In 1973, Sarnowa was included within the town limits.

A large prison exists in former monastery since 1820.

A 50 billion cubic feet natural gas discovery at Rawicz in 2015 is expected to be the largest gas development in Poland for 20 years.

==Sights==

Among the historic sights of Rawicz are the &quot;Rynek&quot; (Market Square) with the Baroque town hall, the Baroque Church of Saint Andrew the Apostle, the Classicist Church of Saint Andrew Bobola, the Gothic Revival Church of Christ the King, the Planty Park and historic townhouses, dating back to the 18th and 19th century.
==Sports==
Notable local sports clubs are speedway club Kolejarz Rawicz, who race at the Florian Kapała Stadium and football team .

==Transport==

A railway station is located in the town. The expressway S5 and national road 36 run near the town.

==Cuisine==

<text>Kościan () () is a town on the Obra canal in west-central Poland, with a population of 23,952 inhabitants as of June 2014. Situated in the Greater Poland Voivodeship, it is the capital of Kościan County.

==History==

Kościan was founded in the 12th or 13th century, when it was part of the Duchy of Greater Poland of the fragmented Polish realm. It was granted town rights in the second half of the 13th century, which were later confirmed by King Władysław Jagiełło in 1400. From 1332 Kościan was a royal town of Poland. It was a county (&quot;powiat&quot;) seat in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. In the 15th century Kościan was famous for its cloth production. King Casimir IV Jagiellon granted Kościan cloths the first industrial trademark in the history of Poland. At the time Kościan was the second largest city within historic Greater Poland (behind Poznań).

Kościan was captured by the Swedes during the Swedish invasion of Poland (the &quot;Swedish Deluge&quot;) in 1655, but was soon recaptured by a partisan unit led by Krzysztof Żegocki. The town suffered from further Swedish and Russian invasions in the 18th century. The 2nd Polish National Cavalry Brigade was stationed in Kościan. Kościan was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. The Polish Greater Poland uprising of 1794 began in Kościan. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included with the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. The 12th Polish Infantry Regiment was formed in Kościan in 1806. In 1815 it was reannexed by Prussia. In 1918, Poland regained independence, and shortly afterwards the Greater Poland uprising broke out, which goal was to reunite the town and region with the reborn Polish state. On 29–30 December 1918, local Polish scouts stole more than 900 machine guns, rifles and pistols from a German military warehouse and Kościan was liberated.

===World War II===

During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), the Polish population was subject to mass arrests, executions, expulsions, deportations to Nazi concentration camps and confiscation of property. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; carried out public executions of Poles in the town on October 2 and October 23, 1939 as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, killing 8 and 18 people respectively, including activists, merchants, landowners, the director of the local narrow gauge railway, the chairman of the local branch of the &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society, principals of schools from Kościan and the nearby village of Borowo and one student. In Kościan, the Germans operated a prison for Poles from both the town and the region, many of whom were later transported to the infamous Fort VII in Poznań. On November 7 and 9, 1939, 66 Polish craftsmen, merchants, farmers, local officials and workers, previously held in the local prison were massacred in the nearby forest. Further such massacres were carried out by the Germans in December 1939 and in January and February 1940. The local high school principal was among Polish teachers and principals murdered in the Dachau concentration camp. Over 50 Poles, including local activists, intelligentsia and the families of victims of executions, were expelled in 1939, while 2,139 Poles were expelled in 1940, and their houses were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. 534 patients of the local psychiatric hospital were gassed by the Germans in January 1940, and afterwards patients from psychiatric hospitals in Germany were transported to Kościan and also gassed.

The Polish resistance movement was active, including local units of the Union of Armed Struggle/Home Army, &quot;Narodowa Organizacja Bojowa&quot; and the &quot;Pakt Czterech&quot; secret scouting organization. Two Polish underground newspapers were printed in the town. In mid-1941, the Gestapo crushed the &quot;Pakt Czterech&quot; organization and arrested its members, who were then sent to Nazi concentration camps, however, they survived. In October 1941, the Gestapo arrested the founders of the local unit of the &quot;Narodowa Organizacja Bojowa&quot;, who were then sentenced to death and executed the following year. In 1944, the Germans arrested Leon Ciszak and Franciszek Bawor, leaders of the local units of the Union of Armed Struggle and Home Army, who were then imprisoned in the notorious camp in Żabikowo and soon sent to concentration camps. Bawor died in the Mauthausen concentration camp, whereas Ciszak survived and returned to Kościan after the war. The pre-way Polish mayor of the town joined the resistance in Warsaw.

<text>Leszno (, , ) is a historic city in western Poland, seat of Leszno County within the Greater Poland Voivodeship. It is the seventh-largest city in the province with an estimated population of 62,200, as of 2021.

==History==
===Early history===
The city&#x27;s unrecorded history dates to the 13th century. It was first mentioned in historical documents in 1393, when the estate was the property of a noble named Stefan Karnin-Wieniawa. The family eventually adopted the name Leszczyński (literal meaning &quot;of Leszno&quot;), derived from the name of their estate, as was the custom among the Polish nobility.

===16th–18th centuries===

In around 1516, a community of Protestants known as the Unity of the Brethren (&quot;Unitas fratrum&quot;) were expelled from the Bohemian lands by King Vladislaus II and settled in Leszno. They were invited by the Leszczyński family, imperial counts since 1473 and who had converted to Calvinism. The arrival of the Bohemian Protestants, in addition to weavers from nearby Silesia, helped the settlement to grow.

In 1547 it became a town by a privilege according to Magdeburg Law granted by King Sigismund I of Poland. Leszno was a private town, administratively located in the Wschowa County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. Leszno became the largest printing center in Greater Poland thanks to the activity of the Protestant community. Their numbers grew with the inflow of refugees from Silesia, Bohemia, and Moravia during the Thirty Years War.

In 1631, Leszno was vested with further privileges by King Sigismund III Vasa, who made it equal with the most important cities of Poland such as Kraków, Gdańsk and Warsaw. By the 17th century, the town had a renowned Gymnasium (school), which was headed by Jan Amos Komenský (known in English as Comenius), an educator and the last bishop of the Unity of the Brethren. Johann Heermann, a German-speaking poet, lived in Leszno from 1638 until his death in 1647. Between 1636 and 1639, the town became fortified and its area increased.

The era of Leszno&#x27;s prosperity and cultural prominence ended during the Second Northern War, when the town was burnt down on 28 April 1656 by Polish forces faithful to King John Cassimir Vasa in retribution for letting in Swedish forces by protestant majority of burghers. Quickly rebuilt afterwards, it was set on fire again during the Great Northern War by Russian forces in 1707 and was ravaged by plague in 1709.

The Leszczyński family owned the city until 1738, when King Stanislaus I Leszczynski sold it to Aleksander Józef Sułkowski following his abdication. One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through Leszno in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

===19th–20th centuries===

In the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, Leszno was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia, within which it was referred to as &quot;Lissa&quot;. In 1807 it was taken by Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grand Armee&quot; and included within the newly established but short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, in 1815 the town was reannexed by Prussia, initially as part of the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen. The town was subjected to Germanisation policies. Nevertheless, Polish press was issued in the town (&quot;Przyjaciel Ludu&quot;) and in the 1840s, Polish historian, geographer and former officer Stanisław Plater published the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Little Polish Encyclopedia&quot;), one of the pioneering 19th-century Polish encyclopedias, in the town. In 1871 it became part of Germany, and in 1887, it became the administrative seat of the Prussian &quot;Kreis Lissa&quot;.
After World War I, in November 1918, Poland regained independence. Shortly after the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918–19 broke out, attempting to reintegrate Greater Poland and Leszno with Poland. The first local battles of the uprising took place in the area on December 28, 1918. Afterward the city became part of the newly established Second Polish Republic under the Treaty of Versailles, with effect from 17 January 1920. The local populace had to acquire Polish citizenship. In the interbellum, Leszno was a county seat within the Polish Poznań Voivodeship. In 1924, a monument dedicated to the Polish insurgents of 1918–19 was erected.

====World War II====

During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was annexed by Nazi Germany and incorporated into &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot;. The Germans carried out mass arrests of Poles accused of &quot;anti-German activities&quot;. Attending church services and having private meetings in Polish households were considered suspect activities. A prison for Poles was established in the local monastery, where more than 200 people had already been imprisoned in September 1939 during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. The Polish population was expelled to the &quot;General Government&quot; (German-occupied central Poland).

Most of the town&#x27;s Jewish population (which had included such notable rabbis as Leo Baeck and Jacob of Lissa, as well as the writer Ludwig Kalisch) and the remaining Poles were massacred by the Nazi &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, which entered the town in September 1939. A notable public execution of 20 Poles, members of the &quot;Sokół&quot; Polish Gymnastic Society, former Polish insurgents of 1918–19, a local teacher, and a lawyer, was carried out in Leszno by the &quot;Einsatzgruppe VI&quot; on October 21, 1939. Poles who were initially imprisoned in Leszno were also murdered in nearby towns and villages of Poniec, Osieczna, Włoszakowice and Rydzyna. Poles from Leszno were also among the victims of the large Katyn massacre committed by the Russians in April–May 1940.
Already in late 1939, the Germans expelled over 1,000 Poles, including families of Poles murdered in various massacres, in addition teachers, local officials, activists, former insurgents, and owners of shops and workshops, which were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. A transit camp for Poles expelled from various nearby settlements was established in the local school. Poles were held there several days, their money, valuables and food were confiscated, and then they were either deported to Tomaszów Mazowiecki or Łódź in German-occupied central Poland or sent to local German colonists or to Germany as slave labour.

Despite such circumstances, local Poles organized an underground resistance movement, which included the &quot;Ogniwo&quot; and &quot;Świt&quot; organizations, the secret youth organization &quot;Tajna Siódemka&quot; and structures of the Polish Underground State. Polish underground press was printed in Leszno. The German occupation ended in 1945, and the town returned to Poland.

====Post-war history====
The pre-war monument of the Greater Poland insurgents was restored in 1957. The town underwent a period of fast development especially between 1975 and 1998 when it was a seat of a &quot;voivodeship&quot; administrative area. In 1991, a monument to the Constitution of 3 May 1791 and the heroes of the fights for Poland&#x27;s independence was unveiled, and in 1995, a memorial to the victims of the Katyn massacre was unveiled. From 1975 to 1998, it was the capital of the Leszno Voivodeship. In 2000, the city was awarded &quot;The Golden Star of Town Twinning&quot; prize by the European Commission.

== Climate ==
Leszno has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) although notably with warm summer continental characteristics (&quot;Dfb&quot;), typical of inland west and south polish.

<text>Justinus Andreas Christian Kerner (18 September 1786, in Ludwigsburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany – 21 February 1862, in Weinsberg, Baden-Württemberg) was a German poet, practicing physician, and medical writer. He gave the first detailed description of botulism.

==Life==
He was born at Ludwigsburg in Württemberg. After attending the classical schools of Ludwigsburg and Maulbronn, he was apprenticed in a cloth factory, but, in 1804, owing to the good services of Professor Karl Philipp Conz, was able to enter the University of Tübingen. He studied medicine but also had time for literary pursuits in the company of Ludwig Uhland, Gustav Schwab and others. He took his doctor&#x27;s degree in 1808, spent some time travelling, and then settled as a practising physician in Wildbad.

Here he completed his &quot;Reiseschatten von dem Schattenspieler Luchs&quot; (1811), in which his own experiences are described with caustic humour. He next collaborated with Uhland and Schwab in the &quot;Poetischer Almanach&quot; for 1812, which was followed by the &quot;Deutscher Dichterwald&quot; (1813), and in these some of Kerner&#x27;s best poems were published. In 1815 he obtained the official appointment of district medical officer (&quot;Oberamtsarzt&quot;) in Gaildorf, and in 1818 was transferred to Weinsberg, where he spent the rest of his life.

His house, the site of which at the foot of the historical Schloss Weibertreu was presented to him by the townspeople, became a mecca for literary pilgrims, all of whom were made welcome. Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden came with a knapsack on his back. The poets, Christian Friedrich Alexander von Württemberg and Nikolaus Lenau were constant guests, and in 1826 Friederike Hauffe (1801–1829), the daughter of a forester in Prevorst, a somnambulist and clairvoyante, arrived; she forms the subject of Kerner&#x27;s famous work &quot;Die Seherin von Prevorst, Eröffnungen über das innere Leben des Menschen und über das Hineinragen einer Geisterwelt in die unsere&quot; (&quot;The Seeress of Prevorst, revelations of the human inner life and about the penetrations of the spirit world into ours&quot;, 1829; 6th ed., 1892). In 1826 he published a collection of &quot;Gedichte&quot; which were later supplemented by &quot;Der letzte Blütenstrauß&quot; (1852) and &quot;Winterblüten&quot; (1859). Among others of his well-known poems are the charming ballad &quot;Der reichste Fürst&quot;; a drinking song, &quot;Wohlauf, noch getrunken&quot;, and the pensive &quot;Wanderer in der Sägemühle&quot;.

In addition to his literary productions, Kerner wrote some popular medical books, dealing with animal magnetism, the first treatise on sebacic acid and botulism, &quot;Das Fettgift oder die Fettsäure und ihre Wirkung auf den tierischen Organismus&quot; (1822), and a description of Wildbad and its healing waters, &quot;Das Wildbad im Königreich Württemberg&quot; (1813). He also gave a vivid account of his youthful years in &quot;Bilderbuch aus meiner Knabenzeit&quot; (1859) and, in &quot;Die Bestürmung der württembergischen Stadt Weinsberg im Jahre 1525&quot; (1820), showed considerable skill in historical narrative.

In 1851 he was compelled, owing to increasing blindness, to retire from his medical practice, but he lived, carefully tended by his daughters, at Weinsberg until his death. He was buried beside his wife, who had died in 1854, in the graveyard of Weinsberg, and the grave is marked by a stone slab with an inscription he himself had chosen: &quot;Friederike Kerner und ihr Justinus&quot;.

==Association with George Rapp and the Harmony Society==
In &quot;Bilderbuch aus meiner Knabenzeit&quot;, Kerner recalls George Rapp&#x27;s visits to his father, the Oberamtmann at Maulbronn. Kerner&#x27;s father had helped shield Rapp from religious prosecution by the authorities in Germany, and Kerner well remembered Rapp and his long black beard. George Rapp and his followers eventually left Germany in 1803, settled in the United States, and started the Harmony Society. &quot;Die Seherin von Prevorst&quot; and its tale about Kerner&#x27;s relationship with Friederike Hauffe — the latter reputed to have visionary and healing powers, and who had produced a strange &#x27;inner&#x27; language containing Hebrew-like elements — made quite an impression among the members of the Harmony Society in 1829, who saw it as confirmation of the approaching millennium and of their religious views.

==Evaluations==
* &quot;Kerner was one of the most inspired poets of the Swabian school. His poems, which largely deal with natural phenomena, are characterized by a deep melancholy and a leaning towards the supernatural, which, however, is balanced by a quaint humour, reminiscent of the &quot;Volkslied&quot;.&quot; — 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;
* &quot;The poems and dramatic scenes of his &quot;Reiseschatten&quot; are characterized by a dreamy fancy and a peculiar fantastic humor.&quot; — &quot;New International Encyclopedia&quot;
* &quot;He was at times morbid, fanciful, dreamy, sensitive and poetic and endowed with a strange, fantastic humor . . .&quot; — 1920 &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;

==The Saw==
&quot;The Saw&quot; was translated by William Cullen Bryant and was included in Graham&#x27;s Magazine in 1848.
:In yonder mill I rested,
:And sat me down to look
:Upon the wheel&#x27;s quick glimmer.
:And on the flowing brook.

:As in a dream, before me,
:The saw, with restless play,
:Was cleaving through a fir-tree
:Its long and steady way.

:The tree through all its fibres
:With living motion stirred,
:And, in a dirge-like murmur,
:These solemn words I heard—

:Oh, thou, who wanderest hither,
:A timely guest thou art!
:For thee this cruel engine
:Is passing through my heart.

:When soon, in earth&#x27;s still bosom,
:Thy hours of rest begin,
:This wood shall form the chamber
:Whose walls shall close thee in.

:Four planks—I saw and shuddered—
:Dropped in that busy mill;
:Then, as I tried to answer,
:At once the wheel was still.

==Cultural references==
* Robert Schumann set Kerner&#x27;s poems in his Opus 35, &quot;12 Gedichte von Justinus Kerner&quot;, composed in 1840 and dedicated to “Dr. Friedrich Weber in London.” Schumann called the set a &quot;Liederreihe&quot;, or &quot;row of songs.&quot;
* The poet Thomas Medwin stayed with him during 1848 to 1849 and later wrote a poem in his honour, &quot;To Justinus Kerner: With a Painted Wreath of Bay-Leaves&quot;, published in London in 1854.
* Composer Pauline Volkstein (1849-1925) used Kerner’s text for at least one of her lieder.
* The grape variety Kerner, bred in 1929, was named in his honour.
* Søren Kierkegaard wrote in his journal on Kerner:
** “I cannot help being amazed that Justinus Kerner (in his &quot;Dichtungen&quot;) is able to interpret so conciliatingly the phenomenon which has always shocked me since my very first experience of it — that someone says just exactly what I say. To me the phenomenon seemed to be the most confusing, almost Punch-and-Judy, disorder: the one would begin a sentence which the other would finish, and no one could be sure who was speaking.” July 11, 1837Journals 2539
** “Justinus Kerner has interested me so much just now because, although he is far more gifted, I see in him the same artistic barrenness I see in myself. But I also see how something can be done even though essential continuity is lacking and can be fulfilled only by continuity of mood, of which every single little idea is a blossom, a kind of novelistic aphorism, a plastic study. While his own Dichtungen are full of excellent imaginative ideas, his reports aus dem Nachtgebiete der Natur are so dry that we could almost take that to be indirect proof of their truth.” July 13, 1837Journals 5240
