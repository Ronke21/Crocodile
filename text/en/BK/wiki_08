<text>The Battle of Stones River, also known as the Second Battle of Murfreesboro, was fought from December 31, 1862, to January 2, 1863, in Middle Tennessee, as the culmination of the Stones River Campaign in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. Of the major battles of the war, Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides. The battle ended in Union victory after the Confederate army&#x27;s withdrawal on January 3, largely due to a series of tactical miscalculations by Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, but the victory was costly for the Union army. Nevertheless, it was an important victory for the Union because it provided a much-needed boost in morale after the Union&#x27;s recent defeat at Fredericksburg and also reinforced President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s foundation for issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, which ultimately discouraged European powers from intervening on the Confederacy&#x27;s behalf.

Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans&#x27;s Army of the Cumberland marched from Nashville, Tennessee, on December 26, 1862, to challenge Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee at Murfreesboro. On December 31, each army commander planned to attack his opponent&#x27;s right flank, but Bragg had a shorter distance to go and thus struck first. A massive assault by the corps of Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee, followed by that of Leonidas Polk, overran the wing commanded by Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook. A stout defense by the division of Brig. Gen. Philip Sheridan in the right center of the line prevented a total collapse, and the Union assumed a tight defensive position backing up to the Nashville Turnpike. Repeated Confederate attacks were repulsed from this concentrated line, most notably in the cedar &quot;Round Forest&quot; salient against the brigade of Col. William B. Hazen. Bragg attempted to continue the assault with the division of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, but the troops were slow in arriving and their multiple piecemeal attacks failed.

Fighting resumed on January 2, 1863, when Bragg ordered Breckinridge to assault a lightly defended Union position on a hill to the east of the Stones River. Chasing the retreating Union forces, they were led into a deadly trap. Faced with overwhelming artillery, the Confederates were repulsed with heavy losses. Probably fooled by false information planted by McCook and campfires where no troops were posted, set up by Rosecrans, and thus believing that Rosecrans was receiving reinforcements, Bragg chose to withdraw his army on January 3 to Tullahoma, Tennessee. This caused Bragg to lose the confidence of the Army of Tennessee.

==Background==

===Military situation===

After the Battle of Perryville in Kentucky on October 8, 1862, Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Mississippi withdrew to Harrodsburg, Kentucky, where it was joined by Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith&#x27;s army of 10,000 on October 10. Although Bragg&#x27;s newly combined force was up to 38,000 veteran troops, he made no effort to regain the initiative. Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, the Union commander at Perryville, was equally passive and refused to attack Bragg.

Frustrated with his prospects in Kentucky and low on supplies, Bragg withdrew fully from Kentucky through the Cumberland Gap, passed through Knoxville and Chattanooga, turned northwest, and eventually stopped in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. His army, joined with Smith&#x27;s Army of Kentucky and together renamed the Army of Tennessee as of November 20, took up a defensive position northwest of the city along the West Fork of the Stones River. During a visit by Confederate president Jefferson Davis on December 16, Bragg was ordered to send the infantry division of Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson to Mississippi to assist in the defense of Vicksburg. The loss of Stevenson&#x27;s 7,500 men would be sorely felt in the coming battle. Bragg reorganized his army, and Kirby Smith left for East Tennessee.

Bragg commanded two corps, under Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee (divisions of major generals John C. Breckinridge, Patrick R. Cleburne, and John P. McCown) and Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk (divisions of major generals Benjamin F. Cheatham and Jones M. Withers), and a cavalry command under Brig. Gen. Joseph Wheeler. Bragg had to deal with a command problem that became typical for him during the war: a virtual revolt of his senior generals, who petitioned Jefferson Davis to relieve him in favor of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, the commander of all armies in the Western Theater. Davis refused to relieve either Bragg or the rebellious generals.

On the Union side, President Abraham Lincoln had become frustrated with Buell&#x27;s passivity and replaced him with Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, victor of the recent battles of Iuka and Corinth. Rosecrans moved his XIV Corps (which was soon after designated the Army of the Cumberland) to Nashville, Tennessee, and was warned by Washington that he, too, would be replaced if he did not move aggressively against Bragg and occupy eastern Tennessee. However, Rosecrans took ample time to reorganize and train his forces (particularly his cavalry) and resupply his army. He did not begin his march in pursuit of Bragg until December 26.

===Initial movements===
While Rosecrans was preparing in Nashville, Bragg ordered Col. John Hunt Morgan to move north with his cavalry and operate along Rosecrans&#x27;s lines of communications, to prevent him from foraging for supplies north of Nashville. The Battle of Hartsville, at a crossing point on the Cumberland River about 40 miles (64 km) upstream from Nashville (north of Murfreesboro) was an incident in Morgan&#x27;s raid to the north, before Rosecrans had the bulk of his infantry forces on the move. The relatively small battle that followed Morgan&#x27;s surprise attack was an embarrassing Union defeat, resulting in many captured Union supplies and soldiers. The Union also engaged in a strategic cavalry raid. On December 26, the day Rosecrans marched from Nashville, a small force under Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Carter raided the upper Tennessee Valley from Manchester, Kentucky. Until January 5, Carter&#x27;s men destroyed railroad bridges and fought a few skirmishes, including a serious one on December 28 at Perkins&#x27;s Mill (also known as Elk Fort). But none of the cavalry raids, Confederate or Union, had any significant effect on the Stones River Campaign.

The Army of the Cumberland marched southeast the day after Christmas in three columns, or &quot;wings&quot;, towards Murfreesboro, and they were effectively harassed by Wheeler&#x27;s Confederate cavalry along the way, which delayed their movements. Although Rosecrans had reported his army to have 81,729 effectives in Nashville, his force on the march was barely more than half of that since he needed to protect his base and supply lines from the harassment of the Confederate cavalry. The left wing of 14,500 men under Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden (divisions of Brig. Gens. Thomas J. Wood, John M. Palmer, and Horatio P. Van Cleve) took a route that was parallel to the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, passing through La Vergne and south of Smyrna. The right wing of 16,000 men under Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook (divisions of Brig. Gens. Jefferson C. Davis, Richard W. Johnson, and Philip H. Sheridan) marched south along the Nolensville Turnpike to Nolensville, south to Triune, and then eastward to Murfreesboro. The center wing of 13,500 men under Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas (divisions of Maj. Gen. Lovell H. Rousseau and Brig. Gens. James S. Negley, Speed S. Fry, and Robert B. Mitchell) moved south along the Wilson Turnpike and the Franklin Turnpike, parallel to the Nashville and Decatur Railroad, then eastward through Nolensville and along the same route used by Crittenden south of the Nashville and Chattanooga. Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. David S. Stanley (a single cavalry division under Col. John Kennett) preceded each of the three columns. The separation of the wings was designed to conduct a turning movement against Hardee at Triune, but when the U.S. march began, Bragg moved Hardee back to Murfreesboro to avoid a confrontation.

===Geography and location===
Murfreesboro was a small town in the Stones River Valley, a former state capital named for a colonel in the American Revolutionary War, Hardy Murfree. All through the war it was a center for strong Confederate sentiment, and Bragg and his men were warmly welcomed and entertained during the month of December. It was located in a rich agricultural region from which Bragg planned to provision his army and a position that he intended to use to block a potential Union advance on Chattanooga. Hardee noted afterward that &quot;The field of battle offered no particular advantages for defense.&quot; Despite this, Bragg was reluctant to move farther south, say to the arguably more defensible Duck River Valley, or farther north, to Stewart&#x27;s Creek, where Rosecrans thought Bragg would defend. Sensitive to the political requirements that almost no Tennessee ground be yielded to Federal control, he chose the relatively flat area northwest of the politically influential city, straddling the Stones River. Portions of the area, particularly near the intersection of the Nashville Pike and the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, were characterized by small but dense cedar forests, in places more impenetrable to infantry than the Wilderness of Spotsylvania in Virginia. Short limestone outcroppings, separated by narrow cracks as if rows of teeth, impeded the movement of wagons and artillery. Hardee&#x27;s Corps was initially placed in Triune, about 20 miles (32 km) to the west, Polk&#x27;s on the west bank of the river, and a detached division from Hardee&#x27;s Corps under Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge on the low hills east of the river. None of the troops were ordered to construct field fortifications.

===Disposition of armies===

By the time Rosecrans had arrived in Murfreesboro on the evening of December 29, the Army of Tennessee had been encamped in the area for a month. By nightfall, two thirds of Rosecrans&#x27;s army was in position along the Nashville Turnpike, and by the next day Rosecrans&#x27;s army numbered about 41,000 and Bragg&#x27;s 35,000. The odds were closer than those figures would indicate. Bragg had the advantage of the detached, but cooperating, cavalry commands under Forrest and Morgan, who raided deeply behind Union lines while Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry slowed the Union forces with hit-and-run skirmishes. (Part of Rosecrans&#x27;s reluctance to move from Nashville was the inexperience of his cavalry forces in comparison to their Confederate counterparts.) On December 29, Wheeler and 2,500 of his men rode completely around the Union army, destroying supply wagons and capturing reserve ammunition in Rosecrans&#x27;s trains. They captured four wagon trains and 1,000 Union prisoners.

On December 30, the Union force moved into line two miles (three km) northwest of Murfreesboro. The two armies were in parallel lines, about four miles (six km) long, oriented from southwest to northeast. Bragg&#x27;s left flank was weak at the start, and Rosecrans could have attacked there when he arrived and wheeled left, around the flank and directly into the town of Murfreesboro, but he did not know the full disposition of Bragg&#x27;s forces because of the skillful screening of the Confederate cavalry during the Union march. In a manner similar to the previous year&#x27;s First Battle of Bull Run, both commanders devised similar plans for the following day: envelop the enemy&#x27;s right, get into his rear, and cut him off from his base. Since both plans were the same, the victory would probably go to the side that was able to attack first. Rosecrans ordered his men to be ready to attack after breakfast, but Bragg ordered an attack at dawn.

Bragg&#x27;s forces were situated with Leonidas Polk&#x27;s corps on the west side of the river, and William J. Hardee&#x27;s men on the east. He had expected Rosecrans to attack on December 30, but when that did not happen, his plan was to drive Hardee&#x27;s corps and the cavalry under Brig. Gen. John A. Wharton deep into the Union rear. He began moving the bulk of Hardee&#x27;s corps across the river to his left flank to prepare for the next morning&#x27;s attack. This left Breckinridge&#x27;s division in reserve on the east side of the river on the high ground.

===Plans===
Rosecrans intended to have Crittenden cross the river and attack the heights east of the river, which would be an excellent artillery platform to bombard the entire Confederate lines. However, Crittenden—facing Breckinridge on the Union left—failed to notify McCook (on the Union right) of these troop movements. McCook, anticipating the next day would begin with a major attack by Crittenden, planted numerous campfires in his area, hoping to deceive the Confederates as to his strength on that flank, and to disguise the fact that his flank was not anchored on an obstacle (the nearby Overall Creek). Thomas, in the center, was ordered to make a limited attack and act as the pivot for Crittenden&#x27;s wheel.

The armies bivouacked only from each other, and their bands started a musical battle that became a non-lethal preview of the next day&#x27;s events. Northern musicians played &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; and &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; and were answered by &quot;Dixie&quot; and &quot;The Bonnie Blue Flag.&quot; Finally, one band started playing &quot;Home! Sweet Home!&quot; and the others on both sides joined in. Thousands of Northern and Southern soldiers sang the sentimental song together across the lines.

The &quot;Cavalry Corps&quot;, under Brig. Gen. Joseph Wheeler Wheeler, consisted of brigades of Brig. Gens. Abraham Buford, John Pegram and John A. Wharton.

==Battle==

===December 31, 1862===
At dawn on December 31, about 6:00 a.m., Confederate William J. Hardee struck first, attacking the Union&#x27;s right flank with the division of Maj. Gen. John P. McCown, before many in Union Brig. Gen. Richard W. Johnson&#x27;s division had finished their breakfast. This was the third major battle, after Fort Donelson and Shiloh, in which an early morning attack caught a Union army by surprise. The 10,000 Confederates who massed on their left attacked in one massive wave. McCook&#x27;s deceptive campfires and the relative inexperience of McCown caused his division to drift away to the left, which left a gap in the front, but the gap was filled seamlessly by the division coming up from his rear, under Maj. Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne. These two divisions swept all resistance aside. Several artillery batteries were captured without having had time to fire a shot. Johnson&#x27;s division, on the right, suffered over 50% casualties. His neighboring Union division to the left, under Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, was able to hold only briefly.
Although meeting stiff resistance, Hardee drove the Union troops back three miles (5 km) to the railroad and the Nashville Pike by 10:00 a.m., where Johnson was able to rally them. Rosecrans canceled Crittenden&#x27;s attack on the Confederate right, which had begun with Brig. Gen. Horatio P. Van Cleve&#x27;s division crossing the river at 7:00 a.m., and instead rushed reinforcements to his own right flank. He had been slow to recognize the threat, assuming incorrectly that McCook would be capable of turning back Hardee&#x27;s assault. As Rosecrans raced across the battlefield directing units, seeming to be ubiquitous to his men, his uniform was covered with blood from his friend and chief of staff, Col. Julius Garesché, beheaded by a cannonball while riding alongside.
The second Confederate wave was composed of Polk&#x27;s corps, consisting of the divisions of Maj. Gens. Jones M. Withers and Benjamin F. Cheatham. What saved the Union from total destruction that morning was the foresight of Brig. Gen. Philip Sheridan (McCook&#x27;s wing), who anticipated an early attack and had the troops of his division up and ready in the center of the right half of the line by 4:00 a.m. Withers hit Sheridan&#x27;s right flank first (and Davis&#x27;s left) but was repulsed in three separate charges. Then Cheatham, with his reserve division, hit Sheridan&#x27;s front as Cleburne struck his flank. Cheatham&#x27;s assault was sluggish and piecemeal; observers claimed he had been drinking heavily and was unable to command his units effectively. While Sheridan&#x27;s men slowed the enemy advance, they did it at heavy cost to themselves; all three of Sheridan&#x27;s brigade commanders were killed that day, and more than one third of his men were casualties in four hours of fighting in a cedar forest surrounded on three sides that became known as &quot;The Slaughter Pen&quot;. By 10:00 a.m., many of the Confederate objectives had been achieved. They had captured 28 guns and over 3,000 Union soldiers.
Two Confederate blunders aided Rosecrans. Breckinridge, on the east side of the river, did not realize that Crittenden&#x27;s early morning attack had been withdrawn. He refused to send two brigades as reinforcements across the river to aid the main attack on the left. When Bragg ordered him to attack to his front—so that &quot;some&quot; use could be made of his corps—Breckinridge moved forward and was embarrassed to find out that there were no Union troops opposing him. At about that time, Bragg received a false report that a strong Union force was moving south along the Lebanon Turnpike in his direction. He canceled his orders that Breckinridge send reinforcements across the river, which diluted the effectiveness of the main attack.

By 11:00 a.m., Sheridan&#x27;s ammunition ran low, and his division pulled back, which opened a gap that Hardee exploited. The Union troops regrouped and held the Nashville Pike, supported by reinforcements and massed artillery. Repeated attacks on the left flank of the Union line were repulsed by Col. William B. Hazen&#x27;s brigade in a rocky, wooded area named &quot;Round Forest&quot; by the locals; it became known as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Half-Acre&quot;. Brig. Gen. Milo S. Hascall sent the 3rd Kentucky to the Round Forest as reinforcements. When he was informed that the 3rd&#x27;s regimental commander was dead, he decided to take personal command of the defensive position. He declared that it had to be held, &quot;even if it cost the last man we had&quot;. Hazen&#x27;s brigade was the only part of the original Union line to hold. The Union line was stabilized by the strong leadership of Rosecrans and by the rallying of the divisions under Johnson and Davis. The new line was roughly perpendicular to the original line, in a small half oval with its back to the river.

Bragg planned to attack the Union left, a portion of the oval line facing southeast, manned by Hazen&#x27;s brigade. The only troops available for such an assault were Breckinridge&#x27;s, and Bragg ordered him to cross the river, but Breckinridge moved slowly. By 4:00 p.m., Breckinridge&#x27;s first two brigades assaulted Hazen in piecemeal attacks and suffered heavy repulses. Two more brigades arrived, and they were sent in, reinforced by other elements of Polk&#x27;s corps. The attack failed a second time. Thomas responded with a limited counterattack that cleared his front. By 4:30 p.m., the battle was finished.
Bragg&#x27;s plan had had a fundamental flaw: although his objective was to cut Rosecrans&#x27;s line of communication (the Nashville Pike), his attack drove the Union defenders to concentrate at that point. Bragg&#x27;s biographer, Grady McWhiney, observed:

That night Rosecrans held a council of war to decide what to do. Some of his generals felt that the Union army had been defeated and recommended a retreat before they were entirely cut off. Rosecrans opposed this view and was strongly supported by Thomas and Crittenden. Thomas has been quoted by different sources in the council meeting as saying either &quot;This army does not retreat&quot; or &quot;There&#x27;s no better place to die.&quot; The decision was made to stand and fight, and as the Union line was reinforced, the morale of the soldiers rose.

On the Confederate side, Bragg was certain that he had won a victory. Although he had suffered 9,000 casualties, he was convinced that the large number of captured Union soldiers meant that Rosecrans had lost considerably more. The Confederate army began digging in, facing the Union line. Bragg sent a telegram to Richmond before he went to bed: &quot;The enemy has yielded his strong position and is falling back. We occupy [the] whole field and shall follow him. ... God has granted us a happy New Year.&quot;

===January 1–3, 1863===
At 3:00 a.m. on January 1, 1863, Rosecrans revived his original plan and ordered Van Cleve&#x27;s division (commanded by Col. Samuel Beatty following Van Cleve&#x27;s wounding the previous day) to cross the river and occupy the heights there, protecting two river crossing sites and providing a good platform for artillery. But the day was relatively quiet as both armies observed New Year&#x27;s Day by resting and tending to their wounded. Polk launched two probes of the Union line, one against Thomas, the other against Sheridan, to little effect.

In the rear, Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry continued to harass the Union line of communication on the turnpike back to Nashville. Convoys of wounded had to travel under heavy escort to be protected from the cavalry, and Wheeler interpreted these movements as preparations for a retreat, and he reported such to Bragg. Buoyed by his sense that he had won the battle, Bragg was content to wait for Rosecrans to retreat.

At 4:00 p.m. on January 2, Bragg directed Breckinridge&#x27;s troops to attack Beatty&#x27;s division, which was occupying the hill on the east side of the river. Breckinridge initially protested that the assault would be suicidal but eventually agreed and attacked with determination. The Union troops were pushed back across McFadden Ford, but the Confederate charge ran into heavy fire from massed Union artillery across the river, commanded by Crittenden&#x27;s artillery chief, Capt. John Mendenhall. Mendenhall deployed his guns perfectly—45 arrayed hub-to-hub on the ridge overlooking McFadden&#x27;s Ford and 12 more guns about a mile to the southwest, which could provide enfilading fire, completely commanding the opposite bank and heights beyond—and saved the day for Rosecrans. The Confederate attack stalled, having suffered over 1,800 casualties in less than an hour. A Union division under the command of James S. Negley (Thomas&#x27;s wing) led a counterattack at 4:45 p.m., and the Confederate troops retreated. Breckinridge was devastated by the disaster. He lost nearly one third of his Kentucky troops (Hanson&#x27;s Brigade, also known as the Orphan Brigade because it could not return to Union-occupied Kentucky). As he rode among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, &quot;My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans.&quot;

On the morning of January 3, a large supply train and reinforced infantry brigade led by Brig. Gen. James G. Spears reached Rosecrans. Wheeler&#x27;s cavalry attempted to capture the ammunition train that followed it but was repulsed. Late that evening, Thomas attacked the center of the Confederate line with two regiments in reaction to constant enemy sharpshooting against troops in his division under Lovell H. Rousseau. Thomas drove the Confederates from their entrenchments, taking about 30 prisoners. Despite this action, the main battle is generally accepted to have ended on January 2.

Bragg now knew that Rosecrans was not likely to retreat and would continue to receive reinforcements—the Confederates had only about 20,000 men ready to resume a battle and intelligence reports convinced Bragg that Rosecrans would soon have 70,000—and he knew that the miserable weather of freezing rain could raise the river enough to split his army. Beginning at 10:00 p.m. on January 3, he withdrew through Murfreesboro and began a retreat to Tullahoma, Tennessee, 36 miles (58 km) to the south. Rosecrans occupied Murfreesboro on January 5, but made no attempt to pursue Bragg. Rosecrans was quoted after the battle as saying, &quot;Bragg&#x27;s a good dog, but Hold Fast&#x27;s a better.&quot;

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
Total casualties in the battle were 25,645: 13,906 on the Union side and 11,739 for the Confederates, or 32.7% of all troops. Considering that only about 78,400 men were engaged, this was the highest percentage of casualties (3.8% killed, 19.8% wounded, and 7.9% missing/captured) of any major battle in the Civil War, higher in absolute numbers than the infamous bloodbaths at Shiloh and Antietam earlier that year. Four brigadier generals were killed or mortally wounded: Confederate James E. Rains and Roger W. Hanson; Union Edward N. Kirk and Joshua W. Sill. Frances Elizabeth Quinn was among the Union wounded, one of many female American Civil War soldiers.

===Effect on the Confederacy===
The battle was tactically inconclusive. Bragg received almost universal scorn from his Confederate military colleagues; only the support of Joseph E. Johnston and President Jefferson Davis&#x27;s inability to find a suitable replacement saved his command.

===Effect on the Union===
The battle was very important to Union morale, as evidenced by Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s letter to General Rosecrans: &quot;You gave us a hard-earned victory, which had there been a defeat instead, the nation could scarcely have lived over.&quot; The Confederate threat to Kentucky and Middle Tennessee had been nullified, and Nashville was secure as a major Union supply base for the rest of the war.

Rosecrans spent five and a half months reinforcing Murfreesboro. The massive earthenworks &quot;Fort Rosecrans&quot; was built there and served as a supply depot for the remainder of the war. The next major operation, the Tullahoma Campaign, did not come until June, when Rosecrans finally moved his army against Bragg.

==Battlefield preservation==

Part of the site of the Battle of Stones River and Fort Rosecrans is now Stones River National Battlefield. It contains the Hazen Brigade Monument, the nation&#x27;s oldest intact Civil War monument, erected in May 1863 by William Hazen&#x27;s brigade at Hell&#x27;s Half Acre. The 600 acre (2.4 km2) National Battlefield includes Stones River National Cemetery, established in 1865, with more than 6,000 Union graves. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield, some of which has been sold to the National Park Service and incorporated into the national battlefield.

<doc id="375962" wikidata="Q133479" url="?curid=375962" title="Lepisosteus">
<text>Lepisosteus (from Greek &quot;lepis&quot;, &#x27;scale&#x27; and &quot;osteos&quot;, &#x27;bone&#x27;) is a genus of gars in the family Lepisosteidae. It contains four extant species, found throughout eastern and central North America. It is one of two extant gar genera alongside &quot;Atractosteus.&quot;

== Distribution ==
&quot;Lepisosteus&quot; is known to be a freshwater fish. However, they do have the ability to survive in high salinity, and low oxygen water after gulping air. &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; prefers to reside in brackish and shallow slow-moving waters, living usually in schools. The habitat range of this genus ranges on the Eastern coast from the Gulf of Mexico in Florida north to Quebec. Habitats can be found in the Missouri River Basin and Mississippi River drainage area, westward in the Rio Grande River basin of Southern Texas and Northern Mexico. There are also populations in the Great Lakes except for Lake Superior. Their range can occasionally reach out towards the Mobile Bay, Perdido Bay, and Mississippi Sound.

&quot;Lepisosteus&quot; appears to have a wider distribution in the past, as the extinct species &quot;L. bemisi&quot; inhabited intermountain lakes in the Green River Formation of what is now Wyoming, significantly west of the genus&#x27;s modern range. The oldest record of the genus, a well-preserved skull from the Campanian, is known from the Oldman Formation of Canada. Even more removed from the genus&#x27;s present distribution was &quot;L. indicus&quot; from the Maastrichtian-aged Lameta Formation and Intertrappean Beds of India. This species&#x27; inclusion in &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; is uncertain, as it was classified based on characteristics of the skull that were later found to be shared among many different gar taxa. However, phylogenies include it as more closely related to &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; than to &quot;Atractosteus&quot; or fossil gars. Indeterminate gar remains, most likely of &quot;Lepisosteus&quot;, from the Palana Formation of India suggest that the genus may have persisted in India up to the Late Paleocene.

== Description ==
These fish have ganoid scales on their elongated bodies with a single dorsal fin on the posterior side approximately one inch from their caudal fin. Depending on the clarity of the water, &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; colors will change. In clear water they can have bright colors of green and silvery-white; alternatively if the water is brackish and cloudy, their colors will be more of a brown hue. Hatchlings are approximately 8–10 mm in size. The average full-grown length of &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; varies from 34 to 78 inches depending on the species. In comparison to their long snouts, &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; have relatively small heads; however, their mouths full of sharp teeth.

== Life history ==
&quot;Lepisosteus&quot; &quot;is a&quot; slow-growing genus generally living a long time. Female gars take 6 years to reach sexual maturity, grow larger, and live up to 22 years. Male gars reach maturity around 3 or 4 years after hatching. The males do not often live longer than 11 years. The longnose gar will migrate upstream to smaller streams with faster-moving water to spawn and lay eggs. Fish of this genus that are newly hatched will attach themselves vertically to submerged objects by an adhesive disc on their snout. The youth stay attached to the objects until the yolk sac is absorbed which usually takes about 9 days. After the yolk sac of an egg is absorbed, the roe hatches. Hatchlings stabilize to a horizontal position, take their first aerial breath, and begin feeding.

== Diet ==
Because &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; has evolved to be a top predator, they are voracious eaters that eat a variety of other freshwater fish and crustaceans such as &quot;Ictiobus&quot; and blue crabs. Adults will float toward the surface of streams to scout prey that are below them while younger fish in this genus will hide in submersed vegetation to ambush hunt. Studies have found this native North American species is a predator of invasive Asian carp, whose habitat they share. This genus is not generally used for recreational hunting because their roe is toxic to humans. There are no significant threats to these top predators other than habitat loss. On the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, this genus is listed as Least Concern.

==Taxonomy==

=== Evolution ===
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; is ancient genus that diverged from its only extant relative, &quot;Atractosteus&quot;, during the Early Cretaceous. As with &quot;Atractosteus&quot;, fossil evidence suggests that the ancestral range of the genus was likely centered around western North America during the Cretaceous and early Paleogene, until major climatic changes led to a shift in range to eastern North America by the late Paleogene.

===Species===
The currently recognized species are: &quot;Lepisosteus oculatus, Lepisosteus osseus, Lepisosteus platostomus, and Lepisosteus platyrhincus.&quot; Three species formerly classified in &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; (tropical gar, Cuban gar, and alligator gar) are now assigned to the genus &quot;Atractosteus&quot;.
==== Fossil species ====

According to Grande, 2010. In addition, an indeterminate record (known as &quot;&quot;Lepisosteus&quot; sp. A&quot;) is known from Campanian-aged Oldman Formation of Canada, and represents the oldest record of the genus.
* †&quot;Lepisosteus bemisi&quot; 
* †&quot;Lepisosteus&quot; &quot;indicus&quot; (classification in &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; uncertain, but most closely related to it)

<text>This article lists the clandestine networks, also known as circuits, (réseaux in French) established in France by F Section of the British Special Operations Executive during World War II. The SOE agents assigned to each network are also listed. SOE agents, with a few exceptions, were trained in the United Kingdom before being infiltrated into France. Some agents served in more than one network and are listed more than once.

The clandestine networks and agents were &quot;dedicated to encourage and aid resistance&quot; to the German occupation of the country. Activities included gathering intelligence, organizing and supplying indigenous resistance groups, and sabotaging transportation, communications, and industrial facilities. A typical SOE network had three agents: 1. Circuit organiser: leader, planner, and recruiter of new members. 2. Wireless Radio Operator: send and receive wireless messages to and from SOE headquarters in London, encode and decode messages, maintain wireless sets. 3. Courier or messenger: travel between organiser, wireless operator, and resistance groups to deliver and receive messages, and, on occasion, deliver explosives and other equipment. Large networks sometimes had more than one courier and wireless operator.

Each network was given a name and each agent belonging to the network had one or more code names and aliases which he used in France. For example, George Reginald Starr was the organiser of SOE&#x27;s Wheelwright network and known as &quot;Hilaire&quot; to French contacts in the Resistance and to other SOE personnel.

Nearly 50 SOE networks were operating in France during World War II. Forty-three circuits were no longer existent at the time that France was fully liberated from German control of which 31 had been destroyed by the Germans.

Approximately 470 SOE agents served in France during World War II. The Valençay SOE Memorial in Valençay, France lists the names of 91 men and 13 women who were killed, executed, or died in prison while serving as SOE agents.

==Networks and personnel==

All names of networks and dates for the operations of individual networks are from M. R. D. Foot&#x27;s &quot;SOE in France&quot; (2004), pages 466-467. Dates of network operations are inclusive; some networks had lengthy periods of inactivity within the dates cited. Individual agents may have served in more than one network or during only part of the time the network was operational.

==Map of networks as of June 1943==
The map below shows the major SOE F Section networks which existed in France in June 1943, based on the map published in Rita Kramer&#x27;s book &quot;Flames in the Field&quot; (Michael Joseph Ltd, 1995).

Note: The map does not show the correct location of the original Autogiro network, which operated in the Paris area and did not exist after the spring of 1942. However the network was later revived by Francis Suttill, organiser of Prosper.

==Operations==

===Asymptote===
Operation Asymptote was mounted in February 1944, while the Operational Instructions were quite clear, the disguised objective was to rescue two agents Émile Bollaert and Pierre Brossolette who had been captured on 2 February 1944 while trying to leave Brittany by boat. F. F. E. Yeo-Thomas (alias Shelley, alias Asymptote alias Cheval) and Maurice Lostrie (alias Trieur) were dropped on the night of 24 February 1944 by a RAF Halifax of 161 Squadron on DZ (Drop-zone) Sarrall, 16 km NE of Montluçon, Allier. Yeo-Thomas was captured by the Gestapo on 21 March 1944. Brossolette died while trying to escape the next day.

<doc id="375968" wikidata="Q2093907" url="?curid=375968" title="Manawatāwhi / Three Kings Islands">
<text>The Manawatāwhi / Three Kings Islands (Manawatāwhi is also the Māori name for the largest island) are a group of 13 uninhabited islands about northwest of Cape Reinga / Te Rerenga Wairua, New Zealand, where the South Pacific Ocean and Tasman Sea converge. They measure in area. The islands are on a submarine plateau, the Three Kings Bank, and are separated from the New Zealand mainland by an 8 km wide, 200 to 300 m deep submarine trough. Therefore, despite relative proximity to the mainland, the islands are listed with the New Zealand Outlying Islands. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any region or district, but instead &quot;Area Outside Territorial Authority&quot;, like all the other outlying islands except the Solander Islands.

==History==
During the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, most offshore islands of New Zealand were connected to the mainland. Manawatāwhi / Three Kings Islands, while connected to each other, were not connected to the rest of New Zealand. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, separating the individual islands in the group.

Manawatāwhi was traditionally settled by Muriwhenua Māori. In Māori mythology, Ōhau (West Island) is the final glimpse of New Zealand seen by departing spirits, after leaving the world at Cape Reinga / Te Rerenga Wairua. Some Te Aupōuri traditions associate the name of the island, Manawatāwhi (&quot;panting breath&quot;), with the ancestor Rauru, who swam to the islands and arrived exhausted. Members of Ngāti Kurī would periodically come to the islands as a refuge during times of warfare, and to harvest hāpuku, seabirds and eggs.

`Most of the larger islands were inhabited, and the Great Island was cleared by Māori of vegetation to grow tuber crops such as kūmara. No defensive pā sites are found on the island, likely as the people who lived on Manawatāwhi did not feel threatened due to the islands&#x27; distance from the mainland.

Dutch explorer Abel Tasman bestowed the name &quot;Drie Koningen Eyland&quot; (Three Kings Island) on 6 January 1643, three weeks after he became the first European known to have seen New Zealand. Tasman anchored at the islands when searching for water. As it was the Twelfth Night feast of the Epiphany, the day the biblical three kings known as the wise men visited Christ the child, he named the main island accordingly. Tasman also named a prominent cape &quot;Cape Maria van Diemen&quot;, after the wife of Anthony van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). These are the only two geographic features in New Zealand to retain the names given to them by Abel Tasman. Tasman noted a group of 30-35 inhabitants on the island when attempting to come ashore to replenish water supplies, and saw no trees on the island. Since Tasman&#x27;s visit, several European ships sighted the island, such as French botanist Jacques Labillardière on board the &quot;Recherche&quot; in 1793.

In the late 1700s, a party of mainland Te Aupōuri led by Taiakiaki travelled to the islands and killed the approximate 100 inhabitants, led by Toumaramara. Between 1800 and 1830 Te Aupōuri visited sporadically, however did not settle permanently. Tame Porena (also known as Tom Bowline) married Taiakiaki&#x27;s granddaughter, and settled on the islands with his family of twelve children in the 1830s and 1840s, establishing large gardens, until starvation forced them to relocate to the mainland. Since then, nobody has settled on the islands permanently. Botanist Thomas Frederic Cheeseman visited the islands in 1887 and 1889, documenting the plant species present on the islands for the first time. Cheeseman noted that the Great Island had begun to reforest since Māori settlement.

The islands were purchased by the New Zealand government in 1908 from seven Māori people, and declared an animal sanctuary in 1930. A population of goats (left on the Manawatāwhi Island in November 1889 as a food source for shipwrecked people) had run rampant, reaching numbers of 300-400 goats by 1900. This led Baden Powell of the Auckland War Memorial Museum, who visited in a group, to petition the government to deal with the goat population. In 1946 the goat population were shot and removed from the island, leading to the regeneration of forest on Manawatāwhi. However, 50 species described by Cheeseman in the 1880s have not been described again, and by the 1980s two plant species were only represented by one wild specimen. In 1956, the islands were declared a reserve for the preservation of flora and fauna.

There have been several notable research expeditions that have concentrated on studying the fauna and flora of the Three Kings island group including the Three Kings Islands expedition 1970.

==Geography==
The Three Kings group falls into two subgroups with four main inhospitable islands and a number of smaller rocks on a submarine plateau called King Bank which rises out of extremely deep water. There are no beaches. The surrounding sea has very clear visibility and contains teeming fish life, attracting hundreds of divers. Another attraction is the wreck of the &quot;Elingamite&quot; which foundered there on 9 November 1902.

===King Group===
====Manawatāwhi / Great Island====
With an area of , Manawatāwhi / Great Island is by far the largest island of the group. A northeastern peninsula, with an area of about 1 km2, is almost cut off by a 200 m wide but more than 80 m high isthmus formed by North West Bay and South East Bay. The island reaches an elevation of 295 m in the western part, while the peninsula is up to 184 m high near its western cliffs. The southern portion consists of the Tasman Valley, a series of rolling hills that drain into the Tasman Stream. Most of the Māori archaeological features on the islands are found in this area.


====Oromaki / North East Island====
A smaller island about in size and reaching a height of , approximately northeast of Manawatāwhi. The island is surrounded by 70-90m high cliffs. Māori stonework and terracing can be found on the island.

====Farmer Rocks====
Farmer Rocks, 0.8 km east of Manawatāwhi / Great Island, are 5 metres high and just a few hundred square metres in size.

===Southwest Group===
====Moekawa / South West Island====
The second largest island of the group, at and a height of . It is about 4.5 km southwest of Great island. The island is surrounded by 80-120m high cliffs.

====The Princes Islands====
The Princes Islands are seven small islets and numerous rocks with a total area of about 0.2 km2, start 600 m west of South West Island and stretch about 1.8 km east–west. The north-eastern islet is the highest at 106 m. The smallest islet is Rosemary Rock. These islands are sparsely vegetated.

====Ōhau / West Island====

The third largest island at 0.16 km2, found 500m southwest of the westernmost of the Princes Islands. It is 177m high, surrounded by 40-130m high cliffs. The island plays an important part in the traditional Māori belief that the spirits of dead Māori return to their Pacific homeland of Hawaiki. Near Cape Reinga on the mainland, sometimes translated as the underworld, is a gnarled Pōhutukawa tree reputed to be more than 800 years old. The spirits are believed to journey to the tree and down its roots into the sea bed. They are said to surface again on Ōhau and say a last farewell to New Zealand before going on to Hawaiki.

===Geology===
The islands have a volcanic origin.

==Flora and fauna==

=== Flora ===
In 1945, G. T. S. Baylis made a remarkable discovery on the Three Kings Islands, when he found the last remaining specimen anywhere of a tree which is now called &quot;Pennantia baylisiana&quot;, a kaikomako. It was recognised internationally as the world&#x27;s rarest and thus most endangered tree. Extremely careful propagation in New Zealand has resulted in the species being reliably established, but it continues to be carefully monitored. The islands were made a wildlife sanctuary in 1995. Other plants endemic to the islands include &quot;Tecomanthe speciosa&quot; and &quot;Elingamita johnsonii&quot;.

===Fauna===
The Three Kings have extremely high levels of endemism, even compared to other isolated islands. About 35% of its beetle species are found nowhere else, and there are six endemic genera: &quot;Gourlayia&quot; (Carabidae), &quot;Heterodoxa&quot; and &quot;Pseudopisalia&quot; (both Staphylinidae), &quot;Partystona&quot; and &quot;Zomedes&quot; (both Tenebrionidae) and &quot;Tribasileus&quot; (Anthribidae). There are probably another seven undescribed endemic genera. Falla&#x27;s skink (&quot;Oligosoma fallai&quot;) is a reptile species only found on these islands. Many marine invertebrates found around the islands are also endemic, such as the molluscs &quot;Haliotis pirimoana&quot; (Manawatāwhi pāua) and &quot;Penion lineatus&quot;.

===Geobiology===

There is considerable evidence that the Three Kings Islands have not been recently connected to the North Island landmass but have been connected to each other by land bridges. Genetic studies of different insect populations have suggested different separation times from similar species found in the North Island varying from 24 million years ago to 2.24 million years ago. Further, some species of these islands that are within eyeshot of northern New Zealand have stronger genetic links to species now found in Australia or New Caledonia or no genetic links to present New Zealand species. These include the flax snail, &quot;Placostylus bollonsi Suter&quot;

===Nature reserve===
Three Kings Island is a nature reserve administered by the Department of Conservation. Rats and mice were never introduced to the Three Kings, although goats were introduced to Great Island and caused significant damage to the vegetation and soil.

<doc id="375969" wikidata="Q157645" url="?curid=375969" title="DHL Group">
<text>Deutsche Post [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]] (), trading as DHL Group, is a German multinational package delivery and supply chain management company headquartered in Bonn, Germany. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest courier companies. The postal division, Deutsche Post, delivers 61 million letters each day in Germany, making it Europe&#x27;s largest such company. The trade name&#x27;s eponymous parcel division DHL is a wholly owned subsidiary claimed to be present in over 220 countries and territories. DHL Group was the largest logistics company worldwide in 2022.

DHL Group is the successor to the German mail authority Deutsche Bundespost, the oldest modern postal service in the world, tracing its roots to the middle ages. It was privatized in 1995 and became a fully independent company in 2000. Since its privatization, Deutsche Post has significantly expanded its business area through acquisitions. In late 2014, the group acquired StreetScooter GmbH, a small manufacturer of electric vehicles. Two years later, the group acquired UK Mail, a business-focused postal service in the UK for US$315.5 million (£243 million). The former company became a division of the Deutsche Post European parcel network.

The 2016 earnings of Deutsche Post DHL Group before interest and taxes (EBIT) was €3.491 billion (up 44.8 percent over 2015), with a net profit of €2.64 billion on revenue of €57.334 billion. Return on equity, before taxes, was 27.7 percent. The group&#x27;s long term credit rating, in November 2016, was BBB+ with a Stable outlook per Fitch&#x27;s.
DHL Group is listed on the Börse Frankfurt (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) as DHL and is in the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. In 2016, 20.5% of the group&#x27;s shares were held by the state-owned KfW bank; 79.5% were freely floating: 65.6% held by institutional and 10.8% by private investors.

== Recent history ==
DHL Group has become a large, world-wide company in about two decades. The following are significant dates in the development into its current form.
*2 January 1995: Deutsche Bundespost Postdienst becomes Deutsche Post AG; this is the company&#x27;s privatization. The government of Germany still owns a large share of the company; the state development bank KfW owns 50 percent.
*1998: Deutsche Post begins acquiring shares in DHL International. 
*1999: Deutsche Post World Net acquires the Dutch distribution company Van Gend &amp; Loos from Nedlloyd and in 2000 the Swiss distribution company Danzas. 
*20 November 2000: Deutsche Post AG becomes a fully private company, with a new board of directors, in an IPO listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The government of Germany sells one third of its shares and KfW bank sells some of its shares.
*December 2002: Deutsche Post AG acquires the remaining shares in DHL International.
*August 2003: The company acquires the Seattle-based Airborne Express (est. 1946). The company integrates Van Gend &amp; Loos, Danzas, Airborne Express, and its own EuroExpress into DHL to form DHL Express. 
*December 2005: The group acquires the logistics company Exel in the UK, a £3.7 billion (€5.5 billion) takeover; Exel provided transport for corporate customers.
*2006: DHL GlobalMail UK merges with Mercury International. 
*December 2014: The group acquires StreetScooter GmbH, a small manufacturer of electric vehicles in Aachen, Germany. 
*December 2016: The group completes the purchase of UK Mail, a business-focused postal service - &quot;one of the largest integrated parcels and mail operations in the U.K.&quot; - for US$315.5 (£243) million. The former company becomes a division of the Deutsche Post European parcel network, although its web site reveals only a relationship with DHL Express.
*February 2019: The group reaches an agreement with SF Express (SF Holding) for its supply chain operations in China.

== Corporate divisions ==

=== Post and parcel division ===

The postal division delivers approximately 61 million letters every working day in Germany, and provides services across the entire mail value chain, including production facilities at central hubs, sales offices and production centers on four continents.

This division inherited most of the traditional mail services formerly offered by the state-owned monopoly, for which it uses the Deutsche Post brand. Its exclusive right to deliver letters under 50 grams in Germany expired on 1 January 2008, following the implementation of European legislation. In 2002, Deutsche Post was granted a license to deliver mail in the United Kingdom, breaking Royal Mail&#x27;s long-standing monopoly.
In 2016, in Germany alone, the Post &amp; Parcel (P&amp;P) division delivered over 1.2 billion parcels, an increase of 9.3% over 2015, much of it as result of shipping products purchased by customers on-line. The e-commerce aspect helped to generate a great deal of revenue.

==Electric van manufacturing==
In December 2014, Deutsche Post DHL Group purchased StreetScooter GmbH, a small manufacturer of electric vehicles in Aachen, Germany. By April 2016, the company announced that it would produce 2,000 of the StreetScooter Work model in Aachen by year end.

The Work vehicle is equipped with lithium-ion battery packs and is powered by 30 kW asynchronous electric motors. The peak/continuous output is stated as 48 kW/38 kW. The range (before the need to recharge) is said to be 50 to 80 km, depending on the weight of the load and traffic conditions. The load capacity is 710 kg.

Deutsche Post&#x27;s 2016 annual report indicates that it plans to replace its fleet of delivery vehicles in Germany with the electric StreetScooter products &quot;in the medium term&quot;. Electric vans and trucks with a much greater range will be required to achieve the very long-term goal of replacing the group&#x27;s entire fleet of approximately 70,000 vehicles with electric StreetScooter vehicles.

A mass production plan was announced in April 2016. StreetScooter GmbH would be scaling up to manufacture approximately 10,000 vehicles annually, starting in 2017. If that goal is achieved, it will become Europe&#x27;s largest electric light utility vehicle manufacturer, surpassing Renault, which makes vans such as the Kangoo Z.E.

StreetScooter showed a larger prototype, the Work L, in September 2016 that will provide double the capacity in cargo size; its load capacity will be 1,000 kg. The range (before recharging is necessary) is estimated at &quot;up to 100 km&quot;. The company also announced that it was developing a Work Orange model with an &quot;electro-hydraulic three-way dumper&quot; for use by businesses that deal in trash or construction material handling. 
In 2021 plans for the sale of Streetscooter to Luxembourg-based Odin Automotive, now B-ON, were reported.

== Brands ==
*Deutsche Post – offers domestic mail services under its traditional name; the division is called Post - eCommerce - Parcel (PeP).
*DHL – brand used as an umbrella brand for worldwide logistics services.
*Power Packaging – supplier of food and beverage contract manufacturing and packaging services to North American companies.

<doc id="375974" wikidata="Q1072140" url="?curid=375974" title="Roman Republic (1849–1850)">
<text>The Roman Republic () was a short-lived state declared on 9 February 1849, when the government of the Papal States was temporarily replaced by a republican government due to Pope Pius IX&#x27;s departure to Gaeta. The republic was led by Carlo Armellini, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Aurelio Saffi. Together they formed a triumvirate, a reflection of a form of government during the first century BC crisis of the Roman Republic.

One of the major innovations the Republic hoped to achieve was enshrined in its constitution: freedom of religion, with Pope Pius IX and his successors guaranteed the right to govern the Catholic Church. These religious freedoms were quite different from the situation under the preceding government, which allowed only Catholicism and Judaism to be practised by its citizens. The Constitution of the Roman Republic was the first in the world to abolish capital punishment in its constitutional law.

==History==
===Start of the Republic===

On 15 November 1848, Pellegrino Rossi, the Minister of Justice of the Papal government, was assassinated. The following day, the liberals of Rome filled the streets, where various groups demanded a democratic government, social reforms and a declaration of war against the Austrian Empire to liberate long-held territories that were culturally and ethnically Italian. On the night of 24 November, Pope Pius IX left Rome disguised as an ordinary priest, and went out of the state to Gaeta, a fortress in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Before leaving, he had allowed the formation of a government led by Archbishop Carlo Emanuele Muzzarelli, to whom he wrote a note before leaving:
The government issued some liberal reforms which Pius IX rejected. When securely established in Gaeta, he organised a new government. A delegation was created by the High Council established by the Pope and the mayor of Rome, and sent to reassure the Pope and ask him to come back as soon as possible. This delegation was composed of the mayor himself, Prince Tommaso Corsini, three priests – Rezzi, Mertel and Arrighi – Marchese Paolucci de Calboli, doctor Fusconi and lawyer Rossi. However, they were stopped at the state boundary at Terracina. The Pope, informed of this, refused to speak to them. In Rome a &quot;Costituente Romana&quot; was formed on 29 November. 

Without a local government in Rome, for the first time in recent history, popular assemblies gathered. Margaret Fuller described the procession under a new flag, a &quot;tricolore&quot; sent from Venice, that set the flag in the hands of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius at the Campidoglio, and the angry popular reaction to papal warnings of excommunication for political actions of November received from Gaeta and posted on the 3rd. The &quot;Costituenti&quot; decided to schedule direct and universal elections (electors were all the citizens of the State, male and over 21 years old) on the following 21 January 1849. Since the pope had forbidden Catholics to vote at those elections (he considered the convocation of the election &quot;a monstrous act of felony made without a mask by the sponsors of the anarchic demagogy&quot;, an &quot;abnormal and sacrilegious attempt... deserving the punishments written both in the divine and the human laws&quot;), the resulting constitutional assembly (informally known as &quot;The Assembly of the Damned&quot;) had a republican inclination. In each and every part of the Papal States, less than 50% of the potential voters went to the polls.

The voters were not asked to express themselves on the parties but to vote for individuals. The lawyer Francesco Sturbinetti, who had led the Council of the Deputies, received the most votes, followed by Carlo Armellini, the physician Pietro Sterbini, Monsignor Carlo Emanuele Muzzarelli (in whose hands Pius had left the city), and Carlo Luciano Bonaparte, Prince of Canino. The aristocracy was represented by a prince, six marquises, fifteen counts and three other nobles. The new assembly was dominated by the bourgeoisie, the affluent, professionals and employees. It included twenty-seven owners, a banker, fifty-three jurists and lawyers, six graduates, twelve professors, two writers, twenty-one doctors, one pharmacist, six engineers, five employees, two merchants, nineteen military officers, one prior and one monsignore.

On 2 February 1849, at a political rally held in the Teatro Apollo, a young Roman ex-priest, the Abbé Arduini, made a speech in which he declared that the temporal power of the popes was a &quot;historical lie, a political imposture, and a religious immorality.&quot;

The Constitutional Assembly convened on 8 February and proclaimed the &quot;Roman Republic&quot; after midnight on 9 February. According to Jasper Ridley: &quot;When the name of Carlo Luciano Bonaparte, who was a member for Viterbo, was called, he replied to the roll-call by calling out &quot;Long live the Republic!&quot;&quot; (&quot;Viva la Repubblica!&quot;). That a Roman Republic was a foretaste of wider expectations was expressed in the acclamation of Giuseppe Mazzini as a Roman citizen.

When news reached the city of the decisive defeat of Piedmontese forces at the Battle of Novara (22 March), the Assembly proclaimed the &quot;Triumvirate&quot;, of Carlo Armellini (Roman), Giuseppe Mazzini (Roman) and Aurelio Saffi (from Teramo, Papal States), and a government, led by Muzzarelli and composed also by Aurelio Saffi (from Forlì, Papal States). Among the first acts of the Republic was the proclamation of the right of the Pope to continue his role as head of the Roman Church. The Triumvirate passed popular legislation to eliminate burdensome taxes and to give work to the unemployed.

Giuseppe Garibaldi formed the &quot;Italian Legion&quot;, with many recruits coming from Piedmont and the Austrian territories of Lombardy and Venetia, and took up a station at the border town of Rieti on the border with the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. There the legion rose to about 1,000 and gained discipline and organization.

The Pope asked for military help from Catholic countries. Saliceti and Montecchi left the Triumvirate; their places were filled on 29 March by Saffi and Giuseppe Mazzini, the Genoese founder of the journal &quot;La Giovine Italia&quot;, who had been the guiding spirit of the Republic from the start. Mazzini won friends among the poor by confiscating some of the Church&#x27;s large landholdings and distributing them to peasants. He inaugurated prison and insane asylum reforms, freedom of the press, and secular education, but shied away from the &quot;Right to Work&quot; or work guarantee programs for unemployed poor, having seen the compromise National Workshops measure of Louis Blanc fail in France shortly before.
However, the government&#x27;s policies (lower taxes, increased spending) were fiscally expansionary and involved a decrease in the value of the currency. 

Piedmont was at risk of attack by Austrian forces, and the Republic&#x27;s movement of troops in the area was a threat to Austria (which was certainly capable of attacking Rome itself). The commander-in-chief of Austrian forces in Milan, Count Joseph Radetzky von Radetz, had remarked during the &quot;Five Glorious Days&quot; of Milan, &quot;Three days of blood will give us thirty years of peace&quot;.

But the Roman Republic would fall to another, unexpected enemy. In France, newly elected President Louis Napoleon, who would soon declare himself emperor Napoleon III, was torn. He himself had participated in an insurrection in the Papal States against the Pope in 1831, but at this point, he was under intense pressure from ultramontane French Catholics, who had voted overwhelmingly for him. Additionally, an intervention into Rome would expand French influence in Italy while weakening Habsburg influence, both being foreign policy goals of Louis Napoleon. Thus, though he hesitated to betray Italian liberals, Louis Napoleon ultimately decided to send French troops to restore the Pope.

===French siege===
On 25 April, 1849, some eight to ten thousand French troops under General Charles Oudinot landed at Civitavecchia on the coast northwest of Rome, while Spain sent 4,000 men under Fernando Fernández de Córdova to Gaeta, where the Pope remained in his refuge. The French sent a staff officer the next day to meet with Giuseppe Mazzini with a stiff assertion that the pope would be restored to power. The revolutionary Roman Assembly, amid thunderous shouts of &quot;Guerra!, Guerra!&quot;, authorised Mazzini to resist the French by force of arms.

The French expected little resistance from the usurpers. But republican resolve was stiffened by the charismatic Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s long-delayed triumphal entry into Rome at last, on 27 April, and by the arrival on 29 April of the Lombard Bersaglieri, who had recently driven the Austrians from the streets of Milan with new tactics of house-to-house fighting. Hasty defences were erected on the Janiculum wall, and the villas on the city&#x27;s outskirts were garrisoned. On 30 April, Oudinot&#x27;s out-of-date maps led him to march to a gate that had been walled up sometime before. The first cannon shot was mistaken for the noon-day gun, and the astonished French were beaten back by the fiercely anti-clerical Romans of Trastevere, Garibaldi&#x27;s legionaries and citizen-soldiers, who sent them back to the sea. But despite Garibaldi&#x27;s urging, Mazzini was loath to follow up their advantage, as he had not expected an attack by the French and hoped that the Roman Republic could befriend the French Republic. The French prisoners were treated as &quot;ospiti della guerra&quot; (&quot;guests of war&quot;) and sent back with republican tracts citing Article V of the most recent French constitution: &quot;France respects foreign nationalities. Her might will never be employed against the liberty of any people&quot;.

As a result, Oudinot was able to regroup and await reinforcements; time proved to be on his side, and Mazzini&#x27;s attempt at diplomacy proved fatal to the Roman Republic. A letter from Louis Napoleon encouraged Oudinot and assured him of French reinforcements. The French government sent Ferdinand de Lesseps to negotiate a more formal ceasefire. Neapolitan troops sympathetic to the papacy entered Roman Republic territory, and de Lesseps suggested that Oudinot&#x27;s forces in their current position might protect the city from the converging approach of an Austrian army with the Neapolitan force: the Roman Triumvirate agreed. Many Italians from outside the Papal States went to Rome to fight for the Republic: among them was Goffredo Mameli, who had tried to form a common state joining the Roman Republic and Tuscany, and who died of a wound suffered in the defence of Rome.

The siege began in earnest on 1 June, and despite the resistance of the Republican army, led by Garibaldi, the French prevailed on 29 June. On 30 June the Roman Assembly met and debated three options: to surrender; to continue fighting in the streets of Rome; to retreat from Rome and continue the resistance from the Apennine Mountains. Garibaldi made a speech in which he favoured the third option and then said: &quot;Dovunque saremo, colà sarà Roma.&quot; (&quot;Wherever we may be, there will be Rome!&quot;).

A truce was negotiated on 1 July and on 2 July Garibaldi, followed by some 4,000 troops, withdrew from Rome for refuge in the neutral Republic of San Marino. The French Army entered Rome on 3 July and reestablished the Holy See&#x27;s temporal power. In August Louis Napoleon issued a sort of manifesto in which he asked of Pius IX a general amnesty, a secularized administration, the establishment of the Code Napoléon, and in general a Liberal Government. Pius, from Gaeta, promised reforms that he declared &quot;motu proprio&quot;, that is, of his own volition, not in answer to the French.

The pope did not return to Rome itself until April 1850, since the French were considered liberals all the same, and the pope would not return until assured of no French meddling in his affairs. In the interim, Rome was governed by a reactionary &quot;Red Triumvirate&quot; of cardinals. French soldiers propped up the papal administration in Rome until they were withdrawn at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, leading to the subsequent capture of Rome and annexation by the Kingdom of Italy.

According to Raffaele De Cesare:
The Roman question was the stone tied to Napoleon&#x27;s feet – that dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, even in August 1870, a month before Sedan, that he was a sovereign of a Catholic country, that he had been made emperor, and was supported by the votes of the conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was his supreme duty not to abandon the pontiff. […] For twenty years Napoleon III had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and relations […] Without him the temporal power would never have been reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured.&quot;

<text>William Starke Rosecrans (September 6, 1819March 11, 1898) was an American inventor, coal-oil company executive, diplomat, politician, and U.S. Army officer. He gained fame for his role as a Union general during the American Civil War. He was the victor at prominent battles in the Western theater of the American Civil War. However, his military career ended after his disastrous defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863.

Rosecrans graduated in 1842 from the United States Military Academy, where he served in engineering assignments and was a professor before leaving the Army to pursue a career in civil engineering. At the start of the Civil War, he led troops from Ohio and achieved early combat success in western Virginia. In 1862, in the Western theater, he won the Battle of Iuka and the Second Battle of Corinth while under the command of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. His brusque, outspoken manner and willingness to quarrel openly with superiors caused a professional rivalry with Grant (as well as with Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton) that would adversely affect Rosecrans&#x27; career.

Given command of the Army of the Cumberland, he fought against Confederate general Braxton Bragg at Stones River. He then outmaneuvered him in the brilliant Tullahoma campaign, driving the Confederates from Middle Tennessee. His strategic movements then caused Bragg to abandon the critical city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, but Rosecrans&#x27; pursuit of Bragg ended during the bloody Battle of Chickamauga, where his unfortunately worded order mistakenly opened a gap in the Union line and Rosecrans and a third of his army was swept from the field. Besieged in Chattanooga, Rosecrans was relieved of command by Grant.

Following his humiliating defeat, Rosecrans was reassigned to command the Department of Missouri, where he opposed Price&#x27;s Raid. After the war, he served in diplomatic and appointed political positions and in 1880 was elected to Congress, representing California.

==Early life and education==
William Starke Rosecrans was born on a farm near Little Taylor Run in Kingston Township, Delaware County, Ohio, the second of five sons of Crandall Rosecrans and Jemima Hopkins. (The first child, Chauncey, died in infancy.) Crandall was a veteran of the War of 1812, in which he served as adjutant to General William Henry Harrison, and then subsequently ran a tavern and store as well as a family farm. One of Crandall&#x27;s heroes, General John Stark, was the inspiration for William&#x27;s middle name. Rosecrans was descended from the Dutch-Scandinavian nobleman Harmon Henrik Rosenkrantz (1614–1674), who arrived in New Amsterdam in 1651, but the family name changed spelling during the American Revolutionary War. His mother was the widow of Timothy Hopkins, a relative of Stephen Hopkins, the Colonial Governor of Rhode Island and a signer of the Declaration of Independence.

William had little formal education in his early years, relying heavily on reading books. At the age of 13, he left home to work as a store clerk in Utica, and later Mansfield, Ohio. Unable to afford college, Rosecrans decided to try for an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He interviewed with Congressman Alexander Harper, who had been reserving his appointment for his son, but Harper was so impressed by Rosecrans that he nominated him instead.

Despite his lack of formal education, Rosecrans excelled academically at West Point, particularly in mathematics, French, drawing, and English grammar. At the academy, he received his nickname, &quot;Rosy,&quot; or more often, &quot;Old Rosy.&quot; He graduated from West Point in 1842, fifth in his class of 56 cadets, which included notable future generals such as James Longstreet, Abner Doubleday, Daniel Harvey &quot;D. H.&quot; Hill, and Earl Van Dorn. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the prestigious United States Army Corps of Engineers, reflecting his high academic achievement. At his graduation, he met Anna Elizabeth (or Eliza) Hegeman (1823–1883) of New York City and immediately fell in love. They were married on August 24, 1843. Their marriage lasted until her death on December 25, 1883. They had eight children.

==Career==
After graduating from West Point, Rosecrans was assigned to duty at Fort Monroe, Virginia, engineering sea walls. After a year, he requested assignment as a professor at West Point, where he taught engineering and served as post commissary and quartermaster. Although West Point was a strong bastion of Episcopal Protestantism, during this assignment, he converted to Catholicism in 1845. He wrote about this decision to his family, who had raised him in the Methodist faith, which inspired the youngest of his brothers, Sylvester Horton Rosecrans, to convert as well. Sylvester would become the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Columbus. 
Ultimately, both of Rosecrans&#x27;s parents had deathbed conversions to Catholicism. According to University of Virginia historian William B. Kurtz, “unlike many men of his era content to leave religion to (that of) their wives, he played the central role in his family’s faith life.&quot;

Although most of the officers in his graduating class fought in the Mexican–American War, the War Department retained Rosecrans at West Point. From 1847 through 1853, he served on engineering assignments in Newport, Rhode Island, New Bedford, Massachusetts and (on temporary assignment to the United States Navy) at the Washington Navy Yard. During this period, Rosecrans sought several civilian jobs as an alternative way to support his growing family, now with four children. He applied for a professorship at the Virginia Military Institute in 1851, losing the position to fellow West Pointer Thomas J. Jackson.

While serving in Newport, Rhode Island, he volunteered his services as the engineer for the construction of St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church. The church is best known as the site of the wedding of John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Bouvier in 1953 and was one of the largest churches constructed in the United States at that time. There is a memorial window in Rosecrans&#x27; honor in the church.

Rosecrans suffered a period of failing health and resigned from the Army in 1854, moving into civilian fields. He took over a mining business in Western Virginia (today West Virginia) and ran it extremely successfully. He designed and installed one of the first complete lock and dam systems in Western Virginia on the Coal River; today recognized as the Coal River Locks, Dams, and Log Booms Archeological District. In Cincinnati, he and two partners built one of the first oil refineries west of the Allegheny Mountains. He obtained patents for many inventions, including the first kerosene lamp to successfully burn a round wick and a more effective method of manufacturing soap. While Rosecrans was president of the Preston Coal Oil Company, in 1859, he was burned severely when an experimental &quot;safety&quot; oil lamp exploded, setting the refinery on fire. It took him 18 months to recover, and the resulting facial scars, most of which would later be covered by his beard, gave him the appearance of having a perpetual smirk. He had recovered from his injuries and was working to get the company in order when the Civil War began.

===American Civil War===
Just days after Fort Sumter surrendered, Rosecrans offered his services to Ohio Governor William Dennison Jr., who assigned him as a volunteer aide-de-camp to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, who commanded all Ohio volunteer forces at the beginning of the war. Promoted to the rank of colonel, Rosecrans briefly commanded the 23rd Ohio Infantry Regiment, whose members included Rutherford B. Hayes and William McKinley, both future presidents. He was promoted to brigadier general in the Regular Army, ranking from May 16, 1861.

His plans and decisions proved extremely effective in the Western Virginia Campaign. His victories at Rich Mountain and Corrick&#x27;s Ford in July 1861 were among the first Union victories of the war, but his superior, Maj. Gen. McClellan, received the credit. Rosecrans then prevented by &quot;much maneuvering but little fighting&quot; Confederate Brig. Gen. John B. Floyd and his superior, Gen. Robert E. Lee, from recapturing the area that became the state of West Virginia. When McClellan was summoned to Washington after the defeat suffered by Federal forces at the First Battle of Bull Run, General-in-Chief Winfield Scott suggested that McClellan turn over the West Virginia command to Rosecrans. McClellan agreed, and Rosecrans assumed command of the future Department of Western Virginia.

In late 1861, Rosecrans planned for a winter campaign to capture the strategic town of Winchester, Virginia, turning the Confederate flank at Manassas, Virginia. He traveled to Washington to obtain McClellan&#x27;s approval. McClellan disapproved, however, telling Rosecrans that putting 20,000 Union men into Winchester would be countered by Confederates moving an equal number into the vicinity. He also transferred 20,000 of Rosecrans&#x27;s 22,000 men to serve under Brig. Gen. Frederick W. Lander, leaving Rosecrans with insufficient resources to do any campaigning. In March 1862, Rosecrans&#x27;s department was converted to the Mountain Department and given to political general John C. Frémont, leaving Rosecrans without a command. He served briefly in Washington, where his opinions clashed with those of newly appointed Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton on tactics and Union command organization for the Shenandoah Valley campaign against Stonewall Jackson. Stanton became one of Rosecrans&#x27;s most vocal critics. One of Stanton&#x27;s assignments for Rosecrans was to act as a guide for Brig. Gen. Louis Blenker&#x27;s division (Frémont&#x27;s department) in the valley, and Rosecrans became intimately involved in the political and command confusion in the campaign against Jackson in the Valley.

====Western Theater====
Rosecrans was transferred in May 1862 to the Western theater and received the command of two divisions (the Right Wing) of Maj. Gen. John Pope&#x27;s Army of the Mississippi. He took an active part in the siege of Corinth under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck. He received command of the entire army on June 26, and in July, added the responsibility of commanding the District of Corinth. In these roles, he was the subordinate of Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, who commanded the District of Western Tennessee and the Army of the Tennessee, from whom he received direction in the Iuka-Corinth campaign in September and October 1862.

====Iuka====
Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price had been ordered by Gen. Braxton Bragg to move his army from Tupelo toward Nashville, Tennessee, in conjunction with Bragg&#x27;s Kentucky offensive. Price&#x27;s army settled in Iuka and awaited the arrival of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn&#x27;s Army of West Tennessee. The two generals intended to unite and attack Grant&#x27;s lines of communication in western Tennessee, which would prevent Buell&#x27;s reinforcement if Grant reacted the way they expected, or might allow them to follow Bragg and support his Northern invasion if Grant acted more passively.

Grant did not wait to be attacked, approving a plan proposed by Rosecrans to converge on Price with two columns before Van Dorn could reinforce him. Grant sent Brig. Gen. Edward Ord with three Army of the Tennessee divisions (about 8,000 men) along the Memphis and Charleston Railroad to move upon Iuka from the northwest. Rosecrans&#x27;s army would march in concert along the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, swinging into Iuka from the southwest, closing the escape route for Price&#x27;s army. Grant moved with Ord&#x27;s headquarters and had little tactical control over Rosecrans during the battle.

While Ord advanced toward Iuka on the night of September 18, Rosecrans was late, having farther to march over roads mired in mud; furthermore, one of his divisions took a wrong turn and had to countermarch to the correct road. That night, he notified Grant that he was away, but planned to start marching again at 4:30 a.m. and should reach Iuka by midafternoon on September 19. Considering this delay, Grant ordered Ord to move within of the town, but to await the sound of fighting between Rosecrans and Price before engaging the Confederates. Rosecrans&#x27; army marched early on September 19, but instead of using two roads as originally planned, it took only one of them. Rosecrans was concerned that if he used both roads, the two halves of his divided force could not support each other if the Confederates attacked.

Rosecrans was within of the town on September 19, pushing back Confederate pickets, when his lead element was struck suddenly by a Confederate division. Fighting, which Price later stated he had &quot;never seen surpassed,&quot; continued from 4:30 p.m. until after dark. A fresh north wind, blowing from Ord&#x27;s position in the direction of Iuka, caused an acoustic shadow that prevented the sound of the guns from reaching him, and he and Grant knew nothing of the engagement until after it was over. Ord&#x27;s troops stood idly while the fighting raged only a few miles away.

During the night, both Rosecrans and Ord deployed their forces in the expectation of a renewal of the engagement at daylight, but the Confederate forces had withdrawn. Price had been planning this move since September 18, and Rosecrans&#x27;s attack merely delayed his departure. The Confederates used the road that the Union army had not blocked, meeting up with Van Dorn&#x27;s army five days later. Rosecrans&#x27;s cavalry and some infantry pursued Price for , but owing to the exhausted condition of his troops, his column was outrun and he gave up the pursuit. Grant had partially accomplished his objective—Price was not able to link up with Bragg in Kentucky, but Rosecrans had not been able to destroy the Confederate army or prevent it from linking up with Van Dorn and threatening the critical railroad junction at Corinth.

The Battle of Iuka marked the beginning of a long professional enmity between Rosecrans and Grant. The Northern press gave accounts very favorable to Rosecrans at Grant&#x27;s expense. Some rumors circulated that the reason Ord&#x27;s column had not attacked in conjunction with Rosecrans was not that the battle had been inaudible, but that Grant had been drunk and incompetent. Grant&#x27;s first report of the battle was highly complimentary to Rosecrans, but his second, written after Rosecrans had published his own report, took a markedly negative turn. His third statement was in his &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;, where he wrote &quot;I was disappointed at the result of the battle of Iuka—but I had so high an opinion of General Rosecrans that I found no fault at the time.&quot;
====Corinth====
Price&#x27;s army joined Van Dorn&#x27;s on September 28. Van Dorn, as the senior officer, took command of the combined force. Grant became certain that Corinth was their next target. The Confederates hoped to seize Corinth from an unexpected direction, isolating Rosecrans from reinforcements, and then sweep into Middle Tennessee. Grant sent word to Rosecrans to be prepared for an attack, but despite the warning, Rosecrans was not convinced that Corinth was necessarily the target of Van Dorn&#x27;s advance. He believed that the Confederate commander would not be foolhardy enough to attack the fortified town and might well instead choose to strike the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and maneuver the Federals out of their position.

On the morning of October 3, three of Rosecrans&#x27;s divisions advanced into old Confederate rifle pits north and northwest of town. Van Dorn began his assault at 10 a.m. as a planned double envelopment, in which he would open the fight on Rosecrans&#x27;s left, in the hope that Rosecrans would weaken his right to reinforce his left, at which time Price would make the main assault against the Federal right and enter the works. The Confederates forced their way through a temporary gap in the line about 1:30 p.m., and the whole Union line fell back to within half a mile of the redoubts.

So far the advantage had been with the Confederates. Rosecrans had been driven back at all points, and night found his entire army, except pickets, inside the redoubts. Both sides had been exhausted by the fighting. The weather had been hot, with a high of , and water was scarce, causing many men to nearly faint from their exertions. Rosecrans&#x27;s biographer, William M. Lamers, reported that Rosecrans was confident at the end of the first day of battle, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve got them where we want them&quot;, and that some of the general&#x27;s associates claimed that he was in &quot;magnificent humor.&quot; Peter Cozzens, however, suggested that Rosecrans was &quot;tired and bewildered, certain only he was badly outnumbered—at least three to one by his reckoning.&quot; Civil War historian Steven E. Woodworth portrayed Rosecrans&#x27;s conduct in a negative light:
On the second day of battle, the Confederates moved forward at 9 a.m. to meet heavy Union artillery fire, storming Battery Powell and Battery Robinett, where desperate hand-to-hand fighting occurred. A brief incursion into the town of Corinth was repulsed. After a Federal counterattack recaptured Battery Powell, Van Dorn ordered a general retreat. At 4 p.m., reinforcements from Grant under the command of Brig. Gen. James B. McPherson arrived from Jackson. But the Battle of Corinth had effectively been over since 1 p.m. and the Confederates were in full retreat.

Once again, Rosecrans&#x27;s performance during the second day of the battle has been the subject of dispute among historians. His biographer, Lamers, paints a romantic picture:

Peter Cozzens, author of a recent book-length study of Iuka and Corinth, came to the opposite conclusion:

Rosecrans&#x27;s performance immediately after the battle was lackluster. Grant had given him specific orders to pursue Van Dorn without delay, but he did not begin his march until the morning of October 5, explaining that his troops needed rest and the thicketed country made progress difficult by day and impossible by night. At 1 p.m. on October 4, when pursuit would have been most effective, Rosecrans rode along his line to deny in person a rumor that he had been slain. At Battery Robinett, he dismounted, bared his head, and told his soldiers, &quot;I stand in the presence of brave men, and I take my hat off to you.&quot;

====Army of the Cumberland====

Rosecrans once again found that he was a hero in the Northern press. On October 24, he was given command of XIV Corps (which, because he was also given command of the Department of the Cumberland, would soon be renamed the Army of the Cumberland), replacing the ineffectual Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, who had just fought the inconclusive Battle of Perryville, Kentucky, against Gen. Braxton Bragg, but was accused of moving too cautiously. Rosecrans was promoted to the rank of major general (of volunteers, as opposed to his brigadier rank in the regular army). The promotion was applied retroactive to March 21, 1862, so that he would outrank fellow Maj. Gen. Thomas; Thomas had earlier been offered Buell&#x27;s command, but turned down the opportunity out of a sense of personal loyalty. Grant was not unhappy that Rosecrans was leaving his command.

In his role as an army commander, Rosecrans became one of the most popular generals in the Union Army. He was known to his men as &quot;Old Rosy&quot;, not only because of his last name (the source for that nickname at West Point), but because of his large red nose, which was described as &quot;intensified Roman&quot;. As a devout Catholic, he carried a crucifix on his watch chain and a rosary in his pocket, and he delighted in keeping his staff up half the night debating religious doctrine. He could swing swiftly from bristling anger to good-natured amusement, which endeared him to his men.

====Stones River====

Rosecrans&#x27;s predecessor, Buell, had been relieved because of his desultory pursuit of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg following the Battle of Perryville. And yet, Rosecrans displayed similar caution, remaining in Nashville while he reprovisioned his army and improved the training of his cavalry forces. By early December 1862, General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck had lost his patience. He wrote to Rosecrans, &quot;If you remain one more week in Nashville, I cannot prevent your removal.&quot; Rosecrans replied, &quot;I need no other stimulus to make me do my duty than the knowledge of what it is. To threats of removal or the like I must be permitted to say that I am insensible.&quot;

In late December, Rosecrans began his march against Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee, encamped outside Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Battle of Stones River was the bloodiest battle of the war in terms of percentages of casualties. Both Rosecrans and Bragg planned to attack the other&#x27;s right flank, but Bragg moved first, early in the morning of December 31, driving the Union army back into a small defensive perimeter. As he realized the severity of the surprise attack, Rosecrans demonstrated the nervous hyperactivity for which he was known in battle. He personally rallied his men along the line, and gave direct orders to any brigades, regiments or companies he encountered. Disregarding his own safety, he rode back and forth at the very front of his line and sometimes between his men and the enemy. As Rosecrans raced across the battlefield directing units, seeming ubiquitous to his men, his uniform was covered with blood from his friend and chief of staff, Col. Julius Garesché, beheaded by a cannonball while riding alongside.

The armies paused on January 1, but the following day, Bragg attacked again, this time against a strong position on Rosecrans&#x27;s left flank. The Union defense was formidable, and the attack was repulsed with heavy losses. Bragg withdrew his army to Tullahoma, effectively ceding control of Middle Tennessee to the Union. The battle was important to Union morale following its defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg a few weeks earlier, and President Abraham Lincoln wrote to Rosecrans. &quot;You gave us a hard-earned victory, which had there been a defeat instead, the nation could scarcely have lived over.&quot;
====Tullahoma====

Rosecrans&#x27;s XIV Corps was soon redesignated the Army of the Cumberland, which he kept in place occupying Murfreesboro for almost six months, spending the time resupplying and training, for he was reluctant to advance on the muddy winter roads. He received numerous entreaties from President Lincoln, Secretary of War Stanton, and General-in-Chief Halleck to resume campaigning against Bragg, but rebuffed them through the winter and spring. A primary concern of the government was that if Rosecrans continued to sit idly, the Confederates might move units from Bragg&#x27;s army in an attempt to relieve the pressure that Union Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was applying to Vicksburg, Mississippi. Lincoln wrote to Rosecrans, &quot;I would not push you to any rashness, but I am very anxious that you do your utmost, short of rashness, to keep Bragg from getting lost to help Johnston against Grant.&quot; Rosecrans offered an excuse that if he started to move against Bragg, Bragg would likely relocate his entire army to Mississippi and threaten Grant&#x27;s Vicksburg Campaign even more; thus, by not attacking Bragg, he was helping Grant. Frustration with Rosecrans&#x27;s excuses led Halleck to threaten to relieve him if he did not move, but in the end he merely protested &quot;against the expense to which [Rosecrans] put the government for telegrams.&quot;

On June 2, Halleck telegraphed that if Rosecrans was unwilling to move, some of his troops would be sent to Mississippi to reinforce Grant. Rosecrans sent a questionnaire to his corps and division commanders in the hopes of documenting support for his position—that Bragg had so far detached no significant forces to Mississippi, that advancing the Army of the Cumberland would do nothing to prevent any such transfer, and that any immediate advance was not a good idea. Fifteen of the seventeen senior generals supported most of Rosecrans&#x27;s positions and the counsel against advancing was unanimous. The only dissenter was the newly assigned chief of staff, Brig. Gen. James A. Garfield, who recommended an immediate advance, but historian Steven E. Woodworth opines that he may have been &quot;most concerned with the [political] impression his statement would make in Washington.&quot; On June 16, Halleck wired a blunt message: &quot;Is it your intention to make an immediate movement forward? A definite answer, yes or no, is required.&quot; Rosecrans responded to this ultimatum: &quot;If immediate means tonight or tomorrow, no. If it means as soon as all things are ready, say five days, yes.&quot; Seven days later, early in the morning of June 24, Rosecrans reported that the Army of the Cumberland had begun to move against Bragg.

The Tullahoma Campaign (June 24 – July 3, 1863) was characterized by flawless maneuvers and very low casualties, as Rosecrans forced Bragg to retreat back to Chattanooga. Tullahoma is considered a &quot;brilliant&quot; campaign by many historians. Abraham Lincoln wrote, &quot;The flanking of Bragg at Shelbyville, Tullahoma and Chattanooga is the most splendid piece of strategy I know of.&quot; Union Cavalry Corps commander David S. Stanley wrote, &quot;If any student of the military art desires to make a study of a model campaign, let him take his maps and General Rosecrans&#x27;s orders for the daily movements of his campaign. No better example of successful strategy was carried out during the war than in the Tullahoma campaign.&quot;

When Rosecrans&#x27; troops entered Shelbyville, they were able to rescue captured Union spy Pauline Cushman. Cushman had been scouting the movements of Gen. Bragg when she was captured (Gen. John Hunt Morgan was one of her escorts to Gen. Bragg for questioning). A military trial found her guilty; she was to be hanged as a spy. Her rescue came just three days prior to her scheduled execution. Rosecrans and Cushman went on to raise over one million dollars for soldiers aid at the 1863 Cincinnati, Ohio Sanitary Fair. In contrast, Rosecrans had approved the courtmartial and hanging of two Confederate Officers, Lawrence Orton Williams and Walter Peters, on June 9, 1863, at Franklin Tenn after these two officers had disguised themselves as Union Officers for the purposes of spying.

Rosecrans did not receive all of the public acclaim his campaign might have under different circumstances. The day it ended was the day Gen. Robert E. Lee launched the ill-fated Pickett&#x27;s Charge and lost the Battle of Gettysburg. The following day, Vicksburg surrendered to Grant. Secretary Stanton telegraphed Rosecrans, &quot;Lee&#x27;s Army overthrown; Grant victorious. You and your noble army now have a chance to give the finishing blow to the rebellion. Will you neglect the chance?&quot; Rosecrans was infuriated by this attitude and responded, &quot;Just received your cheering telegram announcing the fall of Vicksburg and confirming the defeat of Lee. You do not appear to observe the fact that this noble army has driven the rebels from middle Tennessee. ... I beg in behalf of this army that the War Department may not overlook so great an event because it is not written in letters of blood.&quot;

====Chickamauga====
Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and &quot;give the finishing blow to the rebellion&quot; as Stanton had urged. He paused to regroup and study the logistically difficult choices of pursuit into the mountainous regions to the west and south of Chattanooga. When he was ready to move, he once again maneuvered in a way to disadvantage Bragg. The Confederates abandoned Chattanooga and withdrew into the mountains of northwestern Georgia. Rosecrans threw aside his previous caution under the assumption that Bragg would continue to retreat and began to pursue with his army over three routes that left his corps commanders dangerously far apart. At the Battle of Davis&#x27;s Cross Roads on September 11, Bragg came close to ambushing and destroying one of Rosecrans&#x27;s isolated corps. Realizing the threat at last, Rosecrans issued urgent orders to concentrate his army, and the two opponents faced each other across West Chickamauga Creek.
The Battle of Chickamauga began on September 19 with Bragg attacking the not fully concentrated Union army, but he was unable to break through Rosecrans&#x27;s defensive positions. On the second day of battle, however, disaster befell Rosecrans in the form of his poorly worded order in response to a poorly understood situation. The order was directed to Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, &quot;to close up and support [General Joseph J.] Reynolds&#x27;s [division],&quot; planning to fill an assumed gap in the line. However, Wood&#x27;s subsequent movement actually opened up a new, division-sized gap in the line. By coincidence, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet had planned to lead a massive assault in that very area and the Confederates exploited the gap to full effect, shattering Rosecrans&#x27;s right flank.

The majority of units on the Union right fell back in disorder toward Chattanooga. Rosecrans, Garfield, and two of the corps commanders, although attempting to rally retreating units, soon joined them in the rush to safety. Rosecrans decided to proceed in haste to Chattanooga in order to organize his returning men and the city defenses. He sent Garfield to Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas with orders to take command of the forces remaining at Chickamauga and withdraw.

The Union army managed to escape complete disaster because of the stout defense organized by Thomas on Horseshoe Ridge, heroism that earned him the nickname &quot;Rock of Chickamauga.&quot; The army withdrew that night to fortified positions in Chattanooga. Bragg had not succeeded in his objective to destroy the Army of the Cumberland, but the Battle of Chickamauga was nonetheless the worst Union defeat in the Western Theater. Thomas urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted to prop up the morale of his general, telegraphing &quot;Be of good cheer. ... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers. In the main, you must be the judge as to what is to be done. If I was to suggest, I would say save your army by taking strong positions until Burnside joins you.&quot; Privately, Lincoln told John Hay that Rosecrans seemed &quot;confused and stunned like a duck hit on the head.&quot;

Although Rosecrans&#x27;s men were protected by strong defensive positions, the supply lines into Chattanooga were tenuous and subject to Confederate cavalry raids. Bragg&#x27;s army occupied the heights surrounding the city and laid siege upon the Union forces. Rosecrans, demoralized by his defeat, proved unable to break the siege without reinforcements. Only hours after the defeat at Chickamauga, Secretary Stanton ordered Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker to travel to Chattanooga with 15,000 men in two corps from the Army of the Potomac in Virginia. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant was ordered to send 20,000 men under his chief subordinate Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, from Vicksburg, Mississippi. On September 29, Stanton ordered Grant to go to Chattanooga himself, as commander of the newly created Military Division of the Mississippi. Grant was given the option of replacing the demoralized Rosecrans with Thomas. Although Grant did not have good personal relations with either general, he selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland. Grant traveled over the treacherous mountain supply line roads and arrived in Chattanooga on October 23.
Grant executed a plan originally devised by Rosecrans and Brig. Gen. William F. &quot;Baldy&quot; Smith to open the &quot;Cracker Line&quot; and resupply the army and, in a series of battles for Chattanooga (November 23–25, 1863), routed Bragg&#x27;s army and sent it retreating into Georgia.

====Missouri and resignation====
Rosecrans was sent to Cincinnati to await further orders, but ultimately he would play no further large part in the fighting. He was given command of the Department of Missouri from January to December 1864, when he was active in opposing Sterling Price&#x27;s Missouri raid. During the 1864 Republican National Convention, his former chief of staff, James Garfield, head of the Ohio delegation, telegraphed Rosecrans to ask if he would consider running to be Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s vice president. The Republicans that year were seeking a War Democrat to run with Lincoln under the temporary name of &quot;National Union Party.&quot; Rosecrans replied in a cryptically positive manner, but Garfield never received the return telegram. Friends of Rosecrans speculated that Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, intercepted and suppressed it.

Rosecrans was mustered out of the U.S. volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On June 30, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Rosecrans for appointment as a brevet major general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, in gratitude for his actions at Stones River; the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 25, 1866. Rosecrans resigned from the regular army on March 28, 1867. On February 27, 1889, by act of Congress he was re-appointed a brigadier general in the regular army and was placed on the retired list on March 1, 1889.

After the war, Rosecrans became a companion of the District of Columbia Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society of officers who had served in the Union armed forces and their descendants.

==Later life==

After the war, Rosecrans became interested in railroads and was one of the eleven incorporators of the Southern Pacific Railroad, but his valuable interests in the stock of the railroad were lost to some of the unscrupulous financiers who were his business partners. From 1868 to 1869, Rosecrans served as U.S. Minister to Mexico, but was replaced after just five months when his old nemesis, Ulysses Grant, became president. During this brief service, he became convinced that Mexico would benefit from a narrow-gauge railway and telegraph line from Tampico to the coast, but this venture, from 1869 through 1873, was a failure.

Rosecrans then became interested in civil administration and wrote a book, &quot;Popular Government&quot;, with a former newspaperman, Josiah Riley, which advocated registration and voting reforms. He was approached by various political parties to run for high office: Governor of Ohio (Union party, 1866); governor of California (Democratic Party, 1868); governor of Ohio (Democratic Party, 1869); U.S Representative from Nevada (Democratic Party, 1876). He refused all of these offers because they conflicted with potentially promising business ventures, leading him to be referred to by the nickname &quot;The Great Decliner.&quot;

In 1869, Rosecrans bought of Rancho San Pedro in the Los Angeles basin for $2.50 per acre ($620/km2), a low price possibly because the land was deemed worthless for lack of a spring for water. The ranch, dubbed &quot;Rosecrans Rancho&quot;, was bordered by what would later be Florence Avenue on the north, Redondo Beach Boulevard on the south, Central Avenue on the east, and Arlington Avenue on the west. By the time of Rosecrans&#x27;s death, his son Carl was living on the estate, but most of the land had been sold parcel by parcel to support the financial needs of mining ventures in which Rosecrans invested.

In 1880, Rosecrans was elected U.S. Representative as a Democrat from California&#x27;s 1st congressional district. That same year, James Garfield was elected President as a Republican. Rosecrans was distressed to see that Garfield&#x27;s campaign literature played up his role in the war at Rosecrans&#x27;s expense. Their former friendship was irretrievably broken. After Garfield&#x27;s assassination, Charles A. Dana capitalized on the tragedy by publishing the letters written by Garfield after Chickamauga to then-Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase; the letters may have been the major reason for Rosecrans&#x27;s loss of political support at the time.

Rosecrans was reelected in 1882 and became the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, a position in which he publicly opposed a bill that would provide a pension to former President Grant and his wife. Unaware of the serious financial condition of Grant&#x27;s family, Rosecrans objected that some of Grant&#x27;s official statements &quot;were false, and which he knew to be false at the time he made them, and which I have shown in my official reports to be false. I cannot say to the people of this country that a business which has been conducted as to rob poor people of millions, and which, if done on a smaller scale would have sent its managers to prison, shall be considered as important when the principal manager has allowed a great name to be used as the instrument of the robbery.&quot; The bill was passed over his objections. When a bill was introduced in 1889 to restore Rosecrans&#x27;s rank and place him on the retired list, some representatives objected, based on Rosecrans&#x27;s actions against Grant in 1885, but the bill was passed.

Rosecrans did not seek re-election in 1884. He served as a Regent of the University of California in 1884 and 1885.

Although Rosecrans was mentioned on a few occasions as a possible presidential candidate, the first Democratic president elected after the war was Grover Cleveland in 1884. Newspaper stories circulated that Rosecrans was under serious consideration to be appointed his Secretary of War, but he was appointed instead as the Register of the Treasury, serving from 1885 to 1893.

Rosecrans spoke at a grand reunion of Union and Confederate veterans held at the Chickamauga battlefield on September 19, 1889, delivering a moving address praising national reconciliation. The gathering led to Congress establishing the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park the following year, the nation&#x27;s first national battlefield park.

In 1896, he was awarded the Laetare Medal, the oldest and most prestigious award for American Catholics, by the University of Notre Dame.

==Death==
In February 1898, Rosecrans suffered from a cold that turned into pneumonia, but appeared to recover successfully. Then he learned that one of his favorite grandchildren (Rosecrans Toole, the son of Lily and Joseph Kemp Toole, the first Governor of Montana) had died of diphtheria. He was seized with grief and his health failed precipitously. He died on March 11, 1898, at Rancho Sausal Redondo, Redondo Beach, California. His casket lay in state in Los Angeles City Hall, covered by the headquarters flag that flew over Stones River and Chickamauga. In 1908 his remains were interred in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Rosecrans&#x27; reputation has improved somewhat in recent years. Historian Frank Varney presented a case for review in his book &quot;General Grant and the Rewriting of History: How the Destruction of General William S. Rosecrans Influenced Our Understanding of the Civil War&quot;.

Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, in San Diego, California, is named in his honor. Major streets named after William Rosecrans include Rosecrans Avenue, a major east–west street that runs through the southern part of Los Angeles County, and Rosecrans Street in San Diego, which runs near the aforementioned cemetery.

General Rosecrans Elementary School, on Rosecrans and Acacia Avenues in the city of Compton, California, a Los Angeles suburb, bears his name, as does General Rosecrans Elementary in Sunbury, Ohio.

A memorial was constructed on the site of Rosecrans&#x27; birthplace and childhood home. A large boulder surrounded by a wrought iron fence holds a plaque in memoriam and rests beside a rural road that bears his name.

An equestrian statue of Rosecrans, resting on a 55,000 pound black granite boulder, is located on the square surrounding the Town Hall of Sunbury, Ohio. Rosecrans&#x27; Headquarters in the buildup to the Chickamauga Campaign was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The was a troop transport ship used in the early 20th century that saw service in the Pacific. The U.S.A.T. &quot;Rosecrans&quot;, another similarly named ship, was built as Liberty Ship hull 570 by the Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation and rated to hold 504 troops.

<doc id="375984" wikidata="Q57672" url="?curid=375984" title="Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick">
<text>Ernest Augustus (Ernest Augustus Christian George; ; 17 November 1887 – 30 January 1953) was Duke of Brunswick from 2 November 1913 to 8 November 1918. He was a grandson of George V of Hanover, thus a Prince of Hanover and a Prince of the United Kingdom. He was also a maternal grandson of Christian IX of Denmark and the son-in-law of German Emperor Wilhelm II. The Prussians had deposed King George from the Hanoverian throne in 1866, but his marriage ended the decades-long feud between the Prussians and the Hanoverians.

==Early life==

Ernest Augustus was born at Penzing near Vienna, the sixth and youngest child of former Crown Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover and his wife, Princess Thyra of Denmark. His great-grandfather, Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, the fifth son of George III of the United Kingdom, became king of Hanover in 1837 because Salic Law barred Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom, from inheriting the Hanoverian throne.

His father succeeded as pretender to the Hanoverian throne and as Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale in the peerage of Great Britain in 1878. The younger Ernest Augustus became heir apparent to the dukedom of Cumberland and to the Hanoverian claim upon the deaths of his two elder brothers, George and Christian. Through his mother, he was a first cousin of Christian X of Denmark, Haakon VII of Norway, George V of the United Kingdom, Constantine I of Greece and Nicholas II of Russia.

In 1884, his paternal great-granduncle the reigning Duke of Brunswick (a male line descendant of Henry, the older brother of William, his male line ancestor) died. Since the younger branch of the House of Welf ended with him, under house rules it would have passed to the Duke of Cumberland, who immediately claimed the throne. However, the Imperial Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, managed to get the Federal Council (Bundesrat) of the German Empire to rule that the Duke of Cumberland would disturb the peace of the empire if he ascended the throne of Brunswick. Bismarck did this because the duke had never formally renounced his claims to the kingdom of Hanover, which had been annexed to Prussia in 1866 following the end of the Austro-Prussian War (Hanover had sided with losing Austria). Instead, Prince Albrecht of Prussia became the regent of Brunswick. After Prince Albrecht&#x27;s death in 1906, the duke offered that he and his elder son, Prince George, would renounce their claims to the Duchy of Brunswick in order to allow Ernest Augustus, his only other surviving son, to take possession of the Duchy, but this option was rejected by the Bundesrat and the regency continued, this time under Duke Johann Albrecht of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, who had previously acted as regent for his nephew in Mecklenburg.

==Marriage and accession to the duchy of Brunswick==

When Ernest Augustus&#x27;s older brother George died in an automobile accident on 20 May 1912, the German Emperor, Wilhelm II, sent a message of condolence to the Duke of Cumberland. In response to this friendly gesture, the Duke sent his only surviving son, Ernest Augustus, to Berlin to thank the Emperor for his message. Ernest Augustus and Wilhelm II were third cousins through George III of the United Kingdom. In Berlin, Ernest Augustus met and fell in love with the emperor&#x27;s only daughter, Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia.

On 24 May 1913, Ernest Augustus and Victoria Louise, third cousins once removed through descent from George III&#x27;s sons King Ernest Augustus of Hanover and Edward, Duke of Kent, were married to each other. This marriage ended the decades-long rift between the Houses of Hohenzollern and Hanover. The wedding of Prince Ernest Augustus and Princess Victoria Louise was also the last great gathering of European sovereigns before the outbreak of the Great War. In addition to the German Emperor and Empress and the Duke and Duchess of Cumberland, King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom and Tsar Nicholas II attended. Upon the announcement of his betrothal to Princess Victoria Louise in February 1913, Ernest Augustus swore allegiance to the German Empire and accepted a commission as a cavalry captain and company commander in the Zieten–Hussars, a Prussian Army regiment in which his grandfather (George V) and great-grandfather (Ernest Augustus) had been colonels. Two imprisoned British spies, Captain Stewart and Captain Trench, were pardoned and released by the German Emperor as a wedding present to the United Kingdom. George V of the United Kingdom had given consent to the marriage on 17 March 1913, as required by the Royal Marriages Act.

On 27 October 1913, the Duke of Cumberland formally renounced his claims to the duchy of Brunswick in favor of his surviving son. The following day, the Federal Council voted to allow Ernest Augustus to become the reigning Duke of Brunswick. The new Duke of Brunswick formally took possession of his duchy on 1 November. He received a promotion to colonel in the Prussian Zieten Hussars. The new duke and duchess of Brunswick moved into Brunswick Palace in the capital of Brunswick and began their family with the birth of their eldest son, Prince Ernest Augustus, less than a year after their wedding.

During the First World War, Ernest Augustus rose to the rank of major-general.

==Abdication and later life==
In 1917, the British dukedom of Ernest Augustus&#x27;s father, and his own title as a Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, were suspended by the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, which took effect in 1919, as a result of the Duke&#x27;s service in the German army during the war. On 8 November 1918, Ernest Augustus was forced to abdicate his throne, as were all the other German kings, grand dukes, dukes, and princes during the German Revolution of 1918–1919. Thus, when his father died in 1923, Ernest Augustus did not succeed to his father&#x27;s title of Duke of Cumberland. For the next thirty years, Ernest Augustus remained as head of the House of Hanover, living in retirement on his various estates, mainly Blankenburg Castle in Germany and Cumberland Castle in Gmunden, Austria. He also owned Marienburg Castle near Hanover, although rarely ever living there until 1945.
While Ernest Augustus never officially joined the Nazi Party, he donated funds and was close to several leaders. As a former British prince, Ernest Augustus, as well as Victoria Louise, desired a &quot;rapprochement&quot; between the United Kingdom and Germany. Ostensibly desiring to pursue an alliance with the UK, in the mid-1930s, Adolf Hitler took advantage of their sentiment by asking the couple to arrange a match between their daughter Princess Frederica and the Prince of Wales. The Duke and Duchess of Brunswick refused, believing that the age difference was too great. After his abdication in 1936, Edward VIII and his wife visited &quot;the Cumberlands&quot; at Cumberland Castle in Gmunden, Austria. In 1938 Princess Frederica married Prince Paul of Greece, brother and heir-presumptive of King George II of Greece.

By the time the Second World War ended in Europe in April 1945, he and his family were staying at Blankenburg. A few days before Blankenburg was handed over to the Red Army by British and U.S. forces in late 1945, to become part of East Germany, the family was able to move to Marienburg Castle, at the time located in the British Occupation Zone, with all their furniture, transported by British Army trucks, on the order of .
Ernest Augustus lived to see his daughter Frederica become a queen consort in 1947 when her husband Paul became King of the Hellenes. Ernest Augustus died at Marienburg Castle in 1953. He was interred, later to be joined by the remains of his wife, in front of the Royal Mausoleum in the Berggarten at Herrenhausen Gardens in Hanover, which is the burial chapel of King Ernest Augustus of Hanover and his wife.

<doc id="375986" wikidata="Q131541" url="?curid=375986" title="States and union territories of India">
<text>India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories, for a total of 36 entities. The states and union territories are further subdivided into 800 districts and smaller administrative divisions.

The states of India are self-governing administrative divisions, each having a state government. The governing powers of the states are shared between the state government and the union government. On the other hand, the union territories are directly governed by the union government.

== History ==
=== 1876–1919 ===

The Indian Empire was a very complex political entity consisting of various imperial divisions and states and territories of varying autonomy. At the time of its establishment in 1876, it was made up of 584 constituent states and the directly ruled territories of the Crown. The entire empire was divided into provinces and agencies. 

A province consisted of territory under the direct rule of the Emperor of India (who was also the King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions) and a few minor states, ruled by Indian princes under the suzerainty of the Emperor. A Governor or Lieutenant-Governor acted as the representative of the Emperor to that province and head of government of the directly ruled territories in the province. 

The governor or lieutenant-governor also served as the Emperor&#x27;s representative to the constituent states of the province. The first three of the lieutenant-governorships were territories annexed to India from other powers and temporarily governed by the erstwhile Bengal Presidency, before being made into their own separate provinces. Agra and Bengal were still considered &quot;de jure&quot; parts of the defunct Bengal Presidency for judicial and legal purposes. Agra was separated in 1878 and merged with Oudh. 

The Bengal Presidency was re-established in 1912 as a governorship. All these provinces had their own legislatures established by the Indian Councils Acts, and high courts established by Indian High Courts Acts. Laws passed by these legislatures needed the dual assent of the governor or lieutenant-governor of the province and the governor-general of India, who functioned as the representative of the Emperor. 
*There were three governor&#x27;s provinces in 1912, styled &quot;Presidencies&quot; as a historical memento that they had been once governed by presidents. These were:
**Bombay
**Madras (officially Presidency of Fort St. George)
**Bengal (from 1912)
*There were six lieutenant-governor&#x27;s provinces in 1905. These were: 
**Burma 
**Punjab
**Central Provinces 
**Bengal (till 1912)
**Eastern Bengal and Assam (1905–1912)
**Agra and Oudh
***North-Western Provinces and Oudh (1878–1902)
***United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (1902–1935)

In addition to these, there were certain territories ruled directly by the Government of India through nominated chief commissioners. These were former independent states annexed to India and since ruled directly by the Supreme Government.
*There were the three chief commissioner&#x27;s provinces. These did not have a legislature or a high court. These were: 
**Ajmer-Merwara
**Coorg 
**Oudh (till 1878)
**Delhi (from 1911, capital of India)

A vast majority of the Indian states in the late nineteenth century were, in terms of imperial divisions, organised within the provinces. However a good number of states were organised into imperial structures called agencies, or residencies. An Agent to the Governor-General (AGG) functioned as the Emperor&#x27;s representative to all the states in the agency. 
*At the time of establishment of the empire, there were only two agencies:
**Rajputana
**Central India
*In addition, these kingdoms were neither part of a province or an agency and had direct relations with the Emperor:
**Kashmir and Jammu
**Nizamate of Hyderabad
**Kingdom of Mysore

=== 1919–1935 ===
In 1919, the fourth Government of India was enacted by the Crown. This saw many major changes. The legislatures of the provinces were made elected ones rather than nominated ones. Some provinces were given bicameral legislatures. All provinces were elevated to governorships and all lieutenant governors were made governors. Burma was given a special status and made an autonomous province.
*There were ten governor&#x27;s provinces now. These were:
**Bombay
**Madras
**Bengal
**Burma 
**Punjab
**Central Provinces and Berar
**United Provinces
**North-West Frontier Province
**Assam
**Bihar and Orissa
*There were four chief commissioner&#x27;s provinces. Their status mostly remained unchanged. These were:
**Ajmer-Merwara
**Coorg 
**Balochistan
**Delhi
The Chamber of Princes was established by Emperor George V in 1920. One of the major consequences of this was the creation of many more agencies from the states of the provinces, thus granting them direct relations with the Emperor instead of with the Governors. 
*There were now 8 imperial agencies and residencies. These were:
**Punjab States (formerly part of Punjab Province)
**Madras States (formerly part of Madras Presidency)
**Deccan States Agency and Kolhapur Residency (formerly part of Bombay Presidency)
**Western India and Gujarat States Agency and Baroda Residency (formerly part of Bombay Presidency)
**Eastern States (formerly part of Bengal Presidency, Bihar and Orissa Province and Central Provinces)
**Gwalior Residency (formerly part of Central India Agency)
**Rajputana
**Central India
This saw the separation of all the states from the provinces and addition to before-mentioned agencies. This left all the provinces with only territories under direct Crown rule. 
*Some states were with direct relations with the Emperor. These were:
**Kashmir and Jammu
**Nizamate of Hyderabad
**Kingdom of Mysore

=== 1935–1947 ===
The latter years of the Indian Empire saw the enactment of the last Government of India Act by the Crown. This act granted full autonomy to Indian provinces. Provincial laws no longer needed the assent of the governor-general. This act created the office of a Premier in each province, who functioned as the new head of government and was responsible to the provincial legislature. 

Bengal, Madras and Bombay which had been till now styled Presidencies, were now officially styled as provinces. The provinces of Orissa and Sind were created from Bihar and Bombay respectively. The Province of Burma which had previously functioned as an autonomous province of India was now separated from the Indian Empire, and established as the Crown Colony of Burma.

*The new set of 12 governor&#x27;s provinces were:
**Bombay
**Sind
**Madras
**Bengal
**Burma 
**Punjab
**Central Provinces and Berar
**United Provinces
**North-West Frontier Province
**Assam
**Bihar
**Orissa
*There were 4 chief commissioner&#x27;s provinces:
**Ajmer-Merwara
**Coorg 
**Balochistan
**Delhi
*There were 8 imperial agencies and residencies:
**Punjab States
**Madras States
**Deccan States Agency and Kolhapur Residency
**Western India and Gujarat States Agency and Baroda Residency
**Eastern States
**Gwalior Residency
**Rajputana
**Central India
*Three kingdoms were in direct relations with the Emperor.
In 1947, the last Act of the Crown was passed. The act dissolved the Indian Empire, the Imperial Legislative Council and the Chamber of Princes. The Union of India was consequently established from 9 former Indian provinces (East Punjab, United Provinces, Central Provinces, Madras, Bombay, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and Assam) and 562 former Indian states.

=== 1947–1950 ===

Between 1947 and 1950, the territories of the princely states were politically integrated into the new Indian Union. Most were merged into existing provinces. Others were organised into new provinces and states, such as Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Malwa Union, Baghelkhand and Bundelkhand States Union, and Patiala and East Punjab States Union, made up of multiple princely states. A few, including Mysore, Hyderabad, Bhopal, and Bilaspur, became separate states.

The new Constitution of India, which came into force on 26 January 1950, made India a sovereign democratic republic. The new republic was also declared to be a &quot;Union of States&quot;. The constitution of 1950 distinguished between three main types of states:

* Part A states, which were the former governors&#x27; provinces of India, were ruled by an elected governor and state legislature. The nine Part A states were:
** Assam (formerly Assam Province), 
** Bihar (formerly Bihar Province), 
** Bombay (formerly Bombay Province), 
** East Punjab (formerly Punjab Province), 
** Madhya Pradesh (formerly the Central Provinces and Berar), 
** Madras (formerly Madras Province), 
** Orissa (formerly Orissa Province), 
** Uttar Pradesh (formerly the United Provinces), and
** West Bengal (formerly Bengal Province).
* The eight Part B states were former princely states or groups of princely states, governed by a rajpramukh, who was usually the ruler of a constituent state, and an elected legislature. The rajpramukh was appointed by the President of India. The Part B states were:
** Hyderabad (formerly Hyderabad Princely State), 
** Jammu and Kashmir (formerly Jammu and Kashmir Princely State), 
** Madhya Bharat (formerly Central India Agency), 
** Mysore (formerly Mysore Princely State), 
** Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU),
** Rajasthan (formerly Rajputana Agency),
** Saurashtra (formerly Baroda, Western India and Gujarat States Agency), and 
** Travancore–Cochin (formerly Travancore Princely State and Cochin Princely State).
* The ten Part C states included both the former chief commissioners&#x27; provinces and some princely states, and each was governed by a chief commissioner appointed by the President of India. The Part C states were: 
** Ajmer (formerly Ajmer-Merwara Province), 
** Bhopal (formerly Bhopal Princely State),
**Bilaspur (formerly Bilaspur Princely State),
** Coorg State (formerly Coorg Province), 
** Delhi, 
** Himachal Pradesh, 
** Kutch (formerly Cutch Princely State), 
** Manipur (formerly Manipur Princely State), 
** Tripura (formerly Tripura Princely State), and 
** Vindhya Pradesh (formerly Central India Agency).
* The only Part D state was the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which were administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the union government.

=== States reorganisation (1951–1956) ===

Andhra State was created on 1 October 1953 from the Telugu-speaking northern districts of Madras State.

The French enclave of Chandernagore was transferred to West Bengal in 1954. In the same year Pondicherry, comprising the former French enclaves of Pondichéry, Karikal, Yanaon and Mahé, was transferred to India. This became a union territory in 1962.

Also in 1954, pro-India forces liberated the Portuguese-held enclaves of Dadrá and Nagar Aveli, declaring the short-lived &quot;de facto&quot; state of Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli. In 1961, India annexed it as the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

The States Reorganisation Act, 1956 reorganised the states based on linguistic lines resulting in the creation of the new states.

As a result of this act:
* Madras State retained its name, with Kanyakumari district added to form Travancore–Cochin. 
* Andhra Pradesh was created with the merger of Andhra State with the Telugu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in 1956. 
* Kerala was created by merging Malabar district and the Kasaragod taluk of South Canara districts of Madras State with Travancore–Cochin. 
* Mysore State was re-organised with the addition of the districts of Bellary and South Canara (excluding Kasaragod taluk) and the Kollegal taluk of Coimbatore district from the Madras State, the districts of Belgaum, Bijapur, North Canara and Dharwad from Bombay State, the Kannada-majority districts of Bidar, Raichur and Kalaburagi from Hyderabad State and the Coorg State. 
* The Laccadive Islands, Aminidivi Islands and Minicoy Island, which had been divided between the South Canara and Malabar districts of Madras State, were united and organised into the union territory of Lakshadweep.
* Bombay State was enlarged by the addition of Saurashtra State and Kutch State, the Marathi-speaking districts of Nagpur division of Madhya Pradesh and the Marathwada region of Hyderabad State. 
* Rajasthan and Punjab gained territories from Ajmer State and Patiala and East Punjab States Union respectively and certain territories of Bihar were transferred to West Bengal.

=== Post-1956 ===

Bombay State was split into the linguistic states of Gujarat and Maharashtra on 1 May 1960 by the Bombay Reorganisation Act. The former Union Territory of Nagaland achieved statehood on 1 December 1963. The Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 resulted in the creation of Haryana on 1 November and the transfer of the northern districts of Punjab to Himachal Pradesh. The act designated Chandigarh as a union territory and the shared capital of Punjab and Haryana.

Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu in 1969. The north-eastern states of Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura were formed on 21 January 1972. Mysore State was renamed Karnataka in 1973. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union and the state&#x27;s monarchy was abolished. In 1987, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram became states on 20 February, followed by Goa on 30 May, while erstwhile union territory of Goa, Daman and Diu&#x27;s northern exclaves Damão and Diu became a separate union territory as Daman and Diu.

In November 2000, three new states were created, namely: 
* Chhattisgarh, from eastern Madhya Pradesh, 
* Uttaranchal, from northwest Uttar Pradesh (renamed Uttarakhand in 2007), and
* Jharkhand, from southern districts of Bihar with the enforcement of Madhya Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000, Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000 and Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000 respectively.

Pondicherry was renamed Puducherry in 2007 and Orissa was renamed Odisha in 2011. Telangana was created on 2 June 2014 from ten former districts of north-western Andhra Pradesh.

In August 2019, the Parliament of India passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, which contains provisions to reorganise the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories; Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, effective from 31 October 2019. Later that year in November, the Government of India introduced legislation to merge the union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli into a single union territory to be known as Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, effective from 26 January 2020.

<text>Constance Elaine Trimmer Willis (born December 31, 1945), commonly known as Connie Willis, is an American science fiction and fantasy writer. She has won eleven Hugo Awards and seven Nebula Awards for particular works—more major SF awards than any other writer—most recently the &quot;Best Novel&quot; Hugo and Nebula Awards for &quot;Blackout/All Clear&quot; (2010). She was inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2009 and the Science Fiction Writers of America named her its 28th SFWA Grand Master in 2011.

Several of her works feature time travel by history students at the future University of Oxford, called the Time Travel series or the Oxford Time Travel Series. They are the short story &quot;Fire Watch&quot; (1982, also in several anthologies and the 1985 collection of the same name), the novels &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; and &quot;To Say Nothing of the Dog&quot; (1992 and 1997), and the two-part novel &quot;Blackout/All Clear&quot; (2010). All four won the annual Hugo Award, and &quot;Doomsday Book&quot; and &quot;Blackout/All Clear&quot; won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, making her the first author to win Hugo awards for all books in a series.

==Personal life==
Willis is a 1967 graduate of Colorado State College, now the University of Northern Colorado, where she completed degrees in English and Elementary Education. She lives in Greeley, Colorado, with her husband Courtney Willis, a former professor of physics at the University of Northern Colorado. They have one daughter, Cordelia.

In a 1996 interview Willis said, &quot;I sing soprano in a Congregationalist church choir. It is my belief that everything you need to know about the world can be learned in a church choir.&quot;

==Career==

Willis&#x27;s first published story was &quot;The Secret of Santa Titicaca&quot; in &quot;Worlds of Fantasy&quot;, Winter 1970 (December). At least seven stories followed (1978–81) before her debut novel, &quot;Water Witch&quot; by Willis and Cynthia Felice, published by Ace Books in 1982. After receiving a National Endowment for the Arts grant that year, she left her teaching job and became a full-time writer.

Scholar Gary K. Wolfe has written, &quot;Willis, the erstwhile stand-up superstar of SF conventions—having her as your MC is like getting Billy Crystal back as host of the Oscars—and the author of some of the field&#x27;s funniest stories, is a woman of considerably greater complexity and gravity than her personal popularity reflects, and for all her facility at screwball comedy knock-offs and snappy parody, she wants us to know that she&#x27;s a writer of some gravity as well.&quot;

Willis is known for writing &quot;romantic &#x27;screwball&#x27; comedy in the manner of 1940s Hollywood movies.&quot;

Much of Willis&#x27;s writing explores the social sciences. She often weaves technology into her stories in order to prompt readers to question what impact it has on the world. For instance, &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Dreams&quot; plumbs not just the psychology of dreams, but also their role as indicators of disease. The story portrays a young man&#x27;s unrequited love for a young woman who might or might not be experiencing reincarnation or precognition, and whose outlook verges on suicidal. Similarly, &quot;Bellwether&quot; is almost exclusively concerned with human psychology.

===2006 Hugo Awards ceremony controversy===
At the 2006 Hugo Awards ceremony, Willis presented writer Harlan Ellison with a special committee award. When Ellison got to the podium, Willis asked him &quot;Are you going to be good?&quot; When she asked the question a second time, Ellison put the microphone in his mouth, to the crowd&#x27;s laughter. He then momentarily put his hand on her left breast. Ellison subsequently complained that Willis refused to acknowledge his apology.

<text>Humboldt Redwoods State Park is a state park of California, United States, containing Rockefeller Forest, the world&#x27;s largest remaining contiguous old-growth forest of coast redwoods. It is located south of Eureka, California, near Weott in southern Humboldt County, within Northern California, named after the great German nineteenth-century scientist, Alexander von Humboldt. The park was established by the Save the Redwoods League in 1921 largely from lands purchased from the Pacific Lumber Company. Beginning with the dedication of the Raynal Bolling Memorial Grove, it has grown to become the third-largest park in the California State Park system, now containing through acquisitions and gifts to the state.

It is part of the Northern California coastal forests ecoregion and has of old-growth forests. are old-growth redwoods, comprising the entire Bull Creek watershed and the Rockefeller Forest. Only 5% of old coastal redwood forests remain.

Nearby U.S. Route 101, which generally follows the Eel River and its South Fork in this part of the North Coast, offers easy access to the park and nearby towns with connections to the scenic highway, Avenue of the Giants, also mostly located within or near park boundaries.

==History==

The original inhabitants of the area were the Sinkyone. In the 1850s white settlers began felling the redwoods, seeking to clear the land for homes and pasture. About 20 years later the timber industry moved into the region, and railways and roads were routed through the area for accessibility to the trees. In 1918 after realizing how much of the old-growth forests closer to San Francisco had been harvested, Boone and Crockett Club members formed the Save the Redwoods League, and began working to preserve redwood forests in the region, including the area that became Humboldt Redwoods State Park. The Garden Club of America, through its Redwood Grove Committee, raised half of the funds needed to buy the 2,552 acre Canoe Creek Grove which became part of Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Sarah Gildersleeve Fife was instrumental in the activities of this committee.

== Redwoods ==
Many of the coast redwoods (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) grow to over in height. The forests on alluvial plains are almost pure redwood forest, but the forests on the slopes also contain Douglas-fir.

Over 100 of the 137 known trees over tall—all coast redwoods—occur in Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It is home to the 4th-tallest measured living redwood, the Stratosphere Giant, which was measured at in 2004. Stratosphere Giant was the tallest known living redwood until the discovery of three taller trees in Redwood National Park; the tallest, Hyperion, measuring in September 2006.

Before the discovery of Hyperion, the tallest redwood ever measured was the Dyerville Giant, also in Humboldt Redwoods State Park. It was high when it fell in March 1991. It was estimated to be 1,600 years old. The Dyerville Giant can be seen on Founders Grove Nature Trail, which honors the creators of Save the Redwoods League. Also in this grove is Founders Tree, which is tall with circumference of . There is also an albino redwood referred to as the Christmas Tree. 

== Wildlife ==

<text>Russell Conwell Hoban (February 4, 1925 – December 13, 2011) was an American writer. His works span many genres, including fantasy, science fiction, mainstream fiction, magical realism, poetry, and children&#x27;s books.
He lived in London from 1969 until his death.

==Biography==
Hoban was born in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, just outside Philadelphia, to Jewish immigrants from Ostrog (now in Ukraine). His father, Abram T. Hoban, was the advertising manager of the Yiddish-language &quot;Jewish Daily Forward&quot; and the director of The Drama Guild of the Labor Institute of the Workmen&#x27;s Circle of Philadelphia. His father died when Russell was 11, and Russell was thereafter raised by his mother, Jeanette Dimmerman. He was named for Russell Conwell. After briefly attending Temple University, he enlisted in the Army at age 18 and served in the Philippines and Italy as a radio operator during World War II, earning a bronze star. During his military service he married Lillian Aberman, who later became a writer and illustrator herself. They had four children before divorcing in 1975.

After leaving military service, Hoban worked as an illustrator, painting several covers for &quot;TIME&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and as an advertising copywriter—occupations which several of his characters later shared—before he wrote and illustrated his first children&#x27;s book, &quot;What Does It Do and How Does It Work?: Power Shovel, Dump Truck, and Other Heavy Machines&quot;, published by Harper in 1959. His 1962 &quot;Time&quot; cover portrait of Joan Baez now hangs in the US National Portrait Gallery. 

The note &quot;About the Artist&quot; in the Macmillan Classics Edition of &quot;Tales and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; (second printing 1965), which Hoban illustrated, notes that he worked in advertising for Batten Barton Durstine &amp; Osborn and that he later became the art director of J. Walter Thompson: &quot;Heavy machinery later became subjects for his paintings, and this led him into the children&#x27;s book field with the writing and illustrating of &quot;What Does It Do and How Does It Work?&quot; and &quot;The Atomic Submarine&quot;.&quot; That note also points out that in 1964, at the time the book&#x27;s illustrations were copyrighted, Hoban was teaching drawing at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, collaborating with his first wife on their fifth children&#x27;s book, and living in Connecticut.

Hoban wrote exclusively for children for the next decade, and came to be known best for the series of seven picture books that feature Frances, a temperamental badger girl whose escapades were based partly on the experiences of his four children, Phoebe, Brom, Esmé and Julia, and their friends.

&lt;poem&gt;
Frances did not eat her egg.
She sang a little song to it.
She sang the song very softly:

&quot;I do not like the way you slide,
I do not like your soft inside,
I do not like you lots of ways,
And I could do for many days
Without eggs.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Garth Williams depicted Frances as a badger in the first book, &quot;Bedtime for Frances&quot; (Harper, 1960), and Lillian Hoban retained that image as the illustrator of five sequels and a poetry collection, published from 1964 to 1972.

The U.S. national library reports holding about three dozen books written by Hoban and published from 1959 to 1972, including about two dozen illustrated by Lillian Hoban. One was illustrated by their son Brom Hoban: &quot;The Sea-thing Child&quot; (1972).

A dark philosophical tale for older children, &quot;The Mouse and His Child&quot;, appeared in 1967 and was Hoban&#x27;s first full-length novel. It was later made into an animated film in 1977 by Murakami-Wolf-Swenson.

In 1969, the Hobans and their children travelled to London, intending to stay only a short time. The marriage dissolved and, while the rest of the family returned to the United States, Hoban remained in London for the rest of his life. All of Hoban&#x27;s adult novels except for &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;, &quot;Pilgermann&quot;, &quot;Angelica Lost and Found&quot; (October 2010) and &quot;Fremder&quot; are set either wholly or partly in contemporary London.

In 1971, Hoban wrote a book employing concepts borrowed from &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;, called &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot;, which further reached fans through a 1977 television special originally created for HBO by the Jim Henson Company. The book was illustrated by Lillian Hoban, whose drawn renditions of these characters were faithfully replicated by the Muppet creators. The story tells of a poor otter mother and son who do what they must to try to provide a special Christmas to one another, taking a route neither of them expected. His novel &quot;Turtle Diary&quot; (1975) was turned into a film version released in 1985, with a screenplay by Harold Pinter.

==Family==
Hoban had four children with his first wife, Lillian Aberman Hoban. Their daughter Phoebe Hoban is a journalist and biographer who specializes in art. The couple divorced in 1975, and in the same year he married Gundula Ahl, who worked in the fashionable London bookshop Truslove and Hanson. With Ahl he had three children, one of whom is the composer Wieland Hoban, to whom &quot;Riddley Walker&quot; is dedicated. Wieland Hoban set one of his father&#x27;s texts to music in his piece &quot;Night Roads&quot; (1998–99).

Hoban&#x27;s sister, Tana Hoban (1917–2006), was a photographer and children&#x27;s author; he also had another sister, Freeda Hoban Ellis (1919–2002).

==Later life==

The last of Hoban&#x27;s novels published during his lifetime was &quot;Angelica Lost and Found&quot; (October 2010), in which the hippogriff from Girolamo da Carpi&#x27;s &quot;Ruggiero Saving Angelica&quot; breaks free from the 16th-century painting to search for Angelica in 21st-century San Francisco.

Hoban died on 13 December 2011. He had once ruefully observed that death would be a good career move: &quot;People will say, &#x27;Yes, Hoban, he seems an interesting writer, let&#x27;s look at him again&#x27;.&quot;

Two new Hoban books were published posthumously by Walker Books in 2012: &quot;Soonchild&quot;, illustrated by Alexis Deacon, and &quot;Rosie&#x27;s Magic Horse&quot;, illustrated by Quentin Blake. Deacon also provided artwork for a new version of &quot;Jim&#x27;s Lion&quot;, published in 2014, which changed the format from a traditional picture book to a combination of text chapters and comics.

After his death, Hoban&#x27;s papers were archived by writer Paul Cooper, and in 2016 the archive was acquired by the Beinecke Library at Yale University.

==Fan and community activity==

In May 1998, Dave Awl, a writer/performer with the experimental Chicago theatre troupe the Neo-Futurists, launched the first comprehensive Russell Hoban reference website, The Head of Orpheus, to which Russell Hoban regularly contributed news and information up until his death. In the fall of 1999, Awl founded a Hoban-themed online community called The Kraken (named after one of the characters in Hoban&#x27;s 1987 novel The Medusa Frequency), which grew into an international network of Russell Hoban fans.

In 2002 an annual fan activity dubbed the Slickman A4 Quotation Event (SA4QE) (named after its founder, Diana Slickman, also a member of the Neo-Futurists) began, in which Hoban enthusiasts celebrate his birthday by writing down favourite quotes from his books (invariably on sheets of yellow A4 paper, a recurring Hoban motif) and leaving them in public places.
By 2004, the event had occurred three times; as of February 2011 it has since taken place each year, seeing over 350 quotes distributed around 46 towns and cities throughout 14 countries.

In 2005 fans from across the world celebrated Hoban&#x27;s work in London at the first international convention for the author, &quot;The Russell Hoban Some-Poasyum&quot; (a pun on symposium from &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;). A booklet was published by the organisers to commemorate the event featuring tributes to Hoban from a variety of contributors including actor and politician Glenda Jackson, novelist David Mitchell, composer Harrison Birtwistle and screenwriter Andrew Davies.

In 2012 a new &quot;official&quot; Russell Hoban website, www.russellhoban.org, was built and launched by volunteers from the community, with the approval of the author&#x27;s family.

==Stage adaptations==

In 1984, Hoban collaborated with the Impact Theatre Co-operative on a performance entitled &quot;The Carrier Frequency&quot;. Hoban supplied the text for the piece, which was staged and performed by Impact. In 1999, &quot;The Carrier Frequency&quot; was restaged by the theater company Stan&#x27;s Cafe.

In February 1986, a theatrical version of Hoban&#x27;s novel &quot;Riddley Walker&quot; (adapted by Hoban himself) premiered at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester. Its US premiere was at the Chocolate Bayou Theatre, in April 1987, directed by Greg Roach.

In November 2007, Hoban&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Riddley Walker&quot; was produced (for the third time) by the Red Kettle Theatre Company, in Waterford, Ireland, and was reviewed favorably in the &quot;Irish Times&quot;.

In March 1989 a stage adaptation of &quot;Kleinzeit&quot; was presented by the Tower Theatre Company, directed by Peta Barker, who had adapted the novel. One performance was seen by Russell Hoban who wrote a critique of the play, written on yellow paper, which is a major theme of the novel.

In 2011, the Trouble Puppet Theater Company produced an adaptation of &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;, with permission from and the aid of Russell Hoban. Artistic Director Connor Hopkins created the puppet theater play, with performances September 29 through October 16, 2011, at Salvage Vanguard Theater in Austin, Texas, U.S. The production employed tabletop puppetry inspired by the Bunraku tradition and enjoyed popular and critical success.

In 2012, the Royal Shakespeare Company announced that it would be premiering a new staging of Hoban&#x27;s novel &quot;The Mouse and His Child&quot; as part of its winter 2012–13 season.

==Themes==

Hoban is often described as a fantasy writer, and only two of his novels, &quot;Turtle Diary&quot; and &quot;The Bat Tattoo&quot;, are entirely devoid of supernatural elements. However, the fantasy elements are usually presented as only moderately surprising developments in an otherwise realistic contemporary story, which is magic realism. Exceptions include &quot;Kleinzeit&quot;, a comic fantasy whose characters include Death, Hospital, and Underground; &quot;Riddley Walker&quot;, a science-fiction novel whose futuristic setting is primitive and post-apocalyptic; &quot;Pilgermann&quot;, a historical novel about the Crusades; and &quot;Fremder&quot;, a more conventional science-fiction novel. 

There is frequent repetition of images and themes in different contexts. For instance, many of Hoban&#x27;s works refer to lions, Orpheus, Eurydice, Persephone, Vermeer, severed heads, heart disease, flickering, Odilon Redon, and King Kong.

==Awards==

&quot;How Tom Beat Captain Najork and His Hired Sportsmen&quot; (1974), a picture book written by Hoban, illustrated by Quentin Blake, and published by Jonathan Cape, shared the annual Whitbread Award for Children&#x27;s Books.

&quot;Riddley Walker&quot;, a novel published by Cape in 1980, won the 1982 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, juried recognition of the year&#x27;s best SF novel published in English, and the &quot;Best International Novel&quot; prize at the 1983 Australian SF Convention (Ditmar Award). &quot;Pilgermann&quot; was one finalist a year later when no best international novel was named.

<text>The Am486 is a 80486-class family of computer processors that was produced by AMD in the 1990s. Intel beat AMD to market by nearly four years, but AMD priced its 40 MHz 486 at or below Intel&#x27;s price for a 33 MHz chip, offering about 20% better performance for the same price.

While competing 486 chips, such as those from Cyrix, benchmarked lower than the equivalent Intel chip, AMD&#x27;s 486 matched Intel&#x27;s performance on a clock-for-clock basis.

While the Am386 was primarily used by small computer manufacturers, the Am486DX, DX2, and SX2 chips gained acceptance among larger computer manufacturers, especially Acer and Compaq, in the 1994 time frame.

AMD&#x27;s higher clocked 486 chips provided superior integer performance to many of the early Pentium chips, especially the 60 and 66 MHz launch products. While equivalent Intel 80486DX4 chips were priced high and required a minor socket modification, AMD priced low. Intel&#x27;s DX4 chips initially had twice the cache of the AMD chips, giving them a slight performance edge, but AMD&#x27;s DX4-100 usually cost less than Intel&#x27;s DX2-66.

The enhanced Am486 series supported new features like extended power-saving modes and an 8 KiB Write-Back L1-Cache, later versions even got an upgrade to 16 KiB Write-Back L1-Cache.

The 133 MHz AMD Am5x86 was a higher clocked enhanced Am486.

One derivative of the Am486 family is the core used in the AMD Élan SC4xx family of microcontrollers marketed by AMD.

<text>Anthony Charles Edwards (born July 19, 1962) is an American actor, director, and producer. He played Dr. Mark Greene on the first eight seasons of &quot;ER&quot;, for which he received a Golden Globe Award and six Screen Actors Guild Awards, and was nominated for four consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards. He has appeared in various films and television series, including &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, &quot;Gotcha!&quot;, &quot;Miracle Mile&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot;, &quot;Planes&quot;, &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, and &quot;Designated Survivor&quot;.

==Early life==
Edwards was born in Santa Barbara, California, the son of Erika Kem Edwards Plack (née Weber), an artist/landscape painter, and Peter Edwards, an architect to whom he was one of five children. His maternal grandfather was designer Kem Weber. He is partly of German and Irish descent. He received a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in England and studied theatre at the University of Southern California.

==Career==
===Television and film===

Edward&#x27;s early film appearances included roles in &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; (1984), &quot;Gotcha!&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; (1985). It was Edwards&#x27;s role as LTJG Nick &quot;Goose&quot; Bradshaw alongside Tom Cruise in the 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot; that brought his first widespread public acknowledgement. His character, who died in an aviation accident, was among the most prominent and popular in the film. Scenes with him and his film family (played by Meg Ryan and Aaron and Adam Weis) were later reprised as flashbacks in the 2022 sequel &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;.

Edwards&#x27;s roles following &quot;Top Gun&quot; included &quot;Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise&quot; (1987), &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; (1988), &quot;Downtown&quot; (1990), &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Client&quot; (1994). He also had a recurring role on the TV series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; from 1992 to 1993.

His best-known role is as Dr. Mark Greene on the long-running TV series &quot;ER&quot;, from the series premiere in 1994 to the end of the eighth season in 2002. The series also afforded Edwards his first opportunity to direct. Edwards&#x27;s desire to pursue directing led to his request to be written out of the series. He reportedly earned $35 million for three seasons on &quot;ER&quot;, which made him one of television&#x27;s highest-paid actors. Edwards received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for &quot;ER&quot;. He won a Golden Globe Award For Best Performance by an Actor-In a TV Series after being nominated four times and he has two Screen Actor&#x27;s Guild Awards. In 2008, Edwards returned to &quot;ER&quot; to reprise his role as Dr. Greene (in flashback scenes, where he treats the dying son of character Catherine Banfield) for one episode during its 15th and final season. Following ER, he took some time to raise his children, appreciating the privilege that his &quot;ER&quot; salary provided.

His film appearances following ER included the science fiction film &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (2004), the psychological thriller film &quot;The Forgotten&quot; (2004) and the crime thriller film &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007). In 2010, Edwards appeared in the movie &quot;Motherhood&quot;, which set a record for the biggest bomb in British cinema history by garnering £88 on 11 tickets on opening weekend. &quot;Motherhood&quot; did not fare much better in the United States, earning $93,388 in three weeks of release. At the time, he said he took the role because &quot;it seemed like a very organic and real thing. It really kind of reminded me of what the dynamic in a family is like.&quot; Edwards reunited with Val Kilmer, another actor from &quot;Top Gun&quot;, when he voiced one of the fighter jets in the Disneytoon Studios film &quot;Planes&quot; (2013).

In 2018, Edwards was cast in the recurring role in the third season of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Designated Survivor&quot; as Mars Harper, the President&#x27;s Chief of Staff. In 2020, he served as an executive producer of the film adaptation of Martin Moran&#x27;s &quot;The Tricky Part&quot;. In 2022, Edwards was cast as Alan Reed in Netflix&#x27;s docu-series &quot;Inventing Anna&quot;.

===Honors and awards===
Edwards received four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for &quot;ER&quot; and won as an executive producer on Outstanding Television Movie winner &quot;Temple Grandin&quot;. He earned a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Series (1995); and won six Screen Actors Guild Awards for: Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series (1996 and 1998), and Best Ensemble Cast (1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999). He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Drama in 1998).

===Theater===

After a long career in television, Edwards made his Broadway debut as his &quot;second act&quot; in 2018 in the revival of &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; at Studio 54. In 2015 he appeared in Classic Stage Company&#x27;s &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; but his stage acting career began when he was growing up in Santa Barbara.

On May 13, 2022, Edwards made his unexpected Broadway musical debut when he appeared as Dr. Walker in the Broadway production of &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; due to COVID-19 cases impacting the cast. The show also stars his wife, Mare Winningham.

Edwards appeared in the 2024 Broadway production of &quot;Prayer for the French Republic&quot; by Joshua Harmon.

==Personal life==
Edwards was married to Jeanine Lobell from 1994 to 2015. They have one son and three daughters. At the end of 2021, Edwards and longtime friend and fellow actor Mare Winningham eloped.

On November 10, 2017, Edwards wrote an essay on &quot;Medium&quot;, in which he stated that producer and screenwriter Gary Goddard had befriended and for years sexually assaulted him and his friends, beginning when they were 12 years old.

Edwards has been a licensed private pilot since 2012.

<doc id="376011" wikidata="Q692665" url="?curid=376011" title="Muratorian fragment">
<text>The Muratorian fragment, also known as the Muratorian Canon (Latin: ), is a copy of perhaps the oldest known list of most of the books of the New Testament. The fragment, consisting of 85 lines, is a Latin manuscript bound in a roughly 8th-century codex from the library of Columbanus&#x27;s monastery at Bobbio Abbey; it contains features suggesting it is a translation from a Greek original written in the late 2nd century (). Other scholars suggest it might have been originally written as late as the 4th century, although this is not the consensus opinion. Both the degraded condition of the manuscript and the poor Latin in which it was written have made it difficult to translate. The beginning of the fragment is missing, and it ends abruptly. The fragment consists of all that remains of a section of a list of all the works that were accepted as canonical by the churches known to its original compiler. 

During the time period of early Christianity, there was no accepted &quot;New Testament&quot;, merely books considered of greater or lesser value. While likely not intended strictly as a canon list, the fragment is evidence of the first attempts to systemize such a group of approved writings, at least if it indeed dates to the 2nd century. Debates on what works should be accepted as scripture would continue. The earliest version of the eventual consensus New Testament canon did not occur until 367, when bishop Athanasius of Alexandria in his annual Easter letter composed a list that is still recognized today as the canon of 27 books. However, it would take several more centuries of debate until agreement on Athanasius&#x27; canon was reached within all of Christendom.

==Manuscript history==
The Muratorian fragment was discovered in the Ambrosian Library in Milan by Father Ludovico Antonio Muratori (1672–1750), the most famous Italian historian of his generation. Realizing its significance and antiquity, he published it in 1740. The manuscript was likely copied sometime during or near the 8th century at Bobbio Abbey. A few lines of the Muratorian fragment were later found preserved in some codices of Paul&#x27;s Epistles at the Benedictine abbey of Monte Cassino. These documents date from the 11th and 12th centuries, and the copied lines largely concur with the Bobbio version with minor variations.

==Authorship and date==

The original author of the fragment is unknown. The text of the list itself is traditionally dated to the second half of the second century because the author refers to Pius I, bishop of Rome (140—155), as recent:
But Hermas wrote &quot;The Shepherd&quot; &quot;most recently in our time&quot;, in the city of Rome, while bishop Pius, his brother, was occupying the chair of the church of the city of Rome. And therefore it ought indeed to be read; but it cannot be read publicly to the people in church either among the Prophets, whose number is complete, or among the Apostles, for it is after their time.

Another reason suggesting a date toward the end of the second century is the concern with denouncing Marcion, a Christian bishop whose influence was the strongest in the second century, as well as Gnostics, who were also more prominent in the 2nd century than at later dates.

The document contains a list of books the Roman church of his era considered authoritative — a predecessor to what would become the New Testament. A similar list concerning the Old Testament likely preceded it, but if such a section was written, it was not preserved in the fragment. The fragment is in barbarous Latin which has probably been translated from an original in Greek, the language prevailing in the second century Christian community of Rome. Bruce Metzger has advocated the traditional dating, as has Charles E. Hill. A reason to suspect an origin in the Western church, other than the obvious of the manuscript being found in Italy, is the absence of the Epistle to the Hebrews in the list, which appears to have been more widely accepted in the Greek-speaking east of the Roman Empire than in the Western, Roman church.

Other scholars disagree with this dating, however. Albert Sundburg proposed a rival interpretation in 1973: that the fragment did not originate from Roman Christians, but rather the Greek-speaking east of the empire, and is dated to the fourth century due to its mention of the Apocalypse of Peter. In this interpretation, the reference to the Shepherd of Hermas merely meant &quot;recently&quot; in a broader sense of &quot;not stretching all the way back to the 1st century&quot;, in this view. Another option propounded by Clare Rothschild is that the fragment was written in Latin originally in the 4th century, possibly even later, and the reason for the awful Latin style was not poor translation but rather the copyist being unfamiliar with the abbreviation style used in the older manuscript. Rothschild also sees the fragment as a forgery attempting to portray itself as being written in the 2nd century, to explain the reference to the Shepherd and Pius. As an example, most scholars do not believe the Gelasian Decree to have been written by Pope Gelasius or even during his reign; similarly, it is possible that the writer was merely backdating their work by saying Pius was recent.

The theories for a later composition date have in general not prevailed over the existing scholarly consensus suggesting a second century date as the most likely. The Rothschild theory in particular has been criticized by scholar Christophe Guignard on many aspects.

== Contents ==
The unidentified author accepts four Gospels, the last two of which are Luke and John, but the names of the first two at the beginning of the list are missing. Scholars find it highly likely that the missing two gospels are Matthew and Mark, although this remains uncertain. Also accepted by the author are the &quot;Acts of all Apostles&quot; and 13 of the Pauline Epistles (the Epistle to the Hebrews is not mentioned in the fragment). The author considers spurious the letters claiming to have Paul as author that are ostensibly addressed to the Laodiceans and to the Alexandrians. Of these he says they are &quot;forged in Paul&#x27;s name to [further] the heresy of Marcion.&quot;

Of the General epistles, the author accepts the Epistle of Jude and says that two epistles &quot;bearing the name of John are counted in the catholic church&quot;. 1 Peter, 2 Peter, and James are not mentioned in the fragment. It is clear that the author assumed that the author of the Gospel of John was the same as the author of the First Epistle of John, for in the middle of discussing the Gospel of John he says &quot;what marvel then is it that John brings forward these several things so constantly &quot;in his epistles also,&quot; saying in his own person, &quot;What we have seen with our eyes and heard with our ears, and our hands have handled that have we written,&quot; (1 John 1:1) which is a quotation from the First Epistle of John. It is not clear whether the other epistle in question is 2 John or 3 John. Another indication that the author identified the Gospel writer John with two epistles bearing John&#x27;s name is that when he specifically addresses the epistles of John, he writes, &quot;the Epistle of Jude indeed, and the two belonging to &quot;the above mentioned John.&quot;&quot; In other words, he thinks that these letters were written by the John whom he has already discussed, namely John the gospel writer. He gives no indication that he considers the John of the Apocalypse to be a different John from the author of the Gospel of John. The author also includes the Book of Wisdom, &quot;written by the friends of Solomon in his honor&quot; [line 70] in the canon, and places the reference next to the epistles.

The fragment mentions two approved works of apocalyptic literature: the Apocalypse of John and the Apocalypse of Peter. The Apocalypse of John would go on to be better known as &quot;Revelation&quot; in the modern New Testament, while the Apocalypse of Peter would eventually fall out of favor in the 4th and 5th centuries. The author seems to think that the author of the Apocalypse of John (see debate on the authorship of Revelation) was a &quot;predecessor&quot; of Paul and wrote his epistles to the 7 churches first, although this dating does not match later scholarship, which believes Paul&#x27;s epistles predate the Apocalypse. The author also remarks that &quot;some of us will not allow [the Apocalypse of Peter] to be read in church&quot;. This hesitation with the Apocalypse of Peter would manifest in later centuries with it not being included in later canons. As the manuscript legacy for the Apocalypse of Peter is more sparse than books that made it into the New Testament, it is difficult to know how closely the Apocalypse of Peter read by the author of the fragment matches the few surviving manuscripts of it.

<doc id="376026" wikidata="Q276844" url="?curid=376026" title="Culture of Timor-Leste">
<text>The culture of Timor-Leste reflects numerous cultural influences, including Portuguese, Roman Catholic, and Malay, on the indigenous Austronesian cultures in Timor-Leste.

==UNESCO activities==
Timor-Leste become a state party to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention on 31 January 2017. It has yet to nominate possible inscriptions in any UNESCO networks such as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists, World Heritage List, World Network of Biosphere Reserves, Creative Cities Network, and Global Geoparks Network. Major contenders for the country includes Atauro Island, which Conservation International has cited as having the most biodiverse waters in the world, Cultural Landscape of the Fataluku, and Historic Monuments of Dili.

==Architecture==
East Timorese architecture and landscaping is a combination of both Portuguese and indigenous Timorese. Many heritage districts, heritage towns, and heritage structures have been retained in Timor-Leste, unlike its Southeast Asian neighbors whose architectural styles have been dreadfully replaced by modern and shanty structures that have destroyed cultural domains. Timor-Leste does not yet have a policy to conserve its architecture and landscapes, but is still one of the few nations in Asia to possess well-preserved indigenous architecture and colonial architecture. A proposal is also being made by some locals for the establishment of a law which mandates all villages to have a single architectural and landscaping style to preserve their village/town aesthetics and culture.

==Literature==

Easily the most famous East Timorese author is Xanana Gusmão, the leader of the Timorese resistance organization Fretilin, and former Prime Minister of independent East Timor. He wrote two books during the struggle for independence. Also a poet and painter, he produced works describing the culture, values, and skills of the Timorese people.

Other important writers of Timor include: Luís Cardoso, Fernando Sylvan, Ponte Pedrinha, Jorge Barros Duarte, Crisódio Araujo, Jorge Lauten, Francisco Borja da Costa, Afonso Busa Metan and Fitun Fuik.

==Music==
==Religion==
Timor-Leste has been nominally Catholic since early in the Portuguese colonial period. The Catholic faith became a central part of East Timorese culture during the Indonesian occupation between 1975 and 1999. While under Portuguese rule, the East Timorese had mostly been animist, sometimes integrated with minimal Catholic ritual, the number of Catholics dramatically increased under Indonesian rule. This was for several reasons: Indonesia was predominantly Muslim; the Indonesian state required adherence to one of six officially recognised religions and recognise traditional beliefs; and because the Catholic Church, which remained directly responsible to the Vatican throughout Indonesian rule, became a refuge for East Timorese seeking sanctuary from persecution.

The &#x27;Apostolic Administrator&#x27; (&quot;de facto&quot; Bishop) of the Diocese of Dili, Monsignor Martinho da Costa Lopes, began speaking out against human rights abuses by the Indonesian security forces, including rape, torture, murder, and disappearances. Following pressure from Jakarta, he stepped down in 1983 and was replaced by the younger priest, Monsignor Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, who Indonesia thought would be more loyal. However, he too began speaking out, not only against human rights abuses, but the issue of self-determination, writing an open letter to the Secretary General of the United Nations, calling for a referendum. In 1996 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with exiled leader José Ramos-Horta, now the country&#x27;s President.

However, in spite of the majority of the country&#x27;s people now being Catholics, there is freedom of religion in the new secular republic, and the former prime minister Marí Alkatiri, is a Muslim of Yemeni descent.

==Sports==

Timor-Leste has joined many international sport associations, including the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC board has granted full recognition to the East Timorese Olympic Committee (COTL). The IOC had allowed a mainly symbolic four-member team to take part in the 2000 Sydney Games under the Olympic flag as &quot;Independent Olympic Athletes.&quot; The Federação de Timor-Leste de Atletismo has joined the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The Federação de Badminton de Timor-Leste joined the International Badminton Federation (IBF) in April 2003. The East Timor Cycling Federation has joined the Union Cycliste Internationale. The Confederação do Desporto de Timor Leste has joined the International Weightlifting Federation. Timor-Leste is also a full member of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF).

Timor-Leste has taken part in several sporting events. Although the athletes came back with no medals, East Timorese athletes had the opportunity to compete with other Southeast Asian athletes in the 2003 Southeast Asian Games held in Vietnam in 2003. In the 2003 ASEAN Paralympics Games, also held in Vietnam, Timor-Leste won a bronze medal. In the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, six athletes participated in three sports: athletics, weightlifting and boxing. Timor-Leste won three medals in Arnis at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. Timor-Leste was also one of the competing nations in the first Lusophony Games, winning a bronze medal in the women&#x27;s volleyball competition (finishing third out of three teams), despite the fact the team had lost all its three games. On October 30, 2008, Timor-Leste earned their first international points in a FIFA match with a 2–2 draw against Cambodia.

== Horse racing ==
Horse Racing is a popular sport in Timor Leste. Although less than 14 hands high, the Timor pony is used. It is renowned for its agility and strength. Regional race meets are held throughout Timor-Leste.

== Film ==
An extensive collection of Timorese audiovisual material is held at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia. These holdings have been identified in a document titled The NFSA Timor-Leste Collection Profile, which features catalogue entries and essays for a total of 795 NFSA-held moving image, recorded sound and documentation works that have captured the history and culture of Timor-Leste since the early 20th century. The NFSA is working with the Timor-Leste government to ensure that all of this material can be used and accessed by the people of that country.

The extensive audiovisual material in the Max Stahl archive on the independence of Timor-Leste have been inscribed in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register in 2013 as &quot;Birth of a nation: turning points.&quot;

==Cuisine==

The cuisine of Timor-Leste consists of regional popular foods such as pork, fish, basil, tamarind, legumes, corn, rice, root vegetables, and tropical fruit. East Timorese cuisine has influences from Southeast Asian foods and from Portuguese dishes from its colonisation by Portugal. Flavours and ingredients from other former Portuguese colonies can be found due to the presence of Portuguese soldiers from other colonies in Timor-Leste.

== Public holidays ==
Timor-Leste now has public holidays that commemorate historic events in the liberation struggle, as well as those associated with Catholicism and Islam. They are defined in the Timor-Leste Law no. 10/2005.

<text>The Tamworth Manifesto was a political manifesto issued by Sir Robert Peel in December 1834 to the voters of Tamworth prior to the 1835 United Kingdom general election. It is widely credited by historians as having laid down the principles upon which the modern British Conservative Party is based.

In November 1834, King William IV removed the Whig Prime Minister Lord Melbourne and asked the Duke of Wellington, a Tory, to form a ministry. Wellington was reluctant; he formed a caretaker government but recommended that the king choose Peel, who was abroad. After Peel took over in December, an election was called. Perhaps owing to Wellington&#x27;s endorsement, Peel intended from the start, as the historian S. J. Lee tells, &quot;to fully convince the country and electorate that there was a substantial difference between his brand of conservatism and that of his predecessor and &#x27;old tory&#x27; Wellington.&quot;

With that in mind, on 18 December the Tamworth Manifesto was published by the press and read around the country. Like many other manifestos in nineteenth-century British politics it was formally an address to the electors of the leader&#x27;s own constituency, but reproduced widely. In the event Tamworth was uncontested in 1835: Peel and his brother William were the only candidates – they were elected, i.e. &quot;returned&quot;, unopposed. Nationally, Peel&#x27;s party made gains, but the Whigs retained an overall majority and Melbourne returned to power in April.

==Peel&#x27;s aims dictated in the Tamworth Manifesto==

The main aim of the manifesto was to appeal to the electorate in the new Parliament.
* Peel accepted that the Reform Act 1832 was &quot;a final and irrevocable settlement of a great constitutional question&quot;.
* He promised that the Conservatives would undertake a &quot;careful review of institutions, civil and ecclesiastical&quot;.
* Where there was a case for change, he promised &quot;the correction of proved abuses and the redress of real grievances&quot;.
* Peel offered to look at the question of church reform in order to preserve the &quot;true interests of the Established religion&quot;.
* Peel&#x27;s basic message, therefore, was that the Conservatives &quot;would reform to survive&quot;.
* However, he opposed what he saw as unnecessary change, fearing &quot;a perpetual vortex of agitation&quot;.

<doc id="376039" wikidata="Q801442" url="?curid=376039" title="Shinagawa Station">
<text>is a major railway station in the Takanawa and Konan districts of Minato, Tokyo, Japan, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and the private railway operator Keikyu. The Tokaido Shinkansen and other trains to the Miura Peninsula, Izu Peninsula, and the Tōkai region pass through here. Though a major station in Tokyo, Shinagawa is not served by the Tokyo subway network. However, it is connected to the Toei Asakusa Line via Keikyu through services.

Despite its name, the station is not located in Shinagawa ward. &quot;Shinagawa&quot; is also commonly used to refer to the business district around the station, which is in Takanawa and Konan neighborhoods of Minato, directly north of Shinagawa ward.

This station is just south of a large yard complex consisting of Shinagawa Carriage Sidings, Shinagawa Locomotive Depot, and Tamachi Depot.

==Lines==
Shinagawa is served by the following lines:

===JR Central===
* Tokaido Shinkansen

===JR East===
* 
* 

===Keikyu===
* Keikyu Main Line

JR Central announced in 2011 that Shinagawa will be the terminal for the Chūō Shinkansen, a maglev line under construction and scheduled to begin service to Nagoya in 2027.

==Station layout==
The main JR station concourse is situated above the platforms running east–west across the breadth of the station. A freely traversable walkway divides the station into two sections. The southerly section contains a number of shops and market-style stalls which form the &quot;e-cute&quot; station complex.

Cross-platform interchange between the Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines is only available for Yamanote Line trains to Shibuya and Keihin-Tōhoku Line trains to Tokyo. 

The Keikyu platforms are on the western side of the station at a higher level than the JR platforms. Some Keikyu trains terminate at Shinagawa while others continue on to join the Toei at .

New ground level Keikyu platforms are currently undergoing construction and are expected to be completed around 2030 as part of the Keikyu&#x27;s Continuous Grade Separation project.

The Shinkansen platforms were opened on October 1, 2003, to relieve
congestion at Tokyo Station. Platforms are on the east side of the station.

===JR platforms===





:Platform 8 is used for temporary timetables due to construction work or other obstructions elsewhere, or other special services and uses. As an example, in 2021, JR East stabled a Narita Express train at the platform and rented out seats as temporary teleworking spaces.

===Shinkansen platforms===

===Keikyu platforms===


==History==

Shinagawa is one of Japan&#x27;s oldest stations, opened on 12 June 1872, when the service between Shinagawa and Yokohama provisionally started, four months before the inauguration of &quot;Japan&#x27;s first railway&quot; between Shimbashi and Yokohama through Shinagawa on 14 October 1872. This line is a part of the Tōkaidō Main Line. Nothing remains of the original structure.

Later on 1 March 1885, the Yamanote Line started operation. Takanawa station of the Keikyu Line (then Keihin Railway Line) opened on 11 March 1924 across the street from Shinagawa station. Takanawa station was renamed Shinagawa station and moved to the current site on 1 April 1933.

The station concourse on the eastern side of the station (located above the platforms) was extensively redeveloped in 2003 in connection with the construction of the Shinkansen platforms and also to improve access to the new commercial development &quot;Shinagawa Intercity&quot;.

Keikyu introduced station numbering to its stations on 21 October 2010; Shinagawa was assigned station number KK01.

Station numbering was introduced to the JR East platforms in 2016 with Shinagawa being assigned station numbers JT03 for the Tokaido Line, JO17 for the Yokosuka Line, JK20 for the Keihin-Tohoku Line, and JY25 for the Yamanote Line. At the same time, JR East assigned the station a 3-letter code; Shinagawa was assigned the code &quot;SGW&quot;.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2017, the JR East station was used by an average of 378,566 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the fifth-busiest station operated by JR East. The passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

==Surrounding area==
===West side (Takanawa Exit)===
* Aqua Park Shinagawa
* National Route 15
* Shinagawa East One Tower

===East side (Konan Exit)===
* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology

==Bus services==
Services are provided by Toei Bus, Tokyu Bus, Keikyu Bus, Airport Transport Service, and others.

<text>John Doyle Lee (September 6, 1812 – March 23, 1877) was an American pioneer, and prominent early member of the Latter Day Saint Movement in Utah. Lee was later excommunicated from the Church and convicted of mass murder for his complicity in the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre. He was sentenced to death and, in 1877, was executed by firing squad at the site of the massacre.

==Early Mormon leader==
Lee was born on September 6, 1812, in Kaskaskia, Illinois Territory, and joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1838. He was a friend of Joseph Smith, founder of the church, and was the adopted son of Brigham Young under the early Latter Day Saint law of adoption doctrine. In 1839, Lee served as a missionary with his boyhood friend, Levi Stewart. Together they preached in Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. During this period Lee converted and baptized &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickman. Lee practiced plural marriage and had 19 wives (at least eleven of whom eventually left him) along with 56 children.

Lee was a member of the Danites, a fraternal vigilante organization. The Danites were first organized in Caldwell County, Missouri, during the Mormon War. Lee was also an official scribe for the Council of Fifty, a group of men who provided guidance in practical matters to the church, specifically concerning the move westward out of the established areas United States in the east to the Rocky Mountains. After Smith&#x27;s death, Lee went with Brigham Young and other Latter Day Saints to what is now Utah, and worked towards establishing several new communities there. Some of those communities included Lee&#x27;s Ferry and Lonely Dell Ranch, located near Page, Arizona. A successful and resourceful farmer and rancher, in 1856, Lee became a United States Indian Agent in the Iron County, Utah, area, where he was assigned to help Native Americans establish farms. In 1858, Lee served a term as a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature, and following church orders in 1872, Lee moved from Iron County and established a heavily used ferry crossing on the Colorado River, where the site is still called Lee&#x27;s Ferry. The nearby ranch was named the Lonely Dell Ranch and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, together with the ferry site.

== Mountain Meadows massacre ==
=== Massacre ===
In September 1857, the Baker–Fancher party, an emigrant group from Arkansas, camped at Mountain Meadows, a staging area in southern Utah used to prepare for the long crossing of the Mojave Desert by groups travelling westward to California. They were attacked by a combined group of Native Americans and Mormon militia men dressed as Native Americans. There were multiple motives for the conflict, including a general atmosphere of rising tensions between the US Federal government and Mormon settlers (see Utah War of 1857–1858) and a rumor that the Baker–Fancher party included those who had murdered Mormons at the 1838 event known as Haun&#x27;s Mill massacre.

On the third day of the siege, Lee (not dressed as a Native American) approached the Baker–Fancher encirclement under cover of a white flag and convinced the emigrants to surrender their weapons and property to the Mormons in return for safe conduct to nearby Cedar City. The emigrants accepted the offer and surrendered, however approximately 120 of the Baker–Fancher party were then killed by Mormon militia and Paiute Indians, leaving only about 17 small children as survivors. William Ashworth notes in his autobiography that after the massacre, the &quot;leaders among the white men had bound themselves under the most binding oaths to never reveal their part in it.&quot; Lee told Brigham Young that the Indians had been solely responsible, that &quot;no white men were mixed up in it.&quot; 

Lee later maintained that he had acted under orders from his militia leaders, under protest, and remained active in Mormonism and local government for several years afterwards. Lee was excommunicated in 1870 under mounting federal attention to the massacre.

=== Arrest and execution ===
In 1874, Lee was arrested and tried for leading the massacre. The first trial ended inconclusively with a hung jury, seemingly because of the prosecution&#x27;s attempt to portray Brigham Young as the true mastermind of the massacre. A second trial in 1876, in which the prosecution placed the blame squarely on Lee&#x27;s shoulders, ended with his conviction and he was sentenced to death. Lee never denied his own complicity, but claimed he had not personally killed anyone. He said he had been a vocally reluctant participant and later a scapegoat meant to draw attention away from other Mormon leaders who were also involved. Lee further maintained that Brigham Young had no knowledge of the event until after it happened. However, in the &quot;Life and Confessions of John D. Lee&quot; he (or an editor) wrote, &quot;I have always believed, since that day, that General George A. Smith was then visiting southern Utah to prepare the people for the work of exterminating Captain Fancher&#x27;s train of emigrants, and I now believe that he was sent for that purpose by the direct command of Brigham Young.&quot;

On March 23, 1877, Lee was executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on the site of the 1857 massacre. His last words included a reference to Young: &quot;I do not believe everything that is now being taught and practiced by Brigham Young. I do not care who hears it. It is my last word... I have been sacrificed in a cowardly, dastardly manner.&quot; On April 20, 1961, the LDS Church posthumously reinstated Lee&#x27;s membership in the church.

==Descendants==
Lee had 19 wives and 56 children, and his descendants are now numerous. Former solicitor general Rex E. Lee is a direct descendant of John Lee, as are his sons Senator Mike Lee of Utah and Utah Supreme Court justice Thomas R. Lee. Another descendant, Gordon H. Smith, was a U.S. senator from Oregon. U.S. representatives Mo Udall (D–AZ) and Stewart Udall (D–AZ) and their respective sons, senators Mark Udall (D–CO) and Tom Udall (D–NM) are also descendants. Stewart Udall served as United States Secretary of the Interior under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. See also the Lee–Hamblin family for a list of more of his noteworthy descendants.

==Film portrayals==
John Lee was portrayed by Jon Gries in the film &quot;September Dawn&quot; (2007).

<doc id="376042" wikidata="Q739465" url="?curid=376042" title="Study of the Hebrew language">
<text>As the Old Testament (known as the Tanakh) was written in Hebrew, Hebrew has been central to Judaism and Christianity for more than 2000 years.

==Jewish scholars of Hebrew==
The study of Hebrew occurred already in some grammatical notes in the Talmud and Midrash. The Masoretes continued the study as they fixed the text and vocalization of the Hebrew Bible. Under the influence of Arab grammarians, Rabbi Saadia Gaon (tenth century) made the Jewish study of Hebrew grammar almost scientific. Later Jewish grammarians include David Qimhi (known as the Radak), Abraham ibn Ezra and Judah ben David Hayyuj.

Eliezer Ben-Yehuda is the main revivalist of Hebrew as a modern spoken language, although in his book &quot;Language in Time of Revolution&quot;, Israeli scholar Benjamin Harshav diminishes Ben-Yehuda&#x27;s role and attributes the success of the revival to a wider movement in the Jewish society.

==Non-Jewish scholars of Hebrew==
The first major non-Jewish grammarian was John Reuchlin (16th century), but it was not until the early 19th century that Hebrew linguistics was studied in a secular, scientific way. The pioneer of this movement was Wilhelm Gesenius, who published thirteen editions of his &quot;Hebräische Grammatik&quot;. After Gesenius&#x27; death in 1842, the 14th through 21st editions were published by E. Rödiger, and the 22nd through 28th editions by Emil Kautzsch. Many of these editions were translated into English. The 28th edition was published in 1910 by A. E. Cowley and is known today simply as &quot;Gesenius&#x27; Hebrew Grammar&quot;. It became the standard Hebrew reference grammar, and although it is somewhat outdated by newer works, it is still widely used in the field in the 21st century.

The largest compendium of Hebrew grammatical material is König&#x27;s &quot;Historisch-Kritisches Lehrgebäude der Hebräischen Sprache&quot; (1881-97).

Paul Joüon&#x27;s &quot;Grammaire de l&#x27;hébreu biblique&quot; (1923) was recently edited and translated into English by Takamitsu Muraoka as &quot;A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew&quot; (1991; revised edition 2006). Muraoka made this into the most complete and up-to-date reference grammar. Also modern is Rudolf Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Hebräische Grammatik&quot; (1966-72), but it is not quite as thorough as Joüon-Muraoka. Of note as well is Mayer Lambert&#x27;s &quot;Traité de grammaire hébraïque&quot; (1931).

The most thorough, well-organized, and analytically incisive Hebrew grammar is the 29th edition of Gesenius&#x27; grammar by Gotthelf Bergsträsser. However, the author only managed to complete the sections on Phonology (1918) and the Verb (1929) before his untimely death. Although other grammars are more current, Bergsträsser&#x27;s is unsurpassed due to its depth and insight. Another excellent grammar is Hans Bauer and Pontus Leander&#x27;s &quot;Historische Grammatik der Hebräischen Sprache des Alten Testaments&quot; (1917-22) although it, too, lacks syntax. Neither grammar has been translated into English, although Bergsträsser&#x27;s has been translated into Hebrew (Jerusalem, 1972).

==Israeli scholars of Hebrew==
Modern Israeli scholars in the field of Hebrew linguistics include Naftali Herz Tur-Sinai, Chaim Menachem Rabin, E. Y. Kutscher, Shelomo Morag, Joshua Blau, Ze&#x27;ev Ben-Haim, Haiim B. Rosén, Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, Elisha Qimron and Moshe Bar-Asher.

==The Academy of the Hebrew Language== 
The Academy of the Hebrew Language (האקדמיה ללשון העברית) in modern Israel is the &quot;Supreme Foundation for the Science of the Hebrew Language&quot;, founded by the Israeli Government in 1953. It is responsible for coining neologisms to keep up with today&#x27;s rapidly changing society. It also has the &quot;final say&quot; concerning matters of spelling and grammar.

<doc id="376043" wikidata="Q16973160" url="?curid=376043" title="International Congress on Medieval Studies">
<text>The International Congress on Medieval Studies is an annual academic conference held for scholars specializing in, or with an interest in, medieval studies. It is sponsored by the Medieval Institute at the Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and is held during the first half of May. The Congress is the largest annual gathering in the field, regularly attracting over three thousand registered participants from all over the world. The 50th annual conference took place in 2015.

== History ==
In 1962, the newly established Institute for Medieval Studies at Western Michigan University organized a biennial gathering known as the Conference on Medieval Studies. By 1970, participation had grown significantly and the gathering was made an annual affair. Unusual for the time, the organizers issued calls for papers which were open to all in the field who were interested, including graduate students (see Scope and Participation, below). In the program of the 50th Congress, John Sommerfeldt reminisces about the inception of the humble conference as a place where &quot;bright young scholars could be heard.&quot; The torch, as Sommerfeldt puts it, has been carried respectably by subsequent directors of the Medieval Institute of Western Michigan University, with increasing numbers of participants and insightful new approaches to medieval studies. The directors, following John Sommerfeldt, include Otto Gründler, Paul E. Szarmach, James M. Murray, and the newly appointed Jana Schulman.

In 1973, the Institute for Cistercian Studies was established at Western Michigan, and began to hold its annual Cistercian Studies Conference as a sub-set of the International Congress on Medieval Studies.

The Medieval Academy of America has held its annual meetings at the Congress in 1974 and 1982. The academy began sponsoring a plenary session in 1992 and maintains a committee for this purpose.

In 2020, due to rise of COVID-19, the 55th International Congress on Medieval Studies was canceled. The Congress moved to a virtual format for 2021, with both live and prerecorded session and a virtual exhibits hall.

== Structure ==
The Congress is typically held during the first or second week of May, and runs from Thursday morning through Sunday afternoon. Most events are held on the West Campus of Western Michigan University.

The archived schedule of the 42nd International Congress on Medieval studies, held in May 2007, illustrates the structure and events of the Congress as described below.

=== Sessions ===
Sessions form the bulk of the activity at the Congress. There are three main types of sessions:
*The vast majority of sessions are presentations of research. These sessions typically consist of between two and four presentations given by scholars in the field who present papers or other updates on the findings of their current research. Each of these sessions is organized around a theme under which the constituent presentations fit.
*A minority of sessions are organized as roundtable discussions, in which a discussion on a predetermined topic takes place in at least a partially spontaneous manner. Short, prepared presentations are sometimes given as part of the roundtable.
*A few sessions are organized as workshops, in which attendees are active participants. These focus on the teaching and practice of new skills.

Many sessions have a sponsoring group, although individuals or the Congress may organize sessions. Many of the sessions are sponsored by academic associations, universities, or publishers, while others are arranged by &quot;ad hoc&quot; groups which are interested in a particular topic.

Approximately six hundred sessions are held across twelve different time slots during the four days. Each session is scheduled to last ninety minutes.

=== Plenary Lectures ===
Two plenary lectures are given during the conference, at the beginning of the day on Friday and Saturday.

=== Exhibits Hall ===
The exhibits hall is open during the length of the Congress, and is composed primarily of book publishers selling their latest titles in the field of medieval studies. A minority of the hall also features handcrafts, music, and foodstuffs for sale. In 2007, approximately seventy exhibitors participated.

=== Meetings ===
The Congress serves as a rare chance for international societies of medieval specialists to gather in person, and dozens of business meetings are conducted during breaks between sessions. Many groups use the opportunity to plan for their presentations later in the summer at the International Medieval Congress held at Leeds University.

=== Entertainment and Attractions ===
The Congress typically features a film festival, screening movies which have a medieval setting or theme. There are also performances of medieval music and theater.

Some participating organizations sponsor social gatherings in the form of wine hours or open bar receptions.

There are also demonstrations, to foster an understanding of material culture, that vary from year to year. Past demonstrations have included a trebuchet, a longboat, and most recently, a demonstration of blacksmithing.

The annual meeting of medievalists corresponds with the nesting of swans at Goldsworth pond, located at the very heart of the conference. Most years Congress ends before the eggs have hatched, but the 50th Congress was late enough that medievalists got to enjoy watching the cygnets get their sea legs. 

== Scope and Participation ==
The Congress is very broad in scope, being open to all topics related to the medieval period and to participants from any background. This has served to set it apart from other meetings in the field. Topics may range from discussions of mysticism, numismatics, and medieval Latin, to modern medieval-themed video games, the works of J. R. R. Tolkien, and the teaching of medieval studies in the classroom.

Such being the case, participants come from a broad variety of educational backgrounds. Most are professors and graduate students, but a significant minority is composed of architects, monks, undergraduate students, fiction authors, and other independent scholars and enthusiasts. Presenters are not necessarily experts in medieval history; scholars of literature, theater, religion, and art frequently give presentations.

<doc id="376045" wikidata="Q1394700" url="?curid=376045" title="Falls Creek Alpine Resort">
<text>The Falls Creek Alpine Resort is an alpine ski resort in the Hume region in northeastern Victoria, Australia. It is located in the Alpine National Park in the Victorian Alps, approximately by road from Melbourne, with the nearest town being Mount Beauty, which is approximately away. The resort lies between an elevation of above sea level, with the highest lifted point at . Skiing is possible on the nearby peak of Mount McKay at , accessed by snowcat from the resort.

The resort is an unincorporated area, directly administered by the government of Victoria, and surrounded by the Alpine Shire.

==Alpine resort==

Falls Creek is beginner/intermediate friendly, with almost 80% of the resort dedicated to these types of skiers/snowboarders. However, Australia&#x27;s notoriously fickle snow conditions ensure that snowmaking using the water from the nearby Rocky Valley Lake is sometimes, particularly early in the season, the main source of skiable snow. Consequently, like all Australian snowfields, Falls Creek&#x27;s customer base is almost entirely domestic, however many international cross country skiers travel to Falls Creek for the Kangaroo Hoppet, Australia&#x27;s Worldloppet event on the last Saturday of August and international snowboarders to Stylewars, The Australian Slopestyle Championships and Australia&#x27;s highest sanctioned event held in the first week of September.

The resort features 4500 accommodation beds, and consequently a large number of restaurants, bars and nightclubs to entertain guests at night. Some apartments are privately owned, but the resort&#x27;s management requires that they must be available for hire when not occupied.

The resort also serves as a summer base to explore the national park surrounding the resort.

Falls Creek is accessible by the Bogong High Plains Road from Mount Beauty all year round, though like all of Australia&#x27;s snow resorts snow chains must be carried during winter and fitted if directed. The road continues across the High Plains and descends to meet the Omeo Highway north of the hamlet of Anglers Rest, however the route from this side is closed during the snow season.

In summer both routes are popular with cyclists, and various cycling events are held that involve climbing to the resort, including the popular SCODY 3 Peaks Challenge (recently renamed to Falls Creek Peaks Challenge).

== Lift network ==
== History ==
After World War II, the Kiewa electrical scheme was started in the Kiewa River valley by the State Electricity Commission of Victoria. On land previously used only for summer cattle grazing in the natural alpine grasslands, the first ski lodge was built in 1948 by workers from the scheme. The first lift, a rope tow, was built in 1951 and the first chairlift in Australia was constructed there in 1957.

Falls Creek Post Office opened on 9 June 1958 (with telegraph and telephone facilities only until 1964).

The high plains in the area were used for summer cattle grazing from 1851 until 2005, when the Government of Victoria did not renew grazing licences due to concerns about the cattle&#x27;s impact on the fragile alpine environment. Some of the cattlemen&#x27;s huts still survive and are a tourist attraction in summer. Mount Bogong, Victoria&#x27;s highest mountain, is nearby. The nearest town to Falls Creek is Mount Beauty.

In 2019, Vail Resorts announced the acquisition of Falls Creek and Hotham for AU$174 million, and today they operate three of the largest ski resorts in Australia, including Perisher Ski Resort in New South Wales.

==Climate==
Falls Creek has a very cold Oceanic / Subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot; / &quot;Cfc&quot;) under the isotherm, or a Humid continental / Subarctic climate (&quot;Dfb&quot; / &quot;Dfc&quot;) under the isotherm, with short, cool summers and cold, very snowy winters. 

On 3 February 2023, Falls Creek reached a top of just . Falls Creek registered the lowest temperature recorded in Victoria (along with Omeo in June 1965); a reading of on 3 July 1970.

== Proposed developments ==
In 2009, the Falls Creek resort plan proposed replacing the Gully triple chair with a gondola, having a capacity of 1800 passengers per hour and a speed of up to 6 metres per second. This proposal also made its appearance in the 2016 masterplan, but nothing has resulted as of yet. It is worth noting that a gondola this short would be considerably expensive, where it would be much more cost effective to replace a much longer lift.

== Snowmaking ==
In 2021, Falls Creek invested AU$1.88 million into snowmaking machines. These new TechnoAlpin guns were placed along Wombats Ramble, Main Street and at the base of Drovers Dream. These snow machines now accompany the older snowmaking technology along Ruined Castle and Main Street.

== Notable seasons ==
2022 saw unusually large snowfalls in June, resulting in an established snowpack before the start of the ski season. As a result of this, Falls Creek and many other resorts opened to visitors one week early, with a snow depth of over 75cm at beginning of June.

<doc id="376046" wikidata="Q665817" url="?curid=376046" title="G-Saviour">
<text>is a 1999 Japan-US collaborative live-action television film created as part of the &quot;Gundam&quot; anime franchise, produced by Polestar Entertainment under the supervision of Sunrise and distributed by Bandai Visual.

The film was produced as part of the &quot;Gundam Big Bang Project&quot;, which was a series of works made to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. Set in the Universal Century timeline, &quot;G-Saviour&quot; was produced as a joint effort between the animation studio and creator of Gundam, Sunrise, and an independent film production company, Polestar Entertainment. The film was theatrically screened at a festival in Japan on June 18, 1999, and was first broadcast on December 29, 2000, from 16:00 to 17:25 on TV Asahi and its affiliate ANN stations.

==Plot==
The year is Universal Century 0223. The former Earth Federation has collapsed, and the space colonies have shaken off their colonial pasts and now refer to themselves as independent space &quot;Settlements&quot;. In this new power scheme two factions have emerged: the Congress of Settlement Nations (CONSENT), which is largely made up of the former Earth Federation government and Sides 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and the Settlement Freedom League, composed of Sides 1, 4, and the Lunar Cities.

Mark Curran is an ex-CONSENT pilot who now works for Hydro-Gen, an independent research facility located at the Deep Face Trench. While out on a harvesting run, Mark saves CONSENT lieutenant Tim Holloway. Shortly after the lieutenant is saved, the lab is commandeered by the Congressional Armed Forces, led by Mark&#x27;s former superior, Jack Halle. As the facility&#x27;s security system is triggered, Mark goes off to investigate. Mark saves one of the intruders, Cynthia Graves, from Jack&#x27;s firing squad after she surrenders, while another intruder is killed by the gunfire.

The CONSENT is in the midst of a global food shortage, with its military leaders threatening force to take over the neutral Side 8 Settlement of Gaea. General Garneuax asks Mark to interrogate Cynthia, who is revealed to be a Gaean rebel. Mark helps Cynthia escape, who shows him an enzyme that allows food to grow underwater, which can solve the food shortage. The two meet up with Cynthia&#x27;s interns, Franz Dieter and Kobi, and the group escape into space along with Mark&#x27;s fiancée Mimi Devere. Meanwhile, Jack frames Mark for the murder of a CONSENT soldier, whom Jack had killed himself. The group arrives at the Side 4 Settlement of New Manhattan, meeting with Philippe San Simeone, an old acquaintance of Mark, and a member of the Illuminati, a private paramilitary organization. Philippe entrusts Mark with a new prototype mobile suit, the G-Saviour, but he refuses to pilot it. Mark changes his mind to help clear a path through a debris field on the way to Gaea.

Arriving at Gaea, Mark and Cynthia meet with Chief Councilor Graves, Cynthia&#x27;s father. Graves tell them that a Congressional Armed Forces fleet is on its way to Gaea, looking to apprehend the two and the enzyme sample. After seeing Mark and Cynthia share a kiss, Mimi hacks into Gaea&#x27;s defense system, causing debris clearing guns to fire at a CONSENT ship. After Mark concludes that a mobile suit carrier is on its way to attack Gaea, Cynthia asks Mark to lead Gaea&#x27;s mobile suit force against the approaching CONSENT forces. Both sides launch their mobile suit forces, with CONSENT greatly outmatching Gaea&#x27;s obsolete RGM-196 Freedom mobile suits. Jack sorties out in the CAMS-13 MS-Rai, with Mark engaging him in battle with the G-Saviour. Congressional Armed Forces enter Gaea, with Kobi being critically wounded while trying to protect the enzyme sample. After retrieving the sample, Garneuax reveals his true intentions to destroy the sample and implement a policy of selective starvation across the CONSENT. With Gaea&#x27;s forces dwindling, Philippe and the Illuminati&#x27;s forces arrive and push back the CONSENT attack. Jack is defeated by Mark and the G-Saviour, who enter Gaea to disable the remaining CONSENT forces.

Garneuax and his forces, along with Mimi, escape from the Settlement in a Gaean space shuttle. Mimi reveals that she switched out the enzyme sample, which is back in the possession of Cynthia, as the shuttle is shot down by CONSENT forces. With Garneuax dead and Jack incapacitated, the Congressional Armed Forces withdraw from Gaea. Councilor Graves gives a speech stating that Side 8 will stay independent, while Mark returns to Earth with Cynthia.

==Cast==
==Production==
In October 1995, work began on the &quot;G-Saviour&quot; multimedia project, beginning with the production of a promotional trailer to pitch the film to Sunrise. This promotional trailer was completed in March 1997.

Production on the film began in June 1998 and was intended, along with the &quot;Turn-A Gundam&quot; television series, to be the centerpiece of the &quot;Gundam Big Bang Project&quot;, which was the 20th anniversary celebration for the popular &quot;Gundam&quot; metaseries. The &quot;G-Saviour&quot; film is part of the &quot;G-Saviour&quot; multimedia project, which encompasses several forms of media, including a radio drama, novel, and video game. &quot;Gundam&quot; co-creator Yoshiyuki Tomino was not involved in this production.

The film&#x27;s actors are predominantly from Canada, and the Japanese language version has Japanese dubbed into the film. Most of the set locations, such as the Orpheum Theatre and Simon Fraser University Burnaby campus, were located in the Metro Vancouver area in British Columbia, Canada.

&quot;G-Saviour&quot; is unique among &quot;Gundam&quot; animated and live-action properties in that the word &quot;Gundam&quot; is not in the title, or used at all throughout the film&#x27;s run. It was the second attempt at producing a live-action &quot;Gundam&quot; feature, after the 1997 interactive video game &quot;Gundam 0079: The War for Earth&quot;.

==Home video==
The film was released on DVD on January 22, 2002.

==Media==
===Radio drama===
Prior to the television broadcasting, a radio drama series which takes place before the events of the film was broadcast on Japanese FM radio stations. These radio dramas were subsequently released on CD in December 2000 onward as part of a &quot;Sound Cinema&quot; series by Pioneer LDC.
# G-Saviour Sound Cinema 01: Red Wings of Icarus
# G-Saviour Sound Cinema 02: Before the Mission
# G-Saviour Sound Cinema 03: Deep Sea Prometheus

===Novelisation===
A novelisation of the film&#x27;s events was released across two volumes as part of the Shueisha D Superdash Bunko series. The novelisation was released in Japan during December 2000 and was written by Yoshie Kawahara with illustrations by Masahisa Suzuki.

===Video game===
Sunrise Interactive published the &quot;G-Saviour&quot; video game, which was an action game developed by Atelier Sai, for the PlayStation 2 on September 14, 2000. The game&#x27;s story takes place after the events of the film with new characters continuing the overall story arc from the movie as well as featuring Mobile Suits that are exclusive to the game . This game was the first &quot;Gundam&quot; game released for the PlayStation 2.

A three part manga was serialised in Famitsu which elaborated upon the story during the first two stages of the game. This manga has not subsequently been collected in any compilation volume.

===Music===


==Reception==
&quot;G-Saviour&quot; has received a mixed reception. An Anime News Network review calls the film &quot;a pleasing mix of both science fiction and adventure&quot; while MAHQ, a dedicated mecha website, was critical of the &quot;extremely clichéd Hollywood-style writing&quot;. Criticism has been levelled at the application of the titular mobile suits during the film, with one review stating &quot;while the CGI effects look great, most familiar with the anime series on which this was based will complain the &#x27;suits&#x27; were not utilized as well as they might have been&quot;.

<text>In denominations of Christianity, a godparent or sponsor is someone who bears witness to a child&#x27;s baptism (christening) and later is willing to help in their catechesis, as well as their lifelong spiritual formation. In both religious and civil views, a godparent tends to be an individual chosen by the parents to take an interest in the child&#x27;s upbringing and personal development, and to offer mentorship. A male godparent is a godfather, and a female godparent is a godmother. The child is a godchild (i.e., godson for boys and goddaughter for girls).

==Christianity==

===Origins and history===

As early as the 2nd century AD, infant baptism had begun to gain acceptance among Christians for the spiritual purification and social initiation of infants.

Normally, these sponsors were the birth parents of a child, as emphasized in 408 by St. Augustine who suggested that the sponsors could be other individuals in exceptional circumstances. Within a century, the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis&quot; indicates that parents had been replaced in this role almost completely by those who were not the child&#x27;s birth parents. This was clarified in 813 when the Synod of Mainz prohibited natural parents from acting as godparents to their own children.

By the 5th century, male sponsors were referred to as &quot;spiritual fathers&quot;, and by the end of the 6th century, they were being referred to as &quot;compaters&quot; and &quot;commaters&quot;, suggesting that these were being seen as spiritual co-parents. Around the same time, laws intended to prevent marriage between family members were extended to include marriage between god-parents and god-children. A decree of Justinian, dated to 530, outlawed marriage between a godfather and his goddaughter, and these barriers continued to multiply until the 11th century, forbidding marriage between natural and spiritual parents, or those directly related to them. As confirmation emerged as a separate rite from baptism from the 8th century, a second set of sponsors, with similar prohibitions, also emerged. The exact extent of these spiritual relationships as a bar to marriage in Catholicism was unclear until the Council of Trent, which limited it to relationships between the godparents, the child, and the parents.

====During the Reformation====
Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin preserved infant baptism (and the accompanying baptismal sponsors) in their respective Protestant denominations despite opposition from more radical reformers such as Anabaptists. Their respective visions of the role played by godparents differed from mainstream Catholicism. Luther was opposed to the prohibition of marriage between god-parents and -children, Zwingli placed more emphasis on the role played by the parents and pastors, and Calvin preferred the birth parents serving as sponsors. Among French Calvinists and the residents of Geneva, it became the norm to have one godparent; other Calvinists, most notably in Scotland and the English colonies in America, did away with them entirely. 

The customary obligation of godfathers for Catholics (at least in Scotland) was stated in Nicol Burne&#x27;s &quot;Of the praying in Latine&quot; (1581) in relation to Latin public prayers in church:

...if any man pray in any other tongue (i.e. than his own), it is also expedient that he understand the meaning of the words at the least. For the which cause in the catholic church the parents or godfathers are obliged to learn them (i.e. to make sure they have learned) whom they held in baptism the forms of prayers and belief, and instruct them sufficiently therein, so that they understand the same:

====Numbers of sponsors====

In the early church, one sponsor seems to have been the norm, but in the early Middle Ages, there seems to have been two, one of each sex, and this practice has been largely maintained in Orthodox Christianity. In 888, the Catholic Council of Metz attempted to limit the number to one, but this limit seems not to have been observed. In early 14th-century Spain, as many as 20 godparents were being chosen for a single child. In England, the Synod of Worcester (1240) stipulated three sponsors (two of the same sex and one of the opposite), and this has remained the norm in the Church of England. The Council of Trent attempted to limit the numbers of godparents to one or two, but practice has differed across the Catholic world.

===Modern practices===

====Anglican Communion====
The Church of England, the mother Church of the Anglican Communion, retained godparents in baptism, formally removing the marriage barriers in 1540, but the issue of the role and status of godparents continued to be debated in the English Church. They were abolished in 1644 by the Directory of Public Worship promulgated by the English Civil War Parliamentary regime, but continued to be used in some parishes in the north of England. After the Restoration in 1660, they were reintroduced to Anglicanism, with occasional objections, but dropped by almost every dissenting church. There is some evidence that the restored institution had lost some of its social importance as well as its universality.

At present, in the Church of England, relatives can stand as godparents, and although it is not clear that parents can be godparents, they sometimes are. Godparents should be both baptised and confirmed (although it is not clear in which Church), but the requirement for confirmation can be waived. There is no requirement for clergy to baptise those from outside their parishes, and baptism can be reasonably delayed so that the conditions, including suitable godparents, can be met. As a result, individual clergy have considerable discretion over the qualifications of godparents. Many &quot;contemporary Anglican rites likewise require parents and godparents to respond on behalf of infant [baptismal] candidates.&quot;

====Lutheran churches====
Lutherans follow a similar theology of godparents as Catholics. They believe that godparents &quot;help [children] with their Christian upbringing, especially if they should lose their parents&quot;. Lutherans, like Catholics, believe that a godparent must be both a baptized and confirmed Christian. Some Lutherans also follow the Catholic tradition that a Christian who is not affiliated with the Lutheran denomination may serve as a witness rather than a godparent.

====Methodist Church====
The Book of Discipline stipulates that it is the duty of a godparent, also known as a sponsor, &quot;to provide training for the children of the Church throughout their childhood that will lead to a personal commitment to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, to an understanding of the Christian faith, and to an appreciation of the privileges and obligations of baptism and membership (¶ 225.4).&quot; John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church, wrote a homily titled &quot;Serious Thoughts Concerning Godfathers and Godmothers&quot; in which he stated that godparents are &quot;spiritual parents to the baptized, whether they were infants or [adults]; and were expected to supply whatever spiritual helps were wanting either through the death or neglect of the natural parents.&quot; He described the role of godparents, instructing that they should call upon their godchild &quot;to hear sermons, and shall provide that he(/she) may learn the Creed, the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, and all other things which a Christian ought to know and believe to his soul&#x27;s health; and that this child be virtuously brought up, to lead a godly and a Christian life.&quot; As such, the Book of Worship states that godparents/sponsors should be &quot;selected carefully&quot; and &quot;should be members of Christ&#x27;s holy Church; and it is the duty of pastors to instruct them concerning the significance of Holy Baptism, their responsibilities for the Christian training of the baptized child, and how these obligations may be fulfilled.&quot;

====Orthodox Church====
The Orthodox institution of godparenthood has been the least affected of the major traditions by change. In some Orthodox churches (Serbian, Greek) usually the best man (kum, кум, koumbaros) or bridesmaid (kuma, кума, koumbara) at a couple&#x27;s wedding act as a godparent to the first or all children of the marriage. In some instances, the godfather is responsible for naming the child. A godparent to a child will then act as a sponsor at the child&#x27;s wedding. Godparents are expected to be in good standing in the Orthodox church, including its rulings on divorce, and aware of the meaning and responsibilities of their role.

====Reformed Churches====
In the Reformed tradition that includes the Continental Reformed, Congregationalist and Presbyterian Churches, the godparents are more often referred to as &quot;sponsors&quot;, who have the role of standing with the child during infant baptism and pledging to instruct the child in the faith. In the baptismal liturgy of Reformed Geneva, &quot;the traditional presence of godparents was retained&quot;. John Calvin, the progenitor of the Reformed tradition, himself served as a godparent during forty-seven baptisms. The Reformed Church in Geneva, in order to ensure confessional orthodoxy, &quot;expected parents to select Reformed godparents.&quot; Today, many Reformed churches invite parents to select godparents for their prospective neophyte, while other parishes entrust this responsibility to the whole congregation.

====Catholic Church====

The Catholic institution of godparenthood survived the Reformation largely unchanged. A godparent must normally be an appropriate person, at least sixteen years of age, a confirmed Catholic who has received the Eucharist, not under any canonical penalty, and may not be the parent of the child. Someone who belongs to another Christian church cannot become a godparent but can be a &#x27;witness&#x27; in conjunction with a Catholic sponsor. A witness does not have any religious role recognized by the Church.

In 2015, the Vatican declared that transgender Catholics cannot become godparents, stating in response to a transgender man&#x27;s query that transgender status &quot;reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one&#x27;s own sexuality&quot; and that, &quot;[t]herefore it is evident that this person does not possess the requirement of leading a life according to the faith and in the position of godfather and is therefore unable to be admitted to the position of godfather or godmother.&quot; The Vatican reversed this stance in 2023, noting, however, that, a transgender person may still be denied godparenthood if &quot;there is a danger of scandal, undue legitimisation or disorientation in the educational sphere of the church community&quot;.

===Spiritual kinship===

In some Catholic and Orthodox countries, particularly in southern Europe, Latin America, and the Philippines, the relationship between parents and godparents or co-godparents has been seen as particularly important and distinctive. These relationships create mutual obligations and responsibilities that may be socially useful for participants. The Portuguese and Spanish &quot;compadre&quot; (literally, &quot;co-father&quot;) and &quot;comadre&quot; (&quot;co-mother&quot;), the French &quot;marraine&quot; and &quot;parrain&quot;, and the archaic meaning of the English word &quot;gossip&quot; (from &quot;godsib,&quot; &quot;godsibling&quot;), describe these relationships.

The Spanish and Portuguese words for the godparent roles are used for members of the wedding party—&quot;padrino/padrinho&quot; meaning &quot;godfather&quot; or &quot;best man&quot; and &quot;madrina/madrinha&quot; meaning &quot;godmother&quot; or &quot;matron of honor&quot;, reflecting the custom of baptismal sponsors acting in this role in a couple&#x27;s wedding.

===Literature and folklore===

Godparents are noted features of fairy tales and folklore written from the 17th century onwards, and by extension, have found their way into many modern works of fiction. In &quot;Godfather Death&quot;, presented by the Brothers Grimm, the archetype is, unusually, a supernatural godfather. However, most are a fairy godmother as in versions of &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;The Blue Bird&quot;. This feature may simply reflect the Catholic milieu in which most fairy tales were created, or at least recorded, and the accepted role of godparents as helpers from outside the family, but English historian Marina Warner suggests that they may be a form of wish fulfilment by female narrators.

==Non-Christian traditions==

===Santería===

In the Yoruba-derived Santería from Cuba, godparents must have completed their santo or their Ifá. A person gets his Madrina and Yubona (co-godmother) or his Padrino and Yubon (co-godfather). A santero, aside from his co-godparents, may have an oluo (babalawo, initiate of ifa) who consults him with an ekuele (divining chain).

===Judaism===
There are two roles in the Jewish circumcision ceremony that are sometimes translated as &quot;godparent&quot;. The sandek, in Orthodox Judaism a man, sits on a specially designated chair, and holds the baby boy while he is circumcised.

Among Orthodox Ashkenazi, the kvater is the married couple who bring the child from his mother to where the circumcision is performed. The mother gives the baby to the woman, who gives the baby to her husband, who then carries the baby the rest of the way. The announcement &quot;Kvatter&quot; is the signal for the man to walk to where he will get the baby, and also for that man&#x27;s wife to walk to the lady holding the baby (usually the mother), if she is not already standing there.

Kvater is etymologically derived from the archaic German &quot;Gevatter&quot; (&quot;godfather&quot;). Historically, the Jewish ‘Godfather’ bears responsibility for seeing that the child is properly raised, if both parents die young. Amongst the Kvater&#x27;s many responsibilities, he is also obligated to ensure that the Godmother (should one be appointed) is fully capable of discharging her duties. Should he deem her irresponsible, he can revoke her status as Godmother by proclamation.

===Humanism===
Humanists use the term guideparent for a similar concept in that worldview.

===Chinese traditions===
Some Chinese communities practise the custom of matching a child with a relative or family friend who becomes the godmother (&quot;yimu&quot; / &quot;ganma&quot; 義母/乾媽) or godfather (&quot;yifu&quot; / &quot;gandie&quot; 義父/乾爹). This practice is largely non-religious in nature, but commonly done to strengthen ties or to fulfil the wish of a childless adult to have a &quot;son/daughter&quot;. In most circumstances, an auspicious day is selected on which a ceremony takes place, involving the godchild paying his/her respects to his new godfather/godmother in the presence of relatives or friends.

Alternatively, as it is already common in Chinese kinship to use kinship terms among people that are not related (e.g. addressing a respected coworker as &quot;brother&quot; or one&#x27;s father&#x27;s friend may be referred to as &quot;uncle&quot;), an older friend or family friend with a deep friendship and a sufficient age gap will also informally address the other as his godparent or godchild, a gesture often initiated by the older person.

=== Kirvelik ===
In some parts of Turkey, mainly in the eastern, Kurdish-majority regions, a kind of fictive kinship relationship called &quot;kirvelik&quot; exists connected with the Islamic ritual of circumcision. The man who holds a male child who is being circumcised becomes the &quot;kirîv&quot; of the child; at the same time, the &quot;kirîv&quot; and the boy&#x27;s parents become &quot;kirîv&quot;s in relation to each other. &quot;Kirvelik / kirîvahî&quot; comes with particular duties, responsibilities and traditions. It has been compared to &quot;compadrazgo&quot; in Latin America and &quot;kumstvo&quot; in the Balkans.

<text>An aunt is a woman who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent. Aunts who are related by birth are second-degree relatives. Alternate terms include auntie or aunty.

Aunt, auntie, and aunty also may be titles bestowed by parents and children to close friends of one or both parents who assume a sustained caring or nurturing role for the children. Children in some cultures and families may refer to the cousins of their parents as aunt or uncle due to the age and generation gap. The word comes from via Old French &quot;ante&quot; and is a family relationship within an extended or immediate family.

The male counterpart of an aunt is an uncle, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece. The gender-neutral term pibling, a shortened form of &quot;parent&#x27;s sibling&quot;, may refer to either an aunt or an uncle.
==Types==
* A half-aunt is a half-sister of a parent.
* A maternal aunt is the sister of one&#x27;s mother.
* A paternal aunt is the sister of one&#x27;s father.
* An aunt-in-law is the aunt of one&#x27;s spouse.
* A parent&#x27;s first cousin may be called a second aunt.
* A great-aunt or grandaunt (sometimes written grand-aunt) is the sister of one&#x27;s grandparent.

==Genetics and consanguinity==

Aunts by birth (sister of a parent) are related to their nieces and nephews by 25%. As half-aunts are related through half-sisters, they are related by 12.5% to their nieces and nephews. Non-consanguineous aunts (female spouse of a relative) are not genetically related to their nieces and nephews.

==Cultural variations==
In some cultures, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of Australia, respected senior members of the community, often also referred to as Elders, are addressed as &quot;uncle&quot; (for men) and &quot;aunt&quot; for women, as a mark of seniority and respect, whether related or not, such as Aunty Kathy Mills.

In several cultures, no single inclusive term describing both a person&#x27;s kinship to their parental female sibling or parental female in-law exists.

<doc id="376053" wikidata="Q1821910" url="?curid=376053" title="Levin, New Zealand">
<text>Levin (; ) is the largest town and seat of the Horowhenua District, in the Manawatū-Whanganui region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located east of Lake Horowhenua, around north of Wellington and southwest of Palmerston North.

The town has a population of making it the 30th largest urban area in New Zealand, and third largest in Manawatū-Whanganui behind Palmerston North and Whanganui.

Levin is a service centre for the surrounding rural area, and a centre for light manufacturing.

To the west of the main town lies Lake Horowhenua, which covers some . It is currently undergoing regeneration.

==History==

===19th century===

The area now occupied by Levin was connected to both Wellington and Palmerston North by railway in 1886. The area was surveyed in 1888, and European settlement began following the sale of suburban and rural sections, which commenced on 19 March 1889.

The town was named after William Hort Levin, a director of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company.

The name is a variation of the Jewish clan name Levi. Unlike the usual pronunciation of the surname, stress is placed on the &quot;second&quot; syllable of the word. However Levin&#x27;s great-grandson, Peter Levin, claims his forebear would have pronounced his surname as &quot;Levene&quot;, and that this pronunciation was in common use for many years and is always used by the family.
Peter Levin adds to his former comment regarding the pronunciation of Levin. From his earliest memories, Peter, born in Wellington in 1932, says that &quot;Levene&quot; was in common use not only by the family but by all older people indeed his Father born in 1904 used &quot;Levene&quot; until his death aged 96 in 2001

=== 20th century—present ===

Levin was made a borough in 1906.

The Levin clock tower was built in 1999 as a donation by the Levin Rotary Club after some fundraising. It was described as &quot;iconic&quot; to the town by the &quot;Manawatū Standard&quot;. It has four clocks, one for every side, each with an independent motor, and has a temperature gauge.

===2024 car rally===
On Saturday, 1 June 2024 a car rally locally known as &quot;the Levin car invasion&quot; took place. With 200 cars and 500 people in attendance, they started at the intersection of Queen Street and State Highway 57 before the police removed them. The convoy then moved to Miro Street in Ōtaki before returning to Levin, now at the intersection of State Highway 1 and Queen Street. Once they arrived back in Levin, the Police tried to stop the group however the police were attacked. In an interview the &quot;organizer&quot; said &quot;What we&#x27;re doing is illegal, but until we get a proper skid pad or somewhere safe to do it we&#x27;re going to keep doing it on the streets.&quot;

== Marae ==
Kawiu Marae and Te Huia o Raukura meeting house, located just north of the town, are a meeting place for Muaūpoko.

In October 2020, the Government committed $945,445 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Kawiu Marae and nearby Kohuturoa Marae, creating 50 jobs.

<doc id="376068" wikidata="Q313517" url="?curid=376068" title="The Gideons International">
<text>Gideons International is an evangelical Christian association for men founded in 1899 in Janesville, Wisconsin, whose primary activity is distributing free copies of the Bible worldwide. It distributes complete Bibles or portions thereof in over 100 languages, most widely known in lodging rooms, in addition to medical facilities, schools, military bases, as well as jails and prisons. The association takes its name from the Biblical figure Gideon depicted in Judges 6.

In 1908, the Gideons began distributing free Bibles. The first Bibles were placed in rooms of the Superior Hotel in Superior, Montana. Members of The Gideons International currently average distribution of over 70 million Bibles annually. On average, more than two copies of the Bible are distributed per second through Gideons International. As of April 2015, Gideons International has distributed over 2.5 billion Bibles. 

The headquarters of Gideons International is in Nashville, Tennessee.

==History==
The organization began in the fall of 1898, when two traveling salesmen, John H. Nicholson of Janesville, Wisconsin, and Samuel E. Hill of Beloit, Wisconsin, met in a hotel room they shared at the Central House Hotel in Boscobel, Wisconsin, and discussed the formation of an association. In May 1899, the two met again in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, where they decided the goal of their association would be to unite traveling salesmen for evangelism. In July 1899, Nicholson, Hill, and Will J. Knights met at the YMCA in Janesville. Two of them continued with the distribution of the Bibles. Gideons began distributing free Bibles, the work they are most known for, in 1908, when the first Bibles were placed in the rooms of the Superior Hotel in Superior, Montana.

The organization describes its connection to the story of Gideon:

&quot;Gideon was a man who was willing to do exactly what God wanted him to do, regardless of his own judgment as to the plans or results. Humility, faith, and obedience were his great elements of character. This is the standard that The Gideons International is trying to establish in all its members, each man to be ready to do God&#x27;s will at any time, at any place, and in any way that the Holy Spirit leads.&quot;

In keeping with this symbolism, the symbol of the Gideons is a two-handled pitcher and torch recalling Gideon&#x27;s victory over the Midianites as described in Judges 7.

==Membership==

As of 2022, The Gideons reported having 269,500 members in 200 countries and territories.

Membership in The Gideons International generally constitutes current or retired business or professional men (except clergy) aged 21 or older who are members in good standing of an evangelical or Protestant church and adhere to the core spiritual beliefs of the organization. Wives of Gideons may similarly join the Auxiliary of The Gideons International.

==Programs==

In addition to their well-known hotel room Bibles, members of The Gideons International also distribute Bibles to members of the military of various countries, to hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, MPs and students.

==Testaments distributed==

A typical Bible or New Testament from The Gideons International contains:
* a short preface;
* a pamphlet suggesting Bible verses that may be of assistance in various sorts of trouble;
* translations of John 3:16 into a variety of languages and scripts;
* the Bible text itself, without notes, references, or any other reference matter other than chapter and verse headings; this can either be the full Bible (typical of the copies placed in hotel rooms), or just the New Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs (typical of the copies handed out as gifts to individuals);
* a short description of the evangelical understanding of salvation, with biblical quotations, and a place for the reader to sign and date their confession of Jesus as their savior (this is especially common in the shorter editions featuring the New Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs).

===Colors of Testaments distributed===


The covers of the New Testaments distributed by Gideons are color-coded based on which groups they are intended for:
* Orange: given in sidewalk distribution
* Green: for college/university students
* Red: for in-school distribution to middle/high school students
* Digital camouflage/desert camouflage: for the military
* Dark blue: printed in a language other than English, some also went to county jails
* White: for medical professionals
* Light blue: for distribution by the Auxiliary only
* Brown: for jail and prison facilities
* Burgundy: personal worker&#x27;s testaments (for individual witnessing by Gideons)
* Periwinkle: personal worker&#x27;s testaments (for individual witnessing by the Auxiliary)

During World War II there were military-issued New Testaments, brown for Army and blue for Navy, distributed by the Gideons. In addition to desert camouflage and digital camouflage, there are also woodland camouflage editions for the military.

==Distribution of Bibles on public school grounds==

The distribution of Bibles on public school grounds has been an issue because of the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Establishment Clause in the Constitution. Five Supreme Court cases discuss this issue: &quot;Everson&quot;, &quot;McCollum&quot;, &quot;Zorach&quot;, &quot;Engel&quot;, and &quot;Schempp&quot;.

In 2008, Americans United for Separation of Church and State brought suit against the South Iron R-1 School District in Missouri for allowing the Gideons to distribute Bibles during class time. In 2009, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis upheld a lower court ruling that found the South Iron district&#x27;s distribution of Bibles to the schoolchildren in their classrooms was unconstitutional. An &quot;attorney representing the South Iron School District in Annapolis, Mo., said the decision allows a new policy to finally be implemented, one that allows any group to hand out literature at the rural district, including information on how children can obtain Bibles.&quot;

The Gideons International continues to contact youth in the United States through The Life Book, coordinating with churches and their youth to distribute copies of the Bible in high schools. The Alliance Defending Freedom, as of 2013, maintains that there are &quot;constitutionally permissible ways in which Gideons Bibles may be distributed,&quot; and attorneys Rory Gray and Jeremy Tedesco write that the Alliance Defending Freedom sent letters to 174 school districts in Kentucky stating: &quot;Federal caselaw overwhelmingly supports the decision to grant religious and non-religious community groups an equal opportunity to provide literature to willing students.&quot; In early 2014, the &quot;Gideons International again distributed Bibles at a public elementary school in Kentucky.&quot;

<text>William Richard Frisell (born March 18, 1951) is an American jazz guitarist. He first came to prominence at ECM Records in the 1980s, as both a session player and a leader. He went on to work in a variety of contexts, notably as a participant in the Downtown Scene in New York City, where he formed a long working relationship with composer and saxophonist John Zorn. He was also a longtime member of veteran drummer Paul Motian&#x27;s groups from the early 1980s until Motian&#x27;s death in 2011. Since the late 1990s, Frisell&#x27;s output as a bandleader has also integrated prominent elements of folk, country, rock ‘n’ roll and Americana. He has six Grammy nominations and one win.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Frisell was born in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, but spent most of his youth in the Denver, Colorado area. He studied clarinet with Richard Joiner of the Denver Symphony Orchestra as a youth, but by his teens was more interested in guitar. He graduated from Denver East High School and went to the University of Northern Colorado to study music. At UNC, he took a class taught by guitarist Johnny Smith. However, Frisell later reported the class effectively became private lessons from Smith because the emphasis on music theory &quot;was too much for everyone else—they didn&#x27;t want to be learning scales and inversions.&quot;

His original guitar teacher in the Denver-Aurora metropolitan area was Dale Bruning, with whom Frisell released the 2000 duo album &quot;Reunion&quot;. After graduating from Northern Colorado, Frisell went to the Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he studied with Jon Damian and Jim Hall.

===ECM Records years===
Frisell&#x27;s major break came when guitarist Pat Metheny was unable to make a recording session and recommended Frisell to Paul Motian, who was recording &quot;Psalm&quot; (1982) for ECM Records. Frisell became ECM&#x27;s in-house guitar player through the 1980s and worked on several albums, including notably Jan Garbarek&#x27;s 1982 &quot;Paths, Prints&quot;. Frisell&#x27;s first release under his name was &quot;In Line&quot; (1983), which featured a solo guitar as well as duets with bassist Arild Andersen.

===New York City era===
In the 1980s, Frisell moved to Hoboken, New Jersey and was active in the New York jazz scene. He forged an early partnership with John Zorn—including as a member of avant-garde jazz band Naked City—and performed or recorded with many others. He also played in Paul Motian&#x27;s trio, along with saxophonist Joe Lovano.

Frisell organized a regular working group in the mid-1980s consisting of Kermit Driscoll on bass, Joey Baron on drums, and Hank Roberts on cello (later reduced to a trio when Roberts left). For studio projects, this group was regularly joined by other musicians.

===Seattle years===
In 1988, Frisell left New York City and moved to Seattle, Washington. In the early 1990s Frisell made two of his best-reviewed albums: first, &quot;Have a Little Faith&quot;, an ambitious survey of Americana of all stripes, from Charles Ives and Aaron Copland (the entirety of &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;) to John Hiatt (the title song), Bob Dylan (&quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;) and Madonna (a lengthy, psychedelic rock-tinged version of &quot;Live to Tell&quot;); and second, &quot;This Land&quot;, a complementary set of originals. During this time, he performed with many musicians, including up-and-coming performers such as Douglas September on the album &quot;10 Bulls&quot;. He also branched out by performing soundtracks to silent films of Buster Keaton with his trio and contributed to Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s album &quot;Heartbeat&quot;.

In the mid-1990s, Frisell disbanded his trio. He continued the trend marked by &quot;Have a Little Faith&quot; by more explicitly incorporating elements of bluegrass and country music into his music. His friendship with Gary Larson led him to provide music for the TV version of &quot;The Far Side&quot; (released on the album &quot;Quartet&quot; along with music written for Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Convict 13&quot;). Since 2000, Frisell has lived on Bainbridge Island, Washington, near Seattle.

==2000 to present==

Several of Frisell&#x27;s songs, including his recording of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Coffaro&#x27;s Theme,&quot; originally composed in 1995 for an Italian movie, &quot;La scuola&quot;, were featured in the film &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; in 2000.

In 1999 Frisell was commissioned by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to compose &quot;Blues Dream&quot;, which he premiered on November 15, 1999. He later recorded the work for a 2001 release on Nonesuch. Also in 1999, he released &quot;The Sweetest Punch&quot;, which featured a seven-piece jazz ensemble reworking the tunes written and recorded by Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach on &quot;Painted from Memory&quot;.

Between 2003 and 2005, Frisell acted as musical director for &quot;Century of Song,&quot; a series of concerts at the German Ruhrtriennale arts festival (produced by Lee Townsend). Frisell invited artists including Rickie Lee Jones, Elvis Costello, Petra Haden, Jenny Scheinman , Suzanne Vega, Arto Lindsay, Loudon Wainwright III, Vic Chesnutt, Van Dyke Parks, Buddy Miller, Ron Sexsmith and Chip Taylor to perform their favorite songs in new arrangements.

In 2003 Frisell&#x27;s &quot;The Intercontinentals&quot; was nominated for a Grammy award; he won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album for his album &quot;Unspeakable&quot;. His 2008 album &quot;History, Mystery&quot; was nominated for a 2009 Grammy award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group. Frisell was also a judge for the sixth annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists careers.

Frisell has united with Matt Chamberlain, Tucker Martine, and Lee Townsend in the Floratone band, and they released an album on Blue Note (2007) featuring guest performances of Viktor Krauss, Ron Miles and Eyvind Kang.

In 2008 Frisell performed as a featured guest on Earth&#x27;s album &quot;The Bees Made Honey in the Lion&#x27;s Skull&quot;. In 2009 Frisell featured in a duet rendition of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; with singer-songwriter Sam Shrieve. The recording was released on Shrieve&#x27;s debut album &quot;Bittersweet Lullabies&quot;.

In 2010 Frisell started working with the Savoy Jazz label and released &quot;Beautiful Dreamers&quot; in August 2010, then a second release of &quot;Sign of Life&quot; in April 2011. Also, on January 25, 2011, Frisell and Vinicius Cantuária released &quot;Lágrimas Mexicanas&quot; on the E1 label.

In June 2011, Frisell, Lee Townsend, and their frequent collaborator, Vinicius Cantuaria, participated in TEDx GoldenGateED&#x27;s program, &quot;Teaching Compassion&quot; in Oakland, California. Frisell and Cantuaria performed separately, and Townsend assisted with the technical aspects of the event. In September 2011, Frisell released &quot;All We Are Saying&quot;, a full-length offering of his interpretations of John Lennon&#x27;s music. Frisell&#x27;s quintet includes violinist Jenny Scheinman, pedal steel and acoustic guitarist Greg Leisz, bassist Tony Scherr, and drummer Kenny Wollesen. In 2017, Frisell received an honorary doctorate of music from his alma mater, Berklee College of Music.

In 2021 a video was recorded at the Village Vanguard in New York and was published by Blue Note Records on YouTube.

<doc id="376073" wikidata="Q6475416" url="?curid=376073" title="Lake Clifton Eastern High School">
<text>Lake Clifton Eastern High School (LCEHS) was a public high school closed in 2005, located in the Clifton Park area of northeast Baltimore, Maryland. Originally called Lake Clifton High School (LCHS), although it was commonly known as Lake High School or Lake Clifton, it is now called the Lake Clifton Campus (LCC).

Along with Walbrook and Southwestern High Schools, LCHS was constructed in 1970–71, and opened in September 1971, named after the Lake Clifton Reservoir and the Clifton Park neighborhood where it was located. Designed during the post-World War II &quot;Baby Boom&quot; years of the 1960s to relieve overcrowding in the city&#x27;s public high schools, particularly nearby Baltimore City College (City HS), the third oldest public high school in America (founded 1839), and Eastern High School (EHS). Each had about 4,000 students, twice their maximum capacity.

In 1986, with the closure of EHS, the two schools merged and LCHS was renamed Lake Clifton Eastern High School. However after the 2004–05 school year, LCEHS was also closed due to declining school enrollment. Two smaller secondary schools, Heritage High School and the REACH! Partnership School subsequently used the campus. In August 2020, the city announced that it planned to sell the property for potential redevelopment, possibly to Morgan State University.

==History==

===Early years===
A reservoir named &quot;Lake Clifton Reservoir&quot; occupied the site and was in use until the late 1960s. The reservoir was drained and became the site for the high school&#x27;s construction in 1970–71. Originally known as &quot;Lake Clifton High School&quot;. At the time it was constructed, the school&#x27;s property area of 441.11 acres (178.51 ha) made it the largest physical plant high school on the East Coast of the United States. In Lake Clifton&#x27;s 2002 yearbook, it states that LCEHS &quot;was [in the early 70s], and perhaps remains, the largest physical plant high school in the nation.&quot; The cost of constructing and equipping LCHS was approximately $17 million in 1970, which adjusting for inflation, would be approximately $99,258,764.27 in 2010. The school was designed to hold 4,800 students.

In the 1985–86 school year, Eastern High School merged with Lake Clifton High School, and the Baltimore City School Board changed the school&#x27;s name to reflect this. In 1995, the school became a pilot high school for the Sylvan Learning Center, reconfiguring its curriculum as a result. From 1995 to 2003, Lake Clifton Eastern consisted of six smaller learning communities: the School of the Academy of Finance and Law (formerly known as &quot;The Academy of Finance and Law&quot;); the School of Business and Commerce; the School of Human Services; the School of Communications and Technology; the School of Humanities and Fine and Cultural Arts; and the Ninth Grade Achievement School. The goal and mission of Lake Clifton Eastern High School was &quot;to provide an educational program relevant to the needs of all students to prepare them for college/post secondary education, or the world of work.&quot;

On Sunday, January 30, 1995, an electrical fire caused by faulty wiring destroyed the school&#x27;s original two story library, cafeteria, and administrative offices. In 1998, a one-story state-of-the-art media center and library was built to replace the fire-damaged section, at the cost of $4 million, which would be $5,344,512.24 adjusted for inflation in 2010.

===21st century===

Following an ill-timed attempt to close the school during the middle of the 2001–2002 academic year, the city school board decided to downsize LCEHS into a smaller school after the graduation of the Class of 2005. With support from the Small Schools Workshop, school faculty members and administrators met and planned new, small, learning communities to open within Lake Clifton. However, the board changed plans and decided on new uses for the campus, dividing the school population to other schools. As a result, in 2005, Lake Clifton Eastern High School ceased to exist, its campus converting into two separate, smaller schools: Heritage High School and Doris M. Johnson High School. A third school, City Springs Elementary/Middle Alternative Charter School was temporarily on the campus before moving to the Belair-Edison neighborhood. The Lake Clifton Campus was then occupied by the Heritage High School and the REACH! Partnership School, which moved onto the campus in 2007, and expanded after the closure of the Doris M. Johnson High School in 2011. Faced with continuing population decline and shrinking school enrollment, the city announced plans in August 2020, to sell the property for potential redevelopment, possibly to Morgan State University.

===Crime===

Discipline problems, high dropout rates, violence, low test scores and low attendance had plagued the school for decades. Shooting incidents occurred on the campus on January 5, 1984, a fatal shooting on October 8, 1985, a fatal shooting on January 29, 1986 and a fatal shooting resulting in the death of a high school student occurred on January 17, 2001.

==Extracurricular activities==

===Athletics===
From 1971 through the early 1990s, there were several sports such as tennis, badminton and swimming &amp; diving, all of which were terminated. During the 2002–03 school year, the last year of the school&#x27;s existence, Lake Clifton only had 7 athletic activities. The athletic teams won several state and/or city championships:

*Swimming — State championship: 1993
*Tennis — State championship: 1991, 1992
*Football — State championship: 1990, 1999
*Boys&#x27; basketball — Baltimore City (District 9): 1993, 2003; State championship: 1995, 2003

==Layout and site==

===Building layout===
The building has a central core containing main offices, a 1,000-seat auditorium, two cafeterias, two gymnasiums, a swimming pool, main library &amp; media center, and other administrative offices. This core is connected by bridges and passageways to two buildings, each containing a common area radiating to two distinct smaller units housing classrooms on four levels. The units are referred to as A, B, C, and D units; A and B units are connected on the left side of the central core and C and D units on the right side. After the closure of LCEHS, as of 2010, Heritage High School utilizes the A &amp; B unit side, and the REACH! Partnership School utilizes the C &amp; D side of the campus (formerly used by Doris M. Johnson High School).

===Outside area===

The Lake Clifton Campus includes an athletic sports field, a track and field area, and a tennis area which can also be used for badminton. Additionally, there is a 6-acre (2.4 ha) sustainable agriculture urban farm, &quot;Real Food Farm&quot;, which is managed by Civic Works, Inc. The farm has several &quot;hoop houses&quot;, tunnel-greenhouses, that were created in 2009 in order to increase food access in local neighborhoods, as well as demonstrating the economic potential of agriculture and environmental urban farming and providing educational opportunities.

<doc id="376083" wikidata="Q472699" url="?curid=376083" title="Nullification crisis">
<text>The nullification crisis was a sectional political crisis in the United States in 1832 and 1833, during the presidency of Andrew Jackson, which involved a confrontation between the state of South Carolina and the federal government. It ensued after South Carolina declared the federal Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and therefore null and void within the sovereign boundaries of the state. 

The controversial and highly protective Tariff of 1828 was enacted into law during the presidency of John Quincy Adams. The tariff was strongly opposed in the South, since it was perceived to put an unfair tax burden on the Southern agrarian states that imported most manufactured goods. The tariff&#x27;s opponents expected that Jackson&#x27;s election as president would result in its significant reduction. When the Jackson administration failed to take any action to address their concerns, South Carolina&#x27;s most radical faction began to advocate that the state nullify the tariff. They subscribed to the legal theory that if a state believed a federal law unconstitutional, it could declare the law null and void in the state. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between Jackson and Vice President John C. Calhoun, a native South Carolinian and the most effective proponent of the constitutional theory of state nullification.

On July 1, 1832, before Calhoun resigned the vice presidency to run for the Senate, where he could more effectively defend nullification, Jackson signed into law the Tariff of 1832. This compromise tariff received the support of most Northerners and half the Southerners in Congress. South Carolina remained unsatisfied, and on November 24, 1832, a state convention adopted the Ordinance of Nullification, which declared that the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and unenforceable in South Carolina after February 1, 1833. South Carolina initiated military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement, but on March 1, 1833, Congress passed both the Force Bill—authorizing the president to use military forces against South Carolina—and a new negotiated tariff, the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which was satisfactory to South Carolina. The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance on March 15, 1833, but three days later, nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture of principle.

The crisis was over, and both sides found reasons to claim victory. The tariff rates were reduced and stayed low to the satisfaction of the South, but the states&#x27; rights doctrine of nullification remained controversial. By the 1850s, the issues of the expansion of slavery into the western territories and the threat of the Slave Power became the central issues in the nation.

==Background (1787–1816)==
The historian Richard E. Ellis wrote:

The extent of this change and the problem of the actual distribution of powers between state and the federal governments would be a matter of political and ideological discussion through the Civil War as well as afterwards. In the early 1790s the debate centered on Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s nationalistic financial program versus Jefferson&#x27;s democratic and agrarian program, a conflict that led to the formation of two opposing national political parties. Later in the decade the Alien and Sedition Acts led to the states&#x27; rights position being articulated in the &quot;Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions&quot;. The Kentucky Resolutions, written by Thomas Jefferson, contained the following, which has often been cited as a justification for both nullification and secession:

The Virginia Resolutions, written by James Madison, hold a similar argument:

Historians differ over the extent to which either resolution advocated the doctrine of nullification. Historian Lance Banning wrote, &quot;The legislators of Kentucky (or more likely, John Breckinridge, the Kentucky legislator who sponsored the resolution) deleted Jefferson&#x27;s suggestion that the rightful remedy for federal usurpation was a &quot;nullification&quot; of such acts by each state acting on its own to prevent their operation within its respective borders. Rather than suggesting individual, although concerted, measures of this sort, Kentucky was content to ask its sisters to unite in declarations that the acts were &quot;void and of no force&quot;, and in &quot;requesting their appeal&quot; at the succeeding session of the Congress.&quot; The key sentence, and the word &quot;nullification&quot; was used in supplementary Resolutions passed by Kentucky in 1799.

Madison&#x27;s judgment is clearer. He was chairman of a committee of the Virginia Legislature, which issued a book-length &quot;Report on the Resolutions of 1798&quot;, published in 1800 after they had been decried by several states. This asserted that the state did not claim legal force. &quot;The declarations in such cases are expressions of opinion, unaccompanied by other effect than what they may produce upon opinion, by exciting reflection. The opinions of the judiciary, on the other hand, are carried into immediate effect by force.&quot; If the states collectively agreed in their declarations, there were several methods by which it might prevail, from persuading Congress to repeal the unconstitutional law, to calling a constitutional convention, as two-thirds of the states may. When, at the time of the nullification crisis, he was presented with the Kentucky resolutions of 1799, he argued that the resolutions themselves were not Jefferson&#x27;s words, and that Jefferson meant this not as a constitutional, but as a revolutionary right.

Madison biographer Ralph Ketcham wrote:

Historian Sean Wilentz explains the widespread opposition to these resolutions:


The election of 1800 was a turning point in national politics, as the Federalists were replaced by the Democratic-Republican Party led by Jefferson, but the four presidential terms spanning the period from 1800 to 1817 &quot;did little to advance the cause of states&#x27; rights and much to weaken it.&quot; Over Jefferson&#x27;s opposition, the power of the federal judiciary, led by Federalist Chief Justice John Marshall, increased. Jefferson expanded federal powers with the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory and his use of a national embargo designed to prevent involvement in a European war. Madison in 1809 used national troops to enforce a Supreme Court decision in Pennsylvania, appointed an &quot;extreme nationalist&quot; in Joseph Story to the Supreme Court, signed the bill creating the Second Bank of the United States, and called for a constitutional amendment to promote internal improvements.

Opposition to the War of 1812 was centered in New England. Delegates to a convention in Hartford, Connecticut, met in December 1814 to consider a New England response to Madison&#x27;s war policy. The debate allowed many radicals to argue the cause of states&#x27; rights and state sovereignty. In the end, moderate voices dominated and the final product was not secession or nullification, but a series of proposed constitutional amendments. Identifying the South&#x27;s domination of the government as the cause of much of their problems, the proposed amendments included &quot;the repeal of the three-fifths clause, a requirement that two-thirds of both houses of Congress agree before any new state could be admitted to the Union, limits on the length of embargoes, and the outlawing of the election of a president from the same state to successive terms, clearly aimed at the Virginians.&quot; The war was over before the proposals were submitted to President Madison.

After the conclusion of the War of 1812 Sean Wilentz notes:

This spirit of nationalism was linked to the tremendous growth and economic prosperity of this postwar era. However in 1819, the nation suffered its first financial panic and the 1820s turned out to be a decade of political turmoil that again led to fierce debates over competing views of the exact nature of American federalism. The &quot;extreme democratic and agrarian rhetoric&quot; that had been so effective in 1798 led to renewed attacks on the &quot;numerous market-oriented enterprises, particularly banks, corporations, creditors, and absentee landholders&quot;.

==Tariffs (1816–1828)==
The Tariff of 1816 had some protective features, and it received support throughout the nation, including that of John C. Calhoun and fellow South Carolinian William Lowndes. The first explicitly protective tariff linked to a specific program of internal improvements was the Tariff of 1824. Sponsored by Henry Clay, this tariff provided a general level of protection at 35% ad valorem (compared to 25% with the 1816 act) and hiked duties on iron, woolens, cotton, hemp, and wool and cotton bagging. The bill barely passed the federal House of Representatives by a vote of 107 to 102. The Middle states and Northwest supported the bill, the South and Southwest opposed it, and New England split its vote with a majority opposing it. In the Senate, the bill, with the support of Tennessee Senator Andrew Jackson, passed by four votes, and President James Monroe, the Virginia heir to the Jefferson-Madison control of the White House, signed the bill on March 25, 1824. Daniel Webster of Massachusetts led the New England opposition to this tariff.

Protest against the prospect and the constitutionality of higher tariffs began in 1826 and 1827 with William Branch Giles, who had the Virginia legislature pass resolutions denying the power of Congress to pass protective tariffs, citing the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 and James Madison&#x27;s 1800 defense of them. Madison denied both the appeal to nullification and the unconstitutionality; he had always held that the power to regulate commerce included protection. Jefferson had, at the end of his life, written against protective tariffs.
The Tariff of 1828 was largely the work of Martin Van Buren (although Silas Wright Jr. of New York prepared the main provisions) and was partly a political ploy to elect Andrew Jackson President. Van Buren calculated that the South would vote for Jackson regardless of the issues, so he ignored their interests in drafting the bill. New England, he thought, was just as likely to support the incumbent John Quincy Adams, so the bill levied heavy taxes on raw materials consumed by New England such as hemp, flax, molasses, iron, and sail duck. With an additional tariff on iron to satisfy Pennsylvania interests, Van Buren expected the tariff to help deliver Pennsylvania, New York, Missouri, Ohio, and Kentucky to Jackson. Over opposition from the South and some from New England, the tariff was passed with the full support of many Jackson supporters in Congress and signed by President Adams in early 1828.

As expected, Jackson and his running mate John Calhoun carried the entire South with overwhelming numbers in every state but Louisiana, where Adams drew 47% of the vote in a losing effort. But many Southerners became dissatisfied as Jackson, in his first two annual messages to Congress, failed to launch a strong attack on the tariff. Historian William J. Cooper Jr. writes:

==South Carolina background (1819–1828)==
South Carolina had been adversely affected by the national economic decline of the 1820s. During this decade, the population decreased by 56,000 whites and 30,000 slaves, out of a total free and slave population of 580,000. The whites left for better places; they took slaves with them or sold them to traders moving slaves to the Deep South for sale.

Historian Richard E. Ellis describes the situation:

State leaders, led by states&#x27; rights advocates such as William Smith and Thomas Cooper, blamed most of the state&#x27;s economic problems on the Tariff of 1816 and national internal improvement projects. Soil erosion and competition from the New Southwest were also very significant reasons for the state&#x27;s declining fortunes. George McDuffie was a particularly effective speaker for the anti-tariff forces, and he popularized the Forty Bale theory. McDuffie argued that the 40% tariff on cotton finished goods meant that &quot;the manufacturer actually invades your barns, and plunders you of 40 out of every 100 bales that you produce.&quot; Mathematically incorrect, this argument still struck a nerve with his constituency. Nationalists such as Calhoun were forced by the increasing power of such leaders to retreat from their previous positions and adopt, in the words of Ellis, &quot;an even more extreme version of the states&#x27; rights doctrine&quot; in order to maintain political significance within South Carolina.

South Carolina&#x27;s first effort at nullification occurred in 1822. Its planter class believed that free black sailors had assisted Denmark Vesey in his planned slave rebellion. South Carolina passed the Negro Seamen Act, which required all black foreign seamen to be imprisoned while their ships were docked in Charleston. The United Kingdom strongly objected, especially as it was recruiting more Africans as sailors. Worse, if the captains did not pay the fees to cover the cost of jailing, South Carolina would sell the sailors into slavery. Other Southern states also passed laws against free black sailors.

Supreme Court Justice William Johnson, in his capacity as a circuit judge, declared the South Carolina law as unconstitutional since it violated the United States&#x27; treaties with the United Kingdom. The South Carolina Senate announced that the judge&#x27;s ruling was invalid and that the act would be enforced. The federal government did not attempt to carry out Johnson&#x27;s decision.

==Route to nullification in South Carolina (1828–1832)==
Historian Avery Craven argues that, for the most part, the debate from 1828 to 1832 was a local South Carolina affair. The state&#x27;s leaders were not united and the sides were roughly equal. The western part of the state and a faction in Charleston, led by Joel Poinsett and Thomas Smith Grimké, remained loyal to the Union. Only in small part was the conflict between &quot;a National North against a States&#x27;-right South&quot;.

After the final vote on the Tariff of 1828, South Carolina&#x27;s congressional delegation held two caucuses, the second at the home of Senator Robert Y. Hayne. They were rebuffed in their efforts to coordinate a united Southern response and focused on how their state representatives would react. While many agreed with McDuffie that tariff policy could lead to secession, they all agreed that, as much as possible, the issue should be kept out of the upcoming presidential election. Calhoun, while not at this meeting, served as a moderating influence. He felt that the first step in reducing the tariff was to defeat Adams and his supporters in the upcoming election. William C. Preston, on behalf of the South Carolina legislature, asked Calhoun to prepare a report on the tariff situation. Calhoun readily accepted and in a few weeks had a 35,000-word draft of what would become his &quot;Exposition and Protest&quot;.

Calhoun&#x27;s &quot;Exposition&quot; was completed late in 1828. He argued that the tariff of 1828 was unconstitutional because it favored manufacturing over commerce and agriculture. He believed the tariff power could be used only to generate revenue, not to provide protection from foreign competition for American industries, and that the people of a state or several states, acting in a democratically elected convention, had the power to veto any act of the federal government that violated the Constitution. This veto, the core of the doctrine of nullification, was explained by Calhoun in the Exposition:

The report also detailed the specific southern grievances over the tariff that led to the current dissatisfaction. Fearful that &quot;hotheads&quot; such as McDuffie might force the legislature into taking drastic action against the federal government, historian John Niven describes Calhoun&#x27;s political purpose in the document:

The report was submitted to the state legislature, which had 5,000 copies printed and distributed. Calhoun, who still had designs on succeeding Jackson as president, was not identified as the author, but word on this soon leaked out. The legislature took no action on the report at that time.

In the summer of 1828, Robert Barnwell Rhett, soon to be considered the most radical of the South Carolinians, entered the fray over the tariff. As a state representative, Rhett called for the governor to convene a special session of the legislature. An outstanding orator, Rhett appealed to his constituents to resist the majority in Congress. He addressed the danger of doing nothing:

Rhett&#x27;s rhetoric about revolution and war was too radical in the summer of 1828 but, with the election of Jackson assured, James Hamilton Jr. on October 28 in the Colleton County Courthouse in Walterborough &quot;launched the formal nullification campaign.&quot; Renouncing his former nationalism, Hamilton warned the people that &quot;Your task-master must soon become a tyrant, from the very abuses and corruption of the system, without the bowels of compassion, or a jot of human sympathy.&quot; He called for implementation of Jefferson&#x27;s &quot;rightful remedy&quot; of nullification. Hamilton sent a copy of the speech directly to President-elect Jackson. But despite a statewide campaign by Hamilton and McDuffie, a proposal to call a nullification convention in 1829 was defeated by the South Carolina legislature meeting at the end of 1828. State leaders such as Calhoun, Hayne, Smith, and William Drayton all remained publicly noncommittal or opposed to nullification for the next couple of years.

The division in the state between radicals and conservatives continued through 1829 and 1830. After the failure of a state project to arrange financing of a railroad within the state to promote internal trade, the state petitioned Congress to invest $250,000 in the company trying to build it. After Congress tabled the measure, debate in South Carolina resumed between those who wanted state investment and those who wanted to work to get Congress&#x27;s support. The debate demonstrated that a significant minority of the state did have an interest in Clay&#x27;s American System. The effect of the Webster–Hayne debate was to energize the radicals, and some moderates started to move in their direction.

The state election campaign of 1830 focused on the tariff issue and the need for a state convention. On the defensive, radicals underplayed the intent of the convention as pro-nullification. When voters were presented with races where an unpledged convention was the issue, the radicals generally won. When conservatives effectively characterized the race as being about nullification, the radicals lost. The October election was narrowly carried by the radicals, although the blurring of the issues left them without any specific mandate. In South Carolina, the governor was selected by the legislature, which chose James Hamilton, the leader of the radical movement, and fellow radical Henry L. Pinckney as speaker of the South Carolina House. For the open Senate seat, the legislature chose the more radical Stephen Decatur Miller over William Smith.

With radicals in leading positions, in 1831 they began to capture momentum. State politics became sharply divided along Nullifier and Unionist lines. Still, the margin in the legislature fell short of the two-thirds majority needed for a convention. Many of the radicals felt that convincing Calhoun of the futility of his plans for the presidency would lead him into their ranks. Calhoun, meanwhile, had concluded that Van Buren was establishing himself as Jackson&#x27;s heir apparent. At Hamilton&#x27;s prompting, McDuffie made a three-hour speech in Charleston demanding nullification of the tariff at any cost. In the state, the success of McDuffie&#x27;s speech seemed to open up the possibilities of both military confrontation with the federal government and civil war within the state. With silence no longer an acceptable alternative, Calhoun looked for the opportunity to take control of the antitariff faction in the state; by June he was preparing what would be known as his Fort Hill Address.

Published on July 26, 1831, the address repeated and expanded the positions Calhoun had made in the &quot;Exposition&quot;. While the logic of much of the speech was consistent with the states&#x27; rights position of most Jacksonians, and even Daniel Webster remarked that it &quot;was the ablest and most plausible, and therefore the most dangerous vindication of that particular form of Revolution&quot;, the speech still placed Calhoun clearly in a nullified camp. Within South Carolina, his gestures at moderation in the speech were drowned out as planters received word of the Nat Turner insurrection in Virginia. Calhoun was not alone in finding a connection between the abolition movement and the sectional aspects of the tariff issue. It confirmed for Calhoun what he had written in a September 11, 1830, letter:

I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.

From this point, the nullifiers accelerated their organization and rhetoric. In July 1831, the States Rights and Free Trade Association was formed in Charleston and expanded throughout the state. Unlike state political organizations in the past, which were led by the South Carolina planter aristocracy, this group appealed to all segments of the population, including non-slaveholder farmers, small slaveholders, and the Charleston non-agricultural class. Governor Hamilton was instrumental in seeing that the association, which was both a political and a social organization, expanded throughout the state. In the winter of 1831 and spring of 1832, Hamilton held conventions and rallies throughout the state to mobilize the nullification movement. The conservatives were unable to match the radicals in organization or leadership.

The state elections of 1832 were &quot;charged with tension and bespattered with violence,&quot; and &quot;polite debates often degenerated into frontier brawls.&quot; Unlike the previous year&#x27;s election, the choice was clear between nullifiers and unionists. The nullifiers won and on October 20, 1832, Hamilton called the legislature into a special session to consider a convention. The legislative vote was 96–25 in the House and 31–13 in the Senate.

In November 1832, the Nullification Convention met. The convention declared the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and unenforceable within the state of South Carolina after February 1, 1833. It was asserted that attempts to use force to collect the taxes would lead to the state&#x27;s secession. Robert Hayne, who succeeded Hamilton as governor in 1833, established a 2,000-man group of mounted minutemen and 25,000 infantry who would march to Charleston in the event of a military conflict. These troops were to be armed with $100,000 in arms purchased in the North.

The enabling legislation passed by the legislature was carefully constructed to avoid clashes if at all possible and create an aura of legality in the process. To avoid conflicts with Unionists, it allowed importers to pay the tariff if they desired. Other merchants could pay the tariff by obtaining a paper tariff bond from the customs officer. They would then refuse to pay the bond when due, and if the customs official seized the goods, the merchant would file for a writ of replevin to recover the goods in state court. Customs officials who refused to return the goods (by placing them under the protection of federal troops) would be civilly liable for twice the value of the goods. To ensure that state officials and judges supported the law, a &quot;test oath&quot; would be required for all new state officials, binding them to support the ordinance of nullification.

Governor Hayne in his inaugural address announced South Carolina&#x27;s position:

==Washington, D.C. (1828–1832)==
When President Jackson took office in March 1829, he was well aware of the turmoil created by the &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot;. While he may have abandoned some of his earlier beliefs that had allowed him to vote for the Tariff of 1824, he still felt protectionism was justified for products essential to military preparedness and did not believe that the current tariff should be reduced until the national debt was fully paid off. He addressed the issue in his inaugural address and his first three messages to Congress, but offered no specific relief. In December 1831, with the proponents of nullification in South Carolina gaining momentum, Jackson recommended &quot;the exercise of that spirit of concession and conciliation which has distinguished the friends of our Union in all great emergencies.&quot; But on the constitutional issue of nullification, despite his strong beliefs in states&#x27; rights, Jackson did not waver.

Calhoun&#x27;s &quot;Exposition and Protest&quot; started a national debate on the doctrine of nullification. The leading proponents of the nationalistic view included Daniel Webster, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, Judge William Alexander Duer, John Quincy Adams, Nathaniel Chipman, and Nathan Dane. They rejected the compact theory advanced by Calhoun, claiming that the Constitution was the product of the people, not the states. According to the nationalist position, the Supreme Court had the final say on legislation&#x27;s constitutionality, and the national union was perpetual and had supreme authority over individual states. The nullifiers, on the other hand, asserted that the central government was not the ultimate arbiter of its own power, and that the states, as the contracting entities, could judge for themselves what was constitutional. While Calhoun&#x27;s &quot;Exposition&quot; claimed that nullification was based on the reasoning behind the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, an aging James Madison in an August 28, 1830, letter to Edward Everett, intended for publication, disagreed. Madison wrote, denying that any individual state could alter the compact:

Part of the South&#x27;s strategy to force repeal of the tariff was to arrange an alliance with the West. Under the plan, the South would support the West&#x27;s demand for free lands in the public domain if the West supported repeal of the tariff. With this purpose, Robert Hayne took the floor on the Senate in early 1830, beginning &quot;the most celebrated debate in the Senate&#x27;s history.&quot; Daniel Webster&#x27;s response shifted the debate, subsequently styled the Webster-Hayne debates, from the specific issue of western lands to a general debate on the very nature of the United States. Webster&#x27;s position differed from Madison&#x27;s: Webster asserted that the people of the United States acted as one aggregate body, while Madison held that the people of the several states acted collectively. John Rowan spoke against Webster on that issue, and Madison wrote, congratulating Webster, but explaining his own position. The debate presented the fullest articulation of the differences over nullification, and 40,000 copies of Webster&#x27;s response, which concluded with &quot;liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable&quot;, were distributed nationwide.

Many people expected Jackson to side with Hayne, but once the debate shifted to secession and nullification, he sided with Webster. On April 13, 1830, at the traditional Democratic Party celebration honoring Jefferson&#x27;s birthday, Jackson chose to make his position clear. In a battle of toasts, Hayne proposed, &quot;The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s response, when his turn came, was, &quot;Our Federal Union: It must be preserved.&quot; To those attending, the effect was dramatic. Calhoun responded with his own toast, in a play on Webster&#x27;s closing remarks in the earlier debate, &quot;The Union. Next to our liberty, the most dear.&quot; Finally, Van Buren offered, &quot;Mutual forbearance and reciprocal concession. Through their agency the Union was established. The patriotic spirit from which they emanated will forever sustain it.&quot;

Van Buren wrote in his autobiography of Jackson&#x27;s toast, &quot;The veil was rent—the incantations of the night were exposed to the light of day.&quot; Senator Thomas Hart Benton, in his memoirs, wrote that the toast &quot;electrified the country.&quot; Jackson had the final word a few days later, when a visitor from South Carolina asked if Jackson had any message he wanted relayed to his friends back in the state. Jackson&#x27;s reply was:

Other issues than the tariff were still being decided. In May 1830, Jackson vetoed the Maysville Road Bill, an important internal-improvements program (especially to Kentucky and Henry Clay), and then followed this with additional vetoes of other such projects shortly before Congress adjourned at the end of May. Clay used these vetoes to launch his presidential campaign. In 1831, the rechartering of the Bank of the United States, with Clay and Jackson on opposite sides, reopened a long-simmering problem. This issue was featured at the December 1831 National Republican convention in Baltimore, which nominated Clay for president, and the proposal to recharter was formally introduced into Congress on January 6, 1832. The Calhoun-Jackson split entered the center stage when Calhoun, as vice president presiding over the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote to deny Van Buren the post of minister to England. Van Buren was subsequently selected as Jackson&#x27;s running mate at the 1832 Democratic National Convention held in May.

In February 1832, Clay, back in the Senate after a two-decade absence, made a three-day speech calling for a new tariff schedule and an expansion of his American System. In an effort to reach out to Calhoun and other Southerners, Clay&#x27;s proposal provided for a $10 million revenue reduction based on the budget surplus he anticipated for the coming year. Significant protection was still part of the plan, as the reduction primarily came on imports not in competition with domestic producers. Jackson proposed an alternative that reduced overall tariffs to 28%. John Quincy Adams, now in the House of Representatives, used his Committee of Manufacturers to produce a compromise bill that, in its final form, reduced revenues by $5 million, lowered duties on noncompetitive products, and retained high tariffs on woolens, iron, and cotton products. During the political maneuvering, McDuffie&#x27;s Ways and Means Committee, the normal originator of such bills, prepared a bill with drastic reduction across the board, but it went nowhere. Jackson signed the Tariff of 1832 on July 14, 1832, a few days after vetoing the Bank of the United States recharter bill. Congress adjourned after failing to override Jackson&#x27;s veto.

With Congress adjourned, Jackson anxiously watched events in South Carolina. The nullifiers found no significant compromise in the Tariff of 1832 and acted accordingly. Jackson heard rumors of efforts to subvert members of the army and navy in Charleston and ordered the secretaries of the army and navy to begin rotating troops and officers based on their loyalty. He ordered General Winfield Scott to prepare for military operations and ordered a naval squadron in Norfolk to prepare to go to Charleston. Jackson kept lines of communication open with unionists such as Joel Poinsett, William Drayton, and James L. Petigru and sent George Breathitt, brother of the Kentucky governor, to independently obtain political and military intelligence. After their defeat at the polls in October, Petigru advised Jackson to &quot;Be prepared to hear very shortly of a State Convention and an act of Nullification.&quot;

On October 29, 1832, Jackson wrote to his Secretary of War, Lewis Cass:

By mid-November, Jackson&#x27;s reelection was assured. On December 3, 1832, Jackson sent his fourth annual message to Congress. The message &quot;was stridently states&#x27; rights and agrarian in its tone and thrust&quot; and disavowed protection as anything other than a temporary expedient. His intent regarding nullification, as communicated to Van Buren, was &quot;to pass it barely in review, as a mere buble , view the existing laws as competent to check and put it down.&quot; He hoped to create a &quot;moral force&quot; that would transcend political parties and sections. The paragraph in the message that addressed nullification was:

On December 10, Jackson issued the Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, in which he characterized the positions of the nullifiers as &quot;impractical absurdity&quot; and &quot;a metaphysical subtlety, in pursuit of an impractical theory.&quot; He provided this concise statement of his belief:

The language Jackson used, combined with the reports out of South Carolina, raised the spectre of military confrontation for many on both sides of the issue. A group of Democrats, led by Van Buren and Thomas Hart Benton, among others, saw the only solution to the crisis in a substantial reduction of the tariff.

==Negotiation and confrontation (1833)==
In apparent contradiction of his previous claim that the tariff could be enforced with existing laws, on January 16 Jackson sent his Force Bill Message to Congress. Custom houses in Beaufort and Georgetown would be closed and replaced by ships at each port. In Charleston, the custom house would be moved to either Castle Pinckney or Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor. Direct payment rather than bonds would be required, and federal jails would be established for violators the state refused to arrest and all cases arising under the state&#x27;s nullification act could be removed to the United States Circuit Court. In the most controversial part, the militia acts of 1795 and 1807 would be revised to permit the enforcement of the customs laws by both the militia and the regular United States military. Attempts were made in South Carolina to shift the debate away from nullification by focusing instead on the proposed enforcement.

The Force bill went to the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania protectionist William Wilkins and supported by members Daniel Webster and Theodore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey; it gave Jackson everything he asked. On January 28, the Senate defeated a motion by a vote of 30 to 15 to postpone debate on the bill. All but two of the votes to delay were from the lower South and only three from this section voted against the motion. This did not signal any increased support for nullification, but did signify doubts about enforcement. To draw more votes, proposals were made to limit the duration of the coercive powers and restrict the use of force to suppressing, rather than preventing, civil disorder. In the House, the Judiciary Committee voted 4–3 to reject Jackson&#x27;s request to use force. By the time Calhoun made a major speech on February 15 strongly opposing it, the Force Bill was temporarily stalled.

On the tariff issue, the drafting of a compromise tariff was assigned in December to the House Ways and Means Committee, now headed by Gulian C. Verplanck. Debate on the committee&#x27;s product on the House floor began in January 1833. The Verplanck tariff proposed reductions back to 1816 levels over the next two years while maintaining the basic principle of protectionism. The anti-Jackson protectionists saw this as an economic disaster that did not even allow the Tariff of 1832 to be tested and &quot;an undignified truckling to the menaces and blustering of South Carolina.&quot; Northern Democrats did not oppose it in principle, but still demanded protection for the varying interests of their own constituents. Those sympathetic to the nullifiers wanted a specific abandonment of the principle of protectionism and were willing to offer a longer transition period as a bargaining point. The Verplanck tariff was clearly not going to be implemented.

In South Carolina, efforts were being made to avoid an unnecessary confrontation. Governor Hayne ordered the 25,000 troops he had created to train at home rather than gather in Charleston. At a mass meeting in Charleston on January 21, they decided to postpone the February 1 deadline for implementing nullification, while Congress worked on a compromise tariff. At the same time, a commissioner from Virginia, Benjamin W. Leigh, arrived in Charleston bearing resolutions that criticized both Jackson and the nullifiers and offering his state as a mediator.

Clay had not taken his defeat in the presidential election well and was unsure what position he could take in the tariff negotiations. His long-term concern was that Jackson was determined to kill protectionism along with the American Plan. In February, after consulting with manufacturers and sugar interests in Louisiana, who favored protection for the sugar industry, Clay started to work on a specific compromise plan. As a starting point, he accepted the nullifiers&#x27; offer of a transition period, but extended it from seven and a half years to nine years with a final target of a 20% &quot;ad valorem&quot; rate. After first securing the support of his protectionist base, Clay, through an intermediary, broached the subject with Calhoun. Calhoun was receptive, and after a private meeting with Clay at Clay&#x27;s boardinghouse, negotiations proceeded.

Clay introduced the negotiated tariff bill on February 12, and it was immediately referred to a select committee consisting of Clay as chairman, Felix Grundy of Tennessee, George M. Dallas of Pennsylvania, William Cabell Rives of Virginia, Webster, John M. Clayton of Delaware, and Calhoun. On February 21, the committee reported a bill to the floor of the Senate that was largely Clay&#x27;s original bill. The Tariff of 1832 would continue except that reduction of all rates above 20% would be reduced by one tenth every two years, with the final reductions back to 20% coming in 1842. Protectionism as a principle was not abandoned and provisions were made for raising the tariff if national interests demanded it.

Although not specifically linked by any negotiated agreement, it became clear that the Force Bill and Compromise Tariff of 1833 were inexorably linked. In his February 25 speech ending the debate on the tariff, Clay captured the spirit of the voices for compromise by condemning Jackson&#x27;s Proclamation to South Carolina as inflammatory, admitting the same problem with the Force Bill, but indicating its necessity, and praising the Compromise Tariff as the final measure to restore balance, promote the rule of law, and avoid the &quot;sacked cities&quot;, &quot;desolated fields&quot;, and &quot;smoking ruins&quot; he said the failure to reach a final accord would produce. The House passed the Compromise Tariff, 119–85, and the Force Bill, 149–48. In the Senate, the tariff passed 29–16 and the Force bill 32–1, with many opponents of it walking out rather than voting.

Calhoun rushed to Charleston with the news of the final compromises. The Nullification Convention met again on March 11. It repealed the November Nullification Ordinance and also, &quot;in a purely symbolic gesture&quot;, nullified the Force Bill. While the nullifiers claimed victory on the tariff issue, even though they had made concessions, the verdict was very different on nullification. The majority had in the end ruled and this boded ill for the South and its minority&#x27;s hold on slavery. Rhett summed this up at the convention on March 13. Warning that &quot;A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands,&quot; he continued:

==Aftermath==
People reflected on the meaning of the nullification crisis and its outcome for the country. On May 1, 1833, Jackson predicted, &quot;the tariff was only a pretext, and disunion and Southern confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question.&quot;

The final resolution of the crisis and Jackson&#x27;s leadership had appeal throughout the North and South. Robert V. Remini, the historian and Jackson biographer, described the opposition that nullification drew from traditionally states&#x27; rights Southern states:

The historian Forrest McDonald, describing the split over nullification among proponents of states&#x27; rights, wrote, &quot;The doctrine of states&#x27; rights, as embraced by most Americans, was not concerned exclusively, or even primarily, with state resistance to federal authority.&quot; But by the end of the nullification crisis, many Southerners questioned whether Jacksonian Democrats still represented Southern interests. The historian William J. Cooper Jr. notes, &quot;Numerous Southerners had begun to perceive it [the Jacksonian Democratic Party] as a spear aimed at the South rather than a shield defending the South.&quot;

In the political vacuum created by this alienation, the Southern wing of the Whig Party was formed. The party was a coalition of interests united by the common thread of opposition to Jackson, and more specifically to his &quot;definition of federal and executive power.&quot; The party included former National Republicans with an &quot;urban, commercial, and nationalist outlook&quot;, as well as former nullifiers. Emphasizing that &quot;they were more southern than the Democrats,&quot; the party grew within the South by going &quot;after the abolition issue with unabashed vigor and glee.&quot; With both parties arguing who could best defend Southern institutions, the nuances of the differences between free soil and abolitionism, which became an issue in the late 1840s with the Mexican War and territorial expansion, never became part of the political dialogue. This failure increased the slavery issue&#x27;s volatility.

Richard Ellis argues that the end of the crisis signified the beginning of a new era. Within the states&#x27; rights movement, the traditional desire for &quot;a weak, inactive, and frugal government&quot; was challenged. Ellis writes, &quot;in the years leading up to the Civil War the nullifiers and their proslavery allies used the doctrine of states&#x27; rights and state sovereignty in such a way as to try to expand the powers of the federal government so that it could more effectively protect the peculiar institution.&quot; By the 1850s, states&#x27; rights had become a call for state equality under the Constitution.

Madison reacted to this incipient tendency by writing two paragraphs of &quot;Advice to My Country&quot;, found among his papers. It said that the Union &quot;should be cherished and perpetuated. Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened; and the disguised one, as the Serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into paradise.&quot; Richard Rush published this &quot;Advice&quot; in 1850, by which time Southern spirit was so high that it was denounced as a forgery.

The first test for the South over slavery began during the final congressional session of 1835. In what became known as the Gag Rule Debates, abolitionists flooded Congress with petitions to end slavery in the District of Columbia, where states&#x27; rights was not an issue. The debate was reopened each session as Southerners, led by South Carolinians Henry Pinckney and John Hammond, prevented the petitions from even being officially received by Congress. Led by John Quincy Adams, the slavery debate remained on the national stage until late 1844, when Congress lifted all restrictions on processing the petitions.

Describing the legacy of the crisis, Sean Wilentz writes:

For South Carolina, the legacy of the crisis involved both the divisions within the state during the crisis and the apparent isolation of the state as the crisis was resolved. By 1860, when it became the first state to secede, it was more internally united than any other Southern state. Historian Charles Edward Cauthen writes:

<doc id="376094" wikidata="Q1048585" url="?curid=376094" title="Aglet">
<text>An aglet ( ) or aiglet is a small sheath, often made of plastic or metal, attached at each end of a shoelace, a cord, or a drawstring. An aglet keeps the fibers of the lace or cord from unraveling; its firmness and narrow profile make it easier to hold and easier to feed through eyelets, lugs, or other lacing guides.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;aglet&quot; and its variant &quot;aiglet&quot; come from the Middle French and Old French word &#x27;, the diminutive of &#x27;, meaning &quot;needle, pin&quot;, which in turn comes from the Late Latin &quot;&quot; (&quot;ornamental pin, pine needle&quot;), diminutive of &quot;acus&quot;, the Latin word for a needle or pin.

==History==
Aglets were originally made of metal, glass, or stone, and many were very ornamental. Wealthy people in the Roman era would have their aglets made out of precious metals such as brass or silver. 

Before the invention of buttons, they were used on the ends of the ribbons used to fasten clothing together. Sometimes they were formed into small figures. Shakespeare calls this type of figure an &quot;aglet baby&quot; in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;.

According to &quot;Huffington Post&quot; editor James Cave, &quot;The history of the aglet&#x27;s evolution is a little knotty—many sources credit it as being popularized by an English inventor named Harvey Kennedy who is said to have earned $2.5 million off the modern shoelace in the 1790s.&quot;

Today, the clear plastic aglets on the end of shoelaces are put there by special machines. The machines wrap plastic tape around the end of new shoelaces and use heat or chemicals to melt the plastic onto the shoelace and bond the plastic to itself.

==Variety==
There is a subtle distinction between aglets, which are generally functional, and aiguillettes, which are generally decorative. Aiguillettes usually appear at the end of decorative cords, such as bolo ties and the cords on military dress uniforms. 

Shoe companies often produce their own shoelaces, for which they manufacture aglets. Many companies prefer to add metal sheaths over plastic aglets for better durability. Some may also add logos or pictures.

<doc id="376100" wikidata="Q559045" url="?curid=376100" title="Shoelaces">
<text>Shoelaces, also called shoestrings (US English) or bootlaces (UK English), are a system commonly used to secure shoes, boots, and other footwear. They typically consist of a pair of strings or cords, one for each shoe, finished off at both ends with stiff sections, known as aglets. Each shoelace typically passes through a series of holes, eyelets, loops or hooks on either side of the shoe. Loosening the lacing allows the shoe to open wide enough for the foot to be inserted or removed. Tightening the lacing and tying off the ends secures the foot firmly within the shoe. The laces can be tied in different shapes, most commonly a simple bow.

== Shoelace construction ==
Traditional shoelaces were made of leather, cotton, jute, hemp, or other materials used in the manufacture of rope. Modern shoelaces often incorporate various synthetic fibers, which are generally more slippery and thus more prone to coming undone than those made from traditional fibers. On the other hand, smooth synthetic shoelaces generally have a less rough appearance, suffer less wear from friction, and are less susceptible to rotting from moisture. Specialized fibers like flame resistant nomex are applied in safety boots for firefighters.

There are also various elasticized shoelaces:
# Traditional &quot;elastic&quot; laces look identical to normal laces, and can simply be tied and untied as normal. They may also come with a permanent clip so they can be fastened invisibly.
# &quot;Knotty&quot; laces have a series of &quot;fat&quot; sections, which restrict movement through eyelets. These can be used to adjust tension throughout the lacing area. These laces can be tied or the ends can be left loose.
# &quot;Twirly&quot; laces are like a tight elastic helix, which can simply be pulled tight without requiring a knot.
Elastic laces both make the lacing more comfortable, as well as allowing the shoe to be slipped on and off without tying or untying, which makes them a popular choice for children, the elderly and athletes.
The stiff section at each end of the shoelace, which both keeps the twine from unraveling and also makes it easier to hold the lace and feed it through the eyelets, is called an &quot;aglet,&quot; also spelled &quot;aiglet.&quot;

Shoelaces with a flat cross-section are generally easier to hold and stay tied more securely than those with a round cross-section due to the increased surface area for friction. Very wide flat laces are often called &quot;fat laces&quot;. Leather shoelaces with a square cross-section, which are very common on boat shoes, are notoriously prone to coming undone.

Shoelaces can be coated, either in the factory or with aftermarket products, to increase friction and help them stay tied.

== Shoelace tying ==

When a shoelace is secured with a knot, the lace is crimped, or squashed. Primarily this is what stops the lace from coming undone. In effect, the lace is narrower inside the knot than it is on the loose end, and the loose end cannot make itself smaller and slide though the knot. Generally, a flat tubular lace will stay tied more easily than a round lace with a core because the flat lace can be more crimped within the knot. Most laces, however, are round and have core of cotton yarn, especially boot laces. For these to stay tied securely, the core on the inside of the lace must be soft and compressible. A secondary factor of laces coming undone is the knot itself slipping. This is due to a lack of friction. Cotton laces have a rough surface and will make a more reliable knot compared to polyester (the most common yarn used in shoelaces). In addition, a lace can be smooth or have a coarse surface, which will also affect performance. Finishing processes are available, including waxing and silicone treatments, which enhance friction and stop knot slippage. These are important design factors in the manufacture of hiking-boot laces.

Shoelaces are typically tied off at the top of the shoe using a simple bow knot. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of shoelace exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half-knots tied one on top of the other, with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick untying. When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.

When tying the half-knots, a right-over-left half-knot followed by a left-over-right half-knot (or vice versa) forms a square or reef knot, a fairly effective knot for the purpose of tying shoelaces. However, tying two consecutive right-over-left half-knots (or two consecutive left-over-right half-knots) forms the infamous granny knot, which is much less secure. Most people who use it will find themselves regularly retying their shoelaces.

If the loops lie across the shoe (left to right), the knot is probably a square knot. If they lie along the shoe (heel to toe), the knot is probably a granny knot.

===Other more secure knots===
There are several more secure alternatives to the common shoelace bow, with names such as Turquoise Turtle Shoelace Knot, or &quot;Shoemaker&#x27;s Knot&quot;, Better Bow Shoelace Knot, Surgeon&#x27;s Shoelace Knot, and Ian&#x27;s Secure Shoelace Knot, or &quot;double slip knot&quot;. One such knot has been patented in 1999 under the title &quot;Shoelace tying system&quot;. These are all variations of the same concept of looping the top part of the knot twice instead of once, which results in a finished bow of almost identical appearance but with the laces wrapped twice around the middle. This double-wrap holds the shoelaces more securely tied while still allowing them to be untied with a (slightly firmer) pull on the loose end(s). Possibly the simplest, also neat and quite effective, is after tying a common bow to tie a half-hitch with one or other loose end around its adjacent half bow, close to the knot; it is untied by pulling on the other (unhitched) free end.

===Length===
The proper length of a shoelace, fitting it to a shoe, varies according to the type of lacing used, as well as the type of lace. However, at a rough reference the following guide can be used.
== Shoe lacing ==
This is the process of running the shoelaces through the holes, eyelets, loops, or hooks to hold together the sides of the shoe with many common lacing methods. There are, in fact, almost two trillion ways to lace a shoe with six pairs of eyelets.

=== Common lacing methods ===

==== Straight-bar lacing ====
Straight-bar lacing appears horizontal and parallel when viewed from the exterior. Formal shoes usually demand straight-bar lacing to preserve their clean, neat look. This is especially true for dress shoes using a closed lacing system such as Oxfords, because the central shoelace crossovers of criss-cross lacing prevent the sides of the shoe from coming together in the middle.

==== Criss-cross lacing ====

The most common lacing method, termed &quot;criss-cross lacing&quot;, is also one of the strongest and most efficient. However, they are reserved for more casual footwear, such as sneakers and boots. Derby shoes can be straight-bar laced or criss-cross laced.

==== Other lacing methods ====
Many shoe lacing methods have been developed with specific functional benefits, such as being faster or easier to tighten or loosen, binding more tightly, being more comfortable, using up more lace or less lace, adjusting fit, preventing slippage, and suiting specific types of shoes. One such method, patented in 2003 as &quot;Double helix shoe lacing process&quot;, runs in a double helix pattern and results in less friction and faster and easier tightening and loosening. Another method, called &quot;Rinlers Instant Lace Up&quot;, use additional accessories for instant tightening and loosening.
Many other lacing methods have been developed purely for appearance, often at the expense of functionality. One of the most popular decorative methods, checkerboard lacing, is very difficult to tighten or loosen without destroying the pattern. Shoes with checkerboard lacing are generally treated as &quot;slip-ons&quot;.

== History ==
It is as difficult to determine the exact history of shoelaces as it is for shoes. Archaeological records of footwear are rare because shoes were generally made of materials that deteriorated readily. The Armenian Areni-1 shoe, which has been dated to around 3500 BC, is a simple leather shoe with leather &quot;shoelaces&quot; passing through slotted &quot;eyelets&quot; cut into the hide. The more complex shoes worn by Ötzi the Iceman, who lived around 3300 BC, were bound with &quot;shoelaces&quot; made of lime bark string. Most forms of the upper-class Roman calceus were bound with wide straps fitted into hooks or eyelets down the front and then knotted decoratively.

As for shoelaces in the sense that we know them in modern times, the Museum of London has documented examples of medieval footwear dating from as far back as the 12th century, which clearly show the lacing passing through a series of hooks or eyelets down the front or side of the shoe and being tied in a knot rather than hanging loose. Indeed, the code of the Knights Templar banned the wearing of shoelaces as a vanity that was &quot;abominable and pagan&quot;.

===Myths===
A popular myth states that Gurkha soldiers, fighting for Britain, crawled along the ground, feeling the laces of the soldiers they encountered. British soldiers employed straight- or bar-lacing, while Japanese troops employed a criss-cross pattern. Criss-cross laces could therefore mean the difference between life and death. The importance of correct lacing was thus emphasized to British troops. Whether true or not, there is an account of Gurkha soldiers checking the boots and laces of soldiers they encounter in the dark to find if they are friend or foe.

== Shoelace accessories ==

There are many shoelace accessories. There are hooks to help lace shoelaces tightly. They are especially useful for skates where tight lacing is important. Shoelace covers protect the laces, especially in wrestling. Shoelace charms are decorative, as are colored shoelaces. Some laces are colored using expensive dyes, other, more &quot;personal&quot; colors, are drawn-on with permanent markers. Some dress codes (especially high schools) will specifically exclude color laces and charms. Lace-locks hold laces together, eliminating the need for tying. There are shoelace tags, sometimes called deubré, with two holes or slots through which the shoelace is passed. These are worn on the section of shoelace closest to the toes, in other words the last lace, so that the image or writing on the tag is visible (as can be seen at right).

Magnetic shoe closures are a type of adaptive clothing accessory which can be laced onto the shoe and used to tighten or loosen the shoe, without the wearer having to tie or untie the laces.

<text>Soundsystem is the fifth studio album by 311, released on October 12, 1999. &quot;Soundsystem&quot;, which was certified Gold by the RIAA, was the last 311 album on Capricorn Records before the band switched to Volcano Records in 2000. Recording processes for the album began on March 11, 1999.

==Reception==
&quot;Soundsystem&quot; was met with mostly mixed reviews from critics, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; discussing their mix of various genres, commenting &quot;they offer their most ambitious fusion yet -- each track is a whirlwind tour of their soulful influences. Alas, the ingredients usually refuse to mix in 311&#x27;s hands, resulting in disjunctions that veer between the bland and the unintentionally funny&quot;.

<doc id="376115" wikidata="Q498478" url="?curid=376115" title="South Africa national rugby union team">
<text>The South Africa national rugby union team, commonly known as the Springboks (colloquially the Boks, Bokke or Amabhokobhoko), is the country&#x27;s national team governed by the South African Rugby Union. The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys with white shorts, and their emblem is the Springbok, a native antelope and the national animal of South Africa. The team has represented South African Rugby Union in international rugby union since 30 July 1891, when they played their first test match against a British Isles touring team. Currently, the Springboks are the reigning World Champions, having won the World Cup a record four times (1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023). South Africa are the only team to have won half of the Rugby World Cups they have participated in, and are also the second nation to win the World Cup consecutively (2019 and 2023). 

The team made its World Cup debut in 1995, when the newly democratic South Africa hosted the tournament. Although South Africa was instrumental in creating the Rugby World Cup competition, the Springboks could not compete in the first two World Cups in 1987 and 1991 due to international anti-apartheid sporting boycotts. The Springboks&#x27; victory over the All Blacks 15–12 in the 1995 final is remembered as one of the greatest moments in South Africa&#x27;s sporting history, and a watershed moment in the post-apartheid nation-building process. This cast a new light on South Africa, where people of all colour united as one nation to watch their team play. 

South Africa regained the world champions title 12 years later by defeating England 15–6 in the 2007 final. Following their 2007 World Cup victory, the Springboks ascended to first place in the IRB World Rankings, a position they held until July of the following year when New Zealand reclaimed the top spot. The team was named 2008 World Team of the Year at the Laureus World Sports Awards. South Africa then won their third World Cup title, defeating England 32–12 in the 2019 final, and were named 2020 World Team of the Year at the Laureus World Sports Awards for the second time. They retained their world champions title in 2023.

The Springboks also compete in the annual Rugby Championship &quot;(formerly the Tri-Nations)&quot;, along with their Southern Hemisphere counterparts Argentina, Australia and New Zealand. They have won the Championship five times in 27 competitions and are the only team to have won a version of the competition and the Rugby World Cup in the same year.

Rugby union is a highly popular sport in South Africa, often attracting the country&#x27;s most talented athletes. For nearly a century, South Africans have rallied behind the Springboks, the team&#x27;s success has transcended the sport, becoming a symbol of national pride recognized even by those who don&#x27;t follow rugby. 

Sixteen former Springboks and influential South Africans have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.

Many teams have suffered their biggest record defeats to the Springboks, including Australia, Italy, Scotland, Uruguay, Wales and New Zealand.

== History ==
=== First internationals: 1891–1913 ===

The first British Isles tour took place in 1891, at Diocesan College. These were the first representative games played by South African sides. The tourists won all twenty matches they played, conceding only one point.
The British Isles&#x27; success continued on their tour of 1896, winning three out of four tests against South Africa. South Africa&#x27;s play greatly improved from 1891, and their first test win in the final game was a pointer to the future.
In 1903 the British Isles lost a series for the first time in South Africa, drawing the opening two tests before losing the last 8–0. Rugby was given a huge boost by the early Lions tours, which created great interest in the South African press. South Africa would not lose another series—home or away—until 1956.
The first South African team to tour the British Isles and France occurred during 1906–07. The team played tests against all four Home Nations. England managed a draw, but Scotland was the only one of the Home unions to gain a victory. The trip instilled a sense of national pride among South Africans.
The South Africans played an unofficial match against a &#x27;France&#x27; team while the official French team were in England; the Springboks won 55–6.
It was during this tour that the nickname &quot;Springboks&quot; was first used.

The 1910 British Isles tour of South Africa was the first to include representatives from all four Home unions. The tourists won just one of their three tests. The Boks&#x27; second European tour took place in 1912–13. They beat the four Home nations to earn their first Grand Slam, and also defeated France.

=== Inter war ===

By the first World War, New Zealand and South Africa had established themselves as rugby&#x27;s two greatest powers. A Springbok tour to New Zealand and Australia in 1921 was billed as &quot;The World Championship of Rugby&quot;. The All Blacks won the first Test 13–5, The Springboks recovered to win the second Test 9–5, and the final Test was drawn 0–0, resulting in a series draw.

The 1924 British Lions team lost three of the four Tests to the Springboks, drawing the other. This was the first side to pick up the name Lions, apparently picked up from the Lions embroidered on their ties.
The All Blacks first toured South Africa in 1928, and again the Test series finished level. The Springboks won the first Test 17–0 to inflict the All Blacks&#x27; heaviest defeat since 1893. The All Blacks rebounded to win the second Test 7–6. After a Springbok win in the third Test, the All Blacks won 13–5 to draw the series.

Despite winning South Africa&#x27;s second Grand Slam, the Springbok tourists of 1931–32 were an unloved team, due to their tactics of kicking for territory. It was successful however, winning against England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as defeating all their Welsh opponents for the first time.
In 1933, Australia toured South Africa, with the Springboks winning the series 3–2.

In 1937, South Africa toured New Zealand and Australia and their 2–1 series win prompted them to be called &quot;the best team to ever leave New Zealand&quot;.

The British Isles toured South Africa again in 1938, winning the majority of their tour matches. The Springboks secured easy victories in the first two tests. However, the Lions bounced back to record a win in the third test, for the first Lions win on South Africa soil since 1910.

=== Post-war era ===
Danie Craven was appointed coach in 1949, and started his coaching career winning ten matches in a row, including a 4–0 whitewash of New Zealand on their 1949 tour to South Africa.

The 1951–52 team that toured Europe was considered amongst the finest Springbok sides to tour. The team won the Grand Slam as well as defeating France. Hennie Muller captained the side. The South African highlight of the tour was a 44–0 defeat of Scotland. The team finished with only one loss, to London Counties, from 31 matches.

In 1953, Australia toured South Africa for the second time and although they lost the series, they defeated South Africa 18–14 in the second test. The 1955 British Lions tour to South Africa four-test series ended in a draw.

In 1956, Springboks toured Australasia the All Blacks won its first series over the Springboks, in &quot;the most bitterly fought series in history.&quot;

When France toured South Africa in 1958 they were not expected to compete. France exceeded expectations and drew 3–3. The French then secured a Test series victory with a 9–5 victory.

=== Anti-apartheid protests: 1960s–1970s ===
In 1960, international criticism of apartheid grew in the wake of &quot;The Wind of Change&quot; speech and the Sharpeville massacre. The Springboks increasingly became the target of international protest. The All Blacks toured South Africa in 1960, despite a 150,000 signature petition opposing it. The Springboks avenged their 1956 series defeat by winning the four-match test series 2–1 with one draw. that same year the Springboks toured Europe, and they defeated all four Home unions for their fourth Grand Slam.

The 1962 British Lions tour to South Africa lost three of the four tests, drawing the other. In 1963 the touring Wallabies beat the Springboks in consecutive tests, the first team to do so since the 1896 British team. In 1964, in Wales&#x27; first overseas tour they played one test match against South Africa, losing 3–24, their biggest defeat in 40 years.

South Africa had a poor year in 1965, losing matches in a tour of Ireland and Scotland, and in a tour of Australia and New Zealand.

The planned 1967 tour by the All Blacks was cancelled by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union after the South African government refused to allow Maori players. In 1968 the Lions toured and lost three Tests and drew one.

Next year in the 1969–70 Springbok tour to the UK and Ireland the Springboks lost test matches against England and Scotland, and drew against Ireland and Wales. Throughout the tour however, large anti-apartheid demonstrations meant that several matches had to be played behind barbed wire fences.

In 1970, the All Blacks toured South Africa once again—after the South African government agreed to treat Maoris in the team and Maori spectators as &#x27;honorary whites&#x27;. The Springboks won the test series 3–1.

In the Springbok tour of Australia in 1971, the Springboks won all three tests. As in Britain three years before, however, massive anti-apartheid demonstrations greeted the team, and they had to be transported by the Royal Australian Air Force after the trade unions refused to service planes or trains transporting them. A planned tour of New Zealand for 1973 was blocked by New Zealand Prime Minister Norman Kirk on the grounds of public safety.

The Lions team that toured South Africa in 1974 triumphed 3–0 (with one drawn) in the test series. A key feature was the Lions&#x27; infamous &#x27;99 call&#x27;. Lions management had decided that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, so decided &quot;to get their retaliation in first&quot;. At the call of &#x27;99&#x27; each Lions player would attack their nearest rival player. The &quot;battle of Boet Erasmus Stadium&quot; was one of the most violent matches in rugby history.

=== Sporting isolation: 1970s–1980s ===
The 1976 All Blacks tour of South Africa went ahead, and the Springboks won by three Tests to one, but coming shortly after the Soweto riots the tour attracted international condemnation. Twenty-eight countries boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in protest, and in 1977 the Gleneagles Agreement discouraged any Commonwealth sporting contact with South Africa. In response to the growing pressure, the segregated South African rugby unions merged in 1977. A planned 1979 Springbok tour of France was blocked by the French government.

The Lions toured South Africa in 1980, losing the first three tests before winning the last one.

The 1981 Springbok tour of New Zealand went ahead in defiance of the Gleneagles Agreement. South Africa lost the series 1–2. The tour and the massive civil disruption in New Zealand had ramifications far beyond rugby. In 1981, Errol Tobias became the first non-white South African to represent his country when he took the field against Ireland. South Africa sought to counteract its sporting isolation by inviting the South American Jaguars to tour. The team contained mainly Argentinian players. Eight matches were played between the two teams in the early 1980s—all awarded Test status. In 1984, England toured losing both test matches; of the players selected, only Ralph Knibbs of Bristol refused to tour for political reasons.

Due to the isolation from apartheid, from 1985 to 1991, South Africa did not play a single test match against an established country, although South Africa did play some matches against makeshift teams.
In 1985, a planned All Black tour of South Africa was stopped by the New Zealand High Court. A rebel tour took place the next year by a team known as the Cavaliers, which consisted of all but two of the original squad. The Springboks won the series 3–1. In 1989, a World XV sanctioned by the International Rugby Board went on a mini-tour of South Africa; all traditional rugby nations bar New Zealand supplied players to the team.
South Africa was not permitted by the International Rugby Board to compete in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, nor in the following 1991 Rugby World Cup.

=== Rainbow nation and 1995 World Cup ===
Apartheid was abolished during 1990–91, and the Springboks were readmitted to international rugby in 1992. They struggled to return to their pre-isolation standards in their first games after readmission. During the 1992 All Blacks tour, the first to South Africa since 1976, the Springboks were defeated 24–27 by New Zealand, and suffered a 3–26 loss to Australia the following month.

South Africa hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup, with a surge of support for the Springboks among the white and black communities behind the slogan &quot;one team, one country.&quot; This was the first major international sports event to be held in the Rainbow Nation. By the time they hosted the 1995 World Cup, the Springboks, coached by Kitch Christie, were seeded ninth. They won their pool by defeating Australia, Romania, and Canada. Wins in the quarter-final against Western Samoa (42–14) and in the semi-final against France (19–15) sent the Springboks to the final.
South Africa won the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final against the All Blacks 15–12 in extra-time.
President Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok shirt, presented the trophy to captain Francois Pienaar, a white Afrikaner. The gesture was widely seen as a major step towards the reconciliation of white and black South Africans.

A series of crises followed in 1995 through 1997. Christie resigned in 1996 due to leukaemia. South Africa struggled in the new Tri-Nations competition, the All Blacks won a test series in South Africa for the first time in 1996, and the Lions won their 1997 South African tour test series two games to one. Coach Andre Markgraaff was fired in 1997 due to a racist comment he made. The team suffered successive defeats in the Lions 1997 tour and the 1997 Tri Nations Series. 

In 1997, coach Nick Mallett coached South Africa&#x27;s unbeaten 1997 tour of Europe, and in 1998 the Boks tied the then-existing record for longest test winning streak, winning 17 consecutive tests, including the 1998 Tri-Nations.
At the 1999 Rugby World Cup the Springboks reached the semi-finals of the competition, where they lost to eventual champions .
During the 2002 and 2003 seasons, the Springboks lost by record margins to England (3–53), France, Scotland and New Zealand. At the 2003 Rugby World Cup, they were eliminated in the quarter-final round – their worst showing to date.

Following wins during the June 2004 tours, the Boks won the 2004 Tri Nations Series. The Springboks won the 2004 IRB International Team of the Year award. The Springboks finished second in the 2005 Tri-Nations.
The 2006 Springboks lost to France, ending their long undefeated home record. A poor 2006 Tri Nations Series included two losses to the Wallabies. Coach Jake White told the press in July 2006 that he had been unable to pick some white players for his squad &quot;because of transformation&quot;—a reference to the ANC government&#x27;s policies to redress racial imbalances in sport.

=== 2007 Rugby World Cup victory ===
At the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, the Springboks won their pool. The Springboks then defeated Fiji 37–20 in the quarter-finals, and Argentina 37–13 in the semi-finals. In the final they prevailed 15–6 over England to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for a second time.

In January 2008, Peter de Villiers was appointed as the first non-white coach of the Springboks. De Villiers&#x27;s first squad included ten of colour. The team finishes last in the Tri Nations, but notched several wins during their 2008 end of year tour.

The 2009 season was more successful. The Boks earned a 2–1 series win over the Lions, and then won the 2009 Tri Nations Series. However, during the November tests they lost their top spot in the IRB rankings with losses to France and Ireland. Nonetheless, the Boks were named IRB International Team of the Year.

The Boks&#x27; June 2010 test campaign included a win over France (their first victory over the French since 2005).
However, the Boks performed poorly in the 2010 Tri Nations campaign, sliding to third in the world rankings.
In the 2011 Tri Nations the Boks rested a number of players in preparation for the upcoming World Cup. At the 2011 Rugby World Cup, the Springboks topped their group before falling to Australia 9–11 in the quarter-finals.

=== 2018–present: Erasmus/Kolisi era and Rugby World Cup success ===
Following the sacking of Allister Coetzee in February 2018, Rassie Erasmus was named head coach of the national team, alongside his duties as Director of Rugby at SA Rugby, on 1 March 2018 and immediately decided to appoint Siya Kolisi as the new Springbok captain, a landmark decision.

In his first match in charge, Erasmus awarded thirteen new players their first test cap, in a one-off match in Washington, D.C. in a 22–20 loss to Wales. A week later, he secured his first win, a 42–39 victory over England, during their three-test series. The series title was clinched in the second test, with the Springboks winning 23–12, to secure a series victory. However, South Africa were unable to gain the clean-sweep, after losing the third test, 25–10. During the 2018 Rugby Championship, Erasmus led the Springboks to second, their best placing since 2014. The 2018 Championship saw South Africa win three games, including a thrilling 36–34 victory over New Zealand in Wellington, South Africa&#x27;s first win in New Zealand since 2009. Erasmus later revealed that had the Springboks lost that match, he would have resigned: &quot;We [had recently] lost to Australia and Argentina, and if we didn&#x27;t win in Wellington I would have resigned... I have never lost three games in a row as a coach and if I did that I don&#x27;t deserve to be a Springbok coach. We played New Zealand in Wellington and that was important, as if we lost it I wouldn&#x27;t be here.&quot; South Africa came within moments of reclaiming the Freedom Cup in the final round, but an All Black try in the dying moments of the game helped New Zealand snatch victory in 32–30 win in Pretoria and retain the cup.

====2019 Rugby World Cup====
The Springboks won the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan after defeating England 32–12 in the final. It was the first time that a Black South African rugby captain got to lift the Webb Ellis Cup, as well as the first time that a team won a final with a defeat in pool stages, the captain being Siya Kolisi who presented South African president Cyril Ramaphosa the number 6 jersey to commemorate Nelson Mandela, who wore the same numbered jersey during the 1995 Rugby World Cup.

The final match between South Africa and England served as a rematch between the two in reference to the 2007 Rugby World Cup final. This marks the third time South Africa has won the World Cup which ties the team with the All Blacks for most Rugby World Cup wins.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Springboks, were affected by the cancellation and postponement of several matches, as well as concerns over player welfare and safety. However, the Springboks were able to continue playing international rugby through strict COVID-19 protocols. 

In August 2020, South Africa withdrew from the Rugby Championship due to concerns over player welfare and COVID-19 restrictions. The tournament proceeded without the Springboks, who were the defending champions. 

In July 2021, South Africa made their return to international rugby after a year-long absence due to the pandemic.

====2023 Rugby World Cup====
The Springboks faced a tough pool that included the likes of Ireland and Scotland. They suffered a narrow defeat to Ireland. However, they bounced back with convincing victories in the remaining pool matches.

The Bomb Squad: The Springboks&#x27; dominance in the scrums became a defining feature of their knock-out stage success. The introduction of the &quot;Bomb Squad&quot; – a group of fresh front-row substitutes – in the later stages of matches proved to be a game-changer.

Throughout the tournament, the Springboks displayed a resolute defensive performance. They conceded the fewest penalties of any team and their tackling technique was exceptional. This defensive solidity provided a crucial foundation for their success. 

The Springboks secured three dramatic 1-point victories during the 2023 Rugby World Cup:

Quarter Final vs France: In a nail-biting encounter against the host nation, the Springboks fought tenaciously throughout the match. The score remained close, but their determination paid off as they emerged victorious with a final score of 29–28.

Semi Final vs England: Another tense affair, this game tested the Springboks&#x27; grit. They battled fiercely against England, with the score seesawing throughout. Displaying nerves of steel, the Springboks clinched the win with a last-minute penalty, ending the game at 16–15.

Final vs New Zealand: A thrilling 80 minutes that kept fans on the edge of their seats. The All Blacks were reduced to 14 men in the first half after captain Sam Cane was sent off for a dangerous tackle. Despite their numerical advantage, the Springboks faced strong defense from New Zealand. However, they managed to secure a narrow victory, with the final score at 12–11.

The 2023 Springboks were a team that embodied the spirit of unity. Their diverse squad, with players from various backgrounds and cultures, came together under the banner of &quot;Together in One Nation, One Team.&quot; 

The Springboks were crowned Rugby World Cup champions for the fourth time, making them the first nation to win 4 titles and their second in a row. Having only played 8 tournaments, this has given South Africa a 50% win rate at World Cups.

== Crest, colours and jersey ==

=== Team name and emblem ===
Paul Roos&#x27;s team first introduced the Springbok emblem during their 1906–07 tour of Britain to prevent the British press from inventing their own name for the team. At that time, the emblem promoted unity among white English and Afrikaans-speaking players following the two Anglo-Boer Wars of the late 19th century. Although the Springbok was briefly adopted by the first colored national rugby team in 1939 and by their first black counterparts in 1950, it soon became exclusively associated with segregated sporting codes.

From 1906 onwards, South African rugby officials and the national team were historically linked with racism. The Springbok emblem symbolized the exclusion of non-white players under apartheid, representing apartheid itself. Initially, the first Springboks refused to play against a Devon side that included Jimmy Peters, the first black player to represent England. Notable figures like Danie Craven, a legendary official, national coach, and Springbok scrumhalf, reluctantly complied with government demands to have Māori players excluded from the visiting All Black teams. Craven also asserted that the Springbok was intrinsically tied to the white identity of the national rugby team.
Since the end of apartheid, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) has sought to replace the Springbok emblem with a neutral symbol representing a break from the past, the King Protea, South Africa&#x27;s national flower, was chosen for this purpose, leading to the national cricket team being named the Proteas for example. A similar change was envisioned for the national rugby team. Consequently, from 1992, the national rugby team jersey featured a King Protea alongside the Springbok.

As portrayed in the film &quot;Invictus&quot;, pressure to replace the Springbok emblem intensified in 1994, just before the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa. However, Nelson Mandela, a devoted fan of the Springbok rugby team, intervened, leading the ANC&#x27;s executive to reappropriate the emblem instead of abolishing it. After the national team won the 1995 Rugby World Cup, black rugby pioneer Dan Qeqe stated, &quot;The Springboks play for all of us.&quot;

In March 2004, the South African Sports Commission ratified a decision for the Protea to be the official rugby emblem on blazers and caps, allowing the Springbok to remain on the team jersey and the traditional Springbok colours. In November 2007, the ANC&#x27;s special conference in Polokwane reiterated the need for a single symbol for all sporting codes. Critics like Qondisa Ngwenya predicted a loss of revenue from abandoning the Springbok emblem, while others like Cheeky Watson advocated for an alternative, unifying symbol.

Furthermore, South African Rugby (SARU) has not made any official moves to change the emblem. Instead, efforts have been made to ensure that the emblem represents unity and inclusivity.

=== Jersey ===
South Africa plays in green jerseys with a gold collar and trim, white shorts and green socks. The jersey is embroidered with the SA Rugby logo on the wearer&#x27;s left chest and the springbok logo on the right chest.

The first shirt worn by South Africa was navy blue during their Tests against the British Isles on the Lions tour of 1891.

The green jersey was first adopted when the British Isles toured South Africa in 1903. After playing the first two Tests in white shirts, South Africa wore a green jersey (supplied by the Diocesan College rugby team) for the first time in their final Test at Newlands. 

On their first tour to Great Britain and Ireland in 1906–07 South Africa wore a green jersey with a white collar, blue shorts, and blue socks, taken from the Diocesan College.

When Australia first toured South Africa in 1933, the visitors wore sky blue jerseys to avoid confusion, as both teams wore dark green jerseys at the time. In 1953, when Australia toured again, the Springboks wore white jerseys for the test matches. In 1961, Australia changed their jersey to gold to avoid further colour clashes.

Traditionally, South Africa&#x27;s away uniform consisted of a white shirt, usually with a gold collar, black shorts, and socks, as seen in the 1981 Test against Ireland.

During the match against England at Twickenham in 2002, South Africa became the first team to sport player names on the back of the jerseys.

In 2006, against Ireland in Dublin, a replica of the first jersey was worn to mark the centenary of the Springbok rugby team.
In December 2008, the SARU decided to place the protea on the left side of the Boks&#x27; jersey, in line with other South African national teams, and move the springbok to the right side of the jersey. The was worn for the first time during the British &amp; Irish Lions&#x27; 2009 tour of South Africa.

For the 2015 Rugby World Cup, the springbok was moved from the front of the jersey to the right sleeve while the Protea remained on the front. This change was due to World Cup regulations stating that only the IRB logo and the main team logo could appear on the front of the shirt. Several South African rugby fans voiced their disappointment and anger at the reveal of the 2015 shirt due to the springbok not being on the front of the shirt.

In 2017, the Springboks wore a red change jersey in Argentina as part of an Asics promotion where the Springboks and Blitzboks wore jerseys in all the colours of the South African flag during the course of the season—the main side wore green, white, and red shirts, while the sevens team sported gold, blue and black uniforms.

==== Sponsors on kit ====
American company Nike is the kit provider for all the South Africa rugby teams from July 2023, through a six-year contract signed with the SARU. South Africa&#x27;s shirt sponsor is local mobile phone provider MTN Group. Additional uniform sponsors are FNB on the back above the numbers, and Betway, FlySafair, Dell, and Switch Energy Drink rotating on the rear hems of the shorts.

* During the 1986 New Zealand Cavaliers tour, the Springboks had the Toyota logo on the opposite side of the Springbok, making it the first time a sponsor logo appeared in a Springbok jersey.

* In a 2001 autumn international against France in Saint-Denis, the logo on their kit was replaced by Charles (which is an allusion to Charles Glass, the founder of Castle Brewery) because of the Evin law, which prohibits alcohol companies from advertising during sports events in France.

== Home grounds ==
The Springboks do not use a single stadium as their home, but they play out of a number of venues throughout South Africa.

The first South African international took place in 1891 at Port Elizabeth&#x27;s Crusader Grounds. The playing field, which is shared with the Port Elizabeth Cricket Club, is also known as St George&#x27;s Park Cricket Ground.

===Main stadiums===


The 60,000 seat Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg was the main venue for the 1995 World Cup, where the Springboks defeated the All Blacks in the final. Ellis Park was built in 1928, and in 1955 hosted a record 100,000 people in a Test between South Africa and the British &amp; Irish Lions.

The Springboks are said to have a notable advantage over touring sides when playing at high altitude on the Highveld. Games at Ellis Park, Loftus Versfeld, or Vodacom Park are said to present physical problems, and to influence a match in a number of other ways, such as the ball travelling further when kicked. Experts disagree on whether touring team&#x27;s traditionally poor performances at altitude are more due to a state of mind rather than an actual physical challenge.

===Other stadiums===

The Springboks played their first test match at FNB Stadium also known as Soccer City Stadium on 21 August 2010, a Tri Nations match against New Zealand.

== Records ==
===Team records===
*&quot;List of South Africa national rugby union team records&quot;

=== Individual records ===

Siya Kolisi has become the most decorated South African Captain, having won Two-World Cups back to back in 2019 Japan and 2023 France (equaling the New Zealand team led by Richie McCaw who also won back to back world cups in 2011 and 2015) as Captain. Further to that, as Captain he now stands alone as the only Springboks Captain to have led South Africa to four consecutive wins against the mighty All Blacks. Prior to that he shared the record with former Captain&#x27;s John Smit (2007) and Felix du Plessis (1949). He also has now won as Captain, the most trophy&#x27;s in one year (2024) than any other Springboks Captain before him. The Qatar Airways Cup , The Mandela Challenge Plate, The Freedom Cup, The Rugby Championship and The Prince William Cup. It is also under his Captaincy that South Africa Hold not only the World Cup consecutively, but also led his charges to win the British &amp; Irish Lions Series in 2021 held in South Africa. A feat that Richie McCaw couldn&#x27;t achieve with Kieran Read leading the All Blacks in the 2017 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand which ended up being tied.

South Africa&#x27;s most capped player is Eben Etzebeth with 131 caps. The Lock broke the record previously held by Victor Matfield on the 28th of September 2024 in a test match against Argentina. The most-capped back is Bryan Habana. Percy Montgomery holds the South African record for Test points with 893, which at the time of his international retirement placed him sixth on the all-time list of Test point scorers (he now stands twelfth).

John Smit was the world&#x27;s most-capped captain, having captained South Africa in 83 of his 111 Tests, but has since been overtaken. Smit also played a record 46 consecutive matches for South Africa.

The record try scorer is Bryan Habana from 124 games for the Springboks, with 67 tries.(as of 14 February 2018)

The most prolific all time try-scorer of the post-Apartheid era is Makazole Mapimpi, whose try scoring ratio is far superior to that of Bryan Habana (67 tries from 124 tests) who clocks at 54% ratio and the likes of Joost van der Westhuizen (second highest nos of tries for the Boks with 38 tries from 89 tests) and Jacques Fourie (joint third with Mapimpi having 32 tries from 72 tests) by miles, having been a late starter for the Boks, and so far has played less than 50 games for the Springboks. His current 69% ratio is higher than that of Habana and any other post-Apartheid national player. Many may quote the Apartheid-era legend Danie Gerber who notched a 79% try scoring ratio (24 tests with 19 tries scored), as being the greatest, but the modern game of Habana and Mapimpi, far surpasses that of the apartheid -era period.Where Gerber&#x27;s tries came from 12 years of being a Springbok. Mapimpi only has been a Springbok since 2018, a paltry 6 years.

As of 8 October 2019, Cobus Reinach scored the earliest hat-trick in World Cup history.

=== Longest winning streak ===
The South African Springboks&#x27; longest winning streak is 17 consecutive Test victories, which they achieved between August 1997 and December 1998. This record was set under coach Nick Mallett and captain Gary Teichmann, and during this time the Springboks scored more than 50 points five times and beat Wales 96-13. They also defeated France, Australia, England, Ireland, New Zealand, and Scotland on multiple occasions.

== Rankings ==

 World Rugby Ranking Leaders 

South Africa is one of the most successful rugby union teams in history. When the ranking system was first introduced in October 2003, South Africa were ranked sixth. Their ranking fluctuated until their victory in the 2007 Rugby World Cup briefly sent them to the summit of the rankings.

Overall, the South African Springboks and the New Zealand All Blacks have held the number 1 ranking in the world rankings since its introduction in October 2003 for just over 94% of the time (with the New Zealand All Blacks holding the top spot for just over 70% of the time and the South African Springboks holding the top spot for just over 24% of that time). The remaining time at the top of the world rankings are shared between the leading Northern Hemisphere teams, England (the only Northern Hemisphere team to win a World Cup title in 2003), Wales, France and Ireland.

The South African Springboks are the only team to have won the Rugby World Cup four times, with each being in 1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023 respectively. The New Zealand All Blacks have won the title in 1987, 2011 and 2015. The Springboks currently have an overall winning % against all nations (including the British and Irish Lions) except for the New Zealand All Blacks.

== Games played ==

=== Tournaments ===

==== Rugby Championship ====
The Springboks only yearly tournament is The Rugby Championship (formerly Tri-Nations), involving Australia and New Zealand since 1996, with Argentina joining the competition in 2012. The Springboks have won the tournament four times (1998, 2004, 2009, 2019). South Africa also participates in the Mandela Challenge Plate with Australia, and the Freedom Cup with New Zealand as part of the Rugby Championship.
==== Rugby World Cup ====

The Springboks did not participate in the 1987 and 1991 World Cups because of the sporting boycott that apartheid brought against them. 

South Africa&#x27;s introduction to the event was as hosts. They defeated the defending Champions Australia 27–18 in the opening match, and went on to defeat the All Blacks 15–12 after extra time in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final, with a drop goal from 40 metres by Joel Stransky.

In 1999, South Africa experienced their first World Cup loss when they were defeated 21–27 by Australia in their semi-final, they went on to defeat the All Blacks 22–18 in the Third-Fourth play-off match. 

The worst ever South African performance at a World Cup was in 2003 when they lost a pool game to England, and then were knocked out of the tournament by the All Blacks in their quarter-final. 

In 2007, the Springboks defeated Fiji in the quarter-finals and Argentina in the semi-finals. They then defeated England in the Grand Final 15–6 to win the tournament for a second time. 

In 2011, the Springboks were defeated by Australia 9–11 in the quarter-finals after winning all four of their pool games.

In the 2015 World Cup, South Africa suffered a 32–34 loss to Japan in their first pool match on 19 September, and it has been regarded as one of the biggest upsets in Rugby Union history. They made it to the semi-finals but were eventually defeated by the All Blacks 20–18.

In the 2019 RWC, the Springboks lost their first pool match against the All Blacks 23–13, and won the rest of their pool matches to advance to the quarter-finals, where they beat Japan 26–3, beat Wales 19–16 in the semi-finals and beat England 32–12 in the Grand Final to be crowned World Champions. South Africa became the 2nd country ever to win the Rugby World Cup 3 times.

The Springboks won the 2023 Rugby World Cup, defeating New Zealand 12–11 in the final at the Stade de France in Paris on October 28, 2023. It was South Africa&#x27;s fourth Rugby World Cup title, and their second consecutive, having also won in 2019.

===Series played===
Traditionally, most of the Test Matches against other countries happened during Tours/Series. The first team to visit South Africa were the British Lions in 1891 and the first Springbok overseas tour was arranged in 1906–07 to Europe.

=== Overall ===
==== Head to head results ====
Below is the Test Matches played by South Africa up until 23 November 2024. Only fixtures recognised as Test Matches by the South African Rugby Union are listed.
± The Cavaliers was the name given to an unofficial (rebel) New Zealand team that toured South Africa in 1986. The New Zealand Rugby Union did not sanction the team and do not recognise the side as a New Zealand representative team.

== Rivalries ==
=== Springboks vs All Blacks ===
The Springboks&#x27; main rivals are the New Zealand National Rugby Union Team, known as the All Blacks. The two nations have a long history of competing against each other, with matches dating back over a century, and as such, the rivalry has become a defining feature of both nations&#x27; rugby cultures. The only side the Springboks have a losing record to is the All Blacks with all other teams being over a 50 percent winning record.

The two teams are often considered to be the two most successful teams in international rugby union, and as such, a game between South Africa and New Zealand is usually a highly anticipated event in the rugby world.

====Kapa o Pango haka====
The Kapa o Pango haka debuted in 2005, with South Africa being the first team to face it before a match in Dunedin, New Zealand. This choice was deliberate, reflecting the deep rivalry between the All Blacks and the Springboks.

The next year on 2 September 2006 in a game in Rustenburg, the Springboks became the first team of only four to beat the All Blacks in a match that had the &quot;Kapa o Pango&quot; performed prematch with a final score of 21–20. 

The biggest losing margin to the All Blacks for a test with the &quot;Kapa o Pango&quot; haka is 28 points which occurred in a test against South Africa at Twickenham Stadium on 25 August 2023, the final score being 35–7 (also the All Blacks&#x27; biggest defeat in history).

In tests starting with &quot;Kapa o Pango&quot;, the Springboks have emerged victorious against the All Blacks on seven occasions, more than any other rugby team.

===Springboks vs England===

The first time South Africa and England faced each other was in 1903. The historical rivalry between these teams has increased on the back of two Rugby World Cup finals in which the teams faced one another, with the Springboks winning on both occasions in 2007 and 2019. In the 2023 Rugby World Cup campaign, the Springboks played against England in the semi-final. The Springboks won by a score of 16–15, adding further fuel to the rivalry between the two rugby nations.

== Players ==
=== Selection policy ===
Strategic Transformation Development Plan 2030 (STDP 2030): The Transformation Charter adopted at a sports Indaba in 2011 was a &quot;one-size fits all&quot; mechanism to guide sport towards the achievement of the longer term transformation goal of an accessible, equitable, sustainable, competitive and demographically representative sport system.

In the case of demographic representation for example, STDP 2030 target of 60% generic Black (black African, Coloured and Indian representation) was set and is the current milestone towards the ultimate goal of a sport demographic profile in line with the national population demographic of 80% black African, 9% Coloured, 9% White and 2% Indian. However the targets are not legally enforceable quotas.

=== Coach results ===
The role and definition of the South Africa coach has varied significantly over the team&#x27;s history. Hence a comprehensive list of coaches, or head selectors, is impossible. The following table is a list of coaches since the 1949 All Blacks tour to South Africa.
Both World Cup-winning coaches, Christie and White, were inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2011 alongside all other World Cup-winning head coaches through the 2007 edition.

== In popular culture ==
* The combined exploits of Mandela and the Springboks in helping unify the country through rugby union was later chronicled in John Carlin&#x27;s book &quot;Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation&quot;, which in turn inspired Clint Eastwood&#x27;s 2009 Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Invictus&quot; starring Matt Damon as Pienaar and Morgan Freeman as Mandela.
* The conquest of the 2019 title was filmed through a 5-episode SuperSport documentary, named &quot;Chasing the Sun&quot;. 
* &quot;Chasing the Sun 2&quot; – A Story for South Africa, is a five-part documentary series that follows the South African Springboks on their fourth Rugby World Cup victory, the first achievement by any country. The series includes previously unreleased footage and interviews, and premiered on March 24, 2024 on M-Net (DStv Channel 101).
