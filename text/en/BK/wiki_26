<text>Brooklyn Technical High School, commonly called Brooklyn Tech and administratively designated High School 430, is a public high school in New York City that specializes in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It is one of the three original specialized high schools operated by the New York City Department of Education, along with Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science.

Admission to Brooklyn Tech involves taking the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test and scoring the cutoff for Brooklyn Tech. Each November, about 30,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 3-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. About 1,400 to 1,500 students are admitted each year.

Brooklyn Tech counts top scientists, inventors, innovators, &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company CEOs and founders, high-ranking diplomats, academic scholars, literary and media figures, professional athletes, National Medal recipients, Nobel laureates, and Olympic medalists among its alumni.

==Overview==

===Admission===
Admission to Brooklyn Tech is based exclusively on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), open to all eighth-grade and first-time ninth-grade New York City students. The test has math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension and grammar) sections. Of the approximately 30,000 students taking the SHSAT for September 2011 admission, with 23,085 students listing Brooklyn Tech as a choice on their application, about 1,951 offers were made (the most of any of the specialized high schools, partly due to the school&#x27;s size).

===Graduation requirements===
Per the New York State graduation requirements, students can earn a local diploma, a Regents diploma, or an advanced Regents diploma.

To earn a Brooklyn Tech diploma, students must meet &quot;service credit&quot; requirements (which can be dated to at least the 1950s and likely earlier) in addition to the Advanced Regents Diploma requirements.

Beginning with the class of 2010, each student must meet the following requirements by the end of their senior year to receive a Brooklyn Tech diploma:

I. A minimum of 50 hours of community service outside of the school or through specified club activities.

II. A minimum of 32 club credits earned through participation in Tech clubs, teams, and/or participation in designated school related events.

The maximum amount of credits that can be earned per club, team, or event is based on the following criteria, which is cumulative:
# 4 club credits per term to all students who participate in a club;
# 8 club credits per term to all students in Legacy Clubs, Student Government (SGO), Student Productions, and/or PSAL Teams (including Cheerleading);
# 6 club credits per term to all students working on office squads, participating in Student Leadership, who hold membership in a chapter of an honor society, and/or are in a club that represent Brooklyn Tech in some significant activities;
# 2 club credits per term to all students who participate in school-wide events (e.g. Freshman Orientation).

===Reputation===
Brooklyn Tech has been considered a prestigious high school in the United States. Together with Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science, it is one of the three original Specialized High Schools of New York City, operated by the New York City Department of Education, all three of which &quot;The Washington Post&quot; cited in 2006 as among the country&#x27;s best magnet schools (a category the school is often placed in, though its founding predates the concept of a &quot;magnet school&quot;, whose intended purpose was not the same). Admission is by competitive examination. As a public school, Brooklyn Tech has no tuition fee, but only students who reside in New York City are allowed to attend, as per the Hecht-Calandra Act.

Brooklyn Tech ranked 2nd in New York State on the 2021 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; &quot;Best High Schools&quot; list, making it the highest ranked Specialized High School. In 2008, &quot;Newsweek&quot; listed it among five public high schools that were not in the magazine&#x27;s 13 &quot;Public Elite&quot; ranking, explaining, &quot;&quot;Newsweek&quot;″s Challenge Index is designed to recognize schools that challenge average students, and not magnet or charter schools that draw only the best students in their areas. These [...] were excluded from the list of top high schools because [...] their sky-high SAT and ACT scores indicate they have few or no average students&quot;.

==History==
In 1918, Dr. Albert L. Colston, chair of the Math Department at Manual Training High School, recommended establishing a technical high school for Brooklyn boys. His plan envisioned a heavy concentration of math, science, and drafting courses with parallel paths leading either to college or to a technical career in industry. By 1922, Dr. Colston&#x27;s concept was approved by the Board of Education, and Brooklyn Technical High School opened in a converted warehouse at 49 Flatbush Avenue Extension, with 2,400 students. This location, in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, is the reason the school seal bears that bridge&#x27;s image, rather than the more obvious symbol for the borough, the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Tech would occupy one more location before settling into its site at 29 Fort Greene Place, for which the groundbreaking was held in 1930.

===Early years===
Atypical for American high schools, Brooklyn Tech uses a system of college-style majors. The curriculum consists of two years of general studies with a technical and engineering emphasis, followed by two years of a student-chosen major.

The curriculum remained largely unchanged until the end of Dr. Colston&#x27;s 20-year term as principal in 1942. Upon his retirement, Tech was led briefly by acting principal Ralph Breiling, who was succeeded by Principal Harold Taylor in 1944. Tech&#x27;s modernization would come under Principal William Pabst, who assumed stewardship in 1946 after serving as chair of the Electrical Department. Pabst created new majors and refined older ones, allowing students to select science and engineering preparatory majors including Aeronautical, Architecture, Chemical, Civil, Electrical (later including Electronics and Broadcast), Industrial Design, Mechanical, Structural, and Arts and Sciences. A general College Preparatory curriculum was added later.

Principal Pabst retired in 1964. A railroad club was established by the late Vincent Gorman, a social studies teacher, and students attended fan trips, tours of rail repair facilities and participated in the restoration of steam engine #103 and a historic rail passenger car at the former Empire State Railroad Museum. In August 1965, a ten-year-old boy named Carl Johnson drowned in the swimming pool at Brooklyn Tech while swimming with his day-camp group. The next year, more than 30 graduating Seniors in the school (including many student leaders) complained that Tech&#x27;s curriculum was old and outdated. Their primary complaint was that the curriculum was geared toward the small minority of students who were not planning on attending college. In 1967, the schools of New York City got to view television in the classrooms for the first time, thanks to the 420-foot WNYE-TV tower atop Brooklyn Tech.

For the school year beginning in the last half of 1970, young women began attending; all three NYC specialized and test-required science high schools were now coeducational.

===Incorporation into specialized high school system and later years===
In 1972, Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, Stuyvesant High School, and High School for Performing Arts become incorporated by the New York State Legislature as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant. The exam would become known as the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) and tested students in Math and English. With its statewide recognition, the school had to become co-educational. Previous to this, Brooklyn Tech was All Boys, and had a sister school, Bay Ridge High School which was all girls.

In 1973, Tech celebrated its 50th anniversary with a dinner-dance at the Waldorf Astoria. To further commemorate the anniversary, a monument was erected, with a time capsule beneath it, in the north courtyard. The monument has eight panels, each with a unique design representing each of Tech&#x27;s eight majors at that point.

In 1983, Matt Mandery&#x27;s appointment as principal made him the first Tech alumnus to hold that position. The same year, Tech received the Excellence in Education award from the U.S. Department of Education. The Alumni Association was formally created during this time, and coalitions were formed with the New York City Department of Transportation. Mandery oversaw the addition of a Bio-Medical major to the curriculum. John Tobin followed as principal in 1987, abolished the Materials Science department, and closed the seventh-floor foundry.

In the mid-1980s, a violent street gang known as the Decepticons were founded at Brooklyn Tech. As well, in 2000, the city issued a special report concerning the lack of notification to law enforcement during a string of robberies within the high school, including armed robbery with knives and stun guns.

===Recent years===
In March 1998, an alumni group led by Leonard Riggio, class of 1958, announced plans for a fund-raising campaign to raise $10 million to support their alma mater financially through facilities upgrades, the establishment of curriculum enhancements, faculty training, and a university-type endowment. The endowment fundraiser, the first of its kind for an American public school, received front-page attention in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and sparked a friendly competition amongst the specialized high schools, with both Bronx Science and Stuyvesant announcing their own $10 million campaigns within weeks of the Brooklyn Tech announcement. In November 2005, the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Association announced the completion of the fundraising phase of what they had termed the Campaign for Brooklyn Tech. In April 2008, the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation launched a second endowment campaign.

Sixteen alumni died in the September 11 attacks in 2001. They are Dennis Cross &#x27;59, Ronald F. Orsini &#x27;60, Joel Miller &#x27;63, Sheldon R. Kanter &#x27;66, Stephen Johnson &#x27;75, Danny Libretti &#x27;76, Dominick E. Calia &#x27;79, Dipti Patel &#x27;81, Andre Fletcher &#x27;82, Courtney W. Walcott &#x27;82, Gerard Jean Baptiste &#x27;83, Wai C. Chung &#x27;84, Paul Innella &#x27;85, Michael McDonnell &#x27;85, Thomas Tong &#x27;87, and Paul Ortiz &#x27;98.

Since 2001, Brooklyn Tech has undergone refurbishing such as the renovation of the school&#x27;s William L. Mack Library entrance, located on the fifth-floor center section. As well, two computer labs were added. The school also reinstated a class devoted to the study of Shakespeare, which students can elect to take in their senior year.

====Lee McCaskill====
Dr. Lee D. McCaskill, the appointed principal in 1992, served for 14 years, during which Tech saw the installation of more computer classrooms and the switch from the traditional mechanical drawing by hand to teaching the use of computer-aided design programs.

In 2000, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the NYC School District wrote a report condemning Brooklyn Technical High School administrators for failing to report several armed robberies that took place in the bathrooms and stairwells.

In 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an investigative article that noted &quot;longstanding tensions&quot; between the faculty and Principal McCaskill, &quot;spilled into the open in October, with news reports that several teachers accused him of repeatedly sending sexually explicit e-mail messages from his school computer to staff members.&quot; While the article praised him for his addition of music and sports programs, it mostly described the principal as autocratic, controlling the school &quot;largely through fear and intimidation,&quot; and documented acts of personal vindictiveness toward teachers; severe censorship of the student newspaper and of assigned English texts, including the refusal to let the Pulitzer Prize-finalist novel &quot;Continental Drift&quot; by Russell Banks be used for a class; and of bureaucratic mismanagement. A follow-up column in 2004 found that there was increased teacher exodus, specifically documenting Principal McCaskill&#x27;s campaign against Alice Alcala, who described as one of the city&#x27;s leading Shakespeare teachers. Alcala had won Brooklyn Tech a $10,000 grant and brought in the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain for student workshops, but after Alcala had done so, McCaskill repeatedly denied her access to the auditorium and gave her low performance rankings. Shortly after, Alcala left for Manhattan&#x27;s Murry Bergtraum High School, where she brought in $1,800 in grants for Shakespeare education; meanwhile, at Brooklyn Tech, there was no longer any course solely devoted to Shakespeare, according to the column.

In two newspaper articles in 2005, it was revealed that a $10,000 grant obtained by Dr. Sylvia Weinberger in 2001 to refurbish the obsolete radio studio remained unused. New classroom computers were covered in plastic rather than installed because the classrooms had yet to be wired for them.

The Office of Special Investigations of the New York City Department of Education launched an investigation of McCaskill on February 2, 2006, concerning unpaid enrollment of New Jersey resident McCaskill&#x27;s daughter in a New York City public school, which is illegal for non-residents of the city. Dr. McCaskill produced a lease claiming that he rented an apartment in Brooklyn, but the copyright date on the lease was after the signatures were dated. On February 6, McCaskill announced his resignation from Brooklyn Tech and agreed to pay $19,441 in restitution.

A week later special commissioner Richard J. Condon rebuked the Department of Education for allowing McCaskill to retire, still collecting $125,282 in accrued vacation time, just days before the OSI completed its investigation. Condon also recommended that Cathy Furman McCaskill, the principal&#x27;s wife, be dismissed from her position as a teacher at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn for her part in submitting fake leases and other fraudulent documents to indicate the family lived in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn. The next day, the Department of Education announced that it would fire her. After retiring from Brooklyn Tech, McCaskill became principal of Hillside High School in New Jersey, where in 2013, he resigned following accusations he spanked a female student.

==== Randy Asher ====
On February 7, 2006, the Department of Education named Randy Asher, founding principal of the High School for Math, Science and Engineering (HSMSE), as interim acting principal. Asher had previously served as Brooklyn Tech&#x27;s assistant principal in mathematics from 2000 to 2002 before leaving to become founding principal of HSMSE. During his time as principal, the total student enrollment increased from 4,200 to 5,700. In the beginning of January 2017, Asher abruptly left Tech to take on a new position as an NYC Education Department senior advisor to help reduce the Absent Teacher Reserve. Throughout Asher&#x27;s tenure, the school&#x27;s reputation was sullied by several allegations of sexual harassment and assault of students by faculty members, resulting in the termination of Sean Shaynak (an aerospace engineering teacher hired by Asher) and the reassignment of English teacher and school newspaper advisor David Lo. The school was also rocked by allegations of racism against black students and Asher faced mounting student pressure on social media to fix the situation. Following Asher&#x27;s departure, former assistant principal David Newman took on the new position as acting principal of the specialized high school. In February 2020, Newman was appointed principal.

==Building and facilities==


The school, built on its present site in 1932 at a cost of $6 million, is 12 stories high, and covers over half a city block. Brooklyn Technical High School is directly across the street from Fort Greene Park. Facilities at Brooklyn Tech include:

*Gymnasia on the first and eighth floors, with a mezzanine running track above the larger first floor gym and a weight room in the third floor boys locker room. The eighth floor gym had a bowling alley lane and an adjacent wire-mesh enclosed rooftop sometimes used for handball, golf and for tennis practice.
*25-yard swimming pool in the basement
*Wood, machine, sheet metal and other specialized shops. A program involves a shop where an actual house is built and framed by students. Most have been converted into normal classrooms or computer labs, except for a few robotics shops, such as the Ike Heller Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Robotics Center.
*A foundry on the seventh floor, with a floor of molding sand used for creating sand casting molds and equipped with furnaces, kilns, ovens and ancillary equipment for metal smelting. Students made wooden patterns in pattern making, which were used to make sand molds which were cast in the foundry and machined to specification in the machine shops. It was closed in the late 1980s.
*Materials testing lab, used during the basic materials science (Strength of Materials) class. Included industrial capacity Universal Testing Machine and brinell hardness tester and polishing and microscopic examination rooms. During the 1960s, students attended &quot;inspection training shop&quot; and were taught to use x-ray analysis to detect metal fatigue failures, use of vernier measuring instruments, micrometers, and go-no-go gauges.
*Aeronautical lab, featuring a large wind tunnel, During the 1960s, a T-6 Texan U.S. Air Force surplus aircraft in the building was used for student aeronautical mechanic instruction.
*Radio studio and 18,000 watt transmitter licensed by the Federal Communications Commission as WNYE (FM). The studio has not been used since the 1980s.
*3,100-seat auditorium, with two balconies—the 4th largest auditorium in New York City
*Recital hall on the ninth floor
*Drafting, both pencil and ink technical drawing and freehand drawing rooms
*Library with defunct fireplaces
*Football field on Fulton and Clermont Streets. The Football Field, named in honor of Brooklyn Tech Alumnus Charles Wang, was opened in 2001, with the home opener played October 6, 2001, against DeWitt Clinton High School.
*Access to Fort Greene Park for outdoor track, tennis, etc.
*Mock courtroom for use by the Law &amp; Society major and the Mock Trial Team.
*The 420-foot WNYE-FM tower atop the school is three times taller than the building. The entire structure combined is {{convert|597|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall. It was the tallest structure in Brooklyn, beating out AVA DoBro by only one foot, but beaten in 2017 with the completion of The Hub, which is 13 feet taller.
*In 1934, the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), which later became the Works Projects Administration (WPA), commissioned artist Maxwell B. Starr to paint a mural in the foyer depicting the evolution of man and science throughout history.

==Transportation==
The New York City Subway&#x27;s Fulton Street ({{NYCS trains|Crosstown}}) and Lafayette Avenue ({{NYCS trains|Fulton local day}}) stations are located nearby, as well as more BMT and IRT services at DeKalb Avenue and Atlantic Terminal, which also serves the Long Island Rail Road. Additionally, New York City Bus&#x27;s {{NYC bus link|B25|B26|B38}} and {{NYC bus link|B52}} routes stop near Brooklyn Tech.

Students are placed into a major during the second semester of their sophomore year after ranking all the majors in order of preference. These majors include courses, typically Advanced Placement or Project Lead the Way (PLTW) courses, that concentrate in that specific area of interest given to students during their last two years at Tech. Each major has a different formula (PI index) used to rank students according to their ranking preference of the majors and their current averages from freshman and sophomore year. A student with a higher PI index for their second preference if they did not get into their first, will get priority over another student with a lower average on the same major preference.

Bret Stephens, an opinion columnist, wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;The success of Brooklyn Tech only casts an unflattering light on every other corner of the public school bureaucracy.&quot;

==Extracurricular activities==
Brooklyn Tech fields 30 junior-varsity and varsity teams in the Public School Athletic League (PSAL). The school&#x27;s historic team name has been the Engineers. The school colors are navy blue and white. The school&#x27;s more than 100 organizations include the Brooklyn Tech Amateur Radio Club (club station call sign W2CXN), Civil Air Patrol Brooklyn Tech Cadet Squadron, chess, debate, football, wrestling, forensics (speech), hockey, mock trial, robotics, and rowing teams and clubs, and The Survey, the official school newspaper. Tech has a literary art journal, Horizons, for those who want to express themselves through art, poetry, photography, and prose. The Model United Nations provides students with a venue for discussing foreign affairs and also hosts a conference each year called TechMUN. Other clubs cater to a wide range of topics such as public transportation (notably &quot;Tech Transit Association&quot;, the school&#x27;s first of such clubs since 1964), anime, the Stock Market, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, ultimate Frisbee, politics, quilting, fashion, debate (which offers Public Forum, Congress and Policy), table tennis and animal rights. The cheerleading squad is named the Enginettes. In 2012, Tech students created a Junior State of America Chapter at their school. Brooklyn Tech has its own student union, to address issues on a student level. Tech has a variety of community service clubs, such as Key Club, Red Cross Club, and BETA. Tech students put on a play each fall, and a musical each spring.

There are two step teams, Lady Dragons and Organized C.H.A.O.S.

The school has several Coordinators of Student Activities (COSA).

==In popular culture==
The Brooklyn Tech Cheerleading Squad appeared in the 1988 Spike Lee film &quot;School Daze&quot;, and a video for the movie, entitled &quot;Da Butt&quot;, was shot at Brooklyn Tech.

Lee also used the first floor gymnasium as a shooting location for Jesus Shuttlesworth&#x27;s, played by Ray Allen, Sportscenter preview in &quot;He Got Game&quot;.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}.

School interiors for the pilot episode of the 2013 series &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; were filmed in Brooklyn Tech. (Subsequent episodes were filmed in Vancouver rather than New York City.)

Brooklyn Tech was also used to film the FOX series &quot;Gotham&quot;.

The Netflix series Grand Army is also loosely based on Brooklyn Tech.

<text>The Dorpat Voivodeship ( or &quot;województwo derpskie&quot;) was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Duchy of Livonia, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, from 1598 until the Swedish conquest of Livonia in the 1620s. The seat of the voivode was in the town of Dorpat (Tartu), while the regional assembly (sejmik) for the whole province of Livonia was located in Wenden. The area of the Dorpat Voivodeship was app. 9,000 square kilometers, and it had two senators in the Senate of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The voivodeship was created by King Zygmunt III Waza in 1598, out of the Dorpat Presidency, which had existed since the Truce of Jam Zapolski (1582). It was divided into five districts:
*district (starostwo) of Dorpat (&quot;Tartu&quot;)
*district (starostwo) of Oberpahlen (&quot;Põltsamaa&quot;)
*district (starostwo) of Lais (&quot;Laiuse&quot;)
*district (starostwo) of Kirrumpah (&quot;Kirumpää&quot;)
*district (starostwo) of Neuhausen (&quot;Vastseliina&quot;)

It effectively ceased to exist in 1621, when northern Livonia was conquered by the Swedish Empire, and turned into Swedish Livonia (see also Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629)). Officially, the Dorpat Voivodeship was liquidated in 1660, following the Treaty of Oliva. Nevertheless, the title of Voivode of Dorpat was kept until the Partitions of Poland, as the so-called &quot;fictitious title&quot; ().

<doc id="378890" wikidata="Q6467371" url="?curid=378890" title="LabourStart">
<text>LabourStart is the news and campaigning website of the international trade union movement. It distributes news both via its own website and also through a news syndication service (in both RSS and JavaScript formats) which is used by trade union websites around the world. There are newswires for specific languages, countries, regions, and some US states and every Canadian province. There are special newswires for online campaigns, women&#x27;s labour news, and even a Health and Safety NewsWire run jointly with Hazards. The site has 638,000 unique visits per month as of February 2012.

News links are collected by a network of nearly 960 volunteer correspondents and appear in 27 languages.

==History==
LabourStart was founded in March 1998 as part of the website launched in 1996 by Eric Lee in order to provide updates to his book, The Labour Movement and the Internet: The New Internationalism. The LabourStart website was initially hosted by Solinet, the website of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and its editor was based in Israel, on Kibbutz Ein Dor. In June 1998, Lee moved to London and the site has been based in Britain ever since.

From 1998 through 2002, LabourStart was a project of Labour and Society International (LSI), a non-governmental organisation based in London and initially headed up by Arthur Lipow, Stirling Smith and David Clement. At the end of 2002, LSI ceased functioning and LabourStart became entirely independent. At the same time, a number of LabourStart correspondents met up for the first time in London and have continued to meet online ever since. A number of correspondents have been named as Senior Correspondents and they, together with founding editor Lee, ran the project on a day by day basis until a recent re-organization.

In 2001 LabourStart expanded its news service to include news in other languages.

==Governance==

Until September 2015 LabourStart was administered informally by a self-selected group of Senior Correspondents. Generally these were people active in the labour movements of their home countries. The selection criteria were never formalized but most were full-time trade union officials, either appointed or elected. Efforts were made to select Senior Correspondents in order to expand LabourStart&#x27;s footprint in various countries but these were mostly unsuccessful. Readership and campaigns participation remained largely confined to Europe, North America and Australia.

In order to address this ongoing problem and other structural issues an invitation-only retreat was held in September 2015 in Brussels. The retreat was meant to respond to complaints about a lack of transparency in regard to LabourStart&#x27;s operations and finances, the chaotic nature of decision-making, the need to become a truly global organization, and the need for succession planning as many of the organization&#x27;s volunteers, including its founder, are now in their late 50s or 60s.

The retreat resulted in the creation of an Executive Committee with formal decision-making authority and a number of issue-specific working groups. Steps were also taken to move toward equal gender representation within LabourStart&#x27;s leadship but women remain in a minority.

==Campaign Work==
Central to LabourStart&#x27;s efforts are its multilingual mailing lists, which started with around 500 names in 1998 and within four years had grown more than sixfold to 3,227 names. Five years later, it had grown even more, and by June 2007 there were more than 53,000 subscribers to the weekly newsletter. By April 2012, there were just under 100,000 names on the lists. The mailing lists are used by LabourStart primarily to promote its online campaigns in support of workers&#x27; rights around the world.

As of November 2015 the various mailing lists are as follows:
* English: 85,588
* French: 8,325
* German: 5,785
* Spanish: 5,448
* Italian: 3,970
* Turkish: 3,719
* Korean: 3,068
* Norwegian: 2,782
* Russian: 2,433
* Dutch: 1,774
* Swedish: 1,256
* Chinese: 1,103
* Polish: 793
* Finnish: 687
* Japanese: 488
* Arabic: 463
* Portuguese: 416
* Indonesian: 346
* Hebrew: 282
* Tagalog: 254
* Farsi: 242

Social networks also play a role in LabourStart&#x27;s news distribution and campaigning services. It has focussed its efforts on Facebook and Twitter and has a larger following than many national trade union centres.

Twitter followers:
* Global English: 15,395
* Canada English: 4,962

In recent years, LabourStart has conducted dozens of global online campaigns on behalf of unions. These campaigns have led in many cases to companies and governments being compelled to release jailed trade unionists, to negotiate with unions, and so on. Examples of recent LabourStart online campaigns call on the Egyptian government to overturn the jail sentence for Kamal Abbas and on the government of Iran to not execute jailed trade unionist and university teacher Abdolreza Ghanbari. These campaigns are initiatives of the International Trade Union Confederation and the Education International with which LabourStart has an ongoing partnership in promoting workers&#x27; rights through online campaigns.

LabourStart campaigns are sponsored or endorsed by a trade union or global union federation. LabourStart&#x27;s campaign services are provided to unions at no charge.

It is not unknown for an online action mounted by LabourStart to exceed 20,000 participants within a week but the norm is around 10,000. Nation-specific campaigns may see as little as a few hundred participants or as many as 10,000, depending in part on the issue and on the population of the relevant country (Canada and the United Kingdom are the two most common single-country campaign sources).

==Global Solidarity Conferences==
LabourStart holds annual Global Solidarity Conferences. Following small international meetings in London and Washington DC in 2008 and 2009, major events were held in Hamilton, Ontario in 2010, Istanbul in 2011, Sydney, Australia (2012), Berlin, Germany (2014) and Toronto, Canada (2016).

==UnionBook==
In 2010 LabourStart launched UnionBook, a social network for trade unionists. It runs on the Ning platform. By March 2012 it had just over 5,000 members. By 2015 membership in UnionBook had stabilized at just over 6,000 and the site had become a forum for a small number of users with extreme or repetitive views. At a meeting of the LabourStart Executive Committee in Brussels in September 2015 the decision was made to offer the site as-is to any interested union or group of trade unionists. As of October 2015 references to LabourStart as the &#x27;owner&#x27; of UnionBook were removed from the site. As of January 2016 there had been no offers to assume responsibility for the site and it appears likely that it will simply be shut down.

==Educational Activities==
LabourStart volunteers regularly conduct workshops on the organizing potential of the new media for unions. These workshops are often organized at the request of a specific union or central labour body but LabourStart volunteers also often play key roles in organizing union-tech events such as the LabourTech conferences in Canada. It has also provided hands-on technical assistance to unions moving onto the &#x27;net but the demand for this service has declined rapidly since most unions of any size are now well-established online. One of the first evaluations of the then-new Facebook for trade union organizing purposes was conducted by a team of LabourStart volunteers based in Canada and the UK in 2007, well before Facebook was widely known or popular outside university student circles.

==Controversies==

LabourStart has been criticized by some in the digital labour movement including Walton Pantland of Cyberunions for continuing to rely on e-mail as the &#x27;killer app&#x27; for online campaigning into the foreseeable future. These critics tend to see the e-mail-based tactics used by LabourStart as dated and not reflective of the move to smartphones as the primary devices for accessing the internet by trade unionists, especially in the global south. In response LabourStart has relied on its analyses of the weaknesses of alternative platforms, in particular the question of who owns or controls those alternative platforms .

As all of LabourStart global and national leadership figures are active within global, national or local trade unions they often take positions publicly. These are then sometimes attributed to LabourStart. Attempts are made by LabourStart to explain that it acts at the request of the existing structures of the global labour movement and that its volunteers are not subject to organizational discipline . But attacks on LabourStart, including calls for boycotts of the site and its campaigns , resulting from a position taken by one of its high-profile volunteers are regular if not frequent occurrences.

Similarly, disputes within and amongst LabourStart volunteers that reflect the differing positions of the unions and political factions from which they are drawn are regular occurrences. The Canadian and Dutch sections have, for example, clashed over whether a confessional trade union, one that is explicitly affiliated with an organized religion or church, can be considered a legitimate trade union. Issues like these are fundamental to what LabourStart does as the question of legitimacy determines whether a trade union is able to access LabourStart&#x27;s services and whether persons affiliated with it may move into senior leadership positions within LabourStart.

LabourStart is regularly subject to criticism for its lack of a footprint in Latin America, large parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa outside South Africa.

==Reception==

Other labour organisations and news sources treat LabourStart as a known and serious campaigning organisation. Thus ITFGlobal has &quot;LabourStart appeal backs Estonian activist sacked for speaking out&quot;; Solidarity Center has &quot;LabourStart Campaign. Peruvian Union Leader Fired after Speaking out against Poor Working Conditions&quot;; Workers&#x27; Liberty has &quot;Forging global solidarity&quot;, a report on LabourStart&#x27;s 2014 Berlin conference; similarly Red Pepper has &quot;Labourstart Global Solidarity Conference opens this Friday in Berlin&quot;. The Labor Hall of Fame reports on a series of LabourStart activities. Trades Unions across the world likewise rely on LabourStart services and report on LabourStart campaigns, thus European Federation of Public Service Unions reports on &quot;Labourstart campaign to support sacked workers Istanbul Hospital - please sign&quot;. The Canadian GoUnion has a &quot;partners and allies&quot; page about LabourStart with a history of the organisation. Industri all reports on LabourStart&#x27;s campaign at Rio Tinto. Justice for Colombia has &quot;LabourStart Launches Colombia Petition&quot;.

LabourStart received the prestigious Arthur Svensson International Prize for Trade Union Rights in 2016.

<text>The president of Georgia () is the ceremonial head of state of Georgia as well as the commander-in-chief of the Defence Forces. The constitution defines the presidential office as &quot;the guarantor of the country&#x27;s unity and national independence.&quot;

The president is largely a figurehead as in many parliamentary democracies but does retain some significant authorities, such as the right to issue pardons. Executive power is vested in the Government and the prime minister. The office was first introduced by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia on 14 April 1991, five days after Georgia&#x27;s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. The president serves a five-year term.

On 14 December 2024, the Electoral Assembly elected Mikheil Kavelashvili as the new president and inaugurated him on 29 December 2024. It was the first indirect election of the president in Georgia&#x27;s history after the constitutional amendments changed the electoral system in 2017. Opposition parties, Georgian constitutional experts, as well as parts of the international community consider Kavelashvili&#x27;s presidency illegitimate and maintain that Salome Zourabichvili continues to be the president. 

== Qualifications ==
Any citizen of Georgia having the electoral right, who has attained the age of 35 and who has lived in Georgia for at least 15 years, may be elected President of Georgia. The office cannot be held by a citizen of Georgia who is simultaneously the citizen of a foreign country. The president of Georgia shall not be a member of a political party.

== Election ==
According to the 2018 version of Georgia&#x27;s constitution, starting in 2024, the president is elected for a five-year term by the 300-member Electoral College, consisting of all members of the Parliament of Georgia and of the supreme representative bodies of the autonomous republics of Abkhazia and Adjara, also members from the representative bodies of local self-governments (municipalities). The same person may be elected President of Georgia only twice. No less than 30 members of the Electoral College shall have the right to nominate a candidate for the president of Georgia. The election of the president of Georgia is appointed by the Parliament for October.

== Impeachment ==
One third of the total number of the members of Parliament has the right to raise the question of impeachment of the president of Georgia. They can be considered impeached if the decision is supported by at least two thirds of the members of Parliament. The procedure of the impeachment of the president is constitutionally banned during a state of emergency or martial law.

== Constitutional powers and duties ==
1. The President of Georgia shall:

a) with the consent of the Government, exercise representative powers in foreign relations, negotiate with other states and international organisations, conclude international treaties, and accept the accreditation of ambassadors and other diplomatic representatives of other states and international organisations; upon nomination by the Government, appoint and dismiss ambassadors and other heads of diplomatic missions of Georgia;

b) conclude a constitutional agreement with the Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Georgia on behalf of the state of Georgia;

c) call the elections of Parliament and local self-government bodies in accordance with the Constitution and the procedures established by the organic law;

d) upon nomination by the Government, appoint and dismiss the Commander of the Defence Forces of Georgia; appoint one member of the High Council of Justice; participate in the appointment of the chairperson and members of the Central Election Commission of Georgia in cases defined by the organic law and in accordance with the established procedure; upon nomination by the Government, submit to Parliament candidates for the membership of the national regulatory bodies;

e) decide on citizenship issues in accordance with the procedures established by the organic law;

f) pardon convicts;

g) in accordance with the procedures established by law, grant state awards and rewards; highest military ranks, special ranks and honorary titles; and highest diplomatic ranks;

i) exercise other powers determined by the Constitution.

2. The President of Georgia shall have the right to call a referendum on issues defined in the Constitution and law, at the request of the Parliament of Georgia, the Government of Georgia or no less than 200 000 voters, within 30 days after such a request is received. A referendum shall not be held in order to adopt or repeal a law, to grant amnesty or pardon, to ratify or denounce international treaties, or to decide issues that envisage the restriction of fundamental constitutional human rights. Issues related to calling and holding referendums shall be defined by the organic law.

3. The President of Georgia shall have the right to address the people. The President shall annually submit a report on crucial state-related issues to Parliament.

== Oath ==
Prior to assuming office, on the third Sunday after the election day, the newly elected president of Georgia addresses the people and is required to take the following oath of office:

== Immunity ==
The president of Georgia enjoys immunity. No one shall have the right to detain or bring criminal proceedings against the president of Georgia while in office. Security of the president of Georgia is provided by the Special State Protection Service.

==Standard==
The standard is adapted from the national flag of Georgia, charged in the center with the Georgian coat of arms. Copies of the standard are used inside the president&#x27;s office, at the Chancellery Building, other state agencies, and as a car flag on vehicles bearing the president within Georgian territory.

==History of office==

After Georgia formally seceded from the Soviet Union on 9 April 1991, the Supreme Council voted, on 14 April, to create the post of executive president, and appointed Zviad Gamsakhurdia to the office pending the holding of direct elections. In the nationwide elections to this post, on 26 May 1991, Gamsakhurdia won a landslide victory, becoming the first president of the Republic of Georgia. Gamsakhurdia was ousted in a military coup d&#x27;état on 6 January 1992. He continued to function as a president-in-exile until his death in a failed attempt to regain power on 31 December 1993.

In the post-coup absence of legitimate power, a position of the head of state was introduced for Georgia&#x27;s new leader Eduard Shevardnadze on 10 March 1992. After the adoption of a new Constitution on 24 August 1995, the post of president was restored. Shevardnadze was elected to presidency on 5 November 1995, and reelected on 9 April 2000. He resigned under pressure of mass demonstrations known as Rose Revolution on 23 November 2003. After Nino Burjanadze&#x27;s brief tenure as an acting president, Mikheil Saakashvili was elected on 4 January 2004. He did not serve his full first term, but voluntarily resigned to defuse tensions in the aftermath of the 2007 Georgian demonstrations and brought the presidential elections forward from the original date in autumn 2008. He was reelected on 5 January 2008. The president&#x27;s executive powers were significantly curtailed in favor of the prime minister and the government in a series of amendments passed between 2013 and 2018. After the election of Giorgi Margvelashvili to presidency in October 2013, Georgia finalized its transition to a parliamentary republic. In November 2018, Salome Zourabichvili, became Georgia&#x27;s first female president in permanent capacity and, according to the new constitution, the last president to be elected by a direct vote.

===2024 succession dispute===
On 13 February 2025, the European Parliament passed a resolution stating that the European Union does not recognize Mikheil Kavelashvili as the legitimate president of Georgia.

==Succession and acting president==

In the event of the president&#x27;s resignation, death or impeachment, the chairperson of Parliament will temporarily serve as president until a new president is elected. There were cases of this in Georgia in 2003 and 2007, in both cases, the president resigned prematurely and was replaced by the chairperson of parliament, before new elections were held. In both cases, the then-chairperson Nino Burjanadze became acting president, so it can be said that she became the first female president of the country. However, the first female president of Georgia who was actually elected in her own right is Salome Zourabichvili.

==Administration==
Administration of the President of Georgia (, sometimes translated as Presidential Administration of Georgia) is the body supporting and organizing the exercise of the powers defined by the Constitution of Georgia and other legislative acts for the President of Georgia. The Administration of the President of Georgia was established on February 14, 2004 by the Decree No.60 of the President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili. In its activities, the administration is guided by the Constitution of Georgia, the legislation of Georgia, the statute and other legal acts of the President of Georgia. The structure and rules of operation of the administration are determined by the President of Georgia.

<doc id="378905" wikidata="Q185003" url="?curid=378905" title="Jew's harp">
<text>The Jew&#x27;s harp, also known as jaw harp, juice harp, or mouth harp, is a lamellophone instrument, consisting of a flexible metal or bamboo tongue or reed attached to a frame. Despite the colloquial name, the Jew&#x27;s harp most likely originated in Siberia, specifically in or around the Altai Mountains, and is of Turkic origin. It has no relation to the Jewish people.

Jew&#x27;s harps may be categorized as idioglot or heteroglot (whether or not the frame and the tine are one piece); by the shape of the frame (rod or plaque); by the number of tines, and whether the tines are plucked, joint-tapped, or string-pulled.

==Characteristics==
The frame is held firmly against the performer&#x27;s parted teeth or lips (depending on the type), using the mouth (plus the throat and lungs when breathing freely) as a resonator, greatly increasing the volume of the instrument. The teeth must be parted sufficiently for the reed to vibrate freely, and the fleshy parts of the mouth should not come into contact with the reed to prevent damping of the vibrations and possible pain. The note or tone thus produced is constant in pitch, though by changing the shape of the mouth, and the amount of air contained in it (and in some traditions closing the glottis), the performer can cause different overtones to sound and thus create melodies.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, &quot;The vibrations of the steel tongue produce a compound sound composed of a fundamental and its harmonics. By using the cavity of the mouth as a resonator, each harmonic in succession can be isolated and reinforced, giving the instrument the compass shown.&quot;

&quot;The lower harmonics of the series cannot be obtained, owing to the limited capacity of the resonating cavity. The black notes on the stave show the scale which may be produced by using two harps, one tuned a fourth above the other. The player on the Jew&#x27;s harp, in order to isolate the harmonics, frames his mouth as though intending to pronounce the various vowels.&quot; See: bugle scale.

==History==

Jaw harps have been discovered in Shaanxi, China, dating back about 4000 years ago. The earliest depiction of somebody playing what seems to be a Jew&#x27;s harp is a Chinese drawing from the 3rd century BCE. Archaeological finds of surviving examples in Europe have been claimed to be almost as old, but those dates have been challenged both on the grounds of excavation techniques, and the lack of contemporary writing or pictures mentioning the instrument.

==Etymology==
There are many theories for the origin of the name &quot;jew&#x27;s harp&quot;. The apparent reference to Jewish people is especially misleading since it &quot;has nothing to do with the Jewish people; neither does it look like a harp in its structure and appearance&quot;. In Sicilian it is translated as or ; both of which are derogatory terms for Jewish people also found in Italian and Spanish. In German, it is known as , which translates directly to &#x27;mouth drum&#x27;. The name &quot;Jew&#x27;s Harp&quot; first appears in 1481 in a customs account book under the name &quot;Jue harpes&quot;. The &quot;jaw&quot; variant is attested at least as early as 1774 and 1809, the &quot;juice&quot; variant appearing only in the late 19th and 20th centuries.

It has also been suggested that the name derives from the French meaning &#x27;toy trumpet&#x27;. The current French word for the instrument is . English etymologist Hensleigh Wedgwood wrote in 1855 that the derivation from opposes the French idiom, where &quot;if two substantives are joined together, the qualifying noun is invariably the last&quot;. He refers to the derivation, but not to the derivation.

Both theories—that the name is a corruption of &quot;jaws&quot; or —are described by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as &quot;lacking any supporting evidence.&quot; The OED says that, &quot;more or less satisfactory reasons may be conjectured: e.g., that the instrument was actually made, sold, or imported to England by Jewish people, or purported to be so; or that it was attributed to Jewish people, suggesting the trumps and harps mentioned in the Bible, and hence considered a good commercial name.&quot; Although the OED states that &quot;the association of the instrument with Jewish people occurs, so far as is known, only in English&quot;, the term is also used in Danish.

== Manufacture ==
=== Manufacture of Indian morchang ===
Indian morchangs are made in many metals but mainly in brass, iron, copper and silver. Different types of construction art are used for the construction of Morchang in each metal.
==== Brass ====

Brass murchangs are manufactured from ancient Indian manufacturing style brass metal casting. Brass molding is a process of shaping brass, into desired shapes using a mold. The brass is heated to a molten state and then poured or forced into the mold, where it cools and solidifies into the desired shape. Brass molding is often used to create intricate or complex shapes.

==Use==


===Cambodian music===
The angkuoch (Khmer: ) is a Cambodian Jew&#x27;s harp. It is a folk instrument made of bamboo and carved into a long, flat shape with a hole in the center and the tongue across the hole. There is also a metal variety, more round or tree-leaf shaped. It may also have metal bells attached. The instrument is both a wind instrument and percussion instrument. As a wind instrument, it is placed against the mouth, which acts as a resonator and tool to alter the sound. Although mainly a folk instrument, better-made examples exist. While the instrument was thought to be the invention of children herding cattle, it is sometimes used in public performance, to accompany the Mahori music in public dancing.

===Indian music===
The instrument is used as part of the rhythm section in various styles of Indian folk and classical music. Most notably the Morsing in the Carnatic music of South India, or the &quot;Morchang&quot; in the folk music of Rajasthan.

===Russian music===
In Russia, the instrument has its own brand called &quot;vargan&quot;. A Jew&#x27;s harp was excavated in a 9th-century burial mound in Idelbayev, Bashkortostan.
The Jew&#x27;s harp was banned in the USSR during the regime of Joseph Stalin due to its closeness to Shamanism.

===Nepali tradition===
====Murchunga====

In Nepal, one type of Jew&#x27;s harp is named the (Nepali: ). It is very similar to an Indian &quot;morsing&quot; or &quot;morchang&quot; in that the tongue (or twanger) extends beyond the frame, thus giving the instrument more sustain.

====Binayo====
The (Nepali ) is a bamboo Jew&#x27;s harp, in the Kiranti musical tradition from Malingo. It is popular in the Eastern Himalayan region of Nepal, Sikkim, Darjeeling, and Bhutan. It is a wind instrument played by blowing the air without tuning the node with fingers. The is six inches long and one inch in width.

===Turkic traditional music===
====Kyrgyz music====
The &quot;temir komuz&quot; is made of iron, usually with a length of 100–200 mm and with a width of approximately 2–7 mm. The range of the instrument varies with the size of the instrument but generally hovers around an octave span. The Kyrgyz people are exceptionally proficient on the instrument and it is quite popular among children, although some adults continue to play the instrument. &quot;Temir komuz&quot; pieces were notated by Aleksandr Zataevich in two or three parts. An octave drone is possible, or even an ostinato alternating the fifth step of a scale with an octave.

==== Turkish music ====
In Turkish, the Jew&#x27;s harp is called as ağız kopuzu. The Jew&#x27;s harp traditionally used in Turkish folk songs from Anatolia has fallen out of use with time. Modern renditions of Turkish folk songs with the Jew&#x27;s harp have been done by artists such as Senem Diyici in the song &#x27;Dolama Dolamayı&#x27; and Ravan Yuzkhan.

===Sindhi music===
In Sindhi music, the Jew&#x27;s harp is called (). In Sindhi music, it can be an accompaniment or the main instrument. One of the most famous players is Amir Bux Ruunjho.

===Sicilian music===
In Sicily, the Jew&#x27;s harp is commonly known as marranzanu, but other names include angalarruni, calarruni, gangalarruni, ganghilarruni, mariolu, mariolu di fera, marranzana, and ngannalarruni.

===Austrian Jew&#x27;s harp playing===
Austrian Jew&#x27;s harp music uses typical Western harmony. The UNESCO has included Austrian Jew&#x27;s harp playing in its Intangible Cultural Heritage list.

In Austria, the instrument is known as (the literal translation is &#x27;mouth drum&#x27;).

===Western classical music===
Early representations of Jew&#x27;s harps have appeared in Western churches since the fourteenth century.

The Austrian composer Johann Albrechtsberger—chiefly known today as a teacher of Beethoven—wrote seven concerti for Jew&#x27;s harp, mandora, and orchestra between 1769 and 1771. Four of them have survived, in the keys of F major, E-flat major, E major, and D major. They are based on the special use of the Jew&#x27;s harp in Austrian folk music.

Well known performer Franz Koch (1761–1831), discovered by Frederick the Great, could play two Jew&#x27;s harps at once, while the also well known performer Karl Eulenstein (1802–1890) &quot;invented a system of playing four at once, connecting them by silken strings in such a way that he could clasp all four with the lips, and strike all the four springs at the same time&quot;.

The American composer Charles Ives wrote a part for Jew&#x27;s harp in the &quot;Washington&#x27;s Birthday&quot; movement of &quot;A Symphony: New England Holidays.&quot;

===Western music===

The Jew&#x27;s harp has been used occasionally in rock and country music. For example:
* Canned Heat&#x27;s multi-part piece &quot;Parthenogenesis&quot;, from their 1968 studio album, &quot;Living the Blues&quot;.
* Black Sabbath – &quot;Sleeping Village&quot;
* The Who – &quot;Join Together&quot;

<text>In music, call and response is a compositional technique, often a succession of two distinct phrases that works like a conversation in music. One musician offers a phrase, and a second player answers with a direct commentary or response. The phrases can be vocal, instrumental, or both. Additionally, they can take form as commentary to a statement, an answer to a question or repetition of a phrase following or slightly overlapping the initial speaker(s). It corresponds to the call and response pattern in human communication and is found as a basic element of musical form, such as the verse-chorus form, in many traditions.

==By region==
===Africa===
In many African cultures, call and response is a pervasive pattern of democratic participation—in public gatherings in the discussion of civic affairs, in religious rituals, as well as in vocal and instrumental musical expression. Most of the call and response practices found in modern culture originated from many African regions. 

===North America===
Enslaved Africans brought call and response music with them to the colonized American continents and it has been transmitted over the centuries in various forms of cultural expression—in religious observance, public gatherings, sporting events, children&#x27;s rhymes, and most notably, in African-American music in its myriad forms and descendants. These include soul, gospel, blues, rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk, pop, and hip hop. Hear for example the recordings entitled &quot;Negro Folklore from Texas State Prisons&quot; collected by Bruce Jackson on an Electra Records recording. Call and response are widely present in parts of the Americas touched by the trans-Atlantic slave trade. The tradition of call and response fosters dialogue and its legacy continues today, as it is an important component of oral traditions. Both African-American women work songs, African American work songs, and the work song, in general, use the call-and-response format often. It can also be found in the music of the Afro-Caribbean populations of Jamaica, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, and many nations of the diaspora, especially Brazil.

Call and response is extensively used in Cuban music, where it is known as &quot;coro-pregón&quot;. It derives from African musical elements, both in the secular rumba and in African religious ceremonies (Santería).

===South America===

When enslaved African populations were brought to work in coastal agricultural areas of Peru during colonial times, they brought along their musical traditions. In Peru, those traditions mixed with Spanish popular music of the nineteenth century, as well as the indigenous music of Peru, eventually growing into what is commonly known as Afro-Peruvian music. Known as “huachihualo“, and characterized by competitive call-and-response verses, it is the defining trademark of various musical styles in Afro-Peruvian musical culture such as marinera, festejo, landó, tondero, zamacueca, and contrapunto de zapateo

In Colombia, the dance and musical form of &quot;cumbia&quot; originated with the enslaved African population of the coastal region of the country in the late 17th century. The style developed in Colombia from the intermingling of three cultures. From Africa, the drum percussion, foot movements and call-and-response. Its melodies and use of the gaita or caña de millo (cane flute) represents the Native Colombian influence, and the dress represents the Spanish influence.

===United Kingdom===
In 1644, lining out – where one person sang a solo (a precentor) and others followed – is outlined by the Westminster Assembly for psalm singing in English churches. It has influenced popular music singing styles. Presentinge line was characterized a slow, drawn-out heterophonic and often profusely ornamented melody, while a clerk or precentor (song leader) chanted the text line by line before it was sung by the congregation. Scottish Gaelic psalm-singing by prepresentinge line was the earliest form of congregational singing adopted by Africans in America.

Call and response is also a common structure of songs and carols originating in the Middle Ages, for example &quot;All in the Morning&quot; and &quot;Down in yon Forest&quot;, both traditional Derbyshire carols.

Hawaiian Music:
Call and response can be found in Hawaiian Traditional music and still found to this day.

==Classical music==
In Western classical music, call and response is known as antiphony. The &quot;New Grove Dictionary&quot; defines antiphony as &quot;music in which an ensemble is divided into distinct groups, used in opposition, often spatial, and using contrasts of volume, pitch, timbre, etc.&quot; Early examples can be found in the music of Giovanni Gabrieli, one of the renowned practitioners of the Venetian polychoral style:

Gabrieli also contributed many instrumental canzonas, composed for contrasting groups of players: 

Heinrich Schütz was one of the first composers to realise the expressive potential of the polychoral style in his &quot;Little Sacred Concertos&quot;. The best known of these works is &quot;Saul, Saul, was verfolgst du mich?&quot;, a vivid setting of the narrative of the Conversion of Paul as told in Acts 9 verses 3-4: &quot;And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?&quot;

&quot;The musical phrase on which most of the concerto is built is sounded immediately by a pair of basses&quot;: 

This idea is &quot;then taken up by the alto and tenor, then by the sopranos, and finally by the pair of violins as transition to the explosive tutti&quot;: 

&quot;The syncopated repetitions of the name Saul are strategically planted so that, when the whole ensemble takes them up, they can be augmented into hockets resounding back and forth between the choirs, adding to the impression of an enveloping space And achieving in sound something like the effect of the surrounding light described by the Apostle.&quot;

In the following century, J.S. Bach featured antiphonal exchanges in his St Matthew Passion and the motets. In his motet &quot;Komm, Jesu, komm&quot;, Bach uses eight voices deployed as two antiphonal choirs. According to John Eliot Gardiner, in this 
&quot;intimate and touching&quot; work, Bach “goes many steps beyond the manipulation of spatially separate blocks of sound” and “finds ways of weaving all eight lines into a rich contrapuntal tapestry.”

The development of the classical orchestra in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries exploited the dramatic potential of antiphonal exchanges between groups of instruments. An example can be found in the development section of the finale of Mozart’s Symphony No. 41:

Even terser are the exchanges between wind and strings in the first movement of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony. Here, the development culminates in a &quot;singularly dramatic passage&quot; consisting of a &quot;strange sequence of block harmonies&quot;:

Twentieth century works that feature antiphonal exchanges include the second movement of Béla Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Music for Strings Percussion and Celesta&quot; (1936) and Michael Tippett’s &quot;Concerto for Double String Orchestra&quot; (1938). One spectacular example from the 1950s is Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Gruppen&quot; for Three Orchestras (1955–1957), which culminates in a &quot;synchronized build-up of brass &#x27;points&#x27; in the three orchestras ... leading to a climax of chord exchanges from orchestra to orchestra&quot;. When heard live, this piece creates a genuine sensation of music moving in space. &quot;The combination of the three orchestras leads to great climaxes: long percussion solos, concertante trumpet solos, powerful brass sections, alternating and interpenetrating.&quot;

==Popular music==
Call and response is common in modern Western popular music. Cross-over rhythm and blues, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and rock music exhibit call-and-response characteristics, as well. The Who&#x27;s song &quot;My Generation&quot; is an example:

==Leader/chorus call and response==
A single leader makes a musical statement, and then the chorus responds together. American bluesman Muddy Waters utilizes call and response in one of his signature songs, &quot;Mannish Boy&quot; which is almost entirely leader/chorus call and response.

Another example is from Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;School Day (Ring Ring Goes the Bell)&quot;.

A contemporary example is from Carly Rae Jepsen&#x27;s &quot;Call Me Maybe&quot;.

This technique is utilized in Jepsen&#x27;s song several times. While mostly in the chorus, it can also be heard in the breakdown (approximately 2:25) between the vocals (&quot;It&#x27;s hard to look right&quot;) and distorted guitar.

==Question/answer call and response==
Part of the band poses a musical &quot;question&quot;, or a phrase that feels unfinished, and another part of the band &quot;answers&quot; (finishes) it. In the blues, the B section often has a question-and-answer pattern (dominant-to-tonic).

An example of this is the 1960 Christmas song &quot;Must Be Santa&quot;:
A similar question-and-answer exchange occurs in the 1942 film &quot;Casablanca&quot; between Sam (Dooley Wilson) and the band in the song &quot;Knock On Wood&quot;:

<doc id="378912" wikidata="Q7234712" url="?curid=378912" title="Potassium in biology">
<text>Potassium is the main intracellular ion for all types of cells, while having a major role in maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance. Potassium is necessary for the function of all living cells and is thus present in all plant and animal tissues. It is found in especially high concentrations within plant cells, and in a mixed diet, it is most highly concentrated in fruits. The high concentration of potassium in plants, associated with comparatively very low amounts of sodium there, historically resulted in potassium first being isolated from the ashes of plants (potash), which in turn gave the element its modern name. The high concentration of potassium in plants means that heavy crop production rapidly depletes soils of potassium, and agricultural fertilizers consume 93% of the potassium chemical production of the modern world economy.

The functions of potassium and sodium in living organisms are quite different. Animals, in particular, employ sodium and potassium differentially to generate electrical potentials in animal cells, especially in nervous tissue. Potassium depletion in animals, including humans, results in various neurological dysfunctions. Characteristic concentrations of potassium in model organisms are: 30–300 mM in &quot;E. coli&quot;, 300 mM in budding yeast, 100 mM in mammalian cell and 4 mM in blood plasma.

== Function in plants ==
The main role of potassium in plants is to provide the ionic environment for metabolic processes in the cytosol, and as such functions as a regulator of various processes including growth regulation. Plants require potassium ions (K+) for protein synthesis and for the opening and closing of stomata, which is regulated by proton pumps to make surrounding guard cells either turgid or flaccid. A deficiency of potassium ions can impair a plant&#x27;s ability to maintain these processes. Potassium also functions in other physiological processes such as photosynthesis, protein synthesis, activation of some enzymes, phloem solute transport of photoassimilates into source organs, and maintenance of cation:anion balance in the cytosol and vacuole.

==Function in animals==
Potassium is the major cation (K+, a positive ion) inside animal cells, while sodium (Na+) is the major cation outside animal cells. The difference between the concentrations of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells, known as the membrane potential. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporters in the cell membrane. All potassium ion channels are tetramers with several conserved secondary structural elements. A number of potassium channel structures have been solved including voltage gated, ligand gated, tandem-pore, and inwardly rectifying channels, from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential—a &quot;spike&quot; of electrical discharge. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function.

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. National Academy of Medicine (NAM), on behalf of both the U.S. and Canada, sets Dietary Reference Intakes, including Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs), or Adequate Intakes (AIs) for when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs.

For both males and females under 9 years of age, the AIs for potassium are: 400mg of potassium for 0 to 6-month-old infants, 860mg of potassium for 7 to 12-month-old infants, 2,000mg of potassium for 1 to 3-year-old children, and 2,300mg of potassium for 4 to 8-year-old children.

For males 9 years of age and older, the AIs for potassium are: 2,500mg of potassium for 9 to 13-year-old males, 3,000mg of potassium for 14 to 18-year-old males, and 3,400mg for males that are 19 years of age and older.

For females 9 years of age and older, the AIs for potassium are: 2,300mg of potassium for 9 to 18-year-old females, and 2,600mg of potassium for females that are 19 years of age and older.

For pregnant and lactating females, the AIs for potassium are: 2,600mg of potassium for 14 to 18-year-old pregnant females, 2,900mg for pregnant females that are 19 years of age and older; furthermore, 2,500mg of potassium for 14 to 18-year-old lactating females, and 2,800mg for lactating females that are 19 years of age and older. As for safety, the NAM also sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals, but for potassium the evidence was insufficient, so no UL was established.

In 2019, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine revised the Adequate Intake for potassium to 2,600 mg/day for females 19 years of age and older who are not pregnant or lactating, and 3,400 mg/day for males 19 years of age and older.

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For people ages 15 and older, the AI is set at 3,500 mg/day. AIs for pregnancy is 3,500 mg/day, for lactation 4,000 mg/day. For children ages 1–14 years, the AIs increase with age from 800 to 2,700 mg/day. These AIs are lower than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient data to establish a UL for potassium.

===Labeling===
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For potassium labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 3500 mg, but as of May 2016, it has been revised to 4700 mg. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

==Supplements==
20 mEq (781 mg) potassium from potassium gluconate (4680 mg), or potassium citrate (2040 mg), mixed with a half-cup (1.12 dL) water, taken two to four times a day, may be used on a daily basis.

===Labeling===
Because of the risk of small-bowel lesions, the US FDA requires some potassium salts (for example potassium chloride) containing more than 99 mg (about 1.3 mEq) to be labeled with a warning.

==Food sources==
Eating a variety of foods that contain potassium is the best way to get an adequate amount. 
Foods with high sources of potassium include kiwifruit, orange juice, potatoes, coconut, avocados, apricots, parsnips and turnips, although many other fruits, vegetables, legumes, and meats contain potassium.

Common foods very high in potassium:
* beans (white beans and others)
* dark leafy greens (spinach, Swiss chard, and others)
* potatoes
* dried fruit (apricots, peaches, prunes, raisins; figs and dates)
* squash
* yogurt
* fish (salmon)
* avocado
* nuts (pistachios, almonds, walnuts, etc.) 
* seeds (squash, pumpkin, sunflower)

Foods containing the highest concentration:
* dried herbs
* sun dried tomatoes
* cocoa solids 
* whey powder
* paprika
* yeast extract
* rice bran
* molasses
* dry roasted soybeans

== Deficiency ==

=== High blood pressure/Hypertension ===
Diets low in potassium increase risk of hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular disease.

=== Hypokalemia ===
A severe shortage of potassium in body fluids may cause a potentially fatal condition known as hypokalemia. Hypokalemia typically results from loss of potassium through diarrhea, diuresis, or vomiting. Symptoms are related to alterations in membrane potential and cellular metabolism. Symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps, paralytic ileus, ECG abnormalities, intestinal paralysis, decreased reflex response and (in severe cases) respiratory paralysis, alkalosis and arrhythmia.

In rare cases, habitual consumption of large amounts of black licorice has resulted in hypokalemia. Licorice contains a compound (Glycyrrhizin) that increases urinary excretion of potassium.

=== Insufficient intake ===
Adult women in the United States consume on average half the AI, for men two-thirds. For all adults, fewer than 5% exceed the AI. Similarly, in the European Union, insufficient potassium intake is widespread.

== Side effects and toxicity ==

Gastrointestinal symptoms are the most common side effects of potassium supplements, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Taking potassium with meals or taking a microencapsulated form of potassium may reduce gastrointestinal side effects.

Hyperkalemia is the most serious adverse reaction to potassium. Hyperkalemia occurs when potassium builds up faster than the kidneys can remove it. It is most common in individuals with renal failure. Symptoms of hyperkalemia may include tingling of the hands and feet, muscular weakness, and temporary paralysis. The most serious complication of hyperkalemia is the development of an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia), which can lead to cardiac arrest.

Although hyperkalemia is rare in healthy individuals, oral doses greater than 18 grams taken at one time in individuals not accustomed to high intakes can lead to hyperkalemia.

<text>Speed reading is any of many techniques claiming to improve one&#x27;s ability to read quickly. Speed-reading methods include chunking and minimizing subvocalization. The many available speed-reading training programs may utilize books, videos, software, and seminars. There is little scientific evidence regarding speed reading, and as a result its value seems uncertain. Cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene says that claims of reading up to 1,000 words per minute &quot;must be viewed with skepticism&quot;.

== History ==
The term &quot;speed reading&quot; is thought to have been coined in the late 1950s by Evelyn Wood, a schoolteacher. She was reportedly curious why some people were naturally faster at reading, so tried to force herself to read very quickly. In 1958, while brushing off the pages of a book she had thrown, she noticed that the sweeping motion of her hand across the page caught the attention of her eyes, and helped them move more smoothly across the page. She then used the hand as a pacer. Wood first taught the method at the University of Utah, before launching it to the public as Evelyn Wood&#x27;s Reading Dynamics in Washington, D.C. in 1959.

== Methods and principles ==

===Skimming and scanning===
Skimming is a process of speed reading that involves visually searching the sentences of a page for clues to the main idea or when reading an essay, it can mean reading the beginning and ending for summary information, then optionally the first sentence of each paragraph to quickly determine whether to seek still more detail, as determined by the questions or purpose of the reading. For some people, this comes naturally, but is usually acquired by practice. Skimming is usually seen more in adults than in children. It is conducted at a higher rate (700 words per minute and above) than normal reading for comprehension (around 200–230 wpm), and results in lower comprehension rates, especially with information-rich reading material.

Scanning is the process where one actively looks for information using a mind-map (organizing information in a visually hierarchical manner that showcases the interrelatedness of the information for better retrievability) formed from skimming. These techniques are used by meta-guiding the eyes. Scanning includes the main point as well as headings and important information.

===Finger tracing===
With finger tracing or meta-guiding, readers point to specific lines or areas (with their fingers), to help focus on the sentences being read (or paragraphs being skimmed), reduce cognitive load, and increase retention.

== Types of reading ==
There are three types of reading:

# Subvocalization: sounding out each word internally, as reading to oneself. This is the slowest form of reading.
# Auditory reading: hearing out the read words. This is a faster process.
# Visual reading: understanding the meaning of the word, rather than sounding or hearing. This is the fastest process.

Subvocalization readers (Mental readers) generally read at approximately 250 words per minute, auditory readers at approximately 450 words per minute and visual readers at approximately 700 words per minute. Proficient readers are able to read 280–350 wpm without compromising comprehension.

== Effect on comprehension ==
Skimming is mainly used for researching and getting an overall idea of a text, especially when time is limited. Duggan &amp; Payne (2009) compared skimming with reading normally, given only enough time to read normally through half of a text. They found that the main points of the full text were better understood after skimming (which could view the full text) than after normal reading (which only read half the text). There was no difference between the groups in their understanding of less important information from the text. Skimming or skipping over text can also aid in comprehension when layered reading, a process of strategic rereading, is employed. Further findings suggest that trained speed readers have a slight advantage in both comprehension and speed to untrained skimmers. It is thus suggested by experts that speed-reading is most useful to those who need &quot;to skim a large amount of material or need to improve their study skills&quot; and less useful to those who read &quot;highly technical material that requires careful study of each sentence&quot;.

== Software ==
Computer programs are available to help instruct speed reading students. Some programs present the data as a serial stream, since the brain handles text more efficiently by breaking it into such a stream before parsing and interpreting it. The 2000 National Reading Panel (NRP) report (p. 3-1) seems to support such a mechanism.

To increase speed, some older programs required readers to view the center of the screen while the lines of text around it grew longer. They also presented several objects (instead of text) that move line by line or bounce around the screen. Users had to follow the object(s) with only their eyes. A number of researchers criticize using objects instead of words as an effective training method, claiming that the only way to read faster is to read actual text. Many of the newer speed reading programs use built-in text, and they primarily guide users through the lines of an on-screen book at defined speeds. Often, the text is highlighted to indicate where users should focus their eyes. They are not expected to read by pronouncing the words but instead to read by viewing the words as complete images. The exercises are also intended to train readers to eliminate subvocalization.

== Controversies in speed reading ==
Common controversies in speed reading are between its intent and nature with traditional concepts like comprehension versus speed, reading versus skimming, and popular psychology versus evidence-based psychology. Much of the controversy is raised over these points. This is mainly because a reading comprehension level of 50% is deemed unusable by some educationalists. Advocates claim that speed reading is a great success and that it is a demonstration of good comprehension for many purposes. The trade-off between speed and comprehension must be analyzed with respect to the type of reading that is being done, the risks associated with misunderstanding due to low comprehension, and the benefits associated with getting through the material quickly and gaining information at the actual rate is to be obtained. Mark Seidenberg considers claims like reading 25,000 words per minute &quot;cannot be true given basic facts about eyes and texts&quot;. He goes on to say that &quot;people are as likely to read thousands of words per minute as they are to run faster than the speed of light&quot;.

Similarly, in evaluating a claim that a similar reading strategy known as PhotoReading could increase reading rates to 25,000 words per minute, McNamara published a preliminary analysis funded by NASA to evaluate whether this strategy could improve reading speed, comprehension, and information gathering efficiency. When identical versions of five reading samples and accompanying reading comprehension tests were administered to a trainee and an expert in this reading strategy, there was no advantage in overall reading time or comprehension. This strategy may also cause overestimation of one&#x27;s knowledge, as demonstrated by the following case in McNamara&#x27;s preliminary analysis, showing evidence of the Dunning-Kruger effect:

In a 2016 article published in the journal of &quot;Psychological Science in the Public Interest&quot;, the authors conclude there is no &quot;magic bullet&quot; for reading more quickly while maintaining comprehension other than to practice reading and to become a more skilled language user (e.g. through increased vocabulary). The authors proceed with debunking common speed reading techniques such as eliminating sub-vocalization, reading more than one word at a time a.k.a. grouping, using RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation), increasing peripheral vision, alternating colors for each line of text. Marshall McLuhan was initially a convert to speed reading, however later concluded it was only useful for tasks like &quot;scanning junk mail&quot;.

U.S. President John F. Kennedy was a proponent of speed reading, encouraging his staff to take lessons, and he suggested in an interview that he had a reading speed of 1,200 words per minute. U.S. President Jimmy Carter, and his wife Rosalynn, were both avid readers and enrolled in a speed-reading course at the White House, along with several staff members.

Ronald Carver, a professor of education research and psychology, claims that the fastest college graduate readers can read only about 600 words per minute, at most twice as fast as their slowest counterparts, and suggests that Kennedy&#x27;s claimed reading speed was more a measure of how fast he could skim a piece of text. Other critics have suggested that speed reading is actually skimming, not reading.

The World Championship Speed Reading Competition stresses reading comprehension as critical. The top contestants typically read around 1,000 to 2,000 words per minute with approximately 50% comprehension or above. The six-time world champion Anne Jones is recorded for 4200 wpm with previous exposure to the material and 67% comprehension. The recorded number of words the eye can see in single fixation is three words.

&quot;Speed Reading World Record&quot; claims have been controversial. Howard Stephen Berg from the United States has claimed to be the Guinness World Record holder for fast reading with a speed of 25,000 words per minute, and Maria Teresa Calderon from the Philippines claims to have earned the Guinness World Record for World&#x27;s Fastest Reader at 80,000 words per minute reading speed and 100% comprehension. Critics point out that it is possible to beat some speed reading world records by reading a pre-read or pre-memorized text, flipping the pages as fast as possible without reading it. The Guinness Speed Reading World Record Standards are not known and they have terminated adding speed readers to its honor list. In 2015, &quot;Memoriad&quot;, the World Mental Sports Federation, set the rules for &quot;Speed Reading World Record Standards&quot; in order to prevent unclear claims.

<text>Simulation video games are a diverse super-category of video games, generally designed to closely simulate real world activities. A simulation game attempts to copy various activities from real life in the form of a game for various purposes such as training, analysis, prediction, or entertainment. Usually there are no strictly defined goals in the game, and the player is allowed to control a character or environment freely. Well-known examples are war games, business games, and role play simulation. From three basic types of strategic, planning, and learning exercises: games, simulations, and case studies, a number of hybrids may be considered, including simulation games that are used as case studies. Comparisons of the merits of simulation games versus other teaching techniques have been carried out by many researchers and a number of comprehensive reviews have been published.

==Subgenres==

===Construction and management simulation===
Construction and management simulation (CMS) is a type of simulation game in which players build, expand or manage fictional communities or projects with limited resources. Strategy games sometimes incorporate CMS aspects into their game economy, as players must manage resources while expanding their projects. Pure CMS games differ from strategy games in that &quot;the player&#x27;s goal is not to defeat an enemy, but to build something within the context of an ongoing process.&quot; Games in this category are sometimes also called &quot;management games&quot;.

===Life simulation===
Life simulation games (or artificial life games) are a subgenre of simulation video games in which the player lives or controls one or more artificial lifeforms. A life simulation game can revolve around &quot;individuals and relationships, or it could be a simulation of an ecosystem&quot;. Social simulation games are one of its subgenres.

===Sports===
Some video games simulate the playing of sports. Most sports have been recreated by video games, including team sports, athletics and extreme sports. Some games emphasize playing the sport (such as the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series), whilst others emphasize strategy and organization (such as &quot;Football Manager&quot;). Some, such as &quot;Arch Rivals&quot;, satirize the sport for comic effect. This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games, and is competitive, just like real-world sports. A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of real teams and players, and are updated continuously to reflect real-world changes.

===Other types===

* In medical simulation games, the player takes the role of a surgeon. Examples include the &quot;Trauma Center&quot; and &quot;&quot; series.
* In photography simulation games, players take photographs of animals or people. This includes games such as &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; and &quot;Afrika&quot;.
* In police simulation games, the player takes the role of law enforcement. Examples include the LCPDFR and LSPDFR and the &quot;Cops and Robbers V&quot; server for FiveM.
* Military simulation games are wargames with higher degrees of realism than other wargames set in a fantasy or science fiction environment. These attempt to simulate real warfare at either a tactical or strategic level.
** Some simulators, like &quot;GeoCommander&quot; by Intelligence Gaming, are designed for the US military to help new officers learn how to handle situations in a game setting before taking command in the field.
** Certain tactical shooters have higher degrees of realism than other shooters. Sometimes called &quot;soldier sims&quot;, these games try to simulate the feeling of being in combat. This includes games such as &quot;Arma&quot;.

* Vehicle simulation game
** Flight simulators, including amateur flight simulators, combat flight simulators and space flight simulators
** Racing video games, including sim racing
** Submarine simulator games
** Train simulator games
** Truck simulator games
* Immersive sims are typically played from the first-person perspective in a simulates a consistent lived-in world, and include elements of numerous gameplay systems that the player can use to complete objectives in many different manners, creating a sense of player agency and emergent gameplay.
* &quot;Blue collar&quot; games that include both realistic and hyper-realistic presentation of blue collar jobs in a game setting. These can include some of the vehicle simulation games including the flight, train and truck simulator titles, hunting games like &quot;TheHunter&quot; series, other job simulation games like &quot;House Flipper&quot; or &quot;PowerWash Simulator&quot;, and games themed around these types of jobs like &quot;Overcooked&quot;.
* Digital card games simulating blackjack and poker (including video poker)
* Video games designed to simulate mechanical or other real-world games. These may include simulations of pinball games and casino games such as slot machines, pachinko, and roulette.

== Simulation games in education ==

Because Simulation games make learning a matter of direct experience, they may relieve the tedium associated with more conventional modes of instruction, as they demand increased participation rather than merely reading about or discussing concepts and ideas (like discrimination, culture, stratification, and norms). Students will experience them by actually &quot;living&quot; the experiences. Therefore, the use of simulation games may increase students&#x27; motivation and interest in learning.

Simulation games can provide increased insights into how the world is seen, like the moral and intellectual idiosyncrasies of others. They may also increase empathy for others and help develop awareness of personal and interpersonal values by allowing players to see moral and ethical implications of the choices they make. As such, they can be used to change and improve students attitudes toward self, environment, and classroom learning.

Many games are designed to change and develop specific skills of decision making, problem solving and critical thinking (such as those involved in survey sampling, perception and communication).

==History==

&quot;The Sumerian Game&quot; (1964), a text-based early mainframe game designed by Mabel Addis, based on the ancient Sumerian city-state of Lagash, was the first economic simulation game. In 1968, Cornell University funded several simulation games which were developed by Prof. Robert Chase and his students. These included &quot;Cornell Hotel Administration Simulation Exercise&quot; and &quot;Cornell Restaurant Administration Simulation Exercise&quot;. Notably the restaurant game featured competitive play, with teams managing competing restaurants. The games drew attention from the relevant industries of the time and were made playable at national conventions for the American Hotel &amp; Motel Association and the Club Managers Association of America in 1969.

Another early economic sim by Danielle Bunten Berry, &quot;M.U.L.E.&quot;, released in 1983.

In the 1980s, it became a trend for arcade video games to use hydraulic motion simulator arcade cabinets. The trend was sparked by Sega&#x27;s &quot;taikan&quot; games, with &quot;taikan&quot; meaning &quot;body sensation&quot; in Japanese. Sega&#x27;s first game to use a motion simulator cabinet was &quot;Space Tactics&quot; (1981), a space combat simulator that had a cockpit cabinet where the screen moved in sync with the on-screen action. The &quot;taikan&quot; trend later began when Yu Suzuki&#x27;s team at Sega (later known as Sega AM2) developed &quot;Hang-On&quot; (1985), a racing video game where the player sits on and moves a motorbike replica to control the in-game actions. Suzuki&#x27;s team at Sega followed it with hydraulic motion simulator cockpit cabinets for rail shooters such as &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985), racing games such as &quot;Out Run&quot; (1986), and combat flight simulators such as &quot;After Burner&quot; (1987) and &quot;G-LOC: Air Battle&quot; (1990). One of the most sophisticated motion simulator cabinets in arcades was Sega&#x27;s R360 (1990), which simulated the full 360-degree rotation of an aircraft. Sega have since continued to manufacture motion simulator cabinets for arcade games through to the 2010s.

In the mid-1980s, Codemasters and the Oliver Twins released a number of games with &quot;Simulator&quot; in the title, including &quot;BMX Simulator&quot; (1986), &quot;Grand Prix Simulator&quot; (1986), and &quot;Pro Boxing Simulator&quot; (1988). Richard and David Darling of Codemasters were inspired by Concertmaster&#x27;s best-selling games, which were based on real sports such as football and BMX racing, which had a pre-existing popularity. In a parody of the established &quot;simulator&quot; cliche, &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; released a game titled &quot;Advanced Lawnmower Simulator&quot; in 1988.

The introduction of the city-building simulation subgenre is closely associated with the 1989 release of &quot;SimCity&quot; by developer Will Wright. However, earlier city-building titles had been published, including the 1984 Colecovision title &quot;Fortune Builder&quot;. Later games published by Wright&#x27;s company Maxis, including &quot;SimLife&quot; and &quot;SimEarth&quot;, simulated worlds at a broader scale, including recreations of genetics and global ecosystems.

A study of adolescents who played &quot;SimCity 2000&quot; found that those players had a greater appreciation and expectation of their government officials after playing.

<text>Auslan (; an abbreviation of Australian Sign Language) is the sign language used by the majority of the Australian Deaf community. Auslan is related to British Sign Language (BSL) and New Zealand Sign Language (NZSL); the three have descended from the same parent language, and together comprise the BANZSL language family. As with other sign languages, Auslan&#x27;s grammar and vocabulary is quite different from spoken English. Its origin cannot be attributed to any individual; rather, it is a natural language that emerged spontaneously and has changed over time.

==Recognition and status==
Auslan was recognised by the Australian government as a &quot;community language other than English&quot; and the preferred language of the Deaf community in policy statements in 1987 and 1991. However, this recognition has yet to filter through to many institutions, government departments, and professionals who work with deaf people.

The emerging status of Auslan has gone hand-in-hand with the advancement of the Deaf community in Australia, beginning in the early 1980s. In 1982, the registration of the first sign language interpreters by NAATI, a newly established regulatory body for interpreting and translating, accorded a sense of legitimacy to Auslan, furthered by the publishing of the first dictionary of Auslan in 1989 (Johnston, 1989). Auslan began to emerge as a language of instruction for Deaf students in primary and secondary schools from the late 1980s—mainly through the provision of Auslan/English interpreters in mainstream (hearing) schools with deaf support units, but also in some specialised bilingual programmes for deaf children. Boosted by the 1992 enactment of the federal Disability Discrimination Act, Auslan/English interpreters are also increasingly provided in tertiary education.

Today there is a growing number of courses teaching Auslan as a second language, from an elective language subject offered by some secondary schools to a two-year full-time diploma at TAFE.

Auslan content on television in Australia is limited. For some time, &quot;Deaf TV&quot;, which was entirely in Auslan and was produced by Deaf volunteers, aired on community television station Channel 31 in Melbourne. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Auslan experienced a period of increased visibility through press conferences from federal and state leaders and health officials, which invariably featured Auslan interpreters. Since 2020, the ABC News channel&#x27;s Sunday 5pm bulletin has included Auslan interpretation.

===Prominent advocates for Auslan===
In 2006 David Gibson was the first member of any Parliament in Australia to give a maiden speech in Auslan and was involved in Auslan events for the National Week of Deaf People at the Queensland Parliament, including the use of Auslan interpreters for question time and a debate between members of the deaf community and members of parliament on disability issues in 2007.

The Young Australian of the Year for 2015, Drisana Levitzke-Gray, is a strong proponent of Auslan and, in her acceptance speech using Auslan, called on the Government of Australia, and Australians, to learn and use Auslan as a natural language, as a human right for Australians.

==History==
Auslan evolved from sign language varieties brought to Australia during the nineteenth century from Britain and Ireland. The earliest record of a deaf Australian was convict Elizabeth Steel, who arrived in 1790 on the Second Fleet ship &quot;Lady Juliana&quot;. There is as yet no historical evidence, however, that she used a sign language. One of the first known signing Deaf immigrants was the engraver John Carmichael who arrived in Sydney in 1825 from Edinburgh. He had been to a Deaf school there, and was known as a good storyteller in sign language.

Thirty-five years later, in 1860, a school for the Deaf was established by another Deaf Scotsman, Thomas Pattison—the Royal Institute for Deaf and Blind Children in New South Wales. In Victoria just a few weeks later, the Victorian College for the Deaf was founded by a Deaf Englishman, Frederick J Rose, who had been educated at the Old Kent Road School in London. These schools and others had an enormous role in the development of Auslan, as they were the first contact with sign language for many Deaf children. Because they were residential boarding schools, they provided ample opportunity for the language to thrive, even though in many schools, signing was banned from the classroom for much of the 20th century.

Irish Sign Language (ISL) also had an influence on the development of Auslan, as it was used in Catholic schools until the 1950s. The first Catholic school for Deaf children was established in 1875 by Irish nuns. As such, like Auslan evolving from BSL, Australian Irish Sign Language (or AISL) was born. Unlike British Sign Language, both ISL and AISL use a one-handed alphabet originating in French Sign Language (LSF), and although this alphabet has now almost disappeared from Australia, some initialised signs from the ISL/AISL manual alphabet are still used in Auslan.

In more recent times, Auslan has seen a significant amount of lexical borrowing from American Sign Language (ASL), especially in signs for technical terms. Some of these arose from the Signed English educational philosophies of the 1970s and 80s, when a committee looking for signs with direct equivalence to English words found them in ASL and/or in invented English-based signed systems used in North America and introduced them in the classroom. ASL contains many signs initialised from an alphabet which was also derived from LSF, and Auslan users, already familiar with the related ISL alphabet, accepted many of the new signs easily.

== Grammar ==

=== Word order ===
Previously, Auslan had been said to be an OSV, but more recent scholars have said that this idea is a false-equivalent of Auslan with spoken languages and that using anchor signs is not the same as word order. In general, word order in Auslan takes into account context and fluidity between signs being used, being less rigid than many spoken languages. Rather, Auslan instead follows the clause/word order off TTC—Time, topic, comment. The frequency of SVO in Auslan may come from code-switching with English (with very high bilingualism for Auslan users), as it is more common with &quot;loan words (signs), English-based idiomatic phrases [and] fingerspelling&quot; as well as by those who learned Auslan later in life.

In question phrases, the question word must always be at the end in Auslan in open questions. This word order is the same for both questions and statements, with questions in Auslan formed by either adding a question word at the end of a clause TOM KICKED PETER WHY or using nonmanual features of a questioning expression.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs in Auslan which are &quot;depicting signs&quot; use head-marking to show the semantic role of the arguments, rather than subject/object. An example of this is the word &quot;give&quot;, which involves an actor and a recipient. Both of these arguments can be expressed on the verb by using signing space.

Verb-predicates can be formed by using individual vocabulary words in sequential order (more commonly used by anglophones who speak Auslan as a second language) or using depicting signs, which can &quot;blur&quot; word order, as it allows for multiple signs to be used at once. This is generally a mark of high competence and fluency in the language. Lexicalisation of common predicates is common, and compounding is the most common way that new lexical items are produced.

Auslan is a zero-copula language, which means that the verb &quot;to be&quot; is not used at all except when quoting English (in which it is finger-spelt). Auslan replaces copula with interrogatives for certain phrase types, sometimes in this context called &quot;rhetorical questions&quot; or &quot;modifiers&quot;, using non-manual features to express that it is a statement rather than a question. The interrogatives of Auslan are more or less direct translations to English ones, with WHY used for this purpose sometimes translated as BECAUSE. Examples of use are as follows:

* Phoebe is an engineer : PHOEBE WHAT ENGINEER
* She is at school : SHE WHERE SCHOOL
* I went shopping with my sister : (BEFORE) I SHOP WITH WHO MY SISTER

=== Pronouns ===
Pronouns are established using the signing space, either arbitrary (for non-present people/things) or iconic. For example, &quot;I will give you the doll tomorrow&quot; would be signed as TOMORROW DOLL GIVE, with the sign GIVE starting at the speaker&#x27;s body and finishing at the receiver&#x27;s. The use of signing space also makes all pronouns non-gendered.

==Auslan in relation to English==
It is sometimes wrongly assumed that English-speaking countries share a single sign language. Auslan is a natural language distinct from spoken or written English. Its grammar and vocabulary often do not have direct English equivalents and vice versa. However, English, as the dominant language in Australia, has had a significant influence on Auslan, especially through manual forms such as fingerspelling and (more recently) Signed English.

It is difficult to sign Auslan fluently while speaking English, as the word order may be different, and there is often no direct sign-to-word equivalence. However, mouthing of an English word together with a sign may serve to clarify when one sign may have several English equivalents. In some cases, the mouth gesture that accompanies a sign may not reflect the equivalent translation in English (e.g. a sign meaning &quot;thick&quot; may be accompanied by a mouth gesture that does not resemble any English word).

===Fingerspelling===

A two-handed manual alphabet, identical to the one used in British Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language, is integral to Auslan. This alphabet is used for fingerspelling proper nouns such as personal or place names, common nouns for everyday objects, and English words, especially technical terms, for which there is no widely used sign. Fingerspelling can also be used for emphasis, clarification, or, sometimes extensively, by English-speaking learners of Auslan. The proportion of fingerspelling versus signs varies with the context and the age of the signer. A recent small-scale study puts fingerspelled words in Auslan conversations at about 10% of all lexical items, roughly equal to ASL and higher than many other sign languages, such as New Zealand Sign Language. The proportion is higher in older signers, suggesting that the use of fingerspelling has diminished over time.

Schembri and Johnston (2007) found that the most commonly fingerspelled words in Auslan include &quot;so&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;if&quot;, &quot;but&quot; and &quot;do&quot;.

Some signs also feature an English word&#x27;s initial letter as a handshape from a one- or two-handed manual alphabet and use it within a sign. For example, part of the sign for &quot;Canberra&quot; incorporates the letter &quot;C&quot;.

===Signed English===
Australasian Signed English was created in the late 1970s to represent English words and grammar, using mostly Auslan signs together with some additional contrived signs, as well as borrowings from American Sign Language (ASL). It was used largely in education for teaching English to Deaf children or for &quot;discussing&quot; English in academic contexts, and it is not clear to what extent this continues to be the case. It was thought to be much easier for hearing teachers and parents to learn another mode of English than to learn a new language with a complex spatial grammar such as Auslan.

The use of Signed English in schools is controversial with some in the Deaf community, who regard Signed English as a contrived and unnatural artificially constructed language. Signed English has now been largely rejected by Deaf communities in Australia and its use in education is dwindling; however, a number of its signs have made their way into normal use.

==Acquisition and nativeness==
Unlike oral languages, only a minority of Deaf children acquire their language from their parents (about 4 or 5% have Deaf parents). Most acquire Auslan from Deaf peers at school or later through Deaf community networks. Many learn Auslan as a &quot;delayed&quot; first language in adolescence or adulthood, after attempting to learn English (or another spoken/written language) without the exposure necessary to properly acquire it. The Deaf community often distinguish between &quot;oral deaf&quot; who grew up in an oral or signed English educational environment without Auslan, and those &quot;&quot;Deaf&quot; Deaf&quot; who learnt Auslan at an early age from Deaf parents or at a Deaf school. Regardless of their background, many Deaf adults consider Auslan to be their first or primary language, and see themselves as users of English as a second language.

==Variation and standardisation==
Auslan exhibits a high degree of variation, determined by the signer&#x27;s age, educational background, and regional origin, and the signing community is very accepting of a wide range of individual differences in signing style.

There is no standard dialect of Auslan. Standard dialects arise through the support of institutions, such as the media, education, government and the law. As this support has not existed for most sign languages, coupled with the lack of a widely used written form and communications technologies, Auslan has probably diverged much more rapidly from BSL than Australian English has from British English.

Auslan was introduced to Papua New Guinea, where it mixed with local or home sign and Tok Pisin to produce Papua New Guinean Sign Language. Sign languages related to Auslan also appear to be used in some other parts of the Asia-Pacific, such as in Fiji.

===Dialects===
Linguists often regard Auslan as having two major dialects—Northern (Queensland and New South Wales), and Southern (Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia). The vocabulary of the two dialects traditionally differed significantly, with different signs used even for very common concepts such as colours, animals, and days of the week; differences in grammar appear to be slight.

These two dialects may have roots in older dialectal differences from the United Kingdom, brought over by Deaf immigrants who founded the first schools for the Deaf in Australia — varieties from the southeast of England in Melbourne and Scottish varieties in Sydney, although the relationship between lexical variation in the UK and Australia appears much more complicated than this (some Auslan signs appear similar to signs used in a range of regional varieties of BSL). Before schools were established elsewhere, Deaf children attended one of these two initial schools, and brought signs back to their own states. As schools opened up in each state, new signs also developed in the dormitories and playgrounds of these institutions. As a result, Auslan users can identify more precise regional varieties (e.g., &quot;Sydney sign&quot;, &quot;Melbourne sign&quot;, &quot;Perth sign&quot;, &quot;Adelaide sign&quot; and &quot;Brisbane sign&quot;), and even vocabulary that may have been unique to individual schools. In a conversation between two strangers, one from Melbourne and the other from Perth, it is likely that one will use a small number of signs unfamiliar to the other, despite both belonging to the same &quot;southern dialect&quot;. Signers can often identify which school someone went to, even within a few short utterances.

Despite these differences, communication between Auslan users from different regions poses little difficulty for most Deaf Australians, who often become aware of different regional vocabulary as they grow older, through travel and Deaf community networks, and because Deaf people are so well practised in bridging barriers to communication.

==Indigenous Australian sign languages and Auslan==

A number of Indigenous Australian sign languages exist, unrelated to Auslan, such as Warlpiri Sign Language and Yolngu Sign Language. They occur in the southern, central, and western desert regions, coastal Arnhem Land, some islands of the north coast, the western side of Cape York Peninsula, and on some Torres Strait Islands. They have also been noted as far south as the Murray River.

Deaf Indigenous people of Far North Queensland (extending from Yarrabah to Cape York) form a distinct signing community using a dialect of Auslan; it has features of Indigenous sign languages and gestural systems as well as signs and grammar of Auslan.

==Written and recorded Auslan==
Auslan has no written form; in the past transcribing Auslan was largely an academic exercise. The first Auslan dictionaries used either photographs or drawings with motion arrows to describe signs; more recently, technology has made possible the use of short video clips on CD-ROM or online dictionaries.

SignWriting, however, has its adherents in Australia.

&quot;A Silent Agreement&quot; was Australia&#x27;s first theatrically released feature film to showcase Australian Sign Language in its main dialogue and as a plot element, with some scenes depicted entirely in Auslan. There is also one scene where the characters discuss the risky politics of using non-deaf actors using sign language in film.

<doc id="378919" wikidata="Q796606" url="?curid=378919" title="Shake, Rattle and Roll">
<text>&quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; is a song written in 1954 by Jesse Stone (usually credited as &quot;Charles Calhoun&quot;, his songwriting name) and first recorded that year by Big Joe Turner, whose version ranked No. 127 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Background==
In early 1954, Ahmet Ertegun of Atlantic Records suggested to Jesse Stone that he write an up-tempo blues for Big Joe Turner, a blues shouter whose career had begun in Kansas City before World War II. Stone played around with various phrases before coming up with &quot;shake, rattle and roll&quot;. (Stone used his real name for ASCAP songs, while using the pseudonym &quot;Charles Calhoun&quot; for BMI-registered songs, such as &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;).

However, the phrase had been used in earlier songs. In 1910, vaudeville performer Baby Franklin Seals published &quot;You Got to Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;, a ragtime tune about gambling with dice, in New Orleans; in 1919, Al Bernard recorded a version of the song.

==Joe Turner original==
Turner recorded &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; in New York City on February 15, 1954. Atlantic released it as a single in April 1954, that reached number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart and number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart.

==Bill Haley version==
Bill Haley &amp; His Comets recorded a cover version of the song on June 7, 1954, the same week Turner&#x27;s version first topped the R&amp;B chart. The Comets provided the instrumental accompaniment: Johnny Grande on piano, Billy Williamson on rhythm guitar, Marshall Lytle on bass, and Joey Ambrose on saxophone. Haley&#x27;s version was released in August and reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart, spending a total of twenty-seven weeks in the Top 40. In the UK, it peaked at number four.

==Elvis Presley versions==
Elvis Presley recorded the song twice in a studio setting: a demo recorded at radio station KDAV in Lubbock, Texas in January 1955 while under contract with Sun Records (this recording was not released until the 1990s) and as a 1956 single for RCA Victor.

Introduced by Cleveland disc jockey Bill Randle, rhythm guitar Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore, bassist Bill Black, and drummer D. J. Fontana performed the song in medley with the similar &quot;Flip, Flop and Fly&quot; on the January 28, 1956, broadcast of the Dorsey Brothers &quot;Stage Show&quot; (Haley&#x27;s &quot;kitchen&quot; opening verse was sung).

<doc id="378922" wikidata="Q16951214" url="?curid=378922" title="Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act">
<text>The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, also called the Medicare Modernization Act or MMA, is a federal law of the United States, enacted in 2003. It produced the largest overhaul of Medicare in the public health program&#x27;s 38-year history.

The MMA was signed by President George W. Bush on December 8, 2003, after passing in Congress by a close margin.

== Prescription drug benefits ==

The MMA&#x27;s most touted feature is the introduction of an entitlement benefit for prescription drugs, through tax breaks and subsidies.

In the years since Medicare&#x27;s creation in 1965, the role of prescription drugs in patient care has significantly increased. As new and expensive drugs have come into use, patients, particularly senior citizens at whom Medicare was targeted, have found prescriptions harder to afford. The MMA was designed to address this problem.

The benefit is funded in a complex way, reflecting diverse priorities of lobbyists and constituencies.
* It provides a subsidy for large employers to discourage them from eliminating private prescription coverage to retired workers (a key AARP goal);
* It prohibits the federal government from negotiating discounts with drug companies;
* It prevents the government from establishing a formulary, but does not prevent private providers such as HMOs from doing so.

=== Basic prescription drug coverage ===
Beginning in 2006, a prescription drug benefit called Medicare Part D was made available. Coverage is available only through insurance companies and HMOs, and is voluntary.

Enrollees paid the following initial costs for the initial benefits: a minimum monthly premium of $24.80 (premiums may vary), a $180 to $265 annual deductible, 25% (or approximate flat copay) of full drug costs up to $2,400. After the initial coverage limit is met, a period commonly referred to as the &quot;Donut Hole&quot; begins when an enrollee may be responsible for the insurance company&#x27;s negotiated price of the drug, less than the retail price without insurance. The Affordable Care Act, also commonly known as &quot;Obamacare&quot;, modified this measure.

==Medicare Advantage plans==
With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Medicare beneficiaries were given the option to receive their Medicare benefits through private health insurance plans, instead of through the Original Medicare plan (Parts A and B). These programs were known as &quot;Medicare+Choice&quot; or &quot;Part C&quot; plans. Pursuant to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the compensation and business practices for insurers that offer these plans changed, and &quot;Medicare+Choice&quot; plans became known as &quot;Medicare Advantage&quot; (MA) plans. In addition to offering comparable coverage to Part A and Part B, Medicare Advantage plans may also offer Part D coverage.

===Changes to plans===
With the MMA, new Medicare Advantage plans were established with several substantive differences from the previous Medicare + Choice plans, including:
* enrollees sign on for a whole year
* care could be restricted to specific provider networks
* formularies were to be used to restrict prescription drug choices
* prescription coverage would be deferred to the patient or a Medicare Part D prescription plan
* care other than emergency care can be restricted to a particular region
* federal reimbursement can be adjusted according to the health risk of the enrollees

==Health savings accounts==
The MMA created a new Health Savings Account statute that replaced and expanded the previous Medical Savings Account law by expanding allowable contributions and employer participation. After the first 10 years over 12 million Americans were enrolled in HSAs (AHIP;EBRI).

==Other provisions==
While nearly all agreed that some form of prescription drug benefit would be included, other provisions were the subject of prolonged debate in Congress. The complex legislation also changed Medicare in the following ways:
* it mandated a six-city trial of a partly privatized Medicare system (by 2010)
* it gave an extra $25 billion to rural hospitals (at the request of congressional representatives in the rural West)
* it required higher fees from wealthier seniors
* it added a pretax health savings account for working people
* it required Medicare Part D plans to support electronic prescribing, with a planned implementation date of April 2009.

===Medicare administration of claims===
In addition, the legislation mandated a major overhaul of how Part A and Part B claims are processed.

Under the new legislation, the Fiscal Intermediaries (FIs) and carriers would be replaced by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC&#x27;s), serving both Parts A and B, and would be consolidated into fifteen Jurisdictions:
* Jurisdiction 1—California, Hawaii, and Nevada, plus American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands
* Jurisdiction 2—Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington
* Jurisdiction 3—Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming
* Jurisdiction 4—Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas
* Jurisdiction 5—Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska
* Jurisdiction 6—Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin
* Jurisdiction 7—Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi
* Jurisdiction 8—Indiana and Michigan
* Jurisdiction 9—Florida, plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
* Jurisdiction 10—Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee
* Jurisdiction 11—North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia
* Jurisdiction 12—Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
* Jurisdiction 13—Connecticut and New York
* Jurisdiction 14—Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont
* Jurisdiction 15—Kentucky and Ohio

Four &quot;Specialty MAC Jurisdictions&quot; were also created to handle durable medical equipment and home health/hospice claims:
* Jurisdiction A—consists of all states in Jurisdictions 12, 13, and 14
* Jurisdiction B—consists of all states in Jurisdictions 6, 8, and 15
* Jurisdiction C—consists of all states and territories in Jurisdictions 4, 7, 9, 10, and 11
* Jurisdiction D—consists of all states and territories in Jurisdictions 1, 2, 3, and 5

Finally, the underlying contracts would be subject to competition, and would also be subject to the requirements of the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

==Legislative history==
According to the New York Times December 17, 2004 editorial W.J.&quot;Billy&quot; Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee from 2001 until February 4, 2004, was one of the chief architects of the new Medicare law. In 2004 Tauzin was appointed as chief lobbyist for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the trade association and lobby group for the drug industry with a &quot;rumored salary of $2 million a year,&quot; drawing criticism from Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group. They claimed that Tauzin &quot;may have been negotiating for the lobbying job while writing the Medicare legislation.&quot; Tauzin was responsible for including a provision that prohibited Medicare from negotiating prices with drug companies.

House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said,

The bill was debated and negotiated for nearly six months in Congress, and finally passed amid unusual circumstances. Several times in the legislative process the bill had appeared to have failed, but each time was saved when a couple of Congressmen and Senators switched positions on the bill.

The bill was introduced in the House of Representatives early on June 25, 2003, as H.R. 1, sponsored by Speaker Dennis Hastert. All that day and the next the bill was debated, and it was apparent that the bill would be very divisive. In the early morning of June 27, a floor vote was taken. After the initial electronic vote, the count stood at 214 yeas, 218 nays.

Three Republican representatives then changed their votes. One opponent of the bill, Ernest J. Istook Jr. (R-OK-5), changed his vote to &quot;present&quot; upon being told that C.W. Bill Young (R-FL-10), who was absent due to a death in the family, would have voted &quot;aye&quot; if he had been present. Next, Republicans Butch Otter (ID-1) and Jo Ann Emerson (MO-8) switched their vote to &quot;aye&quot; under pressure from the party leadership. The bill passed by one vote, 216–215.

On June 26, the Senate passed its version of the bill, 76–21. The bills were unified in conference, and on November 21, the bill came back to the House for approval.

The bill came to a vote at 3 a.m. on November 22. After 45 minutes, the bill was losing, 219–215, with David Wu (D-OR-1) not voting. Speaker Dennis Hastert and Majority Leader Tom DeLay sought to convince some of dissenting Republicans to switch their votes, as they had in June. Istook, who had always been a wavering vote, consented quickly, producing a 218-216 tally. In a highly unusual move, the House leadership held the vote open for hours as they sought two more votes. Then-Representative Nick Smith (R-MI) claimed he was offered campaign funds for his son, who was running to replace him, in return for a change in his vote from &quot;nay&quot; to &quot;yea.&quot; After controversy ensued, Smith clarified no explicit offer of campaign funds was made, but that he was offered &quot;substantial and aggressive campaign support&quot; which he had assumed included financial support.

At about 5:50 a.m., Otter and Trent Franks (AZ-2) were convinced to switch their votes. With passage assured, Wu voted yea as well, and Democrats Calvin M. Dooley (CA-20), Jim Marshall (GA-3) and David Scott (GA-13) changed their votes to the affirmative. But Brad Miller (D-NC-13), and then, Republican John Culberson (TX-7), reversed their votes from &quot;yea&quot; to &quot;nay&quot;. The bill passed 220–215.

The Democrats cried foul, and Bill Thomas, the Republican chairman of the Ways and Means committee, challenged the result in a gesture to satisfy the concerns of the minority. He subsequently voted to table his own challenge; the tally to table was 210 ayes, 193 noes.

The Senate&#x27;s consideration of the conference report was somewhat less heated, as cloture on it was invoked by a vote of 70–29. However, a budget point of order was raised by Tom Daschle, and voted on. As 60 votes were necessary to override it, the challenge was actually considered to have a credible chance of passing.

For several minutes, the vote total was stuck at 58–39, until Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Trent Lott (R-MS), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) voted in quick succession in favor to pass the vote 61–39. The bill itself was finally passed 54–44 on November 25, 2003, and was signed into law by the President on December 8.

==Costs==
Initially, the net cost of the program was projected at $400 billion for the ten-year period between 2004 and 2013. Administration official Thomas Scully instructed analyst Richard Foster not to tell Congress of Foster&#x27;s finding that the cost would actually be over $500 billion. One month after passage, the administration estimated that the net cost of the program over the period between 2006 (the first year the program started paying benefits) and 2015 would be $534 billion. As of February 2009, the projected net cost of the program over the 2006 to 2015 period was $549.2 billion.

==Bar to negotiation of prescription drug prices==
After the enactment of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act in 2003, only insurance companies administering Medicare prescription drug program, not Medicare, would have the legal right to negotiate drug prices directly with drug manufacturers. The Medicare Prescription Drug Act expressly prohibited Medicare from negotiating bulk prescription drug prices. Oregon Representative Peter DeFazio said, &quot;We could provide a much more meaningful benefit if we negotiated lower prices as other nations have done,&quot; and his Maine colleague Tom Allen (Maine politician), remarked on the absurdity, &quot;that the government will not be able to negotiate lower prices,&quot; for the drugs on which it plans to spend $400 billion in the next decade.

The &quot;donut hole&quot; provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 was an attempt to correct the issue. In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act removed this ban and allowed Medicare to begin negotiating drug prices starting in 2026.

<doc id="378926" wikidata="Q380133" url="?curid=378926" title="Kiri Te Kanawa">
<text>Dame Kiri Jeanette Claire Te Kanawa (; born Claire Mary Teresa Rawstron, 6 March 1944) is a New Zealand opera singer. She had a full lyric soprano voice, which has been described as &quot;mellow yet vibrant, warm, ample and unforced&quot;. On 1 December 1971 she was recognised internationally when she appeared as the Countess in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; at the Royal Opera House in London.

Te Kanawa received accolades in many countries, performing works composed in the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries and singing in several languages. She was particularly associated with the music of Mozart, Verdi, and Puccini and Richard Strauss, and was often cast as an aristocrat. Her extensive discography includes three albums which featured in the top forty in charts in Australia in the mid-1980s.

Towards the end of her career, Te Kanawa appeared in opera only rarely, preferring to perform in concerts and recitals. She also devoted much of her time to giving masterclasses and supporting young opera singers through the period of their apprenticeship.

==Personal life==

Te Kanawa was born Claire Mary Teresa Rawstron in Gisborne, New Zealand, to Māori butcher Tieki &quot;Jack&quot; Wawatai and to Mary Noeleen Rawstron, who was the daughter of Irish immigrants. Wawatai was already married to Apo, the daughter of the Rev. Poihipi Kōhere. Rawstron&#x27;s mother insisted the baby be given up for adoption. Te Kanawa was adopted as an infant by Thomas Te Kanawa, the owner of a successful trucking business, and his wife Nell. Kiri Te Kanawa&#x27;s adoptive family is Ngāti Maniapoto.

She was educated at St Mary&#x27;s College, Auckland, and formally trained in operatic singing by Sister Mary Leo Niccol. Te Kanawa began her singing career as a mezzo-soprano but developed into a soprano. Her recording of the &quot;Nuns&#x27; Chorus&quot; from the Benatzky&#x27;s operetta &quot;Casanova&quot; was the first gold record produced in New Zealand.

Te Kanawa met Desmond Park on a blind date in London in August 1967, and they married six weeks later at St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Auckland. They adopted two children, Antonia (born 1976) and Thomas (born 1979). The couple divorced in 1997. Te Kanawa never made an attempt to contact her biological parents, but her half-brother Jim Rawstron contacted her. Initially, she was unwilling to meet him, but agreed to do so in 1997. The episode ended bitterly, when a newspaper ran a story on their meeting; despite Rawstron denying contact with the newspaper, Te Kanawa has since reaffirmed her decision to have nothing to do with her birth family.

==Career==
In her teens and early 20s, Te Kanawa was a pop star and entertainer at clubs in New Zealand, and regularly appeared in newspapers and magazines. In 1963, she was runner-up to Malvina Major in the Mobil Song Quest with her performance of &quot;Vissi d&#x27;arte&quot; from Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot;, and in 1965 she won the same competition. As winner, she received a grant to study in London.

She appeared and sang in the 1966 musical comedy film &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Get You&quot;. In 1966, she won the Melbourne Sun-Aria contest, which Major had won the previous year. Both singers had been taught by Sister Mary Leo.

===Early years in London===
In 1966, without an audition, she enrolled at the London Opera Centre to study under Vera Rózsa and James Robertson, who reputedly said Te Kanawa lacked a singing technique when she arrived at the school but had a gift for captivating audiences. She first appeared on stage as the Second Lady in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;. On a recommendation by Richard Bonynge, she changed to soprano training in 1967. When she performed the title role of Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Dido and Aeneas&quot; in a concert performance that year, music critic Alan Blyth predicted that she was to be the &quot;opera star of the next decade&quot;. in December 1968 she repeated the role at the Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre.

She also performed the title role in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Anna Bolena&quot;. In 1969, she appeared as Elena in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La donna del lago&quot; at the Camden Festival. Praise for her Idamante in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo&quot; led to an offer of a three-year contract as junior principal at the Royal Opera House, where she made her debut as Xenia in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; and a Flower Maiden in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 1970. She was offered the role of the Countess in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; after an audition of which the conductor, Colin Davis, said, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe my ears. I&#x27;ve taken thousands of auditions, but it was such a fantastically beautiful voice.&quot; Under director John Copley, Te Kanawa was carefully groomed for the role for a December 1971 opening.

===International career===
Meanwhile, word of her success had reached John Crosby at the Santa Fe Opera, a summer opera festival in New Mexico then about to begin its 15th season. He cast her as the Countess in &quot;Figaro&quot;, which opened on 30 July 1971. The production also featured Frederica von Stade&#x27;s first appearance in what was to become her signature role, Cherubino. According to a historian of the Santa Fe company, &quot;It was two of the newcomers who left the audience dazzled: Frederica von Stade as Cherubino and Te Kanawa as the Countess. Everyone knew at once that these were brilliant finds. History has confirmed that first impression.&quot;

On 1 December 1971 at Covent Garden, Te Kanawa repeated her Santa Fe performance and created an international sensation as the Countess: &quot;with &#x27;Porgi amor&#x27; Kiri knocked the place flat.&quot; This was followed by performances as the Countess at the Opéra National de Lyon and San Francisco Opera in 1972. She first sang Desdemona in &quot;Otello&quot; in Glasgow in 1972, while her 1974 Metropolitan Opera (Met) début as Desdemona took place at short notice: she replaced an ill Teresa Stratas at the last minute, and performed alongside Jon Vickers in the title role. Te Kanawa sang at the Glyndebourne Festival in 1973, with further débuts in Paris and (1975), Sydney (1976), Milan (1978), Salzburg (1979), and Vienna (1980). In 1982, she gave her only stage performances as &quot;Tosca&quot; in Paris. In 1989, she added Elisabeth de Valois in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot; to her repertory at Chicago, and, in 1990, the Countess in &quot;Capriccio&quot; by Richard Strauss, sung first at San Francisco and with equal success at Covent Garden, Glyndebourne and the Met in 1998.

In subsequent years, Te Kanawa performed at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, Paris Opera, Sydney Opera House, the Vienna State Opera, La Scala, Bavarian State Opera in Munich and Cologne Opera, adding to her repertoire the Mozart roles of Donna Elvira in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, Pamina in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, and Fiordiligi in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, and Italian roles such as Mimi in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;. She played Donna Elvira in Joseph Losey&#x27;s 1979 film adaptation of &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. She was seen and heard around the world in 1981 by an estimated 600 million people when she sang Handel&#x27;s &quot;Let the bright Seraphim&quot; at the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer.

In 1984, Leonard Bernstein decided to re-record the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, conducting his own music for the first time. Generally known as the &quot;operatic version&quot;, it starred Te Kanawa as Maria, José Carreras as Tony, Tatiana Troyanos as Anita, Kurt Ollmann as Riff, and Marilyn Horne as the offstage voice who sings &quot;Somewhere&quot;. Te Kanawa was the first of the singers to join the project, saying, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t believe it...This was music I&#x27;d grown up with, music I&#x27;d always wanted to sing.&quot; The album won a Grammy Award for Best Cast Show Album in 1985, and the recording process was filmed as a documentary, &quot;The Making of West Side Story&quot;.

Te Kanawa has a particular affinity for the heroines of Richard Strauss. Her first appearance in the title role in &quot;Arabella&quot; was at the Houston Grand Opera in 1977, followed by the roles of the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and the Countess in &quot;Capriccio&quot;. Many performances were given under the baton of Georg Solti and it was with him that in 1981 she made a recording of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;.

She participated in Prince Edward&#x27;s 1987 charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;.

In 1991, she premiered the theme song &quot;World in Union&quot; at the 1991 Rugby World Cup, which reached No.4 on the UK Singles Chart.
In 1992, she performed at the Last Night of the Proms, where she sang &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot;.

In 1995, Te Kanawa performed the role of Maria Boccanegra in the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;, alongside Plácido Domingo, conducted by James Levine.

Later in her career, her appearances on stage became infrequent, but she remained busy as a concert singer. She appeared in performances in the title role of Barber&#x27;s &quot;Vanessa&quot; in Monte Carlo (televised in 2001), with the Washington National Opera (2002), and the Los Angeles Opera in November to December 2004. Te Kanawa appeared as a &quot;Pennington Great Performers&quot; series artist with the Baton Rouge Symphony Orchestra in 2004.

In 2006, Te Kanawa sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to Queen Elizabeth followed by &quot;God Save The Queen&quot; at the Commonwealth Games in Australia.

In April 2010, Te Kanawa sang the Marschallin in &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; in two performances at the Cologne Opera. That same year, she played the spoken role of The Duchess of Krakenthorp in Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;La fille du régiment&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, and sang a tango. She repeated this role at the Met in a revival during the 2011–12 season, repeating it again in Vienna in 2013 and at Covent Garden in March 2014, a run that encompassed her 70th birthday. In the meantime, she performed at Haruhisa Handa&#x27;s inaugural Tokyo Global Concert at Nakano-Zero Hall in Nakano, Tokyo, Japan, on 10 September 2013. In October 2013 she appeared in the role of Nellie Melba in the television series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;.

== Retirement years ==
On 13 September 2017, Te Kanawa announced her retirement from performing. She then committed herself to nurture young artists, and serving as a judge in several singing competitions. Her final performance was in Ballarat, Australia, in October 2016, but she did not announce her retirement until September 2017.

In 2021, she moved back to New Zealand permanently after having lived in the United Kingdom for 55 years. She was part of the official New Zealand delegation to the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.

== Initiatives ==

=== Kiri Te Kanawa Foundation ===
Te Kanawa established the Kiri Te Kanawa Foundation in order that &quot;talented young New Zealand singers and musicians with complete dedication to their art may receive judicious and thoughtful mentoring and support to assist them in realising their dreams.&quot; The foundation manages a trust fund that awards scholarships to young New Zealand singers and musicians.

=== Kiri Prize ===
In January 2010, Te Kanawa and BBC Radio 2 launched an initiative to find a gifted opera singer of the future. The initiative was the BBC Radio 2 Kiri Prize competition.

Following regional auditions of over 600 aspiring opera singers, 40 were invited to attend masterclasses in London with Te Kanawa, mezzo-soprano Anne Howells and conductor Robin Stapleton. From these classes 15 singers were selected for the semi-finals, which were broadcast on 5 consecutive weeks on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Friday Night Is Music Night. The semi-finalists were accompanied by the BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by Martin Yates, Richard Balcombe and Roderick Dunk and their performances were judged by Te Kanawa, Howells, Stapleton and director John Cox.

Five singers reached the final, which was broadcast on Radio 2 on 3 September 2010. The winner, soprano Shuna Scott Sendall, performed with Te Kanawa and José Carreras at the BBC Proms in the Park in Hyde Park, London on 11 September 2010, and was given the opportunity to attend a three-week residential course at the Solti Te Kanawa Accademia in Italy.

==Views==

=== Māori welfare ===
In a 2003 interview with the Melbourne-based &quot;Herald Sun&quot;, Te Kanawa criticised the high rate of welfare dependence among the Māori people, angering some of her compatriots.

=== Operatic pop ===
Te Kanawa revealed her disapproval of operatic pop singers in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Canvas&quot; magazine of 23 February 2008, criticizing Hayley Westenra on the eve of her Starlight Symphony concert in the Auckland Domain.

Her comment was met with backlash from music critics and industry personnels, including producer Gray Bartlett, who discovered Westenra, and Katherine Jenkins via her spokesperson.

===Traditional Latin Mass===
On July 2, 2024, The Times published a letter to the editor, co-signed by Te Kanawa and numerous other Catholic and non-Catholic public figures, calling upon the Holy See to preserve what they describe as the &quot;magnificent&quot; cultural artifact of the Catholic Church&#x27;s Traditional Latin Mass. 

== Litigation ==
In 2007, the event management company Leading Edge sued Te Kanawa for breach of contract after she cancelled a concert with Australian singer John Farnham. She cancelled after learning that his fans sometimes threw their underwear on stage, which he would then proudly display. The court found that no contract had been made by the two parties, so Te Kanawa was not liable for damages, but Mittane, the company that employs and manages her, was ordered to reimburse Leading Edge A$130,000 for expenditures already incurred.

==Honours==
Te Kanawa was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to music, in the 1973 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, and was elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to opera, in the 1982 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. Appointed Officier des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government in 1988, she received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and was appointed to the Order of New Zealand in the 1995 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In the 1990 Australia Day Honours, she was appointed an Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia, for services to the arts, particularly opera, and to the community. In 2005, she received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the University of Bath. She was portrayed as Saint Cecilia on the stained glass window in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Dunedin, which was unveiled in October 2012.

Appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2018 Birthday Honours for services to music, Dame Kiri was invested by the Prince of Wales at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 20 December.

In November 2019, the ASB Theatre in the Aotea Centre was renamed the Kiri Te Kanawa Theatre in acknowledgement of the work she has done on the world stage and to mark her 75th birthday. Te Kanawa unveiled a plaque with the change before a gala held in her honour.

==Awards==
Te Kanawa was selected as Artist of the Year by &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine in 1982. On 10 June 2008 she received the Edison Classical Music Award during the Edison Classical Music Gala (formerly the Grand Gala du Disque) in the Ridderzaal in The Hague. In 2012, Te Kanawa was awarded a World Class New Zealand award in the Iconic New Zealander category.

In 2006, Te Kanawa was awarded the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Dame Julie Andrews during the 2006 International Achievement Summit in Los Angeles.

In 2010, she received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

<text>Conversano (Barese: ) is an ancient town and &quot;comune&quot; in the Metropolitan City of Bari, Apulia, south-eastern Italy. It is southeast of Bari and from the Adriatic coast, at above sea level.

The counts of Conversano owned a stud that they used to breed black Neapolitan stallions with Barb and Andalusian genetic backgrounds: these horses had strong ram-like heads, short backs, and broad hocks. One horse born in 1767, Conversano, became one of the principal stallions for establishing the Lipizzan horses (&quot;Lipizzaner&quot;).

==History==

The town of Conversano was settled as early as the Iron Age, when the Iapygians or the Peucetians founded Norba. Later, as evidenced by the 6th-century BC necropolis, it became a flourishing trade town that was influenced by the nearby Greek colonies. Norba was conquered by the Romans in 268 BC and seems to have been abandoned around the time of the Visigothic invasion of Italy in 410–411.

The toponym, &quot;Casale Cupersanem&quot;, is known from the 5th century AD and was a bishopric seat from the 7th century. This new town gained importance when, in 1054, the Norman lord Geoffrey, assumed the title of &quot;Count of Conversano&quot; and turned Conversano into the capital of a large county that extended to Lecce and Nardò. After the count&#x27;s death in 1101, the county was inherited by his sons Robert and Alexander. In 1132, defeated by Roger II of Sicily, Alexander fled to Dalmatia, and the county was assigned to Robert I of Basseville, who was succeeded by his son Robert II. After a period of royal sovereignty, Conversano was a possession of Bernardino Gentile and of the Brienne, the Enghien, Luxembourg, Sanseverino, Barbiano, Orsini, Caldora and Orsini del Balzo families. In 1455, Giovanni Antonio del Balzo Orsini died; the county was inherited by his daughter Catherine, whose husband, Giulio Antonio Acquaviva, started the long rule of the Acquaviva family, which lasted until the early 19th century.

In 1690 the town was struck by plague and decimated. Feudalism was abolished in 1806.

In 1921, a local socialist deputy, Giuseppe Di Vagno, was assassinated in Mola di Bari by Fascist militia.

==Main sights==
Conversano&#x27;s main attraction is the medieval Castle, which dates from the period of Norman-Hohenstaufen rule in the Kingdom of Sicily. The castle is located on a hill overlooking the city, and probably dates from the Gothic Wars (6th century), although it was rebuilt from the 11th century. It has a single round tower that was added by Giulio Antonio Acquaviva.

The Romanesque cathedral is the see of the diocese of Conversano-Monopoli. It was built in the 11th century but received new decor in the 14th and, in Baroque style, in the 17th centuries. The exterior is in Romanesque style with a large 15th-century rose window and three portals, the middle one having sculpted decoration. The floor plan is T-shaped with two eastbound apses; the aisles are characterized by matronea and, in the left one, a 15th-century fresco from the Pisan school. The church houses the icon of the &quot;Madonna della Fonte&quot;, protector of the city.

The Benedictine Monastery, founded, according to tradition, in the 6th century, was once one of the most powerful in Apulia. In 1266, the Benedictines were replaced by a group of Cistercian nuns from Greece. It was the only convent in western Europe that allowed nuns to wear male religious symbols, such as the mitre. The church has maintained part of the 11th-century structure, while the decorated side entrance is from 1658. The interior has a nave and two aisles, with Baroque decor, and two canvasses by Paolo Finoglio. The crypt, dedicated to San Mauro, is from the 11th century. The bell tower rises higher than that of the cathedral, to symbolize the superior status of the nuns over the local bishop.

Other landmarks include the megalithic walls (6th century BC) erected by the Pelasgi, the Baroque church of SS. Cosma e Damiano, the church of St. Francis (1289), and, 1 km outside the city, the church of St. Catherine (c. 12th century). In the neighborhood are the church of &quot;Santa Maria dell&#x27;Isola&quot; (1462, enlarged in 1530), the Castle of Marchione (an 18th-century country residence of the Acquaviva), and the ruins of Castiglione (13th-16th centuries).

==Sport==
The local handball team won the national league in the 2002–03 2003–04 2005–06 2009–10 seasons.

<text>Main-Spessart is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the northwest of Bavaria, Germany. It is located in Lower Franconia and derives its name from the river Main and the wooded hills of the Spessart.

==Geography==
The district is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Bad Kissingen, Schweinfurt and Würzburg, the state of Baden-Württemberg (district of Main-Tauber), the districts of Miltenberg and Aschaffenburg, and the state of Hesse (district of Main-Kinzig).

The river Main forms a large horse-shoe bend in the district, entering in the southeast near Thüngersheim and leaving to the southwest near Hasloch. In the north it is joined by the Franconian Saale river at Gemünden. The Spessart hills cover most of the area of the district west and north of the Main. To the northeast, the district borders on the Rhön hills.

==History==
The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Gemünden, Karlstadt, Lohr and Marktheidenfeld. Although Lohr is the largest town, the seat of the administration is located in Karlstadt.

== Politics ==

* Main-Spessart (electoral district)

==Economy==
In 2017 (latest data available) the GDP per inhabitant was €36,264. This places the district 44th out of 96 districts (rural and urban) in Bavaria (overall average: €46,698).

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* a wheel symbolising the clerical state of Mainz
* the arms of the bishopric of Würzburg
* an oak leaf representing the forests of the area
* a bunch of grapes symbolising viticulture
* a wavy line representing the river Main

<text>The ClueFinders is an educational software series aimed at children aged 8–12 that features a group of mystery-solving teenagers. The series was created by The Learning Company (formerly SoftKey) as a counterpart to their &quot;Reader Rabbit&quot; series for older, elementary-aged students. The series has received praise for its balance of education and entertainment, resulting in numerous awards.

== History ==
=== The Learning Company (1998–2001) ===
&quot;The ClueFinders&quot; was conceived as a spiritual successor to the &quot;Reader Rabbit&quot; series. The first &quot;ClueFinders&quot; title, &quot;The ClueFinders 3rd Grade Adventures: The Mystery of Mathra&quot;, was released in January 1998, and &quot;The ClueFinders 4th Grade Adventures&quot; was released in July. The Learning Company used their new game as the prototype for Internet Applet technology, which allowed users to download supplementary activities from the &quot;ClueFinders&quot; website. &quot;The ClueFinders 4th Grade Adventures&quot; was also the first game to include the A.D.A.P.T. technology, which allowed teachers and parents to monitor the player&#x27;s progress and included auto-adjustable levels based on the player&#x27;s abilities.

In 1999, The Learning Company was acquired by Mattel for $3.7 billion. The following year, Mattel sold off its &quot;The Learning Company&quot; assets to Gores Technology Group. In 2000, Mattel Interactive hired professional writers Jill Gorey and Barbara Herndon to design a concept for a TV series, but the franchise never made its way to television. &quot;The ClueFinders Reading Adventures&quot; was discontinued in 2000. &quot;ClueFinders&quot; held a writing competition in 2001. Sponsored by The Learning Company, the competition was open to 3rd-6th grade classrooms in the United States. The winning essay, a new adventure for the &quot;ClueFinders&quot; crew, won its writer an iMac.

=== Riverdeep/HMH (2001–2021) ===
In 2001, Riverdeep acquired many of The Learning Company&#x27;s properties from Gores Technology Group by selling $40 million in stock. &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot;, &quot;ClueFinders&quot;, and &quot;Reader Rabbit&quot; were then licensed to the KidsEdge Website in 2002, where they were available to play among 170 games and activities. In 2003, &quot;The ClueFinders&#x27; Reading Adventures&quot; was reconfigured to run on Windows XP. The 2004 RCN InterACTION service allowed parents to stream over 35 games in series such as &quot;Carmen Sandiego&quot;, &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot;, and &quot;ClueFinders&quot; over a broadband connection. Compilations of multiple previously released titles were added, such as &quot;ClueFinders Adventure Pack&quot; and &quot;ClueFinders Triple Pack&quot;. These bundles often include a single ClueFinders title (often &quot;The ClueFinders Reading Adventures&quot;) along with other games (but mostly The Learning Company games), such as &quot;Adventure Workshop&quot; or &quot;After School Clubhouse&quot;. In addition, the 3rd–6th grade titles were re-released on the iOS platform on December 19, 2010. As of 2017, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (the successor of Riverdeep) was offering the &quot;ClueFinders&quot; brand as a licensing opportunity on its website.

=== HarperCollins (2021–present) ===
In 2021, HarperCollins Publishers, a subsidiary of News Corp, purchased Houghton Mifflin Harcourt&#x27;s books and media division, including all the rights to their video game intellectual properties.

== Design ==
=== Plot ===
Development of the games&#x27; backstory took 16 months. The &quot;ClueFinders&quot; adventures take place in the real contemporary world, incorporating some elements of fantasy and science fiction.

The main cast of characters include:
* Joni Savage (Josie Savage in UK version): ClueFinders founder, her catchphrase is &quot;Wow&quot; whenever something incredible happens.
* Santiago Rivera (Sebastian Robertson in the UK version), a Spanish-American mechanically-minded member.
* Owen Lam, an Asian-American skater dude member.
* Leslie Clark (Lucy Clark in the UK version), an African-American literary-minded member.
* LapTrap, The Turbo T.U.R.T.L.E.: A floating artificially intelligent laptop. During &quot;The Incredible Toy Store Adventure&quot; Laptrap is joined by a second spherical Turbo T.U.R.T.L.E. called AliTrap. The gameplay has him acting as the pause menu.
* Socrates is an intelligent dog who acts as the narrator and mascot. He only appears in the first two games. 

They were chosen to be around the same age as their player base after the art director ran various character designs by a group of kids. Some of the unsuccessful designs included animals, rock stars, and FBI agents, which the kids perceived as babysitters instead of teammates. Each character was designed with a distinct personality and identifiable faults to increase their relatability. The developers used a character grid to aid their writing, which contained information such as &quot;their flaws, their fears, how they met, where they grew up, and their likely reactions to certain situations&quot;.

In The ClueFinders 3rd Grade Adventures: The Mystery of Mathra, a great city was built 1000 years ago in the fictional Numerian rainforest in South America until a dragonlike monster named Mathra invaded. After Mathra was captured, the Numerians abandoned their city, sealed the entrance, and hid the two halves of the key in the far corners of the rainforest. One part was hidden in the Monkey Kingdom and the latter in the Goo Lagoon. Animals had started to disappear in the rainforest once again and Joni&#x27;s uncle, Dr. Pythagoras, also disappeared. Mr. Limburger (Lindman in the UK version) flies the ClueFinders in his airplane and briefs them on the events going on. The ClueFinders set off to find the lost doctor, animals, and the keys to the Lost Numerian City, but the evidence suggests that there is more to the disappearances than a 1000-year-old monster as well as a sinister plot behind it.

In The ClueFinders 4th Grade Adventures: Puzzle of the Pyramid, the ClueFinders are on an adventure in Egypt with Professor Botch, Alistair Loveless, and their dog, Socrates. There, at a dig site, they uncover the tomb of Peribsen, a king from the second dynasty. Joni finds a mysterious ring and tries it on her finger, but it magically latches onto her finger. Later that night, Alistair Loveless and his goons kidnap Professor Botch and steal several valuable relics. Loveless intends to unleash Set, the Egyptian God of Evil and Chaos. The ClueFinders are left to recover the relics, rescue Professor Botch, and prevent Loveless and Set from wreaking havoc.

In The ClueFinders 5th Grade Adventures: Secret of the Living Volcano, the ClueFinders are on a mission with Captain Clark, Leslie&#x27;s sailor grandfather, to find out why so many ships have been disappearing in a certain area of the Pacific Ocean. In one of the wrecked ships, Joni and Santiago discover a pair of metal plaques with strange symbols written on them called CrypTiles. When their ship comes into view of a tiny uncharted island, a tsunami promptly forms and hits their ship. Joni, Santiago, and LapTrap are stranded on the island and set off to rescue their remaining team members, locate Captain Clark and his crew, and find out what sort of activities are happening on the island.

In The ClueFinders 6th Grade Adventures: The Empire of the Plant People, while playing a game of frisbee, Joni accidentally tosses the disc over the fence into the overgrown yard of their friendly neighbour, Miss Rose. When Joni and Santiago enter Miss Rose&#x27;s yard to find the frisbee, the ground opens up and swallows them. Owen, Leslie, and LapTrap investigate to look for their lost team members and find a labyrinth under the yard inhabited by self-aware, anthropomorphic talking plants. They learn from a friendly plant named Ficus that the plants have captured Joni and Santiago and are concocting a plan to attack the town above.

In The ClueFinders Math Adventures Ages 9–12: Mystery in the Himalayas, in a village high in the Himalayas, twenty-four priceless treasures have been stolen. An elder of the village calls the ClueFinders to help uncover the treasures and the thief&#x27;s identity. Many, including the elder&#x27;s pessimistic apprentice, believe the Yeti is behind the theft, but the clues all point in different directions and it appears a different person is responsible for the theft of each item.

In The ClueFinders Reading Adventures: Mystery of the Missing Amulet, an asteroid has crashed in the Sierra Mountains. The ClueFinders approach the asteroid, discovering it is significantly cool despite its recent crash. Joni touches it, and the ClueFinders get beamed across space, arriving on the planet Millenia. The team is separated into two parts of the Millennia. Joni and Owen then meet Malveera, the princess of Millenia who brought them to help save her planet from the evil sorceress Malicia, who has also captured Santiago and Leslie. The only way to stop her and return to Earth is to locate the two halves of the Amulet of Life hidden by the Doldreks and the Sorrens.

In ClueFinders Search and Solve Adventures: The Phantom Amusement Park, one night, when the ClueFinders are observing a lunar eclipse from their clubhouse, they see an SOS signal coming from an abandoned amusement park on the edge of town. They find Jacques Ramone, the curator of the local art museum, trapped at the top of the drop-tower ride. He tells them that he was kidnapped and placed there, but says he doesn&#x27;t know why. After Joni and Owen rescue the curator, Santiago and Leslie are captured by the curator&#x27;s sister, Mimi Ramone. Joni and Owen investigate the park and find some art supplies and damaged robots, indicating that some art forgery crime was taking place.

In The ClueFinders: The Incredible Toy Store Adventure, the ClueFinders are heading on a San Francisco cable car to the recently built toy store, Ultimate Toys. Owen goes to retrieve his wallet, along with Joni and LapTrap, while Leslie, Santiago, and AliTrap head into the store, only to be shot by a shrinking ray and captured into a sack. Once they escape from the sack, they realize they&#x27;ve been taken to the sixth floor. Using Owen&#x27;s red video phone, they contact Leslie and Santiago and inform them of their plight, prompting Leslie and Santiago to try to rescue them. To do this Owen, Joni, and LapTrap need to make their way into the toy store and construct a machine to reverse the shrinking effects while nabbing the perpetrator responsible for the shrinking them. While investigating, The Cluefinders discover that employee Pericles Lear has stolen a prototype shrink-ray device and has started shrinking various landmarks around town.

In The ClueFinders: Mystery Mansion Arcade, the ClueFinders explore a creepy house on a hill, thinking that Joni&#x27;s uncle Dr. Horace Pythagoras sent a distress email that he was trapped in the house and needed rescue. It turns out to be a trap, and the four ClueFinders are separated. Four of the ClueFinders&#x27; previous enemies—Fletcher Limburger, Alistair Loveless, Pericles Lear, and Miss Rose—have joined forces with a mysterious new ally and created the trap to get revenge on the ClueFinders.

=== Gameplay ===
The series consists of &quot;multi-subject by grade&quot; programs, in which players practice skills and advance their understanding of grade-based content. The player can choose to play the adventure mode or to play the game&#x27;s activities outside the adventure in &quot;practice mode&quot;. Choosing to play the adventure will lead to a follow-up sequence, which further establishes the premise as well as the overall goal of the game. The bulk of each game involves traveling between different screens in a predetermined area that has various educational activities. The user will have to play these games to advance. Usually, each area will have one activity that needs to be completed to advance, but which can only be played by collecting items from all the other activities in the area.

In all of the games except for &quot;The ClueFinders 4th Grade Adventures&quot;, the ClueFinders are split into two teams at the start. A portable red videophone allows the two teams to make contact with each other and clicking on the phone provides the user with game hints from the other team. The other team will typically either be serving as backup, looking for clues, or else be captured and in need of rescue. Games have different activities divided among different areas, each with their skill and goal. The games contain several parodies of and allusions to popular culture and other topics.

In &quot;The ClueFinders: Mystery Mansion Arcade&quot;, the activities are not as educationally based as the previous games but more arcade-oriented. The mini-games consist of an obstacle course, category matching, a maze game, and a pinball game. In &quot;The ClueFinders Math Adventures&quot;, the game is set up similarly to &quot;Clue&quot; in that the central goal of each round is to identify three variables—who stole the treasure, which treasure they took, and where they hid it—based on clues. Clues are acquired from playing games and helping the villagers with their work. Using the acquired clues, the player can limit the number of possibilities until, with enough clues, only one remains. When 24 treasures are restored, the game is won.

=== Graphics and coding ===
During the gameplay, 2D computer graphics are used in the style of hand-drawn animated cartoons with animations that use thick outlines and solid colors on two-dimensional backgrounds. For this reason, the series is often described as imitating the look of a Saturday morning cartoon, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; being repeatedly cited by reviewers. Cutscenes, however, use pre-rendered 3D graphics.

=== Educational goals ===
While &quot;Reader Rabbit&quot; was popular with younger audiences, The Learning Company came up with &quot;ClueFinders&quot; to appeal to third graders and onward for both boys and girls. To match with kids&#x27; abstract thinking, the games were activity-centered and included cross-curriculum topics more sophisticated than preschool material, which included algebra, grammar, and spelling. To ensure that users learned something, the educational content came first before the puzzles, gameplay, and objectives.

Two &quot;ClueFinders&quot; books - &quot;The Mystery of Microsneezia&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of the Backlot Banshee&quot; - were both written by Ellen Weiss and illustrated by Mel Friedman.

== Reception ==

&quot;3rd Grade&quot; won the 1998 Gold Award from Parents&#x27; Choice. During the Opening Day of the Bologna Children&#x27;s Book Fair on April 8, 1999, the game was awarded the Bologna New Media Prize for the Best Logical Thinking Program.

&quot;Computer Shopper&quot; and &quot;SuperKids&quot; described &quot;3rd Grade Adventures&quot; as the educational equivalent of the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogy. &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; thought &quot;4th Grade Adventures&quot; &quot;works hard for its players&#x27; enjoyment&quot;. &quot;Discovery Education&quot; wrote that &quot;5th Grade Adventures&quot; &quot;seamlessly combines fun and learning&quot;. &quot;SuperKids&quot; praised the &quot;cartoon quality animation and an alluring storyline&quot; of &quot;Math Adventures&quot; and the Cluedo-inspired gameplay. 01Net asserted that in terms of &quot;5th Grade Adventures&quot;, the activities take precedence over the merely incidental storyline. In 2001, the site described the series&#x27; graphics as &quot;very colorful&quot; and &quot;truly seductive&quot; but three years later the site decided they were outdated. Asbury Park Press noted that &quot;Reading Adventures&quot;, like &quot;Carmen Sandiego Word Detective&quot;, &quot;placed reading games in the middle of mysteries&quot;.

&quot;Exploring Values Through Literature, Multimedia, and Literacy Events&quot; highlighted the series for its multicultural and balanced cast in which the nonwhite characters have equal status to the white character, noting that Leslie and Santiago are the main sources of knowledge, but also noted that there were no examples of software with the primary character being non-white. Meanwhile, &quot;The Boston Herald&quot; commented that the series had &quot;come a long way&quot;; the paper suggested that the decision to include a Caucasian (Joni), Asian (Owen), Black (Leslie), and Latino (Santiago) in its main cast smelt of interference from the California School Board standard. The paper praised the series&#x27; &quot;television-quality animation, broad educational focus, and lively situations&quot;, though thought the early games were uneven in difficulty. &quot;Exploring Values Through Literature, Multimedia, and Literacy Events&quot; further praised the series&#x27; focus on character interdependence, or how missions are not successful until and unless they work together. &quot;Children&#x27;s Software Review&quot; managing editor Ellen Wolock criticized The Learning Company for focusing too much of its resources on repackaging its old software, commenting that she received the impression the company was &quot;just throwing together&quot; entries in its newer &quot;ClueFinders&quot; series. &quot;Working Mother&quot; thought the series offered a &quot;painless way for kids to hone their skills&quot;. The Cincinnati Enquirer recommended the &quot;strong&quot; series to gamers who were unable to locate the then soon-to-be-discontinued title &quot;The Sims: Livin&#x27; Large&quot;, and said &quot;there is a lot to like&quot; about entries in the series, such as the closed captioning of later titles.

One piece of research used the game as a &quot;tool for assessing how children worked on computers in social interactions and influence acceptance by peers in classroom interactions&quot;. The &quot;Times Shepperton&quot; felt &quot;4th Grade&quot; did a &quot;nice job of integrating the learning activities into an engaging adventure&quot;. &quot;Battle Creek Enquirer&quot; and &quot;The Tennessean&quot; felt &quot;4th Grade&quot;″s strong sense of mystery encouraged players to learn academia. &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; felt &quot;Search and Solve&quot; would intrigue children due to having the right mix of &quot;scariness and intrigue&quot;.

&quot;4th Grade&quot; received positive reviews. &quot;All Game Guide&quot; gave the game four out of five stars, writing that &quot;the cut-scenes successfully build excitement, providing an incentive for completing the entire game [though there is no] real reason to play a second time... Gameplay is simple with an easy to use click or click-and-drag mouse control scheme, and the lack of a written manual is overcome with full explanations of all activities within the game...The game seems a delightful mix of adventure and learning&quot;. Game Vortex rated the game 80/100, saying that &quot;&quot;Clue Finders 4th Grade Adventure: Puzzle of the Pyramid&quot; is a typical edutainment game that teaches your child the ins and outs of what he or she needs to know to make it through the fourth grade&quot;. 7Wolf Magazine rated the game 70/100.

&quot;Reading Adventures&quot; gave mixed reviews. Although they said that teacher reviewers were especially impressed with the reading comprehension section&quot;, they felt that &quot;too many of the [activities] require fast-twitch gaming ability in addition to knowledge of the subject matter&quot;. Of the kids&#x27; appeal, the review stated that &quot;the activities themselves, however, are inconsistent. While some are novel and quite educational...others are tired repeats of games seen many times over in many other programs&quot;. It concluded by saying that &quot;this likable &quot;Clue Finders&quot; adventure provides an entertaining way for kids to practice their reading and language skills. Students who need significant help with their reading skills would do better with a more academically oriented title, and those who are not adept gamers may become frustrated with some of the activities&quot;.

=== Commercial performance ===
As of 2001, the first six games have sold around 3.5 million copies.

=== Awards and nominations ===

Since its creation in 1998, the &quot;ClueFinders&quot; series has won over 50 awards and accolades in three years. The Incredible Toy Store was an Edutaining Kids General Learning software pick of 2001.

<doc id="378938" wikidata="Q3634419" url="?curid=378938" title="Magnesium in biology">
<text>Magnesium is an essential element in biological systems. Magnesium occurs typically as the Mg2+ ion. It is an essential mineral nutrient (i.e., element) for life and is present in every cell type in every organism. For example, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main source of energy in cells, must bind to a magnesium ion in order to be biologically active. What is called ATP is often actually Mg-ATP. As such, magnesium plays a role in the stability of all polyphosphate compounds in the cells, including those associated with the synthesis of DNA and RNA.

Over 300 enzymes require the presence of magnesium ions for their catalytic action, including &quot;all&quot; enzymes utilizing or synthesizing ATP, or those that use other nucleotides to synthesize DNA and RNA.

In plants, magnesium is necessary for synthesis of chlorophyll and photosynthesis.

==Function==
A balance of magnesium is vital to the well-being of all organisms. Magnesium is a relatively abundant ion in Earth&#x27;s crust and mantle and is highly bioavailable in the hydrosphere. This availability, in combination with a useful and very unusual chemistry, may have led to its utilization in evolution as an ion for signaling, enzyme activation, and catalysis. However, the unusual nature of ionic magnesium has also led to a major challenge in the use of the ion in biological systems. Biological membranes are impermeable to magnesium (and other ions), so transport proteins must facilitate the flow of magnesium, both into and out of cells and intracellular compartments.

=== Human health ===
Inadequate magnesium intake frequently causes muscle spasms, and has been associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety disorders, migraines, osteoporosis, and cerebral infarction. Acute deficiency (see hypomagnesemia) is rare, and is more common as a drug side-effect (such as chronic alcohol or diuretic use) than from low food intake per se, but it can occur in people fed intravenously for extended periods of time.

The most common symptom of excess oral magnesium intake is diarrhea. Supplements based on amino acid chelates (such as glycinate, lysinate etc.) are much better-tolerated by the digestive system and do not have the side-effects of the older compounds used, while sustained-release dietary supplements prevent the occurrence of diarrhea. Since the kidneys of adult humans excrete excess magnesium efficiently, oral magnesium poisoning in adults with normal renal function is very rare. Infants, which have less ability to excrete excess magnesium even when healthy, should not be given magnesium supplements, except under a physician&#x27;s care.

Pharmaceutical preparations with magnesium are used to treat conditions including magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia, as well as eclampsia. Such preparations are usually in the form of magnesium sulfate or chloride when given parenterally. Magnesium is absorbed with reasonable efficiency (30% to 40%) by the body from any soluble magnesium salt, such as the chloride or citrate. Magnesium is similarly absorbed from Epsom salts, although the sulfate in these salts adds to their laxative effect at higher doses. Magnesium absorption from the insoluble oxide and hydroxide salts (milk of magnesia) is erratic and of poorer efficiency, since it depends on the neutralization and solution of the salt by the acid of the stomach, which may not be (and usually is not) complete.

Magnesium orotate may be used as adjuvant therapy in patients on optimal treatment for severe congestive heart failure, increasing survival rate and improving clinical symptoms and patient&#x27;s quality of life.

In 2022, magnesium salts were the 207th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

====Nerve conduction====
Magnesium can affect muscle relaxation through direct action on cell membranes. Mg2+ ions close certain types of calcium channels, which conduct positively charged calcium ions into neurons. With an excess of magnesium, more channels will be blocked and nerve cells activity will decrease.

====Hypertension====
Intravenous magnesium sulphate is used in treating pre-eclampsia. For other than pregnancy-related hypertension, a meta-analysis of 22 clinical trials with dose ranges of 120 to 973 mg/day and a mean dose of 410 mg, concluded that magnesium supplementation had a small but statistically significant effect, lowering systolic blood pressure by 3–4 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 2–3 mm Hg. The effect was larger when the dose was more than 370 mg/day.

====Diabetes and glucose tolerance====
Higher dietary intakes of magnesium correspond to lower diabetes incidence. For people with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes, magnesium supplementation lowers fasting glucose.

=== Mitochondria ===

Magnesium is essential as part of the process that generates adenosine triphosphate.

Mitochondria are often referred to as the &quot;powerhouses of the cell&quot; because their primary role is generating energy for cellular processes. They achieve this by breaking down nutrients, primarily glucose, through a series of chemical reactions known as cellular respiration. This process ultimately produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell&#x27;s main energy currency.

=== Vitamin D ===

Magnesium and vitamin D have a synergistic relationship in the body, meaning they work together to optimize each other&#x27;s functions:

* Magnesium activates vitamin D
* Vitamin D influences magnesium absorption.
* Bone health: They play crucial roles in calcium absorption and bone metabolism.
* Muscle function: They contribute to muscle contraction and relaxation, impacting physical performance and overall well-being.
* Immune function: They support a healthy immune system and may help reduce inflammation.

Overall, maintaining adequate levels of both magnesium and vitamin D is essential for optimal health and well-being.

=== Testosterone ===
It is theorized that the process of making testosterone from cholesterol, needs magnesium to function properly.

Studies have shown that significant gains in testosterone occur after taking 10 mg magnesium/kg body weight/day.

==Dietary recommendations==
The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for magnesium in 1997. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current EARs for magnesium for women and men ages 31 and up are 265 mg/day and 350 mg/day, respectively. The RDAs are 320 and 420 mg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 350 to 400 mg/day depending on age of the woman. RDA for lactation ranges 310 to 360 mg/day for same reason. For children ages 1–13 years, the RDA increases with age from 65 to 200 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of magnesium the UL is set at 350 mg/day. The UL is specific to magnesium consumed as a dietary supplement, the reason being that too much magnesium consumed at one time can cause diarrhea. The UL does not apply to food-sourced magnesium. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes.
* = Adequate intake

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For women and men ages 18 and older, the AIs are set at 300 and 350 mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation are also 300 mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, the AIs increase with age from 170 to 250 mg/day. These AIs are lower than the U.S. RDAs. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 250 mg/day lower than the U.S. value. The magnesium UL is unique in that it is lower than some of the RDAs. It applies to intake from a pharmacological agent or dietary supplement only and does not include intake from food and water.

===Labeling===
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value (%DV). For magnesium labeling purposes, 100% of the daily value was 400 mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 420 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake.

== Food sources ==

Green vegetables such as spinach provide magnesium because of the abundance of chlorophyll molecules, which contain the ion. Nuts (especially Brazil nuts, cashews and almonds), seeds (e.g., pumpkin seeds), dark chocolate, roasted soybeans, bran, and some whole grains are also good sources of magnesium.

Although many foods contain magnesium, it is usually found in low levels. As with most nutrients, daily needs for magnesium are unlikely to be met by one serving of any single food. Eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains will help ensure adequate intake of magnesium.

Because magnesium readily dissolves in water, refined foods, which are often processed or cooked in water and dried, in general, are poor sources of the nutrient. For example, whole-wheat bread has twice as much magnesium as white bread because the magnesium-rich germ and bran are removed when white flour is processed. The table of food sources of magnesium suggests many dietary sources of magnesium.

&quot;Hard&quot; water can also provide magnesium, but &quot;soft&quot; water contains less of the ion. Dietary surveys do not assess magnesium intake from water, which may lead to underestimating total magnesium intake and its variability.

Too much magnesium may make it difficult for the body to absorb calcium. Not enough magnesium can lead to hypomagnesemia as described above, with irregular heartbeats, high blood pressure (a sign in humans but not some experimental animals such as rodents), insomnia, and muscle spasms (fasciculation). However, as noted, symptoms of low magnesium from pure dietary deficiency are thought to be rarely encountered.

Following are some foods and the amount of magnesium in them:

* Pumpkin seeds, no hulls ( cup) = 303 mg
*Chia seeds, ( cup) = 162 mg

* Whole wheat bread (1 slice) = 23 mg
==Biological range, distribution, and regulation==
In animals, it has been shown that different cell types maintain different concentrations of magnesium. It seems likely that the same is true for plants. This suggests that different cell types may regulate influx and efflux of magnesium in different ways based on their unique metabolic needs. Interstitial and systemic concentrations of free magnesium must be delicately maintained by the combined processes of buffering (binding of ions to proteins and other molecules) and muffling (the transport of ions to storage or extracellular spaces).

In plants, and more recently in animals, magnesium has been recognized as an important signaling ion, both activating and mediating many biochemical reactions. The best example of this is perhaps the regulation of carbon fixation in chloroplasts in the Calvin cycle.

Magnesium is very important in cellular function. Deficiency of the nutrient causes disease of the affected organism. In single-cell organisms such as bacteria and yeast, low levels of magnesium manifests in greatly reduced growth rates. In magnesium transport knockout strains of bacteria, healthy rates are maintained only with exposure to very high external concentrations of the ion. In yeast, mitochondrial magnesium deficiency also leads to disease.

Plants deficient in magnesium show stress responses. The first observable signs of both magnesium starvation and overexposure in plants is a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis. This is due to the central position of the Mg2+ ion in the chlorophyll molecule. The later effects of magnesium deficiency on plants are a significant reduction in growth and reproductive viability. Magnesium can also be toxic to plants, although this is typically seen only in drought conditions.

In animals, magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia) is seen when the environmental availability of magnesium is low. In ruminant animals, particularly vulnerable to magnesium availability in pasture grasses, the condition is known as &#x27;grass tetany&#x27;. Hypomagnesemia is identified by a loss of balance due to muscle weakness. A number of genetically attributable hypomagnesemia disorders have also been identified in humans.

Overexposure to magnesium may be toxic to individual cells, though these effects have been difficult to show experimentally. Hypermagnesemia, an overabundance of magnesium in the blood, is usually caused by loss of kidney function. Healthy animals rapidly excrete excess magnesium in the urine and stool. Urinary magnesium is called &quot;magnesuria&quot;. Characteristic concentrations of magnesium in model organisms are: in &quot;E. coli&quot; 30-100mM (bound), 0.01-1mM (free), in budding yeast 50mM, in mammalian cell 10mM (bound), 0.5mM (free) and in blood plasma 1mM.

==Biological chemistry==
Mg2+ is the fourth-most-abundant metal ion in cells (per moles) and the most abundant free divalent cation — as a result, it is deeply and intrinsically woven into cellular metabolism. Indeed, Mg2+-dependent enzymes appear in virtually every metabolic pathway: Specific binding of Mg2+ to biological membranes is frequently observed, Mg2+ is also used as a signalling molecule, and much of nucleic acid biochemistry requires Mg2+, including all reactions that require release of energy from ATP. In nucleotides, the triple-phosphate moiety of the compound is invariably stabilized by association with Mg2+ in all enzymatic processes.

===Chlorophyll===
In photosynthetic organisms, Mg2+ has the additional vital role of being the coordinating ion in the chlorophyll molecule. This role was discovered by Richard Willstätter, who received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1915 for the purification and structure of chlorophyll binding with sixth number of carbon

===Enzymes===
The chemistry of the Mg2+ ion, as applied to enzymes, uses the full range of this ion&#x27;s unusual reaction chemistry to fulfill a range of functions. Mg2+ interacts with substrates, enzymes, and occasionally both (Mg2+ may form part of the active site). In general, Mg2+ interacts with substrates through inner sphere coordination, stabilising anions or reactive intermediates, also including binding to ATP and activating the molecule to nucleophilic attack. When interacting with enzymes and other proteins, Mg2+ may bind using inner or outer sphere coordination, to either alter the conformation of the enzyme or take part in the chemistry of the catalytic reaction. In either case, because Mg2+ is only rarely fully dehydrated during ligand binding, it may be a water molecule associated with the Mg2+ that is important rather than the ion itself. The Lewis acidity of Mg2+ (p&quot;K&quot;a 11.4) is used to allow both hydrolysis and condensation reactions (most common ones being phosphate ester hydrolysis and phosphoryl transfer) that would otherwise require pH values greatly removed from physiological values.

=== Essential role in the biological activity of ATP ===
ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the main source of energy in cells, must be bound to a magnesium ion in order to be biologically active. What is called ATP is often actually Mg-ATP.

===Nucleic acids===
Nucleic acids have an important range of interactions with Mg2+. The binding of Mg2+ to DNA and RNA stabilises structure; this can be observed in the increased melting temperature (&quot;T&quot;m) of double-stranded DNA in the presence of Mg2+. In addition, ribosomes contain large amounts of Mg2+ and the stabilisation provided is essential to the complexation of this ribo-protein. A large number of enzymes involved in the biochemistry of nucleic acids bind Mg2+ for activity, using the ion for both activation and catalysis. Finally, the autocatalysis of many ribozymes (enzymes containing only RNA) is Mg2+ dependent (e.g. the yeast mitochondrial group II self splicing introns).

Magnesium ions can be critical in maintaining the positional integrity of closely clustered phosphate groups. These clusters appear in numerous and distinct parts of the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. For instance, hexahydrated Mg2+ ions bind in the deep major groove and at the outer mouth of A-form nucleic acid duplexes.

===Cell membranes and walls===
Biological cell membranes and cell walls are polyanionic surfaces. This has important implications for the transport of ions, in particular because it has been shown that different membranes preferentially bind different ions. Both Mg2+ and Ca2+ regularly stabilize membranes by the cross-linking of carboxylated and phosphorylated head groups of lipids. However, the envelope membrane of &quot;E. coli&quot; has also been shown to bind Na+, K+, Mn2+ and Fe3+. The transport of ions is dependent on both the concentration gradient of the ion and the electric potential (ΔΨ) across the membrane, which will be affected by the charge on the membrane surface. For example, the specific binding of Mg2+ to the chloroplast envelope has been implicated in a loss of photosynthetic efficiency by the blockage of K+ uptake and the subsequent acidification of the chloroplast stroma.

===Proteins===
The Mg2+ ion tends to bind only weakly to proteins (&quot;K&quot;a ≤ 105) and this can be exploited by the cell to switch enzymatic activity on and off by changes in the local concentration of Mg2+. Although the concentration of free cytoplasmic Mg2+ is on the order of 1 mmol/L, the total Mg2+ content of animal cells is 30 mmol/L and in plants the content of leaf endodermal cells has been measured at values as high as 100 mmol/L (Stelzer &quot;et al.&quot;, 1990), much of which buffered in storage compartments. The cytoplasmic concentration of free Mg2+ is buffered by binding to chelators (e.g., ATP), but also, what is more important, it is buffered by storage of Mg2+ in intracellular compartments. The transport of Mg2+ between intracellular compartments may be a major part of regulating enzyme activity. The interaction of Mg2+ with proteins must also be considered for the transport of the ion across biological membranes.

===Manganese===
In biological systems, only manganese (Mn2+) is readily capable of replacing Mg2+, but only in a limited set of circumstances. Mn2+ is very similar to Mg2+ in terms of its chemical properties, including inner and outer shell complexation. Mn2+ effectively binds ATP and allows hydrolysis of the energy molecule by most ATPases. Mn2+ can also replace Mg2+ as the activating ion for a number of Mg2+-dependent enzymes, although some enzyme activity is usually lost. Sometimes such enzyme metal preferences vary among closely related species: For example, the reverse transcriptase enzyme of lentiviruses like HIV, SIV and FIV is typically dependent on Mg2+, whereas the analogous enzyme for other retroviruses prefers Mn2+.

==Measuring magnesium in biological samples==
===By radioactive isotopes===
The use of radioactive tracer elements in ion uptake assays allows the calculation of km, Ki and Vmax and determines the initial change in the ion content of the cells. 28Mg decays by the emission of a high-energy beta or gamma particle, which can be measured using a scintillation counter. However, the radioactive half-life of 28Mg, the most stable of the radioactive magnesium isotopes, is only 21 hours. This severely restricts the experiments involving the nuclide. Also, since 1990, no facility has routinely produced 28Mg, and the price per mCi is now predicted to be approximately US$30,000. The chemical nature of Mg2+ is such that it is closely approximated by few other cations. However, Co2+, Mn2+ and Ni2+ have been used successfully to mimic the properties of Mg2+ in some enzyme reactions, and radioactive forms of these elements have been employed successfully in cation transport studies. The difficulty of using metal ion replacement in the study of enzyme function is that the relationship between the enzyme activities with the replacement ion compared to the original is very difficult to ascertain.

===By fluorescent indicators===
A number of chelators of divalent cations have different fluorescence spectra in the bound and unbound states. Chelators for Ca2+ are well established, have high affinity for the cation, and low interference from other ions. Mg2+ chelators lag behind and the major fluorescence dye for Mg2+ (mag-fura 2) actually has a higher affinity for Ca2+. This limits the application of this dye to cell types where the resting level of Ca2+ is &lt; 1 μM and does not vary with the experimental conditions under which Mg2+ is to be measured. Recently, Otten &quot;et al.&quot; (2001) have described work into a new class of compounds that may prove more useful, having significantly better binding affinities for Mg2+. The use of the fluorescent dyes is limited to measuring the free Mg2+. If the ion concentration is buffered by the cell by chelation or removal to subcellular compartments, the measured rate of uptake will give only minimum values of km and Vmax.

===By electrophysiology===
First, ion-specific microelectrodes can be used to measure the internal free ion concentration of cells and organelles. The major advantages are that readings can be made from cells over relatively long periods of time, and that unlike dyes very little extra ion buffering capacity is added to the cells.

Second, the technique of two-electrode voltage-clamp allows the direct measurement of the ion flux across the membrane of a cell. The membrane is held at an electric potential and the responding current is measured. All ions passing across the membrane contribute to the measured current.

Third, the technique of patch-clamp uses isolated sections of natural or artificial membrane in much the same manner as voltage-clamp but without the secondary effects of a cellular system. Under ideal conditions the conductance of individual channels can be quantified. This methodology gives the most direct measurement of the action of ion channels.

===By absorption spectroscopy===
Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) determines the total magnesium content of a biological sample. This method is destructive; biological samples must be broken down in concentrated acids to avoid clogging the fine nebulising apparatus. Beyond this, the only limitation is that samples must be in a volume of approximately 2 mL and at a concentration range of 0.1 – 0.4 μmol/L for optimum accuracy. As this technique cannot distinguish between Mg2+ already present in the cell and that taken up during the experiment, only content not uptaken can be quantified.

Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) using either the mass spectrometry (MS) or atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) modifications also allows the determination of the total ion content of biological samples.

==Magnesium transport==
The chemical and biochemical properties of Mg2+ present the cellular system with a significant challenge when transporting the ion across biological membranes. The dogma of ion transport states that the transporter recognises the ion then progressively removes the water of hydration, removing most or all of the water at a selective pore before releasing the ion on the far side of the membrane. Due to the properties of Mg2+, large volume change from hydrated to bare ion, high energy of hydration and very low rate of ligand exchange in the inner coordination sphere, these steps are probably more difficult than for most other ions. To date, only the ZntA protein of Paramecium has been shown to be a Mg2+ channel. The mechanisms of Mg2+ transport by the remaining proteins are beginning to be uncovered with the first three-dimensional structure of a Mg2+ transport complex being solved in 2004.

The hydration shell of the Mg2+ ion has a very tightly bound inner shell of six water molecules and a relatively tightly bound second shell containing 12–14 water molecules (Markham &quot;et al.&quot;, 2002). Thus, it is presumed that recognition of the Mg2+ ion requires some mechanism to interact initially with the hydration shell of Mg2+, followed by a direct recognition/binding of the ion to the protein.

In spite of the mechanistic difficulty, Mg2+ must be transported across membranes, and a large number of Mg2+ fluxes across membranes from a variety of systems have been described. However, only a small selection of Mg2+ transporters have been characterised at the molecular level.

=== Ligand ion channel blockade ===
Magnesium ions (Mg2+) in cellular biology are usually in almost all senses opposite to Ca2+ ions, because they are bivalent too, but have greater electronegativity and thus exert greater pull on water molecules, preventing passage through the channel (even though the magnesium itself is smaller). Thus, Mg2+ ions block Ca2+ channels such as (NMDA channels) and have been shown to affect gap junction channels forming electrical synapses.

==Plant physiology of magnesium==
The previous sections have dealt in detail with the chemical and biochemical aspects of Mg2+ and its transport across cellular membranes. This section will apply this knowledge to aspects of whole plant physiology, in an attempt to show how these processes interact with the larger and more complex environment of the multicellular organism.

===Nutritional requirements and interactions===
Mg2+ is essential for plant growth and is present in higher plants in amounts on the order of 80 μmol g−1 dry weight. The amounts of Mg2+ vary in different parts of the plant and are dependent upon nutritional status. In times of plenty, excess Mg2+ may be stored in vascular cells (Stelzer &quot;et al.&quot;, 1990; and in times of starvation Mg2+ is redistributed, in many plants, from older to newer leaves.

Mg2+ is taken up into plants via the roots. Interactions with other cations in the rhizosphere can have a significant effect on the uptake of the ion.(Kurvits and Kirkby, 1980; The structure of root cell walls is highly permeable to water and ions, and hence ion uptake into root cells can occur anywhere from the root hairs to cells located almost in the centre of the root (limited only by the Casparian strip). Plant cell walls and membranes carry a great number of negative charges, and the interactions of cations with these charges is key to the uptake of cations by root cells allowing a local concentrating effect. Mg2+ binds relatively weakly to these charges, and can be displaced by other cations, impeding uptake and causing deficiency in the plant.

Within individual plant cells, the Mg2+ requirements are largely the same as for all cellular life; Mg2+ is used to stabilise membranes, is vital to the utilisation of ATP, is extensively involved in the nucleic acid biochemistry, and is a cofactor for many enzymes (including the ribosome). Also, Mg2+ is the coordinating ion in the chlorophyll molecule. It is the intracellular compartmentalisation of Mg2+ in plant cells that leads to additional complexity. Four compartments within the plant cell have reported interactions with Mg2+. Initially, Mg2+ will enter the cell into the cytoplasm (by an as yet unidentified system), but free Mg2+ concentrations in this compartment are tightly regulated at relatively low levels (≈2 mmol/L) and so any excess Mg2+ is either quickly exported or stored in the second intracellular compartment, the vacuole. The requirement for Mg2+ in mitochondria has been demonstrated in yeast and it seems highly likely that the same will apply in plants. The chloroplasts also require significant amounts of internal Mg2+, and low concentrations of cytoplasmic Mg2+. In addition, it seems likely that the other subcellular organelles (e.g., Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, etc.) also require Mg2+.

===Distributing magnesium ions within the plant===
Once in the cytoplasmic space of root cells Mg2+, along with the other cations, is probably transported radially into the stele and the vascular tissue. From the cells surrounding the xylem the ions are released or pumped into the xylem and carried up through the plant. In the case of Mg2+, which is highly mobile in both the xylem and phloem, the ions will be transported to the top of the plant and back down again in a continuous cycle of replenishment. Hence, uptake and release from vascular cells is probably a key part of whole plant Mg2+ homeostasis. Figure 1 shows how few processes have been connected to their molecular mechanisms (only vacuolar uptake has been associated with a transport protein, AtMHX).

The diagram shows a schematic of a plant and the putative processes of Mg2+ transport at the root and leaf where Mg2+ is loaded and unloaded from the vascular tissues. Mg2+ is taken up into the root cell wall space (1) and interacts with the negative charges associated with the cell walls and membranes. Mg2+ may be taken up into cells immediately (symplastic pathway) or may travel as far as the Casparian band (4) before being absorbed into cells (apoplastic pathway; 2). The concentration of Mg2+ in the root cells is probably buffered by storage in root cell vacuoles (3). Note that cells in the root tip do not contain vacuoles. Once in the root cell cytoplasm, Mg2+ travels toward the centre of the root by plasmodesmata, where it is loaded into the xylem (5) for transport to the upper parts of the plant. When the Mg2+ reaches the leaves it is unloaded from the xylem into cells (6) and again is buffered in vacuoles (7). Whether cycling of Mg2+ into the phloem occurs via general cells in the leaf (8) or directly from xylem to phloem via transfer cells (9) is unknown. Mg2+ may return to the roots in the phloem sap.
When a Mg2+ ion has been absorbed by a cell requiring it for metabolic processes, it is generally assumed that the ion stays in that cell for as long as the cell is active. In vascular cells, this is not always the case; in times of plenty, Mg2+ is stored in the vacuole, takes no part in the day-to-day metabolic processes of the cell (Stelzer &quot;et al.&quot;, 1990), and is released at need. But for most cells it is death by senescence or injury that releases Mg2+ and many of the other ionic constituents, recycling them into healthy parts of the plant. In addition, when Mg2+ in the environment is limiting, some species are able to mobilise Mg2+ from older tissues. These processes involve the release of Mg2+ from its bound and stored states and its transport back into the vascular tissue, where it can be distributed to the rest of the plant. In times of growth and development, Mg2+ is also remobilised within the plant as source and sink relationships change.

The homeostasis of Mg2+ within single plant cells is maintained by processes occurring at the plasma membrane and at the vacuole membrane (see Figure 2). The major driving force for the translocation of ions in plant cells is ΔpH. H+-ATPases pump H+ ions against their concentration gradient to maintain the pH differential that can be used for the transport of other ions and molecules. H+ ions are pumped out of the cytoplasm into the extracellular space or into the vacuole. The entry of Mg2+ into cells may occur through one of two pathways, via channels using the ΔΨ (negative inside) across this membrane or by symport with H+ ions. To transport the Mg2+ ion into the vacuole requires a Mg2+/H+ antiport transporter (such as AtMHX). The H+-ATPases are dependent on Mg2+ (bound to ATP) for activity, so that Mg2+ is required to maintain its own homeostasis.

A schematic of a plant cell is shown including the four major compartments currently recognised as interacting with Mg2+. H+-ATPases maintain a constant ΔpH across the plasma membrane and the vacuole membrane. Mg2+ is transported into the vacuole using the energy of ΔpH (in &quot;A. thaliana&quot; by AtMHX). Transport of Mg2+ into cells may use either the negative ΔΨ or the ΔpH. The transport of Mg2+ into mitochondria probably uses ΔΨ as in the mitochondria of yeast, and it is likely that chloroplasts take Mg2+ by a similar system. The mechanism and the molecular basis for the release of Mg2+ from vacuoles and from the cell is not known. Likewise, the light-regulated Mg2+ concentration changes in chloroplasts are not fully understood, but do require the transport of H+ ions across the thylakoid membrane.

===Magnesium, chloroplasts and photosynthesis===
Mg2+ is the coordinating metal ion in the chlorophyll molecule, and in plants where the ion is in high supply about 6% of the total Mg2+ is bound to chlorophyll. Thylakoid stacking is stabilised by Mg2+ and is important for the efficiency of photosynthesis, allowing phase transitions to occur.

Mg2+ is probably taken up into chloroplasts to the greatest extent during the light-induced development from proplastid to chloroplast or etioplast to chloroplast. At these times, the synthesis of chlorophyll and the biogenesis of the thylakoid membrane stacks absolutely require the divalent cation.

Whether Mg2+ is able to move into and out of chloroplasts after this initial developmental phase has been the subject of several conflicting reports. Deshaies &quot;et al.&quot; (1984) found that Mg2+ did move in and out of isolated chloroplasts from young pea plants, but Gupta and Berkowitz (1989) were unable to reproduce the result using older spinach chloroplasts. Deshaies &quot;et al.&quot; had stated in their paper that older pea chloroplasts showed less significant changes in Mg2+ content than those used to form their conclusions. The relative proportion of immature chloroplasts present in the preparations may explain these observations.

The metabolic state of the chloroplast changes considerably between night and day. During the day, the chloroplast is actively harvesting the energy of light and converting it into chemical energy. The activation of the metabolic pathways involved comes from the changes in the chemical nature of the stroma on the addition of light. H+ is pumped out of the stroma (into both the cytoplasm and the lumen) leading to an alkaline pH. Mg2+ (along with K+) is released from the lumen into the stroma, in an electroneutralisation process to balance the flow of H+. Finally, thiol groups on enzymes are reduced by a change in the redox state of the stroma. Examples of enzymes activated in response to these changes are fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose bisphosphatase and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase. During the dark period, if these enzymes were active a wasteful cycling of products and substrates would occur.

Two major classes of the enzymes that interact with Mg2+ in the stroma during the light phase can be identified. Firstly, enzymes in the glycolytic pathway most often interact with two atoms of Mg2+. The first atom is as an allosteric modulator of the enzymes&#x27; activity, while the second forms part of the active site and is directly involved in the catalytic reaction. The second class of enzymes includes those where the Mg2+ is complexed to nucleotide di- and tri-phosphates (ADP and ATP), and the chemical change involves phosphoryl transfer. Mg2+ may also serve in a structural maintenance role in these enzymes (e.g., enolase).

===Magnesium stress===

Plant stress responses can be observed in plants that are under- or over-supplied with Mg2+. The first observable signs of Mg2+ stress in plants for both starvation and toxicity is a depression of the rate of photosynthesis, it is presumed because of the strong relationships between Mg2+ and chloroplasts/chlorophyll. In pine trees, even before the visible appearance of yellowing and necrotic spots, the photosynthetic efficiency of the needles drops markedly. In Mg2+ deficiency, reported secondary effects include carbohydrate immobility, loss of RNA transcription and loss of protein synthesis. However, due to the mobility of Mg2+ within the plant, the deficiency phenotype may be present only in the older parts of the plant. For example, in Pinus radiata starved of Mg2+, one of the earliest identifying signs is the chlorosis in the needles on the lower branches of the tree. This is because Mg2+ has been recovered from these tissues and moved to growing (green) needles higher in the tree.

A Mg2+ deficit can be caused by the lack of the ion in the media (soil), but more commonly comes from inhibition of its uptake. Mg2+ binds quite weakly to the negatively charged groups in the root cell walls, so that excesses of other cations such as K+, NH4+, Ca2+, and Mn2+ can all impede uptake.(Kurvits and Kirkby, 1980; In acid soils Al3+ is a particularly strong inhibitor of Mg2+ uptake. The inhibition by Al3+ and Mn2+ is more severe than can be explained by simple displacement, hence it is possible that these ions bind to the Mg2+ uptake system directly. In bacteria and yeast, such binding by Mn2+ has already been observed. Stress responses in the plant develop as cellular processes halt due to a lack of Mg2+ (e.g. maintenance of ΔpH across the plasma and vacuole membranes). In Mg2+-starved plants under low light conditions, the percentage of Mg2+ bound to chlorophyll has been recorded at 50%. Presumably, this imbalance has detrimental effects on other cellular processes.

Mg2+ toxicity stress is more difficult to develop. When Mg2+ is plentiful, in general the plants take up the ion and store it (Stelzer &quot;et al.&quot;, 1990). However, if this is followed by drought then ionic concentrations within the cell can increase dramatically. High cytoplasmic Mg2+ concentrations block a K+ channel in the inner envelope membrane of the chloroplast, in turn inhibiting the removal of H+ ions from the chloroplast stroma. This leads to an acidification of the stroma that inactivates key enzymes in carbon fixation, which all leads to the production of oxygen free radicals in the chloroplast that then cause oxidative damage.

<text>Djivan Gasparyan (var. Jivan Gasparyan; , ; 12 October 1928 – 6 July 2021) was an Armenian musician and composer. He played the duduk, a double reed woodwind instrument related to the orchestral oboe. Gasparyan is known as the &quot;Master of the duduk&quot;. In 2006 he was nominated for Grammy awards for the Best Traditional World Music Album.

==Biography==
Born in Solak, Armenia, to parents from Mush, Gasparyan started to play duduk when he was six. In 1948, he became a soloist of the Armenian Song and Dance Popular Ensemble and the Yerevan Philharmonic Orchestra.

He won four medals at UNESCO worldwide competitions (1959, 1962, 1973, and 1980). In 1973 Gasparyan was awarded the honorary title &quot;People&#x27;s Artist of Armenia&quot;. 
In 2002, he received the WOMEX (&quot;World Music Expo&quot;) Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a Honorary citizen of Yerevan.

A professor at the Yerevan State Musical Conservatory, he instructed and nurtured many performers to professional levels of performance in duduk. In 1998, he released an album with a unique duduk quartet he formed. Creating arrangements for four musicians with &quot;new duduk tones, alto and bass, was an extremely difficult task&quot; and challenge, but the quartet did become a reality performing and &quot;there is no other like it in the world&quot;, he witnessed in the liner notes of &quot;Nazeli&quot;. He toured the world several times with a small ensemble playing Armenian folk music. His music has been chosen on the soundtrack of several international films.

He collaborated with many artists, such as Sting, Peter Gabriel, Hossein Alizadeh, Erkan Oğur, Michael Brook, Brian May, Lionel Richie, Derek Sherinian, Roman Miroshnichenko, Ludovico Einaudi, Boris Grebenshchikov, Brian Eno, David Sylvian, Hans Zimmer, and Andreas Vollenweider. He also recorded with the Kronos Quartet and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Gasparyan played as part of the Armenian entry &quot;Apricot Stone&quot; by Eva Rivas at the 2010 Eurovision Song Contest in Oslo and became the oldest ever person to feature in a Eurovision Song Contest performance, but was not officially listed as a guest artist.

==Death and legacy==
Gasparyan died on 6 July 2021, aged 92. It was announced by his grandson, Djivan Gasparyan Jr. He said &quot;The world has suffered an unimaginable loss tonight. He was not only a legend, but also a person with a beautiful soul. I write with great sorrow about my huge loss. May God keep your soul in the bright sky.&quot;

Peter Gabriel called Gasparyan &quot;the great master of the instrument.&quot; He added, &quot;When he lifted his duduk to his lips he cast a spell over all who listened.&quot;

Gasparyan was highly recognized by the Armenian government. On his 90th birthday, Armenia&#x27;s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan congratulated Gasparyan, stating: &quot;Our people and music lovers around the world have already ranked you among the world’s great musicians. As a living legend, you are a credit to all Armenians.&quot; Upon his death, President Armen Sarkissian described him as a &quot;legendary duduk player&quot; who was &quot;one of the pillars of our modern culture, whose name is associated with the creative and working activities of musicians, especially a whole generation of duduk players.&quot; Pashinyan called him &quot;an exceptional Armenian intellectual and ranked him among the Greats of the world art; we were proud and inspired by him.&quot;

Catholicos Karekin II, leader of the Armenian Apostolic Church, sent a letter of condolences to his family. &quot;For decades, he performed the gems of the Armenian music on many stages in Armenia and abroad, serving the grateful mission of recognizing and spreading our culture,&quot; read the statement.

<doc id="378941" wikidata="Q492841" url="?curid=378941" title="Boa (genus)">
<text>Boa is a genus of boas found in Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. Five extant species, and one extinct, are currently recognized.

==Etymology==
The Online Etymology Dictionary says that the word comes from the &quot;late 14c., &quot;large snake,&quot; from Latin boa, type of large serpent mentioned in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History;&quot; origin unknown (in medieval folk etymology the name was associated with Greek bous &quot;ox&quot;).&quot;
There might be a connection to the Albanian word bollë, from proto-Albanian *bālwā, meaning any of various nonvenomous snakes of the families Colubridae family, Boidae family or a kuçedër&#x27;s early form. 

==Species==

*) Not including the nominate subspecies.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Boa&quot; species are found in northern Mexico through Central America (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama) to South America north of 35°S (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay and Argentina). One species is present in the Lesser Antilles (Dominica and St. Lucia), on San Andrés, Providencia and many other islands along the Caribbean coasts of Mexico and Central and South America.

==Taxonomy==
Kluge (1991) moved the genera &quot;Sanzinia&quot; and &quot;Acrantophis&quot; into &quot;Boa&quot;, based on a phylogeny derived from morphological characters. However, it has since been shown that the Malagasy boids and &quot;Boa constrictor&quot; do not form a monophyletic group, and the lumping of &quot;Sanzinia&quot;, &quot;Acrantophis&quot; and &quot;Boa&quot; was, therefore, an error. These snakes are therefore correctly represented in their own genera: &quot;Sanzinia&quot; and &quot;Acrantophis&quot;.

To add further to the naming confusion, many species of snake in the family Boidae are known colloquially as &quot;boas&quot;. Also, four subspecies of &quot;B. constrictor&quot; are recognized, each with a distinct common name.

<text>The Polish alphabet (Polish: , ) is the script of the Polish language, the basis for the Polish system of orthography. It is based on the Latin alphabet but includes certain letters (9) with diacritics: the acute accent – : ; the overdot – : ; the tail or &quot;ogonek&quot; – ; and the stroke – . The letters , , and , which are used only in foreign words, are usually absent from the Polish alphabet. Additionally, before the standardization of Polish spelling, was sometimes used in place of , and in place of .

Modified variations of the Polish alphabet are used for writing Silesian and Kashubian, whereas the Sorbian languages use a mixture of Polish and Czech orthography.

==Letters: aspect, name, value==
There are 32 letters in the Polish alphabet: 9 vowels and 23 consonants.

, , and are not used in any native Polish words and are mostly found in foreign words (such as place names) and commercial names. In loanwords they are usually replaced by , , and , respectively (as in &#x27;niqab&#x27;, &#x27;quark&#x27;, &#x27;veranda&#x27;, &#x27;savanna&#x27;, &#x27;extra&#x27;, &#x27;oxymoron&#x27;), although some loanwords retain their original spelling (e.g., , ), and in a few cases both spellings are accepted (such as or , or ). In addition, they can occasionally be found in common abbreviations (e.g., &#x27;priest&#x27; can be abbreviated as either or ). As a result, they are sometimes included in the Polish alphabet (bringing the total number of letters in the alphabet to 35); when included, they take their usual positions from the Latin alphabet ( after ; and either side of ). 

The following table lists the letters of the alphabet, their Polish names (see also Names of letters below), the Polish spelling alphabet name, the Polish phonemes which they usually represent (and rough equivalents for them), other possible pronunciations, and letter frequencies. Diacritics are shown for the sake of clarity. For more information about the sounds, see Polish phonology.
: For English speakers who end the word with a nasal vowel and not a consonant.
: Sequences may be pronounced as geminates .
: is sometimes transcribed phonetically as , though it is phonetically .

 was historically used in native words prior to the 1891 spelling reform by the Academy of Learning, e.g., , (now &#x27;four&#x27;, &#x27;pope&#x27;). Now it is used in some loanwords, e.g., , , .

For digraphs and other rules about spelling and the corresponding pronunciations, see Polish orthography.

== Names of letters ==
The spoken Polish names of the letters are given in the table under Letters above.

The names of the letters are not normally written out in the way shown above, except as part of certain lexicalized abbreviations, such as Pekao (or PeKaO), the name of a bank, which represents the spoken form of the abbreviation P.K.O. (for ).

Some letters may be referred to in alternative ways, often consisting of just the sound of the letter. For example, may be called as it is pronounced: rather than (from &#x27;Greek i&#x27;).

When giving the spelling of words, certain letters may be said in more emphatic ways to distinguish them from other identically pronounced characters. For example, may be referred to as (&#x27;h alone&#x27;) to distinguish it from (). may be called or (&#x27;z with an overdot&#x27;) to distinguish it from (). may be called (&#x27;open u&#x27;, a reference to its graphical form) or (&#x27;normal u&#x27;) to distinguish it from , which is sometimes called (&#x27;closed u&#x27;) or , , (&#x27;dashed ó&#x27;, &#x27;dashed o&#x27;, &#x27;o with a dash&#x27;).

==Alphabetical order==
Polish alphabetical ordering uses the order of letters as in the table under Letters above.

Note that (unlike in languages such as French, Spanish, and German) Polish letters with diacritics are treated as fully independent letters in alphabetical ordering. For example, comes after . The accented letters also have their own sections in dictionaries (words beginning with are not usually listed under ).

Digraphs are not given any special treatment in alphabetical ordering. For example, is treated simply as followed by and not as a single letter as in Czech.

==Computer encoding==
There are several systems for encoding the Polish alphabet for computers. All letters of the Polish alphabet are included in Unicode (blocks Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement and Latin Extended-A), and thus Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 can be used. The Polish alphabet is completely included in the Basic Multilingual Plane of Unicode. The standard 8-bit character encoding for the Polish alphabet is ISO 8859-2 (Latin-2), although both ISO 8859-13 (Latin-7) and ISO 8859-16 (Latin-10) encodings include glyphs of the Polish alphabet. Microsoft&#x27;s format for encoding the Polish alphabet is Windows-1250.

The Polish letters which are not present in the English alphabet have the following HTML codes and Unicode codepoints:

For other encodings, see Polish code pages, but also Combining Diacritical Marks Unicode block.

A common test sentence containing all the Polish diacritic letters is the nonsensical (&#x27;Yellow the ego with/of a gusle&#x27;).

<text>The genus Lumbricus contains some of the most commonly seen earthworms in Europe among its nearly 700 valid species.

Characteristics of some commonly encountered species are:

* &quot;Lumbricus rubellus&quot; is usually reddish brown or reddish violet, iridescent dorsally, and pale yellow ventrally. They are usually about 25–105 mm in length, and have around 95-120 segments.
* &quot;Lumbricus castaneus&quot; varies from chesnut to violet brown; brown or yellow ventrally, and has an orange clitellum. They are usually about 30–70 mm long, and have around 82–100 segments.
* &quot;Lumbricus terrestris&quot; has several common names, including common earthworm, nightcrawler, and dew worm. It is strongly pigmented, brown-red dorsally, and yellowish ventrally. Setae are widely paired at both ends of the body. It is about 90–300 mm long, and has around 110–160 segments.
* &quot;Lumbricus festivus&quot; is not found in large numbers. It is red-brown, lighter ventrally, iridescent dorsally. The body length varies from 48 to 108 mm, with about 100–143 segments.
* &quot;Lumbricus badensis&quot;, the giant earthworm, also belongs to this genus. Its range is restricted to the Black Forest area of southwestern Germany. It is very large and grows up to 600mm.

<text>Membranipora is a genus of bryozoans in the family Membraniporidae. A typical example is the widely distributed species &quot;Membranipora membranacea&quot; that commonly encrusts seaweeds, particularly fronds of the kelps &quot;Laminaria digitata&quot;, &quot;L. hyperborea&quot;, and &quot;Saccorhiza polyschides&quot;.

Colonies of &quot;M. membranacea&quot; show different forms of polyphenism as spines, tower zooids, chimneys and stolons.

== Reproduction ==
The eggs of &quot;M. membranipora&quot; develop into planktonic cyphonautes larvae which is strongly triangular in outline and about 850μm x 600μm big.

<doc id="378956" wikidata="Q690035" url="?curid=378956" title="Kadesh (Syria)">
<text>Kadesh, or Qadesh, was an ancient city of the Levant on or near the headwaters or a ford of the Orontes River. It was of some importance during the Late Bronze Age and is mentioned in the Amarna letters. It was the site of the Battle of Kadesh between the Hittite and Egyptian empires in the 13th century BC.

==Name and location ==
The name is from the West Semitic (Canaanite) root Q-D-Š &quot;holy&quot;. It is rendered &quot;Qdšw&quot; in Egyptian and &quot;Kadeš&quot; in Hittite. Akkadian spelling variants include &quot;Kinza, Kidša, Gizza&quot;.

Kadesh is identified with the ruins at Tell Nebi Mend, about southwest of Homs near al-Qusayr and adjacent to the modern-day Syrian village of Tell al-Nabi Mando. The text of the Kadesh inscriptions locates Kadesh as being near Tunip in the land of the Amurru, itself assumed to have been near the Orontes River (perhaps at Tell Salhab).

Some scholars also identify Kadesh with the city of &quot;Kadytis&quot; (Καδύτις in Greek) mentioned by Herodotus (2.159, an alternative identification for &quot;Kadytis&quot; being Gaza.

==History==
===Early Bronze===
In the late Early Bronze, the site is known for White-on-Blackweel Ware pottery. This ware appeared in the transitional EB III/IV (Phase O), flourished and was traded in the Orontes Valley up to the Plains of Antioch and to eastern North Syria in EB IVA (Phase N). In EB IVB (Phase M), the ware continued features from the previous phase, but is easily distinguishable. It disappeares in the transitional EB IV/MB I (Phase L). Comparison should be made with Hama J7-5 (EB IVA) and J4-2 (EB IVB).

===Middle Bronze Age===

The city first entered historical records when it was mentioned in the archive of Mari in the 18th century BC as the headquarters of king Ishi-Addu of Qatna during the suppression of a rebellion in the south of the city.

In Inner Syria, the Middle Bronze ends with the military campaigns of Mursili I of Hatti (c. 1590 BC). Here the MB IIB is followed by LB IA, while MB IIC starts in the southern Levant.

===Late Bronze Age===
====Mitanni Period====
Kadesh came under Mitanni influence after the murder of Mursili I of Hatti (c. 1587 BCE) and the subsequent decline of the Old Hittite Kingdom. The Mitanni confederation emerged from the Habur region.

Around 1520 BCE, Thutmosis I campaigned north into Syria against the Mitanni, along with Aram, an ally of Kadesh. In the time of Hatshepsut there were no campaigns against Kadesh as she was focused on developing trade across the Red Sea and southward.

Battle of Megiddo. Kadesh is first noted as one of two Canaanite cities (with Megiddo) that led a coalition of city-states opposing the conquest of the Levant by Thutmose III. The king of Kadesh was probably encouraged in this resitance by the ruler of Mittani, Egypt&#x27;s primary foreign rival the Levant. Defeat in the subsequent Battle of Megiddo ultimately led to Egyptian hegemony over the city and the rest of southern Syria.

Although Amenophis II campaigned in the Djadi, from then on for a century and a half, until the reign of Horemheb (1319–1307), Canaan was independent of Egyptian rule.

====Hittite Period====
Around 1350 BC, Suppiluliuma I of Hatti attacked Tushratta of Mitanni conducting military campaigns against Mitanni strongholds, and then taking control over vassal rulers west of the Euphrates River in Syria. Egypt had been allied to Mitanni since peace was made under Amenhotep II, and was now being drawn into the conflict. Both Aziru of Amurru (Akkar Plain) and Etakkama of Kadesh became vassals of Suppiluliuma I. Qatna which had been the regional capital in the Middle Bronze now came to an end facing the Hittites. The ruler pledge for help from the King of Egypt.

Amarna Letters. Correspondence between the ruler of Kadesh and the pharaoh Akhenaten is preserved among the Amarna letters. Kadesh is known as Qidshu in these Akkadian language letters.

The names of three kings of Kadesh survive from contemporary sources: Suttarna (or Sutatarra; fl. c. 1350 BC); Etakkama (c. 1340s) and his son Ari-Teshub (fl. c. 1330–1325).

Under Mursili II of Hatti, several territories in Syria tried to rebel with the support of Horemheb of Egypt. However, the Hittites maintained control. When the 18th Dynasty was replaced by the 19th Dynasty, renewed efforts were made to attack the Hittites in Amurru and Kadesh.

====Seti I campaign====

The city was captured by the great pharaoh Seti I in 1306 BC, during his campaign to Syria. Kadesh had been lost to Egypt since the time of Akhenaten. Tutankhamun and Horemheb had both failed to recapture the city from the Hittites. Seti I was successful here and defeated a Hittite army that tried to defend it. He triumphantly entered the city together with his son Ramesses II and erected a victory stela at the site.

His success was only temporary. As soon as Seti I returned to Egypt, the Hittite king, Mursilis II, marched south to take Kadesh and made it a stronghold of the Hittite defenses in Syria. The Hittites ruled through a viceroy in Carchemish.

====Battle of Kadesh====
The city is best known for one of the best documented battles of the ancient world, the Battle of Kadesh between the superpowers of the 13th century, the Egyptian and Hittite Empires. An Egyptian vassal for approximately 150 years, Kadesh eventually defected to Hittite suzerainty, thereby placing the city on the contested frontier between the two rival empires.

In response to this Hittite expansion southwards, the Egyptian pharaoh Ramesses II prepared an aggressive military response and captured the coastal state of Amurru. The next year, the Hittites moved south to recover Amurru, while the Egyptians moved north to continue their expansion into Syria. The inhabitants of Kadesh had cut a channel from the river to a stream south of the town, which had turned the town into a virtual island.

In 1274 BC, the fifth year of Ramesses&#x27; reign, he led a large force of chariots and infantry to retake the walled city. In the Battle of Kadesh, the two forces clashed on the plain south of the city and west of the Orontes River, in what is widely regarded as the largest chariot versus chariot battle in history (5,000–6,000 between the two sides). The battle saw the Egyptians turning a near catastrophe into a near victory. After Hittite spies convinced the Egyptians that the Hittites were far away, the Hittites ambushed Ramesses in his camp. Ramesses rallied his bodyguard and broke out of the trap in time for the last-minute arrival of a supporting Egyptian force from coastal Amurru. The pharoah was able to recover the initiative, and the two armies withdrew in stalemate, both claiming victory.

====Aftermath====
Kadesh, however, remained under Hittite overlordship, Amurru returned to the Hittite fold, and the Hittite army continued its conquests southward as far as Upi, the territory around Damascus.

The subsequent impasse between Egypt and Hatti was resolved in one of the earliest known international peace treaties, concluded several decades later between Ramesses II and the Hittite king Hattusili III.

===End of Kadesh===
Kadesh vanished from history after it was destroyed by the invading Sea Peoples around 1178 BC. However, Hellenistic remains have been found in the upper levels of the tell mound, and the summit is still occupied today. In Byzantine times, widespread occupation is evidenced by extensive remains at the foot of the tell, which is believed to represent the city of Laodicea ad Libanum. Continuous occupation throughout the Islamic period is likely, the mound having been named after a local Muslim holy man, Nebi Mend. 

==Tell Nebi Mend==
Tell Nebi Mend, consisting of an upper (450 x 200 meter) and lower tell, lies 10 kilometers southwest of the modern city of Homs and covers an area of about 10 hectares and rises to a height of about 30 meters over the plain. An enclosure wall around the site, thought to be Middle Bronze Age, encompasses about 40 hectares. Located at the confluence of the Orontes River and Mukadiya river, it was occupied through the Neolithic (followed by a break in occupation), Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Hellenistic/Roman periods. 

The site was first excavated by a French team led by Maurice Pezard in 1922 and 1923, in the northeast quadrant of the upper mound. The excavator opened two trenches, one 60 meters by 25 meters, and 20 meters deep and the other 30 by 40 meters by 70 meters and shallow. Finds included an incomplete stele of Pharaoh Seti I (c. 1294/1290–1279 BC) in a out-of-context Iron Age level, some stone statuettes and Syro-Hittite cylinder seals, and a terracotta figurine. 

The site was then excavated between 1975 and 1995 by a team from the University College London Institute of Archaeology led by Peter Parr. Nine trenches were opened, all on the upper mound, with excavated levels ranging from Middle Bronze I to Late Bronze II. A number of charcoal samples were radiocarbon dated though there were apparently technical problems that limited their usefulness. Six cuneiform tablets were found at the site, one blank with sealing and the others in a Babylonian dialect of Akkadian. The tablets, from the late 14th century BC, mentioned the name of a ruler, Niqmadda, and provided confirmation of the site as Qadesh.

The site has received damage in the Syrian Civil War.

<doc id="378958" wikidata="Q994747" url="?curid=378958" title="Bee brood">
<text>In beekeeping, bee brood or brood refers to the eggs, larvae and pupae of honeybees. The brood of Western honey bees develops within a bee hive. In man-made, removable frame hives, such as Langstroth hives, each frame which is mainly occupied by brood is called a brood frame. Brood frames usually have some pollen and nectar or honey in the upper corners of the frame. The rest of the brood frame cells may be empty or occupied by brood in various developmental stages. During the brood raising season, the bees may reuse the cells from which brood has emerged for additional brood or convert it to honey or pollen storage. Bees show remarkable flexibility in adapting cells to a use best suited for the hive&#x27;s survival.

==Brood chamber development==
In modern removable frame hives the nursery area is in the &quot;brood chamber&quot;, which beekeepers prefer to be in the bottom box. In the late winter and early spring as the brood cycle begins, the queen starts to lay eggs within the winter cluster in proximity to available honey stores. Honey bees tend to greatly expand the brood chamber as the season progresses. The relative location of the brood chamber within the beehive may also change as bee keepers add more boxes or as wild bees build fresh comb into available cavities. Some beekeepers ensure that the queen will not go into the upper boxes (called &quot;supers&quot; or &quot;honey supers&quot;) by placing a screen called a &quot;queen excluder&quot; between the boxes. The screen has precisely measured open spaces through which a worker bee can pass, but not a queen. Some beekeepers do not use excluders, but try to keep the queen within the intended brood area by keeping a honey barrier of capped honey, which the queen is reluctant to cross, above the brood. In feral hives the honey bees tend to put the brood at bottom center of the cavity, and honey to the sides and above the brood, so beekeepers are trying to follow the natural tendency of the bees.

In the mid to late spring, just before a bee hive would naturally split by swarming, beekeepers often remove frames of brood, with adhering bees, to make up new starter hives, called &quot;nucs&quot; or nucleus colonies. In areas where the climate is mild, one frame may be sufficient to start a new colony, with an added queen. But usually two to three frames are used, together with a frame that is predominantly honey. This ensures that there will be enough adult bees to provide the brood the adequate temperature and sufficient feed if there are a few rainy days when bees cannot gather nectar. If there are not enough adult bees to warm the combs, the brood may die from cold temperature overnight (aptly called &quot;chilled brood&quot;).

==Brood development==
Bee brood frames are composed of brood at various stages of development - eggs, larvae, and pupae. In each cell of honeycomb, the queen lays an egg, gluing it to the bottom of the cell. The queen tends to lay brood in a circular or oval pattern. At the height of the brood laying season, the queen may lay so many eggs per day, that the brood on a particular frame may be virtually of the same age.

As the egg hatches, worker bees add royal jelly - a secretion from glands on the heads of young bees. For three days the young larvae are fed royal jelly, then they are fed nectar or diluted honey and pollen. A few female larvae in special queen cups may be selected to become queens. Their special queen cups are flooded with royal jelly for six days. The extra royal jelly speeds up the queen larvae development. Only the queen will have fully developed ovaries, i.e. she will be sexually mature.
Drone brood develops from unfertilized eggs. Drone brood cells are larger than the cells of female worker bees.

Young larvae eat their way through the royal jelly in a circular pattern until they become crowded, then they stretch out lengthwise in the cell. Soon they begin to spin a cocoon, and their older sisters cap the cell as they go into the pupa stage. These cells collectively are called &quot;capped brood.&quot;

==Rating brood==
Hives that are rated for pollination purposes are generally evaluated in terms of the number of frames of brood.

==As food==

Bee brood is harvested by beekeepers in many countries. In particular, the pupae are the highest in protein when compared to the eggs and larvae, and have protein content equivalent to that of beef or poultry. Brood is rich in carbohydrates, dietary minerals, B vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin D, saturated fat, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

<text>A varsity letter (or monogram) is an award earned in the United States for excellence in school activities. A varsity letter signifies that its recipient was a qualified varsity team member, awarded after a certain standard was met. A person who receives a varsity letter is known as a letterman.

== Description ==

The award letter is usually made in the colors and initials representing the school that the recipient attends. The letter patch is primarily constructed of chenille and felt materials. Standard sizes range from to . While and usually denote Junior Varsity achievements, to would denote full (Senior) Varsity. The stitching style used for creating the chenille look is called a moss stitch, while the outlining sew down is called a chain stitch.

== Origins ==

With the advent of organized sports, there was a need for uniforms. There was an additional need for identifications which was satisfied by the use of emblems or letters.

In 1865, the Harvard baseball team added an Old English &#x27;H&#x27;. The &#x27;H&#x27; was embroidered on the gray flannel shirt. The football team started to use the &#x27;H&#x27; in 1875. For 25 years following the introduction in 1865 of the letter, it was the practice for the team captain to allow certain players who played in the most important games (Yale or Princeton) to keep the &#x27;H&#x27; jerseys as an award. If a player did not play in an important game, the player had to return the jersey at the end of the season. Awarding the &#x27;H&#x27; jersey may have been the birth of the varsity letter as an award. The letterman sweater was first regularly used by the 1891 &quot;Nine&quot; (baseball) and was black with a small Crimson &#x27;H&#x27; on the left breast.

== Usage ==
It is not known when the letter sweater came to high schools. The earliest known example of a letter sweater in a high school is found in the 1911 yearbook of Phoenix Union High School, Arizona Territory. A student in a group photo is pictured, not in a football uniform, wearing a V-neck sweater with the letter &#x27;P&#x27; on the left side.

The sweater seems to be the home of the award letter from the 1890s until the 1930s. Another award during the 1920s and 1930s was a stadium-style blanket given as an award. In the 1930s, the letter award started to appear on leather-sleeved, wool-bodied jackets. The jackets from the 1930s were different in design from today&#x27;s modern jacket.

== Variations and application ==
As a decorative clothing item, the varsity letter has a huge number of variations and no set standard is made to any school on how it should look.

Chenille letters come in many different forms and shapes. Some institutions use Old English or script style, two or three-letter monogram, 3D shading, chenille bordered or the traditional straight block style. Students generally receive only one actual letter but can win the distinction multiple times. These additional designations are shown by adding embroidered sport insignias, modeled metal insert pins, or bars that are attached to the letter. Some schools may embroider non-athletic letters with their award title, such as &quot;Academics&quot; or &quot;Arts&quot;.

The chenille letter is traditionally placed on the left chest of the varsity jacket, which is also at times adorned with championship chenille patches showcasing the team or individual accomplishments. School mascot patches are also commonly used.

During the 1980s, and again in the 2010s, varsity jackets have been adopted into hip-hop fashion, with companies such as Avirex, Phat Farm and Rocawear making their own variations.

<text>Membranipora membranacea is a very widely distributed species of marine bryozoan known from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, usually in temperate zone environments. This bryozoan is a colonial organism characterized by a thin, mat-like encrustation, white to gray in color. It may be known colloquially as the coffin box, sea-mat or lacy crust bryozoan and is often abundantly found encrusting seaweeds, particularly kelps.

==Distribution==
Northeast Atlantic including the Baltic Sea, English Channel, Mediterranean Sea and North Sea. Also native to the North Pacific coastline of North America from Alaska to California. The species was first recorded on the Atlantic coastline of the U.S. in 1987 in the Gulf of Maine. In Canada&#x27;s Atlantic coast, it was first observed in Nova Scotia during the early 1990s, and had reached Newfoundland and Labrador by 2002. It now commonly occurs along the Northwest Atlantic from Long Island Sound to northern Newfoundland, including coastal Quebec, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.

==Morphology and physiology==
&quot;Membranipora membranacea&quot; colonies consist of individual organisms called zooids, each with a chitinous exoskeleton which is secreted by the epidermis. This exoskeleton, hardened with calcium carbonate, is known as the zooecium, which not only serves to protect the internal structures of the organism, but also keeps the individual permanently attached to the substrate and neighboring zooids. Zooids within a colony can communicate via pores in their interconnecting walls, through which coelomic fluid can be exchanged.

The internal, living portion of the zooid is known as the polypide, whose walls are formed by the outer epidermis and inner peritoneum. The lophophore, a ring of ciliated tentacles, protrudes from the polypide to feed. When not feeding, the lophophore retracts into the polypide through the tentacular sheath. The lophophore is controlled by the zooid&#x27;s nervous system, which consists of a ganglion at the lophophore base. This ganglion is responsible for motor and sensory impulses to and from the lophophore, as well as the epithelium and digestive tract. The lophophore retractor is the muscle which controls the movement of the lophophore.

This species does not have the ovicells or avicularium seen in most other members of this phylum.

==Natural history==
===Life cycle===
&quot;Membranipora membranacea&quot; begins its life cycle as a plankton-feeding larva, triangular in shape. After several weeks, the larva attach to a substrate and undergo metamorphosis. The larvae typically settle on their preferred substrates in May, and then the colony undergoes growth, stasis and reproduction, shrinkage, and senescence around September, except in regions where temperature allows them to persist further into the winter. The presence of conspecifics may cause a colony to stop growing and begin stasis and reproduction early. The presence of predators also reduces growth of a colony.

===Reproduction===

Colonies of &quot;M. membranacea&quot; are protandrous sequential hermaphrodites, where colonies transition from male to female reproductive stages, allowing fertilization to occur between colonies or within colonies. Fertilization takes places in the coelomic fluid of female colonies, and the eggs are released through an opening in the lophophore known as the coelomophore. Reproduction or growth of the colony can also take place by budding in a radial pattern from the first established zooid, the ancestrula.

==Ecology==
===Habitat===

&quot;M. membranacea&quot; prefers shallow marine habitats between the mid intertidal to the shallow sublittoral. It may also be found in brackish water. It is typically found attached in colonies to seaweed, shells, or artificial substrates.

===Feeding===

&quot;M. membranacea&quot; can eat food particles such as bacteria, flagellates, diatoms, and other small, planktonic organisms by extracting them from the water with their lophophore. They can also supplement their diet with dissolved organic nutrients through the absorptive epidermis.

===Predation===

Nudibranchs or sea slugs are the primary predators of &quot;M. membranacea&quot;. To defend themselves against these predators, the &quot;M. membranacea&quot; produce chitinous spines which protrude from the corners of the zooid. These spines make it difficult for the nudibranchs to access the polypide of the zooid. However, the energy and resources needed to produce the spines may result in decreased growth and reproduction of the colony.

==Ecological significance==

&quot;M. membranacea&quot; has become an invasive species in many places, and is believed to have a potentially negative impact on marine ecosystems by limiting the ability of seaweeds to reproduce, specifically by interfering with spore release from the kelp blade. The colonies of this bryozoan are also known to interrupt nutrient uptake by seaweed.

&quot;M. membranacea&quot; also decreases density and size of kelp plants within kelp beds by increasing tissue loss and blade breakage. Additionally, &quot;M. membranacea&quot; also affects photosynthetic processes in kelp, since their encrustations may result in reduced concentrations of the primary and accessory pigments in the kelp blade tissue.

<doc id="378970" wikidata="Q2669981" url="?curid=378970" title="Grosch's law">
<text>Grosch&#x27;s law is the following observation of computer performance, made by Herb Grosch in 1953:

I believe that there is a fundamental rule, which I modestly call &quot;Grosch&#x27;s law&quot;, giving added economy only as the square root of the increase in speed — that is, to do a calculation ten times as cheaply you must do it hundred times as fast.

This adage is more commonly stated as

Computer performance increases as the square of the cost. If computer A costs twice as much as computer B, you should expect computer A to be four times as fast as computer B.

Two years before Grosch&#x27;s statement, Seymour Cray was quoted in &quot;Business Week&quot; (August 1963) expressing this very same thought:
Computers should obey a square law — when the price doubles, you should get at least four times as much speed.

The law can also be interpreted as meaning that computers present economies of scale: the more costly is the computer, the price–performance ratio linearly becomes better. This implies that low-cost computers cannot compete in the market.

An analysis of rental cost/performance data for computers between 1951 and 1963 by Kenneth E. Knight found that Grosch&#x27;s law held for commercial and scientific operations (a modern analysis of the same data found that Grosch&#x27;s law only applied to commercial operations). In a separate study, Knight found that Grosch&#x27;s law did not apply to computers between 1963-1967 (also confirmed by the aforementioned modern analysis).

== Debates ==
Paul Strassmann asserted in 1997, that &quot;it was never clear whether Grosch&#x27;s Law was a reflection of how IBM priced its computers or whether it related to actual costs. It provided the rationale that a bigger computer is always better. The IBM sales force used Grosch&#x27;s rationale to persuade organizations to acquire more computing capacity than they needed. Grosch&#x27;s Law also became the justification for offering time-sharing services from big data centers as a substitute for distributed computing.&quot; Grosch himself has stated that the law was more useful in the 1960s and 1970s than it is today. He originally intended the law to be a &quot;means for pricing computing services&quot;.

<doc id="378974" wikidata="Q3646602" url="?curid=378974" title="Gap buffer">
<text>A gap buffer in computer science is a dynamic array that allows efficient insertion and deletion operations clustered near the same location. Gap buffers are especially common in text editors, where most changes to the text occur at or near the current location of the cursor. The text is stored in a large buffer in two contiguous segments, with a gap between them for inserting new text. Moving the cursor involves copying text from one side of the gap to the other (sometimes copying is delayed until the next operation that changes the text). Insertion adds new text at the end of the first segment; deletion deletes it.

Text in a gap buffer is represented as two strings, which take very little extra space and which can be searched and displayed very quickly, compared to more sophisticated data structures such as linked lists. However, operations at different locations in the text and ones that fill the gap (requiring a new gap to be created) may require copying most of the text, which is especially inefficient for large files. The use of gap buffers is based on the assumption that such recopying occurs rarely enough that its cost can be amortized over the more common cheap operations. This makes the gap buffer a simpler alternative to the rope for use in text editors such as Emacs.

==Example==

Below are some examples of operations with buffer gaps. The gap is represented by the empty space between the square brackets. This representation is a bit misleading: in a typical implementation, the endpoints of the gap are tracked using pointers or array indices, and the contents of the gap are ignored; this allows, for example, deletions to be done by adjusting a pointer without changing the text in the buffer.

Initial state:

 This is the way [ ]out.

User inserts some new text:

 This is the way the world started [ ]out.

User moves the cursor before &quot;started&quot;; system moves &quot;started &quot; from the first buffer to the second buffer.

 This is the way the world [ ]started out.

User adds text filling the gap; system creates new gap:

 This is the way the world as we know it [ ]started out.

<doc id="378989" wikidata="Q5276211" url="?curid=378989" title="Digital waveguide synthesis">
<text>Digital waveguide synthesis is the synthesis of audio using a digital waveguide. Digital waveguides are efficient computational models for physical media through which acoustic waves propagate. For this reason, digital waveguides constitute a major part of most modern physical modeling synthesizers.
A lossless digital waveguide realizes the discrete form of d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s solution of the one-dimensional wave equation as the superposition of a right-going and a left-going waves,

: formula_1

where formula_2 is the right-going wave, and formula_3 is the left-going wave. It can be seen from this representation that sampling the function formula_4 at a given position formula_5 and time formula_6 merely involves summing two delayed copies of its traveling waves. These traveling waves will reflect at boundaries such as the suspension points of vibrating strings or the open or closed ends of tubes. Hence the waves travel along closed loops.

Digital waveguide models therefore comprise digital delay lines to represent the geometry of the waveguide which are closed by recursion, digital filters to represent the frequency-dependent losses and mild dispersion in the medium, and often non-linear elements. Losses incurred throughout the medium are generally consolidated so that they can be calculated once at the termination of a delay line, rather than many times throughout.

Waveguides such as acoustic tubes are three-dimensional, but because their lengths are often much greater than their diameters, it is reasonable and computationally efficient to model them as one-dimensional waveguides. Membranes, as used in drums, may be modeled using two-dimensional waveguide meshes, and reverberation in three-dimensional spaces may be modeled using three-dimensional meshes. Vibraphone bars, bells, singing bowls and other sounding solids (also called idiophones) can be modeled by a related method called banded waveguides, where multiple band-limited digital waveguide elements are used to model the strongly dispersive behavior of waves in solids.

The term &quot;digital waveguide synthesis&quot; was coined by Julius O. Smith III, who helped develop it and eventually filed the patent. It represents an extension of the Karplus–Strong algorithm. Stanford University owned the patent rights for digital waveguide synthesis and signed an agreement in 1989 to develop the technology with Yamaha, however, many of the early patents have now expired.

An extension to DWG synthesis of strings made by Smith is commuted synthesis, wherein the excitation to the digital waveguide contains both string excitation and the body response of the instrument. This is possible because the digital waveguide is linear and makes it unnecessary to model the instrument body&#x27;s resonances after synthesizing the string output, greatly reducing the number of computations required for a convincing resynthesis.

Prototype waveguide software implementations were done by students of Smith in the Synthesis Toolkit (STK).

The first musical use of digital waveguide synthesis was in the composition &quot;May All Your Children Be Acrobats&quot; (1981) by David A. Jaffe, followed by his &quot;Silicon Valley Breakdown&quot; (1982).

*Yamaha
** VL1 (1994) — expensive keyboard (about $10,000 USD)
** VL1m, VL7 (1994) — tone module and less expensive keyboard, respectively
** VP1 (prototype) (1994)
** VL70m (1996) — less expensive tone module
** EX5 (1999) — workstation keyboard that included a VL module
** PLG-100VL, PLG-150VL (1999) — plug-in cards for various Yamaha keyboards, tone modules, and the SWG-1000 high-end PC sound card. The MU100R rack-mount tone module included two PLG slots, pre-filled with a PLG-100VL and a PLG-100VH (Vocal Harmonizer).
** YMF-724, 744, 754, and 764 sound chips for inexpensive DS-XG PC sound cards and motherboards (the VL part only worked on Windows 95, 98, 98SE, and ME, and then only when using codice_1 drivers, not codice_2). No longer made, presumably due to conflict with AC-97 and AC-99 sound card standards (which specify &#x27;wavetables&#x27; (sample tables) based on Roland’s XG-competing GS sound system, which Sondius-XG [the means of integrating VL instruments and commands into an XG-compliant MIDI stream along with wavetable XG instruments and commands] cannot integrate with). The MIDI portion of such sound chips, when the VL was enabled, was functionally equivalent to an MU50 Level 1 XG tone module (minus certain digital effects) with greater polyphony (up to 64 simultaneous notes, compared to 32 for Level 1 XG) plus a VL70m (the VL adds an additional note of polyphony, or, rather, a VL solo note backed up by the up-to-64 notes of polyphony of the XG wavetable portion). The 724 only supported stereo out, while the others supported various four and more speaker setups. Yamaha’s own card using these was the WaveForce-128, but a number of licensees made very inexpensive YMF-724 sound cards that retailed for as low as $12 at the peak of the technology’s popularity. The MIDI synth portion (both XG and VL) of the YMF chips was actually just hardware assist to a mostly software synth that resided in the device driver (the XG wavetable samples, for instance, were in system RAM with the driver [and could be replaced or added to easily], not in ROM on the sound card). As such, the MIDI synth, especially with VL in active use, took considerably more CPU power than a truly hardware synth would use, but not as much as a pure software synth. Towards the end of their market period, YMF-724 cards could be had for as little as $12 USD brand new, making them by far the least expensive means of obtaining Sondius-XG CL digital waveguide technology. The DS-XG series also included the YMF-740, but it lacked the Sondius-XG VL waveguide synthesis module, yet was otherwise identical to the YMF-744.
** S-YXG100plus-VL Soft Synthesizer for PCs with any sound card (again, the VL part only worked on Windows 95, 98, 98SE, and ME: it emulated a .VxD MIDI device driver). Likewise equivalent to an MU50 (minus certain digital effects) plus VL70m. The non-VL version, S-YXG50, would work on any Windows OS, but had no physical modeling, and was just the MU50 XG wavetable emulator. This was basically the synth portion of the YMF chips implemented entirely in software without the hardware assist provided by the YMF chips. Required a somewhat more powerful CPU than the YMF chips did. Could also be used in conjunction with a YMF-equipped sound card or motherboard to provide up to 128 notes of XG wavetable polyphony and up to two VL instruments simultaneously on sufficiently powerful CPUs.
** S-YXG100plus-PolyVL SoftSynth for then-powerful PCs (e. g. 333+MHz Pentium III), capable of up to eight VL notes at once (all other Yamaha VL implementations except the original VL1 and VL1m were limited to one, and the VL1/1m could do two), in addition to up to 64 notes of XG wavetable from the MU50-emulating portion of the soft synth. Never sold in the US, but was sold in Japan. Presumably a much more powerful system could be done with today’s multi-GHz dual-core CPUs, but the technology appears to have been abandoned. Hypothetically could also be used with a YMF chipset system to combine their capabilities on sufficiently powerful CPUs.

<text>&#x27; (pl. anni horribiles&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is a Latin phrase that means &quot;horrible year&quot;. It is complementary to , which means &quot;wonderful year&quot;.

==Origin of phrase==
The phrase was used in 1891 in an Anglican publication to describe 1870, the year in which the dogma of papal infallibility was defined in the Catholic Church.

== Elizabeth II ==
===1992===
The expression was brought to prominence by Queen Elizabeth II. In a speech at Guildhall on 24 November 1992, marking her Ruby Jubilee on the throne, she said:
The &quot;sympathetic correspondent&quot; was later revealed to be her former assistant private secretary, Sir Edward Ford. The unpleasant events which happened to the royal family in this year include:
* Publication of photographs pertaining to an affair between Sarah, Duchess of York, and Texan oil millionaire Steve Wyatt (18 January)
* Separation of the Queen&#x27;s second son Prince Andrew, Duke of York, from his wife Sarah (19 March)
* Divorce of the Queen&#x27;s daughter, Anne, Princess Royal, from Captain Mark Phillips (23 April)
* Publication of Diana, Princess of Wales&#x27; tell-all book &quot;&quot;, revealing the problems in her marriage to the Queen&#x27;s eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales particularly his affair with Camilla Parker Bowles (&quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, 7 June)
* Publication of photographs of Sarah, Duchess of York, sunbathing topless with her friend John Bryan (20 August)
* Publication of intimate conversations between Diana and James Gilbey from a tape recording of their phone calls (24 August)
* Fire in Windsor Castle, one of the Queen&#x27;s official residences (20 November)

After her speech had been recorded, one more notable event transpired: the separation of Charles and Diana (9 December).

===2019===
2019 was described by some commentators as a second for the British royal family. In January that year, 97-year-old Prince Philip crashed his car into another carrying two women and a baby, and subsequently surrendered his driving licence. Later on in August, the Queen was involved in a constitutional crisis when Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised her to prorogue Parliament, a recommendation which was later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Prince Andrew gave a universally-criticised BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview about his relationship with convicted child-sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and there was increased tabloid scrutiny regarding rifts between the Cambridge and Sussex households.

==Other uses==
=== Boris Yeltsin ===
&quot;Time&quot; magazine described 1998 in Russian politics as an &quot;annus horribilis&quot; because of Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s isolationist and militarist policies, the East Asian financial crisis, and Western countries cutting off the reform money that they gave to the Russian government in prior years.

=== Ben Affleck ===
Hollywood actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck once described that 2003 was his &quot;annus horribilis&quot;. Affleck starred in &quot;Daredevil&quot; and &quot;Gigli&quot;, both of which received negatively from critics, with the latter being a box-office bomb and drew particular ire from Hollywood critics and moviegoers, which culminated in winning 6 Golden Raspberry Awards. In addition, Affleck and his fiancée and later second wife, Jennifer Lopez, were mocked and criticised by the public for their seemingly accommodating attitudes to and henceforth over-exposure in the tabloid media.

=== Kofi Annan ===
Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General, used the phrase in his year-end press conference on 21 December 2004. He reflected: &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that this has been a particularly difficult year, and I am relieved that this is coming to an end.&quot; His remarks were widely interpreted as having alluded to persistent allegations of corruption in the UN&#x27;s Iraq Oil-for-Food Program. He also spoke of upheaval and violence in Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Palestine, and Sudan; the ongoing process of UN internal reform; and &quot;persistent...criticism against the UN&quot; and himself personally. Annan&#x27;s remarks came five days before the deadliest event of the year (and one of the deadliest natural disasters in history), the Indian Ocean tsunami on 26 December, when 227,898 people died.

=== Juan Carlos I ===
In 2007, the Spanish royal family, in particular King Juan Carlos I, faced a difficult year. Family tragedy and a series of controversies led Spanish newspapers to refer to the year as the king&#x27;s .
* In February, Érika Ortiz Rocasolano, the youngest sister of Letizia, then the Princess of Asturias, died of a sedative overdose in her apartment.
* In July, a humour magazine, , published a drawing that ran on the cover, depicting Felipe VI (then the Prince of Asturias), and the aforementioned Princess Letizia having sex, with a caption reading: &quot;Just imagine if you end up pregnant. This will be the closest thing to work I&#x27;ve ever done in my life.&quot; It satirized a proposal by the government to give 2,500 euros to the parents of newborn children. The magazine was banned and removed from distribution, which led to a censorship controversy.
* In September, Catalan separatists were tried for having burned photographs of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofía at an anti-monarchy and Catalan separatist rally in Girona while the royal couple toured the city.
* In early November at the XVII Ibero-American Summit, after a verbal altercation between Hugo Chávez, President of Venezuela, and José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Prime Minister of Spain, the king asked Chávez, (&quot;Why don&#x27;t you shut up?&quot;).
* Shortly after the summit, the royal house announced the separation of the king&#x27;s daughter, the Duchess of Lugo, and her husband, Jaime de Marichalar. The couple has two children, Felipe and Victoria.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
The year 2020 was widely remarked as being an for the entire world in general, most notably due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019 and rapidly spread worldwide throughout 2020. 2020 was also awarded a &quot;Special Governors&#x27; Award for The Worst Calendar Year EVER!&quot; at the 41st Golden Raspberry Awards. At the end of the year, Netflix released &quot;Death to 2020&quot;, a mockumentary discussing the events of the year.

=== Iran ===
Journalist David Leonhardt of the &quot;New York Times&quot; described 2024 as an &quot;annus horribilis&quot; for the Iranian government, citing the failed outcome of the strikes against Israel in April, the death of president Ebrahim Raisi in May, the death of the core leadership of the Iranian-backed Hamas and Hezbollah during their respective wars against Israel (including the assassination of Hamas&#x27;s Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July), the election of Donald Trump in November, and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December.

<doc id="378994" wikidata="Q804644" url="?curid=378994" title="Lone pair">
<text>In chemistry, a lone pair refers to a pair of valence electrons that are not shared with another atom in a covalent bond and is sometimes called an unshared pair or non-bonding pair. Lone pairs are found in the outermost electron shell of atoms. They can be identified by using a Lewis structure. Electron pairs are therefore considered lone pairs if two electrons are paired but are not used in chemical bonding. Thus, the number of electrons in lone pairs plus the number of electrons in bonds equals the number of valence electrons around an atom.

Lone pair is a concept used in valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) which explains the shapes of molecules. They are also referred to in the chemistry of Lewis acids and bases. However, not all non-bonding pairs of electrons are considered by chemists to be lone pairs. Examples are the transition metals where the non-bonding pairs do not influence molecular geometry and are said to be stereochemically inactive. In molecular orbital theory (fully delocalized canonical orbitals or localized in some form), the concept of a lone pair is less distinct, as the correspondence between an orbital and components of a Lewis structure is often not straightforward. Nevertheless, occupied non-bonding orbitals (or orbitals of mostly nonbonding character) are frequently identified as lone pairs.

A &quot;single&quot; lone pair can be found with atoms in the nitrogen group, such as nitrogen in ammonia. &quot;Two&quot; lone pairs can be found with atoms in the chalcogen group, such as oxygen in water. The halogens can carry &quot;three&quot; lone pairs, such as in hydrogen chloride.

In VSEPR theory the electron pairs on the oxygen atom in water form the vertices of a tetrahedron with the lone pairs on two of the four vertices. The H–O–H bond angle is 104.5°, less than the 109° predicted for a tetrahedral angle, and this can be explained by a repulsive interaction between the lone pairs.

Various computational criteria for the presence of lone pairs have been proposed. While electron density ρ(r) itself generally does not provide useful guidance in this regard, the Laplacian of the electron density is revealing, and one criterion for the location of the lone pair is where &quot;L&quot;(r) &quot;= –&quot;∇2ρ(r) is a local maximum. The minima of the electrostatic potential &quot;V&quot;(r) is another proposed criterion. Yet another considers the electron localization function (ELF).

==Angle changes==

The pairs often exhibit a negative polar character with their high charge density and are located closer to the atomic nucleus on average compared to the bonding pair of electrons. The presence of a lone pair decreases the bond angle between the bonding pair of electrons, due to their high electric charge, which causes great repulsion between the electrons. They are also involved in the formation of a dative bond. For example, the creation of the hydronium (H3O+) ion occurs when acids are dissolved in water and is due to the oxygen atom donating a lone pair to the hydrogen ion.

This can be seen more clearly when looked at it in two more common molecules. For example, in carbon dioxide (CO2), which does not have a lone pair, the oxygen atoms are on opposite sides of the carbon atom (linear molecular geometry), whereas in water (H2O) which has two lone pairs, the angle between the hydrogen atoms is 104.5° (bent molecular geometry). This is caused by the repulsive force of the oxygen atom&#x27;s two lone pairs pushing the hydrogen atoms further apart, until the forces of all electrons on the hydrogen atom are in equilibrium. This is an illustration of the VSEPR theory.

==Dipole moments==
Lone pairs can contribute to a molecule&#x27;s dipole moment. NH3 has a dipole moment of 1.42 D. As the electronegativity of nitrogen (3.04) is greater than that of hydrogen (2.2) the result is that the N-H bonds are polar with a net negative charge on the nitrogen atom and a smaller net positive charge on the hydrogen atoms. There is also a dipole associated with the lone pair and this reinforces the contribution made by the polar covalent N-H bonds to ammonia&#x27;s dipole moment. In contrast to NH3, NF3 has a much lower dipole moment of 0.234 D. Fluorine is more electronegative than nitrogen and the polarity of the N-F bonds is opposite to that of the N-H bonds in ammonia, so that the dipole due to the lone pair opposes the N-F bond dipoles, resulting in a low molecular dipole moment.

==Stereogenic lone pairs==
A lone pair can contribute to the existence of chirality in a molecule, when three other groups attached to an atom all differ. The effect is seen in certain amines, phosphines, sulfonium and oxonium ions, sulfoxides, and even carbanions.

The resolution of enantiomers where the stereogenic center is an amine is usually precluded because the energy barrier for nitrogen inversion at the stereo center is low, which allow the two stereoisomers to rapidly interconvert at room temperature. As a result, such chiral amines cannot be resolved, unless the amine&#x27;s groups are constrained in a cyclic structure (such as in Tröger&#x27;s base).
==Unusual lone pairs==
A stereochemically active lone pair is also expected for divalent lead and tin ions due to their formal electronic configuration of n&quot;s&quot;2. In the solid state this results in the distorted metal coordination observed in the tetragonal litharge structure adopted by both PbO and SnO.
The formation of these heavy metal n&quot;s&quot;2 lone pairs which was previously attributed to intra-atomic hybridization of the metal s and p states has recently been shown to have a strong anion dependence. This dependence on the electronic states of the anion can explain why some divalent lead and tin materials such as PbS and SnTe show no stereochemical evidence of the lone pair and adopt the symmetric rocksalt crystal structure.

In molecular systems the lone pair can also result in a distortion in the coordination of ligands around the metal ion. The lone-pair effect of lead can be observed in supramolecular complexes of lead(II) nitrate, and in 2007 a study linked the lone pair to lead poisoning. Lead ions can replace the native metal ions in several key enzymes, such as zinc cations in the ALAD enzyme, which is also known as porphobilinogen synthase, and is important in the synthesis of heme, a key component of the oxygen-carrying molecule hemoglobin. This inhibition of heme synthesis appears to be the molecular basis of lead poisoning (also called &quot;saturnism&quot; or &quot;plumbism&quot;).

Computational experiments reveal that although the coordination number does not change upon substitution in calcium-binding proteins, the introduction of lead distorts the way the ligands organize themselves to accommodate such an emerging lone pair: consequently, these proteins are perturbed. This lone-pair effect becomes dramatic for zinc-binding proteins, such as the above-mentioned porphobilinogen synthase, as the natural substrate cannot bind anymore – in those cases the protein is inhibited.

In Group 14 elements (the carbon group), lone pairs can manifest themselves by shortening or lengthening single bond (bond order 1) lengths, as well as in the effective order of triple bonds as well. The familiar alkynes have a carbon-carbon triple bond (bond order 3) and a linear geometry of 180° bond angles (figure A in reference ). However, further down in the group (silicon, germanium, and tin), formal triple bonds have an effective bond order 2 with one lone pair (figure B) and trans-bent geometries. In lead, the effective bond order is reduced even further to a single bond, with two lone pairs for each lead atom (figure &quot;C&quot;). In the organogermanium compound (&quot;Scheme 1&quot; in the reference), the effective bond order is also 1, with complexation of the acidic isonitrile (or &quot;isocyanide&quot;) C-N groups, based on interaction with germanium&#x27;s empty 4p orbital.

==Different descriptions for multiple lone pairs==
In elementary chemistry courses, the lone pairs of water are described as &quot;rabbit ears&quot;: two equivalent electron pairs of approximately sp3 hybridization, while the HOH bond angle is 104.5°, slightly smaller than the ideal tetrahedral angle of arccos(–1/3) ≈ 109.47°. The smaller bond angle is rationalized by VSEPR theory by ascribing a larger space requirement for the two identical lone pairs compared to the two bonding pairs. In more advanced courses, an alternative explanation for this phenomenon considers the greater stability of orbitals with excess s character using the theory of isovalent hybridization, in which bonds and lone pairs can be constructed with sp&quot;x&quot; hybrids wherein nonintegral values of &quot;x&quot; are allowed, so long as the total amount of s and p character is conserved (one s and three p orbitals in the case of second-row p-block elements).

To determine the hybridization of oxygen orbitals used to form the bonding pairs and lone pairs of water in this picture, we use the formula 1 + &quot;x&quot; cos θ = 0, which relates bond angle θ with the hybridization index &quot;x&quot;. According to this formula, the O–H bonds are considered to be constructed from O bonding orbitals of ~sp4.0 hybridization (~80% p character, ~20% s character), which leaves behind O lone pairs orbitals of ~sp2.3 hybridization (~70% p character, ~30% s character). These deviations from idealized sp3 hybridization (75% p character, 25% s character) for tetrahedral geometry are consistent with Bent&#x27;s rule: lone pairs localize more electron density closer to the central atom compared to bonding pairs; hence, the use of orbitals with excess s character to form lone pairs (and, consequently, those with excess p character to form bonding pairs) is energetically favorable.

However, theoreticians often prefer an alternative description of water that separates the lone pairs of water according to symmetry with respect to the molecular plane. In this model, there are two energetically and geometrically distinct lone pairs of water possessing different symmetry: one (σ) in-plane and symmetric with respect to the molecular plane and the other (π) perpendicular and anti-symmetric with respect to the molecular plane. The σ-symmetry lone pair (σ(out)) is formed from a hybrid orbital that mixes 2s and 2p character, while the π-symmetry lone pair (p) is of exclusive 2p orbital parentage. The s character rich O σ(out) lone pair orbital (also notated &quot;n&quot;O(σ)) is an ~sp0.7 hybrid (~40% p character, 60% s character), while the p lone pair orbital (also notated &quot;n&quot;O(π)) consists of 100% p character.

Both models are of value and represent the same total electron density, with the orbitals related by a unitary transformation. In this case, we can construct the two equivalent lone pair hybrid orbitals &quot;h&quot; and &quot;h&quot;&#x27; by taking linear combinations &quot;h&quot; = &quot;c&quot;1σ(out) + &quot;c&quot;2p and &quot;h&quot;&#x27; = &quot;c&quot;1σ(out) – &quot;c&quot;2p for an appropriate choice of coefficients &quot;c&quot;1 and &quot;c&quot;2. For chemical and physical properties of water that depend on the &quot;overall&quot; electron distribution of the molecule, the use of &quot;h&quot; and &quot;h&quot;&#x27; is just as valid as the use of σ(out) and p. In some cases, such a view is intuitively useful. For example, the stereoelectronic requirement for the anomeric effect can be rationalized using equivalent lone pairs, since it is the &quot;overall&quot; donation of electron density into the antibonding orbital that matters. An alternative treatment using σ/π separated lone pairs is also valid, but it requires striking a balance between maximizing &quot;n&quot;O(π)-σ* overlap (maximum at 90° dihedral angle) and &quot;n&quot;O(σ)-σ* overlap (maximum at 0° dihedral angle), a compromise that leads to the conclusion that a &quot;gauche&quot; conformation (60° dihedral angle) is most favorable, the same conclusion that the equivalent lone pairs model rationalizes in a much more straightforward manner. Similarly, the hydrogen bonds of water form along the directions of the &quot;rabbit ears&quot; lone pairs, as a reflection of the increased availability of electrons in these regions. This view is supported computationally. However, because only the symmetry-adapted canonical orbitals have physically meaningful energies, phenomena that have to do with the energies of &quot;individual&quot; orbitals, such as photochemical reactivity or photoelectron spectroscopy, are most readily explained using σ and π lone pairs that respect the molecular symmetry.

Because of the popularity of VSEPR theory, the treatment of the water lone pairs as equivalent is prevalent in introductory chemistry courses, and many practicing chemists continue to regard it as a useful model. A similar situation arises when describing the two lone pairs on the carbonyl oxygen atom of a ketone. However, the question of whether it is conceptually useful to derive equivalent orbitals from symmetry-adapted ones, from the standpoint of bonding theory and pedagogy, is still a controversial one, with recent (2014 and 2015) articles opposing and supporting the practice.

<text>Pieter Aertsen (1508, Amsterdam – 2 June 1575, Amsterdam), called &quot;Lange Piet&quot; (&quot;Tall Pete&quot;) because of his height, was a Dutch painter in the style of Northern Mannerism. He is credited with the invention of the monumental genre scene, which combines still life and genre painting and often also includes a biblical scene in the background. He was active in his native city Amsterdam but also worked for a long period in Antwerp, then the centre of artistic life in the Netherlands.

His genre scenes were influential on later Flemish Baroque painting, Dutch still life painting and also in Italy. His peasant scenes preceded by a few years the much better-known paintings produced in Antwerp by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

==Career==

Aertsen was born in Amsterdam, and was apprenticed to Allaert Claesz. He later travelled to the Southern Netherlands and took up residence in Antwerp, first with his compatriot Jan Mandijn. Aertsen became a member of Antwerp&#x27;s Guild of Saint Luke. In the official books of the Guild he is recorded as &quot;Langhe Peter, schilder&quot; (Tall Peter, painter). In 1542 he became a citizen (&quot;poorter&quot;) of Antwerp. Aertsen returned to Amsterdam in 1555–56.

==Subjects and style==
After beginning by painting religious works, in the 1550s he developed the painting of domestic scenes in which he reproduced articles of furniture, cooking utensils, and food with great flair and realism. His &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Shop, with the Flight into Egypt&quot; (Uppsala, 1551) &quot;has been called the earliest example of Mannerist inversion of still life in Northern painting&quot;, showing the &quot;lower&quot; subject matter far more prominently than the subject from history painting. A similar inversion in landscape painting had been developed by Joachim Patinir in Antwerp several decades earlier when he invented the world landscape. Unlike these, in Aertsen&#x27;s works the genre material dominates the front of the image, with the history scene, normally religious, easy to overlook in the background. This pictorial technique drew on the paintings of another Antwerp artist, Jan Sanders van Hemessen, whose genre treatments of religious and moral scenes had smaller scenes inset into the background in a similar way.

In the Uppsala painting the zones behind the butcher&#x27;s stall show (from left) a view through a window of a church, the Holy Family distributing alms on their journey, a worker in the mid-ground, with a merry company eating mussels and oysters (believed to promote lust) in a back room behind. The sign at top right advertises the land behind as for sale. The painting offers the viewer a range of options for life, in an allegory on physical and spiritual food. The painting carries the coat of arms of Antwerp, suggesting it was a civic commission, perhaps by the rich Butcher&#x27;s Guild. Such subjects were mostly painted before about 1560.

In the Renaissance, the classical example of the painter Peiraikos, known only from Pliny the Elder, was important in justifying genre and other &quot;low&quot; subjects in painting. Aertsen was compared to Peiraikos by the Dutch Renaissance humanist Hadrianus Junius (Adriaen de Jonghe, 1511–1575) in his &quot;Batavia&quot;, published posthumously in 1588, which compares Aertsen at each point of Pliny&#x27;s description in a wholly laudatory manner. An article by Zoran Kwak argues that a painting by his son Pieter Pietersz the Elder (1540–1603), normally called &quot;Market Scene with the Journey to Emmaus&quot;, which features prominently a half-naked figure who is clearly a cook (with Jesus and his companions as smaller figures behind him), in fact represents a self-portrait in a partly comic spirit, depicted as Peiraikos.
Later in life, he also painted more conventional treatments of religious subjects, now mostly lost as during the iconoclasm of the beeldenstorm several paintings that had been commissioned for Catholic churches were destroyed. Several of his best works, including altarpieces in various churches in Amsterdam, were also destroyed during the days surrounding the event known as the &quot;Alteratie&quot;, or &quot;Changeover&quot;, when Amsterdam formally reverted to Protestantism from Catholicism on 26 May 1578 at the start of the Eighty Years&#x27; War. One surviving religious work is the &quot;Crucifixion&quot; in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp.

Aersten&#x27;s exact formula of still life and genre figures in the foreground, with small scenes from history painting in the background only persisted for the next generation (or two, as Joachim Wtewael painted some similar works), but history paintings with very prominent and profuse still life elements in the foreground were produced by Rubens and his generation, and in the 17th century both Flemish Baroque painting and Dutch Golden Age painting developed important genres of independent still life subjects, which were just occasionally produced in Aertsen&#x27;s day.
Unlike Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Aertsen&#x27;s genre figures (especially the women) were mostly depicted idealized with considerable dignity and no effort at comedy, using poses that ultimately derived from classical art. In some cases they appear to have been borrowed from the contemporary court portraiture of artists such as Anthonis Mor. Two unusual individual genre portraits (probably not actual individuals) of female cooks in Genoa and Brussels, one full-length and the other in the three-quarter length format devised by Titian for royal portraits, show them holding roasting spits with poultry as if they were Marshall&#x27;s batons.

==Legacy==
Notable pupils who trained in his workshop included Stradanus and Aertsen&#x27;s nephews, Joachim Beuckelaer and Huybrecht Beuckeleer. Joachim Beuckelaer continued and further developed Aertsen&#x27;s style and subject matter of painting.

==Personal life==
He married Kathelijne Beuckelaar, the daughter and sister of an Antwerp painter and aunt of Joachim Beuckelaer and Huybrecht Beuckeleer. Of the couple&#x27;s eight children, three sons, Pieter, Aert, and Dirk became successful painters.

<text>Ottorino Respighi ( , ; ; 9 July 187918 April 1936) was an Italian composer, violinist, teacher, and musicologist and one of the leading Italian composers of the early 20th century. His compositions range over operas, ballets, orchestral suites, choral songs, chamber music, and transcriptions of Italian compositions of the 16th–18th centuries, but his best known and most performed works are his three orchestral tone poems which brought him international fame: &quot;Fountains of Rome&quot; (1916), &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; (1924), and &quot;Roman Festivals&quot; (1928).

Respighi was born in Bologna to a musical and artistic family. He was encouraged by his father to pursue music at a young age, and took formal tuition in the violin and piano. In 1891, he enrolled at the Liceo Musicale di Bologna, where he studied the violin, viola, and composition, was principal violinist at the Russian Imperial Theatre, and studied briefly with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. He relocated to Rome in 1913 to become professor of composition at the Liceo Musicale di Santa Cecilia. During this period he married his pupil, singer Elsa Olivieri-Sangiacomo. In 1923, Respighi quit his professorship to dedicate time to tour and compose, but continued to teach until 1935. He performed and conducted in various capacities across the United States and South America from 1925 until his death.

In late 1935, while composing his opera &quot;Lucrezia&quot;, Respighi became ill and was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis. He died four months later, aged 56. His wife Elsa outlived him for almost 60 years, championing her late husband&#x27;s works and legacy until her death in 1996. Conductor and composer Salvatore Di Vittorio completed several of Respighi&#x27;s incomplete and previously unpublished works, including the finished Violin Concerto in A major (1903) which premiered in 2010.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Respighi was born on 9 July 1879 at 8 Via Guido Reni, an apartment building to the side of Palazzo Fantuzzi. The third and youngest child of Giuseppe and Ersilia (&quot;née&quot; Putti) Respighi, he had a middle class upbringing with his sister Amelia; his brother Alberto died at age nine. Giuseppe, a postal worker, was an accomplished pianist who studied the instrument with Stefano Golinelli and taught music at the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna. Ersilia came from a family of distinguished sculptors. Respighi&#x27;s paternal grandfather was a violinist and organist at the cathedral in modern day Fidenza. Amelia described Respighi as closed in nature but sincere, sensitive, and generous.

Giuseppe encouraged his son, but to his initial disappointment, Respighi showed little interest in music until he was almost eight. After being taught basic piano and violin from his father Respighi began formal tuition in the latter, but quit abruptly after his teacher hit his hand with a ruler for playing a passage incorrectly. He resumed lessons with a more patient teacher. Respighi&#x27;s piano skills were a hit-and-miss affair initially, but his father once arrived home to find Respighi confidently reciting the &quot;Symphonic Studies&quot; by Robert Schumann; he had learned to play the piece in secret. Respighi remained a self-taught pianist and in later life avoided scales in his compositions due to his inability to play them correctly. Nonetheless he quickly took to other instruments; for example, he taught himself the harp in the course of several days.

In 1891, the family relocated to 2 Via de&#x27; Castagnoli where Respighi was able to have his own studio. In his seclusion he collected books and began a lifelong interest in geography, science, and languages. Respighi became fluent, and read literature in, eleven languages in his adult life. His wife recalled the composer&#x27;s meeting with Albert Einstein in Berlin, who was impressed with Respighi&#x27;s understanding of his scientific theories.

=== Life in Bologna, 1890–1913 ===
In October 1890, Respighi began two years of schooling at the Ginnasio Guinizelli. He enrolled at the Liceo Musicale di Bologna in the following year, studying the violin and viola with Federico Sarti and organ, counterpoint, and fugue with Cesare Dall&#x27;Olio. Among Respighi&#x27;s earliest completed and dated compositions at this time were the and for small orchestra. Four years into his course, Respighi began classes in composition and music history, firstly with Liceo director Giuseppe Martucci and then Luigi Torchi. Martucci, a proponent of Bologna&#x27;s musical life and composer of non-operatic Italian music, became an influential figure for the young Respighi. In June 1899, he received his diploma in the playing of the violin, performing &quot;Le Streghe&quot; by Niccolò Paganini in his exam. Not long after Respighi joined the orchestra at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna and played the violin for several seasons.
In the winter of 1900, Respighi accepted the role of principal violist in the orchestra of the Russian Imperial Theatre in Saint Petersburg during its opera season. During this time he met Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, a composer Respighi greatly admired, who gave him valuable and influential lessons in orchestration and composition across five months. Further lessons were arranged when Respighi returned to Russia in the winter of 1902 for another series of performances. Respighi finalised his studies at the with an advanced course in composition, for which he completed his , written under Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s guidance. Performed as part of his final exam in June 1901, the piece was a resounding success. Upon receiving his diploma, Martucci said: &quot;Respighi is not a pupil, Respighi is a master.&quot;

In 1902, Respighi travelled to Berlin where he received brief tuition from composer Max Bruch. Despite sources incorrectly stating that he studied with Bruch in 1908, Respighi&#x27;s wife stated that Respighi in fact did not study with Bruch at all. In 1905, Respighi completed his first opera, the comedy &quot;Re Enzo&quot;. Between 1903 and 1910, as his local reputation was on the rise, Respighi&#x27;s principal activities were performing at the Teatro Comunale and as first violinist in composer Bruno Mugellini&#x27;s touring chamber quintet. He collaborated with various singers, in particular Chiarina Fino-Savio, who performed several of Respighi&#x27;s songs written for solo voice and piano and set to words by poets Ada Negri and Carlo Zangarini. This included perhaps his most well known, &quot;Nebbie&quot;.
In 1906, Respighi completed his first of many transcriptions of pieces by 17th and 18th century composers. His version of &quot;Lamento d&#x27;Arianna&quot; by Claudio Monteverdi for voice and orchestra became his first international success when it was performed during his visit to Berlin in 1908. This second stay in Germany lasted for almost a year, after Hungarian soprano Etelka Gerster hired Respighi as an accompanist at her singing school which greatly influenced his subsequent vocal compositions. Respighi met Arthur Nikisch, then conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, who arranged to conduct his Monteverdi transcription in concert with famed singer Julia Culp as soloist. Biographer Michael Webb considered this a milestone in the rediscovery of Monteverdi&#x27;s output, and the critical success of the performance encouraged Respighi to produce further transcriptions of older works. This included two sonatas for viola d&#x27;amore and harpsichord from original music by fellow Bolognese composer Attilio Ariosti.

The musical influence from Respighi&#x27;s time in Germany is discernible in his second opera &quot;Semirâma&quot;, which marked the first professional staging of a Respighi work. It premiered at the Teatro Comunale in November 1910 to considerable success; two years later, critic Giannotto Bastianelli wrote that the piece marked a transition in Respighi&#x27;s style from verismo to Decadentism, and praised his use of rich polyphony. Working on the opera, however, left Respighi exhausted. He wrote each individual score by hand to save money and he fell asleep at the post-performance banquet. It is thought that Respighi&#x27;s inconsistent sleeping patterns throughout his life may have been caused by narcolepsy.

In 1910, Respighi was involved in a short lived group named the Lega dei Cinque (a take on the famous Russian &quot;Five&quot;), which included Bastianelli and fellow composers Ildebrando Pizzetti, Gian Francesco Malipiero, and Renzo Bossi. In the same year he was appointed a member of the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna. In the next, Respighi replaced Torchi as the teacher of composition at the Liceo Musicale, which lasted until his move to Rome.

=== Life in Rome, 1913–1918 ===

In January 1913, Respighi left Bologna to become professor of composition at the Liceo Musicale di Santa Cecilia in Rome. Among his students during this time were composers Vittorio Rieti, Ennio Porrino, and Daniele Amfitheatrof, conductors Antonio Pedrotti and Mario Rossi, pianist Pietro Scarpini, and organist Fernando Germani. However, the busy and crowded atmosphere of the city unnerved Respighi who found it increasingly difficult to teach and compose. He became withdrawn, homesick, and suffered from irregular sleep.

After a return visit to Germany for several performances in 1913, Respighi focused primarily on teaching. One of his new students in his fugue and composition class was 19-year-old Elsa Olivieri-Sangiacomo; the two started a relationship and Elsa, fourteen years his junior, and Respighi married in January 1919. The pair shared a love for Gregorian chant and Respighi often requested for Elsa to sing monodies to him, sometimes for as long as two hours. From 1921 they lived in a flat in Palazzo Borghese which they named . Elsa recalled composer Giacomo Puccini saying their marriage was &quot;the most beautiful and perfect thing I know.&quot; The Respighis&#x27; mutual friend, librettist Claudio Guastalla, said the marriage &quot;functioned on an almost transcendental level of human and spiritual harmony.&quot;

In February 1915, publisher Tito Ricordi took an interest in Respighi, who agreed to publish a collection of transcriptions for violin and piano from 1908, namely pieces by Nicola Porpora, Giuseppe Tartini, and Francesco Maria Veracini. In the same year he had a minor involvement in the Società Italiana di Musica Moderna, a group founded in 1915 by Alfredo Casella and other staff members of the in an effort to modernise Italian music as a result of Casella&#x27;s visit to France.

Following Italy&#x27;s entry into World War I in 1915 the 36-year-old Respighi was eligible for military service, but his position at the granted him temporary exemption. Respighi soon entered a low period, for he was deeply saddened by the death of his mother from pneumonia in March 1916. Upon receiving the news of her illness his departure for Bologna was delayed; she died by the time he had arrived. Respighi returned to Rome and resumed work for a brief period until he stopped and went back to Bologna. According to Elsa he spent much of his days in bed, ate little, and refused to see anyone. He recovered in Eremo di Tizzano, a religious retreat in the country hills by Casalecchio di Reno. His short piece for organ, the , was composed there. In a letter from January 1917 to Fino-Savio, Respighi wrote: &quot;I am alone, sad and sick.&quot;

In March 1917 his first orchestral tone poem, &quot;Fountains of Rome&quot;, premiered at the Teatro Augusteo in Rome. The premiere was originally scheduled in late 1916, but the concert ended early due to the hostile audience reaction to music by Richard Wagner performed in the opening half. Respighi was disappointed with the lukewarm response at the Augusteo, which fuelled his desire to write a more successful follow-up. Following the premiere he toured Italy and Switzerland in another chamber group, this time with Fino-Savio, violinist Arrigo Serato, and pianist Ernesto Consolo. In December 1917 the first of Respighi&#x27;s three orchestral suites, &quot;Ancient Airs and Dances&quot;, also premiered in Rome. Each suite features free transcriptions of pieces for lute pieces by various 16th century Italian composers. The sole copy of the full score was somehow lost after the concert, and Respighi was forced to re-write it using the individual parts.

In the summer of 1916 Respighi travelled to Viareggio to meet Russian impresario Sergei Diaghilev, operator of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev wished to stage &quot;La Boutique fantasque&quot;, a new production based on the baroque and classical periods, to which Respighi accepted 1,500 lire to orchestrate the ballet, for which he used piano pieces from &quot;Péchés de vieillesse&quot; by Gioachino Rossini.

=== Rise to fame, 1918–1925 ===
A turning point in Respighi&#x27;s career arrived in February 1918, when conductor Arturo Toscanini had asked him to select a composition to be performed in a series of 12 concerts in Milan. He reluctantly picked &quot;Fountains of Rome&quot;, which had thus far only been performed at its 1917 premiere. The concerts were a huge success and placed Respighi as one of the leading Italian composers of the early 20th century, prompting the start of a longterm, though sometimes tumultuous, relationship with Toscanini. Several months later Respighi secured a deal with Casa Ricordi to publish the work that granted him 40% of the rental and performance rights. Later in 1918 he succumbed to illness with a mild case of the Spanish flu, and entered negotiations to translate and publish &quot;Theory of Harmony&quot; (1922) by Arnold Schoenberg and a book on counterpoint by Sergei Taneyev, but these never materialised.

In the summer of 1919, Respighi accepted a second commission from Diaghilev for the Ballets Russes: a revised version of &quot;Le astuzie femminili&quot; by Domenico Cimarosa that concludes with a series of dances based on Russian musical themes, to which Respighi provided new arrangements of the score. The ballet premiered in Paris in 1920. Respighi agreed to produce a score for a revival of &quot;La serva padrona&quot; by Giovanni Paisiello, which was to also have a Russian connection. He delivered the manuscript in March 1920, one month late. However, Diaghilev had decided against a full stage production and used Respighi&#x27;s music as part of a series of different songs and dance numbers. The score was considered lost until it was rediscovered 90 years later and performed in its entirety in Bologna in 2014. In 1922, Respighi composed the opera &quot;La bella dormente nel bosco&quot; for Vittorio Podrecca&#x27;s puppet company, itself based on the fairy tale &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;.
In January 1921, Respighi and Elsa embarked on their first concert tour as joint performers with violinist Mario Corti. It was Elsa&#x27;s debut as a live performing artist. The tour saw dates across Italy, followed by Prague, Brno, and Vienna. Respighi&#x27;s employers at the Liceo Musicale were not happy with his extended absence, and sent him a letter suggesting he returned to fulfil his teaching duties for the remainder of the academic year. By 1921, Respighi had begun a lifelong friendship with the writer and journalist Claudio Guastalla, who suggested he compose a new opera and offered to write the libretto. This sparked a period of creativity and Respighi finished &quot;Belfagor&quot;, his first opera in a decade, without the spells of depression that usually fell upon him after a piece was finished. It premiered in Milan in April 1923. Guastalla produced the libretti for all four subsequent operas from Respighi and influenced the conception, or programmes for, some of his non-operatic compositions.

In January 1922, despite the possibility of further objections from the Liceo Musicale, the Respighis went on a second concert tour, this time in Czechoslovakia. Respighi steered a neutral course towards Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist government from 1922, and his growing international fame granted him some amount of freedom, but at the same time encouraged the regime to exploit his music for political purposes. Respighi vouched for more outspoken critics such as Toscanini to continue to work under the regime. In 1923, Respighi became the first director of the now state-funded in Rome. He disliked the time-consuming administrative duties the position required and resigned in 1926, but continued to teach an advanced course in composition at the conservatory until 1935.

Six years after &quot;Fountains of Rome&quot;, Respighi completed the follow-up orchestral tone poem &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; which premiered at the Augusteo in December 1924. It became one of his most well known and widely performed works. In 1925, Respighi and Sebastiano Luciani published an elementary textbook on the history of music and theory entitled &quot;Orpheus&quot;.

=== International recognition, 1925–1936 ===
By the mid-1920s, Respighi&#x27;s growing worldwide fame encouraged the composer to travel extensively, conducting his own pieces, or performing as soloist for his piano compositions. He made his first visit to America in December 1925 to perform and conduct a series of concerts; his first took place at Carnegie Hall on 31 December as soloist for the premiere of his piano and orchestral work, &quot;Concerto in modo misolidio&quot;. In March 1926, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam dedicated a series of concerts to Respighi and in 1931, a Respighi festival was held in Belgium.

In May 1927, Respighi and Elsa travelled to Brazil to engage in a concert series of his own music in Rio de Janeiro. The musical style and local customs inspired Respighi, who told the press of his intention to return in the following year with a five-part orchestral suite based on his visit. He did return to Rio in June 1928, but the final piece took form in an orchestral work in three movements entitled . In September 1927, Respighi conducted the premiere of his , a three-movement orchestral piece inspired by three paintings by Sandro Botticelli in Vienna. He dedicated it to American pianist Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, the patron of the work.
In November 1928, Respighi returned to America for the premiere of his piano and orchestral work at Carnegie Hall, with Willem Mengelberg conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra with the composer on piano. By the year&#x27;s end Respighi completed his third Roman tone poem, &quot;Roman Festivals&quot;, composed in just nine days. It premiered on 21 February 1929 at Carnegie Hall in New York City with Arturo Toscanini conducting the New York Philharmonic. The Italian premiere followed on 17 March. Having completed the work, Respighi felt that he had incorporated the &quot;maximum of orchestral sonority and colour&quot; from the orchestra and could no longer write such large scale pieces. It was at this time he started to favour compositions for smaller ensembles.

At the end of 1929, Respighi had conductor Serge Koussevitzky forward a proposal to Sergei Rachmaninoff which involved permission to orchestrate a selection of piano pieces from his two &quot;Études-Tableaux&quot;, Op. 33 and Op. 39. An enthusiastic Rachmaninoff accepted the offer and supplied Respighi with the program descriptions behind five pieces which were previously kept secret. Koussevitzky conducted the premiere of Respighi&#x27;s with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in November 1931, and noted that Respighi&#x27;s arrangements were &quot;very good&quot; and demanding of the orchestra which required eight rehearsals. Rachmaninoff thanked Respighi for his work and being faithful to the original scores. Later in 1930, Respighi wrote a commission piece to honour the fiftieth anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The result was &quot;Metamorphoseon, Modi XII&quot;, an orchestral work containing a theme and twelve variations.

In 1932, the Fascist government honoured Respighi with membership of the Reale Accademia d&#x27;Italia, one of the highest honours awarded to the most eminent people in Italian science and culture. In the same year Respighi was a signatory in an anti-modernist group that involved several composers, including Pizzetti, Alceo Toni, and Giuseppe Mulè.

From 1933 until his death, Respighi completed no new compositions. Among his final works was &quot;Huntingtower: Ballad for Band&quot; in 1932, a commission from Edwin Franko Goldman and the American Bandmasters Association in honor of the recent death of composer and conductor John Philip Sousa. Respighi wrote it in six weeks, and based it on a recent visit to Huntingtower Castle in Scotland. It was his only piece scored for a band. Also in 1932, Respighi completed his second concert tour of the US.

Respighi&#x27;s opera &quot;La fiamma&quot; premiered at the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma in January 1934, with the composer as conductor. In June 1934, Respighi and Elsa made the month-long voyage to Argentina where Respighi conducted the same opera. This was followed by a visit to Uruguay, where several orchestral concerts were arranged for radio broadcast. Respighi&#x27;s final completed work was a transcription of , a cantata by Benedetto Marcello.

===Illness and death===
By May 1935, Respighi had cancelled several engagements due to ill health, including a scheduled trip to conduct a series of concerts at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. By November, he had completed a piano draft and the majority of the orchestral arrangements of his next opera, &quot;Lucrezia&quot;. He had planned to work on a transcription of an opera by Francesco Cavalli that was to be staged alongside &quot;Lucrezia&quot; during the 1936–37 season at the La Scala in Milan, but declining health caused him to stop work. Neither work was completed in Respighi&#x27;s lifetime; Elsa finished &quot;Lucrezia&quot; after Respighi&#x27;s death with Respighi&#x27;s former pupil Ennio Porrino, in 1937.
While working on his opera &quot;Lucrezia&quot; at the end of 1935, Respighi became ill with a fever and fatigue. Subsequent medical checks in January 1936 revealed samples of &quot;S. viridans&quot; bacteria in his blood, leading to the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, a heart infection still untreatable at the time and probably brought on by his recent throat infection and oral surgery. Respighi&#x27;s health deteriorated over the next four months, during which he received three blood transfusions and experimental treatment with sulphonamides imported from Germany. Elsa made a conscious effort to hide the severity of the illness from others, except for a select few. Respighi died on 18 April in Rome, aged 56, from complications of blood poisoning. Elsa and several friends were by his side. A funeral was held two days later. His body lay in state at Santa Maria del Popolo until the spring of 1937, when the remains were re-interred at the Certosa di Bologna, next to poet Giosuè Carducci and painter Giorgio Morandi. Inscribed on his tomb are his name and crosses; the dates of his birth and death are not given.

==Legacy==
Elsa survived her husband for nearly 60 years, unfailingly championing his works and legacy. Several months after Respighi&#x27;s death, she wrote to Guastalla: &quot;I live because I can truly still do something for him. And I shall do it, that is certain, until the day I die.&quot; However, Italian governments following Mussolini distanced themselves from nationalistic composers including Respighi, Malipiero, Pizzetti, and Pietro Mascagni, and several Italian newspapers protested against honours bestowed upon Elsa. Nevertheless, in 1961 she donated a collection of unpublished and incomplete manuscripts to the Liceo Musicale and in 1969, helped establish the Fondo Ottorino Respighi foundation at the Fondazione Cini in Venice which included the donation of a large number of letters and photographs. A collection of manuscripts of early works, personal items, and the composer&#x27;s death mask were also donated to the International Museum and Library of Bologna. Elsa was at the forefront of the Respighi centenary celebrations in 1979 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Respighi&#x27;s birth, though it was opposed by what she described as &quot;musical progressives with left-wing political sympathies&quot; who tried to discredit his legacy. The commemoration saw a number of long-neglected works of Respighi&#x27;s performed and recorded for the first time. Elsa died in 1996, one week short of her 102nd birthday.

In 1993, Swiss conductor Adriano Baumann founded the Respighi Society in London in an effort to make Respighi&#x27;s &quot;life and works [...] better known and understood by the dissemination of accurate and impartial information.&quot; It has since been dissolved. On 4 March 2000, a commemorative plaque was unveiled at Respighi&#x27;s birthplace on Via Guido Reni in Bologna. His niece Luisa Putti and great-nieces Elsa and Gloria Pizzoli were in attendance; the latter had donated the piano Respighi used to compose &quot;Fountains of Rome&quot; and &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; to the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna in 1956.

In 2006, Elsa and Gloria approached Italian conductor and composer Salvatore Di Vittorio who, along with Respighi archiver and cataloguer Potito Pedarra, commissioned him to complete several of Respighi&#x27;s incomplete and previously unpublished compositions. This included the Violin Concerto in A major from 1903, which premiered in 2010 with Di Vittorio conducting his Chamber Orchestra of New York. The orchestra continues to premiere ongoing new editions by Di Vittorio of Respighi&#x27;s music in premieres as well as recordings on Naxos Records. In 2008, Di Vittorio premiered his &quot;Overture Respighiana&quot;, an orchestral work written as a homage to Respighi.

<text>William Etty (10 March 1787 – 13 November 1849) was an English artist best known for his history paintings containing nude figures. He was the first significant British painter of nudes and still lifes. Born in York, he left school at the age of 12 to become an apprentice printer in Hull. He completed his apprenticeship seven years later and moved to London, where in 1807 he joined the Royal Academy Schools. There he studied under Thomas Lawrence and trained by copying works by other artists. Etty earned respect at the Royal Academy of Arts for his ability to paint realistic flesh tones, but had little commercial or critical success in his first few years in London.

Etty&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Arrival in Cilicia&quot;, painted in 1821, featured numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All but one of the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although he was one of the most respected artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes. He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press.

An extremely shy man, Etty rarely socialised and never married. From 1824 until his death he lived with his niece Betsy (Elizabeth Etty). Even in London he retained a keen interest in his native York, and was instrumental in the establishment of the town&#x27;s first art school and the campaign to preserve York city walls. While he never formally converted from his Methodist faith, he was deeply attached to the Roman Catholic Church and was one of the few non-Catholics to attend the 1838 opening of Augustus Pugin&#x27;s chapel for St Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott, at that time England&#x27;s most important Roman Catholic building.

Etty was prolific and commercially successful throughout the 1840s, but the quality of his work deteriorated throughout this period. As his health progressively worsened he retired to York in 1848. He died in 1849, shortly after a major retrospective exhibition. In the immediate aftermath of his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums. Changing tastes meant his work later fell out of fashion, and imitators soon abandoned his style. By the end of the 19th century the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices, and outside his native York he remained little known throughout the 20th century. Etty&#x27;s inclusion in Tate Britain&#x27;s landmark &quot;Exposed: The Victorian Nude&quot; exhibition in 2001–02, the high-profile restoration of his &quot;The Sirens and Ulysses&quot; in 2010 and a major retrospective of his work at the York Art Gallery in 2011–12 led to renewed interest in his work.

==Background==

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, British painting was strongly influenced by Joshua Reynolds (1723–1792), the first president of the Royal Academy of Arts (RA). Reynolds believed the purpose of art was &quot;to conceive and represent their subjects in a poetical manner, not confined to mere matter of fact&quot;, and that artists should emulate Renaissance painters such as Rubens, Paolo Veronese and Raphael and make their subjects close to perfection. After Reynolds&#x27;s death his &quot;Discourses on Art&quot;, which extolled the notion of an artist&#x27;s duty to paint idealised subjects, remained Britain&#x27;s primary theoretical work on art. The Royal Academy dominated British art, with the annual Royal Academy Summer Exhibition the most important event in the calendar. The Royal Academy also controlled the prestigious Royal Academy art schools, which had an effective monopoly on the training of new artists and which taught with a very narrow focus on approved techniques. While painters such as J. M. W. Turner (a strong supporter of the Royal Academy) were beginning to move away from the influence of the Old Masters to create uniquely British styles, they adhered to principles established by Reynolds.

In the opinions then current at the Royal Academy and among critics, the most prestigious form of painting was considered history painting, in which an artwork illustrated a story. It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time, as well as to the Old Masters. Other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles, as they did not give the artist as much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality. Nonetheless, even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting, as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects or their families, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy (Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence) had made their names as portrait painters. Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings, by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline.

==Childhood and apprenticeship (1787–1805)==

William Etty was born in Feasegate, York, on 10 March 1787, the seventh child of Matthew and Esther Etty, née Calverley. Although Matthew Etty was a successful miller and baker, he bore a large family and was never financially secure. Esther Calverley&#x27;s brother unexpectedly inherited the title of Squire of Hayton in 1745, nine years before Esther&#x27;s birth, but disowned her following her marriage to Matthew, whom he considered as beneath her station. The family were strict Methodists and William was raised as such, although he disliked the spartan appearance of the Methodist chapel and liked to attend his Anglican parish church or York Minster when able.

He showed artistic promise from an early age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father&#x27;s shop. From the age of four he attended local schools in York, before being sent at the age of 10 to Mr. Hall&#x27;s Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8 October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the &quot;Hull Packet&quot;. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise for the first time that it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.

On 23 October 1805, Etty&#x27;s seven-year indenture with Peck expired, an event greeted with great happiness as he intensely disliked the job. He remained in Hull for a further three weeks as a journeyman printer. He moved to London &quot;with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours&quot;, to stay with his older brother Walter in Lombard Street. Walter worked for the successful gold lace manufacturer Bodley, Etty and Bodley, with whom their father&#x27;s brother, also named William, was partner. He arrived in London on 23 November 1805, with the intention of gaining admission to the Royal Academy Schools.

==Training (1806–1821)==

Applicants to the Royal Academy Schools were expected to pass stringent ability tests, and on his arrival in London Etty set about practising, drawing &quot;from prints and from nature&quot;. Aware that all successful applicants were expected to produce high quality drawings of classical sculptures, he spent much time &quot;in a plaster-cast shop, kept by Gianelli, in that lane near to Smithfield, immortalised by Dr. Johnson&#x27;s visit to see &#x27;The Ghost&#x27; there&quot;, which he described as &quot;My &quot;first&quot; academy&quot;.

Etty obtained a letter of introduction from Member of Parliament Richard Sharp to painter John Opie. He visited Opie with this letter, and showed him a drawing he had done from a cast of &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot;. Impressed, Opie recommended Etty to Henry Fuseli, who accepted him into the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer. Having satisfactorily completed drawings from casts of &quot;Laocoön&quot; and &quot;the Torso of Michelangelo&quot;, Etty was accepted as a full student on 15 January 1807.
Shortly after Etty joined the RA, four major lectures on painting were delivered by John Opie in February and March 1807. In them, Opie said that painting &quot;brings into view the heroes, sages, and beauties of the earliest periods, the inhabitants of the most distant regions, and fixes and perpetuates the forms of the present day; it presents to us the heroic deeds, the remarkable events, and the interesting examples of piety, patriotism and humanity of all ages; and according to the nature of the action depicted, fills us with innocent pleasure, excites our abhorrence of crimes, moves us to piety, or inspires us with elevated sentiments&quot;. Opie rejected Reynolds&#x27;s tradition of idealising the subjects of paintings, observing that he did not believe &quot;that the flesh of heroes is less like flesh than that of other men&quot;. Opie advised his students to pay great attention to Titian, whose use of colour he considered unsurpassed, advising students that &quot;colouring is the sunshine of the art, that clothes poverty in smiles [...] and doubles the charms of beauty. Opie&#x27;s opinions made a deep impression on the young Etty, and he would hold these views throughout his career.

===Thomas Lawrence===

By this time, Etty had developed a great admiration for the portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, and hoped to learn from him. Having arranged an introduction via Henry Fuseli, Etty&#x27;s uncle William met with Lawrence and paid him 100 guineas (about £ in 2025 terms) in return for his accepting the younger William as a private pupil for a year.

Under this arrangement Etty did not receive formal tuition from Lawrence. Instead, Lawrence set aside a room in his attic for Etty to copy from his pictures, and agreed to answer questions when he was in a position to do so. Etty found the experience of copying Lawrence&#x27;s work extremely frustrating, and in his own words &quot;was ready to run away&quot;, but he persisted and eventually taught himself to copy Lawrence&#x27;s work very closely. Although Etty found his year with Lawrence a frustrating experience, his development of the ability to copy other works served him in good stead in future when he came to copy elements from the Old Masters.

Once he had completed his year with Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings, as well as undertaking commissions and doing occasional work for Lawrence to earn money. He was unsuccessful in all the Academy&#x27;s competitions, and every painting he submitted for the Summer Exhibition was rejected.

In 1809 Etty&#x27;s uncle William, with whom he had been staying, died. He was forced into an inconvenient transient lifestyle, moving from lodging to lodging. Etty had been left a significant sum in his uncle&#x27;s will, and his brother Walter now took over their uncle&#x27;s position at Bodley, Etty and Bodley, giving Walter the means to support the younger William&#x27;s work financially. In 1811 Etty&#x27;s persistence paid off. Two of his paintings were accepted for the &quot;Telemachus Rescues Antiope from the Fury of the Wild Boar&quot; exhibition at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and &quot;Sappho&quot; at the British Institution. The latter sold for the respectable sum of 25 guineas (about £ in 2025 terms). Although from now on Etty had at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years. By 1814, Etty was becoming widely respected at the RA for his use of colour and in particular his ability to produce realistic flesh tones.

===France and Italy===

At the time, there were no public art galleries in England with permanent collections. In 1816, in the face of his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.

Etty landed in Dieppe, and made his way to Paris via Rouen. Although he admitted to finding France a beautiful country, he was unhappy throughout his stay there, suffering from severe homesickness; shortly after his arrival in Paris he wrote to his cousin Martha Bodley that &quot;I hope I shall like Italy better than Paris, or I think I shall not feel resolution to stop a year. If I don&#x27;t, I shall content myself with seeing what I think worth while; and then return.&quot; He travelled onwards via Geneva, but found Switzerland frustrating; although he had brought his own tea-making equipment with him, in the remoter mountain villages he found it difficult to obtain milk for his tea. Travelling through the Simplon Pass to Piedmont revived his spirits somewhat; he found the variety of colour in the landscapes of northern Italy fascinating, and in late September arrived in Florence.
Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that &quot;I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy&quot; and complaining of &quot;the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth&quot; which he considered &quot;such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it&quot;. His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.

Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (&quot;Bacchanalians: a Sketch&quot; and &quot;Cupid and Euphrosyne&quot;) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; who considered &quot;Bacchanalians&quot; &quot;a fine classical invention&quot; and &quot;Cupid&quot; as showing &quot;splendid promise&quot;. Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty&#x27;s potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza&#x27;s &quot;The Rape of Ganymede&quot;—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy&#x27;s painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his work further raised his prestige within the Academy. Although his income was still low and he was surviving on gifts from his brother, at some point by 1818 Etty hired an assistant, George Henry Franklin.

====&quot;The Coral Finder&quot;====

At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty exhibited two paintings: &quot;Drunken Barnaby&quot; and &quot;The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos&quot;. &quot;Drunken Barnaby&quot; is a scene of a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built, plump and rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty continued to paint women throughout his career. &quot;The Coral Finder&quot; is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty&#x27;s first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references for which he was to become famous.

&quot;The Coral Finder&quot; was sold at exhibition to piano manufacturer Thomas Tomkinson for £30 (about £ in 2025 terms). Sir Francis Freeling had admired &quot;The Coral Finder&quot; at its exhibition, and on learning that it had already been sold he commissioned Etty to paint a similar picture on a more ambitious scale, for a fee of 200 guineas (about £ in 2025 terms). Etty had for some time been musing on the possibility of a painting of Cleopatra, and took the opportunity provided by Freeling to paint a picture of her based loosely on the composition of &quot;The Coral Finder&quot;.

==Recognition and travels (1821–1823)==

&quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Arrival in Cilicia&quot; (also known as &quot;The Triumph of Cleopatra&quot;) is based loosely on Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Antony&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, in which the Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to &quot;The Coral Finder&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; is more closely related to the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are out of proportion to each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.

When exhibited in 1821, &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was generally extremely well received, and considered among the finest paintings of its kind, and its success inspired Etty to paint more works in a similar vein. The exhibition of &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, coupled with the exhibition in January 1822 of &quot;A Sketch from One of Gray&#x27;s Odes (Youth on the Prow)&quot; which also depicted nude figures on a boat, drew criticism of Etty for his treatment of female nudes. &quot;The Times&quot; in early 1822 chided Etty, remarking that &quot;We take this opportunity of advising Mr. Etty, who got some reputation for painting &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Galley&quot;, not to be seduced into a style which can gratify only the most vicious taste. Naked figures, when painted with the purity of Raphael, may be endured: but nakedness without purity is offensive and indecent, and on Mr. Etty&#x27;s is mere dirty flesh.&quot; Unlike nude studies by other artists of the period, Etty made no attempt to idealise the female nudes in &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, but instead painted them in realistic poses and realistic flesh tones. Possibly alarmed by the criticism, Freeling persuaded Etty to paint clothes onto some of the figures in &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, although in 1829 he allowed Etty to return the figures to the state in which he had originally painted them.
The success of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; notwithstanding, Etty remained a student at the RA and continued with a rigorous programme of study. Now in his mid 30s, he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired, despite his unpleasant experiences the last time he left England.

===Travels in Europe===
Recalling his homesickness and loneliness the last time he had ventured abroad, for his next foreign trip Etty travelled in the company of Richard Evans, who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence. Despite warnings that Italy would be uncomfortably hot, the two men set out on 23 June 1822 with the aim of reaching Rome. Crossing to France by means of the recently developed steamboat, they arrived in Paris on 26 June. They stayed in Paris for two weeks, visiting Versailles and the city&#x27;s public art galleries; they also visited the much-reduced remaining exhibits of the Louvre. The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time, at which Etty felt a great dislike for the quality of portraiture in France, but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections, in particular Rubens&#x27;s Marie de&#x27; Medici cycle, elements of which he later reused in many of his own works.

Travelling onwards through Dijon and Switzerland, Etty and Evans passed over the Simplon Pass and on to Milan, where they viewed Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and visited the Brera Gallery. After a sixteen-day cabriolet ride through the gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer, the two men reached Florence, where they stayed for two days visiting the city&#x27;s galleries. On 10 August, the two men reached Rome.

Although Etty was somewhat disappointed by Rome, comparing the architecture of St. Peter&#x27;s unfavourably with that of St. Paul&#x27;s, he was highly impressed with Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;almost Venetian&quot; use of colour in the Sistine Chapel. He also met Antonio Canova, to whom he had been recommended by Lawrence, shortly before Canova&#x27;s death. Rome was at the time suffering badly from malaria, and after two weeks Etty decided to leave for Naples. Evans had contracted malaria and decided to stay in Rome, and so Etty travelled to Naples alone and returned to Rome in the company of actor William Macready, who happened to be making the same journey, and with whom he remained a good friend for the rest of his life. On his return to Rome, Etty toured the city&#x27;s museums, making copies of various artworks, particularly those of the Venetian artists such as Titian and Veronese whom he so admired.

====Venice====

Feeling unsettled, Etty left Rome for Venice, intending to remain there for 10 days and then return to England. Evans preferred to remain in Rome, so Etty travelled alone, pausing briefly in Florence and in Ferrara (where he stopped to kiss the armchair of Ludovico Ariosto). The painter Charles Lock Eastlake, then resident in Rome, had provided Etty with a letter of introduction to Harry D&#x27;Orville, British vice consul in Venice; D&#x27;Orville was so impressed with Etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house, rather than in lodgings. Etty had long considered Venice his spiritual home and &quot;the hope and idol of my professional life&quot;, and had often wondered why, given its artistic importance, so few English travellers visited the city. He was not disappointed. Throughout the remainder of his life, he looked back on his visit to Venice with great fondness, writing shortly before his death that &quot;Venezia, cara Venezia! thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now!&quot;

Although Etty had only intended to stay for 10 days, he was so taken with Venice that he remained for over seven months. He fell into a routine of copying paintings in Venetian collections by day, and attending the life class of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts by night, producing around 50 oil paintings in total as well as numerous pencil sketches. He was extremely impressed with the high quality of the Venetian Academy; the instructors in their turn were extremely impressed with the quality of Etty&#x27;s work, in particular his flesh tones. He acquired the nickname of &quot;Il Diavolo&quot; owing to the high speed at which he was able to paint, and watching him at work became something of a spectacle in its own right; Gioachino Rossini, Ladislaus Pyrker (then Patriarch of Venice) and others came to watch him paint. So devoted was Etty to his studies in Venice that he exhibited no original work in 1823, writing to his brother that &quot;If one spent all the time in painting originals, one might as well, nay better, be at home&quot;. The members of the Venetian Academy were so impressed by Etty that he was elected an Honorary Academician.
By 7 June 1823, Etty felt that he had reached the limits of what he could accomplish in Venice, and was considering returning home. Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence, with the intention of creating a full-size replica of Titian&#x27;s &quot;Venus of Urbino&quot;, considered one of the finest works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the Uffizi management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among the finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months in Venice. On 8 October 1823 Etty left Venice, travelling via Mantua and Geneva to Paris.

Etty had intended to travel to England, but instead remained in Paris, to resume copying works in Paris galleries, collecting prints and buying a lay figure and around 200 paintbrushes, both of which the French made to a higher standard than English manufacturers. In early January 1824, Etty returned to London.

== Success and controversy (1824–1835) ==
As soon as he arrived home, Etty began to work on ensuring he had at least one picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of Pandora and in particular the passage in Hesiod in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of &quot;Pandora&quot;, Vulcan and Venus.

&quot;Pandora Crowned by the Seasons&quot; is an unusual composition, painted to resemble a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan to one side and Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture&#x27;s composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty&#x27;s fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty&#x27;s history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.

Although recognisably descended from earlier works such as &quot;The Coral Finder&quot;, &quot;Pandora&quot; was a far more accomplished work than those Etty exhibited prior to his travels. Although some critics were reluctant to accept Etty&#x27;s combination of realistic figures and an unrealistic setting (Etty&#x27;s 1958 biographer Dennis Farr characterises the critical reaction to &quot;Pandora&quot; as &quot;grudging admiration not unmixed with philistinism&quot;), his fellow artists were extremely impressed with it, to the extent that Thomas Lawrence bought the painting at the 1824 Summer Exhibition.

In the wake of the success of &quot;Pandora&quot;, Etty moved to an apartment in Buckingham Street, near the Strand, where he was to reside for the remainder of his working life. Shortly afterwards he applied to become an Associate of the Royal Academy for the first time, and on 1 November was duly elected, beating William Allan by 16 votes to seven. (&quot;The Times&quot;, at this time still hostile to Etty for his perceived indecency, sneered that &quot;this cannot be as an honour conferred on Mr. Etty: if it were, he has deserved and should have obtained it long ago&quot;. The same reviewer did concede that Etty&#x27;s copy of Tintoretto&#x27;s &quot;Esther Before Ahaseurus&quot; was &quot;the most important picture in the room&quot; in their report on an exhibition held at the British Institution of significant copies of paintings.)

===Betsy Etty===
In the years following his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a typical day he woke at 7 am, painting from around 9 or 10 am until 4 pm, after which he had a meal. Following the meal he took a walk, and attended life classes between 6 and 8 pm. On returning home he drank two cups of tea, and went to bed at midnight.

Etty was considered extremely unattractive, described by his 1855 biographer Alexander Gilchrist—a great admirer—as &quot;Slovenly in attire, short and awkward in body—large head, large hands, large feet—a face marked with the small-pox, made still more noticeable by length of jaw, and a quantity of sandy hair, long and wild: all, conspired to make him &#x27;one of the oddest looking creatures&#x27; in a Young Lady&#x27;s eyes—what she would call &#x27;a sight&#x27;; one, not redeemed (to her), by the massive brow, its revelation of energy and power, the sign-manual of Genius there legible.&quot;

One of his few close companions was his niece Betsy (Elizabeth Etty), fifth daughter of his brother John. Betsy was unmarried and 14 years younger than William, and became his housekeeper in 1824. She remained in his service for the rest of his life, and as he grew older William increasingly came to depend on her, suffering distress whenever they were apart and regularly writing to her in panic whenever he did not hear from her. She became his companion and acted as his assistant, alongside his official assistant George Franklin.
While he appears to have been attracted to young women throughout his life, and there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice, there is no suggestion that he ever had a sexual relationship with Betsy of any kind. He recorded in his diary in 1830 that &quot;it is best I have not married because I have not noisy Children and can have nice Books, and Pictures etc&quot;. He suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life, and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout, although he was popular with fellow artists and students. Etty rarely socialised, preferring to concentrate on his painting; when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes, he indignantly replied that &quot;it fills up a couple of hours in the evening, I should be at a loss how else to employ&quot;.

As she grew older Betsy suffered from numerous illnesses, the exact natures of which are not recorded but which are known to have caused William great concern. William began to fear that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him. In 1843 his younger brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William&#x27;s regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.
===&quot;The Combat&quot;===
Spurred by the reception of &quot;Pandora&quot;, in 1825 Etty exhibited his most ambitious work to date, &quot;The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished&quot;. This was a huge canvas, 399 cm (13 ft 1 in) across, showing a woman pleading for the life of a defeated soldier as another soldier prepares to kill him. Highly unusually for a history painting at the time, Etty did not base &quot;The Combat&quot; on an incident from literature, religion or history, but instead painted a scene entirely from his own imagination, based on an idea which had first occurred to him in 1821. (He was later to describe this type of painting as &quot;that class of compositions called by the Romans &quot;Visions&quot;, not having their origin in history or poetry&quot;.)

&quot;The Combat&quot; was extremely well received, even by critics who had previously been hostile to Etty. In terms of composition and technique it was considered as equalling or even surpassing Titian and Veronese, and one critic considered it &quot;one of the finest and most masterly works that ever graced the walls of the Royal Academy&quot;, while those critics who had previously dismissed Etty for his supposed obscenity reconsidered their opinions in light of it. &quot;The Combat&quot; continued to be one of Etty&#x27;s best-regarded works, and formed the basis of a successful 1848 engraving by George Thomas Doo.

Following the success of &quot;The Combat&quot;, Etty painted a further four very large paintings. One was on the well-worn theme of the Judgement of Paris, exhibited in 1826, and three were on the theme of Judith beheading Holofernes, the first of which was exhibited in 1827. Unlike other artists who had painted this subject, Etty&#x27;s &quot;Judith&quot; paintings did not show the actual beheading, as he hoped to avoid &quot;the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in&quot;. The first &quot;Judith&quot; picture in particular was extremely well received critically.

===Royal Academician===

In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.

For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; &quot;The World Before the Flood&quot;, &quot;Venus, the Evening Star&quot; and &quot;Guardian Cherubs&quot;. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both &quot;The World Before the Flood&quot; and &quot;Venus&quot; attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of &quot;The World Before the Flood&quot;—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; that it &quot;will serve to accompany the &quot;private&quot; Titians of that nobleman&quot;. Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent.
As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, &quot;Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs&quot;, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

====Life classes====
Even after he had achieved status as a full Royal Academician, Etty regularly attended life classes; fellow artist John Constable sarcastically wrote that &quot;Etty [sets] an excellent example to the Modles for regularity&quot;. His contemporaries considered this at best peculiar and at worst extremely inappropriate, complaining that for someone in his senior position to attend classes as a student was both unprofessional and unnecessary, and that it damaged the standing of the position of Academician; there were complaints that he had far outlasted the official student term of 10 years. Etty refused to give up attendance, offering to resign rather than give up his studies, and the Academy grudgingly allowed him to continue to attend classes. He divided his time between the RA&#x27;s own life classes and those at nearby St. Martin&#x27;s Lane.

Etty generally finished life studies during three evenings&#x27; sittings. On the first evening he would sketch the model in charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the second he used oil paints to fill in the figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint. He usually painted on millboard, re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or poses plastiques models, while his male models tended to be Life Guards recruited from the nearby barracks, who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public bath houses.

====&quot;Hero and Leander&quot;====

In the wake of Etty&#x27;s elevation to Academician, he exhibited two paintings at the Summer Exhibition in 1829, &quot;Benaiah, David&#x27;s Chief Captain&quot; and &quot;Hero, Having Thrown Herself from the Tower at the Sight of Leander Drowned, Dies on his Body&quot;. &quot;Benaiah&quot; is on the same large scale as &quot;The Combat&quot; at 398 cm (13 ft 1 in) wide, and is a very similar composition, although in place of the woman begging for mercy is the body of a dead soldier. &quot;Hero&quot; recycles the pose of the dead soldier from &quot;Benaiah&quot; as the dying Hero as she lies on the body of her dead lover. Unusually for Etty, &quot;Hero&quot; is painted in intentionally neutral tones rather than his usual Venetian colours, and the composition uses foreshortening of the bodies to create a single diagonal across the canvas. For the rest of his life, Etty considered &quot;Hero&quot; to be &quot;the finest of my fine pictures&quot;.
On 7 January 1830 Etty&#x27;s mentor Thomas Lawrence died, followed on 30 July by Etty&#x27;s mother. Etty was devastated by the loss, and was one of those considered to replace Lawrence as President of the Royal Academy, although in the event he did not stand for election. Possibly distracted by the death of Lawrence, Etty submitted only three paintings to the Summer Exhibition that year. One of these, &quot;Judith Going Forth&quot;, was an addition to &quot;Judith&quot;, which had been commissioned the previous year by that painting&#x27;s new owners, the Royal Scottish Academy.

====&quot;Candaules&quot;====

Of Etty&#x27;s two original works exhibited at the RA in 1830, &quot;The Storm&quot;, inspired by Psalm 22, attracted little interest and was dismissed by &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;—typically a staunch supporter of Etty&#x27;s work—as &quot;a sad failure&quot;. The other painting exhibited was &quot;Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed&quot;, which was to prove one of the most controversial works of Etty&#x27;s career. &quot;Candaules&quot; is based on a story from Herodotus in which king Candaules arranges for his servant Gyges to spy on his wife Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Gyges is discovered and at Nyssia&#x27;s behest kills Candaules, marries Nyssia and rules the kingdom in his stead. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia removes the last of her clothes. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty aimed for the viewer to feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master&#x27;s naked wife against his will and without her knowledge.
Etty felt that the work illustrated the moral that women are not chattels, and were entitled to punish men who violated their rights. He made little effort to explain this to his audience, and thus &quot;Candaules&quot; appeared morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges. From the moment it was unveiled &quot;Candaules&quot; was condemned as a cynical mix of a distasteful narrative and pornographic images, and there was near-unanimous consensus that it was inappropriate for public exhibition. The piece remained controversial long after Etty&#x27;s death; Alexander Gilchrist&#x27;s overwhelmingly flattering 1855 biography of Etty described it as &quot;almost the only instance among Etty&#x27;s works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject&quot;, while as late as 2011 Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote of &quot;Candaules&quot; that &quot;it is perhaps hard to see the painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise&quot;. &quot;Candaules&quot; was bought by wealthy collector Robert Vernon, who was in the process of building a major collection of British art and was to become one of Etty&#x27;s most important customers.

With the three paintings for the 1830 Summer Exhibition completed, Etty decided to pay another visit to Paris. Etty travelled via Brighton, arriving in Paris in early July 1830. He found the atmosphere of the city had become unpleasantly hedonistic, writing to Betsy that &quot;If I had a daughter, she should &quot;not&quot; be educated here. Pleasure and amusement are the idols.&quot;

France was in constitutional crisis in 1830, which reached a peak in late July as the July Revolution began and riots erupted across Paris. Although moved by the death and destruction taking place around him, Etty felt that the purpose of his visit was to study paintings, and continued to attend the Louvre to copy paintings as the violence raged in the surrounding streets. On 31 July he decided to abandon the trip; abandoning his proposed onward journey to Brussels and Antwerp, he collected the five copies he had made in the Louvre and set off for London.
The works Etty painted following his return began to show a departure in style from his previous efforts. While the figures in his previous original paintings had been painted from sketches of models made in the studio or life classes, from now on he began to work from memory, and as a consequence his figures began to appear more idealised; Farr (1958) describes his figures from now on as less to a particular aspect of the model than to a preconceived notion of what the model ought to look like&quot;.

====&quot;Youth and Pleasure&quot; and &quot;The Destroying Angel&quot;====
In 1832 Etty returned to the theme of &quot;A Sketch from One of Gray&#x27;s Odes&quot;, exhibited in 1822 to such disdain from the press. The result was &quot;Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm&quot;, which remains one of his best known works. Illustrating a passage from &quot;The Bard&quot;, a poem by Thomas Gray, &quot;Youth and Pleasure&quot; has been described as &quot;a poetic romance&quot;. It shows a gilded boat being propelled by the breath of a nude child on the sails; one nude figure representing Pleasure languidly holds the helm of the boat. A nude child blows bubbles, which another nude on the prow of the ship, representing Youth, reaches to catch. Naiads, again nude, swim around and clamber onto the boat.

&quot;The Bard&quot; was about the English destruction of Welsh culture and the subsequent decline of the House of Plantagenet and its replacement by the Welsh House of Tudor, and there was a general feeling among critics that Etty had misunderstood the point of the metaphors used by Gray. Etty claimed that his unusual interpretation of the text was intended to create &quot;a general allegory of Human Life, its empty vain pleasures—if not founded on the laws of Him who is the Rock of Ages&quot;, and that the painting served as a moral warning about the pursuit of empty pleasure. This explanation appears to have left critics unconvinced. Even those critics most favourable towards Etty&#x27;s technical accomplishments in creating the picture found it hard to ascertain what the painting was supposed to represent; other critics were more openly hostile, with &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot; condemning it as &quot;indulgence of what we once hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind&quot;. Purchased for a huge sum by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, &quot;Youth and Pleasure&quot; remained controversial long after Etty&#x27;s death, with Farr&#x27;s 1958 biography describing it as &quot;singularly inept&quot;.
Also exhibited at the 1832 Summer Exhibition along with &quot;Youth and Pleasure&quot; was &quot;The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate&quot;, seen as a riposte by Etty to his critics. Another of what Etty deemed &quot;visions&quot;, depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than one from literature, mythology or history, &quot;The Destroying Angel&quot; shows an imaginary classical temple under attack from a destroying angel and a group of daemons. The human figures, intentionally painted in paler tones than usual to suggest death, each show their fear in a different way. Painted soon after his 1830 travels, it is thought that the heaped corpses and terrified crowds were directly inspired by events Etty had witnessed in Paris.

Unlike &quot;Youth and Pleasure&quot;, the critical response to &quot;The Destroying Angel&quot; was generally favourable even from those critics usually hostile to Etty. The painting generated favourable comparisons to Michelangelo and Rubens, and Etty&#x27;s early supporter William Carey (writing under the name of &quot;Ridolfi&quot;) considered it to be evidence of Etty&#x27;s &quot;redeeming grace and spirit&quot;. The painting was explicitly seen as a renunciation by Etty of his previous nude studies, with &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; described it as &quot;a sermon to [Etty&#x27;s] admirers ... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that &quot;little&quot; gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils&quot;.
At around this time Etty began to receive many unsolicited letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as to appeal to the nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers&#x27;s suggestions seriously.

===Illness and recovery===

In mid-1833 Etty began a portrait of the daughters of Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn, the long-serving Conservative Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire, titled &quot;Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball&quot;. Etty was then little-known for portraits, but had recently completed &quot;Elizabeth Potts&quot;, a portrait of the daughter of a family friend, which although poorly received by some critics was technically highly accomplished. He said at the time that he hoped his portrait of the Williams-Wynn children would be &quot;one of my best&quot;.

In February 1834, Etty became seriously ill, and was incapacitated for four months. Unable to paint, he exhibited only two already-completed paintings in the 1834 Summer Exhibition, &quot;Elizabeth Potts&quot; and &quot;The Cardinal&quot;. In June of that year he left London to convalesce, renting a cottage in York. Weak and unable to concentrate, Etty painted very little, and spent the next few months visiting friends and touring the sights of Yorkshire. Gradually regaining his health, he returned to London in December 1834, and resumed work on those paintings he had left incomplete on the onset of his illness.
Making up for lost time during illness, he completed several significant works over the next few months, and exhibited eight paintings at the 1835 Summer Exhibition. These included works now considered among his most significant. &quot;The Bridge of Sighs, Venice&quot; was based on sketches made by Etty during his visit to that city in the early 1820s. It shows the aftermath of an execution, as two men haul the body away to be thrown into the sea; it was described as &quot;poetry on canvas&quot; by William Macready, who bought it from Etty. &quot;Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball&quot; was the portrait of the daughters of Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn which Etty had begun in 1833. Etty had put far more work into this than was usual for a portrait, remarking to the Williams-Wynn family that he intended &quot;to make a fine work of Art as well as a resemblance&quot;. Showing Williams-Wynn&#x27;s daughters Charlotte and Mary in elaborate Italian-style costumes, it was critically well received as evidence that Etty was able to paint a major work that did not rely on nudity, as well as demonstrating that Etty could paint on commission for the elite, leading to further commissions. &quot;The Warrior Arming&quot; was a study of Godfrey de Bouillon, painted to satisfy the then-current fad for medievalism. Etty had recently developed an interest in collecting pieces of armour, and &quot;The Warrior Arming&quot; is a technically adept study of the effects of lights from multiple sources shining on polished armour.

The most contentious of Etty&#x27;s 1835 RA exhibits was &quot;Venus and Her Satellites&quot;, a depiction of the Toilet of Venus. This was condemned in much of the press as pornographic, and was described as having a &quot;total absence of soul&quot;, with &quot;The Observer&quot; in particular extremely hostile, calling for the Archbishop of Canterbury to become involved in chastising Etty for his lack of taste. Despite this condemnation, Etty considered &quot;Venus and her Satellites&quot; one of his best works, and sold it to Rev. Edward Pryce Owen for the substantial sum of 300 guineas (about £ in 2025 terms) in August.

In August 1835 Etty spent a brief holiday in Shropshire, where he delivered &quot;Venus and Her Satellites&quot; to Owen. While en route back he made a detour to Manchester to visit an art exhibition; while there he made the acquaintance of wealthy cotton merchant Daniel Grant.

===Etty and York===
After Jonathan Martin&#x27;s arson attack on York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were proposals by the dean and chapter to take the opportunity of the destruction to restructure the interior of the building. Etty was prominent in the effort to resist the redesign and to restore the building to its original state. A campaign led by Etty and other notable York residents was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.
By the time of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body responsible for local government) was already engaged in a debate about the future of the city&#x27;s defensive walls. The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates (&quot;Bars&quot;) had become a public health hazard given the number of locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable. The Bars restricted stagecoaches, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city&#x27;s slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of the walls. Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished. In the face of this a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824, but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete &quot;Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs&quot; was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls.
In February 1832 Etty began a campaign of writing to local York newspapers urging the preservation of the walls, and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation in light of the damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile to the preservation campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to a railway station within the walls galvanised Etty, and he delivered two lectures on the preservation of the walls during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty&#x27;s words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls, much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the running of trains to both north and south. While the walls were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty&#x27;s death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and the preservation of the walls was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.

In 1838, Etty started lobbying for the establishment of an art school in York. He proposed that the Hospitium of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey be used for this purpose, with the lower floor becoming a museum of sculpture and the upper floor becoming a school and exhibition hall. The Hospitium scheme was abandoned, but the York School of Design duly opened on a different site in 1842. Although the school was created by an artist who had built his reputation on nudes, nude art remained controversial. In 1847, following a complaint from a female student about a display of replicas of Ancient Greek sculptures, &quot;the master was requested to have the penis of each of the offending statues cut off [...] a proceeding that called forth the indignation of the male students and the remonstrances of even the lady students&quot;.

==Later life (1836–1849)==

In 1836 architect John Harper arranged a small exhibition in York of works by modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of &quot;Venus and her Doves&quot;, which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty retrospectives were held for some years. Harper did take the opportunity to buy Etty&#x27;s &quot;A Family of the Forest&quot; (also known as &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot;), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. &quot;A Family of the Forest&quot; illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem &quot;Theogony&quot;, dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man looking away from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.

By this time, Etty was becoming conflicted religiously. Although he had been raised as a Methodist, following Catholic emancipation in 1829 Etty became increasingly drawn to Roman Catholicism. Although he considered himself &quot;in [my] heart&#x27;s core deeply and sincerely of the Ancient Faith&quot;, he refused formally to convert to Catholicism owing to concerns that it would upset his family and friends, worries that he would be denied access to Anglican buildings such as York Minster, and a distaste for the concept of auricular (spoken) confession. He remained closely associated with Catholicism throughout his later life, and was one of the few non-Catholics to attend the 1838 opening of Augustus Pugin&#x27;s chapel for St Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott, at the time the most important Roman Catholic building in England.

===&quot;The Sirens and Ulysses&quot;===
Also in 1836 Etty began work on &quot;The Sirens and Ulysses&quot;, which he considered among his greatest works, and which is his largest surviving painting. Measuring 442.5 cm by 297 cm (14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in) &quot;Sirens&quot; was based on a passage from Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; in which sailors resist the irresistible song of the Sirens. The theme and scale of the painting were probably suggested to Etty by Thomas Myers, who had been encouraging Etty to paint very large canvases. Myers&#x27;s suggested theme appealed to Etty, who later wrote that it illustrated &quot;the importance of resisting &quot;Sensual Delights&quot;&quot;. Etty made every effort to ensure realism in the picture, going as far as to visit mortuaries to sketch corpses in varying stages of decay to ensure the accuracy of the cadavers on the beach.

When Etty completed &quot;Sirens&quot; in 1837, it was one of the main attractions at the 1837 Summer Exhibition, the first to be held in the Royal Academy&#x27;s new building in Trafalgar Square (now part of the National Gallery). The painting, with its juxtaposition of male and female nudity and decaying corpses, immediately divided opinion. Some critics considered it one of the finest artworks ever made, with &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; particularly taken with the work, describing &quot;Sirens&quot; as &quot;a historical work of the first class&quot; and &quot;by far the best that Mr. Etty ever painted&quot;. Other critics were less kind; &quot;The Spectator&quot; considered it &quot;a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridity—glowing in colour and wonderful in execution, but conceived in the worst possible taste&quot;.
Possibly because of its size, &quot;The Sirens and Ulysses&quot; failed to sell at the Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 Etty met again with Daniel Grant who, without having seen the painting, offered £250 (about £ in today&#x27;s terms) for &quot;Sirens&quot; and for &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, also exhibited by Etty that year. Etty, poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio, sold both paintings to Grant for well below their true worth. Etty had used a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which flaked when dry, and as soon as it was complete &quot;Sirens&quot; began to deteriorate. It was shown at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition but then considered in too poor a condition for further public display, and placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In 2006 restoration began on it, and in May 2010 &quot;Sirens&quot; was returned to public display and is now one of the key works in the Manchester Art Gallery.

===Decline===

After &quot;Sirens&quot;, Etty&#x27;s output remained as high as ever, with seven paintings exhibited at the 1838 Summer Exhibition, but the quality of his work is generally considered to have gone into decline. By 1838 critics began to comment that Etty&#x27;s paintings were no longer inventive but simply reworkings of his earlier paintings, while in June of that year William Makepeace Thackeray (under the pen name of Michael Angelo Titmarsh) wrote that is, like great men, lazy, or indifferent, perhaps, about public approbation&quot;. By 1839, criticisms of Etty were being raised in even those newspapers and journals which had previously championed his work. A new type of criticism of Etty also began to appear in 1839, from a new generation led by &quot;The Art Union&quot;, who praised Etty&#x27;s technical abilities but saw his choice of subjects as out of touch and anachronistic, and &quot;very frequently doing as little good for mankind as the priest who preaches his sermon in Latin&quot;.

From around this time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief that the purpose of art is to illustrate moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint still lifes, beginning with &quot;Pheasant and Peach&quot; (likely to be the painting now called &quot;Dead Pheasant and Fruit&quot;); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty&#x27;s decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.

In May 1840, Etty made the trip to Brussels and Antwerp which he had been forced by revolution to abandon in 1830. He intended to study the works of Rubens, but the briefness of his tour—in the company of Betsy Etty he visited Ostend, Bruges, Antwerp, Brussels, Aachen, Cologne, Bonn and Rotterdam in the course of ten days—meant he had little time for study. The following year he returned to Antwerp and Mechelen for a longer visit to visit St. Rumbold&#x27;s Cathedral and to study the substantial collections of Rubens paintings in the two cities. On this second journey he twice visited a Trappist monastery outside Antwerp, staying overnight on one visit, and bought a Trappist habit; he also bought a Capuchin habit from a monastery in Bruges. These acquisitions prompted paintings on monastic themes over subsequent years.
Despite a perceived decline in his work&#x27;s quality, the 1840s were the most financially successful of Etty&#x27;s career. His income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class, and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared, Etty was in a position to invest money for the first time. By 1841 Etty had around £300 invested, rising to £8500 in 1845 and £17,000 in 1849. He continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than Betsy Etty, writing in his diary in 1843 that &quot;being in sound Mind and Body I declare it to be my &quot;Firm Intention&quot; NEVER TO MARRY. In which resolution I pray GOD to help me that I may devote myself purely to my Art, my Country, and my GOD!&quot;

In May 1843, Etty was one of eight artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes on the theme of Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot; for a new pavilion being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of &quot;Circe and the Sirens Three&quot;. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty&#x27;s fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of &quot;Hesperus&quot; he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.
The perceived lack of respect shown to one of England&#x27;s leading artists led to some outcry, and attacks in the press upon the then very unpopular Albert; William Makepeace Thackeray wrote in 1845: &quot;Think of the greatest patronage in the world giving forty pounds for pictures worth four hundred—condescending to buy works from humble men who could not refuse, and paying for them below their value! Think of august powers and principalities ordering the works of such a great artist as Etty to be hacked out of the palace-wall! That was a slap in the face to every artist in England.&quot;

In August 1843, during a break from his work on the fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final overseas journey. Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of Joan of Arc, and he wanted to visit places associated with her. Setting out on 16 August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and Orléans associated with her life. Unlike Etty&#x27;s disastrous prior visits to France, this journey passed without incident, and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.

====&quot;Musidora&quot; and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;====
In the same year, Etty painted the first version of &quot;&quot;, an illustration from the poem &quot;Summer&quot; by James Thomson and arguably Etty&#x27;s last history painting painted while he still had all his powers. &quot;Musidora&quot; shows a scene in which the titular character, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into &quot;the lucid coolness of the flood&quot; to &quot;bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream&quot;, unknowing that she is being watched by her suitor Damon. Etty&#x27;s composition is shown from the viewpoint of Damon; by so doing Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon&#x27;s dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as &quot;a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome&quot;. &quot;Musidora&quot; met with almost universal acclaim, compared favourably to Titian and Rembrandt, and described by &quot;The Critic&quot; as &quot;a preeminent work&quot; and &quot;the triumph of the British school&quot;.

By the time &quot;Musidora&quot; was exhibited, Etty&#x27;s health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, it was not unusual for passers-by to accuse him of drunkenness as he made his way wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28 ft (8.5 m) in total width and 9 ft 9 in (3 m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.
Etty sold the triptych for the huge sum of 2500 guineas (about £ in 2025 terms) to dealer Richard Colls and the engraver C. W. Wass. Colls and Wass had ambitious plans to recoup their money by selling engravings of the pictures and by taking the paintings on a tour of Britain and Europe. The paintings proved less popular than expected. Very few engravings were sold and the tours did not take place; Wass declared bankruptcy in 1852. The paintings were separated, and sold on to a series of buyers, with the third panel fetching just 7 guineas in 1893 as Etty&#x27;s popularity continued to wane. By the 1950s all three panels of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; were believed lost or destroyed, although some preliminary studies survive. The first panel which showed Joan of Arc finding the sword in the church of St. Catherine de Fierbois ended up in the collection of Llantarnam Abbey, Cwmbran, South Wales [In 2021 the panel was sold at auction by Bonhams]. The second panel is in the collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts d&#x27;Orléans. The third panel has since been lost.

===Retrospective and death===

Following the completion of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, Etty&#x27;s health continued to deteriorate. He continued to paint and exhibit, but his retirement plans grew firmer. In April 1846 he bought a house in Coney Street, central York, as a retirement home, and in December 1847 he formally resigned from the Council of the Royal Academy. Following structural alterations to give him a better view of the river, Etty moved into the house in June 1848, completing the move in September, although he retained his London apartments. His move from London caused some consternation among that city&#x27;s models, who were losing one of their most regular customers, as well as concerns from Etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in York.

He continued to exhibit, sending seven paintings to that year&#x27;s Summer Exhibition, but they drew little interest, although the lack of nudes was applauded by some reviewers. By this time, Robert Vernon&#x27;s bequest of his collection to the nation had led to eleven Etty paintings going on public display in the cellars of the National Gallery. In late 1848 he wrote a brief autobiography, published the following year in &quot;The Art Journal&quot;, in which he staunchly defended himself against the accusations of pornography which had been levelled at him throughout his life:

In 1849, the Royal Society of Arts decided to organise a retrospective exhibition of Etty&#x27;s work, the first since the minor York exhibition of 1836. Etty agreed only on condition that all nine of his large works were included. The three &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; paintings were in London and easily accessible, and the Royal Scottish Academy was happy to lend &quot;The Combat&quot;, &quot;Benaiah&quot; and the &quot;Judith&quot; triptych, but the Royal Manchester Institution was deeply reluctant to lend &quot;The Sirens and Ulysses&quot; in light of concerns that transporting it would damage the fragile paintwork further. They were eventually persuaded to lend the piece after Etty and some of his friends visited Manchester to personally request they release it. The exhibition went ahead from 9 June to 25 August 1849, bringing together 133 Etty paintings for the first time; Etty hoped that it would raise public awareness of his abilities, writing to his friend Rev. Isaac Spencer &quot;Please God, I will give them a taste of my quality&quot;. The exhibition was well received and well attended; even Etty&#x27;s old adversaries at the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; recommending that readers &quot;lose no time in visiting this collection&quot;. It was a financial disaster for the Royal Society of Arts, faced with the cost of transporting large numbers of delicate artworks from around the country.

During the exhibition Etty suffered a serious bout of rheumatic fever. Exhausted by illness and the stress of the exhibition, when the exhibition was complete he returned to York in very poor health. On 3 November 1849 he suffered a serious asthma attack, thought to have been made worse by his neglecting to wear his flannel undershirt the night before. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and by 10 November he was bedridden. On Tuesday 13 November, watching the sun set over the River Ouse, he was heard to say &quot;Wonderful! Wonderful! This death!&quot; Later that night, Betsy Etty wrote to Joseph Gillott that &quot;Uncle paid the last debt to nature at past Eight tonight. I do not know what to do. I am almost broken hearted. I have lost my best friend. I not what to do. I can say no more.&quot;

==Legacy==
Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave&#x27;s Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty&#x27;s work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 &quot;It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds&quot;.

Six months after William&#x27;s death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87.
While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty&#x27;s early works but recoiled from his later style. Holman Hunt recollected that &quot;in my youth [Etty] had lost the robustness he once had [...] the paintings of his advanced age cloyed the taste by their sweetness&quot;. Millais had consciously modelled his style on Etty, and his works prior to the formation of the Pre-Raphaelites are very similar in composition, but after 1848 the only similarity in style is the use of colour. As Pre-Raphaelitism waned Millais&#x27;s style became more varied, and some of his later work such as &quot;The Knight Errant&quot; owes a strong debt to Etty&#x27;s influence.
During his life Etty had acquired followers such as Irish painters William Mulready and Daniel Maclise, but both rejected Etty&#x27;s preoccupation with nudes. Mulready painted nudes but became best known for domestic genre paintings, while Maclise chose to specialise in more traditional history paintings and exhibited only one nude work in his career. One of the few painters who consciously attempted to continue Etty&#x27;s style after his death was William Edward Frost, who had been an acquaintance of Etty&#x27;s since 1825. In the early 1830s Frost painted on commission for Thomas Potts (whose 1833 commission of Etty to paint his daughter Elizabeth&#x27;s portrait had been Etty&#x27;s first significant portrait commission), and later was commissioned on Etty&#x27;s recommendation to paint a portrait of Etty&#x27;s cousin Thomas Bodley. Frost successfully imitated Etty throughout his career, to the extent that his figure studies and Etty&#x27;s are often misattributed to each other. Although Frost eventually became a Royal Academician in 1870, by this time Etty&#x27;s style of painting had badly fallen out of fashion.
Victorian painting had gone through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites had given way to the ideas of the Aesthetic Movement, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty&#x27;s. The new generation of history painters such as Edward Burne-Jones, Lawrence Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty&#x27;s works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential Modernist movement, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from Paul Cézanne and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.

In 1911 the city of York belatedly recognised Etty. A statue of Etty by G. W. Milburn was unveiled on 1 February outside the York Art Gallery in Exhibition Square, and a retrospective of 164 Etty paintings was held at the gallery despite opposition from some of Etty&#x27;s descendants who refused to lend works for it. William Wallace Hargrove, proprietor of the &quot;York Herald&quot;, gave a speech recalling his memories of knowing Etty. Outside York, Etty generally remained little-known, with the majority of those galleries holding his works, other than the Lady Lever Art Gallery, the Russell-Cotes Museum and Anglesey Abbey, tending to keep them in storage. Minor Etty exhibitions in London in 1936 and 1938 had little impact, and likewise an exhibition of 30 Etty paintings in 1948 to mark the reopening of the York Art Gallery and another York exhibition of 108 paintings the following year to mark the centenary of his death. In 2001–02 five Etty paintings were included in Tate Britain&#x27;s landmark &quot;Exposed: The Victorian Nude&quot; exhibition, which did much to raise Etty&#x27;s profile, and established Etty as &quot;the first British artist to paint the nude with both seriousness and consistency&quot;. The restoration of &quot;The Sirens and Ulysses&quot;, completed in 2010, led to increased interest in Etty, and in 2011–12 a major exhibition of Etty&#x27;s works was held at the York Art Gallery. The York Art Gallery continues to hold the largest collection of Etty&#x27;s works.

<doc id="379013" wikidata="Q3902685" url="?curid=379013" title="Pico (programming language)">
<text>Pico is a programming language developed at the Software Languages Lab at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, intended to be simple, powerful, extensible, and easy to read. The language was created to introduce the essentials of programming to non-computer science students.

Pico can be seen as an effort to generate a palatable and enjoyable language for people who do not want to study hard for the elegance and power of a language. They have done it by adapting Scheme&#x27;s semantics.

While designing Pico, the Software Languages Lab was inspired by the Abelson and Sussman&#x27;s book &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot;. Furthermore, they were influenced by the teaching of programming at high school or academic level.

Pico should be interpreted as &#x27;small&#x27;, the idea was to create a small language for educational purposes.

== Language elements ==
De Meuter, Gonzalez, and D&#x27;Hondt describe the Pico syntax as being &quot;two-tiered.&quot; The first layer consists of simple rules for writing small programs in a functional programming style.

=== Comments ===
Comments are surrounded by backquotes (&quot;`&quot;).

=== Variables ===
Variables are dynamically typed; Pico uses static scope.
 var: value

=== Functions ===
Functions, like everything in Pico, are first-class objects, meaning they can be assigned to variables and passed to and returned from functions. Also, there are no anonymous functions in Pico; functions must have a name. For example, a function, codice_1, with two parameters, codice_2 and codice_3, can be defined as:
 func(param1, param2): ...

Functions can be called with the following syntax:
 func(arg1, arg2)

=== Operators ===
Operators can be used as prefix or infix in Pico:
 +(5, 2)
 5 + 2

=== Data types ===
Pico has the following types: string, integer, real and tables.

It does not have a native char type, so users should resort to size 1 strings.

Tables are compound data structures that may contain any of the regular data types.

Boolean types are represented by functions (as in lambda calculus).

=== Control structures ===
==== Conditional evaluation ====
Only the usual if statement is included
 if(condition, then, else)

== Code snippets ==
 display(&#x27;Hello World&#x27;, eoln)

 max(a, b):
 if(a &lt; b, b, a)

 `http://www.paulgraham.com/accgen.html`
 foo(n): fun(i): n := n+i

== Implementations ==
=== Mac OS, Mac OS X ===
*MacPico
*XPico

=== Windows ===
*WinPico &quot;This version is buggy&quot;
*WinPico stable

=== Linux ===
*TextPico for Linux

=== Cross-platform ===
*sPico for DrScheme

<doc id="379018" wikidata="Q216655" url="?curid=379018" title="Metal Gear">
<text>is a franchise of stealth games created by Hideo Kojima. Developed and published by Konami, the first game, &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, was released in 1987 for MSX home computers. The player often takes control of a special forces operative (usually Solid Snake or Big Boss), who is assigned the task of finding the titular superweapon, &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, a bipedal walking tank with the ability to launch nuclear weapons.

Several sequels have been released for multiple consoles, which have expanded the original game&#x27;s plot, adding characters opposing and supporting Snake, while several prequels have explored the origins of Metal Gear and recurring characters. The third game in the series, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; for the PlayStation, marked a transition to 3D graphics and gained the series international fame. 

The series is credited for pioneering and popularizing stealth video games and &quot;cinematic video games&quot;. Notable traits of the series include cinematic cutscenes, intricate storylines, offbeat and fourth-wall humor, and exploration of cyberpunk, dystopian, political and philosophical themes, as well as references to Hollywood films. Individual installments have been critically acclaimed, as well as receiving several awards. The series has sold 62.4 million units as of December 2024. The franchise has also been adapted into other media, such as comics, novels, and drama CDs. Solid Snake has also gone on to appear in other games, such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, &quot;Ape Escape 3&quot;, &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot;, and &quot;Fortnite&quot;.

==Games==
Hideo Kojima designed the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, which debuted in Japan and Europe in 1987 for the MSX2 computer platform. A separate team created a heavily modified Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) port of the game that was released in Japan on December 22, 1987, North America in June 1988, and Europe and Australia sometime in 1989. Konami produced an NES sequel, &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, again without Kojima, released in North America and Europe in 1990. One of that game&#x27;s designers became acquainted with Kojima and asked him to create a &quot;real &quot;Metal Gear&quot; sequel&quot;. In reaction, Kojima began development of &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, which was released in Japan in 1990 for the MSX2.

Following &quot;Metal Gear 2&quot;″s completion, Kojima worked on other projects before directing his third &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, for the PlayStation. It began development in 1994 and debuted at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, before being released in 1998. The success of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; resulted in a series of sequels, prequels, spin-offs, ports, and remakes for Microsoft Windows, the Game Boy Color, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was followed up by the sequel &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; released in November 2001 for the PlayStation 2. A remake of the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; called &quot;Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes&quot; was released for the Nintendo GameCube in early 2004. Later that year, the third numbered entry, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, was released on the PlayStation 2. This is the first prequel which was set prior to all the previously released Metal Gear games and which acted as an origin to the franchise. These games were followed by a sequel to &quot;Snake Eater&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot;, which was released on the PlayStation Portable in 2006. The series&#x27; main storyline was concluded in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; for the PlayStation 3 in 2008. The game featured a multiplayer spin-off called &quot;Metal Gear Online&quot;.

In April 2010, another sequel to &quot;Snake Eater&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, was released for the PlayStation Portable and was set shortly after the events of &quot;Portable Ops&quot;. The spin-off game, &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;, was released in 2013 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and in Jan 2014 on Steam (PC). The game is set after &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot; and stars Raiden, the protagonist of &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; who turned into a cyborg ninja.

Expanded re-releases of games in the series were produced as well, such as &quot;Integral&quot; (&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;), &quot;Substance&quot; (&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;), and &quot;Subsistence&quot; (&quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;). The series&#x27; portable installments are usually set outside the main storyline. &quot;Metal Gear: Ghost Babel&quot; was released for the Game Boy Color, and several games were released for Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Portable. In a departure from the series&#x27; style, &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot; and its sequel used turn-based strategy mechanics based on collectible cards.

On May 18, 2009, a teaser site for the following installment in the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series was uploaded by Kojima Production. The site initially consisted of a series of countdowns leading to several flashing letters and the images of two characters looking like a middle-aged Big Boss and a cyborg Raiden. An article published in the July 2009 issue of &quot;Famitsu PSP + PS3&quot; covers the content of the site and features an interview with Hideo Kojima. The interview, revealing many details, is heavily censored and was published that way as a request by Kojima, who was directing and designing the new game. Famitsu was to publish the full interview in its following issue. The new game was eventually revealed to be &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;, which was announced on June 1, 2009, at E3, during the Microsoft Press Conference.

At E3 2010, a demo, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3D: Snake Eater – The Naked Sample&quot;, was shown on the Nintendo 3DS. The official E3 Kojima site later released screenshots and official art for the demo. Kojima did state, however, that this was not a preview for a full game but just a sample of what could be done on the 3DS hardware. Another mobile port of a previously released game was shown at Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Meeting on January 27, 2011, where Hideo Kojima demonstrated a possible portable version of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; for the upcoming PlayStation Vita.

On June 2, 2011, Konami announced the &quot;Metal Gear Solid HD Collection&quot; which was released in November 2011 for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The collection features remastered versions of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, and &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, rendered in 720p and running at 60fps, including Trophies/Achievements, and remastered audio. On August 15, 2011, UK retailer Zavvi secured the exclusive right to sell the &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Ultimate HD Collection&quot; only available for the PlayStation 3, which was released on November 25.

In November 2011, Kojima discussed with &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)&quot; the series&#x27; future commenting an upcoming &quot;Metal Gear Solid 5&quot;. Kojima said: &quot;I think we&#x27;ll probably have to make it [a sequel to &quot;MGS4&quot;] at some point, but what that will be, we have no idea&quot;. Kojima stated that when Konami does get around to building the game, he will have less influence than he had on previous iterations in the series. After the mixed fan reactions of the reveal of the rebooted action gameplay focused spin-off &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;, Hideo Kojima reassured fans that an &quot;authentic stealth &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;&quot; sequel would be coming in the future.

During a discussion panel at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in March 2012, Kojima stated: &quot;I am working on something that I think will become the shining moment&quot; for his career and the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series. During the franchise&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Konami revealed a demo for a new game in the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes&quot;. A social game for the GREE, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Social Ops&quot;, was released in December 2012.

On December 7, 2012, a teaser for &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; was revealed on the Spike Video Game Awards. Following the teaser trailer, numerous video game-related websites and fansites reported the trailer&#x27;s seemed connection to the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series of video games.

On March 27, 2013, Kojima announced at GDC 2013 that &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; were two different portions of one work, &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,&quot; with &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes&quot; serving as the prologue and &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; serving as the main story. Snake&#x27;s usual English-language voice actor David Hayter was not cast for the role. Instead, Hollywood actor and producer Kiefer Sutherland portrayed the character through voice acting and facial capture.

In 2015, Konami revealed that they were recruiting new staff members to develop a new &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game as Kojima left the company. On August 17, 2016, Konami announced during Gamescom 2016 that a new &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game was in the works, known as &quot;Metal Gear Survive&quot;. It is a spin-off game as well as a supplemental to &quot;Metal Gear Solid V&quot; as a whole, taking place between &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;.

On May 24, 2023, during Sony&#x27;s PlayStation Showcase event, a remake of &quot;Snake Eater&quot;, titled &quot;Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&quot; was announced, as well as the &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1&quot;, which was released on October 24 of that year. It includes the first five mainline &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games, as well as extra content including the NES version of &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel&quot;, and &quot;Bande Dessinée&quot;, as well as additional content such as screenplay books, master books, character profiles, story summaries, strategy guides, and a playable soundtrack.

==Storyline==

In the Metal Gear universe, history had diverged at some point during World War II, with the fictional Cobra Unit, led by The Boss, being instrumental in the defeat of the Axis Powers. Cloning, AI and robotics technology of the 1970s are more advanced. The eleven games in the main &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series continuity reveal a narrative that spans five and a half decades, from the Cold War, until the near future. Big Boss is the most relevant character within the story of the series and of the canonical 11 games five are prequels centering on his story, set decades before the events of the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot;. However, Solid Snake is still depicted as the primary main character of the series, as the prequels create context of his purpose and him being the antithesis of his father.

===Plot===
&quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; which is chronologically the first game in the series, introduces &quot;Naked Snake&quot; (or &quot;Snake&quot; for short), an operative working for the fictional &quot;Force Operation X (FOX)&quot; unit of the CIA during the Cold War. The game focuses on the rise of Snake from an apprentice to a legendary soldier, as well as the downfall of his mentor and matriarchal figure, The Boss. After The Boss defects to the Soviet Union, Snake is sent into Russia to kill her and end the threat posed by Yevgeny Borisovitch Volgin, a GRU colonel with plans to overthrow the Soviet government. Snake&#x27;s heroics during the game earn him the nickname &quot;Big Boss&quot; at the end. The origins of The Patriots, an organization founded by Zero, are also explored.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot; serves as a direct sequel to &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; and follows Naked Snake&#x27;s life after disbanding from FOX. With Snake not yet accepting the Big Boss codename, the plot features the origins of his mercenary unit as he attempts to escape the San Hieronymo Peninsula and battles his old unit. The canonicity of &quot;Portable Ops&quot; is disputed, with Kojima having stated that &quot;the main story of &quot;Portable Ops&quot; is part of the Saga, is part of the official &quot;Metal Gear&quot; timeline, while some of the small details that are in &quot;Portable Ops&quot; are outside the Saga, not part of the main timeline of the game.&quot;

The next game, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, is set ten years after the events of &quot;Snake Eater&quot; and returns to the story of the young Big Boss. Now the head of the mercenary corporation Militaires Sans Frontières (MSF), Big Boss discovers that nuclear warheads are being transported to Latin America and decides that he must put a stop to it. &quot;Peace Walker&quot; features a new cast of characters to provide both aid and intelligence for Big Boss. A few characters from later games, such as a younger Kazuhira Miller, make appearances in the game.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, serves as the direct sequel to &quot;Peace Walker&quot; and is composed of two chapters. The prologue, &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot;, is set a few weeks after the final mission in &quot;Peace Walker&quot;, as Big Boss is tasked with rescuing two VIPs from a U.S. military black site on the coast of Cuba. Big Boss&#x27; mission coincides with a visit to Mother Base by the IAEA, which turns out to be a cover for an attack on Mother Base orchestrated by the mysterious organization XOF. In the chaos, Big Boss&#x27; helicopter collides with another, and he is sent to the hospital for nine years, which leads to the events of the main chapter, &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;. The basis of the main story revolves around Big Boss forming a new private military company, the Diamond Dogs to retaliate for the destruction of MSF and the loss of his comrades. However, this &quot;Big Boss&quot; is revealed to be a part of the medical staff who survived the helicopter crash, who was brainwashed to believe himself to be Big Boss, while the real Big Boss went into hiding to create Outer Heaven, a place where soldiers can live without having to abide by any particular ideology.

The first &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game for the MSX follows Solid Snake, a rookie of the FOXHOUND special operations unit. He is sent by his superior Big Boss to the fortress in South Africa known as Outer Heaven, with the goal of finding the missing squad member Gray Fox and investigating a weapon known as Metal Gear. However, after Snake unexpectedly completes his goals, Big Boss is revealed to be the leader of Outer Heaven, which he has created as a place for soldiers to fight free of any ideology that he believes has been forced upon them by governments. He fights Snake and is killed. However, it turns out that this was actually the body double from &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;. In &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; the real Big Boss has established a new military nation, Zanzibar Land, and he and Snake face off again, with Snake achieving victory and seemingly killing Big Boss for good.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; elaborates on the storyline of the earlier games and reveals that Solid Snake is a genetic clone of Big Boss, created as part of a secret government project. An antagonist is introduced in the form of Liquid Snake, Snake&#x27;s twin brother who takes control of FOXHOUND after Snake&#x27;s retirement. Liquid and FOXHOUND take control of a nuclear weapons disposal facility in Alaska and commandeer REX, the next-generation Metal Gear weapons platform being tested there. They threaten to detonate REX&#x27;s warhead unless the government turns over the remains of Big Boss. Solid Snake destroys Metal Gear REX and kills the renegade FOXHOUND members, with the exception of Revolver Ocelot.

A third Snake brother known as Solidus Snake is introduced as the United States President at the end of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and serves as the main antagonist of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;. During his time as president, Solidus became aware of a secretive cabal known as &quot;The Patriots&quot; who were steadily manipulating the course of history. After his tenure as president is over, Solidus takes control of the &quot;Big Shell&quot; offshore facility, which is being used to develop Arsenal Gear, a mobile undersea fortress designed to house and protect a network of AIs created to influence human development by filtering the availability of information across the Internet. The game is set four years after Liquid&#x27;s death in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, and it puts the player in control of Raiden, a soldier who fights against Solidus, who is revealed to be his former commander during his time as a child soldier. Raiden joins forces with Snake and learns that they are being manipulated by Revolver Ocelot, who has been working for the Patriots. At the end of the game, Ocelot seemingly becomes possessed by Liquid Snake as the nanomachines from Liquid&#x27;s arm (which Ocelot took to replace his own arm after Gray Fox slices it off in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;) work their way into Ocelot&#x27;s thought process.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; deals with a rapidly aging Solid Snake (now branded &quot;Old Snake&quot;) who is on a mission to find and defeat Revolver Ocelot, now known as Liquid Ocelot. Despite the destruction of the Arsenal Gear in &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;, the Patriots have continued in their plans to influence the course of human history, installing artificial intelligence systems around the world. Ocelot, opposed to this, has assembled armies with which to fight back and intends to hijack their entire operating system for his own ends. Solid Snake&#x27;s objective later changes to destroying the AIs of the Patriots and stop their oppression. After he and his allies succeed, Snake decides to live out his life peacefully.

&quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot; is set four years after &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot; and it stars Raiden as a cyborg ninja mercenary. Raiden joins the private military firm, Maverick Security Consulting, and is tasked with defending the prime minister of an unspecified African country. However, the situation goes awry and the prime minister is killed by a rival PMC company named Desperado Enforcement LLC. Raiden is defeated in the battle, but decides to re-avenge his failure and is sent out with a brand new cyborg body to fight the mysterious military group.

===Tone and themes===
The original &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, which was released in 1987 during the Cold War, dealt with the manipulation of soldiers by politicians of the East and West, countered by the concept of &quot;Outer Heaven&quot;, a country without politics. Its sequel &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, which was released in 1990 at the end of the Cold War, expanded on this with themes regarding political intrigue, battlefield ethics, military history, and the negative effects of warfare.

The overarching theme of the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series is that of the &quot;gene, meme, scene, sense, peace, revenge and race,&quot; and how people are affected by these factors according to the game&#x27;s producer Kojima—&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; deals with genetics and the moral implications of genetic engineering, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; deals with how identity can be affected by the philosophies of one&#x27;s society (a &quot;meme&quot;) and the effects of censorship on society, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; deals with how the time and place one lives in (a &quot;scene&quot;) affects their identity, how politics change along with the times and hyperreality, the inability to distinguish fact and fiction in an information-saturated world.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; deals with &quot;sense&quot;, which is a person&#x27;s understanding of the world that is lost when they die. It also encompasses how some things cannot be passed down to future generations and be misinterpreted as well as the artificially controlled (and globally shared) sense-data of the new era&#x27;s nanotech-enhanced soldiers. With &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; the plot deals with the true nature of &#x27;peace&#x27;, and the concept of conflict in human societies. &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; deals with the themes &quot;race&quot; and &quot;revenge&quot; and how the latter can make one lose his humanity. Following the initial Metal Gear, each game has been a deconstruction of action movies and video games, using tropes to invoke the themes and ideas especially those of spy movies - it examines what kind of mind and complete control of a situation would be needed to pull off the absurdly complex and convoluted plans that rely on events completely within the realm of chance yet comes off without a hitch. Furthermore, it examines what happens to a child soldier forced to take up a normal life through the characters Eli (also known as Liquid Snake) in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot; and Jack (primarily known as Raiden) in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;.

&quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot; also deals with &quot;revenge&quot;. Raiden is defeated in the beginning and feels a deep sense of vengeance, and as such exacts his &#x27;revenge&#x27; on the group who sabotaged him, as well as coming to terms with his own past and embracing his true nature. The games carry many implicit parallels to Nietzschean philosophy. Solid Snake serves as a deconstruction of the action hero archetype, as his wartime experiences have turned him into a bitter, broken-down soldier who wishes to retire, but cannot escape the life of conflict that had entwined him for so long. This concept is further explored through Raiden, who is put through the same torments as Snake in explicit detail. Big Boss is similarly not immune to this theme: as Naked Snake, he does not resemble a suave, impeccable secret agent that would otherwise fit into the 1960s spy film pastiche of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, but is instead an everyman character. Only after undergoing immense psychological and physical scarring does he begin to resemble the ultimate soldier known as Big Boss.

Although the series takes place in a realistic military setting, the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; video games also feature a strong focus on supernatural elements, leading the series to be commonly described as magic realism.

===Characters===

In games, players control a character who has to infiltrate into his enemy&#x27;s area alone to complete his mission. Across the mission, the player receives assistance from a supporting team communicated by Codec. While the team tells the player hints about the mission, it also helps expand the characters through their interactions. During their debuts, player characters Solid Snake and Raiden are meant to represent the player while in the following games they acquire more defined personalities. A common motif in the series is the use of powerful enemies. As games were released, new concepts were given to the bosses to make them innovative and notice their strength. As the first games used humans with supernatural abilities, for &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;, the designers decided to use monsters rather than humans as enemies. A notable boss battle was The End from &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; that was meant to differentiate it from all the other bosses in the franchise due to its strategic gameplay. Another common motif has been the transformation of a previously normal character returning as a ninja. It started with Kyle Schneider in &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; when he fought against Snake as &quot;Black Ninja&quot;. Several other characters have done the same, including Gray Fox, Olga Gurlukovich, and Raiden.

Much as &quot;Metal Gear&quot; began as partially a pastiche of action movies of the time, characters were sometimes pastiches of contemporary action movie heroes. &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; characters have been designed by Yoji Shinkawa. Several of their real names and aliases are references to various Hollywood films. Because of the time skip between games, a few of the characters have been redesigned to fit in the game&#x27;s year. With the improvements from new video game consoles like the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, the staff gave the characters a more realistic look although they initially had doubts about it. Kojima&#x27;s thoughts regarding Snake&#x27;s improved abilities by the time of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; led to the concept of cloned characters who would be able to match him in combat. By &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, Kojima was inspired by the Sherlock Holmes novels to introduce a sidekick character in order to view Snake from a different perspective.

==Development==
The first &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game was intended to be an action game that featured modern military combat. However, the MSX2&#x27;s hardware limited the number of on-screen bullets and enemies, which Hideo Kojima felt impeded the combat aspect. Inspired by &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, he altered the gameplay to focus on a prisoner escaping. In a series of articles written for &quot;Official PlayStation 2 Magazine&quot;, Hideo Kojima identified several Hollywood films as the primary sources of inspiration for the storylines and gameplay of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series. He further noted that the James Bond series is what influenced him the most regarding the creation of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. The original plot has references to the nuclear war paranoia during the mid-1980s that resulted from the Cold War. Following games would revolve around nuclear weapon inspections in Iraq and Iran, but this idea was left out due to growing concern regarding the political situation in the Middle East. Other changes to the series were made in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; as a result of the September 11 attacks.

After &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, Kojima planned to release the third &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game in 1994 for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in 1994. Besides changing the game&#x27;s platform to the PlayStation, the game was renamed, and its subsequent sequels were given the word &quot;Solid&quot; as the series started using 3D computer graphics. Since then, the games were designed to be more realistic to further entertain the players. &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; was initially meant to be made for the PlayStation 3, but due to the long wait for the console, the game was developed for the PlayStation 2 instead. As previous game&#x27;s settings were indoors areas due to difficulties with the consoles, since &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot;, Kojima wished to drastically change it despite difficulties. Since &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; had several plot points unresolved, it was originally meant to leave it to players to discuss them to come to their own conclusions. This has led to consistency issues in the English versions of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; as they mentioned plot elements that were further explored in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;.

===Printed adaptations===
A novel adaptation of the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; was published in 1988 as a part of Scholastic&#x27;s &quot;Worlds of Power&quot; line of novelizations, which were based on third-party NES games. It was written by Alexander Frost. The novelization is not based on the game&#x27;s official storyline, but rather on Konami of America&#x27;s localization of the plot. The book takes further liberties by giving Solid Snake the name of Justin Halley, and by changing the name of Snake&#x27;s unit from FOXHOUND to the &quot;Snake Men&quot;. In Japan, a &quot;Metal Gear&quot; gamebook was published on March 31, 1988, shortly after the release of the game on the Famicom. It is set two years after the events of the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and is part of the &quot;Konami Gamebook Series&quot;. A novelization of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was published in 2008. It was written by Raymond Benson, the author of nine James Bond novels. Benson also wrote a &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; novelization, which was published in 2009. Critical reaction to Benson&#x27;s novelizations has been generally positive, with Bookgasm.com writing that &quot;Benson does a fine job translating the game to the page&quot; with &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, and MishMashMagazine.com calling &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; &quot;a great companion to the game&quot;. A Japanese-language novelization of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; by Project Itoh was published on June 12, 2008. The novel was translated into English by Viz Media and was released on June 19, 2012.

A comic book adaptation of the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was published by IDW Publishing in 2004. It was written by Kris Oprisko and with illustrations by Ashley Wood. The series lasted 24 issues and has been collected in two trade paperbacks as well as a single hardback collector&#x27;s edition which is currently out-of-print. The entire run of the comic was collected again in a paperback book, &quot;Metal Gear Solid Omnibus,&quot; and released in June 2010. A comic book adaptation of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; has also been published by IDW, written by Alex Garner with illustrations by Ashley Wood. A digital version of the first comic book adaptation was released for the PlayStation Portable, &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel,&quot; in 2006. A second digital version, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Dessinée&quot;, was released exclusively in Japan as a DVD release in 2008 and features fully voiced versions of both comic book adaptations. All the Japanese voice actors from the games reprised their roles with the exception of those that have died.

===CDs===
A radio drama based on the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; aired in Japan from 1998 to 1999 as part of Konami&#x27;s syndicated &quot;CLUB db&quot; program. Directed by Shuyo Murata and written by Motosada Mori, the serial lasted over 12 weekly installments spanning three story arcs. The series was later collected as a two-volume set. The series serves as an alternate continuation to the events of Shadow Moses, with Solid Snake, Meryl Silverburgh, Mei Ling and Roy Campbell going on further missions as FOXHOUND operatives (Mei Ling and Meryl are depicted wearing a battle dress uniform and a sneaking suit respectively), although the stories are not considered part of the mainstream &quot;Metal Gear&quot; canon. The Japanese voice actors from the game reprised their roles for the series, while new characters are introduced as well.

Several promotional DVDs have been released detailing the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series. &quot;Metal Gear Saga vol. 1&quot; was released in 2006 as a pre-order disc for &quot;MGS3: Subsistence&quot;. It is divided into five chapters, each dealing with one game of the then five-part &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series in chronological order (beginning with &quot;MGS3&quot;), and each includes discussions by Hideo Kojima. &quot;Metal Gear Saga vol. 2&quot; was first shown at the 20th Metal Gear Anniversary Party, and then released as a pre-order disc for &quot;MGS4&quot;. In this, the video is presented as a pseudo-documentary about Solid Snake and is divided into a prologue and four chapters: Naked Snake-the birth of Snake (chronicling the events of &quot;MGS3&quot;, &quot;MG1&quot;, and &quot;MG2&quot;), Liquid Snake-the second snake (&quot;MGS&quot;), Solidus Snake-the third Snake (&quot;MGS2&quot;) and Solid Snake-the first Snake (setting the stage for &quot;MGS4&quot;).

===Toys===
In 1999, McFarlane Toys, with the collaboration of Konami, launched a series of action figures depicting key characters from &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. In 2001, following the success of the first series, and with the release of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty,&quot; McFarlane Toys, and Konami combined their efforts to produce a line of action figures depicting &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;&#x27;s main characters. Each character has a piece of Metal Gear RAY, so collecting the entire set is essential to build the robot.

Konami has also released 4&quot; scale blind-box figures based on &quot;MGS2&quot; released in Japan, &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Substance&quot; shortly after in 2003; the &quot;Substance&quot; series was eventually brought to the US and UK markets packaged on card rather than blind boxed. During the release of &quot;MGS3&quot;, Medicom released 12&quot; figures of Snake as part of their Real Action Heroes line. Medicom continued to support the franchise with the release of Kubrick figures for &quot;Snake Eater&quot; and &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot;, which also included seven- and 12-inch versions of the game&#x27;s characters.

In 2009, toy company ThreeA joined forces with Kojima to make related products. The first fruit of this partnership came in late 2012, when ThreeA released a massive 1/48 scale figure of Metal Gear REX, with working LED lights. It can also be dressed up to depict REX&#x27;s decrepit condition in &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot;. The company is also cooperating with graphic artist Ashley Wood to develop a similarly scaled Metal Gear RAY. A prototype was first unveiled at the ReVenture hobby show in Hong Kong in April 2012.

Square Enix also joined the production of toys based on the franchise starting with the boss vehicles and characters from &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;. The toys, which are from Square&#x27;s &quot;Play Arts Kai&quot; line, were released in 2010. The line has since expanded to include characters from &quot;Metal Gear Solid,&quot; &quot;Sons of Liberty,&quot; &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot;, and &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;, with the detail more pronounced than the original McFarlane Toys figures.

In 2012, Hot Toys released a 1/6th action figure of Naked Snake in his original sneaking suit attire from &quot;MGS3&quot;, as well as the Boss.

To celebrate the franchise&#x27;s 25th anniversary, model kit company Kotobukiya released a 1/100 scale Metal Gear REX, which features small figures of Solid Snake, Liquid Snake, and Gray Fox in both standing and near-death versions., and later followed suit with RAY. Kaiyodo&#x27;s Revoltech action figure line includes versions of Big Boss from &quot;Peace Walker&quot; and Raiden from &quot;Rising: Revengeance&quot;, plus Venom Snake and a generic Soviet Army soldier from &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; for the smaller RevoMini action figure category.

===Soundtracks===
Soundtracks for the first two games were produced by Iku Mizutani, Shigehiro Takenouchi, and Motoaki Furukawa. For &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Kojima wanted &quot;a full orchestra right next to the player&quot;; a system which made modifications such as tempo and texture to the currently playing track, instead of switching to another pre-recorded track. Although these features could not be achieved at that time, they were implemented in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;. Hideo Kojima&#x27;s choice of Harry Gregson-Williams, a Hollywood film composer from Hans Zimmer&#x27;s studio, as the composer for &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; was highly publicized in the run-up to the game&#x27;s release. Gregson-Williams would reprise his role in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;. Starting with &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, theme songs have been provided by popular artists such as Rika Muranaka. Several soundtracks based on the games have also been published.

===Film adaptation===
In May 2006, &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series creator Hideo Kojima announced that an English-language film adaptation of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was in early development. Kojima also announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo later that month that he had negotiated a contract with a party in Hollywood to adapt the video game into a film, though no further details were shared at that time. David Hayter, the English voice actor for Solid Snake, submitted a film treatment that executives passed on. Producers had expressed interest in &quot;Equilibrium&quot; director Kurt Wimmer as writer and/or director, or Paul Thomas Anderson to direct; Kojima also denied claims that German director Uwe Boll was a possible contender. Viggo Mortensen and Hugh Jackman were considered for the role of Snake, while Christian Bale denied rumors of his involvement. On January 11, 2010, producer Michael De Luca confirmed that work on a &quot;Metal Gear&quot; film adaptation had been postponed indefinitely. He said Konami expressed concern that the entire &quot;Metal Gear&quot; franchise could be seriously affected if a movie version performed poorly. In March 2012, during &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Kojima stated that he did not have a desire to write or direct a potential &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; movie himself.

At the Metal Gear 25th Anniversary on August 30, 2012, Hideo Kojima announced that Arad Productions, owned by Arad brothers Avi and Ari, had agreed to produce a movie version of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; with Columbia Pictures. Columbia&#x27;s parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment, will be in charge of distribution. On June 3, 2014, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Sony was in talks with Jordan Vogt-Roberts to direct the film; he was confirmed to be attached as director of the project in 2015. In February 2017, Vogt-Roberts said the filmmakers are working on the film&#x27;s script with Kojima. He has stated a desire for the film to receive an R rating, expressing a desire to make &quot;the riskier, balls-to-the-wall, Kojima-san version of it. [...] it&#x27;s a way to make the first great video game movie where it doesn&#x27;t matter that it&#x27;s based on a video game.&quot; Although Jay Basu was initially announced as screenwriter in 2015, Derek Connolly was hired to rewrite the script in November 2017. Connolly completed the first draft of the film&#x27;s screenplay in July 2018, and another draft in December 2019. In December 2020, it was announced that Oscar Isaac had been officially cast as Solid Snake following his having expressed interest in the role; a 2024 insider rumor suggests Isaac may have dropped out of the project. Updates have been minimal since 2020, with comments from Isaac in 2022 and Arad in 2024 indicating that the script was still in progress.

==Reception and legacy==
The &quot;Metal Gear&quot; franchise has sold over copies . By February 2007, the series had grossed more than (equivalent to between adjusted for inflation) from copies sold, in addition to having sold ancillary merchandise including strategy guides, action figures and 200,000 comic books. , the franchise has grossed about worldwide.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; sold copies worldwide, and is followed in sales by &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; with over copies sold, and then &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, each with over copies sold. According to Chart-Track, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; was the second fastest-selling PlayStation 3 game in the United Kingdom after &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;. &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; grossed on release day, higher than the combined opening day box office of the films &quot;&quot; and &quot;Jurassic World&quot;. The PlayStation Portable games were met with notably lower sales, but it has been analyzed that this was because of the low sales of the console when the games were released. &quot;Metal Gear Survive&quot;, the first &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game to be developed since series creator Hideo Kojima left Konami, sold only a fraction of the sales made by &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;.

The series as a whole (namely concerning the Kojima-directed titles) is often regarded as one of the most influential of all time and has received largely critical acclaim from critics and players. Most of the numbered installments are considered to be some of the greatest video games of all time. &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; currently possesses 95.09% on GameRankings and 96/100 on Metacritic, making it the highest-scoring game of the series to date. In 2002, IGN&#x27;s editors ranked &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; as the best PlayStation game ever. In &quot;Game Informer Magazine&quot;″s list of top 200 games of all time, &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; ranked at No. 50 on the list. &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; was also voted as the fifth greatest PlayStation game in a poll from &quot;PlayStation Official Magazine (UK)&quot;. &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; were featured in the Smithsonian American Art Museum&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; exhibition taking place from March 16 to September 30, 2012. Games have won multiple awards such as &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, which won the &quot;Excellence Award for Interactive Art&quot; by the Japan Media Arts Festival, and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, which was given the Game of the Year award by &quot;Game Informer&quot;.

&quot;Metal Gear&quot; was the first mainstream stealth game, with the player starting the game unarmed, and sold over a million copies in the United States. &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor and is considered one of the best 8-bit games of all time. &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear 2&quot; are credited with pioneering stealth mechanics. &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, which debuted at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, was the first 3D stealth game, and is credited with popularizing the stealth game genre, as well as the hiding-behind-cover mechanic. The series pioneered the integration of cinematic techniques into video games, especially &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; which Eurogamer considers the &quot;first modern video game&quot;.

Several boss fights have been praised for their variety and strategy required to beat them. The series is notorious for its fourth wall breaking scenes. The storyline has been commented to maintain &quot;rich characterization&quot; while touching on some controversial themes. Hideo Kojima&#x27;s ambitious script in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; has been praised, some calling it the first example of a postmodern video game, while others have argued that it anticipated concepts such as post-truth politics, fake news, echo chambers and alternative facts. The series&#x27; storytelling in general has received praise for being among &quot;the most fascinating science fiction stories in any medium&quot;. The series&#x27; cutscenes have often been praised for their graphics and the characters&#x27; stunt performances. Nevertheless, a common criticism has been the scenes&#x27; lengthiness, as well as some parts of the storyline. Raiden&#x27;s unexpected introduction as the main protagonist in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, due to his lack of appearances in the games&#x27; trailers and how he replaces fan-favorite character Solid Snake, has been deemed as one of the most controversial parts of the entire series. The series&#x27; audio has been acclaimed to the point of receiving awards for its use of sound and music.

The &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series inspired numerous video game developers. &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; and &quot;Far Cry 2&quot; designer Clint Hocking stated that every stealth-action game &quot;owes its existence to the success of &quot;Metal Gear&quot;&quot; and that, &quot;Without &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, there would be no stealth games.&quot; &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; producer Mathieu Ferland said &quot;&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was a huge inspiration for &quot;Splinter Cell&quot;&quot; and it &quot;was a pioneer for both the genre and the quality of directing&quot;. Silicon Knights founder Denis Dyack said &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;″s &quot;story, script, characters, voice acting, and cinemas&quot; were &quot;a landmark&quot; and &quot;guiding light to the future of videogames.&quot; &quot;Unreal&quot; and &quot;Gears of War&quot; creator Cliff Bleszinski cited the military themes and action gameplay of &quot;Metal Gear&quot; as a major influence on his work, and he named &quot;Gears of War&quot; in homage to &quot;Metal Gear&quot;. &quot;Tenchu&quot; creator Takuma Endo cited the early 2D &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games as an influence. &quot;&quot; creator Tom Leonard said &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;″s success convinced them that experimental stealth gameplay could be marketable and &quot;revitalized the team&quot; in &quot;the closing months of the project.&quot; Sumo Digital designer Emily Knox cited &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; as an early formative influence on their work. &quot;Crysis 2&quot; animator Luke Kelly said the game&#x27;s animations were inspired by &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;. Neil Druckmann cited the revelation of Raiden in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; as an influence on &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; (2020).

Beyond video games, filmmaker Jordan Peele cited the series as an inspiration, particularly &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;. Several critics have also drawn comparisons between the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series, especially &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; (2014).

<text>Queenborough is a town on the Isle of Sheppey in the Swale borough of Kent in South East England.

Queenborough is south of Sheerness. It grew as a port near the Thames Estuary at the westward entrance to the Swale where it joins the River Medway. It is in the Sittingbourne and Sheppey parliamentary constituency.

Queenborough Harbour offers moorings between the Thames and Medway. It is possible to land at Queenborough on any tide and there are boat builders and chandlers in the marina. Admiral Lord Nelson is reputed to have learned many of his seafaring skills in these waters, and also shared a house near the small harbour with his mistress, Lady Hamilton.

Queenborough today still reflects something of its original 18th-century seafaring history, from which period most of its more prominent buildings survive. The church is the sole surviving feature from the medieval period. The town was first represented by two members of parliament in 1572.

==History==

===Saxon===
In Saxon times, the settlement on the site was known as &quot;Cyningburh&quot;, &quot;king&#x27;s borough&quot;.

===Medieval and Tudor===
A fortress, called Sheppey Castle or Queenborough Castle, was built to guard the passage of ships along the Swale upon the command of King Edward III between 1361 and 1377, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War with France. It was built on the site of a much earlier, but smaller castle. Its unusual design – round and symmetrical – was described by historians Howard Colvin and R. Allen Brown as &quot;exemplifying the principles of cylindrical and concentric fortification carried to their logical conclusion with perfect symmetry&quot;. They also suggest that the design, which bore similarities to Henry VIII&#x27;s Device Forts of the 16th century, may have been designed to defend against and to make best use of gunpowder artillery. Queenborough was the only true concentric castle built in England. It regained importance in the 16th century under Thomas Cheney, when it is thought to have influenced the construction of nearby Deal Castle and Walmer Castle.

In those days north Kent was divided by open waters and marshes stretching inland. The safest navigation to the open sea was then the route from the Thames into the Yantlet Creek (separating the Isle of Grain from the rest of Hoo Peninsula), and thus into the Swale from the Medway estuary, around the leeward side of the Isle of Sheppey into the Wantsum Channel, navigating past the Isle of Thanet to Sandwich and only then into the open waters of the English Channel. It was thus an easily defensible planned-town centre for the wool trade.

King Edward III had the town renamed after his Queen, Philippa of Hainault, and conferred upon it the rights of a free borough, with a governing body of a mayor and two bailiffs. He granted Queenborough a charter in 1366 and two years later bestowed the duties of a royal borough upon it.

During this period, Queenborough, on the Isle of Sheppey, was an important town for the export of wool, a significant crown revenue. In 1368, the Wool Staple was transferred from Canterbury to Queenborough: Sandwich and Queenborough became the two centres in Kent for wool trading.

The castle was excavated in 2005 by Channel 4&#x27;s archaeology television programme &quot;Time Team&quot;.

The town was first represented by two members of parliament in 1572, one of its earlier MPs being explorer Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1580. Matthias Falconer of Brabant established the first copperas factory in England at Queenborough in 1579.

===17th century===
King Charles I had the town reincorporated under the title of the &quot;mayor, jurats, bailiffs and burgesses of Queenborough&quot;, during which time the population was chiefly employed in the local oyster fishery. However the fort having protected the Swale and Medway estuaries for 300 years was never in fact to realise its function as a garrison, and recorded no active military history. After being seized by Parliamentarians in 1650, after the Civil War, and being considered unsuitable for repair, being of &quot;no practical use&quot; it was demolished during the interregnum.
Not long after this, in 1667, the Dutch captured the new Sheerness fort (then under construction) and invaded Queenborough. The occupation lasted only a few days; though the Dutch caused widespread panic, they were unable to maintain their offensive, and withdrew having captured and burnt numerous other ships in the Thames and Medway. Following this raid on the Medway, much-needed attention was given to the improvement of the naval defences of the Medway, which at length helped strengthen the economy of Queenborough and Sheppey. Some 300 years later, in 1967, The Queenborough and Brielle (the Netherlands) twinning project was established.

Work began on overhauling the parish church in 1690.

===18th century===

The parish church overhaul continued through to 1730, and a number of houses added to the growing town during the 18th century. With the general prosperity of the colonial and mercantile trades of the age, Queenborough thrived. Queenborough Guildhall was completed in 1793.

With the silting up of the Yantlet creek and the Wantsum channel and improved navigation through the Thames estuary to London, Queenborough began to lose its importance, becoming something of a backwater. Daniel Defoe described it as &quot;a miserable and dirty fishing town (with) the chief traders ... alehouse keepers and oyster catchers&quot;.

The Royal Navy eventually became less prominent on the River Medway as other dockyards developed and ships grew in size, so that they were largely replaced by prison hulks which would frequently dispose of their dead charges on a salt marsh at the mouth of the Swale, which was subsequently to become known as Dead Man&#x27;s Island, and can still be found as such, on local maps today. The new fort and harbour developments completed at Sheerness by this time further replaced Queenborough by being better positioned at the mouth of the Medway.

===19th century to date===

Records from between 1815 and 1820 show that the Corporation of Queenborough was in some financial difficulties, owing some £14,500 that it could not hope to pay. It appears that the mayor and other officials had been less than honest in their duties toward the community, with the use of the public money at their disposal. This fraud caused a great financial burden upon the fishers and oyster catchers, who were driven to &quot;unlawful and riotous assembly&quot;, in protest against unwarranted charges made upon them in the course of their trade. So serious had this deterioration in conditions become, that by the middle of the 19th century the corporation was bankrupt. A leading figure was Thomas Young Greet, who frequently held the office of mayor, and treasurer, and first came to Queenborough in 1814. He and his friends used their positions to cream off the profits of the fisheries. Parliament was called upon to act, vesting by an act of Parliament much of the town&#x27;s business in the hands of trustees who were able to refinance the economy by selling land, property and the ancient oyster fishery. The oyster trade having been corrupted by smuggling and the bribery of the island&#x27;s members of parliament, the town lost its franchise in the Reform Act 1832.

The economy of Queenborough was boosted significantly by the establishment of a branch line from Sittingbourne by the Sittingbourne and Sheerness Railway (later part of the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway), which operated in conjunction with a mail and passenger service by steamer to Vlissingen in the Netherlands. The Swale was bridged when the railway was built in 1860.

From the town&#x27;s depression in the 1850s there began a process of recovery. New industries came to Queenborough including a glass works and a company engaged in coal washing. Besides these many other small industries developed, including potteries, the Fertilizer company (which used the old spelling of Sheppey) and the glue works. The Portland cement works opened in 1890, and there is still a considerable trade in timber.

A borough charter granted in 1885 gave some renewed impetus to the struggling borough council, but it was not until 1937 that the Charity Commissioners were at last able to appoint a borough council, but the town and its fisheries never fully recovered. The present trustees are Swale Borough Council, which incorporated the old borough council in the local government reorganisation of 1974. Queenborough now has a town council, which includes a mayor.

Unsightly modern sea wall defences have hindered the character of the beaches but were deemed necessary; a large yachting harbour exists, where the pirate radio ship &quot;Radio Caroline&quot; (in the river Medway 2003–04) anchored for a while. Tourism is today a major feature of the island, with Queenborough enjoying some of the fruits of local investment.

==Government==

Queenborough is in the parliamentary constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey. As of July 2024, the constituency&#x27;s member of parliament is Kevin McKenna of the Labour Party.

Queenborough is within the Swale local government district and its electoral ward of Queenborough and Halfway. This ward has three of the forty seven seats on Swale Borough Council. As of the 2019 local elections, all three seats are held by the Conservative Party.

Queenborough continues the traditions of having a town council and a mayor. The town council is made up of eleven elected members, seven from Queenborough and four from Rushenden. The current mayor is Councillor Richard Darby.

==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, the parish of Queenborough had a population of 3,471.

<text>A queen bee is typically an adult, mated female (gyne) that lives in a colony or hive of honey bees. With fully developed reproductive organs, the queen is usually the mother of most, if not all, of the bees in the beehive. Queens are developed from larvae selected by worker bees and specially fed in order to become sexually mature. There is normally only one adult, mated queen in a hive, in which case the bees will usually follow and fiercely protect her.

The term &quot;queen bee&quot; can be more generally applied to any dominant reproductive female in a colony of a eusocial bee species other than honey bees. However, as in the Brazilian stingless bee (&quot;Schwarziana quadripunctata&quot;), a single nest may have multiple queens or even dwarf queens, ready to replace a dominant queen in case of a sudden death.

==Development==

During the warm parts of the year, female &quot;worker&quot; bees leave the hive every day to collect nectar and pollen. While male bees serve no architectural or pollinating purpose, their primary function (if they are healthy enough) is to mate with a queen bee. If they are successful, they fall to the ground and die after copulation. Any fertilized egg has the potential to become a queen. Diet in the larval stage determines whether the bee will develop into a queen or a worker. Queens are fed only royal jelly, a protein-rich secretion from glands on the heads of young workers. Worker larvae are fed bee bread which is a mixture of nectar and pollen. All bee larvae are fed some royal jelly for the first few days after hatching but only queen larvae are fed the jelly exclusively. As a result of the difference in diet, the queen will develop into a sexually mature female, unlike the worker bees.

Queens are raised in specially constructed queen cells. The fully constructed queen cells have a peanut-like shape and texture.
Queen cells start out as queen cups, which are larger than the cells of normal brood comb and are oriented vertically instead of horizontally. Worker bees will only further build up the queen cup once the queen has laid an egg in a queen cup. In general, the old queen starts laying eggs into queen cups when conditions are right for swarming or supersedure. Swarm cells hang from the bottom of a frame while supersedure queens or emergency queens are generally raised in cells built out from the face of a frame.

As the young queen larva pupates with her head down, the workers cap the queen cell with beeswax. When ready to emerge, the virgin queen will chew a circular cut around the cap of her cell. Often the cap swings open when most of the cut is made, so as to appear like a hinged lid.

During swarming season, the old queen is likely to leave with the prime swarm before the first virgin queen emerges from a queen cell.

==Virgin queen bee==

A virgin queen is a queen bee that has not mated with a drone. Virgins are intermediate in size between workers and mated, laying queens, and are much more active than the latter. They are hard to spot while inspecting a frame, because they run across the comb, climbing over worker bees if necessary, and may even take flight if sufficiently disturbed. Virgin queens can often be found clinging to the walls or corners of a hive during inspections.

Virgin queens appear to have little queen pheromone and often do not appear to be recognized as queens by the workers. A virgin queen in her first few hours after emergence can be placed into the entrance of any queenless hive or nuc and acceptance is usually very good, whereas a mated queen is usually recognized as a stranger and runs a high risk of being killed by the older workers.

When a young virgin queen emerges from a queen cell, she will generally seek out virgin queen rivals and attempt to kill them. Virgin queens will quickly find and kill (by stinging) any other emerged virgin queen (or be dispatched themselves), as well as any unemerged queens. Queen cells that are opened on the side indicate that a virgin queen was likely killed by a rival virgin queen. When a colony remains in swarm mode after the prime swarm has left, the workers may prevent virgins from fighting and one or several virgins may go with after-swarms. Other virgins may stay behind with the remnant of the hive. Some virgins have been seen to escape the hive to avoid being killed and seek out another without a queen, such as in the eusocial bee &quot;Melipona scutellaris.&quot; This can contain multiple virgin queens. When the after-swarm settles into a new home, the virgins will then resume normal behavior and fight to the death until only one remains. 
If the prime swarm has a virgin queen and an old queen, the old queen will usually be allowed to live. The old queen continues laying. Within a couple of weeks she will die a natural death and the former virgin, now mated, will take her place.

Unlike the worker bees, the queen&#x27;s stinger is not barbed and she is able to sting repeatedly without dying.

===Piping===

Piping () is a noise made by virgin and mated queen bees during certain times of the virgin queens&#x27; development. Fully developed virgin queens communicate through vibratory signals: &quot;quacking&quot; from virgin queens in their queen cells and &quot;tooting&quot; from queens free in the colony, collectively known as piping. A virgin queen may frequently pipe before she emerges from her cell and for a brief time afterwards. Mated queens may briefly pipe after being released in a hive.

Piping is most common when there is more than one queen in a hive. It is postulated that the piping is a form of battle cry announcing to competing queens and show the workers their willingness to fight. It may also be a signal to the worker bees which queen is the most worthwhile to support.

The adult queen pipes for a two-second pulse followed by a series of quarter-second toots. The queens of African bees produce more vigorous and frequent bouts of piping.

==Reproduction cycle==
The surviving virgin queen will fly out on a sunny, warm day to a drone congregation area where she will mate with 12–15 drones. If the weather holds, she may return to the drone congregation area for several days until she is fully mated. Mating occurs in flight. The young queen stores up to 6 million sperm from multiple drones in her spermatheca. She will selectively release sperm for the remaining 2–7 years of her life.

The young virgin queen has a limited time to mate. If she is unable to fly for several days because of bad weather and remains unmated, she will become a &quot;drone layer.&quot; Drone-laying queens usually signal the death of the colony, because the workers have no fertilized (female) larvae from which to raise worker bees or a replacement queen.

Though timing can vary, matings usually take place between the sixth and tenth day after the queen emerges. Egg laying usually begins 2 to 3 days after the queen returns to the beehive, but can start earlier than this.

A special, rare case of reproduction is thelytoky: the reproduction of female workers or queens by laying worker bees by parthenogenesis. Thelytoky occurs in the Cape bee, &quot;Apis mellifera capensis&quot;, and has been found in other strains at very low frequency.

===Supersedure===

As the queen ages, her pheromone output diminishes. A queen bee that becomes old, or is diseased or failing, is replaced by the workers in a procedure known as &quot;supersedure&quot;.

Supersedure may be forced by a beekeeper, for example by clipping off one of the queen&#x27;s middle or posterior legs. This makes her unable to properly place her eggs at the bottom of the brood cell; the workers detect this and then rear replacement queens. When a new queen becomes available, the workers kill the reigning queen by &quot;balling&quot; her, clustering tightly around her. Death through balling is accomplished by surrounding the queen and raising her body temperature, causing her to overheat and die. Balling is often a problem for beekeepers attempting to introduce a replacement queen.

If a queen suddenly dies, the workers will attempt to create an &quot;emergency queen&quot; by selecting several brood cells where a larva has just emerged which are then flooded with royal jelly. The worker bees then build larger queen cells over the normal-sized worker cells which protrude vertically from the face of the brood comb. Emergency queens are usually smaller and less prolific than normal queens.

==Daily life==

The primary function of a queen bee is to serve as the reproducer. A well-mated and well-fed queen of quality stock can lay about 1,500 eggs per day during the spring build-up—more than her own body weight in eggs every day. She is continuously surrounded by worker bees who meet her every need, giving her food and disposing of her waste. The attendant workers also collect and then distribute queen mandibular pheromone, a pheromone that inhibits the workers from starting queen cells.

The queen bee is able to control the sex of the eggs she lays. The queen lays a fertilized (female) or unfertilized (male) egg according to the width of the cell. Drones are raised in cells that are significantly larger than the cells used for workers. The queen fertilizes the egg by selectively releasing sperm from her spermatheca as the egg passes through her oviduct.

==Identification==
The queen bee&#x27;s abdomen is longer than the worker bees surrounding her and also longer than a male bee&#x27;s. Even so, in a hive of 60,000 to 80,000 honey bees, it is often difficult for beekeepers to find the queen with any speed; for this reason, many queens in non-feral colonies are marked with a light daub of paint on their thorax. The paint usually does not harm the queen and makes her easier to find when necessary.

Although the color is sometimes randomly chosen, professional queen breeders use a color that identifies the year a queen hatched, which helps them to decide whether their queens are too old to maintain a strong hive and need to be replaced. The mnemonic taught to assist beekeepers in remembering the colour order is Will You Raise Good Bees (white, yellow, red, green, blue).

Sometimes tiny convex disks marked with identification numbers (&quot;Opalithplättchen&quot;) are used when a beekeeper has many queens born in the same yeara method that can also be used to keep multiple bees in the same hive under observation for research purposes.

==Queen rearing==
Queen rearing is the process by which beekeepers raise queen bees from young fertilized worker bee larvae. The most commonly used method is known as the Doolittle method. In the Doolittle method, the beekeeper grafts larvae, which are 24 hours or less of age, into a bar of queen cell cups. The queen cell cups are placed inside of a cell-building colony. A cell-building colony is a strong, well-fed, queenless colony that feeds the larva royal jelly and develops the larvae into queen bees.

After approximately 10 days, the queen cells are transferred from the cell building colony to small mating nuclei colonies, which are placed inside of mating yards. The queens emerge from their cells inside of the mating nuclei. After approximately 7–10 days, the virgin queens take their mating flights, mate with 10–20 drone bees, and return to their mating nuclei as mated queen bees.

Queen rearing can be practiced on a small scale by hobbyist or sideline beekeepers raising a small number of queens for their own use, or can be practiced on a larger, commercial scale by companies that produce queen bees for sale to the public. As of 2017, the cost of a queen honeybee ranges from $25 to $32.

Beekeepers can also utilize alternative methods of queen rearing. Examples are the Jenter kit, walk-away split, Cloake board, and artificial insemination.

<text>Education in Japan is managed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan. Education is compulsory at the elementary and lower secondary levels, for total of nine years.

The contemporary Japanese education system is a product of historical reforms dating back to the Meiji period, which established modern educational institutions and systems. This early start of modernisation enabled Japan to provide education at all levels in the native language (Japanese), rather than using the languages of powerful countries that could have had a strong influence in the region. Current educational policies focus on promoting lifelong learning, advanced professional education, and internationalising higher education through initiatives such as accepting more international students, as the nation has a rapidly ageing and shrinking population.

Japanese students consistently achieve high rankings in reading, mathematics, and sciences according to OECD evaluations. In the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Japan ranked eighth globally, with an average score of 520 compared to the OECD average of 488. Despite this relatively high performance, Japan’s spending on education as a percentage of GDP is 4.1%, below the OECD average of 5%. However, the expenditure per student is relatively high. As of 2023, around 65% of Japanese aged 25 to 34 have attained some form of tertiary education, with a significant number holding degrees in science and engineering, fields crucial to Japan’s technology-driven economy. Japanese women surpass men in higher education attainment, with 59% holding university degrees compared to 52% of men. MEXT reports that 80.6% of 18-year-olds pursue higher education, with a majority attending universities.

==History==

Formal education in Japan began in the 6th century AD with the adoption of Chinese culture. Buddhist and Confucian teachings, along with sciences, calligraphy, divination, and Japanese and Chinese literature, were taught at the courts of Asuka (538-710), Nara (710-794), and Heian (794-1185). Unlike in China, Japan did not fully implement an meritocratic examination system for court positions, and these positions remained largely hereditary. The Kamakura period saw the rise of the bushi (or samurai, the military class) and decline in the influence of the traditional cultured court nobility (kuge), which also reduced the influence of scholar officials based in Kyoto, as samurai spread across the country. However, Buddhist monasteries continued to be significant centres of learning.

In the Edo period, the Yushima Seidō in Edo (modern-day Tokyo) became the chief educational institution. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the daimyō vied for power in the largely pacified country. Since their influence could not be raised through war, they competed in the economic field. Their warrior-turned-bureaucrat Samurai elite had to be educated not only in military strategy and the martial arts but also in literature, agriculture and accounting. Samurai schools, known as hankō, educated samurai and their children, instilling Confucian values and military skills. Merchants also sought education for business purposes, leading to the establishment of terakoya, which taught basic reading, writing, and arithmetic. Despite limited contact with foreign countries (sakoku), books from China and Europe were imported, and &quot;Rangaku&quot; (“Dutch studies”) became popular, especially in the field of natural sciences. By the end of the Edo period, literacy rates had significantly increased, with about 50% of men and 20% of women being literate. &#x27;Commoners&#x27; would also form communal gatherings to try to educate themselves with the help of a scholar. One such, Baigan Ishida, was a great orator and writer who reached the merchant class. There were wakashu-gumi, or youth groups, that consisted of young men ages fourteen to seventeen, who at these groups learned about ceremonies, cooperative living, language, manners, marriage, straw weaving, and world information, not to mention talking and singing. Japan was thriving with the want for enlightenment.

===Meiji Restoration===

After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, the methods and structures of Western learning were adopted as a means to make Japan a strong, modern nation. Students and even high-ranking government officials were sent abroad to study, such as the Iwakura mission. Compulsory education was introduced, primarily modelled after the Prussian model. In 1877, the nation&#x27;s first university, the University of Tokyo was established by merging Edo-era institutions and schools, including the aforementioned Yushima Seidō. Foreign scholars, the so-called &quot;o-yatoi gaikokujin&quot;, were invited to teach at this newly founded university and military academies. These scholars were gradually replaced by Japanese scholars who had been educated at this university or abroad. In 1897, Kyoto Imperial University was established as the country&#x27;s second university, which was followed by other imperial universities and private universities such as Keio and Waseda after the 1920s.

In the 1890s, Japan saw a rise in reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and educated mothers who embraced new ideas about childhood and education. They introduced the upper middle class to a concept of childhood that involved children having their own space, reading children&#x27;s books, playing with educational toys, and spending significant time on school homework. These concepts quickly spread across all social classes. The Meiji government established the nation&#x27;s first modern public library in 1872, which is regarded as the origin of today&#x27;s National Diet Library.

===Post-WWII===
After Japan’s defeat in the Second World War, the Allied occupation introduced educational reforms, officially to promote democracy and pacifism. The reforms aimed to decentralise education, reduce state control, weaken the class structure and encourage teacher initiative. The Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law, both enacted in 1947, laid the foundation for a new education system modelled after the American system, with six years of elementary, three years of lower secondary, three years of upper secondary, and four years of university education. Compulsory education was extended to nine years, and coeducation became more common.

After the occupation period ended in 1951, Japan’s education system continued to evolve. The 1950s saw efforts to re-centralise some aspects of education, including curriculum and textbook standards, under the Ministry of Education. Moral education was reintroduced, and measures were taken to standardise teacher performance and administration. During the 1960s and 1970s, Japan experienced rapid economic growth and became the second largest economy in the world, which impacted its education system. The government invested heavily in education to support industrial development and technological advancement. This period saw a significant increase in the number of universities and vocational schools to meet the demands of a growing economy. University admissions became intensely selective and competitive during this period.

By the 1980s, Japan’s education system faced new challenges. The pressure of entrance examinations and the intense competition for university places led to significant stress among students. In response, the government implemented several reforms aimed at reducing the academic burden and promoting a more holistic education (Yutori education). These included curriculum revisions, the introduction of more creative and critical thinking subjects, and a greater emphasis on moral and character education. This policy caused major concerns that academic skills for Japanese students may have declined from the mid-1990s, and after gradual changes, it was abolished completely by 2011. Japanese students showed a significant improvement in math and science scores in the 2011, compared to in 2007, according to the TIMSS survey.

== Organization of the school system ==

==School levels==
The academic year in Japan begins in April. Classes are normally held from Monday to Friday. At the primary and secondary level, the school year consists of two or three terms, which are separated by short holidays in spring and winter, and a six-week-long summer break. Universities typically have two semesters, with the second starting from September or October, incorporating a new year break towards the end of the semester.

The year structure is summarized below:
===Secondary school===

====Lower secondary school====
The lower secondary school covers grades seven through nine, with children typically aged twelve through fifteen. There are 3.2 million primary school students in Japan as of 2023, down from over 5.3 million in 1991. However, the number of junior high schools has remained relatively static, falling from 11,275 in 1993 to 9,944 in 2023. The number of junior high school teachers has also changed little, with 257,605 junior high school teachers in 1996, and 247,485 in 2023. Approximately 8% of junior high students attend private junior high schools (accounting for 7% of all junior high schools by number). Private schools are considerably more expensive: as of 2013, the average annual cost of private primary school attendance was ¥1,295,156 per student, roughly thrice the ¥450,340 cost for a public school. Japan&#x27;s compulsory education ends at grade nine, but less than 2% drop out; 60% of students advanced to senior education as of 1960, increasing rapidly to over 90% by 1980, rising further each year until reaching 98.3% as of 2012.

Instruction in primary schools is often in the form of lectures. Teachers also use other Media, such as television and Radio, and there is some laboratory work. By 1989 about 45% of all public primary schools had computers, including schools that used them only for administrative purposes. All course contents are specified in the Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools. Some subjects, such as Japanese language and mathematics, are coordinated with the elementary curriculum. Others, such as foreign-language study, begin at this level, though from April 2011, English became a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum. The junior school curriculum covers Japanese language, social studies, mathematics, science, music, fine arts, health, and physical education. All students are also exposed to industrial arts and homemaking. Moral education and special activities continue to receive attention.

The ministry recognizes a need to improve the teaching of all foreign languages, especially English. To improve instruction in spoken English, the government invites many young native speakers of English to Japan to serve as assistants to school boards and prefectures under its Japan Exchange and Teaching Programme (JET). Beginning with 848 participants in 1987, the program grew to a high of 6,273 participants in 2002. Today, the program is again growing due to English becoming a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum in 2011. As of July 2023, 5,831 language teachers are hired through the JET programme, most of them coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. The total number of foreign nationals hired as language teachers is 20,249 as of 2021.

====Upper secondary school====

Though upper-secondary school is not compulsory in Japan, 98.8% of all junior high school graduates enrolled as of 2020. Upper secondary consists of three years. Private upper-secondary schools account for about 55% of all upper-secondary schools. Beginning in 2010, public high schools do not collect tuition fees any more, while private and national high schools are free in certain prefectures including Tokyo.

The most common type of upper-secondary school has a full-time, general program that offers academic courses for students preparing for higher education as well as technical and vocational courses for students expecting to find employment after graduation. A small number of schools offer part-time programs, evening courses, or correspondence education.

The first-year programs for students in both academic and commercial courses are similar. They include basic academic courses, such as Japanese language, English, mathematics, and science. In upper-secondary school, differences in ability are first publicly acknowledged, and course content and course selection are far more individualized in the second year. However, there is a core of academic material throughout all programs.

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student&#x27;s disability, but the options are limited for some. The government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more students with disabilities.

===Higher and tertiary education===

Higher and tertiary education in Japan is provided in universities (daigaku), junior colleges (tanki daigaku), colleges of technology (koto senmon gakko), and special training colleges (senmon gakko). Of these four types of institutions, only universities and junior colleges are strictly considered as higher education.

As of 2017, more than 2.89 million students were enrolled in 780 universities. At the top of the higher education structure, these institutions provide a four-year training leading to a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and some offer six-year programs leading to a professional degree. There are two types of public four-year universities: the 86 national universities (including the Open University of Japan) and the 95 local public universities, founded by prefectures and municipalities. The 597 remaining four-year colleges in 2010 were private. With a wealth of opportunities for students wishing to pursue tertiary education, the nation&#x27;s prestigious schools are the most appealing for students seeking top employment prospects. The University of Tokyo and Kyoto University, the nation&#x27;s oldest universities, are the most prestigious and selective. In terms of international recognition, there are 49 Japanese universities listed on the &quot; QS World University Rankings 2025&quot;, with the University of Tokyo ranked 32nd and Kyoto University 50th. 

Most university and college students attend full-time day programs. In 1990 the most popular courses, enrolling almost 40 percent of all undergraduate students, were in the social sciences, including business, law, and accounting. Other popular fields were engineering (19 percent), the humanities (15 percent), and education (7 percent).

The average costs (tuition, fees, and living expenses) for a year of higher education in 1986 were ¥1.4 million. Some students work part-time or take out loans through the government-supported Japan Scholarship Association, local governments, non-profit corporations, and other institutions.

== School subjects at the secondary level ==
The following is the set of compulsory subjects currently taught in the Japanese education system from the primary to secondary levels:

* Japanese (the national language) 
* Arithmetic, mathematics, etc.
* Science, technology, etc.
* Foreign languages: English (rarely: Korean, Spanish, Arabic, French, German, or Chinese)
* Social studies (history, geography, and civics).
* Physical education (health, sports, etc.)
* Moral education (usually taught at the primary school level).
* Informatics, information technology, etc.
* Home economics, etc.

In Japanese elementary, junior, and senior secondary schools, textbooks that have passed the certification process from the Ministry of Education (MEXT) must be used.

== Academic grading ==
Japanese schools tend to follow different academic grading principles. Many universities use the following for assessment scores and marks:
=== Primary school levels ===
Elementary school students (years 1 through 6) are expected to complete their compulsory primary school education (義務教育, &quot;gimu kyoiku&quot;) as well as pass the admissions examinations for junior high schools.

=== Secondary school levels ===
For students to enter the secondary school level, students are required to sit for and pass the admissions examinations set by the schools. Failure indicates that students cannot proceed to secondary school.

Secondary education in Japan is difficult because it rigorously prepares students for university entrance. Many parents often send children to private cram schools known as &quot;juku&quot; (塾) to help prepare them for university entrance examinations such as the National University Entrance Qualification Examination (大学入試共通テスト). Classes for &quot;juku&quot; are typically held in the evenings after students have completed their regular day courses.

Most secondary schools in Japan have a numerical grading system from 5 to 1 with 5 being the highest score.

===Government intervention===
Under the Basic Act on Education (2007) Japan has signed to provide equal opportunity in education including individuals with disabilities. Along with the Basic Act on Education, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) was passed in 200 and was ratified in 2014 as part of welfare. These two acts promised that the national and local governments would provide special needs education programs with adequate accommodation according to their level of disability. The purpose of the Special Needs Education is to help individuals develop their potential under their capabilities to gain independence and to gain vocational training in special fields. Some schools accommodate students with a disability under traditional school settings, but in certain cases, students are placed in independent schools specialized in the special needs education program. This program supports students with visual impairment, hearing impairment, physical disability, emotional behavioral disorder, learning disabilities, speech-language impairment (communication disorder), health impairment and development delay. 
===Reforms===

Children with disabilities, along with their parents, did not have a voice until the 1990s when special needs education started to receive public attention. Before then, children with disabilities were deemed &quot;slow learners&quot; or &quot;difficult to blend in&quot;. The education department of the Japanese government slowly started to focus on giving equal rights to children with disabilities, and the first major reform began as an introduction of a &quot;Resource Room System&quot;, which served as a supplemental special need program for students with disabilities attending traditional school settings. In 2006, a greater educational reform took place to promote the notion of &quot;inclusive education&quot;. This inclusive education program came into being due to the influence of three political factors: the international movement for school inclusion, the reform of welfare for people with disabilities, and a general reform of the education system in Japan. The purpose of this act was to avoid isolation of students with disabilities with the rest of the mainstream society and integrate special need education with traditional education system by providing a more universal and diverse classroom setting. In recent years, the Japanese government continues to pass equal rights to children with disabilities under special need education and inclusive education as public welfare.

== Extracurricular activities ==
The Japanese educational system is supplemented by a heavy emphasis on extracurricular activities, also known as shadow education, which are any educational activities that do not take place during formal schooling. This is largely motivated by the extreme weight that is placed upon formal examinations as a prerequisite to attend university, something that is seen as integral to their future career and social status to gain a competitive edge, Japanese families are willing to expend money and have their child put in time and effort into a supplementary education. Forms of shadow education include &quot;mogi shiken&quot;, which are practice exams given by private companies that determine the child&#x27;s chances of getting into a university. &quot;Juku&quot; are private after-school classes that aim to develop abilities for students to excel in formal school curricula or to prepare for university examinations. &quot;Ronin&quot; are students who undergo full-time preparation for university exams following high school due to their inability to get into their school of choice.

Over 86% of students with college plans participate in at least one form of shadow education, with 60% participating in two or more.

==Criticisms==

Japanese students are faced with immense pressure to succeed academically from their parents, teachers, peers, and society. This is largely a result of a society that has long placed a great amount of importance on education, and a system that places all of its weight upon a single examination that has significant life-long consequences. This pressure has led to behaviors such as school violence, cheating, suicide, and significant psychological harm. In some cases, students have experienced nervous breakdowns that have required hospitalization as young as twelve. In 1991, it was reported that 1,333 people in the age group of 15–24 had killed themselves, much of which was due to academic pressure. In an international perspective, teenage suicide rates are close to the OECD average and below those of the United States. A survey by the Education Ministry showed that students at public schools were involved in a record number of violent incidents in 2007: 52,756 cases, an increase of some 8,000 on the previous year. In almost 7,000 of these incidents, teachers were the target of assault.

The Japanese educational system has also been criticized for failure to foster independent thinkers with cultural and artistic sensibility. Japanese students who attend schools overseas often face difficulty adapting and competing in that environment due to a lack of international viewpoints.

There is also criticism about the amount of free time students are given and/or are allowed within their middle school and high school careers. As Japanese students grow, their time to assert what they have learned in class to real life is cut dramatically, starting with the elevation from elementary to lower secondary school. A large part of this has to do with cram schooling, or Juku, which can start as early as elementary and takes full effect toward the end of junior high school, with roughly 60% of all students participating. This number has increased drastically over the past couple decades, as well as the view of Juku within the Japanese academic system. While initially seen as a problem, cram schools have become synonymous with Japan&#x27;s schooling and are even seen as a support to the structure of said schooling. With Juku costing between 600,000 and 1.5 million yen, depending on how old the student is and how much the guardian can pay, cram school is a very profitable part of the economy, with over 48,000 Juku schools active today. With these extra school sessions ranging between 1 and 6 days a week on top of normal classes, there is a fear that students will be unable to incorporate what they have learned into their lives, and thus could foreseeably lose the retained knowledge once the Entrance Exams are over. According to data from OECD&#x27;s PISA 2015, after-school study time was the 4th lowest among 55 surveyed countries, behind Germany, Finland, and Switzerland.

===Bullying===
There is criticism about insufficient efforts to reduce bullying in schools. In fiscal 2019, there were a record 612,496 bullying cases in schools across Japan. This includes public and, private elementary, junior high, high school, ls, and special schools for children with disabilities. Serious incidents with severe physical or psychological damage were 723 (a 20% increase from 2018). Bullying happens mostly in elementary schools (484,545 cases in 2019) followed by junior high schools (106,524 cases in 2019) and high schools (18,352 cases in 2019). In fiscal 2019, 317 students died from suicide of which 10 suffered from bullying. 61.9 percent of cases were verbal bullying and online bullying accounted for 18.9 percent in high schools. In 2019 there were 78,787 cases of violent acts by students in elementary, junior high, and high schools. Separate data from TIMSS 2019 and PISA 2018 indicate a lower than average incidence of bullying in international comparisons.

==International education==

As of 2016, Japan has 30 to 40 international schools.

<text>A scrivener (or scribe) was a person who, before the advent of compulsory education, could read and write or who wrote letters as well as court and legal documents. Scriveners were people who made their living by writing or copying written material. This usually indicated secretarial and administrative duties such as dictation and keeping business, judicial, and historical records for kings, nobles, temples, and cities. Scriveners later developed into notaries, court reporters, and in England and Wales, scrivener notaries.

They were and are generally distinguished from scribes, who in the European Middle Ages mostly copied books; with the spread of printing this role largely disappeared, but scriveners were still required. Styles of handwriting used by scriveners included secretary hand, book hand and court hand. 

==Current role==
Scriveners remain common mainly in countries where literacy rates remain low, for example India; they read letters for illiterate customers, as well as write letters or fill out forms for a fee. Many now use portable typewriters to prepare letters for their clients. In areas with very high literacy rates, they are far less common; however, social services organizations, libraries, and the like sometimes offer assistance to service users with low literacy skills to help them fill out forms, draft official correspondence, and the like.

Despite the high literacy rate, in France, &quot;public writers&quot; (&quot;écrivains publics&quot;) are still common. Their job mainly consists of composing formal writings like curricula vitae or motivation letters for people who do not write well, as well as other things like advertisements, or ghostwriting books. In French-speaking Belgium their return dates from 1999, in an effort to curb semi-literacy and broader socio-cultural inequality; they also include services like reading out loud.

==Etymology==
The word comes from Middle English , an alteration of obsolete , from Anglo-French , ultimately from Vulgar Latin , itself an alteration of Latin (scribe).

In Japan, the word &quot;scrivener&quot; is used as the standard translation of , in referring to legal professions such as judicial scriveners and administrative scriveners.

In the Irish language, a is a writer, or a person who writes. Similarly, in Welsh, is &#x27;to write&#x27;, is &#x27;writer&#x27; and is &#x27;secretary, scribe&#x27;.

==In literature==
A famous work of fiction featuring scriveners is the short story &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot; by Herman Melville, first published in 1853.

==Scrivener notaries==
In England and Wales, a scrivener notary is a notary who is fluent in multiple languages.

Scrivener notary tasks generally include authentication and drafting of legal documents for use in international contexts.
==Doctrine of &quot;scrivener&#x27;s error&quot;==

The doctrine of a &quot;scrivener&#x27;s error&quot; is the legal principle that a map-drafting or typographical error in a written contract may be corrected by oral evidence if the evidence is clear, convincing, and precise. If such correction (called scrivener&#x27;s amendment) affects property rights then it must be approved by those affected by it.

It is a mistake made while copying or transmitting legal documents, as distinguished from a judgment error, which is an error made in the exercise of judgment or discretion, or a technical error, which is an error in interpreting a law, regulation, or principle.
There is a considerable body of case law concerning the proper treatment of a scrivener&#x27;s error. For example, where the parties to a contract make an oral agreement that, when reduced to a writing, is mis-transcribed, the aggrieved party is entitled to reformation so that the writing corresponds to the oral agreement.

A scrivener&#x27;s error can be grounds for an appellate court to remand a decision back to the trial court. For example, in &quot;Ortiz v. State of Florida&quot;, Ortiz had been convicted of possession of less than 20g of marijuana, a misdemeanor. However, Ortiz was mistakenly adjudicated guilty of a felony for the count of marijuana possession. The appellate court held that &quot;we must remand the case to the trial court to correct a scrivener&#x27;s error.&quot;

In some circumstances, courts can also correct scrivener&#x27;s errors found in primary legislation.

<text>Education in France is organized in a highly centralized manner, with many subdivisions. It is divided into the three stages of primary education (&quot;enseignement primaire&quot;), secondary education (&quot;enseignement secondaire&quot;), and higher education (&quot;enseignement supérieur&quot;). Two year olds do not start primary school, they start preschool. Then, by the age of six, a child in France starts primary school and soon moves into higher and higher grade levels until they graduate.

In French higher education, the following degrees are recognized by the Bologna Process (EU recognition): &quot;Licence&quot; and &quot;Licence Professionnelle&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degrees), and the comparably named &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Doctorat&quot; degrees.

The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD in 2018 ranked the overall knowledge and skills of French 15-year-olds as 26th in the world in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, below the OECD average of 493. The average OECD performance of French 15-year-olds in science and mathematics has declined, with the share of low performers in reading, mathematics and science developing a sharp upward trend. France&#x27;s share of top performers in mathematics and science has also declined.

France&#x27;s performance in mathematics and science at the middle school level was ranked 23 in the 1995 Trends in International Math and Science Study. In 2019, France ranked 21 in the TIMSS Science general ranking.

==History==
Napoleon began the French university and secondary educational systems. Guizot started the elementary system. Intense battles took place over whether the Catholic Church should play a dominant role. The modern era of French education begins at the end of the 19th century. Jules Ferry, the Minister of Public Instruction in 1881, is widely credited for creating the modern school (&quot;l&#x27;école républicaine&quot;) by requiring all children between the ages of 6 and 12, both boys and girls, to attend. He also made public instruction mandatory, free of charge, and secular (&quot;laïque&quot;). With those laws, known as French Lubbers, Jules Ferry laws, and several others, the Third Republic repealed most of the Falloux Laws of 1850–1851, which gave an important role to the clergy.

The French curriculum predominantly emphasized the works of French writers of European descent. Ferry and others considered literature the glue of French identity. The ethnic and cultural demographics of the student body did not factor in to the quest to transmit a &quot;common culture&quot; to the students.

Like literature, history education is seen as critical to shaping the identity of young people and the integration of immigrants to French identity. Ferry&#x27;s views continue to exert influence today. Ministry reports have confirmed that the rule of schools in promoting &quot;common culture&quot; is only made more critical by the rising levels of student diversity. According to the ministry, history education in France has, over the course of one century made possible &quot;the integration of children of Italians, Poles, Africans and Portuguese&quot;.

==Governance==

All educational programmes in France are regulated by the Ministry of National Education and Youth (officially called &quot;Ministère de l&#x27;Éducation nationale et de la Jeunesse&quot;). The head of the ministry is the Minister of National Education.

All teachers in public primary and secondary schools are state civil servants, making the &quot;ministère&quot; the largest employer in the country. Professors and researchers in France&#x27;s universities are also employed by the state.

At the primary and secondary levels, the curriculum is the same for all French students in any given grade, which includes public, semi-public and subsidised institutions. However, there exist specialised sections and a variety of options that students can choose. The reference for all French educators is the &quot;Bulletin officiel de l&#x27;éducation nationale, de l&#x27;enseignement supérieur et de la recherche (B.O.)&quot;, which lists all current programmes and teaching directives. It is amended multiple times each year.

Since 2021, schooling is mandatory and families may only provide teaching outside of a school in exceptional circumstances:
* Long-term illness,
* Intensive athletic or artistic activities,
* Distance from a public school,
* Or other specific reasons.

==School year==

In Metropolitan France, the school year runs from early September to early July. The school calendar is standardized throughout the country and is the sole domain of the ministry.

In May, schools need time to organize exams (for example, the ). Outside Metropolitan France, the school calendar is set by the local &quot;recteur&quot;.

Major holiday breaks are as follows:
*All Saints (&quot;la Toussaint&quot;), two weeks (since 2012) around the end of October and the beginning of November;
*Christmas (&quot;Noël&quot;), two weeks around Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Day;
*winter (&quot;hiver&quot;), two weeks starting in mid-February;
*spring (&quot;printemps&quot;) or Easter (&quot;Pâques&quot;), two weeks starting in mid-April;
*summer (&quot;été&quot;), two months starting in early July. (mid-June for high school students).

==Primary school==

Most parents start sending their children to preschool (&quot;maternelle&quot;) when they turn 3. Some even start earlier at age 2 in &quot;toute petite section&quot; (&quot;&quot;TPS&quot;). The first two years of preschool (TPS and &quot;petite section&quot; &quot;PS&quot;&quot;) are introductions to community living; children learn how to become students and are introduced to their first notions of arithmetic, begin to recognize letters, develop oral language, etc. The last two years of preschool, &quot;moyenne section&quot; and &quot;grande section,&quot; are more school-like; pupils are introduced to reading, writing and more mathematics.

A preschool can be stand-alone (mostly true in towns and cities) or be affiliated to an elementary school (mostly in villages). As in other educational systems, primary school students in France usually have a single teacher (or two) who teaches the entire curriculum, without specialist teachers.

After kindergarten, the young students move on to the &quot;école élémentaire&quot; (elementary school). In the first 3 years of elementary school, they learn to write, develop their reading skills and get some basics in subjects such as French, mathematics, science and the arts, to name a few. The French word for a teacher at the primary school level is &quot;professeur&quot; or &quot;professeure des écoles&quot; (previously called &quot;instituteur&quot;, or its feminine form &quot;institutrice&quot;).

Children stay in elementary school for 5 years until they are 10–11 years-old. The grades are named: CP (&quot;cours préparatoire&quot;), CE1 (&quot;cours élémentaire 1&quot;), CE2 (&quot;cours élémentaire 2&quot;), CM1 (&quot;cours moyen 1&quot;) and CM2 (&quot;cours moyen 2&quot;).

==Middle school and high school==

The compulsory middle and high school subjects cover French language and literature, history and geography, foreign languages, arts and crafts, musical education, civics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, natural sciences, technology, and PE. The curriculum is set by the Ministry of National Education and applies to most collèges in France and also to AEFE-dependent institutions. Académies and individual schools have little freedom in the State curriculum.

Class sizes vary from school to school, but usually range from 20 to 35 pupils.

After primary school, two educational stages follow:
*collège (middle school), for children during their first four years of secondary education from the age of 11 to 15.
* lycée (high school), which provides a three-year course of further secondary education for children between the ages of 15 and 18. Pupils are prepared for the (baccalaureate, colloquially known as &quot;le bac&quot;) or the CAP (&quot;Certificat d&#x27;aptitude professionnelle&quot;). The &quot;baccalauréat&quot; can lead to higher education studies or directly to professional life (there are three main types of &quot;baccalauréat&quot;: the &quot;baccalauréat général&quot;, the &quot;baccalauréat technologique&quot;, and the &quot;baccalauréat professionnel&quot;).
* CFA (&quot;centre de formation des apprentise&quot;, apprentice learning center), which provides vocational degrees: &quot;le Certificat d&#x27;aptitude professionnelle&quot;.

==Private schools==

Primary and secondary private schools in France are divided into two categories:
*&quot;Private schools which respect the State curriculum&quot; (known as &quot;under contract&#x27;) are private, fee-paying institutions where pupils study the same national curriculum as those in public schools. Teachers in private schools are recruited in the same way and have roughly the same status as their equivalents in public schools. They are also employed directly by the State, but they are not permanently assigned and may not return to a public school position. The great majority of private schools in France are &quot;under contract&quot;.
*&quot;Private schools without contract&quot; employ their teachers directly and may teach their own curriculum; the State, however, still monitors their educational standards. Most of these schools provide religious instruction in parallel with a broad curriculum.

==International education==
As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed France as having 105 international schools. ISC defines an &#x27;international school&#x27; in the following terms: &quot;ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country&#x27;s national curriculum and is international in its orientation.&quot; That definition is used by publications including The Economist.

France has its own international school regulator, the AEFE (Agence pour l&#x27;enseignement français à l&#x27;étranger).

== Higher education ==

Higher education in France is organized in three levels, which correspond to those of other European countries, facilitating international mobility: the &quot;Licence&quot; and &quot;Licence Professionnelle&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degrees), and the Master&#x27;s and Doctorat degrees. The Licence and the Master are organized in semesters: 6 for the Licence and 4 for the Master. Those levels of study include various &quot;parcours&quot; or paths based on UE (Unités d&#x27;enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS). A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A licence is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained; a master is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained.

Licence and master&#x27;s degrees are offered within specific &quot;domaines&quot; and carry a specific &quot;mention&quot;. &quot;Spécialités&quot;, which are either research-oriented or professionally oriented during the second year of the Master. There are also professional licences whose objective is immediate job integration. It is possible to return to school later by continuing education or to validate professional experience (through VAE, Validation des Acquis de l’Expérience).

Higher education in France is divided between grandes écoles and public universities. The grandes écoles admit the graduates of the level Baccalauréat + 2 years of validated study (or sometimes directly after the Baccalauréat) whereas universities admit all graduates of the Baccalauréat.

Higher education in France was reshaped by the student revolts of May 1968. During the 1960s, French public universities responded to a massive explosion in the number of students (280,000 in 1962–63 to 500,000 in 1967–68) by stuffing approximately one-third of their students into hastily developed campus annexes (roughly equivalent to American satellite campuses) which lacked decent amenities, resident professors, academic traditions, or the dignity of university status. With so many students ripe for radicalization after being forced to study in such miserable conditions, change was necessary and inevitable. Rather than expand already-overwhelmed parent campuses, it was decided to split off the annexes as new universities.

As a result, French higher education, compared with other countries, is small in size with a multiplicity of establishments, each specialised in a more-or-less broad spectrum of areas. A middle-sized French city, such as Grenoble or Nancy, may have 2 or 3 universities (focused on science, sociological studies, engineering, etc.) as well as a number of other establishments specialised in higher education. In Paris and its suburbs, there are currently 11 universities (there were 13 from 1970 to 2017), none of which is specialised in one area or another, plus many smaller institutions that are highly specialised. It is not uncommon for graduate teaching programmes (master&#x27;s degrees, the course part of doctorate programmes etc.) to be operated in common by several institutions, allowing the institutions to present a larger variety of courses.

In engineering schools and the professional degrees of universities, a large share of the teaching staff is often made up of non-permanent professors; instead, part-time professors are hired to teach one specific subject. Part-time professors are generally hired from neighbouring universities, research institutes or industries.

Another original feature of the French higher education system is that a large share of the scientific research is carried out by research establishments such as CNRS or INSERM, which are not formally part of the universities. However, in most cases, the research units of those establishments are located inside universities (or other higher education establishments) and jointly operated by the research establishment and the university.

In 2021, 1.65 million students are enrolled in French higher education institutions (61% in licence, 35% in master, 4% in doctorat).

===Tuition costs===
Higher education is mostly funded by the State which leads to very low tuition fees. For citizens of the EU, EEA, Switzerland or Quebec, the annual fees range from 170 to 380 euros per year depending on the level (&quot;licence, master, doctorat&quot;). One can therefore get a master&#x27;s degree (in 5 years) for about €750–3,500. For other international students, these fees range from 2,770 to 3,770 euros. Students from low-income families can apply for scholarships, paying nominal sums for tuition or textbooks, and can receive a monthly stipend of up to €450 per month.

The tuition in public engineering schools is comparable to universities but a little higher (around €700). However, it can reach €7,000 a year for private engineering schools. Private business schools typically charge up to €12,000 a year for Bachelor programmes and up to €24,000 for Master programmes, while some elite institutions may charge €40,000 and more.

Health insurance for students is free until the age of 20 and so only the costs of living and books must be added. After the age of 20, health insurance for students costs €200 a year and covers most of the medical expenses.

Some public schools have other ways of gaining money. Some do not receive funds for class trips and other extra activities and so those schools may ask for a small entrance fee for new students.

===Universities===

==== Public universities ====

The public universities in France are named after the major cities near which they are located, followed by a numeral if there are several. Paris, for example, has 13 universities, labelled Paris I to XIII. Some of them are in Paris itself, some in the suburbs. In addition, most of the universities have taken a more informal name that is usually that of a famous person or a particular place. Sometimes, it is also a way to honor a famous alumnus, for example the science university in Strasbourg is known as &quot;Université Louis-Pasteur&quot; while its official name is &quot;Université Strasbourg I&quot; (however, since 2009, the three universities of Strasbourg have been merged).

The French system has undergone a reform, the Bologna process, which aims at creating European standards for university studies, most notably a similar time-frame everywhere, with three years devoted to the bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Licence&quot; in French), two for the Master&#x27;s degree, and three for the doctorate. French universities have also adopted the ECTS credit system (for example, a licence is worth 180 credits). The traditional curriculum based on end of semester examinations tends to remain in place in some universities. That double standard has added complexity to a system. It is difficult to change a major during undergraduate studies without losing a semester or even a whole year. Students usually also have few course selection options once they enroll in a particular diploma.

There are about 4,000 Master programmes offered in the French university system (listed at trouvermonmaster.gouv.fr), and 17,000 undergraduate programmes (offered by Parcoursup).

==== IUTs ====
There are also the IUTs (University Technical Institutes). This is a type of university college, usually in small and medium-sized towns, at satellite campuses of larger universities, that offers post-secondary study programmes designed to provide higher vocational education or the technical skills needed to perform the tasks of a particular and specific job. The degree awarded by IUTs is the &quot;Bachelor Universitaire de Technologie&quot;, (in English: &quot;Bachelor of Technical Studies&quot;) which is very similar to a Bachelor of Applied Science.

==== Other universities ====
France also hosts rare catholic universities recognized by the French Government as &quot;free&quot; private colleges (&quot;Facultés Libres&quot;), the largest one being the Catholic University of Lille. There are also branch colleges of foreign universities, which include Baruch College, the University of London Institute in Paris, Parsons Paris School of Art and Design and the American University of Paris.

===Public and private &quot;Grandes écoles&quot;===
The &quot;grandes écoles&quot; of France are elite higher-education institutions. They are generally focused on a single subject area (e.g., engineering or business), have a small size (typically between 100 and 300 graduates per year), and are highly selective. They are widely regarded as prestigious, and most of France&#x27;s scientists and executives have graduated from a &quot;grande école&quot;.

National rankings are published every year by various magazines. While the rankings slightly vary from year to year, the top &quot;grandes écoles&quot; have been very stable for decades:

* science and engineering: Écoles Normales Supérieures, École polytechnique, Mines ParisTech, Télécom Paris, ISAE-Supaéro, Ponts Paristech, Ecole Nationale de l&#x27;Aviation Civile, École nationale supérieure d&#x27;ingénieurs Sud-Alsace and CentraleSupélec;
* humanities: three Écoles Normales Supérieures, École des Chartes, and CELSA – Sorbonne;
* business: HEC Paris, NEOMA Business School, ESSEC Business School, ESCP Europe, INSEAD, EMLyon, Audencia, Grenoble École de Management, INSEEC and EDHEC;
* administration and political sciences: ENA and Institutes of Political Studies (Sciences Po Aix, Sciences Po Bordeaux, Sciences Po Grenoble, Sciences Po Lille, Sciences Po Lyon, Sciences Po Paris, Sciences Po Rennes, Sciences Po Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Sciences Po Strasbourg).

=== Private higher education ===
Private higher education in France is made possible by the fundamental principle of freedom of education. The Laboulaye Law of 12 July 1875, repealed in 2000, on the freedom of higher education stipulated that &quot;higher education is free&quot;, albeit with a few conditions to be met: declaration to the State; administrators and professors who have not been convicted; annual publication of corporate accounts.

In France, there are two main categories of private higher education colleges and universities:

* &quot;free&quot; private colleges (&quot;Facultés Libres&quot;): these private higher education colleges generally correspond to free faculties, most of which were created in the 19th century following the 1875 law on the freedom of higher education, and to Catholic Universities – officially &quot;Catholic Institutes&quot; – which may group together several free faculties. Sciences Po was a free private college until its nationalization in 1945 as a public &quot;Grande école&quot;. These institutions are not-for-profit associations, and have all obtained the French State qualification of &quot;établissement d&#x27;enseignement supérieur privé d&#x27;intérêt général&quot; (EESPIG); 
* &quot;technical&quot; private colleges (&quot;Écoles Techniques&quot;): they correspond to the vast majority of private &quot;Grandes Écoles&quot; and colleges of higher education in France, a small number of which are not-for-profit associations under contract with the State through the &quot;EESPIG&quot; general interest qualification. The remainder are commercial – for-profit – companies, as well as former public consular colleges that have opted for limited company status (like HEC Paris, EMLyon, or ESSEC Business School); and private high schools offering higher education courses (STS, CPGE).

Since 2018, a public university can integrate not only public faculties, but also private colleges (which have &quot;EESPIG&quot; accreditation, which means of general interest) as part of an experimental public-private partnership. Voices have been raised in the teaching community, fearing the privatization of French public higher education and tuition fee increases.

In France, private colleges and universities cannot award national Bachelor&#x27;s (&quot;Licence&quot;) and Master&#x27;s degrees. They can, however, either: set up co-diploma partnerships with public universities to deliver their national diplomas, or have their own diplomas accredited by the French Ministry of Higher Education (the accredited diploma, or &quot;&quot;Diplôme Visé&quot;), or have their programs certified (with the &quot;Titre&quot;) by the public vocational training agency France Compétences, under the authority of the French Ministry of Labor.

===Preparatory classes (CPGEs)===
Preparatory classes (in French &quot;classes préparatoires aux grandes écoles&quot;&quot; or CPGE), widely known as &quot;prépas&quot;, are courses whose main goal is to prepare students for enrollment in a &quot;grande école&quot;. Admission to CPGEs is based on academic performance during the last two years of high school, called &quot;Première&quot; and &quot;Terminale&quot;. Only 5% of a given cohort is admitted to a &quot;prépa&quot;. CPGEs are usually located within high schools but are a part of tertiary education, which means that to be admitted, each student must have already successfully passed their (or equivalent). Most CPGE receive applications from hundreds of applicants every year in April and May, and then selects students based on their own criteria. A few mainly private CPGEs, accounting for 10% of CPGEs, also have an interview process and ‘ or expect student participation in local community initiatives.

The ratio of CPGE students who fail to enter any &quot;grande école&quot; is lower in scientific and business CPGEs than in humanities CPGEs.

Some preparatory classes are widely considered &quot;elite&quot;, being extremely selective, and recruiting only the best students from each high school, if not the best student from each high school. These CPGEs practically guarantee their students a place in one of the top &quot;grandes écoles&quot;. Among them are the Lycée Louis-Le-Grand, the Lycée Henri-IV, the Lycée Stanislas and the Lycée privé Sainte-Geneviève.

====Scientific CPGEs====
The oldest CPGEs are the science ones, which can be accessed only with a bac in science Bacheliers. Science CPGE are called TSI (&quot;Technology and Engineering Science&quot;), MPSI (&quot;Mathematics, Physics and Engineering Science&quot;), PCSI (&quot;Physics, Chemistry, and Engineering Science&quot;) or PTSI (&quot;Physics, Technology, and Engineering Science&quot;) in the first year, MP (&quot;Mathematics and Physics&quot;), PSI (&quot;Physics and Engineering Science&quot;), PC (&quot;Physics and Chemistry&quot;) or PT (&quot;Physics and Technology&quot;) in the second year and BCPST (&quot;Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Life and Earth Sciences&quot;).

The first year of a CPGE is widely known as &quot;Math Sup&quot;, or &quot;Hypotaupe&quot;, (Sup for &quot;Classe de Mathématiques Supérieures&quot;, superior in French, meaning post-high school), and second year as &quot;Math Spé&quot;, or &quot;Taupe&quot;, (Spés standing for &quot;Classe de Mathématiques Spéciales&quot;, special in French). The students of these classes are known as &quot;Taupins&quot;. Both the first and second year programmes include as much as twelve hours of mathematics teaching per week, ten hours of physics, two hours of philosophy, two to four hours of (one or two) foreign languages and four to six hours of options: chemistry, &quot;SI&quot; (Engineering Industrial Science) or &quot;Theoretical Computer Science&quot; (including some programming using the Pascal or CaML programming languages, as a practical work). There are also several hours of homework, which can double the class-based workload. A well-known joke among CPGE students is that they become moles for two years, sometimes three, hence the nicknames &quot;taupe&quot; and &quot;taupin&quot; (&quot;taupe&quot; being the French word for a mole).

====Business CPGEs====
There are also CPGEs that are focused on economics (who prepare the admission in business schools). They are known as &quot;prépa EC&quot; (short for &quot;Economiques et Commerciales&quot;) and are divided into two parts: &quot;prépa ECS&quot;, which focuses more on mathematics, generally for those who graduated the scientific baccalauréat, and &quot;prépa ECE&quot;, which focuses more on economics, for those who were in the economics section in high school.

====Humanities CPGEs (Hypokhâgne and Khâgne)====
The literary and humanities CPGEs have also their own nicknames, &quot;Hypokhâgne&quot; for the first year and &quot;Khâgne&quot; for the second year. The students are called the &quot;khâgneux&quot;. Those classes prepare for schools such as the three Écoles Normales Supérieures, the École des Chartes, and sometimes Sciences Po.

There are two kinds of &quot;Khâgnes&quot;. The &quot;Khâgne de Lettres&quot; is the most common, and focuses on philosophy, French literature, history and languages. The &quot;Khâgne de Lettres et Sciences Sociales&quot; (Literature and Social Sciences), otherwise called Khâgne B/L, also includes mathematics and socio-economic sciences in addition to those literary subjects.

The students of Hypokhâgne and Khâgne (the humanities CPGE) are simultaneously enrolled in universities, and can go back to university in case of failure or if they feel unable to pass the highly competitive entrance examinations for the &quot;Écoles Normales Supérieures&quot;.

====Colles====
The amount of work required of the students is high. In addition to class time and homework, students spend several hours each week completing oral exams called &quot;colles&quot; (sometimes written &#x27;khôlles&#x27; to look like a Greek word, that way of writing being initially a &quot;khâgneux″s&quot; joke since &quot;khâgneux&quot; study Ancient Greek). The &quot;colles&quot; are unique to French academic education in CPGEs.

In scientific and business CPGEs, &quot;colles&quot; consist of oral examinations twice a week, in French, foreign languages (usually English, German, or Spanish), maths, physics, philosophy, or geopolitics—depending on the type of CPGE. Students, usually in groups of three or four, spend an hour facing a professor alone in a room, answering questions and solving problems.

In humanities CPGEs, &quot;colles&quot; are usually taken every quarter in every subject. Students have one hour to prepare a short presentation that takes the form of a French-style &quot;dissertation&quot; (a methodologically codified essay, typically structured in 3 parts: thesis, counter-thesis, and synthesis) in history, philosophy, etc. on a given topic, or the form of a &quot;commentaire composé&quot; (a methodologically codified form of literary criticism) in literature and foreign languages. In Ancient Greek or Latin, they involve a translation and a commentary. The student then has 20 minutes to present his/her work to the teacher, who finally asks some questions on the presentation and on the corresponding topic.

&quot;Colles&quot; are regarded as very stressful, particularly due to the high standards expected by the teachers, and the subsequent harshness that may be directed at students who do not perform adequately. But they are important insofar as they prepare the students, from the very first year, for the oral part of the highly competitive examinations, which are reserved for the happy few who pass the written part.

===Recruitment of teachers===
Decades ago, primary school teachers were educated in Écoles normales and secondary teachers recruited through the &quot;Agrégation&quot; examination. The situation has been diversified by the introduction in the 1950s of the CAPES examination for secondary teachers and in the 1990s by the institution of &quot;Instituts universitaires de formation des maitres&quot; (IUFM), which have been renamed Écoles supérieures du professorat et de l’éducation (ESPE) in 2013 and then Instituts Nationaux supérieurs du professorat et de l’éducation (INSPE) in 2019.

Precisely, school teachers are divided between :
* Primary school and kindergarten teachers (Professeurs des écoles), educated in an INSPE, have usually a &quot;master&quot; (Bac+5). Their weekly service is about 28 hours a week.
* Certified teachers (Professeurs certifiés), educated in both a University and an INSPE, have a &quot;master&quot; (Bac+5) and must pass a competitive exam called Certificat d&#x27;aptitude au professorat de l&#x27;enseignement du second degré (CAPES) in a specific domain. Their rank usually determines their geographic assignment for the first years of their careers. The majority of them are teaching in &quot;collège&quot; (middle school).
* &quot;Agrégés&quot; teachers (Professeurs agrégés) are recruited through a different competitive exam called &quot;Agrégation&quot;, of much higher level in each domain. They could either be certified teachers or external holders of at least a &quot;master&quot; (Bac+5) in the domain. In the latter case they must attend an additional formation in teaching in an INSPE. &quot;Agrégés&quot; teachers have a higher salary rate and reduced weekly service. The majority of them are teaching in &quot;lycée&quot; (high school).

University teachers are recruited by special commissions, and are divided between:

* &quot;teachers-researchers&quot; (enseignants-chercheurs), with at least a doctorate: they teach classes and conduct research in their field of expertise with a full tenure. They are either Maître de conférences (Senior lecturers), or Professeurs (Professors). A Maître de conférence must publish a reviewed work named Habilitation à diriger des recherches (HDR) (professorial thesis) in order to be allowed to become the director of studies for PhD students. The HDR is in turn necessary to be appointed as Professeur. The net pay (all insurances included) is from 2,300 to 8,800 (with extra duties) euros per month. Net salaries of over 4,000 euros per month (2011 level) are however very unusual, and limited to the small minority of teacher-researchers who have held the grade of first class full professor for at least seven years, which is rare. The maximum possible net salary for second-class full professors and chief senior lecturers (maître de conférence hors classe), the end of career status for most full-time teacher-researchers in French universities, is 3,760 euros a month (2011), and only a few of the group ever reach that level.
* Secondary school teachers who have been permanently assigned away from their original school position to teach in a university. They are not required to conduct any research but teach twice as many hours as the &quot;teachers-researchers&quot;. They are called PRAG (professeurs agrégés) and PRCE (professeurs certifiés). Their weekly service is 15 or 18 hours. The net pay is from 1,400 to 3,900 euros per month.
* CPGE teachers are usually &quot;agrégés&quot; or &quot;chaire sup&quot;, assigned by the Inspection générale according to their qualifications and competitive exam rank as well as other factors.

*France did a great activity of supplying training for their people, via way of means of the 1800s, France had approximately 350 eight-yr faculties and six-yr faculties. Also in the course of the 1800s, they furnished classical training to approximately 50,000 to younger guys from a long time of 10–20. Getting greater specific, the very best increase charge of training in France became in the course of the 1821–1837 whilst towns welcomed new colleges. The increase charge slowed in the course of 1837–1867 because the authorities reached thinly populated rural areas. Then, via way of means of 1867–1906, the emphasis became on deepening the first-rate of colleges and teaching. Camille Sée added secondary colleges for ladies in 1880, which became a vital pass due to the fact he furnished secondary faculty stage of training to ladies. There have been 36 such colleges in France in 1896.

==Religion==
Religious instruction is not given by public schools (except for 6- to 18-year-old students in Alsace and Moselle under the Concordat of 1801). Laïcité (secularism) is one of the main precepts of the French Republic.

In a March 2004 ruling, the French government banned all &quot;conspicuous religious symbols&quot; from schools and other public institutions with the intent of preventing proselytisation and to foster a sense of tolerance among ethnic groups. Some religious groups showed their opposition, saying the law hindered the freedom of religion as protected by the French constitution.

==Statistics==
The French Republic has 67 million inhabitants, living in the 13 regions of metropolitan France and four overseas departments (2.7 million). Despite the fact that the population is growing (up 0.4% a year), the proportion of young people under 25 is falling. There are now fewer than 19 million young people in Metropolitan France, or 32% of the total population, compared with 40% in the 1970s and 35% at the time of the 1990 census. France is seeing a slow aging of the population, however, that is less marked than in other neighbouring countries (such as Germany and Italy), especially as the annual number of births is currently increasing slightly.

Eighteen million pupils and students, a quarter of the population, are in the education system, over 2.9 million of whom are in higher education. In 2000, the French Education Minister reported that only 39 out of 75,000 state schools were &quot;seriously violent&quot; and some 300 were &quot;somewhat violent&quot;.
