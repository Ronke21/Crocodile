<text>Kottabos () was a game of skill played at Ancient Greek and Etruscan symposia (drinking parties), especially in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. It involved flinging wine-lees (sediment) at a target in the middle of the room. The winner would receive a prize (κοττάβιον or &quot;kottabion&quot;), comprising cakes, sweetmeats, or kisses.

Ancient writers, including Dionysius Chalcus, Alcaeus, Anacreon, Pindar, Bacchylides, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Antiphanes, make frequent and familiar allusion to the practice; and it is depicted on contemporaneous red-figure vases. References to the practice by the writers of the Roman and Alexandrian periods show that the fashion had died out. In Latin literature, it is almost entirely unknown.

Dexterity was required to succeed in the game, and unusual ability was rated as highly as corresponding excellence in throwing the javelin. Kottabos was customary, and, at least in Sicily, special circular buildings were established, so the players might easily be arranged around the target, and follow each other in rapid succession. Like all games in which the element of chance found a place, it was regarded as more or less ominous of the future success of the players, especially in matters of love – and the excitement was sometimes further augmented by some object of value being staked on the event. The stake in the game was often a attending the symposium with the players.

== Origin ==

The kottabos game seems to have originated in Sicily, or the land of the Sikels, but it spread through Greece, from Thessaly to Rhodes, becoming especially fashionable at Athens. Evidence of its origin can be found on an Attic red-figure psykter by Euphronios, depicting four hetairai. One of the hetairai on the vase, Smikra, is swinging her cup, as a kottabos player. The inscription beside her is Doric, the dialect used by the Sicilians.

== Rules of play ==
As Antiphanes wrote in his play: &quot;the kottabos player puts the index finger of the right-hand through the handle of the drinking cup, palm upwards; and the remaining fingers are spread as playing a flute.&quot; The player reclines on the couch, leaning on the left elbow; and, moving only the right-forearm, throws the wine-lees.

==Kottabos kataktos==

When playing kottabos kataktos, also called kottabos with a pole, the target is the plastinx (πλάστιγξ), a small disc, balanced horizontally atop a bronze lamp stand. Halfway down the stand is a larger disc called the manes (μάνης). Sometimes a bronze statuette is used, with the plastinx balanced on its extended arms, or on its head. Some refer to this statuette as the manes, since Manes was a Phrygian slave name; and it would make sense to connect that name with this small figure. But according to Antiphanes, the plastinx should fall onto the manes with a loud noise, which seems unlikely if the manes is the statuette. The player is expected to throw the wine-lees found in the drinking cup, in such a way that it does not break bulk in its passage through the air, towards the plastinx. Success entails making the plastinx fall to the manes, causing a bell-like sound. Both the wine thrown, and the noise made, were called latax (λάταξ).

==Variations==

Kottabos kataktos was the traditional and correct way of playing, but there were various modifications that were acceptable:

=== Kottabos with oxybapha ===
In Kottabos with an oxybaphon (Κότταβος δι᾽ ὀξυβάφων), or kottabos in a bowl, the target of the throw is a bowl, or lekane. The lekane is filled with water, and empty shallow saucers (ὀξύβαφα or oxybapha) float on the water. The object is to throw the wine-lees onto the oxybapha, to sink them, which is easier than the kottabos kataktos. The player who sank the most was the winner. This form of playing is rarely found on vases, presumably because it would be difficult to paint the interior of the lekane, with oxybapha floating in it, on a vase.

=== Combination of kataktos and oxybapha ===
There is a special kottabos stand found in Italy, Etruscan with a pole and a bowl at the bottom. It combines the kottabos kataktos with the variation involving oxybapha. The lower was probably the lekane used to float the oxybapha, while the pole can be used to play the original form.

===Sunken kottabos===
Sunken kottabos (Κότταβος κατακτός) is not so simple. The apparatus &quot;(kottabeion, pl. kottabeia)&quot; were the rhabdus (ῥάβδος, a bronze pole), the plastinx (πλάστιγξ, a small saucer like that on a balance), the lecanis (λεκανίς, a large saucer), and the manes (μάνης, a bronze figurine).

The discovery in Etruscan burial sites (by Wolfgang Helbig in 1886) of two sets of actual apparatus in Umbria, near Perugia, as well as various representations on Greek vases help explain the somewhat obscure accounts of how kottabos was played.

The rhabdus (pole) had a flat base, and the main structure tapered towards the top, with a blunt end (on which the plastinx or manes was balanced). The plastinx (small saucer) had a hole near the edge and was slightly concave in the middle.

About two-thirds of the way down, the rhabdus was encircled by the lecanis (large saucer). A socket near the top of the rhabdus held the manes (figurine). The manes was in the shape of a man, with his right arm and leg uplifted, sometimes holding a drinking horn (or &quot;rhytum&quot;).

According to Helbig, three games were played with this apparatus:

==== Method No. 1 ====
The plastinx (small saucer) was fixed on top of the rhabdus (pole), with the lecanis (large saucer) below. The players tried to fill the plastinx with enough wine to tip it over (with a crash) onto the lecanis.

==== Method No. 2 ====
Played exactly the same as method No. 1, except that the plastinx was supposed to hit the manes (figurine) on the way down to the lecanis.

==== Method No. 3 ====
Played exactly the same as method No. 1, except that the manes (instead of the plastinx) was fixed on top of the rhabdus, and it was at this that the wine was thrown.

=== Kottabos with a phallus-headed bird ===
Another variation of the kottabos involves a different kind of target. On a red-figure cup by Apollodoros, it shows some symposiasts aiming at a target with a phallus-headed bird balancing on top of a tripod which is placed on a flat pan. The pan is inscribed KOTABOS, so it is certain which game is played. This target is unique, and it emphasizes the erotic side of both the game and the symposium.

== Kottabos toast ==
Before the kottabos player throws the wine-lees, the turn is dedicated to a . The player&#x27;s words can be a sort of toast or dedication to the person of affection. The toast can serve as a question about the possibility of success in love, which would be answered by the outcome of the throw. It emphasizes the love nature of this game, and the core idea of bonding at the symposium.

One of the most famous inscriptions is on the red-figure &quot;psykter&quot; of the four hetairai by Euphronios. On this &quot;psykter&quot;, Smikra is dedicating her turn to Leagros. The inscription says: &quot;&quot;Tin tande latasso leagre&quot; (I am throwing this for you, Leagros).&quot; Leagros was a popular youth frequently named in kalos inscriptions on sympotic vases around this period.

Sometimes painters would use gods as representations of a kottabos player when giving a kottabos toast. On a red-figure stamnos by the Copenhagen painter, Dionysus is painted as one of these representations. The inscription beside his arm says: &quot;&quot;tot tende&quot; (this is for you).&quot; On the left, a satyr completes the sentence: &quot;&quot;lykoi&quot; (for Lykos)&quot;, who was a youth popular at the time, and known from other inscriptions. Apparently, the god is used as a mouthpiece for a human to speak of his affection.

On another red-figure cup, the inscription, &quot;&quot;ho pais kalos&quot; (the youth is beautiful)&quot;, seems to spring out from the player&#x27;s cup, and follow the trajectory of the wine that is being thrown.

Kottabos involves disruption of equilibrium when the plastinx falls, or the &quot;oxybapha&quot; are sunk. This break in equilibrium symbolizes the uncertainty a person may feel when a lover is present. So when balance is broken, the sound of the plastinx falling onto the manes, and the sunk of the &quot;oxybapha&quot;, serves as a good omen, indicating that the love of the player is assured. The successful play of the kottabos game would represent success when pursuing love or being loved by young men and women.

== Female Kottabos players ==

Women were not usually the recipient of the kottabos toast, so a scene depicting women kottabos players, like the four hetairai by Euphronios, naming a popular youth as the subject of the toast, might be a joke. Another interpretation of the four hetairai is that these female symposiasts are Spartans. This would account for the Doric dialect used on the inscription and also the absence of couches, which is consistent with the stereotypes about Sparta held by the Athenians. The use of female symposiasts as a humorous trope is consistent with several black-figure vases with figures that are interpreted as Etruscan women. As with Spartan women, they were considered to be uncivilized.

== Kottabos cup in Oxford ==
Most of the cups being used to play the kottabos game were regular &quot;kylikes&quot; as shown on painted pots. But there is a unique kottabos cup in Oxford: instead of a regular foot, this cup has a conical-shaped projection at the bottom. It is said to be a cup customized for playing the kottabos. Wear on the handles accords with the way a kottabos player would employ the cup. With its special foot, it would be conveniently carried as a personal kottabos cup to symposiums.

<text>GameTek was an American video game publisher based in North Miami Beach, Florida known for publishing video game adaptations of game shows in the late 1980s and early 1990s. GameTek was a trade name for IJE, the owner of electronic publishing rights to &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;. Originally, IJE licensed these titles to ShareData of Chandler, Arizona; however, when IJE saw ShareData&#x27;s success with the titles, IJE decided to publish the titles themselves, resulting in the founding of GameTek.

After establishing distribution for the game show titles, GameTek expanded by licensing European titles for the North American market, including &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Humans&quot;. In 1991, they attempted to launch the InfoGenius Systems franchise for the Game Boy. In 1994, the company made a deal to purchase game developer Malibu Interactive from Malibu Comics and renamed to Padded Cell Studios.

In 1996, GameTek scaled down its publishing activities, turning most of that aspect of its business over to Philips. GameTek filed for bankruptcy in December 1997, citing development delays and disappointing sales, and went out of business in July 1998. Most of the company&#x27;s assets were acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 1997.

<doc id="379943" wikidata="Q891878" url="?curid=379943" title="Birmingham pub bombings">
<text>The Birmingham pub bombings were carried out on 21 November 1974, when bombs exploded in two public houses in Birmingham, England, killing 21 people and injuring 182 others.

The Provisional IRA never officially admitted responsibility for the bombings, although a former senior officer of the organisation confessed to their involvement in 2014. In 2017, one of the alleged perpetrators, Michael Hayes, also claimed that the intention of the bombings had not been to harm civilians, and that their deaths had been caused by an unintentional delay in delivering an advance telephone warning to security services.

Six Irishmen were arrested within hours of the blasts and in 1975 sentenced to life imprisonment for the bombings. The men—who became known as the Birmingham Six—maintained their innocence and insisted police had coerced them into signing false confessions through severe physical and psychological abuse. After 16 years in prison, and a lengthy campaign, their convictions were declared unsafe and unsatisfactory, and quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991. The episode is seen as one of the worst miscarriages of justice in British legal history.

The Birmingham pub bombings were one of the deadliest acts of the Troubles and the deadliest act of terrorism to occur in England between the Second World War and the 2005 London bombings.

==Background==

In 1973, the Provisional IRA extended its campaign to mainland Britain, attacking military and symbolically important targets to both increase pressure on the British government, via popular British opinion, to withdraw from Northern Ireland, and to maintain morale amongst their supporters. By 1974, mainland Britain saw an average of one attack—successful or otherwise—every three days. These attacks included five explosions which had occurred in Birmingham on 14 July, one of which had occurred at the Rotunda. Prior to any attack upon civilian targets, a code of conduct was followed in which the attacker or attackers would send an anonymous telephone warning to police, with the caller reciting a confidential code word known only to the Provisional IRA and to police, to indicate the authenticity of the threat.

On 14 November, James McDade, a 28-year-old UK-based member of the Provisional IRA, was killed in a premature explosion as he attempted to plant a bomb at a telephone exchange and postal sorting office in Coventry. Another man, Raymond McLaughlin, was arrested near the scene; he was charged with unlawfully killing McDade and causing an explosion. The republican movement in England had planned to bury McDade in Birmingham, with a paramilitary guard of honour. These plans were altered after the British Home Secretary vowed that such a funeral, and any associated sympathy marches, would be prevented. Councils in the West Midlands chose to ban any processions linked to the death of McDade under the Public Order Act 1936.

McDade&#x27;s body was driven to Birmingham Airport and flown to Ireland on the afternoon of 21 November 1974. Initially, his body had been scheduled to be flown to Belfast Airport; however, upon learning that staff at the airport had refused to handle the coffin, McDade&#x27;s body was instead flown to Dublin. All police leave was cancelled on this date, with an extra 1,300 officers drafted into Birmingham to quell any unrest as the hearse carrying McDade&#x27;s coffin was driven to the airport. McDade&#x27;s body was buried in Milltown Cemetery in Belfast on 23 November. According to a senior Provisional IRA figure, tensions within the Birmingham IRA unit were &quot;running high&quot; over the disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade.

==The bombings==
On the early evening of 21 November, at least three bombs connected to timing devices were planted inside two separate public houses and outside a bank located in and around central Birmingham. It is unknown precisely when these bombs were planted; if official IRA protocol of preceding attacks upon non-military installations with a 30-minute advance warning to security services was followed, and subsequent eyewitness accounts are accurate, the bombs would have been planted at these locations after 19:30 and before 19:47.

According to testimony delivered at the 1975 trial of the Birmingham Six, the bomb planted inside the &quot;Mulberry Bush&quot; was concealed inside either a duffel bag or briefcase, whereas the bomb planted inside the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; was concealed inside a briefcase or duffel bag (possibly concealed within a large, sealed plastic bag) and Christmas cracker boxes. The remnants of two alarm clocks recovered from the site of each explosion leaves the possibility that two bombs had been planted at each public house; the explosion crater at each location indicates that if two bombs had been planted at each public house, they would each have been placed in the same location and likely the same container.

Reportedly, those who planted these bombs then walked to a preselected phone box to telephone the advance warning to security services; however, the phone box had been vandalised, forcing the caller to find an alternative phone box and thus shortening the amount of time police had to clear the locations.

At 20:11, an unknown man with a distinct Irish accent telephoned the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; newspaper. The call was answered by operator Ian Cropper. This caller said: &quot;There is a bomb planted in the Rotunda and there is a bomb in New Street at the tax office. This is Double X&quot;, before terminating the call. (&quot;Double X&quot; was an IRA code word given to authenticate any warning call.) A similar warning was also sent to the &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot; newspaper, with the anonymous caller(s) again giving the code word, but again failing to name the public houses in which the bombs had been planted.

===Mulberry Bush===
The Rotunda is a 25-storey office block, built in the 1960s, that housed the &quot;Mulberry Bush&quot; pub on its lower two floors. Within minutes of the warning, police arrived and began checking the upper floors of the Rotunda, but they did not have sufficient time to clear the crowded pub at street level. At 20:17, six minutes after the first telephone warning had been delivered to the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;, the bomb—which had been concealed inside either a duffel bag or briefcase located close to the rear entrance to the premises—exploded, devastating the pub. The explosion blew a 40-inch (100 cm) crater in the concrete floor, collapsing part of the roof and trapping many casualties beneath girders and concrete blocks. Many buildings near the Rotunda were also damaged, and pedestrians in the street were struck by flying glass from shattered windows. Several of the victims died at the scene, including two youths who had been walking past the premises at the moment of the explosion.

Ten people were killed in this explosion and dozens were injured, including many who lost limbs. Several casualties had been impaled by sections of wooden furniture; others had their clothes burned from their bodies. A paramedic called to the scene of this explosion later described the carnage as being reminiscent of a slaughterhouse; one fireman said that, upon seeing a writhing, &quot;screaming torso&quot;, he had begged police to allow a television crew inside the premises to film the dead and dying at the scene, in the hope the IRA would see the consequences of their actions; however, the police refused this request, fearing the reprisals would be extreme.

One of those injured was 21-year-old Maureen Carlin, who had such extensive shrapnel wounds to her stomach and bowel she told her fiancé, Ian Lord (himself badly wounded in the explosion): &quot;If I die, just remember I love you&quot;. Carlin was given the last rites, with surgeons initially doubtful she would live, although she recovered from her injuries.

===Tavern in the Town===
The &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; was a basement pub on New Street located a short distance from the Rotunda and directly beneath the New Street Tax Office. Patrons there had heard the explosion at the &quot;Mulberry Bush&quot;, but did not believe that the sound (described by one survivor as a &quot;muffled thump&quot;) was an explosion.

Police had begun attempting to clear the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; when, at 20:27, a second bomb exploded there. The blast was so powerful that several victims were blown through a brick wall. Their remains were wedged between the rubble and live underground electric cables that supplied the city centre. One of the first police officers on the scene, Brian Yates, later testified that the scene which greeted his eyes was &quot;absolutely dreadful&quot;, with several of the dead stacked upon one another, others strewn about the ruined pub, and several screaming survivors staggering aimlessly amongst the debris, rubble, and severed limbs. A survivor said the sound of the explosion was replaced by a &quot;deafening silence&quot; and the smell of burnt flesh.

Rescue efforts at the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; were initially hampered as the bomb had been placed at the base of a set of stairs descending from the street which had been destroyed in the explosion, and the premises had been accessible solely via this entrance. The victims whose bodies had been blown through a brick wall and wedged between the rubble and underground electric cables took up to three hours to recover, as recovery operations were delayed until the power could be isolated. A passing West Midlands bus was also destroyed in the blast.

This bomb killed nine people outright, and injured everyone in the pub—many severely; two later died of their injuries: 28-year-old barman Thomas Chaytor on 28 November, and 34-year-old James Craig on 10 December.
After the second explosion, police evacuated all pubs and businesses in Birmingham city centre and commandeered all available rooms in the nearby City Centre Hotel as an impromptu first-aid post. All bus services into the city centre were halted, and taxi drivers were encouraged to transport those lightly injured in the explosions to hospital. Prior to the arrival of ambulances, rescue workers removed critically injured casualties from each scene upon makeshift stretchers constructed from devices such as tabletops and wooden planks. These severely injured casualties would be placed on the pavement and given first aid prior to the arrival of ambulance services.

===Hagley Road===
At 21:15, a third bomb, concealed inside two plastic bags, was found in the doorway of a Barclays Bank on Hagley Road, approximately two miles from the site of the first two explosions. This device consisted of of Frangex connected to a timer, and was set to detonate at 23:00. The detonator to this device activated when a policeman prodded the bags with his truncheon, but the bomb did not explode. The device was destroyed in a controlled explosion early the following morning.

===Fatalities===
Altogether, 21 people were killed and 182 injured in the Birmingham pub bombings, making them the deadliest terrorist attack in mainland Britain during the Troubles. Residents of Birmingham have referred to the Birmingham pub bombings as the &quot;darkest day&quot; in their city&#x27;s history.

Many of those wounded were left permanently disabled, including one young man who lost both legs, and a young woman who was blinded by shrapnel. The majority of the dead and wounded were between the ages of 17 and 30, including a young couple on their first date, a young woman whose boyfriend had intended to propose to her on the evening of her death, and two Irishmen, brothers Desmond and Eugene Reilly (aged 21 and 23 respectively). The widow of Desmond Reilly gave birth to his first child four months after his death. One of the victims, 18-year-old Maxine Hambleton, had only entered the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; to hand out tickets to friends for her housewarming party. She was killed seconds after entering the pub and had been standing directly beside the bomb when it exploded, killing her instantly. Her friend, 17-year-old Jane Davis, was one of two 17-year-olds killed in the bombings, and had entered the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; to view holiday photographs she had developed that afternoon.

==Initial reaction==
The bombings stoked considerable anti-Irish sentiment in Birmingham, which then had an Irish community of 100,000. Irish people were ostracised from public places and subjected to physical assaults, verbal abuse and death threats. Both in Birmingham and across England, Irish homes, pubs, businesses and community centres were attacked, in some cases with firebombs. Staff at thirty factories across the Midlands went on strike in protest at the bombings, while workers at airports across England refused to handle flights bound for Ireland. Bridget Reilly, the mother of the two Irish brothers killed in the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; explosion, was herself refused service in local shops.

The bombings were immediately blamed on the IRA, despite the organisation not having claimed responsibility. Due to anger against Irish people in Birmingham after the bombings, the IRA&#x27;s Army Council placed the city &quot;strictly off-limits&quot; to IRA active service units. In Northern Ireland, loyalist paramilitaries launched a wave of revenge attacks on Irish Catholics: within two days of the bombings, five Catholic civilians had been shot dead by loyalists.

===First IRA statement===
Two days after the bombings, the Provisional IRA issued a statement in which they denied any responsibility. This statement stressed that a detailed internal investigation was underway to determine the possibility of any rogue members&#x27; involvement, although the Provisional IRA emphasised that the methodology of the attacks contradicted the official IRA code of conduct when attacking non-military targets, whereby adequate warnings would be sent to security services to ensure the safety of civilians. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, then-president of Sinn Féin, conducted an internal investigation which, he stated, confirmed the bombings had not been sanctioned by the IRA leadership.

The Provisional IRA never officially admitted responsibility for the Birmingham pub bombings.

===Prevention of Terrorism Act===
Within four days of the bombings, Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary, announced that the Irish Republican Army was to be proscribed within the UK. Two days later, on 27 November, Jenkins introduced the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974, which granted the police in mainland Britain the right to arrest, detain, and question people for up to seven days if they were suspected of the commission or preparation of an act of terrorism on the British mainland, and their subsequent deportation to either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland if culpability was proven. Jenkins later described the measures of this Act as being &quot;draconian measures unprecedented in peacetime&quot;.

In response to public pressure, a separate debate within the House of Commons as to whether those convicted of terrorist offences should face the death penalty was held on 11 December 1974. This motion drew the support of more than 200 MPs, although the majority of those in Parliament voted against the restoration of the death penalty, reportedly in part due to fear that such a move could have encouraged the IRA to use children to plant bombs.

The Prevention of Terrorism Act became law on 29 November, and remained in force until superseded by the Terrorism Act in July 2000.

===Forensic analysis===
An analysis of the remnants of the bombs placed at the &quot;Mulberry Bush&quot; and the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; revealed these devices had been constructed in a similar manner to the bomb placed at Hagley Road. Each bomb placed inside the public houses would have weighed between 25 and 30 lbs, and had contained numerous shards of metal. The forensic analyst was able to state that the construction of these devices was very similar to that of seven other bombs and incendiary devices discovered at various locations in Birmingham, Coventry and Wolverhampton in the 16 days prior to the Birmingham pub bombings, and that the explosive material used to construct the bomb discovered at Hagley Road was of a brand solely manufactured in the Republic of Ireland which could not legally be imported into Britain. All these factors led the explosives expert to conclude that all three bombs had been manufactured by the same people, and that it was likely that whoever had constructed these bombs had also committed previous IRA attacks. This conclusion was further supported by the methodology of the attacks, and the official IRA code word given to the &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot; and &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; newspapers minutes before the explosions.

==The Birmingham Six==

===Arrest===
At 19:55 on 21 November (scarcely 20 minutes before the first bomb had exploded), five men—Patrick Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker—had boarded a train at Birmingham New Street station. These men—who, alongside Hugh Callaghan, would become known as the &quot;Birmingham Six&quot;—were originally from Northern Ireland. Five of the Birmingham Six hailed from Belfast, whereas John Walker had lived in Derry until age 16. All six men had lived in Birmingham for between 11 and 27 years respectively and, although they had known James McDade and/or his family to varying degrees, each man was adamant they had not known of his IRA affiliations.

When the bombs exploded, the booking clerk from whom the men had purchased tickets informed police that a man with an Irish accent, dressed in a dust-covered purple suit, had purchased a ticket to travel to the coastal village of Heysham, en route to Belfast. The man had then run onto the train. A spot check on ticket sales that evening revealed that four further tickets to travel to Belfast via Heysham had also been issued. Within three hours of the bombings, each man had been detained at Heysham Port and taken to Morecambe police station to undergo forensic tests to eliminate them as suspects in the bombings. Each man expressed their willingness to assist in these inquiries, having informed the officers of a half-truth as to the reason they had been travelling to Belfast: that they intended to visit their families, although they also intended to attend McDade&#x27;s funeral.

Between 03:00 and 06:10 the following morning, forensic scientist Frank Skuse conducted a series of Griess tests upon the hands, fingernails and belongings of the five men arrested at Heysham Port, to determine whether any of the men had handled the explosive nitroglycerine. He concluded with a 99% degree of certainty that both Patrick Hill and William Power had handled explosives, and remained uncertain as to the test results conducted on John Walker, whose right hand had tested positive, but whose left hand had tested negative. The test results upon Hunter and McIlkenny had been negative.

Each man was ordered to change his clothes. A search of Walker&#x27;s possessions revealed several mass cards printed in reference to the upcoming funeral of James McDade. Upon discovering these mass cards, two officers led Walker into an adjacent room, where he was repeatedly punched, kicked and, later, burned with a lit cigarette by three officers as his arms were restrained by the two policemen who had escorted him into the room. Similar assaults were committed upon Power, Hunter, Hill and, to a lesser degree, McIlkenny; the officers who administered these beatings took great care to avoid marking the men&#x27;s faces.

At 12:55 on the afternoon of 22 November, while detained at Morecambe police station, William Power signed a confession admitting his involvement in the Birmingham pub bombings. This confession was extracted after Power had been subjected to extreme physical and psychological abuse, which included repeated kicking in the stomach, head and legs, dragging by the hair, and the stretching of his scrotum.

====False confessions====
The five men were transferred to the custody of the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad on the afternoon of 22 November. At 22:45 that evening, Hugh Callaghan was arrested at his home in Birmingham and driven to Sutton Coldfield police station, where he was briefly questioned before being detained in a cell overnight, but intentionally denied sleep. The same evening Callaghan was arrested, the homes of all six men were extensively—and unsuccessfully—searched for explosives and explosive material.

Following their transfer to the custody of the West Midlands Crime Squad, three other members of the Birmingham Six (Callaghan, McIlkenny and Walker) signed false confessions on 23 November. In these three further false statements obtained by the West Midlands Crime Squad, Callaghan, McIlkenny and Walker each falsely claimed to be members of the IRA; to have conspired with McDade to cause explosions prior to his death; and to have planted the bombs at the &quot;Mulberry Bush&quot; and the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; public houses. As had been the case with William Power while detained at Morecambe police station, the three men later claimed that, before and during their transfer to Birmingham, officers had coerced them into signing these confessions through severe physical, psychological and emotional abuse. This mistreatment included beatings, deprivation of food and sleep, being subject to mock executions, intimidation, being burned with lit cigarettes, and being forced to stand or squat in various stress positions. In addition, each man had heard threats directed against their families. Hill and Hunter both claimed they had been subject to the same mistreatment, and although both men had refused to sign false confessions, police later claimed that both men had verbally confessed their guilt. On 24 November, each man was initially charged with the murder of 17-year-old Jane Davis, who had been killed in the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; explosion. All six were remanded in custody at Winson Green Prison, and they were only assigned solicitors the following day.

Inside Winson Green Prison, all six men were subject to the same mistreatment at the hands of prison officers as they had endured at the hands of police, with one of the men losing four teeth in one assault. At a further court hearing on 28 November, each man was observed to have extensive facial injuries; an examination by a prison doctor revealed each man had received extensive injuries not only to their faces, but across their bodies. (Following an independent investigation into this mistreatment, the British Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that 14 prison warders be charged with assault. These men were suspended from duty in December 1975; all 14 were found not guilty of 90 separate charges of misconduct and assault on 15 July 1976.)

====Second IRA statement====
Dáithí Ó Conaill, then a member of the Provisional IRA&#x27;s Army Council, had four days before the Birmingham pub bombings issued a statement declaring that the &quot;consequences of war&quot; would incessantly be felt not only in Northern Ireland, but on the British mainland, until the British government announced their intentions to &quot;disengage from Ireland&quot;. One week after the Birmingham Six had been charged with the murder of Jane Davis, Ó Conaill issued a further statement emphasising that none of the Birmingham Six had ever been members of the IRA. Ó Conaill further stated:

====Committal hearing====
At a committal hearing in May 1975, each man was formally charged with 21 counts of murder, with additional charges of conspiracy to cause explosions. Due to the wave of public outrage towards the perpetrators of the Birmingham pub bombings within the Midlands, Judge Bridge conceded to defence motions to move the trial away from the Midlands, and the trial was set to be heard within the Shire Hall and Crown Court of Lancaster Castle the following month. Also to stand trial with the Birmingham Six were three men: Mick Murray (a known member of the Provisional IRA who had previously been convicted of a separate charge of conspiracy to cause explosions), James Francis Gavin (a.k.a. James Kelly, who had likewise been tried alongside the Birmingham Six and convicted of the possession of explosives), who had allegedly constructed each of the bombs, and Michael Sheehan. Murray was also charged with conspiracy to cause explosions across the Midlands, with Kelly and Sheehan charged with possession of explosives.

Prior to the trial, defence lawyers for the Birmingham Six applied for their clients to be tried separately from Sheehan, Kelly and, particularly, Murray, stating that their clients&#x27; presumptions of innocence and denials of association with the IRA would be tainted if they were tried alongside an admitted member of the Provisional IRA, who had been convicted of causing explosions. This application was rejected by Judge Bridge, who was to preside over the trial.

===Trial===
On 9 June 1975, the Birmingham Six stood trial at Lancaster Crown Court before Judge Nigel Bridge. Each man was charged with 21 counts of murder and conspiring with the deceased James McDade to cause explosions across the Midlands between August and November 1974. Murray, Kelly and Sheehan were also charged with conspiracy to cause explosions across the Midlands, with Kelly and Sheehan facing the additional charges of possession of explosives.

All six men emphatically maintained their innocence, stating they had never been members of the IRA; that they had not known James McDade had been a member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army until his death; and reiterating their earlier claims of having been subject to intense physical and psychological abuse upon their arrest. Sheehan and Kelly also denied the charges brought against them, with Murray simply refusing to acknowledge or speak throughout the entire proceedings. (No direct evidence was offered to link Murray, Sheehan or Kelly with the Birmingham pub bombings. Nonetheless, the Crown alleged they were part of the same IRA unit as the Birmingham Six, and contended the Birmingham pub bombs may have been planted &quot;in some illogical way&quot; to avenge or commemorate the death of James McDade.)

The primary evidence presented against the Birmingham Six linking them to the Birmingham pub bombings were their written confessions, the Griess tests conducted by Frank Skuse at Morecambe police station, and circumstantial evidence indicative of Irish republican sympathies which would be supported by character witnesses called to testify on behalf of the prosecution.

Skuse testified as to his conducting Griess tests upon the hands of the six men following their arrest, stating as to his being 99% certain that both Hill and Power had handled explosive materials, and to a possibility Walker may also have done so. Skuse conceded that he could not rule out the possibility that Walker&#x27;s right hand could have been contaminated from his (Skuse&#x27;s) own hands, as Walker was the last of the five men to be swabbed at Morecambe police station, and had at first tested negative to the Griess test, before a second swab had revealed faint, positive traces of ammonium and nitrates. This testimony was refuted by Dr. Hugh Kenneth Black, a former Chief Inspector of Explosives for the Home Office, who testified that a range of innocuous substances and objects one could handle on a daily basis containing nitrocellulose (such as varnishes and paints) would produce a positive result to a Griess test. Moreover, the tests conducted by Skuse had not succeeded in identifying nitroglycerine as the source of the positive results produced by the Griess tests, and the Crown had earlier conceded that an exhaustive search of the six men&#x27;s homes had revealed no traces of nitroglycerine.

Several weeks into the trial, Judge Bridge overruled motions from the defence counsel that the four written confessions obtained from their clients should be omitted from evidence due to their being extorted under extreme physical and mental pressure, instead citing the statements as admissible evidence. These written confessions were presented in evidence at the trial following an eight-day hearing conducted without the presence of the jury. The judge refused to allow the jury to view the written confessions, which would have disclosed not only that each of the four written confessions contradicted details contained within the three other confessions, but that they also contradicted testimony from forensic scientists delivered earlier in the trial as to the devices used to conceal the bombs, and the locations in which they had been placed inside the public houses. For example, William Power had claimed in his written confession that he had placed the bomb which devastated the &quot;Mulberry Bush&quot; public house by a jukebox at the foot of a staircase to the premises; whereas a forensic scientist named Douglas Higgs had testified on the fourth day of the trial that the bomb which had detonated within these premises had been left by a wall located towards the rear of the premises.

====Conviction====
The trial lasted 45 days, and saw one hundred witnesses testify on behalf of the prosecution and defence. On 14 August 1975, the jury retired to consider their verdicts. These deliberations continued until the following day. On the afternoon of 15 August, having deliberated for over six-and-a-half hours, the jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts in relation to the 21 murder charges against the Birmingham Six. Upon passing sentence, Judge Nigel Bridge informed the defendants: &quot;You stand convicted of each of 21 counts, on the clearest and most overwhelming evidence I have ever heard, of the crime of murder.&quot; All six men were sentenced to life imprisonment. None of the Birmingham Six displayed any emotion upon hearing the verdict, although William Power saluted the judge.

At the same trial, Michael Murray and Michael Sheehan were each convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions and sentenced to nine years&#x27; imprisonment. James Kelly was found not guilty of conspiracy to cause explosions, but guilty of the possession of explosives and sentenced to one year&#x27;s imprisonment; his counsel, Edwin Jowett, successfully argued that his client had already served the equivalent of a one-year sentence, and he was released from prison on 23 August.

After sentencing all nine defendants, Judge Bridge summoned the Chief Constable of Lancashire and the Assistant Chief Constable of the West Midlands to hear a final address; both were commended for their collective efforts in interrogating and obtaining the four confessions presented in evidence. In addressing the defendants&#x27; assertions as to physical and psychological abuse while in the custody of both constabularies, Judge Bridge concluded: &quot;These investigations both at Morecambe and Birmingham were carried out with scrupulous propriety by all your officers&quot;.

===Appeals and independent reviews===
Following their conviction, the Birmingham Six continued to steadfastly maintain their innocence. All six men submitted an application to appeal their convictions; this motion was dismissed by the Court of Appeal in March 1976. Two years later, in November 1978, the Birmingham Six were granted legal aid to sue the Lancashire and West Midlands Police forces, and the Home Office, through the Court of Appeal in relation to the injuries they had suffered in custody. This motion to appeal their convictions on these grounds was challenged by the West Midlands Police, and was stricken by Lord Denning in January 1980, thereby thwarting the attempts of the men to find legal redress for their grievances via these grounds. The Birmingham Six were initially refused permission to further appeal against their convictions. The following year, Patrick Hill embarked on a month-long hunger strike in an unsuccessful bid to have his case reopened.

In 1982, Patrick Hill was visited by civil rights lawyer Gareth Peirce, who agreed to act on his behalf. Peirce also encouraged Hill and his co-accused to continue to compile evidence attesting to their innocence and to write to media personnel such as journalist Chris Mullin, and politicians such as Sir John Farr in an effort to garner support for a review of their case. Farr responded to this correspondence in March 1983, and later thoroughly reviewed all documents relating to the men&#x27;s conviction, concluding that the forensic evidence which existed against the six men was &quot;not worth the paper it was written on&quot;.

In 1985, the current affairs news programme &quot;World in Action&quot; presented the first of six episodes focusing upon the Birmingham pub bombings which seriously challenged the validity of the convictions of the six men. In this first episode broadcast, two distinguished forensic scientists conducted a series of Griess tests upon 35 separate common substances which the men had likely come into contact within their everyday lives.

Each forensic scientist confirmed that only substances containing nitrocellulose produced a positive result, and that the Griess test would only produce a positive reaction to nitrocellulose if conducted in a room at typical room temperature. When asked to comment on testimony delivered at the trial of the Birmingham Six, in which Dr. Skuse had stated that the temperature in a room in which the Griess test was conducted would need to be heated to 60 °C to produce a false positive reaction to nitrocellulose (thereby confusing the reading with nitroglycerine), one of the forensic scientists stated, &quot;Frankly, I was amazed.&quot;

Also appearing on this first &quot;World in Action&quot; episode broadcast was a former West Midlands policeman, who confirmed that each of the Birmingham Six had been subjected to beatings and threats while in the custody of the West Midlands Crime Squad. In addition, a former IRA Chief of Staff, Joe Cahill, on the same programme, acknowledged the IRA&#x27;s role in the Birmingham pub bombings.

In 1986, British Labour politician and journalist Chris Mullin published &quot;Error of Judgement: Truth About the Birmingham Bombings&quot;, which provided further evidence that the men had been wrongly convicted. The book included anonymous interviews with some of those who claimed to have been involved in the bombings, and who claimed the protocol 30-minute warning bomb warning had been delayed because the preselected telephone box had been vandalised, and that by the time another telephone box was found, the advance warning had been significantly delayed.

====1987 Court of Appeal hearing====
In January 1987, the Home Office referred the conviction of the Birmingham Six to the Court of Appeal. This motion resulted from the findings of forensic scientists working for the Home Office, who had expressed grave concerns as to the reliability of the Griess tests cited as forensic evidence of the defendants&#x27; guilt. In granting this motion, the Home Secretary himself emphasised that he had &quot;little or no confidence&quot; in the reliability of this test. This appeal was heard before three judges of the Court of Appeal in November 1987.

At this hearing, the defence counsels argued that the Birmingham Six were victims of a gross miscarriage of justice, that they had been convicted upon unreliable forensic evidence, and that the signed confessions were contradictory and had been obtained under extreme physical and mental duress. The allegations of physical mistreatment were corroborated by a former policeman named Thomas Clarke, who testified as to the defendants&#x27; mistreatment while incarcerated at Winson Green Prison.

This appeal also heard evidence from Mullin, who testified in detail as to the contradictions in the written and verbal confessions obtained from the defendants, both with regards to the events of the day, and with regards to the content of the statements made by their fellow defendants—all purported by the Crown to be solid evidence. Mullin also testified as to the fundamental flaws in the forensic tests conducted upon the men&#x27;s hands for traces of nitroglycerine.

This evidence was contradicted by Igor Judge, QC, who informed the three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Crown&#x27;s allegations that police had obtained false confessions by subjecting the men to severe physical and emotional abuse was &quot;baseless&quot;, and of his belief that only film footage of the defendants planting the bombs would provide stronger evidence than that which already existed against the Birmingham Six. On 28 January 1988, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales again upheld the convictions of the Birmingham Six as safe.

====Further media exposure====
In March 1990, ITV broadcast the Granada Television documentary drama, &quot;Who Bombed Birmingham?&quot;; a drama which recounted the events of the arrest of the Birmingham Six, the evidence presented at the trial and Mullins&#x27; then-ongoing efforts to prove Birmingham Six had been the victims of a miscarriage of justice. This documentary drama extensively detailed both the flaws in the forensic evidence against the men, and the extensive physical and psychological abuse to which they had been subjected. The programme named four of five members of the Provisional IRA as having organised and committed the Birmingham pub bombings.

One of these men was Mick Murray, who had been tried alongside the Birmingham Six and convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions. Murray was named as having assisted in the selection of the targets, and had later placed the advance warning call to the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; and &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot; newspapers, which was delayed by a half-hour due to the fact that the pre-selected telephone had been vandalised and another needed to be located, leading to the fateful delay in the warning calls. The other three named in the documentary were Seamus McLoughlin, whom the programme asserted had also planned the atrocities; James Francis Gavin (a.k.a. James Kelly, who had likewise been tried alongside the Birmingham Six and convicted of the possession of explosives), who had allegedly constructed each of the bombs; and Michael Christopher Hayes, who had planted the bombs at the preselected locations.

The executive producer of &quot;Who Bombed Birmingham?&quot;, Ray Fitzwalter, has stated that those involved in the production of this documentary drama are 100 percent certain that those named as the perpetrators of the Birmingham pub bombings had committed the atrocities.

===Release===

On 29 August 1990, as a result of further fresh evidence uncovered following the 1988 dismissal of appeal, the Home Secretary again referred the convictions of the Birmingham Six to the Court of Appeal. This appeal was heard by Lord Justice Lloyd between 4 and 14 March 1991. At the conclusion of this second appeal, the convictions of the Birmingham Six were quashed upon the bases of police fabrication of evidence, the suppression of evidence, and the unreliability of the scientific evidence presented at their 1975 trial. The tests conducted by Skuse upon the defendants&#x27; hands for nitroglycerine were deemed by the three Court of Appeal judges as being particularly unreliable and &quot;demonstrably wrong ... even by the state of forensic science in 1974&quot;.

The discrediting of this evidence was sufficient for the Crown to dismiss pleas from the prosecution to find the convictions &quot;unsatisfactory but not unsafe&quot;. On the afternoon of 14 March, Lord Justice Lloyd announced his intentions to withdraw the Crown&#x27;s case against the defendants. Upon announcing his intention to withdraw the convictions, Lord Justice Lloyd informed the Birmingham Six: &quot;In the light of the fresh evidence which has been made available since the last hearing in this court, your appeals will be allowed and you are free to go.&quot;

Emerging from the Old Bailey to an ecstatic public reception, each of the men addressed the press and public with varying statements including their concern for &quot;many more people—both Irish and English—still wrongfully behind bars&quot;.

In 2001, each of the Birmingham Six was subsequently paid between £840,000 and £1.2 million in compensation.

==Renewed inquests==

The West Midlands Police and then-Director of Public Prosecutions, Dame Barbara Mills, reopened their investigation into the Birmingham pub bombings following the release of the Birmingham Six. In April 1994, the Chief Constable of the West Midlands, Ron Hadfield, publicly stated: &quot;The file, so far as we are concerned is now closed ... We have done everything we could possibly have done to bring the perpetrators to justice&quot;. Hadfield then emphasised that the Director of Public Prosecutions had found &quot;insufficient evidence for [criminal] proceedings to be taken&quot;.

At the conclusion of the 1994 investigation, the Director of Public Prosecutions implemented a 75-year public-interest immunity certificate on documents relating to the Birmingham pub bombings—effectively preventing any release of documents relating to the reinvestigation until 2069. This court order forbids the disclosure of this evidence to the public on the grounds that any disclosure would be deemed to be damaging to the public interest.

On 1 June 2016, the senior coroner for Birmingham and Solihull, Louise Hunt, announced renewed inquests into the Birmingham pub bombings, citing two occasions where evidence clearly indicated the West Midlands Police had received a minimum of two advance warnings of the impending attacks at the two pubs—one of which had been made by known IRA members who had unequivocally stated on 10 November that Birmingham was to be &quot;hit next week&quot;. This conversation had been reported to police; no evidence is known to exist showing that the West Midlands Police had taken any effective responsive action to this threat. A second warning had been given to police on the day of the bombings, yet no action is known to have been taken.

Although Hunt states that any claims that police were/are protecting an IRA mole are unfounded, and that the response of emergency services on the night of the blasts did not in any way contribute to the deaths, in one section of her report, she states: &quot;I have serious concerns that advanced notice of the bombs may have been available to the police, and that they failed to take the necessary steps to protect public life.&quot;

In September 2018, the Lord Chief Justice ruled that any suspects in the bombings were not due to be named at upcoming inquests into the bombings, the judges present at the hearing having upheld an earlier coroner&#x27;s decision to omit issues pertaining to responsibility for the bombings in these inquests. The renewed inquests commenced on 11 February 2019.

With permission from the current head of the IRA, an individual known only as &quot;Witness O&quot; testified at this inquest on 22 March, naming four men (one of whom was Mick Murray) as responsible for the bombings. He also testified as to his belief that security services had been given adequate time to evacuate both pubs. On 5 April, the jury of 11 found that a botched advance IRA telephone warning contributed to or caused the 21 deaths and that there had been no error or omission in the police response to the given warning call which might have limited the loss of life.

==Independent campaign==

In 2011, Brian and Julie Hambleton, who lost their 18-year-old sister Maxine in the &quot;Tavern in the Town&quot; explosion, initiated a campaign called &quot;Justice for the 21&quot;. The stated aims of this campaign are to highlight and resolve the fact that, although the inquiry is officially an open one, no efforts are being made to actively pursue the perpetrators of the Birmingham pub bombings unless significant new leads are to surface, and to resolve the issue that the families of the 21 victims have never seen true justice for the loss of their loved ones. &quot;Justice for the 21&quot; wants to see the criminal investigation into the bombings reopened and the perpetrators brought to justice or, if deceased, publicly named. When asked in 2012 why she and her brother had instigated this campaign, Julie Hambleton stated: &quot;Someone has to fight for them; someone has to speak on their behalf, because they&#x27;re not here to do it themselves ... It doesn&#x27;t matter how much time has passed.&quot;

Campaigners for &quot;Justice for the 21&quot; believe they have amassed evidence indicating that a British double agent was part of an IRA unit that had committed the pub bombings.

Following a 2014 meeting held at the West Midlands Police headquarters to discuss the findings of a two-year reassessment of all available evidence connected with the original 1974 inquiry, campaigners within &quot;Justice for the 21&quot; were informed that unless &quot;new and significant information&quot; was forthcoming, there would be no further inquiry into the Birmingham pub bombings. At this meeting, the Chief Constable of the West Midlands informed the campaigners that 35 pieces of evidence from the original 1974 inquiry were now missing, including the bomb which had been discovered at Hagley Road and safely destroyed in a controlled explosion.

In November 2014, the &quot;Justice for the 21&quot; campaign implemented a fresh petition to pressure the British Government to form a new inquiry into the Birmingham pub bombings. This petition was signed by four retired West Midlands Police officers, and by Patrick Hill, who wrote of his desire that a fresh inquiry would &quot;establish the true circumstances of the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings, and to order the release of all government, police, and Crown papers related to the case in order to bring truth and justice for the 21 innocent people who died, the 182 people who were injured, for the six innocent men who were wrongfully convicted, and for the families of all those affected.&quot;

Patrick Hill has publicly backed the efforts of the &quot;Justice for the 21&quot; campaign, and would later state that, following their 1991 release from prison, the Birmingham Six had been informed of the names of the true perpetrators of the Birmingham pub bombings and that their identities are known among the upper echelons of both the IRA and the British government. Hill stated that, following the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, he has been told that five members of the Provisional IRA have admitted to committing the Birmingham pub bombings, relying on a clause in the Good Friday Agreement offering immunity from prosecution. Two of these men have since died and a further two have been promised immunity, whereas a fifth man reportedly had not received any such assurances.

==Aftermath==

* In the weeks and months following the Birmingham pub bombings, Birmingham&#x27;s Irish community experienced ostracism, assault and abuse. As a result of these tensions, any public celebrations of Irish culture, including the annual St Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, were cancelled. Tensions created in the wake of the bombings would take more than a decade to heal.
* In 1983, the Director of the Birmingham Irish Welfare and Information Centre, Rev. Joe Taaffe, reinstated Birmingham&#x27;s annual St Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, with a message that the Irish community in Birmingham should again unashamedly celebrate their heritage without fear of reprisal. Birmingham&#x27;s annual St Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade is considered to be the world&#x27;s third largest St Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, with annual attendance figures reaching or surpassing 130,000.

* Following his release from prison in 1991, Patrick Hill co-founded of the &quot;Miscarriages of Justice Organisation&quot;; a group whose dual aims are to provide and improve emotional and physical support for those found to have been wrongly convicted once released from prison, and to provide advocacy for those still inside prison who proclaim their innocence. Patrick Hill and the families of those killed in the Birmingham pub bombings remain united in their efforts to overturn the 75-year public interest immunity order imposed in 1994, and have publicly demanded the British Government order the release of all government, police, and crown papers related to the case. In reference to the public interest immunity order, a spokeswoman for the &quot;Justice for the 21&quot; campaign group commented in 2014:

* In 2004, civil rights campaigner and Catholic priest the Rev. Denis Faul (who had previously campaigned for the release of the Birmingham Six) officially called on the IRA to both admit their culpability in the Birmingham pub bombings, and to apologise. These calls were echoed by Sinn Féin, who stated: &quot;What happened in Birmingham 30 years ago was wrong and should not have happened&quot;, adding &quot;[if] issues relating to the IRA concerning the Birmingham bombings are still to be addressed, then it is very clearly the Sinn Féin position that this should happen&quot;.
* In 2014, the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; named Michael Murray as the mastermind behind the Birmingham pub bombings. Murray was an admitted member of the Provisional IRA who held a high rank within the Birmingham IRA unit; he had been arrested just four days after the Birmingham pub bombings and had stood trial alongside the Birmingham Six, and although charged only with conspiracy to cause explosions, the prosecutor had suggested Murray may have been the mastermind behind the bombings. Prior to his 1975 trial, Murray had been convicted of separate charges of conspiracy to cause explosions and with causing an explosion.
* The &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; alleges Murray had assisted in the construction of the bombs at a house in Bordesley Green, and had then transported them to the city centre, where he had handed them to another person, who then placed them in the preselected targets, before Murray telephoned the delayed warning calls to the two Birmingham newspapers. These allegations are supported by Patrick Hill and John Walker, who remain adamant that at one stage during the 1975 trial, Murray had privately admitted being one of the bombers. Murray allegedly told the two men: &quot;I&#x27;m very sorry to see yous in here. Nothing went right that night. The first telephone box we got to was out of order&quot;, before threatening the two men that if they ever divulged this admission, both they and their families would be attacked.
* Mick Murray never admitted his alleged involvement in the Birmingham pub bombings. Following his release from prison, he remained active within the Provisional IRA, and later became a vocal opponent of the decommissioning in Northern Ireland as part of the Northern Ireland peace process. He died of a heart attack in County Tipperary in 1999.
* Kieran Conway, a former senior officer of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, admitted in 2014 the PIRA had committed the Birmingham pub bombings, adding that he was &quot;appalled and ashamed&quot; at the attack, and that other senior IRA officials shared his opinion the bombings had been immoral and detrimental to the objectives of the republican movement. Conway, however, disputed allegations that an insufficient warning had deliberately been given to security services due to ill-feeling within the IRA over the disrupted funeral arrangements for James McDade, but claimed the perpetrators had tried to use several phone boxes which were either out of order or in use to deliver the protocol 30-minute warning, before finding a free, operable phone box to deliver the warning call.
* On 10 July 2017, BBC Northern Ireland radio released an interview with Michael Christopher Hayes, a self-confessed bomb maker active within the Birmingham IRA unit in the 1970s. In this interview, Hayes (who had been named as a perpetrator of the bombings in the 1990 Granada documentary drama &quot;Who Bombed Birmingham?&quot;) stated he took &quot;collective responsibility&quot; for the bombings, although he refused to name who had planted the bombs in each of the locations. Nonetheless, he did state: &quot;We were horrified when we heard, because it was not intended. I personally defused the third bomb. It was not the intention of the IRA to kill innocent people ... It wouldn&#x27;t have been done if that was the case.&quot;

* On 18 November 2020, a 65-year-old man was arrested in Belfast under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 in connection with the bombings. He was released the following day without charge.

==Memorials==
A memorial plaque for the victims stands in the grounds of Birmingham&#x27;s Saint Philip&#x27;s Cathedral. This plaque is engraved with the names of the 21 people killed in the Birmingham pub bombings, and bears the inscription: &quot;The people of Birmingham remember them and those who suffered.&quot;

A memorial commemorating those lost and wounded in the Birmingham pub bombings was unveiled on 21 November 2018. Commissioned by the Birmingham Irish Association and designed by a local artist named Anuradha Patel, this memorial consists of three steel trees, and is located outside the city&#x27;s New Street Station.

Several survivors and relatives of those killed in the Birmingham pub bombings have visited the Glencree Centre for Peace and Reconciliation in the Republic of Ireland in an effort to come to terms with the events of 21 November 1974. The Glencree Centre is a charitable organisation whose stated aim is to promote peace and reconciliation in Britain and Ireland as a response to the Troubles. One of those who has visited the Glencree Centre, Maureen Carlin (who survived the &quot;Mulbery Bush&quot; bombing), said in 2009 that she had spoken with two former IRA members, who referred to the Birmingham pub bombings as a mistake for which the IRA would never publicly admit responsibility.

==Media==
===Film===
The made-for-TV film &quot;Who Bombed Birmingham?&quot; was first broadcast in 1990. Directed by Mike Beckham, the film is directly inspired by the painstaking efforts of then-journalist Chris Mullin to prove the six men convicted of the bombing had been the victims of a miscarriage of justice, as detailed in his 1986 book &quot;Error of Judgement: The Truth about the Birmingham Bombings&quot;. The film casts John Hurt as Mullin and Martin Shaw as Granada Television &quot;World in Action&quot; producer and fellow researcher Ian McBride, as they investigate the convictions of the &quot;Birmingham Six.&quot;

* The BBC have commissioned a 30-minute documentary focusing upon the Birmingham pub bombings. This documentary, &quot;Who Murdered Maxine?&quot;, was first broadcast in December 2013 and focuses upon the ongoing campaign by relatives of one of those killed in the Birmingham pub bombings, Maxine Hambleton, to reopen the investigation into the bombings and their ongoing efforts to raise public awareness of their campaign.

<text>John Covode (March 17, 1808 – January 11, 1871) was an American businessman and abolitionist politician. He served three terms in the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.

==Early life==
Covode was born in Fairfield Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. He worked for several years on his father&#x27;s farm, served an apprenticeship to a blacksmith, and then was employed at a woolen mill in Lockport, Pennsylvania. He became owner of the woolen mill and attained considerable wealth as a woolen manufacturer. Other business interests included the Westmoreland Coal Company, where he served as the first president of the company in 1854. He served for two terms in the Pennsylvania Legislature(House of Representatives). Two attempts to enter the Pennsylvania Senate were unsuccessful.

==United States House of Representatives==
In 1854, he was elected to Congress as an Opposition Party candidate.

After joining the Republican Party, he was re-elected to the 35th Congress in 1856. He was a strong supporter of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and the Reconstruction Acts. He attended the Union National Convention in Philadelphia in 1866. On February 21, 1868, Covode introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives to impeach President Andrew Johnson. A slightly-amended version of this resolution, was passed by the House on February 24, 1868, thereby impeaching Johnson, but the Senate did not vote to convict him in his impeachment trial.

===Committees===
He served as chairman of the United States House Committee on Public Expenditures from 1857 until 1859 and the United States House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds from 1867 until 1869. He also served on the United States Congressional Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, in reference to the American Civil War.

====Covode Committee====
Covode is most famous for chairing a committee to investigate the possibility of impeaching President James Buchanan during the spring and summer of 1860. Officially titled the United States House Select Committee to Investigate Alleged Corruptions in Government, it is more popularly known as the Covode Committee after him.

===United States House election, 1870===
Covode contested with Henry D. Foster the election to the Forty-first Congress, neither being sworn pending the contest, as no credentials were issued by the Governor. On February 9, 1870, the House declared him duly elected, whereupon he qualified and served until his death. Covode died in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, aged 62.

==Family==
His oldest son, George H. Covode (1835–1864), was a colonel in the Union Army during the Civil War. He died on June 25, 1864, after being shot in the arm and stomach by Confederate troops he had mistaken for Unionists.

<text>Hans Makart (28 May 1840 – 3 October 1884) was a 19th-century Austrian academic history painter, designer, and decorator. Makart was a prolific painter whose ideas significantly influenced the development of visual art in Austria-Hungary, Germany, and beyond. 

==Life==

Makart was the son of a chamberlain at the Mirabell Palace, born in the former residence of the prince-archbishops of Salzburg, the city in which Mozart had been born. Initially, he received his training in painting at the Vienna Academy between 1850 and 1851 from Johann Fischbach. While in the Academy, German art was under the rule of a classicism, which was entirely intellectual and academic—clear and precise drawing, sculpturesque modelling, and pictorial erudition were esteemed above all. Makart, who was a poor draughtsman, but who had a passionate and sensual love of color, was impatient to escape the routine of art school drawing. For his fortune, he was found by his instructors to be devoid of all talent and forced to leave the Vienna Academy.
He went to Munich, and after two years of independent study attracted the attention of Karl Theodor von Piloty, under whose guidance, between 1861 and 1865 he developed his painting style. During these years, Makart also travelled to London, Paris and Rome to further his studies. The first picture he painted under Piloty, &quot;Lavoisier in Prison&quot;, though it was considered timid and conventional, attracted attention by its sense of color. In his next work, &quot;The Knight and the Water Nymphs&quot;, he first displayed the decorative qualities to which he afterwards sacrificed everything else in his work. His fame became established in the next year, with two works, &quot;Modern Amoretti&quot; and &quot;The Plague in Florence&quot;. His painting &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was soon after bought by the Austrian emperor for the Vienna Museum, and Makart was invited to come to Vienna by the aristocracy.

The prince Von Hohenlohe provided Makart with an old foundry at the Gusshausstraße 25 to use as a studio. He gradually turned it into an impressive place full of sculptures, flowers, musical instruments, requisites and jewellery that he used to create classical settings for his portraits, mainly of women. Eventually his studio looked like a salon and became a social meeting point in Vienna. Cosima Wagner described it as a &quot;wonder of decorative beauty, a sublime lumber-room&quot;. His luxurious studio served as a model for a great many upper middle-class living rooms.
The opulent, semi-public spaces of the Makart were the scene of a recurring rendezvous between the artist and his public. Makart became the mediator between different levels of society: he created a socially ambiguous sphere in which nobility and bourgeoisie could encounter one another in mutual veneration of the master, and aestheticized the burgeoning self-awareness of the bourgeoisie by means of historical models drawn from the world of the aristocracy. In this way, an artist like Makart lived out the image that high society had created of him.
Makart became the acknowledged leader of the artistic life of Vienna, which in the 1870s passed through a period of feverish activity. A chief result of this activity are the sumptuously decorated public buildings of the Ringstraße. He not only practised painting, but was also an interior designer, costume designer, furniture designer, and decorator, and his work decorated most of the public spaces of the era. His work engendered the term &quot;Makartstil&quot;, or &quot;Makart style&quot;, which completely characterized the era.

In 1879, Makart designed a pageant organised to celebrate the Silver Wedding Anniversary of the Imperial couple, emperor Franz Joseph I and his wife Elisabeth of Bavaria —he designed, single-handedly, the costumes, scenic setting, and triumphal cars. This became known as the &quot;Makart-parade&quot;, and gave the people of Vienna the chance to dress up in historical costumes and be transported back into the past for a few hours. At the head of the parade was a float for artists, led by Makart on a white horse. His festivals became an institution in Vienna which lasted up until the 1960s. In the same year of the first parade, Makart became a Professor at the Vienna Academy.
Makart&#x27;s painting &quot;The Entry of Charles V into Antwerp&quot; caused some controversy, because Charles V was depicted arriving in a procession surrounded by nude virgins (it was considered offensive to include nudes in such a relatively modern scene). In the United States, the painting fell under the proscription of Anthony Comstock, which secured Makart&#x27;s fame there. The American public desired at once to see what Comstock was persecuting, so they could tell whether he was acting correctly or in error.

In 1882, emperor Franz Joseph I ordered the building of the Villa Hermes at Lainz (near Vienna) for his empress and specified the bedroom decoration to be inspired from Shakespeare&#x27;s Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream. Makart designed for him a dreamworld decoration as a large painting (1882) that is still extant. Unfortunately his design was never executed after his early death in 1884. His collection of antiques and art consisted of 1083 pieces and was put up for auction by art-dealer Hugo Othmar Miethke.
Salzburg&#x27;s Makart Square, or Makartplatz, was named after the painter.

==Art==

The &quot;Makartstil&quot;, which determined the culture of an entire era in Vienna, was an aestheticism the likes of which hadn&#x27;t been seen before him and has not been replicated to this day. Called the &quot;magician of colors&quot;, he painted in brilliant colors and fluid forms, which placed the design and the aesthetic of the work before all else. Often to heighten the strength of his colors he introduced asphalt into his paint, which has led to some deterioration in his paintings over the years. The paintings were usually large-scale and theatrical productions of historical motifs. Works such as &quot;The Papal Election&quot; reveal Makart&#x27;s skill in the bold use of color to convey drama as well as his later developed virtuoso draughtsmanship.

Makart was deeply interested in the interaction of all the visual arts and thus in the implementation of the idea of the &quot;total work of art&quot; which dominated discussions on the arts in the 19th century. This was the ideal which he realised in magnificent festivities which he organised and centred on himself. The 1879 Makart-parade was the culmination of these endeavors. Makart was also a friend of the composer Richard Wagner, and it can be argued that the two developed the same concepts and stylistic tendencies in their differing art forms: a concern for embedding motifs of history and mythology in a framework of aestheticism, making their respective works historical pageants.

Makart&#x27;s work, like those of other academic artists of the time, consisted of allegorical painting and history painting as seen in &quot;Catherina Carnaro&quot;, &quot;Dianas Hunt&quot;, &quot;The Entry of Charles V into Antwerp&quot;, &quot;Abundantia&quot; , &quot;Spring&quot;, &quot;Summer&quot;, &quot;The Death of Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;The Five Senses&quot;, and &quot;Bacchus and Ariadne&quot;. He was considered the Austrian rival to the French William-Adolphe Bouguereau. Within Austria, his nearest competitor was considered to be Hans Canon, and he was associated with the sculptor Viktor Tilgner, who travelled with him to Italy.

==Influence==

Aside from his clear influence on the academic art and high culture of Vienna at the time, Makart also influenced a range of painters and decorators who followed him, including many who rebelled against his style—the most notable being Gustav Klimt, who is said to have idolized him. Klimt&#x27;s early style is based in historicism and has clear similarities to Makart&#x27;s paintings. The entire decorative focus of the Secession, the Austrian Art Nouveau of which Klimt was a part, arose in an environment in which Makart had put the decorative aspects of art in the forefront. Some have also suggested that primacy of sexual symbolism in Art Nouveau artworks were influenced by the sensuality in many of Makart&#x27;s paintings.

<text>HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) is a zwitterionic sulfonic acid buffering agent. It is one of the twenty Good&#x27;s buffers. HEPES is widely used in cell culture, largely because it is better at maintaining physiological pH despite changes in carbon dioxide concentration (produced by aerobic respiration) when compared to bicarbonate buffers, which are also commonly used in cell culture. Lepe-Zuniga &quot;et al.&quot; reported an unwanted photochemical process wherein HEPES catalyzes a reaction with riboflavin when exposed to ambient light to produce hydrogen peroxide. This is not a problem in bicarbonate-based cell culture buffers. It is therefore strongly advised to keep solutions containing both HEPES and riboflavin in darkness as much as possible to prevent oxidation. 

HEPES has the following characteristics: 
* p&quot;K&quot;a1 (25 °C) = 3
* p&quot;K&quot;a2 (25 °C) = 7.5
* Useful pH range = 2.5 to 3.5 or 6.8 to 8.2

HEPES has negligible metal ion binding, making it a good choice as a buffer for enzymes which might be inhibited by metal chelation.

<doc id="379957" wikidata="Q719179" url="?curid=379957" title="Lateral geniculate nucleus">
<text>In neuroanatomy, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN; also called the lateral geniculate body or lateral geniculate complex) is a structure in the thalamus and a key component of the mammalian visual pathway. It is a small, ovoid, ventral projection of the thalamus where the thalamus connects with the optic nerve. There are two LGNs, one on the left and another on the right side of the thalamus. In humans, both LGNs have six layers of neurons (grey matter) alternating with optic fibers (white matter).

The LGN receives information directly from the ascending retinal ganglion cells via the optic tract and from the reticular activating system. Neurons of the LGN send their axons through the optic radiation, a direct pathway to the primary visual cortex. In addition, the LGN receives many strong feedback connections from the primary visual cortex. In humans as well as other mammals, the two strongest pathways linking the eye to the brain are those projecting to the dorsal part of the LGN in the thalamus, and to the superior colliculus.

==Structure==

Both the left and right hemispheres of the brain have a lateral geniculate nucleus, named after its resemblance to a bent knee (&quot;genu&quot; is Latin for &quot;knee&quot;). In humans as well as in many other primates, the LGN has layers of magnocellular cells and parvocellular cells that are interleaved with layers of koniocellular cells.

In humans the LGN is normally described as having six distinctive layers. The inner two layers, (1 and 2) are magnocellular layers, while the outer four layers, (3, 4, 5 and 6), are parvocellular layers. An additional set of neurons, known as the koniocellular layers, are found ventral to each of the magnocellular and parvocellular layers. This layering is variable between primate species, and extra leafleting is variable within species.

The average volume of each LGN in an adult human is about 118mmformula_1. (This is the same volume as a 4.9mm-sided cube.) A study of 24 hemispheres from 15 normal individuals with average age 59 years at autopsy found variation from about 91 to 157mmformula_1. The same study found that in each LGN, the magnocellular layers comprised about 28mmformula_1 in total, and the parvocellular layers comprised about 90mmformula_1 in total.

==M, P, K cells==

*Size describes the cell body and dendritic tree, though also can describe the receptive field

The magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular layers of the LGN correspond with the similarly named types of retinal ganglion cells. Retinal P ganglion cells send axons to a parvocellular layer, M ganglion cells send axons to a magnocellular layer, and K ganglion cells send axons to a koniocellular layer.

Koniocellular cells are functionally and neurochemically distinct from M and P cells and provide a third channel to the visual cortex. They project their axons between the layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus where M and P cells project. Their role in visual perception is presently unclear; however, the koniocellular system has been linked with the integration of somatosensory system-proprioceptive information with visual perception, and it may also be involved in color perception.

The parvo- and magnocellular fibers were previously thought to dominate the Ungerleider–Mishkin ventral stream and dorsal stream, respectively. However, new evidence has accumulated showing that the two streams appear to feed on a more even mixture of different types of nerve fibers.

The other major retino–cortical visual pathway is the tectopulvinar pathway, routing primarily through the superior colliculus and thalamic pulvinar nucleus onto posterior parietal cortex and visual area MT.

==Ipsilateral and contralateral layers==
Both the LGN in the right hemisphere and the LGN in the left hemisphere receive input from each eye. However, each LGN only receives information from one half of the visual field. Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from the inner halves of each retina (the nasal sides) decussate (cross to the other side of the brain) through the optic chiasma (&quot;khiasma&quot; means &quot;cross-shaped&quot;). RGCs from the outer half of each retina (the temporal sides) remain on the same side of the brain. Therefore, the right LGN receives visual information from the left visual field, and the left LGN receives visual information from the right visual field. Within one LGN, the visual information is divided among the various layers as follows:
* the eye on the same side (the &quot;ipsilateral&quot; eye) sends information to layers 2, 3 and 5
* the eye on the opposite side (the &quot;contralateral&quot; eye) sends information to layers 1, 4 and 6.

This description applies to the LGN of many primates, but not all. The sequence of layers receiving information from the ipsilateral and contralateral (opposite side of the head) eyes is different in the tarsier. Some neuroscientists suggested that &quot;this apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, reinforcing the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution&quot;.

== Input ==
The LGN receives input from the retina and many other brain structures, especially visual cortex.

The principal neurons in the LGN receive strong inputs from the retina. However, the retina only accounts for a small percentage of LGN input. As much as 95% of input in the LGN comes from the visual cortex, superior colliculus, pretectum, thalamic reticular nuclei, and local LGN interneurons. Regions in the brainstem that are not involved in visual perception also project to the LGN, such as the mesencephalic reticular formation, dorsal raphe nucleus, periaqueuctal grey matter, and the locus coeruleus. The LGN also receives some inputs from the optic tectum (known as the superior colliculus in mammals). These non-retinal inputs can be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory.

== Output ==
Information leaving the LGN travels out on the optic radiations, which form part of the &quot;retrolenticular portion&quot; of the internal capsule.

The axons that leave the LGN go to V1 visual cortex. Both the magnocellular layers 1–2 and the parvocellular layers 3–6 send their axons to layer 4 in V1. Within layer 4 of V1, layer 4cβ receives parvocellular input, and layer 4cα receives magnocellular input. However, the koniocellular layers, intercalated between LGN layers 1–6 send their axons primarily to the cytochrome-oxidase rich blobs of layers 2 and 3 in V1. Axons from layer 6 of visual cortex send information back to the LGN.

Studies involving blindsight have suggested that projections from the LGN travel not only to the primary visual cortex but also to higher cortical areas V2 and V3. Patients with blindsight are phenomenally blind in certain areas of the visual field corresponding to a contralateral lesion in the primary visual cortex; however, these patients are able to perform certain motor tasks accurately in their blind field, such as grasping. This suggests that neurons travel from the LGN to both the primary visual cortex and higher cortex regions.

==Function in visual perception==
The output of the LGN serves several functions.

Computations are achieved to determine the position of every major element in object space relative to the principal plane. Through subsequent motion of the eyes, a larger stereoscopic mapping of the visual field is achieved.

It has been shown that while the retina accomplishes spatial decorrelation through center surround inhibition, the LGN accomplishes temporal decorrelation. This spatial–temporal decorrelation makes for much more efficient coding. However, there is almost certainly much more going on.

Like other areas of the thalamus, particularly other &quot;relay nuclei&quot;, the LGN likely helps the visual system focus its attention on the most important information. That is, if you hear a sound slightly to your left, the auditory system likely &quot;tells&quot; the visual system, through the LGN via its surrounding peri-reticular nucleus, to direct visual attention to that part of space. The LGN is also a station that refines certain receptive fields.

Axiomatically determined functional models of LGN cells have been determined by Lindeberg in terms of Laplacian of Gaussian kernels over the spatial domain in combination with temporal derivatives of either non-causal or time-causal scale-space kernels over the temporal domain. It has been shown that this theory both leads to predictions about receptive fields with good qualitative agreement with the biological receptive field measurements performed by DeAngelis et al. and guarantees good theoretical properties of the mathematical receptive field model, including covariance and invariance properties under natural image transformations. Specifically according to this theory, non-lagged LGN cells correspond to first-order temporal derivatives, whereas lagged LGN cells correspond to second-order temporal derivatives.

===Color processing===

The LGN is integral in the early steps of color processing, where opponent channels are created that compare signals between the different Photoreceptor cell types. The output of P-cells comprises red-green opponent signals. The output of M-cells does not include much color opponency, rather a sum of the red-green signal that evokes luminance. The output of K-cells comprises mostly blue-yellow opponent signals.

==Rodents==

In rodents, the lateral geniculate nucleus contains the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN), and the region in between called the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL). These are distinct subcortical nuclei with differences in function.

===dLGN===

The dorsolateral geniculate nucleus is the main division of the lateral geniculate body. In the mouse, the area of the dLGN is about 0.48mmformula_5. The majority of input to the dLGN comes from the retina. It is laminated and shows retinotopic organization.

===vLGN===

The ventrolateral geniculate nucleus has been found to be relatively large in several species such as lizards, rodents, cows, cats, and primates. An initial cytoarchitectural scheme, which has been confirmed in several studies, suggests that the vLGN is divided into two parts. The external and internal divisions are separated by a group of fine fibers and a zone of thinly dispersed neurons. Additionally, several studies have suggested further subdivisions of the vLGN in other species. For example, studies indicate that the cytoarchitecture of the vLGN in the cat differs from rodents. Although five subdivisions of the vLGN in the cat have been identified by some, the scheme that divides the vLGN into three regions (medial, intermediate, and lateral) has been more widely accepted.

===IGL===

The intergeniculate leaflet is a relatively small area found dorsal to the vLGN. Earlier studies had referred to the IGL as the internal dorsal division of the vLGN. Several studies have described homologous regions in several species, including humans.

The vLGN and IGL appear to be closely related based on similarities in neurochemicals, inputs and outputs, and physiological properties.

The vLGN and IGL have been reported to share many neurochemicals that are found concentrated in the cells, including neuropeptide Y, GABA, encephalin, and nitric oxide synthase. The neurochemicals serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline have been found in the fibers of these nuclei.

Both the vLGN and IGL receive input from the retina, locus coreuleus, and raphe. Other connections that have been found to be reciprocal include the superior colliculus, pretectum, and hypothalamus, as well as other thalamic nuclei.

Physiological and behavioral studies have shown spectral-sensitive and motion-sensitive responses that vary with species. The vLGN and IGL seem to play an important role in mediating phases of the circadian rhythms that are not involved with light, as well as phase shifts that are light-dependent.

<text>A giant depolarizing potential (GDP) is a type of patterned spontaneous activity that can be observed in preparations of developing brain at early stages of development. These patterns of activity differ a lot from both the adult brain activity, and epileptiform activity. In humans they exist only on prenatal stages, in rats they last for approximately P6.

GDPs were postulated to be essential for the establishment and maturation of synaptic connections in the immature brain .

One of the main conditions for GDP development (that is met in premature but not adult brain) is that GABA action on these stages should be excitatory rather than inhibitory. This is caused by a much higher concentration of Cl− concentration in the cytoplasm of neonatal neurons. Further, the expression of the chloride transporter, KCC2, is less in immature neurons, as a result of which there is the above-mentioned high intracellular chloride. On receiving a GABAergic stimulus, there is an efflux of Chloride from the cell, resulting in depolarization of the cell. This causes the GDPs. Once the KCC2 expression is relatively high, as in the adult, mature neurons, the GDPs almost simultaneously disappear. The increased level of KCC2 expression in adult, mature neurons alone is not the reason for the disappearance of the GDPs, however.

<doc id="379963" wikidata="Q7253161" url="?curid=379963" title="Prussian Homage">
<text>The Prussian Homage or Prussian Tribute (; ) was the formal investiture of Albert, Duke of Prussia (1490-1568), with his Duchy of Prussia as a fief of the Kingdom of Poland that took place on 10 April 1525 in the then capital of Kraków, Kingdom of Poland. This ended the rule of the Teutonic Order in Prussia, which became a secular Protestant state.

Fighting in the Thirteen Years War of 1454-1466 and the Polish-Teutonic War (1519-1521) ended with an armistice. A year later in 1522, Albert, also the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and a member of the Royal dynasty of the House of Hohenzollern, became a Protestant, as did many other members of the Teutonic Order and Prussian nobles
at the suggestion of Dr. Martin Luther (1483-1546), to Albert. 

Luther was a former Roman Catholic priest, continued as a theological professor at the University of Wittenberg in the town of Wittenberg, Saxony and a monk in the Augustinian religious order. A reformer, author and eventual leader of Evangelical Lutheranism, espousing doctrine and theology since 1517, along with gathering many other supporters among laity, clergy, academics, and nobility, initiating the beginnings of Evangelical. He debated / argued with other reformers such as Swiss theologian Ulrich Zwingli, French / Swiss John Calvin or John Knox in the Kingdom of Scotland on their slightly different emphases of Reformed / Calvinism / Presbyterianism movements in the larger Protestantism of the Reformation in Western Christianity during the 16th century. 

Albert agreed that Prussia should submit to Poland and become officially a Protestant state. King Sigismund I the Old of Poland (1467-1548, reigned 1506-1548), (who happened to be Albert&#x27;s uncle) accepted this, because it was better for Poland for strategic reasons rather than have the independent State of the Teutonic Order in Prussia, formally subject to the Holy Roman Empire in Central Europe and Germany and its Emperor and the bishops of the Roman Catholic Church and the Papacy in Rome. 

These terms were included in the Treaty of Kraków, which officially ended the Polish–Teutonic War on 8 April 1525. A week later, on 10 April, in the Main Square of the then Polish capital Kraków, Albert resigned as Grand Master and received the title &quot;Duke of Prussia&quot; from Polish King Sigismund. Thus the Duchy of Prussia became the first Protestant state, anticipating the terms three decades later of the Peace of Augsburg of 1555. 

As a symbol of vassalage, Albert received a standard with the Prussian coat of arms from the Polish king. The black Prussian eagle on the flag was augmented with a letter &quot;S&quot; (for Sigismundus) and had a crown placed around its neck as a symbol of fealty to Poland.

== Earlier homages of Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights ==
The tradition of &quot;Prussian Homages&quot; dates back to the year 1469, when, after the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–66) and the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), each new Grand Master was obliged to pay homage to Polish rulers within six months of his election. Some Grand Masters refused to do so, claiming that the Order was under Papal sovereignty. Among those who refused were Martin Truchseß von Wetzhausen, Frederick of Saxony (who referred the matter to the 1495 Imperial Diet), and Albert. Five Grand Masters did comply:
* 1 December 1469, at a Sejm in Piotrków Trybunalski, Grand Master Heinrich Reuß von Plauen paid homage to King Casimir IV Jagiellon.
* 20 November 1470, at a Sejm in Piotrków Trybunalski, Grand Master Heinrich Reffle von Richtenberg and Conrad Von Wilczyński paid homage to King Casimir IV.
* 9 October 1479, at Nowy Korczyn, Grand Master Martin Truchseß von Wetzhausen paid homage to King Casimir IV.
* 18 November 1489, at Radom, Grand Master Johann von Tiefen paid homage to King Casimir IV.
* 29 May 1493, Grand Master Johann von Tiefen paid homage to King John I Albert.

== Subsequent homages of Dukes of Prussia ==
The Duchy of Prussia was created in 1525, and the homage of Duke Albert of Prussia took place on 10 April 1525 at Kraków. The last homage took place on 6 October 1641 in front of the Royal Castle, Warsaw. Following the Treaty of Bromberg (1657), Prussian rulers were no longer regarded as vassals of Polish kings.
* 19 July 1569, at a Sejm in Lublin, Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia, paid homage to King Sigismund II Augustus. This event was observed, among others, by Jan Kochanowski, who described it in the poem &quot;Proporzec albo hołd pruski&quot;.
* 20 February 1578, in front of St. Anne&#x27;s Church, Warsaw, George Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, paid homage to King Stephen Báthory.
* 16 November 1611, in front of St. Anne&#x27;s Church, Warsaw, John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg, paid homage to King Sigismund III Vasa.
* September 1621, George William, Elector of Brandenburg, paid homage to King Sigismund III.
* 21 March 1633, envoys of Elector George William paid homage to King Władysław IV Vasa.
* 6 October 1641, in front of Warsaw&#x27;s Royal Castle, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, paid homage to King Władysław IV.

<doc id="379967" wikidata="Q749115" url="?curid=379967" title="Postpartum period">
<text>The postpartum (or postnatal) period begins after childbirth and is typically considered to last for six to eight weeks. There are three distinct phases of the postnatal period; the acute phase, lasting for six to twelve hours after birth; the subacute phase, lasting six weeks; and the delayed phase, lasting up to six months. During the delayed phase, some changes to the genitourinary system take much longer to resolve and may result in conditions such as urinary incontinence. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes the postnatal period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies. Most maternal and newborn deaths occur during this period.

In scientific literature, the term is commonly abbreviated to P&quot;x, where x&quot; is a number; for example, &quot;day P5&quot; should be read as &quot;the fifth day after birth&quot;. This is not to be confused with the medical nomenclature that uses G P to stand for number and outcomes of pregnancy (gravidity and parity).

A woman giving birth may leave as soon as she is medically stable, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum, though the average for a vaginal birth is one to two days. The average caesarean section postnatal stay is three to four days. During this time, the mother is monitored for bleeding, bowel and bladder function, and baby care. The infant&#x27;s health is also monitored. Early postnatal hospital discharge is typically defined as discharge of the mother and newborn from the hospital within 48 hours of birth.

The postpartum period can be divided into three distinct stages; the initial or acute phase, 8–19 hours after childbirth; subacute postpartum period, which lasts two to six weeks, and the delayed postpartum period, which can last up to six months. In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem. Long-term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.

Various organizations recommend routine postpartum evaluation at certain time intervals in the postpartum period.

== Acute phase ==
The first 6 to 12 hours after childbirth is the initial or acute phase of the postpartum period. During this time the mother is typically monitored by nurses or midwives as complications can arise.

The greatest health risk in the acute phase is postpartum bleeding. Following delivery the area where the placenta was attached to the uterine wall bleeds, and the uterus must contract to prevent blood loss. After contraction takes place the fundus (top) of the uterus can be palpated as a firm mass at the level of the navel. It is important that the uterus remains firm and the nurse or midwife will make frequent assessments of both the fundus and the amount of bleeding. Uterine massage is commonly used to help the uterus contract.

Following delivery, if the mother had an episiotomy or tearing at the opening of the vagina, it is stitched. In the past, an episiotomy was routine. However, more recent research shows that routine episiotomy, when a normal delivery without complications or instrumentation is anticipated, does not offer benefits in terms of reducing perineal or vaginal trauma. Selective use of episiotomy results in less perineal trauma. A healthcare professional can recommend comfort measures to help to ease perineal pain.

=== Infant caring in the acute phase ===
Within about 10 seconds after birth, the infant takes its first breath and the caregiver places the baby on the mother&#x27;s chest. The infant&#x27;s condition is evaluated using the Apgar scale. The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five criteria which are summarized using words chosen to form an acronym (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration). Until recently, babies were routinely removed from their mothers following birth. However, beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother&#x27;s chest) is of benefit to both mother and infant. As of 2014, early skin-to-skin contact, also called `kangaroo care, is endorsed by all major organizations responsible for the well-being of infants. Thus, to help establish bonding and successful breastfeeding, the caregiver carries out immediate mother and infant assessments as the infant lies on the mother&#x27;s chest. The caregiver removes the infant for further observations only after they have had their first breastfeed, depending on the mother&#x27;s preference. The World Health Organization (WHO) also encourages skin-to-skin contact for the first 24 hours after birth to help regulate the baby&#x27;s temperature.

== Subacute postpartum period ==
The subacute postpartum starts after the acute postpartum period concludes and can last for two to six weeks.

=== Physical recovery in the subacute postpartum period ===

In the first few days following childbirth, the risk of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is relatively high as hypercoagulability increases during pregnancy and is maximal in the postpartum period, particularly for women with C-section with reduced mobility. Anti-coagulants or physical methods such as compression may be used in the hospital, particularly if the woman has risk factors, such as obesity, prolonged immobility, recent C-section, or first-degree relative with a history of thrombotic episode. For women with a history of thrombotic event in pregnancy or prior to pregnancy, anticoagulation is generally recommended. 

The increased vascularity (blood flow) and edema (swelling) of the woman&#x27;s vagina gradually resolves in about three weeks. The cervix gradually narrows and lengths over a few weeks. Postpartum infections can lead to sepsis and if untreated, death. Postpartum urinary incontinence is experienced by about 33% of all women; women who deliver vaginally are about twice as likely to have urinary incontinence as women who give birth via a cesarean. Urinary incontinence in this period increases the risk of long term incontinence. In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.
Kegel exercises are recommended to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and control urinary incontinence. 

Discharge from the uterus, called lochia, will gradually decrease and turn from bright red, to brownish, to yellow and cease at around five or six weeks. Women are advised in this period to wear adult diapers or nappies, disposable maternity briefs, maternity pads or towels, or sanitary napkins. The use of tampons or menstrual cups are contraindicated as they may introduce bacteria and increase the risk of infection. An increase in lochia between 7–14 days postpartum may indicate delayed postpartum hemorrhage.

Hemorrhoids and constipation in this period are common, and stool softeners are routinely given. If an episiotomy or perineal tear had to be sutured, the use of a donut pillow allows the woman to sit pain-free or at least with reduced pain.

Some women feel uterine contractions, called afterpains, during the first few days after delivery. They have been described as similar to menstrual cramps and are more common during breastfeeding, due to the release of oxytocin. The cramping is the compressing of the blood vessels in the uterus to prevent bleeding.

=== Infant caring in the subacute period ===

At two to four days postpartum, a woman&#x27;s breastmilk will generally come in. Historically, women who were not breastfeeding (nursing their babies) were given drugs to suppress lactation, but this is no longer medically indicated. In this period, difficulties with breastfeeding may arise. Maternal sleep is often disturbed as night waking is normal in the newborn phase, and newborns need to be fed every two to three hours, including during the night. The lactation consultant, health visitor, monthly nurse, postnatal doula, or &quot;kraamverzorgster&quot; may be of assistance at this time.

===Psychological disorders===
During the subacute postpartum period, psychological disorders may emerge. Among these are postpartum depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and in rare cases, postpartum psychosis. Postpartum mental illness can affect both mothers and fathers, and is not uncommon. Early detection and adequate treatment is required. Approximately 70–80% of postpartum women will experience the &quot;baby blues&quot; for a few days. Between 10 and 20 percent may experience clinical depression, with a higher risk among those women with a history of postpartum depression, clinical depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders. Prevalence of PTSD following normal childbirth (excluding stillbirth or major complications) is estimated to be between 2.8% and 5.6% at six weeks postpartum.

=== Maternal-infant postpartum evaluation ===
Various organizations across the world recommend routine postpartum evaluation in the postpartum period. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recognizes the postpartum period (the &quot;fourth trimester&quot;) as critical for women and infants. Instead of the traditional single four- to six-week postpartum visit, ACOG, as of 2018, recommends that postpartum care be an ongoing process. They recommend that all women have contact (either in person or by phone) with their obstetric provider within the first three weeks postpartum to address acute issues, with subsequent care as needed. A more comprehensive postpartum visit should be done at four to twelve weeks postpartum. It address the mother&#x27;s mood and emotional well-being, physical recovery after birth, infant feeding, pregnancy spacing and contraception, chronic disease management, and preventive health care and health maintenance. Results of a 2023 systematic review of the evidence suggests a relationship between having sufficient health insurance and attendance at follow-up postpartum care visits that may prevent additional needs for preventable care.

Women with hypertensive disorders should have a blood pressure check within three to ten days postpartum. A 2023 systematic review of the literature suggests monitoring the blood pressure at home of women in the postpartum period appears to help with overall blood pressure measures and supports overall patient satisfaction. More than one half of postpartum strokes occur within ten days of discharge after delivery. Women with chronic medical (e.g., hypertensive disorders, diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid disease) and psychiatric conditions should continue to follow with their obstetric or primary care provider for ongoing disease management. Women with pregnancies complicated by hypertension, gestational diabetes, or preterm birth should undergo counseling and evaluation for cardiometabolic disease, as lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease is higher in these women. 

Similarly, the World Health Organization recommends postpartum evaluation of the mother and infant at three days, one to two weeks, and six weeks postpartum.

== Delayed postpartum period ==
The delayed postpartum period starts after the subacute postpartum period and lasts up to six months. During this time, muscles and connective tissue returns to a pre-pregnancy state. Recovery from childbirth complications in this period, such as urinary and fecal incontinence, painful intercourse, and pelvic prolapse, are typically very slow and in some cases may not resolve. Symptoms of PTSD often subside in this period, dropping from 2.8% and 5.6% at six weeks postpartum to 1.5% at six months postpartum. During this period, infant sleep during the night gradually increases and maternal sleep generally improves.

Approximately three months after giving birth (typically between two and five months), estrogen levels drop and large amounts of hair loss is common, particularly in the temple area (postpartum alopecia). Hair typically grows back normally and treatment is not indicated. 

Many factors figure into the likelihood of post natal problems including the size of the infant; the method of delivery, such as c-section, or of forceps; perineum trauma from either an episiotomy or natural tearing; and the physical condition of the birth mother. Conditions that may result from childbirth include uterine prolapse, cystocele, rectocele, fecal incontinence, and urinary incontinence. Other conditions that may also arise in this period include postpartum thyroiditis. Long-term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.

Ongoing physical and mental health evaluation, risk factor identification, and preventive health care should be provided .

==Return to work==
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends women take at least six weeks off work following childbirth. In the U.S., the only national maternity leave provision is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which entitles new parents to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave. However, 60% of new parents are unable to afford taking unpaid leave for six weeks. According to U.S. Department of Labor statistics, only 17% have access to paid leave. 

The National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, an organization that works to promote the wellbeing of women and families, says &quot;the benefits of paid family leave in states that have introduced it include improved worker morale, time for parents to bond with their children, increased breastfeeding, more children getting vaccinations on time, cuts in children’s hospital admissions and reduced probabilities of having ADHD and hearing problems.&quot;

The United States is the only country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that does not provide paid maternity, paternity, and parental leave. Thirteen countries, including eight of the European countries and Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Argentina and Mexico offer at least three months of equivalent pay.

==Cultures==

Postpartum confinement refers to a system for recovery following childbirth. It begins immediately after the birth, and lasts for a culturally variable length: typically for one month or 30 days, up to 40 days, two months or 100 days. This postnatal recuperation can include &quot;traditional health beliefs, taboos, rituals, and proscriptions.&quot; The practice used to be known as &quot;lying-in&quot;, which, as the term suggests, centres around bed rest. (Maternity hospitals used to use this phrase, as in the General Lying-in Hospital.) Postpartum confinement customs are well-practiced in China, where it is known as &quot;sitting the month&quot;, and similar customs manifest all over the world. A modern version of this rest period has evolved, to give maximum support to the new mother.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; The Flemish Lion) is the official anthem of Flanders, a region and community in Belgium.

== Composition ==
The words of this anthem were written in July 1847 by Hippoliet Van Peene (1811–1864) who was clearly inspired by the song &quot;Sie sollen ihn nicht haben, / den freien Deutschen Rhein, / So lang sich Herzen laben / An seinem Feuerwein&quot; (They must never get our free German Rhine, As long as hearts relish its fiery wine) by the German author Nikolaus Becker.

The music, by Karel Miry (1823–1899), is apparently influenced by Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Sonntags am Rhein.&quot;

Like France&#x27;s Marseillaise, &quot;De Vlaamse Leeuw&quot; is a nationalist battle song. Franco-Belgian political tension in the mid-19th century made the Flemish public mood ripe for such an expression of regional feeling. At the time, it was not meant as anti-Belgian (as it often came to be seen by Flemish separatists and their Belgicist opponents), for the &quot;enemy&quot; it refers to is Belgium&#x27;s southwestern neighbour France, as in the 1302 Battle of the Golden Spurs.

Around 1900, the anthem was in general use among Flemish militants.

On 6 July 1973, a decree by the then (the precursor of the present Flemish Parliament) proclaimed the first two stanzas to be the official national anthem of Flanders. The text and musical notation were officially published on 11 July 1985.

==Lyrics==
Only the first two stanzas and their refrains are performed.

<text>In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American rock band Nirvana, released on September 21, 1993, by DGC Records. After breaking into the mainstream with their previous album, &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991), Nirvana hired Steve Albini to record &quot;In Utero&quot;, seeking a more complex, abrasive sound that was reminiscent of their work prior to &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Although the singer and primary songwriter Kurt Cobain claimed that the album was &quot;very impersonal&quot;, many of its songs contain heavy allusions to his personal life and struggles, expressing feelings of angst that were prevalent on &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

The album was recorded over two weeks in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. After recording finished, rumors circulated that DGC might not release the album due to Albini&#x27;s abrasive and uncommercial sound. The album was mastered by Bob Ludwig to achieve a more desirable sound for both Nirvana and their label. The band later hired the producer Scott Litt to remix the singles &quot;All Apologies&quot;, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;.

&quot;In Utero&quot; was a major critical and commercial success upon release. Critics praised the album&#x27;s raw, unconventional sound and Cobain&#x27;s lyricism. It reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and UK Albums Chart; &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot; reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart. The album has been certified 6× Platinum in the US for 6 million sales and has sold 15 million copies worldwide. It was the final Nirvana album released before Cobain&#x27;s suicide in 1994, six months after the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, planned as a single prior to Cobain&#x27;s death, was released in 2014 and reached number one on the now-defunct &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles Sales chart.

==Background==

Nirvana broke into the mainstream with their second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, in 1991. Despite modest sales estimates, &quot;Nevermind&quot; was a major commercial success, popularizing the grunge movement and alternative rock. Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of the album, citing its production as too polished. Early in 1992, the singer, Kurt Cobain, told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Nirvana&#x27;s next album would showcase &quot;both of the extremes&quot; of their sound, saying: &quot;It&#x27;ll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others. It won&#x27;t be as one-dimensional.&quot; The producer of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, Butch Vig, said later that Cobain had needed to work with a different producer to &quot;reclaim his punk ethics or cred&quot;.

Cobain wanted to start work in mid-1992, but his bandmates lived in different cities, and Cobain and his wife, Courtney Love, were expecting the birth of their daughter, Frances Bean. Nirvana&#x27;s record label, DGC Records, had hoped to release a new Nirvana album for the 1992 holiday season; instead, they released the compilation album &quot;Incesticide&quot;.

In a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview published in July 1992, Cobain said he was interested in recording with Jack Endino, who had produced Nirvana&#x27;s 1989 debut album &quot;Bleach&quot;, and Steve Albini, the former frontman of the noise rock band Big Black, who had produced various independent releases. In Seattle in October 1992, Nirvana recorded several demos with Endino, mainly as instrumentals, including songs later rerecorded for &quot;In Utero&quot;. Endino recalled that they did not ask him to produce their next record, and that they constantly debated working with Albini.

Nirvana recorded another set of demos while on tour in Brazil in January 1993. &quot;Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip&quot; was recorded by Craig Montgomery at BMG Ariola Ltda in Rio de Janeiro, during the three-day demo session. It was originally titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You Down to the Pavement&quot;, a reference to an argument between Cobain and the Guns N&#x27; Roses singer Axl Rose at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards.

Nirvana chose Albini to record their third album. Cobain said he chose Albini because he had produced two of his favorite records, &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; (1988) by the Pixies and &quot;Pod&quot; (1990) by the Breeders. Cobain wanted to use Albini&#x27;s technique of capturing the natural ambience of a room via the placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying.

Albini was known in the American independent music scene for his criticism of the mainstream music industry and had a strict preference for analog recording rather than digital. He sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying rumors of his involvement with Nirvana, only to receive a call from Nirvana&#x27;s management a few days later. Albini dismissed Nirvana as &quot;R.E.M. with a fuzzbox&quot; and &quot;an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound&quot;. However, he accepted the job because he felt sorry for them, perceiving them as &quot;the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with,&quot; at the mercy of their record company.

Before recording began, Nirvana sent Albini a tape of the demos they had made in Brazil. In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the then-unreleased PJ Harvey album &quot;Rid of Me&quot; (1993) to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record. Albini said that Cobain was impressed with the sound of Harvey&#x27;s vocals on the album, &quot;He really liked the way her singing came across. He was a fan.&quot;

==Recording==
Nirvana and Albini set a two-week deadline for recording. At the suggestion of Albini, who was wary of interference from DGC, Nirvana paid for the sessions with their own money. Studio fees totaled $24,000, while Albini took a flat fee of $100,000. Though he stood to earn about $500,000 from royalties, Albini refused to accept them, as he considered taking royalties immoral and &quot;an insult to the artist&quot;.

In February 1993, Nirvana traveled to Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota. Albini did not meet them until the first day of recording, though he had spoken to them beforehand about the type of album they wanted to make; he observed that &quot;they wanted to make precisely the sort of record that I&#x27;m comfortable doing&quot;. The group stayed in a house on the studio grounds. Novoselic compared the isolated conditions to a gulag; he said, &quot;There was snow outside, we couldn&#x27;t go anywhere. We just worked.&quot; For most of the sessions, only the band, Albini, and the technician Bob Weston were present. Nirvana made it clear to DGC and their management company Gold Mountain that they wanted no intrusion, and did not play their work in progress for their A&amp;R representative. Albini instituted a policy of ignoring everyone except for the band members; he said that everyone associated with Nirvana were &quot;the biggest pieces of shit I ever met&quot;.

Nirvana arrived at Pachyderm Studio without their equipment and spent much of the first three days waiting for it to arrive by mail. Once recording began, on February 13, work moved quickly. On most days, the group began work around midday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and worked until midnight. For most songs, Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band. For faster songs, such as &quot;Very Ape&quot; and &quot;Tourette&#x27;s&quot;, the drums were recorded separately in a kitchen for its natural reverb. Albini surrounded Grohl&#x27;s drum kit with about 30 microphones. Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then guitar solos, and finally vocals. The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything they recorded.

Albini saw himself more as an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he let the band choose takes. He said, &quot;Generally speaking, [Cobain] knows what he thinks is acceptable and what isn&#x27;t acceptable [...] He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn&#x27;t think are acceptable.&quot; Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours. Albini said that Cobain, who had struggled with drug addiction, was focused and sober in the studio.

Recording was completed in six days; Cobain had anticipated disagreements with Albini, whom he had heard &quot;was supposedly this sexist jerk&quot;, but called the process &quot;the easiest recording we&#x27;ve ever done, hands down&quot;. The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Love arrived because she missed Cobain. Weston&#x27;s girlfriend, the studio&#x27;s chef, said that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain&#x27;s work and was confrontational with everyone present.

The initial mix of &quot;In Utero&quot; took five days. This was quick by Nirvana&#x27;s standards, but not for Albini, who was used to mixing albums in a day or two. When work on a mix was not producing desired results, the band and Albini took the rest of the day off to watch nature videos, set things on fire and make prank calls. The sessions were completed on February 26. &quot;I Hate Myself and Want to Die&quot; was omitted from the album as Cobain felt it already contained too many &quot;noise&quot; songs.

===Production and mixing dispute===
After the recording sessions ended, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including Gold Mountain and Ed Rosenblatt, the president of DGC&#x27;s parent company, Geffen Records. When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, &quot;The grown-ups don&#x27;t like it.&quot; He said he was told his songwriting was &quot;not up to par&quot;, the sound was &quot;unlistenable&quot;, and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would accept Albini&#x27;s production. Few at Geffen or Gold Mountain had wanted Nirvana to record with Albini, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start again.

Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, &quot;I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there&#x27;s no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can&#x27;t help myself—I&#x27;m just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.&quot; However, a number of Nirvana&#x27;s friends liked the album, and by April, Nirvana was intent on releasing &quot;In Utero&quot; as it was. According to Cobain, &quot;Of course, they want another &quot;Nevermind&quot;, but I&#x27;d rather die than do that. This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.&quot;

The band began to have doubts about the record. Cobain said, &quot;The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong. The whole first week I wasn&#x27;t really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn&#x27;t happen. I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.&quot; The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and asked Albini to remix the album. He declined; as he recalled, &quot;[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, &#x27;Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.&#x27; And I don&#x27;t think he felt he had that yet ... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope.&quot; The band attempted to address their concerns during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel it was perfect.
Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that he doubted Geffen would release the album. Years later, Albini said: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it&#x27;s unreleasable and it&#x27;s all got to be redone.&quot; While Albini&#x27;s remarks in the article drew no reply from Nirvana or Geffen, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana wrote a letter to &quot;Newsweek&quot; denying any pressure to change the album and saying the author had &quot;ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erroneous information&quot;. The band reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in &quot;Billboard&quot;. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything Nirvana submitted, and the label founder, David Geffen, made the unusual move of calling &quot;Newsweek&quot; to complain.

Nirvana considered working with the producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace, who had mixed &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Albini vehemently disagreed, and said the band had agreed not to modify the tracks without his involvement. He initially refused to give the master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. The band eventually had Litt remix songs intended as singles; &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot; were remixed at Seattle&#x27;s Bad Animals Studio in May 1993.

The rest of the album was left unaltered aside from a remastering. Albini was critical of the final mix; he said, &quot;The record in the stores doesn&#x27;t sound all that much like the record that was made, though it&#x27;s still them singing and playing their songs, and the musical quality of it still comes across.&quot; According to Albini, &quot;In Utero&quot; made him unpopular with major record labels, and he faced problems finding work in the year following its release.

==Music and lyrics==

Albini sought to produce a record that sounded nothing like &quot;Nevermind&quot;. He felt the sound of &quot;Nevermind&quot; was &quot;sort of a standard hack recording that has been turned into a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...] That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band.&quot; Instead, he intended to capture a more natural and visceral sound. Albini refused to double-track Cobain&#x27;s vocals and instead recorded him singing in a resonant room. He noted the intensity of Cobain&#x27;s vocals on some tracks; he said, &quot;There&#x27;s a really dry, really loud voice at the end of &#x27;Milk It&#x27; ... that was also done at the end of &#x27;Rape Me&#x27;, where [Cobain] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band.&quot; Albini achieved the sparse drum sound by placing several microphones around Grohl, picking up the natural reverberation of the room. Albini said, &quot;If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that sounds good acoustically and just record it, you&#x27;ve done your job.&quot;

Azerrad asserted in his 1993 biography &quot;Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot; that &quot;In Utero&quot; showcased divergent sensibilities of abrasiveness and accessibility that reflected the upheavals Cobain experienced prior to the album&#x27;s completion. He wrote, &quot;The Beatlesque &#x27;Dumb&#x27; happily coexists beside the all-out frenzied punk graffiti of &#x27;Milk It,&#x27; while &#x27;All Apologies&#x27; is worlds away from the apoplectic &#x27;Scentless Apprentice.&#x27; It&#x27;s as if [Cobain] has given up trying to meld his punk and pop instincts into one harmonious whole. Forget it. This is war.&quot; Cobain believed, however, that &quot;In Utero&quot; was not &quot;any harsher or any more emotional&quot; than any of Nirvana&#x27;s previous records. Novoselic agreed that the album leaned more towards the band&#x27;s &quot;arty, aggressive side&quot;; he said, &quot;There&#x27;s always been [Nirvana] songs like &#x27;About a Girl&#x27; and there&#x27;s always been songs like &#x27;Paper Cuts&#x27;... &quot;Nevermind&quot; came out kind of &#x27;About a Girl&#x27;-y and this [album] came out more &#x27;Paper Cuts&#x27;&quot;. Cobain cited &quot;Milk It&quot; as an example of the more experimental and aggressive direction in which the band&#x27;s music had been moving in the months prior to the sessions at Pachyderm Studio. Novoselic viewed the album&#x27;s singles &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; and &quot;All Apologies&quot; as &quot;gateways&quot; to the more abrasive sound of the rest of the album, telling the journalist Jim DeRogatis that once listeners played the record, they would discover &quot;this aggressive wild sound, a true alternative record&quot;.

Several songs on &quot;In Utero&quot; were written years prior to recording; some dated to 1990. Cobain favored long song titles, such as &quot;Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle&quot;, in reaction to contemporary alternative rock bands that used single-word titles. He continued to work on the lyrics while recording. He told Darcey Steinke in &quot;Spin&quot; in 1993 that, in contrast to &quot;Bleach&quot; and &quot;Nevermind&quot;, the lyrics were &quot;more focused, they&#x27;re almost built on themes&quot;. Azerrad asserted that the lyrics were less impressionistic and more straightforward than in previous Nirvana songs. Azerrad also noted that &quot;virtually every song contains some image of sickness and disease&quot;. In a number of songs, Cobain made reference to books; &quot;Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle&quot; was inspired by &quot;Shadowland&quot;, a 1978 biography of actress Frances Farmer, with whom Cobain had been fascinated ever since he read the book in high school. &quot;Scentless Apprentice&quot; was written about &quot;Perfume: The Story of a Murderer&quot;, a historical horror novel about a perfumer&#x27;s apprentice who attempts to create the ultimate perfume by killing virgin women and taking their scent.

According to the psychologist Thomas Joiner, it is clear that suicide was on Cobain&#x27;s mind as he worked on the album, with its lyrics illustrating &quot;the merging of death with themes of nurturance and life, sometimes in stark and disturbing ways.&quot; Examples include the song &quot;Milk It&quot;, with the phrase &quot;I am my own parasite&quot;, which according to Joiner is a &quot;succinct and even sublime way to combine urges toward death and life.&quot; The words &quot;Her milk is my shit, My shit is her milk&quot; demonstrate that &quot;Cobain clearly had a penchant for disturbing imagery in which themes of nurturance are merged with themes of disease and waste.&quot; Another example is Cobain&#x27;s referral to an &quot;umbilical noose&quot; in the song &quot;Heart Shaped Box&quot;.

Cobain described &quot;In Utero&quot; as &quot;very impersonal&quot;. He also told &quot;Q&quot; that the infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. However, Azerrad argued that much of the album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. Grohl said, &quot;A lot of what he has to say is related to a lot of the shit he&#x27;s gone through. And it&#x27;s not so much teen angst any more. It&#x27;s a whole different ball game: rock star angst.&quot; Cobain downplayed recent events and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media; Azerrad countered that &quot;Rape Me&quot; seemed to deal with that very issue. While Cobain said the song was written long before his addiction problems became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. &quot;Serve the Servants&quot; comments on Cobain&#x27;s life. The opening lines &quot;Teenage angst has paid off well / Now I&#x27;m bored and old&quot; were a reference to Cobain&#x27;s state of mind in the wake of Nirvana&#x27;s success. Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents&#x27; divorce had on his life with the line &quot;That legendary divorce is such a bore&quot; from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines &quot;I tried hard to have a father / But instead I had a dad / I just want you to know that I don&#x27;t hate you any more / There is nothing I could say that I haven&#x27;t thought before&quot;. Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.

According to the journalist Gillian G. Gaar, &quot;Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip&quot; was the kind of improvisational jam Nirvana frequently performed in the studio, but had rarely recorded during earlier sessions, when the priority had been to record as quickly as possible. She wrote that it featured &quot;Cobain alternating between seemingly disconnected singing and spoken-words sections, with Novoselic and Grohl providing a steady background accompaniment, punctuated by bursts of noisy guitar.&quot; Journalist Everett True described the song&#x27;s mood as &quot;playful&quot;, with &quot;the instruments engaging in a game of cat and mouse, almost daring each other to explode in fury&quot;. Novoselic said it was an example of the band &quot;just fucking around&quot;.

==Title and packaging==

Cobain originally wanted to name the album &quot;I Hate Myself and I Want to Die&quot;, a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992. At the time, he used the phrase as a response whenever someone asked him how he was doing. Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was &quot;tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously&quot;. Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit. The band then considered using &quot;Verse Chorus Verse&quot;—a title taken from its song &quot;Verse Chorus Verse&quot;, and a (at the time current) working title of &quot;Sappy&quot;—before eventually settling on &quot;In Utero&quot;. The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.

The art director for &quot;In Utero&quot; was Robert Fisher, who had designed all of Nirvana&#x27;s releases on DGC. Most of the ideas for the artwork for the album and related singles came from Cobain. Fisher recalled that &quot;[Cobain] would just give me some loose odds and ends and say &#x27;Do something with it.&#x27;&quot; The cover of the album is an image of a Transparent Anatomical Manikin, with angel wings superimposed. Cobain created the collage on the back cover which he described as &quot;Sex and woman and &quot;In Utero&quot; and vaginas and birth and death&quot;, consisting of model fetuses, a turtle shell and models of turtles, and body parts lying in a bed of orchids and lilies. The collage had been set up on the floor of Cobain&#x27;s living room and was photographed by Charles Peterson after an unexpected call from Cobain. The album&#x27;s track listing and re-illustrated symbols from Barbara G. Walker&#x27;s &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects&quot; were then positioned around the edge of the collage.

Mannequins of the angel-winged anatomical figure were used as stage props on Nirvana&#x27;s concert tour supporting &quot;In Utero&quot;. One such mannequin later featured at the Experience Music Project museum&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Nirvana: Taking Punk to the Masses&quot;, which ran from April 2011 through 2013 and showcased memorabilia celebrating the band&#x27;s music and history.

==Marketing and sales==
To avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting &quot;In Utero&quot;; their head of marketing told &quot;Billboard&quot; before the album&#x27;s release that they were planning a campaign similar to that of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, and the label would &quot;set things up, duck, and get out of the way&quot;. The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl as part of this strategy. In contrast to &quot;Nevermind&quot;, DGC did not release any of &quot;In Utero&quot;&#x27;s singles commercially in the United States. DGC sent promo copies of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;, to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but did not target Top 40 radio. The band was convinced that &quot;In Utero&quot; would not be as successful as &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, &quot;We&#x27;re certain that we won&#x27;t sell a quarter as much, and we&#x27;re totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much.&quot;

&quot;In Utero&quot; was released on September 13, 1993, on CD, vinyl record and cassette tape in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 on vinyl in the United States, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies. It was issued on CD and in other formats on September 21 in the US. European and Australian versions of &quot;In Utero&quot; released that same month included &quot;Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip&quot; as a hidden bonus track, with a sticker on the cover reading &quot;Exclusive International Bonus Track&quot;, although the booklet referred to the song as a &quot;Devalued American Dollar Purchase Incentive Track&quot;. According to Novoselic, DGC did not want the European version to compete with the US version, and so added the extra track.

&quot;In Utero&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 180,000 copies. The retail chain stores Wal-Mart and Kmart refused to sell it; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Wal-Mart said this was due to lack of consumer demand, while Kmart representatives said the album did not fit with their &quot;merchandise mix&quot;. In truth, both chains feared that customers would be offended by the artwork on the back cover. DGC issued a new version to the stores in March 1994, with edited album artwork, &quot;Rape Me&quot; retitled &quot;Waif Me&quot;, and the Scott Litt remix of &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;. A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the packaging because they wanted their music available to &quot;kids who don&#x27;t have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores&quot;. &quot;In Utero&quot; also debuted at number one in the United Kingdom where according to &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Nirvana confirmed their status as the seminal band of the time&quot;.

In October 1993, Nirvana began their first American tour in two years to promote the album. A second single, a split release that featured &quot;All Apologies&quot; and &quot;Rape Me&quot;, was issued in December in the United Kingdom. The band began a six-week European leg in February 1994, but it was canceled partway through after Cobain suffered a drug overdose in Rome on March 6. Cobain agreed to enter drug rehabilitation, but went missing soon afterward. On April 8, he was found dead in his Seattle home, having shot himself. A third single from &quot;In Utero&quot;, &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;, was canceled in the wake of Cobain&#x27;s death and the subsequent dissolution of Nirvana; limited promotional copies were released in Britain. Three days after Cobain&#x27;s body was discovered, &quot;In Utero&quot; moved from number 72 to number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, with a 122% sales increase of 40,000 copies sold compared to 18,000 in the week before.

&quot;In Utero&quot; was certified five times platinum in the US for shipments of over five million units. It has sold 4,258,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

===Reissues===

For its 20th anniversary, DGC reissued &quot;In Utero&quot; in several formats in September 2013, including the &quot;Live and Loud&quot; show on DVD. For the album&#x27;s 30th anniversary, DGC re-issued &quot;In Utero&quot; in several formats on October 27, 2023, which included the full December 30, 1993 show at the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles and the January 7, 1994 show at the Seattle Centre Arena.

==Critical reception==

Although not as commercially successful as &quot;Nevermind&quot;, &quot;In Utero&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. &quot;Time&quot;″s Christopher John Farley stated in his review, &quot;Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn&#x27;t gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer David Fricke said that the album is &quot;a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it&#x27;s a triumph of the will.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer David Browne commented &quot;Kurt Cobain hates it all&quot;, and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, &quot;The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock &amp; roll, but it is rock &amp; roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock clichés such a release would evoke.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; writer John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, &quot;As a document of a mind in flux – dithering, dissatisfied, unable to come to terms with sanity – Kurt should be proud of [the album]. As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn&#x27;t quite there.&quot; Ben Thompson of &quot;The Independent&quot; commented that in spite of the more abrasive songs, &quot;&quot;In Utero&quot; is beautiful far more often than it is ugly ... Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; felt that the album showcases Cobain&#x27;s songwriting abilities and wrote, &quot;If this is how Cobain is going to develop, the future is lighthouse-bright.&quot;

Several critics ranked &quot;In Utero&quot; one of the best releases of the year; it placed first and second in the album categories of the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop year-end critics&#x27; polls. &quot;The New York Times&quot; included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. It was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards. The guitar riff from &quot;Very Ape&quot; was sampled by British electronic band the Prodigy for their 1994 single &quot;Voodoo People&quot;.

=== Reappraisal ===
&quot;In Utero&quot; has continued to perform commercially and gather critical praise. In a 2003 &quot;Guitar World&quot; article for the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary, Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross argued that &quot;In Utero&quot; was &quot;a far better record than [&quot;Nevermind&quot;] and one that only 10 years later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or underappreciated, then &quot;In Utero&quot; is that lost pearl.&quot; That year, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;In Utero&quot; the 13th best album of the 1990s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 435 on its list The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and 173 in its 2020 updated list. It also ranked it the seventh best album of the 90s.

In 2004, &quot;Blender&quot; named &quot;In Utero&quot; the 94th greatest American album, and in 2005, &quot;Spin&quot; named it the 51st best album of the previous 20 years. In 2005, &quot;In Utero&quot; was ranked number 358 in &quot;Rock Hard&#x27;s&quot; book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2013, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 35 on its list &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In May 2017, &quot;Loudwire&quot; ranked it at number six on its list &quot;The 30 Best Grunge Albums of All Time&quot;. In April 2019, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number eight on its 50 Greatest Grunge Albums list. In October 2023, the Official Charts Company revealed that &quot;In Utero&quot; was the fifth most streamed album from the 1990s in the United Kingdom.

<text> is a Latin phrase meaning &#x27;in place&#x27; or &#x27;on site&#x27;, derived from &#x27; (&#x27;in&#x27;) and&#x27; (ablative of &quot;situs&quot;, ). The term refers to the examination or occurrence of a process within its original context, without relocation. The term is widely used across disciplines to denote methods, observations, or interventions carried out in their natural or intended environment. By contrast, &quot;&quot; methods involve the removal or displacement of materials, specimens, or processes for study, preservation, or modification in a controlled setting, often at the cost of contextual integrity. The earliest known use of &quot;in situ&quot; in the English language dates back to the mid-17th century. In scientific literature, its usage increased from the late 19th century onward, initially in medicine and engineering.

The natural sciences use methods to study phenomena in their original context. In geology, field analysis of soil composition and rock formations provides direct insights into Earth&#x27;s processes. Biological field research observes organisms in their natural habitats, revealing behaviors and ecological interactions that cannot be replicated in a laboratory. In chemistry and experimental physics, techniques allow scientists to observe substances and reactions as they occur, capturing dynamic processes in real time.

 methods have applications in many fields of applied science. In the aerospace industry, &quot;in situ&quot; inspection protocols and monitoring systems assess operational performance without disrupting functionality. Environmental science employs &quot;in situ&quot; ecosystem monitoring to collect accurate data without artificial interference. In medicine, particularly oncology, refers to early-stage cancers that remain confined to their point of origin. This classification, indicating no invasion of surrounding tissues, plays a crucial role in determining treatment plans and prognosis. Space exploration relies on research methods to conduct direct observational studies and data collection on celestial bodies, avoiding the challenges of sample-return missions.

In the humanities, methodologies preserve contextual authenticity. Archaeology maintains the spatial relationships and environmental conditions of artifacts at excavation sites, allowing for more accurate historical interpretation. In art theory and practice, the principle informs both creation and exhibition. Site-specific artworks, such as environmental sculptures or architectural installations, are designed to integrate seamlessly with their surroundings, emphasizing the relationship between artistic expression and its cultural or environmental context.

==History==

The term &quot;in situ&quot; is not found in Classical Latin. Its earliest recorded use is in Late Latin during the 4th century, with the first known instance by Augustine of Hippo. The term became widely used in Medieval Latin. The term&#x27;s earliest known use in the English language dates back to the mid-17th century. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; cites its first appearance in 1648 in the writings of William Molins, author of the anatomical text &quot;Myskotomia&quot;. The usage of &quot;in situ&quot; in scientific literature increased from the late 19th century onward, initially in medicine and engineering, including geological surveys and petroleum extraction. During this period, the term described analyses conducted within the living human body or inside oil wells, among other applications. The compound term &quot;carcinoma in situ&quot;, denoting abnormal cells that remain confined to their site of origin without invading surrounding tissue, was first used in 1932 by U.S. surgical pathologist Albert C. Broders. 

The concept of &quot;in situ&quot; in contemporary art emerged as a framework in the late 1960s and 1970s, referring to artworks created specifically for a particular space. By the mid-1980s, &quot;in situ&quot; was adopted in materials science, particularly in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where a catalyst in one phase facilitates a chemical reaction in a different phase. Its usage later expanded beyond catalysis and is now applied across various disciplines within materials science. , the term &quot;in situ&quot; had been used in more than 910,000 scientific publications since 1874, while &quot;ex situ&quot; had appeared in over 29,000 scientific publications since 1958. &quot;In situ&quot; remains one of the most widely used and versatile Latin terms in contemporary medical discourse.

==Applications==
===Natural sciences===
====Astronomy====
In astronomy, &quot;in situ&quot; measurement involves collecting data directly at or near a celestial object using spacecraft or instruments physically present at the location. For example, the Parker Solar Probe conducts &quot;in situ&quot; studies of Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, while the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission similarly analyzed Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere. &quot;In situ&quot; formation refers to astronomical objects that formed at their current locations without significant migration. Some theories propose that planets, such as Earth, formed in their present orbits rather than moving from elsewhere. Star clusters may form within their host galaxy, rather than being accreted from external sources.

====Biology====


In cell biology, &quot;in situ&quot; techniques allow the examination of cells or tissues within their native environment, preserving their natural structure and context. These approaches contrast with techniques requiring the extraction or isolation of cellular components. One example is &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization (ISH), a technique designed to identify and localize specific nucleic acid sequences within intact cells or tissue sections. ISH employs labeled probes, which are strands of nucleic acids engineered to bind selectively to target sequences. These probes are tagged with detectable markers, such as fluorophores or radioactive isotopes, enabling visualization of the precise spatial distribution of the targeted DNA or RNA. By maintaining the structural integrity of the sample, the technique facilitates mapping of genetic material within its original cellular or tissue framework.

In biological field research, the term &quot;in situ&quot; refers to the study of living organisms within their natural habitat. This includes collecting biological samples, conducting experiments, measuring abiotic factors, and documenting ecological or behavioral observations without relocating the subject.

====Chemistry====
In organic chemistry, &quot;in situ&quot; refers to processes that take place within the reaction mixture without isolating intermediates. This approach is useful for handling unstable compounds that decompose rapidly, and enhances laboratory safety by eliminating the need to isolate potentially hazardous intermediates. In one-pot synthetic sequences, &quot;in situ&quot; work-up modifications enable multiple reaction steps to proceed within a single vessel, reducing exposure to unstable or hazardous substances, such as azide intermediates, which may pose safety risks if isolated. Another example is the Corey–Chaykovsky reagent, a sulfur ylide, is generated &quot;in situ&quot; by deprotonating sulfonium halides with a strong base. This approach is used because unstablized sulfur ylides are highly reactive. If isolated, the ylide could decompose or lose reactivity, making its direct generation and use in the reaction mixture more practical. 

Analytical techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry facilitate real-time monitoring of &quot;in situ&quot; reactions. These methods enable researchers to detect short-lived substances that form during a reaction, such as intermediates that might not be stable enough to isolate, and adjust conditions to improve the process—all without disturbing the reaction itself.

In electrochemistry, &quot;in situ&quot; experiments are performed under the normal operating conditions of an electrochemical cell, with the electrode maintained at a controlled potential (typically by a potentiostat). By contrast, &quot;ex situ&quot; experiments occur outside those operating conditions, usually without potential control—for example, after the electrode has been removed from the cell or left at open-circuit. Maintaining potential control in &quot;in situ&quot; measurements preserves the electrochemical environment at the electrode–electrolyte interface, ensuring that the double layer and ongoing electron-transfer reactions remain intact at a given electrode potential.

In aerospace structural health monitoring, &quot;in situ&quot; inspection involves diagnostic techniques that assess components within their operational environments, avoiding the need for disassembly or service interruptions. The nondestructive testing (NDT) methods commonly used for &quot;in situ&quot; damage detection include infrared thermography, which measures thermal emissions to identify structural anomalies but is less effective on low-emissivity materials; speckle shearing interferometry (shearography), which analyzes surface deformation patterns but requires carefully controlled environmental conditions; and ultrasonic testing, which uses sound waves to detect internal defects in composite materials but can be time-intensive for large structures. Despite these individual limitations, the integration of these complementary techniques enhances overall diagnostic accuracy. 

Another approach involves real-time monitoring using alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) sensor arrays. These systems detect structural degradation, including matrix discontinuities, interlaminar delaminations, and fiber fractures, by analyzing variations in electrical resistance and capacitance within composite laminate structures.

====Biological and biomedical engineering====

In biological engineering, &quot;in situ&quot; describes experimental treatments applied to cells or tissues while they remain intact, rather than using extracts. It also refers to assays or manipulations performed on whole tissues without disrupting their natural structure.

In biomedical engineering, &quot;in situ&quot; polymerization is used to produce protein nanogels, which serve as a versatile platform for the storage and release of therapeutic proteins. This approach has applications in cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnostics, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.

====Civil engineering====

In construction engineering, &quot;in situ&quot; construction refers to building work carried out directly on-site using raw materials, as opposed to prefabrication, where components are manufactured off-site and assembled on-site. &quot;In situ&quot; concrete is poured at its final location, offering structural stability compared to precast construction. In wall construction, reinforcing bars are assembled first, followed by the installation of formwork to contain the poured concrete. Once the concrete has cured, the formwork is removed, leaving the wall in place. Prefabrication, by contrast, enhances efficiency by reducing on-site labor and accelerating project timelines, though it requires precise pre-planning and incurs higher manufacturing and transportation costs.

In geotechnical engineering, the term &quot;in situ&quot; describes soil in its natural, undisturbed state, as opposed to fill material, which has been excavated and relocated. The differences between undisturbed soil and fill material affect how well a site can support structures, install underground utilities, and manage water drainage. Proper assessment of soil conditions is necessary to prevent issues such as uneven settling, unstable foundations, and poor water infiltration.

====Computer science====

In computer science, &quot;in situ&quot; refers to the use of technology and user interfaces to provide continuous access to situationally relevant information across different locations and contexts. Examples include athletes viewing biometric data on smartwatches to improve their performance or a presenter looking at tips on a smart glass to reduce their speaking rate during a speech.

An algorithm is said to be an &quot;in situ&quot; algorithm, or in-place algorithm, if the extra amount of memory required to execute the algorithm is O(1), that is, does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input. Typically such an algorithm operates on data objects directly in place rather than making copies of them.

For example, heapsort is an &quot;in situ&quot; sorting algorithm, which sorts the elements of an array in place. Quicksort is an &quot;in situ&quot; sorting algorithm, but in the worst case it requires linear space on the call stack (this can be reduced to log space). Merge sort is generally not written as an &quot;in situ&quot; algorithm.

AJAX partial page updates are an example of &quot;in situ&quot; processing in a web UI/UX context. Web 2.0 introduced AJAX and asynchronous requests, allowing portions of a web page to be updated with new data without requiring a full page reload, unlike the traditional HTML model. More broadly, asynchronous data transfers and background tasks can be considered &quot;in situ&quot;, as they operate without disrupting the primary user interface and typically notify completion through a callback mechanism.

With big data, in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located, rather than the other way like in traditional RDBMS systems where data is moved to computational space. This is also known as in-situ processing.

====Earth sciences====

In Earth sciences, particularly in geomorphology, &quot;in situ&quot; refers to natural materials or processes occurring at their point of origin without being transported. An example is weathering, in which rocks undergo physical or chemical disintegration in place, in contrast to erosion, which involves the removal and relocation of materials by agents such as wind, water, or ice. Soil formed from the weathering of underlying bedrock is an example of an &quot;in situ&quot; formation. &quot;In situ&quot; measurements, such as those of soil moisture, rock stress, groundwater trends, or radiation levels, are conducted on-site to provide direct data. These measurements are often essential for validating remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery, which is widely used for large-scale environmental monitoring but may require &quot;in situ&quot; confirmation to ensure accuracy. 
In oceanography, &quot;in situ&quot; observational methods involve direct measurements of oceanic conditions, typically conducted during shipboard surveys. These methods employ specialized instruments, such as the Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) device, which records parameters such as salinity, temperature, pressure, and biogeochemical properties like oxygen saturation. Historically, oceanographers used reversing thermometers, which were inverted at specific depths to trap mercury and preserve temperature readings for subsequent analysis. These instruments have been largely replaced by CTD devices and expendable bathythermographs.
In atmospheric sciences, &quot;in situ&quot; measurements refer to observations of atmospheric properties obtained using instruments placed within the environment being studied. Aircraft, balloons, and rockets are used to carry some of these instruments, allowing for direct interaction with the air to collect data. For example, radiosondes, carried aloft by weather balloons, measure atmospheric parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure as they ascend through the atmosphere, while anemometers, typically positioned at ground level or on towers, record wind speed and direction at specific locations. In contrast, remote sensing techniques, such as weather radar and satellite observations, collect atmospheric data from a distance by using electromagnetic radiation to infer properties without direct contact with the atmosphere.

====Materials science====

By the mid-1980s, the term &quot;in situ&quot; was adopted in materials science, particularly in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, where a catalyst in one phase facilitates a chemical reaction in a different phase. The term later expanded beyond catalysis and is now applied across various disciplines of materials science, alongside the opposite designation &quot;ex situ&quot;. For example, &quot;in situ&quot; describes the study of a sample maintained in a steady state
condition within a controlled environment, where specific parameters such as temperature or pressure are regulated. This approach allows researchers to observe materials under conditions that replicate their functional states. Examples include a sample held at a fixed temperature inside a cryostat, an electrode material operating within an electric battery, or a specimen enclosed within a sealed container to protect it from external influences.

In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), &quot;in situ&quot; refers to the observation of materials as they are exposed to external stimuli within the microscope, under conditions that mimic their natural environments. This enables real-time observation of material behavior at the nanoscale. External stimuli in &quot;in situ&quot; TEM/STEM experiments include mechanical loading and pressure, temperature changes, electrical currents (biasing), radiation, and environmental factors—such as exposure to gas, liquid, and magnetic field—or any combination of these. These conditions allow researchers to study atomic-level processes such as phase transformations, chemical reactions, or mechanical deformations, providing insights into material behavior and properties essential for advancements in materials science.

====Medicine====

In medical terminology, &quot;in situ&quot; belongs to a group of two-word Latin expressions, including &quot;in vitro&quot; (&#x27;within the glass&#x27;, e.g., laboratory experiments), &quot;in vivo&quot; (&#x27;within the living&#x27;, e.g., experiments on living organisms), and &quot;ex vivo&quot; (&#x27;out of the living&#x27;, e.g., experiments on extracted tissues), which facilitate communication of experimental or clinical contexts. Like abbreviations, these terms convey essential information concisely. &quot;In situ&quot; is a widely employed term in the medical field, used to describe phenomena or processes as they occur in their original location. It is applied in diverse contexts such as oncology, measurement acquisition, medical simulation, and anatomical examination. Because of its versatility across these varied applications, &quot;in situ&quot; is considered one of the most productive Latin expressions in contemporary medical discourse.

In oncology, &quot;in situ&quot; is commonly applied in the context of carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; (CIS), a term describing abnormal cells confined to their original location without invasion of surrounding tissue. The earliest known use of the term dates back to 1932 in the writing of U.S. surgical pathologist Albert C. Broders. CIS is a critical term in early cancer diagnosis, as it signifies a non-invasive stage, allowing for more targeted interventions such as localized excision or monitoring—before potential progression to invasive cancer. Similarly, melanoma &quot;in situ&quot; is an early, localized form of melanoma, a type of malignant skin cancer. In this stage, the cancerous melanocytes—the pigment-producing cells that give skin its color—are confined to the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. The melanoma has not yet penetrated into the deeper dermal layers or metastasized to other parts of the body.

Beyond oncology, &quot;in situ&quot; is used in fields where maintaining natural anatomical or physiological positions is essential. In orthopedic surgery, the term refers to procedures that preserve the natural alignment or position of bones or joints. For example, orthopedic plates or screws may be placed without altering the bone&#x27;s original structure, as in &quot;[the patient] was treated operatively with an &quot;in situ&quot; cannulated hip screw fixation&quot;. In cardiothoracic surgery, &quot;in situ&quot; often describes techniques where blood vessels are utilized in their original anatomical position for surgical purposes. For example, the internal thoracic artery can be left attached to the subclavian artery while rerouting blood flow to bypass occluded coronary arteries and improve heart circulation. In organ transplantation, &quot;in situ&quot; is used to describe procedures performed within the donor&#x27;s body to preserve organ viability. &quot;In situ&quot; perfusion is a technique employed during organ retrieval to restore blood flow to organs while they remain in their original location. This method minimizes ischemic injury and preserves organ viability for transplantation. In contrast, &quot;ex situ&quot; machine perfusion involves perfusing the organ outside the donor&#x27;s body, typically after it has been removed.

====Space exploration====
Future space exploration or terraforming may rely on obtaining supplies &quot;in situ&quot;, such as previous plans to power the Orion space vehicle with fuel minable on the Moon. The Mars Direct mission concept is based primarily on the &quot;in situ&quot; fuel production using the Sabatier reaction, which produces methane and water from a reaction of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

In the space sciences, &quot;in situ&quot; refers to measurements of the particle and field environment that the satellite is embedded in, such as the detection of energetic particles in the solar wind, or magnetic field measurements from a magnetometer.

====Urban planning====
In urban planning, &quot;in situ&quot; upgrading is an approach to and method of upgrading informal settlements.

===Humanities===
====Archaeology====
In archaeology, the term &quot;in situ&quot; refers to artifacts and other materials that remain in their original depositional context, undisturbed since their initial placement. Recording the exact spatial coordinates, stratigraphic position, and surrounding matrix of &quot;in situ&quot; materials is crucial for reconstructing past human activities and historical processes. While artifacts are often removed for analysis, certain archaeological features—such as hearths, postholes, and architectural foundations—must be thoroughly documented in place to preserve their contextual information during excavation. This documentation relies on various methods, including detailed field notes, scaled technical drawings, cartographic representation, and high-resolution photographic documentation. Current archaeological practice incorporates advanced digital technologies, including 3D laser scanning, photogrammetry, unmanned aerial vehicles, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to capture complex spatial relationships. Artifacts found outside their original context (&quot;ex situ&quot;), often due to natural disturbances or unrecorded excavations, have less interpretive value. However, these displaced materials can still provide clues about the spatial distribution and typological characteristics of unexcavated &quot;in situ&quot; deposits, guiding future excavation efforts.

The Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage sets mandatory guidelines for signatory states regarding the treatment of underwater shipwrecks. One of its key principles is that &quot;in situ&quot; preservation is the preferred approach. This policy is based on the unique conditions of underwater environments, where low oxygen levels and stable temperatures help preserve artifacts over long periods. Removing artifacts from these conditions and exposing them to the atmosphere often accelerates deterioration, particularly the oxidation of iron-based materials.

In mortuary archaeology, &quot;in situ&quot; documentation involves systematically recording and cataloging human remains in their original depositional positions. These remains are often embedded in complex matrices of sediment, clothing, and associated artifacts. Excavating mass graves presents additional challenges, as they may contain hundreds of individuals. Before identifying individuals or determining causes of death, archaeologists must carefully document spatial relationships and contextual details to preserve forensic and historical information.

====Art====

The concept of &quot;in situ&quot; in contemporary art emerged as a framework in the late 1960s and 1970s, referring to artworks created specifically for a particular space. These works integrate the site&#x27;s physical, historical, political, and sociological characteristics as essential elements of their composition. This approach contrasts with autonomous artistic production, where artworks are independent of their eventual display locations. Theoretical discussions, particularly in the writings and practice of French conceptual artist and sculptor Daniel Buren, have emphasized the dynamic relationship between artistic intervention and its surrounding environment.

The site-specific installations of Christo and Jeanne-Claude exemplify the application of &quot;in situ&quot; principles in art. Their large-scale interventions such as &quot;The Pont Neuf Wrapped&quot; (1985) and &quot;Wrapped Reichstag&quot; (1995) involved the systematic wrapping of buildings and landscape elements in fabric, temporarily transforming familiar spaces and altering public perception. The concept of &quot;in situ&quot; art further evolved with the land art movement, wherein artists such as Robert Smithson and Michael Heizer integrated their works directly into natural landscapes and created an inseparable connection between the artwork and its environment. In contemporary aesthetic discourse, &quot;in situ&quot; has expanded into a broader theoretical construct, describing artistic practices that reinforce the fundamental unity between a work and its site.

====Law====
In legal contexts, &quot;in situ&quot; is often used for its literal meaning. For example, in Hong Kong, in-situ land exchange refers to a mechanism where landowners can swap their existing or expired leases with new grants for the same land parcel. This approach facilitates redevelopment while preserving the property&#x27;s original location.

In the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term &quot;in situ&quot; is used to distinguish between an exiled government and a government with effective control over the territory, i.e. the government &quot;in situ&quot;.

====Linguistics====

In linguistics, particularly in syntax, an element is said to be &quot;in situ&quot; if it is pronounced in the same position where it is interpreted. For example, in languages such as Chinese, wh-elements remain &quot;in situ&quot;, as in a structure comparable to &quot;John bought what?&quot;, where &quot;what&quot; occupies the same position as the grammatical object in the affirmative counterpart (&quot;John bought bread&quot;). In contrast, English typically employs wh-movement, as seen in &quot;What did John buy?&quot;, where the wh-element is displaced from its original position.

===Social sciences===
====Economics====
In economics, &quot;in situ&quot; is used when referring to the &quot;in place&quot; storage of a product, usually a natural resource. More generally, it refers to any situation where there is no out-of-pocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold. Examples of &quot;in situ&quot; storage would be oil and gas wells, all types of mineral and gem mines, stone quarries, timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested, and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay.

====Psychology====
In experimental psychology, &quot;in situ&quot; typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting.

===Miscellaneous===
====Gastronomy====
In gastronomy, &quot;in situ&quot; refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available at the site of the event. Here a person is not going to the restaurant, but the restaurant comes to the person&#x27;s home.

====Mining====
&quot;In situ&quot; leaching or &quot;in situ&quot; recovery refers to the mining technique of injecting lixiviant underground to dissolve ore and bringing the pregnant leach solution to surface for extraction. Commonly used in uranium mining but has also been used for copper mining.

====Petroleum industry====
In petroleum industry, &quot;in situ&quot; techniques involve the application of heat or solvents to extract heavy crude oil or bitumen from reservoirs located beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface. Several &quot;in situ&quot; methods exist, but those that utilize heat, particularly steam, have proven to be the most effective for oil sands extraction. The most widely used &quot;in situ&quot; technique is steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). This method employs two horizontal wells: the upper well injects steam to heat the bitumen, reducing its viscosity, while the lower well collects the mobilized oil for extraction. SAGD has gained prominence in the Canadian province of Alberta, due to its efficiency in recovering bitumen from deep reservoirs. Approximately 80% of Alberta&#x27;s oil sands deposits are located at depths that render open-pit mining impractical, making &quot;in situ&quot; techniques such as SAGD the primary method of extraction.

<text>Moel Famau is the highest hill in the Clwydian Range and the highest point (county top) of the county of Flintshire in Wales (both the historic county and the current council area). It lies on the boundary between Denbighshire and Flintshire. The hill, which also gives its name to the Moel Famau country park, has been classed as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty since 1985. It is also surrounded by several well-preserved Iron Age hill forts. It is also the fourth-highest peak in the extended AONB of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley.

A northern part of the Offa&#x27;s Dyke long-distance footpath, one of the UK&#x27;s most popular National Trails, crosses the summit of Moel Famau and the Jubilee Tower. Loggerheads Country Park is nearby.

==Name==
Although historical sources attest to a variety of spellings (such as &quot;Moel Famma&quot;, &quot;Moel Vamma&quot; and &quot;Moel Fammau&quot;), the only two in common use today are &quot;Moel Famau&quot; and &quot;Moel Fama&quot;. The first word &quot;moel&quot; is a common Welsh place-name element meaning &quot;bare&quot;. The meaning and preferred spelling of the second element are less certain, but is roughly translated into &quot;mothers&quot;.

Attestations from as early as the fourteenth century consistently show that the second element ends in &quot;–a&quot;. This conforms to the local pronunciation () and is &quot;the preferred spelling&quot;, according to the &quot;Dictionary of the Place-names of Wales&quot;. The meaning of the &quot;Fama&quot; is somewhat uncertain, but it is probably a lenited form of a personal name, &#x27;Mama&#x27;.

The alternative form &quot;Moel Famau&quot; is a result of an &quot;antiquarian perception&quot; first attested in the eighteenth century that the second element was the lenited form of the common noun &quot;mamau&quot; (&quot;mothers&quot;). If that were the case, however, the early forms in &quot;–a&quot; would be very difficult to explain. Nevertheless, the form &quot;Moel Famau&quot; is common today and it is still sometimes said to mean &quot;mothers&#x27; hill&quot;.

==Country Park==
The park, which covers an area over 3 square miles (8 km2), is managed by Denbighshire Countryside Service which is responsible for the heather moorland, dry stone walls and access paths, and provides information and facilities for visitors. The area is home to wildlife such as red grouse, European stonechat and Eurasian curlew. The summit of Moel Famau lies just within the Flintshire border.

Natural Resources Wales manage the neighbouring forest as a sustainable conifer plantation for timber production and tourism.

==Walking==

Numerous well-maintained paths of varying difficulty lead to the summit. Two of the easiest and most popular routes start from the southern car parks at Bwlch Penbarras, a pass between Moel Famau and Foel Fenlli, about from the summit. The northern route begins at the car park south of the Iron Age hill fort at Moel Arthur. A footpath to the top of Moel Famau also begins from the village of Cilcain.

Much of North East Wales and North West England can sometimes be seen from the summit of Moel Famau. This includes parts of Denbighshire, Flintshire, Cheshire and Merseyside. On clear days, Snowdonia can be seen to the west, the Irish Sea to the north, and to the east Liverpool, Chester, Winter Hill, and Blackpool Tower.

==Jubilee Tower==
The tower, which was built to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of George III in 1810, was designed by Thomas Harrison of Chester and is a Grade II listed building. It was designed like an Egyptian obelisk with three tiers. Although the foundation stone was laid in 1810 by George Kenyon, 2nd Baron Kenyon, lack of funds meant that the tower was never completed. On three sides it was to have had the following inscription: Georgia III Brittaniarum Regi, Pio Justo Patri Patrio Commitatus, Denbigh et Flint, Jubilantus Posuere, 25 Octobris, Anno Domino 1809. 
In 1862, a major storm brought down the incomplete tower. The remaining upper part of the structure was demolished for safety reasons leaving just the base. Most of the rubble was removed from the site; smaller stonework was reused by local farmers for dry stone walls.

In October 2010, a celebration was observed by local communities, in both Flintshire and Denbighshire, to mark the 200th anniversary of the laying of the Jubilee Tower&#x27;s foundation stone. An artistic light and laser installation by a local artist was commissioned by the local authorities to illuminate the tower.

<doc id="379983" wikidata="Q6451172" url="?curid=379983" title="Morgue">
<text>A morgue or mortuary (in a hospital or elsewhere) is a place used for the storage of human corpses awaiting identification (ID), removal for autopsy, respectful burial, cremation or other methods of disposal. In modern times, corpses have customarily been refrigerated to delay decomposition.

==Etymology and lexicology==

The term &quot;mortuary&quot; dates from the early 14th century, from Anglo-French &quot;mortuarie&quot;, meaning &quot;gift to a parish priest from a deceased parishioner,&quot; from Medieval Latin mortuarium, noun use of neuter of Late Latin adjective mortuarius &quot;pertaining to the dead,&quot; from Latin &quot;mortuus&quot;, pp. of &quot;mori&quot; &quot;to die&quot; (see mortal (adj.)). The meaning of &quot;place where the deceased are kept temporarily&quot; was first recorded in 1865, as a euphemism for the earlier English term &quot;deadhouse&quot;.

The term &quot;morgue&quot; comes from the French. First used to describe the inner wicket of a prison, where new prisoners were kept so that jailers and turnkeys could recognize them in the future, it took on its modern meaning in fifteenth-century Paris, being used to describe part of the Châtelet used for the storage and identification of unknown corpses.

&quot;Morgue&quot; is predominantly used in North American English, while &quot;Mortuary&quot; is used in the U.K., although both terms are used interchangeably. The euphemisms “Rose Cottage” and “Rainbow’s End” are sometimes used in British hospitals to enable discussion in front of patients and visitors, the latter mainly for children.

An auxiliary person responsible for the care of the deceased is known as a mortuary assistant or diener. A person qualified in the evisceration and reconstruction of the deceased is called an Anatomical Pathology Technician in the UK, also called a mortician or autopsy technician in the USA.

==Types==
There are two types of mortuary cold chambers:

;Positive temperature
Bodies are kept between 2 °C (36 °F) and 4 °C (39 °F). While this is usually used for keeping bodies for up to several weeks, it does not prevent decomposition, which continues at a slower rate than at room temperature.

;Negative temperature
Bodies are kept at between −10 °C (14 °F) and −50 °C (−58 °F). Usually used at forensic institutes, particularly when a body has not been identified. At these temperatures the body is completely frozen, and decomposition is significantly reduced, but not prevented.

==Around the globe==

In some countries, the body of the deceased is embalmed before disposal, which makes refrigeration unnecessary.

In many countries, the family of the deceased must make the burial within 72 hours (three days) of death, but in some other countries it is usual that burial takes place some weeks or months after the death. This is why some corpses are kept as long as one or two years at a hospital or in a funeral home. When the family has enough money to organize the ceremony, the corpse is taken from the cold chamber for burial.

In some funeral homes, the morgue is in the same room, or directly adjacent to, the specially designed ovens, known as retorts, that are used in funerary cremation. Some religions dictate that, should a body be cremated, the family must witness its incineration. To honor these religious rites, many funeral homes install a viewing window, which allows the family to watch as the body is inserted into the retort. In this way, the family can honor their customs without entering the morgue.

Oversized mortuary fridge spaces have been installed in British hospitals to cope with the increase in obesity.

In the UK the NHS has asked health trusts to review mortuary access security and procedures in the wake of the David Fuller case in November 2021.

===Waiting mortuary=== 
A waiting mortuary is a mortuary building designed specifically for the purpose of confirming that deceased persons are truly deceased. Prior to the advent of modern methods of verifying death, people feared that they would be buried alive. To alleviate such fears, the recently deceased were housed for a time in waiting mortuaries, where attendants would watch for signs of life. The corpses would be allowed to decompose partially prior to burial. Waiting mortuaries were most popular in 19th-century Germany, and were often large, ornate halls.

A bell was strung to the corpses to alert attendants of any motion. Although there is no documented case of a person being saved from accidental burial in this way,
it is sometimes erroneously believed that this was the origin of the phrase &quot;saved by the bell&quot;, whilst in fact, the phrase originates from the sport of boxing.

===Temporary morgues===

In practice, local jurisdictions only support sufficient permanent morgue capacity to handle the usual number of fatalities from all causes expected to occur there over time. Prior to modern times and even sometimes today especially in poorer jurisdictions, in case of any incident causing many deaths in such a short period of time so as to overwhelm a locale&#x27;s regular mortuary services the bodies would usually be disposed of as quickly as possible, and (often not withstanding the locale&#x27;s usual customs) will be disposed of by whatever method is most convenient considering the supplies and equipment on hand.

In contrast, modern affluent jurisdictions will usually make every effort to requisition equipment and/or facilities not normally used to store corpses to act as temporary morgues whenever necessary. In theory, any refrigerated space spacious enough to fit a person can act as a temporary morgue in such a situation. In practice, government emergency preparedness procedures usually designate suitable public facilities such as ice rinks to act as morgues if available. Alternatively, refrigerator trucks are sometimes used as morgues, the advantage being that they are usually readily available and can easily be transported to where they are needed, thus sparing the burden of otherwise having to quickly transport large numbers of corpses over great distances.

While temporary morgues are usually set up for isolated local incidents, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous temporary morgues being set up across the planet.

<doc id="379985" wikidata="Q738564" url="?curid=379985" title="Dall's porpoise">
<text>Dall&#x27;s porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli) is a species of porpoise endemic to the North Pacific. It is the largest of porpoises and the only member of the genus Phocoenoides. The species is named after American naturalist W. H. Dall.
==Taxonomy==
Dall&#x27;s porpoise is the only member of the genus &quot;Phocoenoides&quot;. The &quot;dalli&quot; and &quot;truei&quot; types were initially described as separate species in 1911, but later studies determined that the available evidence only supported the existence of one species. Currently, these two color morphs are recognized as distinct subspecies, Dall&#x27;s porpoise (&quot;Phocoenoides dalli dalli&quot;) and True&#x27;s porpoise (&quot;Phocoenoides dalli truei&quot;).

==Description==

Dall&#x27;s porpoises can be easily distinguished from other porpoises and cetacean species within their range. They have a wide, robust body, a comparatively tiny head, and no distinguished beak. Their flippers are positioned at the front of the body and a triangular dorsal fin sits mid-body. Patterns of coloration are highly variable, but Dall&#x27;s porpoises are mostly black, have white to grey patches on the flank and belly, and frosting on the dorsal fin and trailing edge of the fluke.

They are the largest porpoise species, growing up to in length and weighing . Sexual dimorphism is apparent in body size and shape, with mature males being larger, developing a deeper caudal peduncle, and having a dorsal fin that is significantly angled forward in comparison to a female&#x27;s. Dall&#x27;s porpoise calves have a greyish coloration with no frosting on flippers and flukes. Calves measure about 100 cm at birth. Growth rates are similar at first, but at about two years old males begin to grow faster than females. Externally, maturity is measured by length which is usually attained at 3–5 years. Sizes vary between populations, but on average females reach a maximum size of 210 cm and males grow to about 220 cm, except in the southern Okhotsk Sea where males can grow as long as 239 cm.

Two colormorphs have been identified: the &quot;dalli&quot; type and &quot;truei&quot; type. The &quot;truei&quot; type, found only in the western Pacific, has a white belly patch that extends farther forward across the body than that of the &quot;dalli&quot; type.

==Distribution and habitat==

Dall&#x27;s porpoises are limited to the North Pacific: in the east from California to the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea, and in the west down to the Sea of Japan. They have been sighted as far south as Scammon&#x27;s Lagoon in Baja California when water temperature was unseasonably cold.

Dall&#x27;s porpoises generally prefer cold waters less than . Although mostly an offshore species, they do occur in deeper coastal waters, near submarine canyons or in fjords.

==Behavior==
===Foraging===
Dall&#x27;s porpoises are opportunistic, hunting a variety of surface and mid-water species. Common prey are mesopelagic fish, such as myctophids, and gonatid squid. Stomach content analyses have also found cases of crustacean consumption, including krill and shrimp, but this is abnormal and likely not an important part of their diet. A previous study revealed that tagged Dall&#x27;s porpoises spent most of their time within 10 m of the surface, but have been recorded diving to depths of up to 94 m.

===Social===
Dall&#x27;s porpoises live in small, fluid groups of two to ten individuals, but aggregations of hundreds have been reported. They have a polygynous mating system in which males compete for females. During the mating season, a male will select a fertile female and guard her to ensure paternity. While guarding, males may sacrifice opportunities to forage on deep dives. Births usually take place in the summer after a gestation period of 11 to 12 months. Females generally give birth every 3 years, depending on their condition. Life expectancy is about 15 to 20 years, but a lot about their mortality is unknown.

Dall&#x27;s porpoises are prey to transient killer whales. They have, however, been observed in association with resident killer whales, engaging in apparent play behaviors with their calves, and swimming with them. One recognizable Dall&#x27;s porpoise was observed travelling with the AB pod of resident orca from May through October 1984. Great white sharks are also a known predator, with at least one documented case on the eastern North Pacific Ocean.

===Movement===

Dall&#x27;s porpoises are highly active swimmers. Rapid swimming at the surface creates a characteristic spray called a &quot;rooster tail&quot;. They are commonly seen approaching boats to bowride, and they will also ride on the waves formed at the heads of larger swimming whales.

==Population status==
Abundance throughout their range and is estimated to be over one million, but current population trends are unknown.

Surveys along the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington between 2008 and 2014 estimated a population abundance of 25,800. Alaska&#x27;s population is estimated to be 83,400. Abundance in coastal British Columbia is nearly 5,000 individuals.

Populations in the western North Pacific are divided by both subspecies and migratory patterns. Abundance of the offshore &quot;dalli&quot; type is about 162,000. It is estimated that there are about 173,000 &quot;dalli&quot; type that travel between Japan and the southern Okhotsk Sea. The &quot;dalli&quot; type that migrates to the Okhotsk Sea in the summer is estimated at 111,000. The population of &quot;truei&quot;-type porpoises migrating between Japan and the central Okhotsk Sea number about 178,000.

==Threats==
===Fisheries bycatch===
Dall&#x27;s porpoises are vulnerable to fisheries bycatch. Thousands were killed in commercial driftnet fisheries until the United Nations issued a moratorium in the 1990s. Before the moratorium went into effect, 8,000 Dall&#x27;s porpoises are estimated to have been bycaught in one year alone (1989–1990). Smaller numbers, from several hundred to a few thousand, are estimated to have been bycaught in Japanese salmon fisheries in US waters and in the Bering Sea from 1981 to 1987. Driftnet and trawl fisheries still operate in some areas throughout their range, with particularly high levels of bycatch in Russian waters.

===Hunting===

The Dall&#x27;s porpoise is still harvested for meat in Japan. The number of individuals taken each year increased following the 1980s moratorium on whaling of larger cetacean species. In 1988, more than 45,000 Dall&#x27;s porpoises were harpooned. In 1990, after international attention was drawn to the issue, the Japanese government introduced a reduction on take. The hunt of Dall&#x27;s porpoises has been criticized by scientific committees which question the sustainability of large quotas on regional populations. It has been suggested that the assessment of these target populations is outdated and that there may be a regional population decline given the reported annual catch. As of the FY 2023, the Japanese government had authorized the hunting of Dall&#x27;s porpoise and True&#x27;s porpoise only in Hokkaido, Iwate, and Miyagi prefectures, with a total quota of 8,535 animals, of which 109 were actually hunted.

===Pollution===
Environmental contaminants, including dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are another threat to Dall&#x27;s porpoises. Pollutants accumulate in the blubber layer, and in high concentrations can reduce hormone levels, affect the reproductive system, and result in calf death.

==Conservation status==
Dall&#x27;s porpoise is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Levels of both bycatch and commercial hunting are likely underestimates because they account only for reported data; however, there is no evidence for a range-wide decline of the species.

The species is also listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), and, like all other marine mammal species, is protected in the United States under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).

<text>Fulbert of Chartres (; 952–970–10 April 1028) was the Bishop of Chartres from 1006 to 1028 and a teacher at the Cathedral school there. Fulbert may have been a pupil of Gerbert of Aurillac, who would later become Pope Sylvester II. He was responsible for the advancement of the Nativity of the Virgin&#x27;s feast day on September 8 and for one of the many reconstructions of the Chartres Cathedral. Most of the information available about him comes from letters he wrote to secular and religious figures between 1004 and 1028.

==Life==
There is no conclusive evidence as to the exact date or location of Fulbert&#x27;s birth; sources vary in listing dates from 952 to 970. As to his place of birth, most sources suggest northern France, possibly Picardy, although some say northern Italy. Sources do agree, however, that he was of humble birth. Information from several sources places him at the cathedral school in Rheims in the 980s, where one of his fellow students was the future King Robert II (the Pious) of France. In the early to mid-990s, Fulbert arrived at the cathedral school there. His position is variously described as schoolmaster or assistant. He also assumed some minor ecclesiastical roles in the cathedral but was not a monk. In 1004, he became a deacon, and in 1006 was appointed Bishop of Chartres, a position he maintained until his death on 10 April 1028 or 1029. Again, sources vary, but the majority seem to settle on 1028. There is some dispute over Fulbert&#x27;s sainthood, which arises from his contemporaries describing him as having a &quot;saintly nature&quot;, a description which continued to be used by others after his death. Fulbert was never officially canonized by the Church, but permission was given by Rome for the dioceses of Chartres and Poitiers to celebrate his life on 10 April.

His feast is included in Martyrologium Romanum (2004) on 10 April.

It has been asserted that he was a disciple of Gerbert of Aurillac, but the matter has raised controversy.

==Writings==

===Letters===
Letters constitute the bulk of writings that can be verifiably attributed to Fulbert. His most famous letter was to Duke William V of Aquitaine on the duties of feudal lord and vassal. He also wrote to fellow churchmen on a variety of liturgical issues including the appointment of bishops, excommunication, and obedience. His letters also include correspondence about mundane issues of everyday life such as thanking people for medicine and setting up meetings. These letters provide insight into a variety of issues in the late tenth and early eleventh century France.

===Poems===
Fulbert wrote approximately twenty-four poems which have sometimes been described as humorous, such as his poem about the monk in the desert, or lovely, as when describing his “Ode to the Nightingale”.

===Hymns===
Most of Fulbert&#x27;s hymns were written to glorify the Virgin. He also wrote “Chorus Novae Jerusalem” (Ye Choirs of New Jerusalem), to be sung at Easter services.

===Sermons===
Fulbert&#x27;s most famous sermon is “ Approbate Consuetudinis”, in which he provides information regarding the importance of the celebration of the “Feast of Mary’s Nativity”.

==Theological contributions==
Like the recent millennium change, the one during Fulbert&#x27;s lifetime also created a fear of the end of the world. The veneration of the Virgin Mary was already established in the Church, and Fulbert used this to teach her importance. The results were twofold, it helped to ease people&#x27;s fears and greatly expanded the Marian Cult and Chartres&#x27;s position in it. Chartres was already involved due to its being the holder of a sacred relic of Mary&#x27;s, the “Sancta Camisia”, (Holy Tunic), which has been variously described as being worn by Mary during the Annunciation or during the birth of Christ. This tunic was already the subject of a miracle because of its use by an earlier bishop of Chartres, Gauscelinus, in 911 to ward off the invading Normans. Fulbert expanded on the theme of miracles involving Mary, especially those cases where she had interceded between sinners and God. In this way people could pray for Mary&#x27;s intercession with God on their behalf in the perceived coming apocalypse. Fulbert himself was involved in one of these miracles; when he was gravely ill Mary had healed him with a drop of milk because of his devotion to her. This also served to give Mary the image of not only the mother of Christ, but for all who believed in her, their mother too. All of this led to Fulbert&#x27;s ultimate goal of promoting a special feast day to celebrate Mary&#x27;s Nativity.

To gain popular support for this feast, Fulbert wrote his famous sermon “Approbate Consuetudinis” in which he relates Mary&#x27;s miracles. He also brings in the evidence of Mary&#x27;s family lineage, which the Bible traces back to King David. In his sermon Fulbert used the symbolism of the “Stirps Jesse” (Tree of Jesse) to help explain Mary&#x27;s familial relationship to the great men of the past and how it was determined, as described in Scripture, that she would be the one to whom Christ would be born. This again served to enhance her importance to the world and convince people of the need to celebrate her birth. This sermon led to a number of liturgical changes throughout the next few centuries in Europe. The sermon itself, or variations of it, and the chants associated with it, became part of the service for the feast day of Mary&#x27;s Nativity on Sept. 8. By promoting the Feast day of Mary&#x27;s Nativity, Fulbert was able to advance the importance of Mary and therefore the cult of her veneration grew. This in turn enhanced the importance of the Cathedral of Chartres as a centre for Marian devotion, and also gave people a spiritual symbol to turn to in times of need at the turn of the millennium.

==Ecclesiastical reform==
During his time in Chartres Fulbert played an important role in the development and spread of the ideas that led to the Gregorian church reforms of the eleventh century under Pope Gregory VII. These reforms concerned the division between the powers of church and state, especially in the appointment of new abbots and bishops. In the eleventh century the secular rulers had a habit of appointing whomever they wanted to fill vacant church positions. Fulbert and some of his students, such as Abbot Albert of Marmoutier, routinely wrote that it was up to the clergy and the citizens of the diocese involved to elect a replacement, the authority being found in the rulings of the First Council of Nicaea (325) and the Council of Antioch (264-272). These reforms also stated that the Church, not the state, was responsible for disciplining the clergy. The issues of simony (the buying of church offices) and immoral clerics were also addressed by Fulbert. Although the reforms were issued by Gregory VII, some of its ideas came from Fulbert, whose writings were disseminated through his students.

==Architectural contributions==
After Chartres Cathedral burned in 1020, Fulbert devoted his energies to raising funds for its rebuilding, which was completed in 1037, nine years after his death. In 1194 the cathedral was again almost completely destroyed by fire; only the crypt, some of the west facade and two towers remained. The crypt has been incorporated into all subsequent reconstructions. The construction of the Gothic-style cathedral that stands to-day began afterward. It is in this cathedral that we see Fulbert&#x27;s influences that resulted from his promotion of the Feast day of Mary&#x27;s Nativity and the cult of the Virgin Mary. The sculptures around the three portals depict the life of Mary, who is the central figure in the Royal Portal. One of the cathedral&#x27;s stained glass windows depicts the Tree of Jesse, which traces Mary&#x27;s family and the Holy Family, again a reference to Fulbert&#x27;s teachings in regards to the Feast of Mary&#x27;s Nativity.

<text>An own goal occurs in sports when a player performs actions that result in scoring points for the opposition, such as when a footballer puts a ball into their own net.

In some parts of the world, the term has become a metaphor for &quot;any&quot; action that backfires on the person or group undertaking it, sometimes even carrying a sense of &quot;poetic justice&quot;. During The Troubles, for instance, it acquired a specific metaphorical meaning in Belfast, referring to an IED (improvised explosive device) that detonated prematurely, killing the person making or handling the bomb with the intent to harm others.

A player trying to throw a game might deliberately attempt an own goal. Such players run the risk of being sanctioned or banned from further play.

==Association football==

In association football, an own goal occurs when a player causes the ball to go into their own team&#x27;s goal, resulting in a goal being scored for the opposition. Defenders often &quot;turn behind&quot; dangerous balls into the penalty area, particularly crosses, by kicking or heading the ball out of play behind their goal-line. In this way, the defender&#x27;s aim is to concede a corner rather than giving attacking players scoring opportunities. Consequently, the defender may misjudge and inadvertently turn the ball into their own goal, particularly if they are under pressure from attacking players who might otherwise score. While the defending player who scored the own goal is personally &quot;credited&quot; with the goal as part of the statistical abstract of the game (with the annotation &quot;(og)&quot; to indicate its nature), own goals are not added to a player&#x27;s seasonal or career goalscoring total.

The Laws of the Game currently stipulate that an own goal cannot be scored directly from most methods of restarting the game; instead, a corner kick is awarded to the attacking team. This is also the case for the kick-off, and goal kick, dropped-ball (since 2012), throw-in, corner kick, and free kick (indirect and direct).

The Laws do not stipulate any rules or procedures for crediting goals to players, and indeed such records are not a compulsory part of the game. In 1997 FIFA issued detailed guidelines for crediting own goals, recognising the increasing commercial importance of statistics such as top scorer awards and fantasy football. The guidelines state that credit for scoring is decided by the referee, or match commissioner if present; and &quot;[a] defender&#x27;s intervention must be deliberate in order for an own goal to be registered against him&quot;. Regarding a shot which deflects or ricochets into the goal off a defender, some sources credit the score to the attacker; others count them as own goals; for others it depends on whether the original shot was off target; others are more nuanced. There was controversy in 2013 when the Premier League credited Tim Howard with an own goal when a shot came off the post, hit him in the back, and went in.

Major competitions may have video reviews which can alter the accreditation, such as the Dubious Goals Committee of the FA Premier League. In the 2002 FIFA World Cup, one of Ronaldo&#x27;s eight goals in winning the Golden Boot was initially credited as an own goal but reassigned on appeal by Brazil. UEFA&#x27;s review procedure was formalised in 2008. , the English Football League allowed the club which scored to nominate the scorer, which &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticized with an example from 2002: &quot;every single national newspaper, agency and football factbook agreed that Coventry City defender Calum Davenport had scored an own goal against Burnley. The Clarets, however, gave the goal to Gareth Taylor&quot;.

The most own goals by a player is held by Irish footballer Richard Dunne with 10 own goals in his career and the most own goals by a club is held by English team Everton F.C. The most infamous own goal was perhaps that of Andrés Escobar from Colombia in the 1994 FIFA World Cup which ended in a 2–1 loss against the United States and knocked Colombia out; a week later, Escobar was shot dead in Colombia by a drug gang member whose boss had lost betting on the match.

The fastest own goal in history is believed to have been scored by Torquay United defender Pat Kruse, eight seconds into a match against Cambridge United in January 1977.

Another notable own goal was scored in a 1994 Caribbean Cup match between Barbados and Grenada. To advance in the competition Barbados needed to win by a margin of 2 or more goals. Because they were winning by just one goal as the match was nearly over, they deliberately scored an own goal to take the match into extra time to give themselves an opportunity to score a goal in extra time. Due to unusual tournament rules, this would not only win the game but also be worth 2 goals allowing them to advance on goal difference.

The most own goals scored in a match was 149 when SO Emyrne deliberately scored 149 own goals for AS Adema due to a protest to a refereeing decision. The final score ended as 149–0; it was the biggest loss in a top division match.

==Ice hockey==
If a goal is scored by a player on the defending team, credit for the goal goes to the last player on the other team to have touched the puck; this is because own goals in hockey are typically cases where the player so credited had the shot deflected, but this convention is used even where this is not the case. Occasionally, it is also credited to the closest player to the goal from the other team if he is determined to have caused the opposing player to shoot it into the wrong net. Assists are not awarded on an own goal because the defending team has possession of the puck between any pass and the goal itself. Occasionally in the National Hockey League, players have directed the puck into their own empty net, either late in the game or because of a delayed penalty call. This was the situation which resulted in Billy Smith of the New York Islanders becoming the first goaltender to receive credit for a goal in the NHL. Indeed, of the 16 goals scored by goaltenders in the NHL, 7 were the result of an own goal.

==Field hockey==
Treatment of &quot;own goals&quot; in field hockey has varied over recent years. In 2013 the International Hockey Federation (FIH) implemented a &quot;mandatory experiment&quot; such that a deflection of a shot from outside the shooting circle from a defender would be equivalent to a touch from an attacker, and thus if the shot continued into the goal the score would be counted. This proved unpopular and the change was reversed.

Presently rule 8.1 states that &quot;A goal is scored when the ball is played within the circle by an attacker and does not travel outside the circle before passing completely over the goal-line and under the crossbar.&quot; Added clarification: &quot;The ball may be played by a defender or touch their body before or after being played in the circle by an attacker.&quot; Thus, an &quot;own goal&quot; may occur, but in such situations the goal will likely be credited to the attacker whose initial play into the circle was necessary for the goal to stand.

==Basketball==
When accidentally scoring at an opposing team&#x27;s basket (basketball&#x27;s equivalent of an &quot;own goal&quot;), the goal is credited to an offensive player. One typical own-goal scenario occurs when a player tries to block a goal shot but ends up knocking the ball into the goal.

In NFHS basketball, the two points are merely listed for the scoring team, as a footnote.

In NCAA basketball, the rules state: &quot;When a player scores a field goal in the opponent&#x27;s basket, it shall count two points for the opponent regardless of the location on the playing court from where it was released. Such a field goal shall not be credited to a player in the scorebook but shall be indicated with a footnote.&quot;

In NBA rules, the goal is credited to the player on the scoring team who is closest to defensive shooter and is mentioned in a footnote.

Under FIBA rules, the player designated captain is credited with the basket, though deliberate own goals are a violation and do not score any points.

Due to point differential tiebreaker rules, there are at least two instances of players from the leading team deliberately attempting to score in the opponent&#x27;s basket to force an overtime. These were in the Philippines&#x27; 67–65 quarterfinal group match win over Kazakhstan in the 2014 Asian Games and in Georgia&#x27;s 96–94 group stage victory over the Philippines in the 2024 Riga FIBA Men&#x27;s Olympic Qualifying Tournament. To advance to their respective semifinals, the Philippines needed to win by 11 or more points against Kazakhstan, and Georgia had to win by 19 or more points against the Philippines.

==American football==
When a ball carrier is tackled or exits the field of play within the end zone being defended by his team, the result is a safety and the opposing team is awarded two points, and receives the ball after a free kick taken at the twenty-yard line (this does not apply if the ball carrier secures possession of the ball in the end zone as a result of an interception or a kick; in that case, no points are awarded and the play is considered a touchback).

A true &quot;own goal&quot;, in which the team place kicks or drop kicks the ball through their own goal posts (which has never happened at any level in football history and would require either a very strong headwind or a deliberate act of sabotage), is treated as any other backward kick in most leagues&#x27; rule books. Backward kicks are treated as fumbles, and as such, a backward kick through the back of the end zone, including through the goal posts, is scored as a safety. This occurred in a 2012 game between two Texas high schools; a punter kicked against a strong wind that blew the ball backward into the end zone, where the defense took control of it.

On two occasions, players disoriented after recovering a fumble have returned the ball into their own teams&#x27;s end zone, believing they had scored a touchdown only to see the other team receiving a safety. Roy Riegels took a ball 69 yards (more than half the length of the field) to his own end zone during the 1929 Rose Bowl while playing for the University of California, and in 1964 Minnesota Vikings&#x27; defensive lineman Jim Marshall went 66 yards pursued by his own teammates in an attempt to prevent him from scoring two points for the San Francisco 49ers. Both men have been remembered for those blunders despite accomplished careers otherwise.

In the final minutes of a game, a team may take a deliberate safety in order to get the free kick, rather than punting from the end zone, or to otherwise run out the clock. In 2003, the New England Patriots came back to win a game after giving a safety that put them three points behind. Similarly, the Baltimore Ravens took a safety with twelve seconds left in Super Bowl XLVII instead of punting out of the end zone, cutting their lead to three points but winning the game since they were able to burn eight seconds off the clock with the safety play, and the opposing San Francisco 49ers were unable to score on the ensuing free kick.

==Canadian football==
In Canadian football, if a scrimmage kick (punt or missed field goal attempt) is kicked into the end zone and the opponent does not advance it out, the kicking team is awarded a single, worth one point.

In the 2017 Grey Cup, the Calgary Stampeders deliberately took a safety when their punter Rob Maver, having lost control of a high snap, was faced with loss of down deep in his own territory. He intentionally kicked the ball backwards through the back of his own end zone for a safety.

==Gaelic football==
Gaelic footballers can play the ball with their hands; therefore, they have a much greater degree of control over the ball and thus, own goals are much rarer than they are in association football. They do occur, and two were scored by Mayo in the drawn 2016 All-Ireland SFC Final.

As an own goal is scored when the ball goes under the crossbar, so an &quot;own point&quot; is scored (like any other point) when the ball goes over the crossbar. However, when a shot on goal is deflected over the bar by the defending team, the point is credited to the attacker who shot and not considered an &quot;own point&quot;. Genuine examples of own points are very rare; one was scored by Stefan Connolly in the Cavan championship in 2015, while Seanie Malone scored an own point in the final of the 2019 Clare Senior Football Championship.

==Hurling==
Kildare player Niall Ó Muineacháin scored an own goal against London in the opening minute of the 2022 Christy Ring Cup contest. Lancashire GAA corner back Phil Shine also has the unfortunate title of scoring an own goal in the opening round of the Lory Meagher Championship against Longford in 2023.

==Australian rules football==

As a legitimate defensive play, an Australian rules football defender may concede an &quot;own score&quot;. Such a score, referred to as a &quot;rushed behind&quot; and statistically credited to no player (score sheets simply include the tally of rushed behinds), results in the opposition team scoring one point. A defending player may choose to concede a rushed behind when the risk of the opposition scoring a goal (worth six points) is high. It is impossible for a team to concede an own goal worth six points.

== Cricket ==

The hit wicket method of dismissal in cricket has been compared to the own goal concept, as it involves a batter getting themselves out (eliminated from play) with no involvement from the other team.

<doc id="380004" wikidata="Q60476" url="?curid=380004" title="Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana">
<text>The Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana (, also the Order of the Cross of St. Mary&#x27;s Land) was instituted by the President of Estonia, Lennart Meri, on 16 May 1995 to honour the independence of the Estonian state. (The Latin name &quot;Terra Mariana&quot;, meaning the &quot;Land of Mary&quot; was the official name for Medieval Livonia and designated the area which includes what is now Latvia and southern Estonia in medieval times.)

The Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana is bestowed upon the President of the Republic. Presidents of the Republic who have ceased to hold office keep the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana. The Collar of the Order was used &quot;de facto&quot; as the badge of office of the President of the Republic, since Soviet authorities took the original presidential collar, that of the Order of the National Coat of Arms, out of Estonia after the Soviet occupation of Estonia in 1940; it remains in the Kremlin in Moscow. A new collar of that order was made in 2008.

The Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana is also given as a decoration of the highest class to foreigners who have rendered special services to the Republic of Estonia. As such it is the highest and most distinguished order granted by Estonia to non-Estonian citizens.

==Classes==

The Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana comprises six classes:
* One special class – The Collar of the Cross of Terra Mariana;
* Five basic classes – 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th class.

The crosses and shields of all the classes of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana have the same design and are of the same size.

The blue colour tone of the moiré ribands belonging to the decorations of all the classes of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana is determined according to the international PANTONE colour-table as 300 C.

<text>Origin Systems, Inc. was an American video game developer based in Austin, Texas. It was founded on March 3, 1983, by Richard Garriott and his brother Robert. Origin is best known for their groundbreaking work in multiple genres of video games, such as the &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Wing Commander&quot; series. The company was purchased by Electronic Arts in 1992.

==History==
Brothers Richard and Robert Garriott, their astronaut-engineer father Owen, and programmer Chuck Bueche founded Origin Systems in 1983 because of the trouble they had collecting money owed to Richard for his games released by other companies. Origin was initially based in the Garriotts&#x27; garage in Houston, Texas. The company&#x27;s first game was &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot;; because of Ultima&#x27;s established reputation and the fact that the company&#x27;s games were released on computers and not consoles, Origin survived the video-game crash of 1983 which affected console game developers in North America. It published many non-&quot;Ultima&quot; games, and Richard Garriott claimed that he received the same royalty rate as other developers.

By 1988, Origin had 15 developers in Austin, Texas, and another 35 employees in New Hampshire. By 1989 they had 50 employees between their New Hampshire and Texas offices. By 1992, Origin Systems had sold more than software units worldwide.

In September 1992, Electronic Arts acquired the company for $35 million in stock, despite a dispute between the two companies over EA&#x27;s 1987 game &quot;Deathlord&quot;. Origin, with about $13 million in annual revenue, stated that it had considered an IPO before agreeing to the deal.

By 1996, Origin had expanded to more than 300 employees, most of whom were divided among small, largely autonomous development teams. In 1997, Origin released one of the earliest graphical MMORPGs, &quot;Ultima Online&quot;. After this title, Electronic Arts decided that Origin would become an online-only company after the completion of &quot;Ultima IX: Ascension&quot; in 1999. However, within a year&#x27;s time, in part due to &quot;Ultima IX&quot;″s poor reception, EA canceled all of Origin&#x27;s new development projects, including &quot;Ultima Online 2&quot;, &quot;Privateer Online&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter Online&quot;. Richard Garriott left Origin shortly after and founded Destination Games in 2000.

In later years, Origin mainly existed to support and expand &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and to develop further online games based on the &quot;Ultima&quot; franchise such as &quot;Ultima X: Odyssey&quot;, originally to be released in 2004 but later canceled. In February 2004, the studio was disbanded by Electronic Arts. The &quot;Longbow&quot; series of simulation games was developed at Origin and published under the &quot;Jane&#x27;s Combat Simulations&quot; brand of Electronic Arts. A follow-on project, &quot;Jane&#x27;s A-10&quot;, was under development when the project was canceled in late 1998 and the team moved to other projects.

<doc id="380008" wikidata="Q458526" url="?curid=380008" title="Probably approximately correct learning">
<text>In computational learning theory, probably approximately correct (PAC) learning is a framework for mathematical analysis of machine learning. It was proposed in 1984 by Leslie Valiant.

In this framework, the learner receives samples and must select a generalization function (called the &quot;hypothesis&quot;) from a certain class of possible functions. The goal is that, with high probability (the &quot;probably&quot; part), the selected function will have low generalization error (the &quot;approximately correct&quot; part). The learner must be able to learn the concept given any arbitrary approximation ratio, probability of success, or distribution of the samples.

The model was later extended to treat noise (misclassified samples). 

An important innovation of the PAC framework is the introduction of computational complexity theory concepts to machine learning. In particular, the learner is expected to find efficient functions (time and space requirements bounded to a polynomial of the example size), and the learner itself must implement an efficient procedure (requiring an example count bounded to a polynomial of the concept size, modified by the approximation and likelihood bounds).

== Definitions and terminology ==
In order to give the definition for something that is PAC-learnable, we first have to introduce some terminology.

For the following definitions, two examples will be used. The first is the problem of character recognition given an array of formula_1 bits encoding a binary-valued image. The other example is the problem of finding an interval that will correctly classify points within the interval as positive and the points outside of the range as negative.

Let formula_2 be a set called the &quot;instance space&quot; or the encoding of all the samples. In the character recognition problem, the instance space is formula_3. In the interval problem the instance space, formula_2, is the set of all bounded intervals in formula_5, where formula_5 denotes the set of all real numbers.

A &quot;concept&quot; is a subset formula_7. One concept is the set of all patterns of bits in formula_3 that encode a picture of the letter &quot;P&quot;. An example concept from the second example is the set of open intervals, formula_9, each of which contains only the positive points. A &quot;concept class&quot; formula_10 is a collection of concepts over formula_2. This could be the set of all subsets of the array of bits that are skeletonized 4-connected (width of the font is 1).

Let formula_12 be a procedure that draws an example, formula_13, using a probability distribution formula_14 and gives the correct label formula_15, that is 1 if formula_16 and 0 otherwise.

Now, given formula_17, assume there is an algorithm formula_18 and a polynomial formula_19 in formula_20 (and other relevant parameters of the class formula_10) such that, given a sample of size formula_19 drawn according to formula_12, then, with probability of at least formula_24, formula_18 outputs a hypothesis formula_26 that has an average error less than or equal to formula_27 on formula_2 with the same distribution formula_14. Further if the above statement for algorithm formula_30 is true for every concept formula_31 and for every distribution formula_14 over formula_2, and for all formula_34 then formula_10 is (efficiently) PAC learnable (or &quot;distribution-free PAC learnable&quot;). We can also say that formula_18 is a PAC learning algorithm for formula_10.

== Equivalence ==
Under some regularity conditions these conditions are equivalent: 

# The concept class &quot;C&quot; is PAC learnable.
# The VC dimension of &quot;C&quot; is finite.
# &quot;C&quot; is a uniformly Glivenko-Cantelli class.
# &quot;C&quot; is compressible in the sense of Littlestone and Warmuth

<text>The Time Ships is a 1995 hard science fiction novel by Stephen Baxter. A canonical sequel to the 1895 novella &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by H. G. Wells, it was officially authorized by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original&#x27;s publication. &quot;The Time Ships&quot; won critical acclaim. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award and the Philip K. Dick Award in 1996, as well as the British Science Fiction Association Award in 1995. It was also nominated for the Hugo, Clarke and Locus Awards in 1996.

==Plot summary==
After the events related in &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, the Time Traveler (his first name, Moses, is given in the novel but applied to the Time Traveler&#x27;s younger self) prepares, in 1891, to return to the year 802,701 and save Weena, the Eloi who died in the fire with the Morlocks. He reveals that the quartz construction of the time machine is suffused with a radioactive substance he calls Plattnerite for the mysterious benefactor who gave him the sample to study twenty years earlier, in 1871.

The Time Traveler departs into the future and stops in AD 657,208 when he notes the daytime sky has gone permanently dark. He arrives and is abducted by a branch of Morlocks more culturally advanced than the ones he met before. One of their number, Nebogipfel (the name of a character from Wells&#x27; &quot;The Chronic Argonauts&quot;), explains after hearing the Time Traveler&#x27;s own story that the conflict between Eloi and Morlocks never occurred due to the Writer&#x27;s publication of the story that became &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. The timeline he sought to go to is inaccessible to him now. The Morlocks of this timeline have constructed a Dyson sphere around the inner Solar System and use the Sun&#x27;s energy to power it. Humans as the Time Traveler knows them live on the sunlit inner surface of the Sphere while the Morlocks live on the outer shell. The Time Traveler convinces Nebogipfel that he will help him understand the time travelling mechanism of the time machine if the Morlock takes him back to it.

When he thinks he is unobserved, the Time Traveler reactivates his machine and travels to 1873 to persuade his younger self to stop his research on Plattnerite. Nebogipfel, who took hold of the Time Traveler once he realized what he was doing, follows him there. As the Time Traveler attempts to persuade his younger self, whom he calls &quot;Moses&quot; to avoid confusion, to stop his research by providing Nebogipfel as proof that reality is changed by time travel, a tank-like &quot;Juggernaut&quot; pulls into Moses&#x27; yard. The army personnel on board, commanded by Hilary Bond and accompanied by an older version of the Time Traveler&#x27;s friend Filby, take Moses, Nebogipfel, and the Time Traveler to &quot;their&quot; 1938, where World War I has stretched over twenty-four years due to the discovery of time travel which was influenced by the latter&#x27;s work. Britain&#x27;s major cities are all encased in Domes, and with the contributions of Austrian expatriate Kurt Gödel, the government hopes to win the war by altering Germany&#x27;s history conclusively.

Nebogipfel explains to the Time Traveler that they&#x27;ve entered another future as a result of their actions in Moses&#x27; past. During another bombing raid on London by the Germans, Gödel provides a vial of Plattnerite and leads them to the only escape available, a Time-Car prototype. Upon hearing this and what society would be like after the war (a pessimistic view mirroring Wells&#x27; own), the Time Traveler and Nebogipfel mount the vehicle and insert the Plattnerite. Moses is killed in an explosion when he tries to save Gödel, and the Time-Car travels back to the Paleocene and is wrecked on a tree. After weeks of bare survival, the Time Traveler and Nebogipfel are discovered by a scouting party from the Chronic Expeditionary Force commanded by Hilary Bond that arrived from 1944 to find them based on their remains in &quot;her&quot; time. Some time later, a German Messerschmitt plane arrives over the campsite, drops a &quot;Carolinum&quot; bomb (analogous to an atomic bomb in our world; see Wells&#x27; &quot;The World Set Free&quot;), and devastates the time-traveling Juggernauts and all but twelve of the Force. Nebogipfel and the Time Traveler survive by hiding in the ocean.

Over the next year and a half, the stranded soldiers under Hilary Bond&#x27;s command start the colony of First London. In off moments, Nebogipfel has worked on repairing the Time-Car and acquired shavings of Plattnerite to power it on a journey through time. When the Time-Car is ready, the Time Traveler joins Nebogipfel in a fifty-million year journey through which they see First London expand and develop colonies on the moon and in Earth orbit. Eventually, human tampering with the Earth&#x27;s environment renders the planet uninhabitable, and humanity departs for the stars. When the Time-Car finally stops due to depletion of its Plattnerite fuel, Nebogipfel and the Time Traveler are tended by a &quot;Universal Constructor&quot;, a life form (or lifeforms) composed of thousands of nanotechnological entities. They see that there are few stars left in the night sky; this is due to the human descendants colonizing many worlds and constructing Dyson Spheres around the host stars. The goal of the &quot;Universal Constructor&quot; is to harvest the energy of the sun to build time-travel vehicles from Plattnerite and travel to the beginning of the universe. However, this goal is not due to be completed for a million years.

Nebogipfel and the Time Traveler acquire enough Plattnerite from the Constructors to journey to the point in the future (i.e. another million years hence) when the Constructors will have finished building their time ships. Once the Time Traveler and Nebogipfel reach this point, the Constructors integrate them into a time ship and thus begins the journey back to time&#x27;s beginning. At this central point from where all matter and energy and timelines branch off, the Constructors apparently start a new history in which they become something even more grand and knowledgeable than before. These successors of the Constructors place the Time Traveler and Nebogipfel into the Time Traveler&#x27;s original history in the year 1871. It is revealed that the Time Traveler himself &quot;is&quot; the mysterious stranger who gave his younger self the Plattnerite sample under the alias &quot;Gottfried Plattner&quot;, and that because of this, the circle of causality is closed and thus, the whole multiplicity of histories which ends up creating the Constructors and their successors begins anew. Nebogipfel, with his consciousness enhanced by his time with the Constructors, leaves the Time Traveler behind to travel with the successors of the Constructors. These successors plan to travel &quot;beyond&quot; the &quot;local&quot; multiplicity into a new realm of historical dimensions.

The Time Traveler then makes one final journey to AD 802,701, along his historical axis, and just barely saves Weena from the death she suffered before. Since (the reader is led to suppose) travelling in time again would cause this reality to branch off and become inaccessible again, the Time Traveler destroys the machine and encourages the Eloi in an Agrarian Revolution to reduce their dependence on the Morlocks for food and clothing, hoping to one day eliminate it entirely. As he works, the Time Traveler writes down the recounting of his adventures and seals them in a Plattnerite packet, a &quot;time capsule&quot;, so to speak, in the hope that it will travel in time to a faithful scribe. Before sealing the packet, the Time Traveler writes that he plans to go into the world of the Morlocks again, hopefully to return and add an appendix to the story. The book ends by saying that no appendix was found.

==References to the works of H. G. Wells==
*The name Gottfried Plattner comes from &quot;The Plattner Story&quot; (included in Wells&#x27; collection of short stories entitled &quot;The Country of the Blind and Other Stories&quot;, written between 1894 and 1909, first published in 1911). There is no original link between this story and &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, nor does the account related to us by Baxter at the end of &quot;The Time Ships&quot; echo an event from &quot;The Plattner Story&quot;. In Wells&#x27; original story, Gottfried Plattner is given a full backstory including ancestry and occupation. He is a school teacher made to chemically analyze a &quot;green powder&quot; of uncertain origin by his students, and, upon lighting the powder on fire, is violently launched into a mysterious parallel dimension next to ours where mute &quot;Watchers of the Living&quot;, obviously deceased souls or alternate versions of existing people in our world, take keen interest in us.
*The Morlock Nebogipfel takes his name from Wells&#x27; story &quot;The Chronic Argonauts&quot;.
*In the London Dome, the characters are introduced to the Babble Machines, an entertainment/propaganda device, which originally appeared in Wells&#x27; &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;.
*Wells himself (as &quot;the Writer&quot;) is described as giving a lecture on a Babble Machine, and it is mentioned that he may have &quot;a great deal of influence on official thinking on &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot;&quot;.
*The dome is somewhat similar in concept to the post world war &quot;Bombproofs&quot; mentioned as existing in London after the second world war in &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; though this is on a much vaster scale. A similar design is reused by Baxter and Arthur C Clarke in their novel &quot;Sunstorm&quot;, for the vast dome used to shield London from the Storm of the novel&#x27;s title.
*When the London Dome is breached, the sound of the alarms is described as &quot;ulla, ulla, ulla&quot;, which is the cry of the Martian Tripods in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.
*In the Paleocene Age, the Time Traveler succumbs to a bacterial infection as his body is ill-adapted to the environment, much like the Martians in &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;.
*The people of the Green Moon are referred to as Selenites, as are the inhabitants of the moon in &quot;The First Men in the Moon&quot;.
* The novel suggests that the universe of the Time Traveler is not ours, but a slightly different one, coherent with Wells novels (whereas Nebogipfel&#x27;s original timeline created by the publication of the time traveler&#x27;s first travel in &quot;The Time-Machine&quot;, according to what he relates of it to the time traveler, appears to be much more similar to ours). Nuclear energy is produced by a material called &quot;carolinum&quot; and not uranium. Carolinum allows plattnerite to be produced relatively easily. Carolinum bombs, contrary to A-bombs, continue to detonate for years with an eerie purple glow. The name &quot;carolinum&quot; and the continuous detonation are references to &quot;The World Set Free&quot;.
* In the Palace of Green Porcelain, the Time Traveler views a model of a city resembling London as it is described in &quot;When the Sleeper Wakes&quot;.
* As the Time Traveler &#x27;re-enters&#x27; his body following the journey to the Origin of the Universe, much of the description recalls the ending of &quot;Under the Knife&quot;.

<text>Evolution is a collection of short stories that work together to form an episodic science fiction novel by author Stephen Baxter. It follows 565 million years of human evolution, from shrewlike mammals 65 million years in the past to the ultimate fate of humanity and its descendants, both biological and non-biological, 500 million years in the future.

==Plot==
===Protagonists in the Purga–human line===
Characters listed below descend from Purga and are either ancestral to or descended from humans.

Purga (65 Mya, Montana). A female &quot;Purgatorius&quot;. Despite being a shrew-like insectivore and barely self-aware, she is ancestral to all primates. After losing two mates and their litters to a &quot;Troodon&quot; attack and cannibalism, she manages to bear two pups. They witness the Chicxulub impact, although one of the pups is cooked alive and her mate succumbs to hypothermia. Purga and her surviving pup eventually arrive at a shore, where other &quot;Purgatorius&quot; are feeding on a dying &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;. Her pup joins them but Purga, now elderly and satisfied that her offspring will survive, retreats and dies in her burrow. She is fossilized and her tooth is discovered by Joan Useb in 2010.

Plesi (63 Mya, North America). A female plesiadapid. Although Earth is lush again, her species still looks very similar to &quot;Purgatorius&quot;. She has two pups and one of them is killed by an &quot;Oxyclaenus&quot;.

Noth (51 Mya, Ellesmere Island). A 2-year-old &quot;Notharctus&quot; male living with its herd in the Arctic forests. His species is lemur-looking, matriarchal and far more social, but still lacks a theory of mind. Noth wanders for weeks with his sister, surviving an attack on their family by a sociopathic fellow, Solo. They eventually find another herd, whose leader accepts Noth and his sister for defeating Solo and allows them to mate with the rest of the herd.

Capo (5 Mya, North African coast). A 40-year-old australopithecine dominant male living in the dry Mediterranean basin. His species has occasional consciousness, basic bipedalism, instinctive toolmaking and a theory of mind, but is incapable of teaching. As his forest is shrinking, Capo leads part of his group to a larger one, despite being ill-suited to cross the plains in between. However, it is already claimed by a bigger clan of their species and they are forced to live in the open plains and feed off carcasses.

Far (1.5 Mya, Rift Valley). A 9-year-old female hominid living with her tribe in the savannah. Her species is now fully bipedal and omnivorous, as well as surviving past their reproductive age to take important social roles. Forced by a grassland fire to take refuge in a jungle, she survives an attack by pithecines and eventually joins another hominid tribe, who use axes much to her amazement. She invents body painting while playing with ocher, allowing her to court Ax, a young male, and be accepted by the rest of the group.

Pebble (127 kya, Central Kenya). An 8-year-old neanderthal male. After his tribe is attacked, he leads the survivors and settle in the Mediterranean coast years later. There he meets Harpoon, a female modern human (&quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot;). Her tribe has more sophisticated huts and tools, as well as clothing and domesticated wolves. Trading seafood for tools, both tribes come together and Pebble and Harpoon mate. After swimming afloat logs to a nearby island, they exterminate the last &quot;Homo erectus&quot; there.

Mother or Ja-ahn (60 kya, Sahara). A 30-year-old woman living in the savannah. Schizophrenia allows her to understand causality, invent the spear-thrower and form simple sentences, which are quickly learned by the rest of her tribe. When her son dies, Mother murders her aunt believing that she was responsible through unseen means. The incident gives rise to superstition and Mother is regarded as a sage. Two more members are sacrificed due to Mother&#x27;s superstitions about blood and rain in an attempt to solve the drought. She eventually dies of cancer and is named Ja-ahn after their language&#x27;s word for &quot;mother&quot;, becoming the first human with a proper name, as well becoming mythicized.

Ejan (52 kya, Indonesia). A 20-year-old man. His people are the most ancient characters in the novel that speak normally. He lives with his ill mother and their increasingly crowded village. Ejan carves a canoe with his sister Rocha to sail to the southern landmass, becoming the first humans to set foot in Australia. Over the next millennium, people migrate there and the siblings become mythicized.

Jana (51 kya, Northwestern Australia). A 21-year-old man. He tries to court a girl but is not allowed to by her brothers due to his polio-struck leg. To hunt large game, he invents setting forests on fire and manages to trap a &quot;Genyornis&quot;. He returns with its head, impressing the village.

Jo&#x27;on (47 kya, New South Wales). A 40-year-old man partnered with Leda, a 39-year-old woman. As Leda&#x27;s brother uses flint to hunt better than with spears, she asks Jo&#x27;on to go the coast to obtain some.

Jahna (31 kya, Western France). A girl living in a settlement during the Ice Age. Her people&#x27;s village, cognitive capacity and culture are far more sophisticated than those of neanderthals, which they often abuse and exploit. While hunting, Jahna and her brother get lost when an ice storm breaks. Days later, they end up in the cave of a massive, 40-year-old neanderthal male, &quot;Old Man&quot;. Though superficially dangerous and unable to speak, Old Man takes care of them. However, a team led by their father eventually finds them and bludgeons Old Man in his sleep, amidst the children&#x27;s protests.

Juna (9.6 kya, Anatolia). A pregnant 15-year-old girl living in a village of hunter-gatherers undergoing famine. She accepts to become the slave of Cahl, the beer trader, to save her unborn child from being killed at birth. At Cahl&#x27;s hometown, Juna learns about agriculture and is put to work in the fields. Although food is plenty, monoculture means that the villagers&#x27; diet and health are poorer than those of hunter-gatherers. When tribute-collector Keram arrives, Juna learns about the city of Cata Huuk, and convinces him that she was kidnapped from there long ago. In part due to her much better appearance, Keram takes her with him, despite Cahl&#x27;s protests. Cata Huuk is Earth&#x27;s first city, and its leader, the Potus, the first king. Juna is made to dance naked for the Potus, and eventually partners up with Keram. He gives birth to her child and then Keram&#x27;s. After four years of plenitude, famine-caused revolts force the family to flee Cata Huuk. Along the way, Keram brings Juna to the ruins of her original and now measles-struck village, where she finds her sister as the sole survivor.

Athalaric (482 CE, Rome). The son of a barbarian slave, under the tutelage and in charge of the protection of Honorius, a venerable Roman bone collector. Visiting a Rome that is just a shadow of its former glory, the Persian trader Papak convinces them to join a Scythian collector in Petra. There, Honorius becomes so excited after acquiring a &quot;Homo erectus&quot; skull that he invites the entire group to a museum in Rome, where they misidentify a &quot;Protoceratops&quot; as a griffin. Honorius is confident that the remains prove that living beings were radically different in the past. Away on a cave expedition, Athalaric asks Honorius to become a priest on his father&#x27;s request, to lead Rome away from decay. Honorius however is not interested and is murdered by the henchmen of Athalaric&#x27;s father. His remains are buried next to Old Man&#x27;s.

Joan Useb (21st century). A paleontologist of San and European ancestry. In 2031, she is pregnant and flying to a conference in Rabaul on global warming, where she meets primatologist Alyce Sigurdardottir and Bex Scott, the genetically enhanced daughter of celebrity scientist Alison Scott. As protesters from the &quot;Fourth World&quot; disrupt the conference, the Rabaul caldera erupts, setting the sequence of events that collapse civilization. In the epilogue, set in 2049, a 52-year-old Joan and her 18-year-old daughter Lucy rescue feral children left behind in the Galápagos Islands due to the ensuing wars and toxic rain. Reflecting on humanity&#x27;s bleak future, Lucy asks Joan whether she has been happy and she responds affirmatively, based on the fact that unlike their ancestors, they have a glimpse into the past and can be certain that some form of life will survive into the far future.

Robert Wayne &quot;Snowy&quot; Snow (millennia from now, United Kingdom). A 31-year-old male military officer, genetically modified to facilitate cryogenic sleep. During the post-Rabaul wars, the United Nations deploys military officers in suspended animation worldwide to deter international invasions. Centuries later, officers Snowy, Ahmed, Sidewise, Bonner and Moon wake up and soon realize that human civilization has long collapsed. Ahmed, the leader, attempts to rebuild civilization, but with Moon being the only female, crops being long extinct and not knowing how to recreate even the most basic technology, Sidewise and Bonner agree that Ahmed&#x27;s plan is completely unrealistic. A month later, Snowy discovers that there actually are humans, now feral and without language. Internal conflicts distance Sidewise and Bonner, Moon disappears, Ahmed succumbs to mercury poisoning from fish, and Snowy chooses to spend the rest of his life following the feral people. As Snowy arrives to the coast of Sussex, he reflects on how everything humans ever made is gone now.

Remembrance (30 My from now, Western Africa). A monkey-like post-human female. The descendants of feral children have diversified into many non-sapient species, from everything resembling arboreal primates (Remembrance&#x27;s kind), eusocial moles, and elephants, the latter being &quot;farmed&quot; by rodents. They inhabit a lush forest, still having some artificial remains like bits of glass, bitumen and copper. Avoiding rodent and avian predators, Remembrance falls into a mole-folk pit, where she survives for several days. She eventually returns to the canopy, but soon the impact of Eros unleashes a mass extinction.

Ultimate (500 My from now, Montana). A capuchin-like post-human female inhabiting the barren deserts of Pangaea Ultima. Her species is closely symbiotic with borametz trees, which grow pods to sleep and nurse their young. Due to the harsh climate, the tree begins consuming Ultimate&#x27;s child, and she takes her to the desert, accompanied with her friend, Cactus. They come across the descendants of beetles, rats, lizards and toads, and Cactus is hunted by a huge, transparent salamander. A few days later, Ultimate arrives to the shores of a drying inland sea, where she finds the hardened footprints of one of her kind, both of them being the last &quot;human&quot; explorers. After returning and giving her child to the tree, Ultimate becomes the last primate to reproduce, and soon her herd and tree die. In the following eons Earth is consumed by the Sun, but hibernating bacteria are hurled into space and end up on the seas of a habitable exoplanet, setting up evolution again.

===Protagonists outside the Purga–human line===
Characters listed below are not ancestral to or descend from humans, although some are primates and thus descend from Purga.

Listener (145 Mya, Pangaea). A female &quot;Ornitholestes&quot; living with Stego, her mate. Unlike most animals in the book, they are fully sapient, with complex language, leather belts, whips, and a culture that revolves around &quot;Diplodocus&quot; hunting. Stego is killed by an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; during a hunt, and Listener swears to kill the &quot;Diplodocus&quot; matriarch that indirectly caused his death. Ten years later, she and her three sons manage to hunt the matriarch, which dooms the herd as well as the &quot;Ornitholestes&quot; settlement. They become extinct and humans never discover that another sapient species preceded them.

Roamer (32 Mya, North Africa). A female of a capuchin-like primate species unknown to paleontology. After a flood destroys her home, she finds herself and other members of her species on a haphazard raft on the Atlantic. Starvation and thirst nearly kill them, but Roamer and two other survivors eventually land on the rainforests of Yucatán and their descendants give rise to a new line of monkeys.

Dig (10 Mya, Antarctica). A female of a lemming-like primate species. The Antarctica she inhabits still has forests inhabited by the descendants of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Muttaburrasaurus&quot;. Though more temperate than today, the Antarctic forests are becoming progressively colder and more inhospitable. Ice caps completely bury the remains of Dig&#x27;s ecosystem and humans never discover that non-avian dinosaurs survived 55 million years longer than previously thought.

Johnnie (21st century, Mars). Humanity&#x27;s first self-replicating robot, which lands on Mars during Joan&#x27;s conference. Although its original purpose is to construct bases for human habitation, it stops receiving orders due to the chaos unleashed by Rabaul&#x27;s eruption on Earth and continues replicating itself unchecked. Within a few centuries, Johnnie&#x27;s descendants have consumed the planet entirely and leave the Solar System. As the self-replication process is imperfect, they begin undergoing a process akin to biological evolution. About 500 million years later, a self-aware probe arrives on Earth to investigate the origins of its kind. Although it encounters evidence of past intelligent activity, and even Ultimate —its creators&#x27; descendant— it considers its mission a failure and leaves.

==Reception==
Peter Cannon reviewing for &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; stated &quot;here is a rigorously constructed hard SF novel where the question is not whether humanity will reach the stars but how it will survive its own worst tendencies.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called this novel &quot;glum, dyspeptic, and depressing.&quot; Jackie Cassada said in her review for &quot;Library Journal&quot; that &quot;spanning more than 165 million years and encompassing the entire planet, Baxter&#x27;s ambitious saga provides both an exercise in painless paleontology and superb storytelling.&quot;

&quot;Evolution&quot; has been compared to Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s &quot;Last and First Men&quot;. Baxter has acknowledged Stapledon&#x27;s influence.

<text>The Order of the Cross of the Eagle (; ) was instituted in 1928 by the Estonian Defence League to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Estonian independence. It was adopted as a state order in 1936. The Order of the Cross of the Eagle is bestowed to give recognition for military services and services in the field of national defence. It is awarded in civil and military divisions. The awards made to members of the military are denoted by the addition of crossed swords to the decoration.

==Classes==

The Order of the Cross of the Eagle comprises eight classes:
* Five basic classes - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th class;
* Three medal classes - crosses in gold, silver and iron;

The crosses of all the classes of the Order of the Cross of the Eagle have the same design.

The colour tone of the orange moiré ribands belonging to the decorations of all the classes of the Order of the Cross of the Eagle is determined according to the international PANTONE colour-table as 137 MC.

The Order of the Cross of the Eagle is a military decoration if two crossed swords are affixed to it as follows:
*The cross has crossed swords movably attached at the hilts of the swords to the tips of the top arms of the cross. The length of the swords together with their hilts is 35 mm for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd class decorations and 33 mm for the 4th and 5th class decorations and the gold, silver and iron crosses;
*The star has crossed swords affixed to the oblique rays of the star and the vertical and horizontal rays remain uncovered. The swords are set hilts down. The length of each sword is 85 mm.
The medals of the affiliated crosses of the Order of the Cross of the Eagle have swords in the same metal as their cross.

<doc id="380041" wikidata="Q7997161" url="?curid=380041" title="Who Ate All the Pies?">
<text>&quot;Who Ate All the Pies?&quot; is a football chant sung by fans in the UK. It is usually sung to the tune of &quot;Knees Up Mother Brown&quot; and is aimed at overweight footballers, officials or other supporters.

==Background and origin==
The chant was first sung in 1894 by Sheffield United supporters, and directed at the club&#x27;s goalkeeper William &quot;Fatty&quot; Foulke, who weighed over . In his early career he played for Blackwell Colliery, subsequently playing for Sheffield United and Chelsea FC.

If the tune used was Knees up Mother Brown, then it is highly improbable that the chant originated with Foulke who retired in 1907 and died in 1916; Knees up Mother Brown originated in 1918. Also, Foulke weighed in 1894. According to sportswriters of the time, was nicknamed &quot;the lengthy one&quot; or &quot;the octopus&quot;; his weight gain came later.

==The lyrics==
The lyrics of the chant are:
: Who ate all the pies?
: Who ate all the pies?
: You fat bastard,
: You fat bastard,
: You ate all the pies!

A variation replaces the second line with &quot;The burgers and the fries.&quot;

==Adoption and inspiration==
Part of the song (the third line - &quot;You fat bastard&quot;) has been adopted by Roy &quot;Chubby&quot; Brown as his anthem and is enthusiastically chanted by the audiences during his stage performances.

This line was also chanted at gigs by 1990s indie band Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine; it is also included as the intro on their album &quot;30 Something&quot;. It was chanted at their manager Jon Fat Beast, who had a tendency to appear on stage stripped to the waist, displaying his ample abdomen.

American rock band Faith No More released a live album &quot;You Fat Bastards: Live at the Brixton Academy&quot;, so named after the crowd were heard singing the chant at the band&#x27;s show in April 1990.

The Vegetarian Society have used a variant of this, &quot;Who ate all the peas?&quot;, as a slogan. They displayed it on promotional hoardings in football grounds as part of their &quot;Men and Meat Campaign&quot;, intended to combat the idea that vegetarianism is unmanly.

The chant has been associated with the striker Micky Quinn, who played for six football clubs in the 1980s and 1990s. He was particularly identified with the chant following an incident in a match between Quinn&#x27;s then club Newcastle United and Grimsby Town in March 1992, in which a fan threw a pie onto the pitch which Quinn promptly picked up and ate. The chant even formed the title for Quinn&#x27;s autobiography, which was published in 2003.

During cricket matches, the chant is known to have been directed at players such as Shane Warne, by spectators belonging to the Barmy Army.

==Wayne Shaw controversy==
In a February 2017 incident dubbed &quot;piegate&quot;, 23-stone Sutton United goalkeeper Wayne Shaw was fined and suspended by the FA for breaching gambling laws, after he ate a pie during a match and then admitted he saw there were odds of 8/1 on him doing so and tipped off his friends.

<text>Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) is a liberal American political organization advocating progressive policies. ADA views itself as supporting social and economic justice through lobbying, grassroots organizing, research, and supporting progressive candidates.

==History==
===Formation===
The ADA grew out of a predecessor group, the Union for Democratic Action (UDA). The UDA was formed by former members of the Socialist Party of America and the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies as well as labor union leaders, liberal politicians, theologians, and others who were opposed to the pacifism adopted by most left-wing political organizations in the late 1930s and early 1940s. It supported an interventionist, internationalist foreign policy and a pro-union, liberal domestic policy. It was also strongly anti-communist. It undertook a major effort to support left-wing Democratic members of Congress in 1946, but this effort was an overwhelming failure. 

James Isaac Loeb – later an ambassador and diplomat in the John F. Kennedy administration – the UDA&#x27;s executive director, advocated disbanding the UDA and forming a new, more broadly based, mass-membership organization. The ADA was formed on January 3, 1947, and the UDA shuttered.

Among ADA&#x27;s founding members were leading anti-communist liberals from academic, political, and labor circles, including theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, union leader Walter Reuther, civil rights lawyer Joseph Rauh, and Hubert Humphrey. Its founders hoped to solidify a progressive, pragmatic, noncommunist &quot;vital center&quot; in mainstream politics, embodying Schlesinger&#x27;s concept formulated in his 1949 book &quot;The Vital Center&quot;.

===Action===
On April 3, 1948, ADA declared its decision to support a Democratic Party ticket of General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Supreme Court Judge William O. Douglas over incumbent U.S. President Harry S. Truman. Truman lacked popular support, and the ADA succeeded in pushing Truman leftward on issues such as civil rights. It also led a full-scale attack on Progressive Party candidate and former US vice president Henry A. Wallace because of his opposition to the Marshall Plan and support for a more conciliatory relationship with the Soviet Union. The ADA portrayed Wallace and his supporters as dupes of the Communist Party. Adolf A. Berle Jr. and Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. believed that Eisenhower would accept the nomination. He did not.

ADA supported Truman after his victory in the 1948 election.

Although anti-communist, unlike other contemporary liberal groups like the Progressive Citizens of America (PCA), which supported cooperation with the Soviet Union, the ADA was still subject to significant McCarthyist scrutiny. The plight of the ADA during that period prompted Eleanor Roosevelt to accept a position as honorary chair of the organization in 1953, and in doing so, put Senator McCarthy in a position in which he would have had to &quot;call her a communist as well&quot; to continue his inquiries into the activities of the group. Because of her actions, many ADA leaders credited her with saving the organization.

In the early 1960s, ADA&#x27;s influence peaked when a number of its key members (e.g. James Loeb, Arthur Schlesinger Jr.) were picked to join the administration of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. While active in liberal causes ranging from civil rights to Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Great Society reforms, by the mid-1960s the ADA&#x27;s influence was on the wane. It was badly split over the Vietnam War: initially supporting Johnson&#x27;s war policy, the ADA had come to oppose the war by early 1968. It endorsed founder Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s presidential candidacy that year, but with &quot;barely concealed ambivalence&quot;. After Richard Nixon&#x27;s victory, the ADA was pushed to the political margins, overshadowed by more centrist groups like the Trilateral Commission and Coalition for a Democratic Majority.

== Voting records ==
ADA ranks legislators, identifies key policy issues, and tracks how members of Congress vote on these issues. The annual ADA Voting Record gives each member a Liberal Quotient (LQ) rating from 0, meaning complete disagreement with ADA policies, to 100, meaning complete agreement with ADA policies. A score of 0 is considered conservative and a score 100 is considered liberal. The LQ is obtained by evaluating an elected official&#x27;s votes on 20 key foreign and domestic social and economic issues chosen by the ADA&#x27;s Legislative Committee. Each vote given a score of either 5 or 0 points, depending on whether the individual voted with or against the ADA&#x27;s position, respectively. Absent voters are also given a score of 0 for the vote.

<text>The Order of the National Coat of Arms (, ) was instituted by Konstantin Päts on 7 October 1936 to commemorate 24 February 1918, the day on which Estonian independence was declared. The Order of the National Coat of Arms is bestowed only on Estonian citizens, as a decoration of the highest class for services rendered to the state.

==Classes==
The Order of the National Coat of Arms comprises six classes:
* One special class – the Collar of the Order of the National Coat of Arms;
* Five basic classes – 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th class.

The greater national coat of arms as part of the decorations of all the classes of the Order of the National Coat of Arms, goldplated on both sides, bears on its reverse the embossed date &quot;24. II 1918&quot;. The colour tone of the blue moiré ribands belonging to the decorations of all the classes of the Order of the National Coat of Arms is determined according to the international PANTONE colour-table as 285 C.

==Collar==
The collar of the Order of the National Coat of Arms is a badge of the office of the President of Estonia. Until 2008, the collar was unique. As, however, Russians during the Soviet occupation had taken that collar to the Armory Chamber (&quot;Оружейная палата&quot;, &quot;Oruzhejjnaja palata&quot;) in the Moscow Kremlin as a trophy and never have returned the collar to Estonia, a newly made copy is again worn by the President of Estonia as a badge of office.

==Special sash==
Special sash (Riigivapi teenetemärgi erisuurpael) was received by Konstantin Päts after his accession to the post of the President of the Republic.

<doc id="380061" wikidata="Q755140" url="?curid=380061" title="Stratford, Connecticut">
<text>Stratford is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. It is situated on Long Island Sound at the mouth of the Housatonic River. The town is part of the Greater Bridgeport Planning Region, and the Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was settled by Puritans in 1639.

The population was 52,355 as of the 2020 census. It is bordered on the west by Bridgeport, to the north by Trumbull and Shelton, and on the east by Milford (across the Housatonic River). Stratford has a historical legacy in aviation, the military, and theater.

==History==

===Founding and Puritan era===
Stratford was founded in 1639 by Puritan leader Reverend Adam Blakeman, William Beardsley, and either 16 families (according to legend) or approximately 35 families (suggested by later research) who had recently arrived in Connecticut Colony from England seeking religious freedom. In 1639 the General Court in Hartford made reference to the town as the &quot;new plantation at Pequannock&quot;. In 1640 the community was known as Cupheag, a Native American Paugussett word meaning &quot;at the enclosed place&quot; or &quot;place of shelter&quot;. By April 13, 1643, the growing town was known as Stratford, changed to honor William Shakespeare&#x27;s birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon in England.

Stratford is one of many towns in the northeastern American colonies founded as part of the Great Migration in the 1630s when Puritan families fled an increasingly polarized England in the decade before the civil war between Charles I and Parliament. Some of the Stratford settlers were from families who had first moved from England to the Netherlands to seek religious freedom, like their predecessors on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, and decided to come to the New World when their children began to adopt the Dutch culture and language.

Like other Puritan or Pilgrim towns founded during this time, early Stratford was a place where church leadership and town leadership were united under the pastor of the church, in this case Reverend Blakeman. The goal of these communities was to create perfect outposts of religious idealism where the wilderness would separate them from the interference of kings, parliaments, or any other secular authority.

Blakeman ruled Stratford until his death in 1665, but as the second generation of Stratford grew up, many of the children rejected what they perceived as the exceptional austerity of the town&#x27;s founders. This and later generations sought to change the religious dictums of their elders, and the utopian nature of Stratford and similar communities was gradually replaced with more standard colonial administration. By the late 17th century, the Connecticut government had assumed political control over Stratford.

Many descendants of the original founding Puritan families remain in Stratford today after over 350 years; for centuries they often intermarried within the original small group of 17th century Pilgrim families. Despite its Puritan origins, Stratford was the site of the first Anglican church in Connecticut, founded in 1707 and ministered by the Rev. Dr. Samuel Johnson. Settlers from Stratford went on to found other American cities and towns, including Newark, New Jersey, established in 1666 by members of the Stratford founding families who believed the town&#x27;s religious purity had been compromised by the changes after Blakeman&#x27;s death. Other towns such as Cambria, New York (now Lockport, New York) were founded or expanded around new churches by Stratford descendants taking part in the westward migration. U.S. President Gerald Ford was a descendant of one of the Stratford founding families, that was led by William Judson.

===Towns created from Stratford===
Stratford was one of the two principal settlements in southwestern Connecticut, the other being Fairfield. Over time it gave rise to several new towns that broke off and incorporated separately. The following towns were created from parts of Stratford:
* Shelton (originally Ripton) in 1789. In 1789 Ripton Parish separated from Stratford and became the Town of Huntington.
:*Monroe created from Huntington in 1823
* Nichols (originally Unity in 1725, then North Stratford in 1744)
* Long Hill, (merged with Unity to form North Stratford in 1744)
:*Trumbull, North Stratford separated from Stratford and became the town of Trumbull in 1797
* Bridgeport (also partly from Fairfield) in 1821

===Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries===

A trolley was built connecting Lordship to Bridgeport in 1914, connecting the resort area to the neighboring city.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 11.52%, is water. Stratford has a minimum elevation of zero feet above sea level along its coastline, with a maximum altitude of near its northern border, and an average elevation of .

===Coastline and islands===
The town contains five islands, all in the Housatonic River. These are Carting Island, Long Island, Peacock Island, and Pope&#x27;s Flat north of Interstate 95, as well as Goose Island. None of these islands are habitable because of their low elevations. A sixth island known as Brinsmade Island washed away prior to 1964.

===Beaches===
Long Beach – Approximately long, the eastern end of the beach is open to the public and has parking and lifeguards. The central part of the beach is a nature preserve whose land is set aside for wildlife, particularly nesting raptors, such as American kestrels and ospreys. The western end of the beach was once the site of about 40 cottages, which were abandoned because of the town&#x27;s discontinuation of the lease to the land. The cottages were demolished in fall 2010.
Russian Beach – Located between Long and Short beaches, Russian Beach has parking and the Point-No-Point walkway. Fishing is allowed, as is swimming although this beach has no lifeguards.

Short Beach – Short Beach Park is in size and sits at the mouth of the Housatonic River. It has three picnic pavilions, basketball courts, tennis courts, volleyball courts, a handicapped-accessible playground, a skateboard park, a lighted softball field, a soccer field, two baseball fields and a lacrosse field. The beach has of frontage with a concession stand, bathrooms, a deck and lifeguards. The park is also home to Short Beach Golf Course, a nine-hole par-3 course.

===Great Salt Marsh===
The Great Meadows Unit of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge is a key bird migration stopover. The open water area of the Great Salt Marsh is known as Lewis Gut.

===Roosevelt Forest===
Located in the north end of Stratford, this site is primarily a mixed deciduous forest, with some wetlands and ponds. Named for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it was set aside in the 1930s, when much of the infrastructure was created as a Works Progress Administration project. The forest includes campsites with cooking pits, picnic tables, and walking trails.

===Superfund sites===

Stratford is the location of two Superfund sites designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. These include a variety of locations related to asbestos dumping and disposal by Raymark Industries, whose manufacturing was previously headquartered in Stratford, and the former Stratford Army Engine Plant. The Raymark site is on the EPA&#x27;s National Priorities List. Stratford Army Engine Plant is not on the National Priorities list, but is being cleaned up by the US Army.

From 1919 to 1989, Raymark manufactured brake pads and other friction products for the automobile industry under the name Raybestos. The company disposed of wastes containing lead, asbestos, PCBs and other hazardous substances at its Stratford manufacturing plant. Raymark dried the waste material and made it available for use as fill material for lawns, playgrounds, and schoolyards. In 1993, the EPA and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection began working together to complete the cleanup of contamination Raymark left behind in Stratford. EPA completed its cleanup of the contaminated residential properties in 1995 and the former Raymark plant property in 1997. Plans for cleanup of the Ferry Creek area and surrounding properties where additional Raymark waste was historically disposed are currently being developed by the EPA. The cost of cleaning up the Raymark Site is estimated to have exceeded $200 million.

===Sikorsky Aircraft===

Stratford is home to the headquarters of Sikorsky Aircraft, a Lockheed Martin (LMT) subsidiary founded by Igor Sikorsky, developer of the first successful American helicopter. Every Marine One (the helicopter of the President of the United States) has been manufactured in Stratford since 1957. On July 20, 2015, Lockheed Martin announced an agreement to purchase Sikorsky Aircraft from UTC for $9 billion.

===Stratford Army Engine Plant===
The Stratford Army Engine Plant (SAEP) was a U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command installation and manufacturing facility, located along the Housatonic River and Main Street opposite Sikorsky Airport. Because of the Base Realignment and Closure actions of the United States Department of Defense, closure of the plant was recommended in July 1995. The SAEP closed on September 30, 1998. For the next 11 years the Army was involved with &quot;Team Stratford&quot; to develop the property. The United States Army, which owns the site, auctioned it off on March 19, 2008, with a winning bid of $9,612,000 which also includes the facility of over fifty buildings. This bid failed to be paid off and is now being placed for rebid. Currently Robert Hartmann of Hartmann Development has a $1 billion plan to develop the former Army engine plant into a destination resort.

In February 2005, the Town of Stratford received the deed for the Stratford Festival Shakespeare Theater from the state of Connecticut.

<text>Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale, goose-beaked whale, or ziphius (Ziphius cavirostris) is the most widely distributed of all beaked whales in the family Ziphiidae. It is smaller than most baleen whales—and indeed the larger toothed cetaceans (like orca and sperm whales)—yet it is large among the beaked whales and smaller cetaceans, appearing somewhat like a bigger and stockier bottlenose dolphin. Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale is pelagic, generally inhabiting waters deeper than , though it has been observed closer to shore on occasion. In these offshore waters, Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales execute some of the deepest and longest recorded dives among whales, and extant mammals. The current published records are for dive depth and 222 minutes for dive duration as recorded by biologging instruments attached to individual whales. While likely diving to forage and hunt prey, such as cephalopods, and potentially evade predators (like the aforementioned orca), the frequency and exact reason for these extraordinary dives is unclear. Despite its deepwater habitat, it is one of the most frequently-spotted beaked whales when surfacing.

==Taxonomy==

French naturalist and zoologist Georges Cuvier first described the species in &quot;Recherches sur les ossements fossiles&quot; (&quot;Research on Fossil Bones&quot;, 1823) based on a skull collected on the Mediterranean coast of France at Fos-sur-mer, Bouches-du-Rhône, in 1804. He named it &quot;Ziphius cavirostris&quot; from the Latin &quot;cavus&quot; for &quot;hollow&quot;, or &quot;concave&quot;, referring to the prenarial basin, a deep hollow in the skull which is now known from only the males of the species.
Cuvier believed the skull represented the remains of an extinct species, and chose the genus name &quot;Ziphius&quot; to reflect another previously-undetermined species mentioned by historical authors. Later, in 1850, paleontologist and zoologist Paul Gervais found the skull to be identical to that of a stranded (beached) whale carcass he had just examined.

Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale is one of 24 extant (living) species in the family Ziphiidae, and the only extant member of the genus &quot;Ziphius&quot;, with the other member being the extinct &quot;Ziphius compressus&quot;. Uniquely, no other species of ziphiid cetacean develops such dense rostral ossification of its prenarial basin.

==Description==

The body of Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale is robust and cigar-shaped, similar to those of other beaked whales, and can be difficult to distinguish from many of the mesoplodont whales at sea. 
Males and females tend to be similar in size.
The body of adult males is typically a dark gray, with their head being distinctly lighter, or even white. This light coloration extends along the posterior. Females vary in color from dark gray to a reddish-brown. The skin lightens on female&#x27;s head to a lesser extent than in males, and does not extend along the posterior.

Sex determination in Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales can be on the basis of genetics, observation of the genital area, the presence or absence of erupted teeth in adults, or presence of a calf. Pigmentation patterns can also give indications of gender. Adult males show a contrasted uniform white cape which usually extends to the dorsal fin zone. Individual coloration in adult males varies from dark to almost white. However, more than a third of adult females show &quot;sharp&quot; pigmentation patterns similar to adult males. Therefore males and females of this pattern cannot be distinguished using pigmentation pattern alone. The majority of adult females show a &quot;soft&quot; cluster of pigmentation features characterized by a brownish coloration and a shorter contrasting white cape. However, similar patterns have been observed in subadult animals of both sexes, so a &quot;soft&quot; pigmentation pattern alone is insufficient evidence to conclude that an animal is female.

Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales at birth have a weight about and a length of . Calves are black or dark blue with a white belly. Females reach maturity at an average length of and males at , weighing about 2 to 3.5 tons.

Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale is an &quot;odontocete&quot; — or toothed whale. Erupted teeth are only present in the adult males. Males also develop two tusks in the right and left corners of their lower jaw. The tusks are possibly used for dueling between the males, though it has not been observed, but may also be used for fighting off threats such as orcas. Adults have many scars along their sides which can be used to identify individuals. The scars are thought, by researchers, to be from battles with males, predators, fights with squid, or cookiecutter sharks, which may score them or punch holes directly in their sides. The frequency of scarring is higher in males than in females, and tends to increase with age.

Their head is short and blunt, with a gradually sloping forehead, a small, poorly defined beak, and a slight melon. All the beaked whales have this general appearance, but Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale has a blunt shorter beak that distinguishes Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale from others in the family &quot;Ziphiidae&quot;. In profile, their small, softly defined rostrum gives them the nickname or alternative name of goose-beaked whale.

== Ecology ==

=== Diving ===
Satellite-linked tags have been used to track and study whale movement, with associated data suggesting that Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale follows a stereotypical dive pattern, often to a depth exceeding . These dives, likely to be hunting expeditions, may last from 15 to 30 minutes, though sometimes considerably longer, before re-ascending for oxygen replenishment. They typically only surface for air fleetingly (2 to 8 min), perhaps in an effort to evade orcas or great white sharks; however, infrequently, the species will spend extended periods at the surface (30 to 310 min). Deep dives are followed by several shorter, shallower dives. Diving behavior shows little diel variation.

Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale holds the records for both the deepest and the longest dives ever documented for any mammal; in 2014, scientists reported that Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale, off the coast of California, dove to below the ocean&#x27;s surface, becoming the deepest documented dive for any mammal. A study in 2020 reported Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale making a dive that lasted 222 minutes, the longest dive ever documented for any mammal. Supervising scientist Nicola Hodgkins noted that &quot;the recorded dive-time of more than three hours is likely not typical, and instead the result of an individual pushed to its absolute limits&quot;.

Like the similarly deep-diving sperm whales, it is possible that Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales have evolved modifications to their cardiovascular, metabolic, nervous and respiratory systems, among other adaptations, that enable them to make deep dives beyond their predicted aerobic capacity. Considering the species&#x27; ability to dive to almost , and remain underwater for over two hours, at times, there are suggestions that they may likely be able to collapse or flatten their rib cage, and possibly their heart, lungs or other organs, while simultaneously decreasing their heart rate while at-depth. They have been observed making a leaping flourish when entering a dive into the pelagic depths.

During shallow dives, Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales tend to be silent, possibly to avoid predators. Past , they use echolocation as a hunting aid. Exposure to high-frequency noises from anthropogenic sources, such as Navy sonar or explosives testing, appears to disrupt their behavior and has been linked to multiple mass stranding events, affecting hundreds of beaked whales.

===Food and foraging===
Relatively little is known of the diving and feeding behavior of Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales. There is evidence that Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales make highly coordinated foraging dives in small social groups. Such behavior may reduce predation risk; it does not appear to affect the whales&#x27; foraging success.

It appears that Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale prefers diving deep and using a suction process to acquire fish. Diving deep to catch prey, Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales open their jaws, expand their throat and move their tongue in a way that creates a pressure change and sucks their prey, like squid and deep sea fish, directly into their mouths. This species possess throat pleats, somewhat like a rorqual, that allows its throat to expand, presumably aiding in generating a stronger suction force. Like a dolphin, it appears to wear a permanent smile due to its jaw structure.

The &quot;melon&quot; of the whale, the bump on top of its head, contains its organ for echolocation. This means the whale can use sound waves to locate potential sources of food, which is helpful in the deep sea, where there is no sunlight. This deep diving with echolocation seems to help Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales avoid competition for their prey.

Scientists have used beached specimens to study the whale&#x27;s eating habits via stomach analysis. Examining Pacific Ocean whales, they found that cephalopods made up 98.0% (by number) and 87.7% (by mass) of Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale diet. Among these were at least 37 varieties of squid, of many different sizes, with both &quot;mesopelagic&quot; and &quot;bathypelagic&quot; squid. Prey of Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales include Cranchiidae, Onychoteuthidae, Brachioteuthidae, Enoploteuthidae, Octopoteuthidae, and Histioteuthidae, as well as deep-sea fish. 

Comparing the stomachs of the whales found in the Pacific Ocean to those found in the Mediterranean found that the Mediterranean whales predominantly ate squid from a 1,000 to 2,000-foot level, whereas in the Pacific, the whales found in Monterey, California in 2015, Taiwan in 1995, Alaska, and Baja California had access to much deeper water.

As well as catching prey in the benthopelagic zone, they consumed a mixture of crustaceans and cephalopods further down in the bathypelagic zone. Molluscs and octopus only found in these deep-sea regions are also sometimes eaten in the bathypelagic zone.
A whale retrieved in Monterey in 2015 was observed to have eaten 200 squids, five fish, and one very deep-sea shrimp. The shrimp and most of the squid were seemingly &quot;bathypelagic,&quot; and the fish were giant grenadiers off the &quot;benthopelagic&quot; ocean bottoms.

===Range and habitat===

Cuvier&#x27;s has a cosmopolitan distribution in deep, offshore waters from the tropics to the cool, temperate seas. In the North Pacific, it occurs as far north as the Aleutians and in the North Atlantic as far north as Atlantic Canada in the west to Shetland in the east. In the Southern Hemisphere, it occurs as far south as Tierra del Fuego, South Africa, southern Australia, New Zealand, and the Chatham Islands. It also frequents such inland bodies of waters as the Gulfs of Mexico and the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas. The Mediterranean population might be genetically distinct from the North Atlantic population(s).

Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale may be one of the most common and abundant of the beaked whales, with a worldwide population likely well over 100,000. An estimated 80,000 are in the eastern tropical Pacific, nearly 1,900 are off the west coast of the United States (excluding Alaska), and more than 15,000 are off Hawaii. The population in the Gulf of Mexico is extremely small and appeals have been made to have them made a protected species in this area. this was rejected on the basis that there was insufficient scientific evidence to consider them a distinct population segment (DPS) under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

==Interactions with humans==
=== Whaling and fishing ===
Before 1955, it is estimated that Japanese whalers caught anywhere from 3 to 35 Cuvier&#x27;s every year. From 1955 until the 1990s, more than 4,000 Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales were reportedly caught. The species has reportedly been caught incidentally in fisheries in Colombia, in the Italian swordfish fishery, and in a drift gillnet fishery off California and Oregon on the U.S. west coast, where between 22 and 44 individuals died each year from 1992 to 1995. Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).

=== Sonar and military maneuvers ===

Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale seems to have a bad reaction to sonar. Strandings and beachings often occur near naval bases where sonar may have been in use. Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whale has been observed in Hawaii avoiding diving for food or avoiding an area where sonar is in use. A higher incidence of strandings has been recorded in noisy seas such as the Mediterranean and multiple mass strandings have occurred following operations by the Spanish Navy in the Canary Islands. In 2019, a review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whales linked to naval exercises where sonar was used concluded the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations, and the strength of the whales&#x27; response may depend on whether the individuals had prior exposure to sonar. The report considered the most plausible explanation of the symptoms of decompression sickness such as gas embolism found in stranded whales to be the whales&#x27; response to sonar. It noted no more mass strandings had occurred in the Canary Islands once naval exercises using sonar were banned there, and recommended the ban be extended to other areas such as the Mediterranean, where mass strandings continue to occur.

<text>Robert Anderson (June 14, 1805 – October 26, 1871) was a United States Army officer during the American Civil War. He was the Union commander in the first battle of the American Civil War at Fort Sumter in April 1861 when the Confederates bombarded the fort and forced its surrender, starting the war. Anderson was celebrated as a hero in the North and promoted to brigadier general and given command of Union forces in Kentucky. He was removed late in 1861 and reassigned to Rhode Island, before retiring from military service in 1863. In 1865, he returned to Fort Sumter to again raise the American flag that he had lowered during the 1861 surrender.

==Early life and career==
Anderson was born at &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Retreat,&quot; the Anderson family estate near Louisville, Kentucky. His father, Richard Clough Anderson Sr. (1750–1826), served in the Continental Army as an aide-de-camp to the Marquis de Lafayette during the American Revolutionary War, and was a charter member of the Society of the Cincinnati; his mother, Sarah Marshall (1779–1854), was a cousin of John Marshall, the fourth Chief Justice of the United States. He graduated from the United States Military Academy (West Point) in 1825, and received a commission as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Regiment of Artillery.

A few months after graduation, he became a private secretary to his older brother Richard Clough Anderson, Jr., who was serving as the US Minister to Gran Colombia. He served in the Black Hawk War of 1832 as a colonel of Illinois volunteers, where he had the distinction of twice mustering Abraham Lincoln in and once out of army service. He also was in charge of transporting Black Hawk to Jefferson Barracks after his capture, assisted by Jefferson Davis.

Returning to regular Army service as a first lieutenant in 1833, he served in the Second Seminole War as an assistant adjutant general on the staff of Winfield Scott, and was promoted to captain in October 1841.

In the Mexican–American War, he participated in the Siege of Veracruz, March 9–29, 1847, the Battle of Cerro Gordo, April 17–18, 1847, the Skirmish of Amazoque, May 14, 1847, and Battle of Molino del Rey on September 8, 1847. He was severely wounded at Molino del Rey while assaulting enemy fortifications, for which he received a brevet promotion to major.

Due to his wounds, Anderson was on sick leave of absence during 1847–48. He was then in garrison at Fort Preble, Maine from 1848 to 1849. He then served from 1849 to 1851 as a member of the Board of Officers to devise &quot;A Complete System of Instruction for Siege, Garrison, Seacoast, and Mountain Artillery,&quot; which was adopted on May 10, 1851. He then returned to garrison duty at Fort Preble from 1850 to 1853.

From 1855 to 1859, in view of his precarious health and probably also due to his connections to General Winfield Scott, Anderson was assigned to the light duty of inspecting the iron beams produced in a mill in Trenton, New Jersey for Federal construction projects. (While residing in Trenton, Anderson became a Freemason and was a member of Mercer Lodge No. 50.) He eventually received a permanent promotion to major of the 1st Regiment of Artillery in the Regular Army on October 5, 1857. He was the author of &quot;Instruction for Field Artillery, Horse and Foot&quot; in 1839.

==Civil War==
===Fort Sumter===

In November 1860, Anderson was assigned to command of U.S. forces in and around Charleston, South Carolina. When South Carolina seceded in December 1860, Anderson remained loyal to the Union although he was a native of Kentucky and a former slaveowner. He moved his small garrison from Fort Moultrie, which was indefensible, to the more modern and more defensible Fort Sumter, in the middle of Charleston Harbor. In February 1861, the Confederate States of America was formed and took charge. Confederate President Jefferson Davis ordered for the fort be captured. The artillery attack was commanded by Brigadier General P. G. T. Beauregard, who had been Anderson&#x27;s student at West Point. The attack began April 12, 1861, and continued until Anderson, badly outnumbered and outgunned, surrendered the fort on April 13. The battle began the American Civil War. No one was killed in the battle on either side, but one Union soldier was killed and another was mortally wounded during a 50-gun salute to the flag just before the fort was surrendered.

===Status as national hero===
Anderson&#x27;s actions in defense of Fort Sumter made him an immediate national hero. He was promoted to brigadier general in the Regular Army, effective May 15. Anderson took the fort&#x27;s 33-star flag with him to New York City, where he participated in a Union Square patriotic rally that was the largest public gathering in North America until then.

===Symbolism of the American flag===
The modern meaning of the American flag, according to Harold Holzer in 2007 and Adam Goodheart in 2011, was forged by Anderson&#x27;s stand at Fort Sumter. Holzer states that New York City:

During the war, the flag was used throughout the North to symbolize American nationalism and the rejection of secessionism. Goodheart explained that the flag was transformed into a sacred symbol of patriotism:
Before that day, the flag had served mostly as a military ensign or a convenient marking of American territory ... and displayed on special occasions like the Fourth of July. But in the weeks after Major Anderson&#x27;s surprising stand, it became something different. Suddenly the Stars and Stripes flew ... from houses, from storefronts, from churches; above the village greens and college quads. ... [T]hat old flag meant something new. The abstraction of the Union cause was transfigured into a physical thing: strips of cloth that millions of people would fight for, and many thousands die for.

===Assignments===
Anderson then went on a highly successful recruiting tour of the North and was promoted to brigadier general as of May 15, 1861. His next assignment placed him in another sensitive political position as commander of the Department of Kentucky (subsequently renamed the Department of the Cumberland), in a border state that had officially declared neutrality between the warring parties. He started to serve in that position from May 28, 1861. Historians commonly attribute failing health as the reason for his relinquishment of command to Brigadier General William T. Sherman, on October 7, 1861, but a letter from Joshua Fry Speed, Lincoln&#x27;s close friend, suggests that Lincoln preferred Anderson&#x27;s removal.

Speed met with Anderson and found him reluctant to implement Lincoln&#x27;s wishes to distribute rifles to Unionists in Kentucky. Anderson, Speed wrote to Lincoln on October 8, &quot;seemed grieved that [he] had to surrender his command ... [but] agreed that it was necessary and gracefully yielded.&quot;

In 1862, Anderson was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati in which his grandnephew, Ambassador Larz Anderson, was highly active.

Anderson&#x27;s last military assignment was a brief period as commanding officer of Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1863. Anderson officially retired from the Army on October 27, 1863 &quot;for Disability resulting from Long and Faithful Service, and Wounds and disease contracted in the Line of Duty,&quot; but he continued to serve on the staff of the general commanding the Eastern Department, headquartered in New York City, from October 27, 1863, to January 22, 1869. On February 3, 1865, Anderson was brevetted a major general for &quot;gallantry and meritorious service&quot; in the defense of Fort Sumter.

==Later life==

After Robert E. Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox and the effective conclusion of the war, at the behest of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Anderson returned to Charleston in uniform. Four years after lowering the 33-star flag in surrender, Anderson raised it in triumph over the recaptured but badly battered Fort Sumter. However, hours after the ceremony of April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln.
After the war, Anderson became a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. In 1869, he discussed the future of the U.S. Army with Sylvanus Thayer. Afterward, they helped establish the Military Academy&#x27;s Association of Graduates (AoG).

In 1869 Anderson was reported to have sold his library and moved to Europe, &quot;as half pay would not support his family here&quot;. Someone questioning his need informed us that Anderson&#x27;s half salary as brigadier general was $4,125 ().

Anderson died in Nice, France in 1871, seeking a cure for his ailments. He was interred at West Point Cemetery.

==Family==

Anderson&#x27;s brother, Charles Anderson, served as Governor of Ohio from 1865 to 1866. A second brother, Larz Anderson II was the father of Nicholas Longworth Anderson who served as a general in the Union Army. Nicholas&#x27; son, Larz Anderson III, was a diplomat and a leading member of the Society of the Cincinnati.

Another brother, William Marshall Anderson, was a Western explorer and Ohio attorney. A zealous Catholic and Confederate sympathizer, he briefly moved to Mexico during the reign of Emperor Maximilian in hopes of establishing a Confederate colony there. W. Marshall Anderson&#x27;s son, Thomas M. Anderson, was a brigadier general who fought in the Spanish–American War and Philippine–American War.

In 1845, Anderson married Eliza Bayard Clinch (1828–1905), the daughter of Duncan Lamont Clinch. They were the parents of five children: Marie (1849–1925), Sophie (1852–1934), Eliza, Robert Jr. (1859–1879) and Duncan. Anderson was the great-grandfather of actor Montgomery Clift through his daughter Maria, although this relationship has not been definitively established by genealogical sources. Allegedly, the doctor who delivered Ethel Anderson Clift told her when she was an adult that she was the illegitimate daughter of Maria Anderson and Woodbury Blair, but no documentation exists to verify the relationship. Nonetheless, the legend continues. Virtually all sources that advance this theory reference Ethel&#x27;s own statements or Clift&#x27;s biographies.

<text>Martha M. Place (September 18, 1849 – March 20, 1899) was an American murderer and the first woman to die in the electric chair. She was executed on March 20, 1899, at Sing Sing Correctional Facility for the murder of her stepdaughter Ida Place.

==Background==
Martha Place was born Martha &quot;Mattie&quot; Garretson on September 18, 1849, in Readington Township, New Jersey, to Ellen (née Wyckoff) and Isaac V. N. Garretson. Place was struck in the head by a sleigh at age 23; her brother claimed that she never completely recovered and that the accident left her mentally unstable. Before relocating to New York, Place lived in New Jersey, working as a dressmaker. She married a man named Wesley Savacool and had a son, Ross Savacool. Wesley left the relationship when Ross was three and, finding herself in hardship, Martha gave Ross up for adoption to the Ashenbach family of Newark, who had recently lost a son. They renamed him William.

In 1893 Martha went to work as a housekeeper for a man named William W. Place, at 598 Hancock Street in Brooklyn, whom she would marry later that year.

Place had a daughter named Ida from a previous marriage. William married Martha to help him raise his daughter, although it was later rumored that Martha was jealous of Ida. William called the police at least once after his wife threatened to kill Ida.

===Murder===
On the evening of February 7, 1898, William Place arrived at his Brooklyn, New York, home and was attacked by Martha, who was wielding an axe. William escaped and ran for help. When the police arrived, they found Martha Place in critical condition. She was lying on the floor with clothes over her head and gas from burners was escaping into the room. Upstairs they discovered the body of 17-year-old Ida Place lying on a bed, blood coming from her mouth. William was an amateur photographer, which involved the use of acid, and the murderer had thrown this acid in Ida&#x27;s eyes. The evidence later indicated Ida Place died from asphyxiation. Martha Place was hospitalized and arrested.

===Trial===
Place proclaimed her innocence while awaiting trial. One contemporary newspaper report described the defendant in this way:

Martha Place was found guilty of the murder of her stepdaughter Ida and sentenced to death. Her husband was a key witness against her.

===Execution===
The governor of the state of New York, Theodore Roosevelt, was asked to commute Place&#x27;s death sentence, but he refused. Having never executed a woman in the electric chair, those responsible for carrying out the death warrant devised a new way to place the electrodes upon her, deciding to slit her dress and place the electrode on her ankle. Edwin F. Davis was the executioner. According to the reports of witnesses, she died instantly.

Martha Place was buried in the family cemetery plot in East Millstone, New Jersey, without religious observances.

Although Place was the first woman to die in the electric chair, she was the third to be sentenced to die by this method, the first two being serial killer Lizzie Halliday (1894 conviction commuted and sent to an asylum) and Maria Barbella (sentenced in 1895 and acquitted the next year).

<text>Litchfield is a town in and former county seat of Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 8,192 at the 2020 census. The town is part of the Northwest Hills Planning Region. The boroughs of Bantam and Litchfield are located within the town. There are also three unincorporated villages: East Litchfield, Milton, and Northfield. Northfield, located in the southeastern corner of Litchfield, is home to a high percentage of the Litchfield population.

==History==
Originally called Bantam township, Litchfield incorporated in 1719. The town derives its name from Lichfield, in England.

In 1751 it became the county seat of Litchfield County, and at the same time the borough of Litchfield (incorporated in 1879) was laid out. From 1776 to 1780, two depots for military stores and a workshop for the Continental army were maintained, and the leaden statue of George III., erected in Bowling Green (New York City), in 1770, and torn down by citizens on July 9, 1776, was cut up and taken to Litchfield, where, in the house of Oliver Wolcott, it was melted into bullets for the American army by Wolcott&#x27;s daughter and sister.

During the American Revolution, several prominent Loyalists were held prisoner in the town, including William Franklin, son of Benjamin Franklin, and David Mathews, Mayor of New York City.

In 1784, the first law school in the United States, the so-named Litchfield Law School, was established by judge and legal scholar Tapping Reeve. Prior to its establishment, Reeve had accepted several legal apprentices since he had settled there in 1773, but saw such demand for his expertise that he formally opened the one-room school within a decade. During the school&#x27;s fifty-year history it would accept more than 1,100 students, including Aaron Burr, Jr., Horace Mann, and Levi Woodbury, the first justice of the US Supreme Court to attend law school.

Litchfield was also home to a pioneering institution of young women&#x27;s education, the Litchfield Female Academy, founded in 1792 by Sarah Pierce.

Litchfield has a very rich history. The Litchfield Historical Society, located in the center of town, contains a wide variety of items with historical importance to the town.

<text>L’Age d’Or was a German independent music label based in Hamburg, which has played an important role in creating the Hamburger Schule and was the parent label of Ladomat 2000.

The label was founded in 1988 by Carol von Rautenkranz and Kolossale Jugend guitarist Pascal Fuhlbrügge, who together had already been organizing concerts in the post-NDW music scene of Hamburg for some time. They were joined by Thorsten &quot;Taucher&quot; Weßel from the band Ostzonensuppenwürfelmachenkrebs, who later became a co-owner. Fuhlbrügge left the label in 1993. In 1994 Ladomat 2000 was launched by Charlotte Goltermann as a sublabel to also release electronic music. Both labels went out of business in 2007.

The releases on L&#x27;Age D&#x27;Or were formative for the Hamburger Schule. Ladomat 2000 reflected this scene&#x27;s growing interest in rave, techno and house music. Tocotronic, Die Sterne and the house music project Whirlpool Productions reached some commercial success in the mid-nineties.

<doc id="380097" wikidata="Q189458" url="?curid=380097" title="Academic art">
<text>Academic art, academicism, or academism, is a style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies of art. This method extended its influence throughout the Western world over several centuries, from its origins in Italy in the mid-16th century, until its dissipation in the early 20th century. It reached its apogee in the 19th century, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. In this period, the standards of the French were very influential, combining elements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, with Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres a key figure in the formation of the style in painting. The success of the French model led to the founding of countless other art academies in several countries. Later painters who tried to continue the synthesis included William-Adolphe Bouguereau, Thomas Couture, and Hans Makart among many others. In sculpture, academic art is characterized by a tendency towards monumentality, as in the works of Auguste Bartholdi and Daniel Chester French.

The academies were established to replace medieval artists&#x27; guilds and aimed to systematize the teaching of art. They emphasized the emulation of established masters and the classical tradition, downplaying the importance of individual creativity, valuing instead collective, aesthetic and ethical concepts. By helping raise the professional status of artists, the academies distanced them from artisans and brought them closer to intellectuals. They also played a crucial role in organizing the art world, controlling cultural ideology, taste, criticism, the art market, as well as the exhibition and dissemination of art. They wielded significant influence due to their association with state power, often acting as conduits for the dissemination of artistic, political, and social ideals, by deciding what was considered &quot;official art&quot;. As a result, they faced criticism and controversy from artists and others on the margins of these academic circles, and their restrictive and universalist regulations are sometimes considered a reflection of absolutism.

Overall, academicism has had a significant impact on the development of art education and artistic styles. Its artists rarely showed interest in depicting the everyday or profane. Thus, academic art is predominantly idealistic rather than realistic, aiming to create highly polished works through the mastery of color and form. Although smaller works such as portraits, landscapes and still-lifes were also produced, the movement and the contemporary public and critics most valued large history paintings showing moments from narratives that were very often taken from ancient or exotic areas of history and mythology, though less often the traditional religious narratives. Orientalist art was a major branch, with many specialist painters, as were scenes from classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. Academic art is also closely related to Beaux-Arts architecture, as well as classical music and dance, which developed simultaneously and hold to a similar classicizing ideal.

Although production of academic art continued into the 20th century, the style had become vacuous, and was strongly rejected by the artists of set of new art movements, of which Realism and Impressionism were some of the first. In this context, the style is often called &quot;eclecticism&quot;, &quot;art pompier&quot; (pejoratively), and sometimes linked with &quot;historicism&quot; and &quot;syncretism&quot;. By World War I, it had fallen from favor almost completely with critics and buyers, before regaining some appreciation since the end of the 20th century.

==Origins and theoretical foundations==

===The first art academies in Renaissance Italy===
The first academy of art was founded in Florence by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici, on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the architect Giorgio Vasari, who called it the Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno (Academy and Company for the Arts of Drawing) as it was divided in two different operative branches. While the company was a kind of corporation that every working artist in Tuscany could join, the academy comprised only the most eminent artists of Cosimo&#x27;s court, and had the task of overseeing all Florentine artistic activities, including teaching, and safeguarding local cultural traditions. Among the founding members were Michelangelo, Bartolomeo Ammannati, Agnolo Bronzino and Francesco da Sangallo. In this institution, students learned the &quot;arti del disegno&quot; (a term coined by Vasari) and heard lectures on anatomy and geometry. The Accademia&#x27;s fame spread quickly, to the point that, within just five months of its founding, important Venetian artists such as Titian, Salviati, Tintoretto and Palladio applied for admission, and in 1567, King Philip II of Spain consulted it about plans for El Escorial.

Another academy, the Accademia de i Pittori e Scultori di Roma (Academy of Painters and Sculptors of Rome), better known as the Accademia di San Luca (named after the patron saint of painters, St. Luke), was founded about a decade later in Rome. It served an educational function and was more concerned with art theory than the Florentine one, attaching great importance to attending theoretical lectures, debates and drawing classes. Twelve academics were immediately appointed as teachers, establishing a series of disciplinary measures for studies and instituting a system of awards for the most capable students.

In 1582, the painter and art instructor Annibale Carracci opened his very influential Accademia dei Desiderosi (Academy of the Desirous) in Bologna without official support; in some ways, this was more like a traditional artist&#x27;s studio, but that he felt the need to label it as an &quot;academy&quot; demonstrates the attraction of the idea at the time.

The emergence of art academies in the 16th century was due to the need to respond to new social demands. Several states, which were moving towards absolutism, realized that it was necessary to create an art that specifically identified them and served as a symbol of civic unity, and was also capable of symbolically consolidating the status of their rulers. In this process, the Catholic Church, then the greatest political force and social unifier in Europe, began to lose some of its influence as a result of the greater secularization of societies. Sacred art, by far the largest field of artistic expression throughout the Middle Ages, came to coexist with an expanding profane art, derived from classical sources, which had been experiencing a slow revival since the 12th century, and which, by the time of the Renaissance, had been established as the most prestigious cultural reference and model of quality.

This re-emergence of classicism required artists to become more cultured, in order to competently transpose this reference to the visual arts. At the same time, the old system of artistic production, organized by guilds—class associations of an artisanal nature, linked more to mechanical crafts than to intellectual erudition—began to be seen as outdated and socially unworthy, as artists began to desire equality with the intellectual versed in the liberal arts, since art itself began to be seen not only as a technical task, as it had been for centuries, but mainly as a way of acquiring and transmitting knowledge. In this new context, painting and sculpture began to be seen as theorizable, just as other arts such as literature and especially poetry were already. However, if on the one hand the artists did rise socially, on the other they lost the security of market insertion that the guild system provided, having to live in the uncertain expectation of individual protection by some patron.

===Standardization: French academicism and visual arts===
If Italy was to be credited with founding this new type of institution, France was responsible for taking the model to a first stage of great order and stability. The country&#x27;s first attempts to establish academies like the Italian ones also took place in the 16th century, during the reign of King Henry III, especially through the work of the poet Jean-Antoine de Baïf, who founded an academy linked to the French Crown. Like its Italian counterparts, it was primarily philological-philosophical in nature, but it also worked on concepts relating to the arts and sciences. Although it developed intense activity with regular debates and theoretical production, defending classical principles, it lacked an educational structure and had a brief existence.

The Accademia di San Luca later served as the model for the French Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture), founded in 1648 by a group of artists led by Charles Le Brun, and which later became the (Academy of Fine Arts). Its objective was similar to the Italian one, to honor artists &quot;who were gentlemen practicing a liberal art&quot; from craftsmen, who were engaged in manual labor. This emphasis on the intellectual component of artmaking had a considerable impact on the subjects and styles of academic art.

After an ineffective start, the Académie royale was reorganized in 1661 by King Louis XIV, whose aim was to control all the country&#x27;s artistic activity, and in 1671, it came under the control of First Minister of State Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who confirmed Le Brun as director. Together, they made it the main executive arm of a program to glorify the king&#x27;s absolutist monarchy, definitively establishing the school&#x27;s association with the State and thereby vesting it with enormous directive power over the entire national art system, which contributed to making France the new European cultural center, displacing the hitherto Italian supremacy. But while for the Italian Renaissance, art was also a survey of the natural world, for Le Brun it was above all the product of an acquired culture, inherited forms and an established tradition.

During this period, academic doctrine reached the peak of its rigor, comprehensiveness, uniformity, formalism and explicitness, and according to art historian Moshe Barasch, at no other time in the history of art theory has the idea of perfection been more intensely cultivated as the artist&#x27;s highest goal, with the production of the Italian High Renaissance as the ultimate model. Thus, Italy continued to be an invaluable reference, so much so that a branch was established in Rome in 1666, the French Academy, with Charles Errard as its first director.

At the same time, a controversy occurred among the members of the Académie, which would come to dominate artistic attitudes for the rest of the century. This &quot;battle of styles&quot; was a conflict over whether Peter Paul Rubens or Nicolas Poussin was a suitable model to follow. Followers of Poussin, called &quot;poussinistes&quot;, argued that line (disegno) should dominate art, because of its appeal to the intellect, while followers of Rubens, called &quot;rubenistes&quot;, argued that color (colore) should be the dominant feature, because of its appeal to emotion. The debate was revived in the early 19th century, under the movements of Neoclassicism typified by the art of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and Romanticism typified by the artwork of Eugène Delacroix. Debates also occurred over whether it was better to learn art by looking at nature, or at the artistic masters of the past.

===Transformations and diffusion of the French model===
At the end of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign, the academic style and teachings strongly associated with his monarchy began to spread throughout Europe, accompanying the growth of the urban nobility. A series of other important academies were formed across the continent, inspired by the success of the French Académie: the Akademie der Bildenden Künste in Nuremberg (1662), the Akademie der Künste in Berlin (1696), the Akademie der bildenden Künste in Vienna (1698), the Royal Drawing Academy in Stockholm (1735), the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid (1752), the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg (1757), and the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan (1776), to name a few. In England, this was the Royal Academy of Arts, which was founded in 1768 with a mission &quot;to establish a school or academy of design for the use of students in the arts&quot;.

The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, founded in 1754, may be taken as a successful example in a smaller country, which achieved its aim of producing a national school and reducing the reliance on imported artists. The painters of the Danish Golden Age of roughly 1800–1850 were nearly all trained there, and drawing on Italian and Dutch Golden Age paintings as examples, many returned to teach locally. The history of Danish art is much less marked by tension between academic art and other styles than is the case in other countries.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the model expanded to America, with the Academy of San Carlos in Mexico being founded in 1783, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in the United States in 1805, and the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts in Brazil in 1826. Meanwhile, back in Italy, another major center of irradiation appeared, Venice, launching the tradition of urban views and &quot;capriccios&quot;, fantasy landscape scenes populated by ancient ruins, which became favorites of noble travelers on the Grand Tour.

==Development of the academic style==

===Early challenges: the Enlightenment and Romanticism===
Even with its wide spread, the academic system began to be seriously challenged through the actions of intellectuals linked to the Enlightenment. For them, academicism had become an outdated model, excessively rigid and dogmatic; they criticized the methodology, which they believed produced an art that was merely servile to ancient examples, and condemned the institutional administration, which they considered corrupt and despotic. However, an important Enlightenment figure like Diderot subscribed to much of the academic ideal, supported the hierarchy of genres (&quot;see below&quot;), and said that &quot;the imagination creates nothing&quot;. At the end of the 18th century, following the turmoil of the French Revolution, a real campaign was mounted against the teaching of the Academy, which was identified as a symbol of the Ancien Régime. In 1793, the painter Jacques-Louis David, closely linked to the revolutionaries, took over the direction of the artistic affairs of the new republic and, after complying with the request of numerous artists dissatisfied with the institution&#x27;s bureaucracy and system of privileges, dissolved the Parisian academies and all the other royal academies in the countryside. However, the extinction of the old schools was temporary, as a Committee for the Arts was subsequently organized, which led to the founding in 1795 of a new institution, the Institut de France, which included an artistic section and was responsible for reorganizing the national arts system.

The challenges to academicism in France, however, were more nominal than real. Art courses returned to operating in broadly the same way as before, the hierarchy of genres was resurrected, the awards and salons were maintained, the branch in Rome remained active, and the State continued to be the biggest sponsor of art. Quatremère de Quincy, the secretary of the new Institut, which had been born as an apparatus of revolutionary renewal, paradoxically believed that art schools served to preserve traditions, not to found new ones. The greatest innovations he introduced were the idea of reunifying the arts under an atmosphere of egalitarianism, eliminating honorary titles for members and some other privileges, and his attempt to make administration more transparent, eminently public and functional. In reinterpreting the Platonic theory that the arts are questionable because they are imperfect imitations of an abstract ideal reality, he considered this idea only in a moral sphere, politicized and republicanized it, relating the truth of the arts to that of social institutions. He also claimed that the political reality of the republic was a reflection of the republic of the arts that he sought to establish. But beyond the ideas, in practice, authoritarianism, which was one of the reasons given for the extinction of the royal academies, continued to be practiced in the republican administration.

Another attack on the academic model came from the early Romantics, at the turn of 18th to 19th centuries, who preached a practice centered on individual originality and independence. Around 1816, the painter Théodore Géricault, one of the exponents of French Romanticism, stated:
===Stylistic trends and contradictions===
Since the onset of the Poussiniste-Rubeniste debate, many artists worked between the two styles. In the 19th century, in the revived form of the debate, the attention and the aims of the art world became to synthesize the line of Neoclassicism with the color of Romanticism. One artist after another was claimed by critics to have achieved the synthesis, among them Théodore Chassériau, Ary Scheffer, Francesco Hayez, Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, and Thomas Couture. William-Adolphe Bouguereau, a later academic artist, commented that the trick to being a good painter is seeing &quot;color and line as the same thing&quot;. Thomas Couture promoted the same idea in a book he authored on art method—arguing that whenever one said a painting had better color or better line it was nonsense, because whenever color appeared brilliant it depended on line to convey it, and vice versa; and that color was really a way to talk about the &quot;value&quot; of form.

====Historicism====
Another development during this period, called historicism, included adopting historic styles or imitating the work of historic artists and artisans in order to show the era in history that the painting depicted. In the history of art, after Neoclassicism which in the Romantic era could itself be considered a historicist movement, the 19th century included a new historicist phase characterized by an interpretation not only of Greek and Roman classicism, but also of succeeding stylistic eras, which were increasingly respected. This is best seen in the work of Baron Jan August Hendrik Leys, a later influence on James Tissot. It is also seen in the development of the Neo-Grec style. Historicism is also meant to refer to the belief and practice associated with academic art that one should incorporate and conciliate the innovations of different traditions of art from the past.

====Allegory in art====
The art world also grew to give increasing focus on allegory in art. Theories of the importance of both line and color asserted that through these elements an artist exerts control over the medium to create psychological effects, in which themes, emotions, and ideas can be represented. As artists attempted to synthesize these theories in practice, the attention on the artwork as an allegorical or figurative vehicle was emphasized. It was held that the representations in painting and sculpture should evoke Platonic forms, or ideals, where behind ordinary depictions one would glimpse something abstract, some eternal truth. Hence, Keats&#x27; famous musing &quot;Beauty is truth, truth beauty&quot;. The paintings were desired to be an &quot;idée&quot;, a full and complete idea. Bouguereau is known to have said that he would not paint &quot;a war&quot;, but would paint &quot;War&quot;. Many paintings by academic artists are simple nature allegories with titles like &quot;Dawn&quot;, &quot;Dusk&quot;, &quot;Seeing&quot;, and &quot;Tasting&quot;, where these ideas are personified by a single nude figure, composed in such a way as to bring out the essence of the idea.

====Idealism====
Stylistically, academic art cultivated the ideal of perfection and at the same time selective imitation of reality (mimesis), which had existed since Aristotle. With perfect mastery of color, light and shadow, forms were created in a quasi-photorealistic manner. Some paintings have a &quot;polished finish&quot; where no brushstroke can be recognized on the finished work. After the oil sketch, the artist would produce the final painting with the academic &quot;fini&quot;, changing the painting to meet stylistic standards and attempting to idealize the images and add perfect detail. Similarly, perspective was constructed geometrically on a flat surface and was not really the product of sight.

The trend in art was also towards greater idealism, which is contrary to realism, in that the figures depicted were made simpler and more abstract—idealized—in order to be able to represent the ideals they stood in for. This would involve both generalizing forms seen in nature, and subordinating them to the unity and theme of the artwork.

====Hierarchy of genres====
The representation of the various emotions was codified in detail by academicism and the artistic genres themselves were subjected to a scale of prestige. Because history and mythology were considered plays or dialectics of ideas, a fertile ground for important allegory, using themes from these subjects was regarded as the most serious form of painting. This hierarchy of genres, originally created in the 17th century, was highly valued, where history painting (also known as the &quot;grande genre&quot;)—classical, religious, mythological, literary, and allegorical subjects—was placed at the top, followed by &quot;minor genres&quot;—portraiture, genre painting, landscapes, and still-lifes. 

The historical genre, the most appreciated, included works that conveyed themes of an inspirational and ennobling nature, essentially with an ethical background, consistent with the tradition founded by masters such as Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci. Paul Delaroche is a typifying example of French history painting and Benjamin West of the British-American vogue for painting scenes from recent history. Paintings by Hans Makart are often larger than life historical dramas, and he combined this with a historicism in decoration to dominate the style of 19th-century Vienna culture. Portraits included large-format depictions of people, suitable for their public glorification, but also smaller pieces for private use. Everyday scenes, also known as genre scenes, portrayed common life in a symbolic manner, landscapes offered perspectives of idealized virgin nature or city panoramas, and still-lifes consisted of groupings of diverse objects in formal compositions.

The justification for this hierarchization lay in the idea that each genre had an inherent and specific moral force. Thus, an artist could convey a moral principle with much more power and ease through a historical scene than, for example, through a still-life. Furthermore, following Greek concepts, it was believed that the highest form of art was the ideal representation of the human body, hence landscapes and still-lifes, in which man did not appear, had little prestige. Finally, with a primarily social and didactic function, academic art favored large works and large-format portraits, more suitable for viewing by large groups of spectators and better suited to decorating public spaces.

All of these trends were influenced by the theories of the German philosopher Hegel, who held that history was a dialectic of competing ideas, which eventually resolved in synthesis.

===Maturation: an increasingly bourgeois art form===
Napoleon was the &quot;swan song&quot; of the concept of art as a vehicle of moral values and a mirror of virtue. He actively patronized and employed artists to portray his personal glory, that of his Empire and of his political and military conquests. After him, the fragmentation and weakening of ideals began to become visible and irreversible. With the cooling of the libertarian ardor of the first Romantics, with the final failure of Napoleon&#x27;s imperialist project, and with the popularization of an eclectic style that blended Romanticism and Neoclassicism, adapting them to the purposes of the bourgeoisie, which became one of the greatest sponsors of the arts, the emergence of a general feeling of resignation appeared, as well as a growing prevalence of individual bourgeois taste against idealistic collective systems. Soon the preferences of this social class, now so influential, penetrated higher education and became worthy objects of representation, changing the hierarchy of genres and proliferating portraits and all the so-called minor genres, such as everyday scenes and still-lifes, which became more pronounced as the century progressed.

The bourgeoisie&#x27;s support for academies was a way of demonstrating education and acquiring social prestige, bringing them closer to the cultural and political elites. Finally, Neo-Gothic revivalism, the development of a taste for the picturesque as an autonomous aesthetic criterion, the revival of Hellenistic eclecticism, the progress of medievalist, orientalist and folkloric studies, the growing participation of women in art production, the valorisation of handicrafts and applied arts, opened up other fronts of appreciation for the visual arts, finding other truths worthy of appreciation that had previously been neglected and relegated to the margins of official culture. As a result of this great cultural transformation, the academic educational model, in order to survive, had to incorporate some of these innovations, but it broadly maintained the established tradition, and managed to become even more influential, continuing to inspire not only Europe, but also America and other countries colonized by Europeans, throughout the 19th century.

Another factor in this academic revival, even in the face of a profoundly changing scenario, was the reiteration of the idea of art as an instrument of political affirmation by nationalist movements in several countries.

===Apotheosis: Parisian salons and further influence===
The 19th century was the heyday of the academies, in the sense that their output became extremely well accepted among a much wider—but often less cultured and less demanding—public, giving academic art a popularity as great as that enjoyed today by cinema, and with an equally popular theme, covering everything from traditional historical subjects to comic vignettes, from sweet and sentimental portraits to medievalist or picturesque scenes from exotic Eastern countries, something unthinkable during the Ancien Régime.

By the second half of the 19th century, academic art had saturated European society. Exhibitions were held often, with the most popular exhibition being the Paris Salon, and beginning in 1903, the Salon d&#x27;Automne. These salons were large scale events that attracted crowds of visitors, both native and foreign. As much a social affair as an artistic one, 50,000 people might visit on a single Sunday, and as many as 500,000 could see the exhibition during its two-month run. Thousands of paintings were displayed, hung from just below eye level all the way up to the ceiling in a manner now known as &quot;Salon style&quot;. A successful showing at the salon was a seal of approval for an artist, making his work saleable to the growing ranks of private collectors. Bouguereau, Alexandre Cabanel and Jean-Léon Gérôme were leading figures of this art world.

During the reign of academic art, the paintings of the Rococo era, previously held in low favor, were revived to popularity, and themes often used in Rococo art such as Eros and Psyche were popular again. The academic art world also admired Raphael, for the idealism of his work, in fact preferring him over Michelangelo.

====England====
In England, the influence of the Royal Academy grew as its association with the State consolidated. In the first half of the 19th century, the Royal Academy already exercised direct or indirect control over a vast network of galleries, museums, exhibitions and other artistic societies, and over a complex of administrative agencies that included the Crown, parliament and other state departments, which found their cultural expression through their relations with the academic institution. The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition gained momentum at the time and has been staged annually without interruption to the present day.

As the century progressed, challenges to this primacy began to emerge, demanding that its relations with the government be clarified, and the institution began to pay more attention to market aspects in a society that was becoming more heterogeneous and cultivating multiple aesthetic tendencies. Subsidiary schools were also opened in various cities to meet regional demands. By the middle of the 19th century, the Royal Academy had already lost control over British artistic production, faced with the multiplication of independent creators and associations, but continued, facing internal tensions, to try to preserve it. Around 1860, it was again stabilized through new strategies of monopolizing power, incorporating new trends into its orbit, such as promoting the previously ignored technique of watercolor, which had become vastly popular, accepting the admission of women, requiring new members in an enlarged membership to renounce their affiliation to other societies and reforming its administrative structure to appear as a private institution, but imbued with a civic purpose and a public character. In this way, it managed to administer a significant part of the British artistic universe throughout the 19th century, and despite the opposition of societies and groups of artists such as the Pre-Raphaelites, it managed to remain a disciplinary, educational and consecrating agency of the greatest importance, able to largely accompany the progress of modernism, contradicting a common view that academies are invariably reactionary.

====Germany====
In Germany, the academic spirit initially encountered some resistance to its full implementation. Already at the end of the 18th century, theorists such as Baumgarten, Schiller and Kant had promoted the autonomy of Aesthetics through the concept of &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;, and had emphasized the importance of the artist&#x27;s self-education, against the massification imposed by civilization and its institutions, seeing the collectivizing structure and impersonal nature of academia as a threat to their desires for creative freedom, individualistic inspiration, and absolute originality. In this vein, art criticism began to take on distinctly sociological colors.

Part of this reaction was due to the activity of the Nazarenes, a group of painters who sought a return to a Renaissance style and medieval practices in a spirit of austerity and fraternity. Under their influence, masterclasses were introduced—paradoxically within the academies themselves—which sought to group promising students around a master, who was responsible for their instruction, but with much more concentrated attention and care than in the more generalist French system, based on the assumption that such more individualized treatment could provide a stronger and deeper education. This method was first instituted at the Dusseldorf Academy and progressed slowly, but over the course of the 19th century, it became common to all German academies, and was also imitated in other northern European countries. Interesting results of the masterclasses were the beginning of a tradition of large-scale mural painting and the steering of the local avant-garde along less iconoclastic lines than the Parisian ones.

====United States====
The influence of the Royal Academy extended across the ocean and strongly determined the foundation and direction of American art from the end of the 18th century until the middle of the 19th century, when the country began to establish its cultural independence. Some of the leading local artists studied in London under the guidance of the Royal Academy and others, who settled in England, continued to exert influence in their home country through regular submissions of works of art. This was the case with John Singleton Copley, the dominant influence in his country until the beginning of the 19th century, and also with Benjamin West, who became one of the leaders of the English neoclassical-romantic movement and one of the main European names of his generation in the field of history painting. He made a number of fellow disciples, such as Charles Willson Peale, Gilbert Stuart and John Trumbull, and his influence was similar to that of Copley on American painting.

The first academy to be created in the United States was the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, founded in 1805 and still active today. The initiative came from the painter Charles Peale and the sculptor William Rush, along with other artists and traders. Its progress was slow, and its peak was only reached at the end of the 19th century, when it began to receive significant financial support, opened a gallery and formed its own collection, becoming an anti-modernist bastion. The most decisive step toward the formation of an American academic culture was taken when the National Academy of Design was founded in 1826 by Samuel F. B. Morse, Asher B. Durand, Thomas Cole, and other artists dissatisfied with the orientation of the Pennsylvania Academy. It soon became the most respected artistic institution in the country. Its method followed the traditional academic model, focusing on drawing from classical and live models, in addition to offering lectures on anatomy, perspective, history and mythology, among other subjects. Cole and Durand were also the founders of the Hudson River School, an aesthetic movement that began a great painting tradition, lasting for three generations, with a remarkable unity of principles, and which presented the national landscape in an epic, idealistic and sometimes fanciful light. Its members included Albert Bierstadt and Frederic Edwin Church, the most celebrated landscape painters of their generation.

In the field of sculpture, however, the greatest influence came from the Italian academies, especially through the example of Antonio Canova, who was the main figure of European neoclassicism, educated in part at the Venice Academy and in Rome. Italy offered a historical and cultural backdrop of irresistible interest to sculptors, with priceless monuments, ruins and collections, and working conditions were infinitely superior to those of the New World, where there was a shortage of both marble and capable assistants to help the artist in the complex and laborious art of stone carving and bronze casting. Horatio Greenough was just the first in a large wave of Americans to settle between Rome and Florence. The most notable of these was William Wetmore Story, who after 1857 assumed leadership of the American colony that had been created in Rome, becoming a reference for all newcomers. Despite their stay in Italy, the group continued to be celebrated in their country, and their artistic achievements received continuous press coverage until the neoclassical vogue dissipated in North America from the 1870s onwards. By this time, the United States had already established its culture and created the general conditions to promote consistent and high-level local sculptural production, adopting an eclectic synthesis of styles. These sculptors also strongly absorbed the influence of the French Académie, several of them were educated there, and their production populated most public spaces and the facades of major American buildings, with works of strong civic and great formalism that became icons of local culture, such as the statue of Abraham Lincoln by Daniel Chester French and the memorial to Robert Gould Shaw by Augustus Saint-Gaudens.

In 1875, the Art Students League took over as the leading American art academy, founded by students inspired by the model of the French Académie, establishing the guidelines for national art education until World War II, while also opening its classes to women. Offering better working conditions than its Parisian model, the League was created by artists who saw in the French academic environment an appeal to culture and civilization and believed that this model would discipline the national democratic impulse, transcending regionalisms and social differences, refine the taste of capitalists and contribute to elevating society and improving its culture.

====Other countries====
Academic art not only held influence in Western Europe and the United States, but also extended its influence to other countries. The artistic environment of Greece, for instance, was dominated by techniques from Western academies from the 17th century onward: this was first evident in the activities of the Ionian school, and later became especially pronounced with the dawn of the Munich school. This was also true for Latin American nations, which, because their revolutions were modeled on the French Revolution, sought to emulate French culture. An example of a Latin American academic artist is Ángel Zárraga of Mexico. Academic art in Poland flourished under Jan Matejko, who established the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts. Many of these works can be seen in the Gallery of 19th-Century Polish Art at Sukiennice in Kraków.

==Academic training==

===Teaching principles and cursus===
The academies had as a basic assumption the idea that art could be taught through its systematization into a fully communicable body of theory and practice, minimizing the importance of creativity as an entirely original and individual contribution. Instead, they valued the emulation of established masters, venerating the classical tradition, and adopted collectively formulated concepts that had not only an aesthetic character, but also an ethical origin and purpose.

Young artists spent four years in rigorous training. In France, only students who passed an exam and carried a letter of reference from a noted professor of art were accepted at the academy&#x27;s school, the (School of Fine Arts). Drawings and paintings of the nude, called &quot;académies&quot;, were the basic building blocks of academic art and the procedure for learning to make them was clearly defined. First, students copied prints after classical sculptures, becoming familiar with the principles of contour, light, and shade. The copy was believed crucial to the academic education; from copying works of past artists one would assimilate their methods of artmaking. To advance to the next step, and every successive one, students presented drawings for evaluation.

If approved, they would then draw from plaster casts of famous classical sculptures. Only after acquiring these skills were artists permitted entrance to classes in which a live model posed. Painting was not taught at the École des Beaux-Arts until after 1863. To learn to paint with a brush, the student first had to demonstrate proficiency in drawing, which was considered the foundation of academic painting. Only then could the pupil join the studio of an academician and learn how to paint. Throughout the entire process, competitions with a predetermined subject and a specific allotted period of time measured each student&#x27;s progress.

The most famous art competition for students was the Prix de Rome, whose winner was awarded a fellowship to study at the Académie française&#x27;s school at the Villa Medici in Rome for up to five years. To compete, an artist had to be of French nationality, male, under 30 years of age, and single. He had to have met the entrance requirements of the École des Beaux-Arts and have the support of a well-known art teacher. The competition was grueling, involving several stages before the final one, in which 10 competitors were sequestered in studios for 72 days to paint their final history paintings. The winner was essentially assured a successful professional career.

As noted, a successful showing at the Salon, the exhibition of work founded by the École des Beaux-Arts, was a seal of approval for an artist. Artists petitioned the hanging committee for optimal placement &quot;on the line&quot;, or at eye level. After the exhibition opened, artists complained if their works were &quot;skyed&quot;, or hung too high. The ultimate achievement for the professional artist was election to membership in the Académie française and the right to be known as an academician. This depended on his consistency in exhibitions at the salons and the permanence of his production at a level of excellence.

===Women artists===

One effect of the move to academies was to make training more difficult for women artists, who were excluded from most academies until the last half of the 19th century. This was partly because of concerns over the perceived impropriety presented by nudity during training. In France, for example, the powerful École des Beaux-Arts had 450 members between the 17th century and the French Revolution, of which only 15 were women. Of those, most were daughters or wives of members. In the late 18th century, the French Academy resolved not to admit any women at all. As a result, there are no extant large-scale history paintings by women from this period, though some women like Marie-Denise Villers and Constance Mayer made their name in other genres such as portraiture.

In spite of this, there were important steps forward for female artists. In Paris, the Salon became open to non-Academic painters in 1791, allowing women to showcase their work in the prestigious annual exhibition. Additionally, women were more frequently being accepted as students by famous artists such as Jacques-Louis David and Jean-Baptiste Greuze.

The emphasis in academic art on studies of the nude remained a considerable barrier for women studying art until the 20th century, both in terms of actual access to the classes and in terms of family and social attitudes to middle-class women becoming artists.

==Criticism and legacy==

===Decline and the rise of modernism===
Academic art was first criticized for its use of idealism, by Realist artists such as Gustave Courbet, as being based on idealistic clichés and representing mythical and legendary motives while contemporary social concerns were being ignored. Another criticism by Realists was the &quot;false surface&quot; of paintings—the objects depicted looked smooth, slick, and idealized—showing no real texture. The Realist Théodule Ribot worked against this by experimenting with rough, unfinished textures in his painting.

Stylistically, the Impressionists, who advocated quickly painting outdoors exactly what the eye sees and the hand puts down, criticized the finished and idealized painting style. Although academic painters began a painting by first making drawings and then painting oil sketches of their subject, the high polish they gave to their drawings seemed to the Impressionists tantamount to a lie, who disavowed the devotion to mechanical techniques.

Realists and Impressionists also defied the placement of still-life and landscape at the bottom of the hierarchy of genres. Most Realists and Impressionists and others among the early avant-garde who rebelled against academism were originally students in academic . Claude Monet, Gustave Courbet, Édouard Manet, and even Henri Matisse were students under academic artists. Other artists, such as the Symbolist painters and some of the Surrealists, were kinder to the tradition. As painters who sought to bring imaginary vistas to life, these artists were more willing to learn from a strongly representational tradition. Once the tradition had come to be looked on as old-fashioned, the allegorical nudes and theatrically posed figures struck some viewers as bizarre and dreamlike.

As modern art and its avant-garde gained more power, academic art was further denigrated, and seen as sentimental, clichéd, conservative, non-innovative, bourgeois, and &quot;styleless&quot;. The French referred derisively to the style of academic art as &quot;L&#x27;art pompier&quot; (&quot;pompier&quot; means &quot;fireman&quot;) alluding to the paintings of Jacques-Louis David (who was held in esteem by the academy), which often depicted soldiers wearing fireman-like helmets. It also suggests half-puns in French with &quot;pompéien&quot; (&quot;from Pompeii&quot;) and &quot;pompeux&quot; (&quot;pompous&quot;). The paintings were called &quot;grandes machines&quot;, which were said to have manufactured false emotion through contrivances and tricks.

Faced with the dissatisfaction of a growing number of artists excluded from the official salons of the French Academy, in 1863 Emperor Napoleon III established the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the Refused), which is considered one of the initial milestones of modernism. Even with this concession, the public reaction was negative, and an anonymous review published at the time summarizes the general attitude:
Following the example of Courbet, who in 1855 had opened a solo exhibition he called the Pavillon du Réalisme (Pavilion of Realism), in 1867 Manet, rejected from the official Salon, exhibited independently, and six years later a group of Impressionists founded the Salon des Indépendants (Salon of Independents). As a result of these initiatives, the art market began to open up to alternative schools, while dealers for new creators and private societies began aggressive campaigns to publicize their own artists, opening up various exhibition spaces to capture the interest of the bourgeois consumer public. Independent critics and literati also played an important role in shifting the economic and social center of gravity of the art system, protecting and promoting various non-academic artists and providing a kind of informal public education through the publication of articles in the press, which became a major forum for artistic debate, and one with a wide reach. In this process, the official institution of the Academy, by then renamed the École des Beaux-Arts and having severed its connection with the government, began to lose ground rapidly, beginning its decline as a consecrating and educational institution.

===Complete denigration and fall into obscurity===
British art critic Clive Bell, linked to the Bloomsbury Group of English modernism, stated in 1914 that, by the middle of the 19th century, art had &quot;died&quot;, losing all its aesthetic interest, and even tradition had ceased to exist. This denigration of academic art reached its peak through the writings of American art critic Clement Greenberg who stated in 1939 that all academic art is &quot;kitsch&quot;, in the sense of banal, commercialist, and tried to associate academicism with the problems of industrial capitalism, in addition to linking a new concept of &quot;good taste&quot; with the ethics of left-wing, anti-bourgeois political radicalism. For him, the avant-garde was positive because it was an affective expression of a libertarian social conscience, and was therefore truer and freer, which was repeated ad infinitum afterwards, following the logic: academic = reactionary = bad, versus avant-garde = radical = good.

Several other influential critics, such as Herbert Read and Ernst Gombrich, devoted great efforts to breaking away from traditional academic standards. In all matters of teaching, not just in art teaching, great importance was given to creativity as the starting point for the learning process, preaching the abandonment of rules and formalisms, and aligning themselves with the proposals of educators and educational philosophers such as Maria Montessori and Jean-Ovide Decroly. Even several of the most important modern artists, such as Kandinsky, Klee, Malevich and Moholy-Nagy, dedicated themselves to creating schools and formulating new theories for art education based on these ideas, most notably the Bauhaus, founded in Weimar, Germany, in 1919 by Walter Gropius. For modernists, creativity was an innate faculty of perception and imagination, possessed by all people, and the less it was influenced by theories and norms, the richer and more fertile it would be. In this context, art education simply aimed to provide the means for this free creativity, guided by feelings and emotions, to be expressed materially as a work of art, a unique and original form that had its own syntax and did not depend on previous references.

Mannerist, Baroque, Rococo and neoclassical academic production managed to pass relatively unscathed by modernist criticism and secure its place in history, but eclectic academic trends of the second half of the 19th century were ridiculed and devalued to the point that, throughout the 20th century, most of these works were discarded from private collections, saw their market prices plummet and were removed from display in museums, relegated to oblivion in their storerooms. By the 1950s, all the last practitioners of the old academicism had been cast into obscurity. More than that, pure opposition to academicism had become one of the main cohesive forces of the modern movement, and the only thing that interested critics linked to the avant-garde was the avant-garde itself.

===Critical recovery===
Despite the widespread discredit into which academicism fell, several researchers throughout the 20th century undertook the study of the academic phenomenon. Art historian Paul Barlow stated that despite the wide dissemination of modernism at the beginning of the 20th century, the theoretical bases of its rejection of academicism were surprisingly little explored by its proponents, forming above all a kind of &quot;anti-academic myth&quot;, more than a consistent critique. Of all those engaged in this study, Nikolaus Pevsner was perhaps the most important, describing in the 1940s the history of academies on an epic scale, but focusing on the institutional and organizational aspects, disconnecting them from the aesthetic and geographical ones.

Many authors agree that the birth of modernism can be described as the end of collective values and the denial of art as essentially a vehicle for moral principles. It is true that moralizing and historical works continued to be produced throughout the 20th century, but with a completely different impact, when in the Victorian period morality had come to mean above all chastity. Modernism has also been described as responsible for a process of pulverizing hierarchies and for the beginning of the reign of individualism and subjectivity in art, in a much deeper way than had already been suggested by the Romantics or even by the Mannerists much earlier, creating a multiplicity of personal aesthetics that were not consolidated into a common and uniform language, with little or no concern for inserting production into an organized system or creating socially engaged art. They are even accused of having practiced their own version of the elitist dictatorship that they condemned in academicism.

With the goals of Postmodernism in giving a fuller, more sociological and pluralistic account of history, academic art has been brought back into history books and discussion. Since the early 1990s, the creation of academic art has even experienced a limited resurgence through the Classical Realist atelier movement. In museums and art galleries, &quot;L&#x27;art pompier&quot; (a term supporters mostly avoid) has also enjoyed something of a critical revival, partly caused by the Musée d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, where it is displayed on more equal terms with the Impressionists and Realist painters of the period. The opening of this museum in 1986 did not go without heated debate in France, as it was seen by some critics as a rehabilitation of academicism, or even &quot;revisionism&quot;. The art historian André Chastel, however, considered as early as 1973 that there were &quot;nothing but advantages in replacing a global judgment of disapproval, the legacy of old battles, with a quiet and objective curiosity.&quot; Some other institutional agents of this rescue are the Dahesh Museum of Art in the United States, which specializes in academic art of the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as the Art Renewal Center, also based in the United States and dedicated to promoting academicism as a basis for the qualified training of future masters. Additionally, the art is gaining a broader appreciation by the public at large, and whereas academic paintings once would only fetch a few hundreds of dollars in auctions, some now fetch millions.

<text>The Victoria History of the Counties of England, commonly known as the Victoria County History or the VCH, is an English history project which began in 1899 with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the historic counties of England, and was dedicated to Queen Victoria. In 2012 the project was rededicated to Queen Elizabeth II in celebration of her Diamond Jubilee year. Since 1933 the project has been coordinated by the Institute of Historical Research in the University of London.

==History==
The history of the VCH falls into three main phases, defined by different funding regimes: an early phase, 1899–1914, when the project was conceived as a commercial enterprise, and progress was rapid; a second more desultory phase, 1914–1947, when relatively little progress was made; and the third phase beginning in 1947, when, under the auspices of the Institute of Historical Research, a high academic standard was set, and progress has been slow but reasonably steady.

These phases have also been characterised by changing attitudes towards the proper scope of English local history. The early volumes were planned on the model of traditional English county histories, with a strong emphasis on manorial descents, the advowsons of parish churches, and the local landed gentry: a prospectus of stated that &quot;there is &quot;no Englishman&quot; to whom [the VCH] does not in some one or other of its features make a direct appeal&quot;. More recent volumes – especially those published since the 1950s – have been more wide-ranging in their approach, and have included systematic coverage of social and economic history, industrial history, population history, educational history, landscape history, religious nonconformity, and so on; individual parish histories have consequently grown considerably in length and complexity.

From 1902 the joint general editors were H. Arthur Doubleday and William Page. Doubleday resigned (in acrimonious circumstances) in 1904, leaving Page as sole general editor until his death in 1934. In 1932 Page bought the rights to the ailing project for a nominal sum, donating it to the Institute of Historical Research the following year. Page was succeeded as general editor by L. F. Salzman, who remained in post until 1949. The early volumes depended heavily on the efforts of a large number of young research workers, mostly female, fresh from degree courses at Oxford, Cambridge, London or the Scottish universities, for whom other employment opportunities were limited: the VCH of this period has been described as &quot;a history for gentlemen largely researched by ladies&quot;.

From 1909 until 1931 Frederick Smith, later 2nd Viscount Hambleden, was the VCH&#x27;s major sponsor. In February 2005 the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded the VCH £3,374,000 to fund the England&#x27;s Past for Everyone project, which ran from September that year until February 2010.

==Progress==

The first VCH volume was published in 1901, and publication continued slowly throughout the 20th century, although in some counties it has come to a halt, especially during World War I and again in the 1970s. Some inactive counties have recently been reactivated.

There are now more than 230 VCH volumes, with around three new volumes published per year. Each is published with a red cover, and they are therefore sometimes known as &quot;the big red books&quot;. When the Institute of Historical Research published a short history of the project to mark the 75th anniversary of taking it over, it was titled &quot;The Little Big Red Book&quot;. A special edition Jubilee book was published in 2012, &quot;A Diamond Jubilee Celebration 1899–2012.&quot;

A map showing the publication status appears on the VCH website.

==Structure and content of the county histories==
From its inception, responsibility for writing the volumes was delegated to local editors for each individual county. The county editors traditionally worked under the direction of a general editor, following a uniform format and style.

In general, the histories begin with one or more volumes of general studies of the county as a whole, including major themes, such as religious history, agriculture, industries, population (with summary tables of decennial census totals 1801–1901), and an introduction to and translation of the relevant section of Domesday Book. These volumes are followed by others consisting of detailed historical surveys of each Hundred, Wapentake (discussed in separate riding volumes) and ward, parish by parish. At first, ancient ecclesiastical parishes formed the unit of investigation, but since the mid-1950s the VCH parish is the civil parish, the modern successor of the ancient parishes or of townships within them. Large towns are dealt with as a whole, including, since the 1960s, built-up areas of adjoining, formerly rural parishes.

Under the original plan, each county, in addition to its general and topographical volumes, was to have a genealogical volume containing the pedigrees of county families. Genealogical volumes were published in a large folio format for Northamptonshire (1906) and Hertfordshire (1907), but the research costs were found to be excessive, and this side of the project was discontinued.

==Completed county histories==
Some of the county histories have been completed, as follows:

==Counties in progress==
For each uncompleted county history on which work is continuing (i.e.: &quot;active&quot; in VCH terminology), progress is as follows:

==Dormant counties==

Several volumes are not currently being worked on.

==Counties with no published volumes==
* Northumberland produced its own, non-VCH, history in 15 volumes, published by the Northumberland County History Committee, completed in 1940.
* Monmouthshire, sometimes regarded between the 16th and 20th centuries as an English county, has never been treated as such by the VCH, and has never been proposed for inclusion within the project. A non-VCH county history of Gwent/Monmouthshire was published by the University of Wales Press in five volumes between 2004 and 2013.
* Westmorland has not yet produced a VCH volume, but the area is included within the VCH Cumbria project.

== Online availability ==
Much of the content of the older VCH volumes is now accessible via the &quot;British History Online&quot; digital library, digitised by double rekeying. Priority has been given to the topographical volumes containing histories of individual parishes. The more general introductory volumes are excluded for the time being, with the exception of those sections covering the religious houses of each county.

<doc id="380103" wikidata="Q5378346" url="?curid=380103" title="English Place-Name Society">
<text>The English Place-Name Society (EPNS) is a learned society concerned with toponomastics and the toponymy of England, in other words, the study of place-names (toponyms).

Its scholars aim to explain the origin and history of the names they study, taking into account factors such as the meaning of the elements out of which they were created (whether from the principal endemic tongues Old English, early Welsh, Danish, Norwegian, Cornish, Latin, Norman French – or others); the topography, geology and ecology of the places bearing the names; and the general and local history and culture of England.

==History==
In 1922 Professor Allen Mawer read a paper to the British Academy proposing a survey of English place-names. He obtained the formal and financial support of the academy. Within a year he had brought into being a society composed of interested persons, provided it with a constitution, and laid down the lines of its future conduct. The headquarters of the Society were first at the University of Liverpool, where Mawer was professor of the English language. The publications of the Society began in 1924, with two volumes: a collection of essays and a dictionary of place-name elements. Mawer and Aileen Armstrong acted as general editors for the annual volumes of county place-name surveys. Starting in 1929, J. E. B. Gover collected material and was sub-editor of the volumes.

In 1929, Professor Mawer was appointed provost of University College, London, and the Society moved there at the end of the year. At the outbreak of World War II, the Society removed briefly to University College, Aberystwyth, back to London, and then to Stansted Bury, Stanstead Abbotts, in eastern Hertfordshire. In July 1942, Sir Allen Mawer died, and Sir Frank Stenton became general editor. The Society moved to the University of Reading until 1946. When Professor Bruce Dickins succeeded as honorary director, the Society removed to the University of Cambridge and Miss Margaret Midgley (later Dr Margaret Gelling) was appointed research assistant.

When Professor Hugh Smith assumed the position of honorary director in 1951, University College, London, became once more the Society&#x27;s headquarters, with Margaret Midgley continuing research there until 1953. Hugh Smith produced two new &quot;Elements&quot; volumes and 14 others on county place-names. Upon his death in 1967, Professor Kenneth Cameron became honorary director and the Society&#x27;s offices were split between London and Nottingham, where the university provided room for the library and archives, as well as the services of a secretary. In 1972 the Society moved completely to Nottingham, where it remains at the Centre for Name Studies. Victor Watts became honorary director in 1992 until his death in 2002, when he was succeeded by Professor Richard Coates.

The survey has been consistently supported, morally and practically, by the British Academy. From 2005 to 2010, it was supported as well by a large grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Council.

==Research breakthroughs==
From the 1960s detailed comparison of distributions of the place-name types which had been thought to be early Saxon – and of archaeological evidence – has produced a re-written interpretation of some. The net effect, statistically, has been to find an original bias towards Anglo-Saxon. This means more names re-attributed, than the reverse, have been shown to be more likely Celtic. In particular, Kenneth Jackson contributed to much of the research, identification and morphology of Celtic names.

==Publications==
===Traditional county or county subdivision publications===
The Society divides England firstly by traditional counties. The vast majority (or more convenient subdivisions) are sequentially covered in 96 volumes of the &quot;Survey of English Place-Names&quot;, although the earlier volumes are less detailed. These are used mainly by scholars and academia. The volumes for Warwickshire and much of Yorkshire (the North and East Ridings and parts of the West Riding) are available free of charge on the society&#x27;s website. In 2016, the Society published its first volume in the &quot;Popular Series&quot;, on the county of Suffolk.

===Other publications===
By 2018 the society had published a range of other books and booklets by category (e.g. field-names), and some county dictionaries aimed mainly at a non-specialist audience.

The Society is publishing a 2010s series of booklets on place-name elements, running in to the 2020s.

Since 1969, the Society has published an annual &quot;Journal&quot;, which contains essays on various place-name topics.

===Substantial citation===
EPNS material was used as the basis of &quot;The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names&quot;, published in 2004.

<text>Freedom Summer, also known as Mississippi Freedom Summer (sometimes referred to as the Freedom Summer Project or the Mississippi Summer Project), was a campaign launched by American civil rights activists in June 1964 to register as many African-American voters as possible in the state of Mississippi. 

Black people in the state had been largely prevented from voting since the turn of the 20th century due to barriers to voter registration and other Jim Crow laws that had been enacted throughout the American South. The project also set up dozens of Freedom Schools, Freedom Houses, and community centers such as libraries, in small towns throughout Mississippi to aid the local Black population.

The project was organized by the Council of Federated Organizations (COFO), a coalition of the Mississippi branches of the four major civil rights organizations (SNCC, CORE, NAACP, and SCLC). Most of the impetus, leadership, and financing for the Summer Project came from SNCC. Bob Moses, SNCC field secretary and co-director of COFO, directed the summer project.

==Freedom Vote==

Freedom Summer was built on the years of earlier work by thousands of African Americans, connected through their churches, who lived in Mississippi. In 1963, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) organized a mock &quot;Freedom Vote&quot; designed to demonstrate the will of Black Mississippians to vote, if not impeded by terror and intimidation. The Mississippi voting registration procedure at the time required Black people to fill out a 21-question registration form and to answer, to the satisfaction of the white registrators, a question on the interpretation of any one of 285 sections of the state constitution. The registrars ruled subjectively on the applicant&#x27;s qualifications, and decided against most Black people, not allowing them to register.

In 1963, volunteers set up polling places in Black churches and business establishments across Mississippi. After registering on a simple registration form, voters would select candidates to run in the following year&#x27;s election. Candidates included Rev. Ed King of Tougaloo College and Aaron Henry, from Clarksdale, Mississippi. Local civil rights workers and volunteers, along with students from northern and western universities, organized and implemented the mock election, in which tens of thousands voted.

==February 1964 planning==

By 1964, students and others had begun the process of integrating public accommodations, registering adults to vote, and above all strengthening a network of local leadership. Building on the efforts of 1963 (including the Freedom Vote and registration efforts in Greenwood), Moses prevailed over doubts among SNCC and COFO workers, and planning for Freedom Summer began in February 1964. Speakers recruited for workers on college campuses across the country, drawing standing ovations for their dedication in braving the routine violence perpetrated by police, sheriffs, and others in Mississippi. SNCC recruiters interviewed dozens of potential volunteers, weeding out those with a &quot;John Brown complex&quot; and informing others that their job that summer would not be to &quot;save the Mississippi Negro&quot; but to work with local leadership to develop the grassroots movement.

More than 1,000 out-of-state volunteers participated in Freedom Summer alongside thousands of black Mississippians. Volunteers were the brightest of their generation, who came from the best universities from the biggest states, mostly from cities in the North (e.g., Chicago, New York City, Detroit, Cleveland, etc.) and West (e.g., Berkeley, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, etc.), usually were rich, 90 percent were white. About half of them were Jewish. Though SNCC&#x27;s committee agreed to recruit only one hundred white students for the project in December 1963, Jewish civil rights leaders such as Allard Lowenstein went on and recruited a much larger number of white volunteers, to bring more attention. Two one-week orientation sessions for the volunteers were held at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio (now part of Miami University), from June 14 to June 27, after Berea College backed out of hosting the sessions due to alumni pressure against it.

Organizers focused on Mississippi because it had the lowest percentage of any state in the country of African Americans registered to vote, and they constituted more than one-third of the population. In 1962 only 6.7% of eligible black voters were registered.

Southern states had effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites in the period from 1890 to 1910 by passing state constitutions, amendments and other laws that imposed burdens on voter registration: charging poll taxes, requiring literacy tests administered subjectively by white registrars, making residency requirements more difficult, as well as elaborate record keeping to document required items. They maintained this exclusion of Black people from politics well into the 1960s, which extended to excluding them from juries and imposing Jim Crow segregation laws for public facilities.

Most of these methods survived US Supreme Court challenges and, if overruled, states had quickly developed new ways to exclude Black people, such as use of grandfather clauses and white primaries. In some cases, would-be voters were harassed economically, as well as by physical assault. Lynchings had been high at the turn of the century and continued for years.

During the ten weeks of Freedom Summer, a number of other organizations provided support for the COFO Summer Project. More than 100 volunteer doctors, nurses, psychologists, medical students and other medical professionals from the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR) provided emergency care for volunteers and local activists, taught health education classes, and advocated improvements in Mississippi&#x27;s segregated health system.

Volunteer lawyers from the NAACP Legal Defense Fund Inc (&quot;Ink Fund&quot;), National Lawyers Guild, Lawyer&#x27;s Constitutional Defense Committee (LCDC) an arm of the ACLU, and the Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (LCCR) provided free legal services — handling arrests, freedom of speech, voter registration and other matters.

The Commission on Religion and Race (CORR), an endeavor of the National Council of Churches (NCC), brought Christian and Jewish clergy and divinity students to Mississippi to support the work of the Summer Project. In addition to offering traditional religious support to volunteers and activists, the ministers and rabbis engaged in voting rights protests at courthouses, recruited voter applicants and accompanied them to register, taught in Freedom Schools, and performed office and other support functions.

==Violence==
Many of Mississippi&#x27;s white residents deeply resented the outsiders and any attempt to change the residents&#x27; society. Locals routinely harassed volunteers. The volunteers&#x27; presence in local black communities drew drive-by shootings, Molotov cocktails thrown at host homes, and constant harassment. State and local governments, the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission (which was tax-supported and spied on citizens), police, White Citizens&#x27; Council, and Ku Klux Klan used arrests, arson, beatings, evictions, firing, murder, spying, and other forms of intimidation and harassment to oppose the project and prevent Black people from registering to vote or achieve social equality.

Over the course of the ten-week project:
* 1,062 people were arrested (out-of-state volunteers and locals)
* 80 Freedom Summer workers were beaten
* 37 churches were bombed or burned
* 30 Black homes or businesses were bombed or burned
* 4 civil rights workers were killed (one in a head-on collision)
* 4 people were critically wounded
* At least 3 Mississippi Black people were murdered because of their support for the Civil Rights Movement

Volunteers were attacked almost as soon as the campaign started. On June 21, 1964, James Chaney (a black Congress of Racial Equality [CORE] activist from Mississippi), Andrew Goodman (a summer volunteer), and Michael Schwerner (a CORE organizer) – both Jews from New York City – were arrested by Cecil Price, a Neshoba County deputy sheriff and KKK member. The three were held in jail until after nightfall, then released. They drove away into an ambush on the road by Klansmen, who abducted and killed them. Goodman and Schwerner were shot at point-blank range. Chaney was chased, beaten mercilessly, and shot three times. After weeks of searching in which federal law enforcement participated, on August 4, 1964, their bodies were found to have been buried in an earthen dam. The men&#x27;s disappearance the night of their release from jail was reported on TV and on newspaper front pages, shocking the nation. It drew massive media attention to Freedom Summer and to Mississippi&#x27;s &quot;closed society.&quot;

When the men went missing, SNCC and COFO workers began phoning the FBI requesting an investigation. The parents of the missing children were able to put so much pressure on Washington that meetings with President Johnson and Attorney General Robert Kennedy were arranged. Finally, after some 36 hours, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy authorized the FBI to get involved in the search. FBI agents began swarming around Philadelphia, Mississippi, where Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner had been arrested after they had investigated the burning of a local black church that was a center for political organizing. For the next seven weeks, FBI agents and sailors from a nearby naval airbase searched for the bodies, wading into swamps and hacking through underbrush. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover went to Mississippi on July 10 to open the first FBI branch office there.

Throughout the search, Mississippi newspapers and word-of-mouth perpetuated the common belief that the disappearance was &quot;a hoax&quot; designed to draw publicity. The search of rivers and swamps turned up the bodies of eight other Black people who appeared to have been murdered: a boy and seven men. Herbert Oarsby, a 14-year-old youth, was found wearing a CORE T-shirt. Charles Eddie Moore was among 600 students expelled in April 1964 from Alcorn A&amp;M for participating in civil rights protests. After he returned home, he was abducted and killed by KKK members in Franklin County, Mississippi on May 2, 1964 with his friend Henry Hezekiah Dee. The other five men were never identified. When they disappeared, their families could not get local law enforcement to investigate.

==Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party==

With participation in the regular Mississippi Democratic Party blocked by segregationists, COFO established the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) as a non-exclusionary rival to the regular party organization. It intended to gain recognition of the MFDP by the national Democratic Party as the legitimate party organization in Mississippi. Delegates were elected to go to the Democratic national convention to be held that year.

Before the convention was held, Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson gained passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

When the forces of white supremacy continued to block black voter registration, the Summer Project switched to building the MFDP. Though the MFDP challenge had wide support among many convention delegates, Lyndon B. Johnson feared losing Southern support in the coming campaign. He did not allow the MFDP to replace the regulars, but the continuing issue of political oppression in Mississippi was covered widely by the national press.

==Freedom Schools==

In addition to voter registration and the MFDP, the Summer Project also established a network of 30 to 40 voluntary summer schools – called &quot;Freedom Schools,&quot; an educational program proposed by SNCC member, Charlie Cobb – as an alternative to Mississippi&#x27;s totally segregated and underfunded schools for Black people. Over the course of the summer, more than 3,500 students attended Freedom Schools, which taught subjects that the public schools avoided, such as black history and constitutional rights.

Freedom Schools were held in churches, on back porches, and under the trees of Mississippi. Students ranged from small children to elderly adults, with the average age around 15. Most of the volunteer teachers were college students. Under the direction of Spelman College professor Staughton Lynd, the goal was to teach voter literacy, and political organization skills, as well as academic skills, and to help with confidence. The curriculum was directly linked to the formation of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. As Ed King, who ran for Lieutenant Governor on the MFDP ticket, stated, &quot;Our assumption was that the parents of the Freedom School children, when we met them at night, that the Freedom Democratic Party would be the PTA.&quot;

The Freedom Schools operated on a basis of close interaction and mutual trust between teachers and students. The core curriculum focused on basic literacy and arithmetic, black history and current status, political processes, civil rights, and the freedom movement. The content varied from place to place and day to day according to the questions and interests of the students.

The volunteer Freedom School teachers were as profoundly affected by their experience as were the students. Pam Parker, a teacher in the Holly Springs school, wrote of the experience:

The atmosphere in the class is unbelievable. It is what every teacher dreams about — real, honest enthusiasm and desire to learn anything and everything. The girls come to class of their own free will. They respond to everything that is said. They are excited about learning. They drain me of everything that I have to offer so that I go home at night completely exhausted but very happy in spirit ...

== Freedom Libraries ==
Approximately fifty Freedom libraries were established throughout Mississippi. These libraries provided library services and literacy guidance for many African Americans, some who had never had access to libraries before. Freedom Libraries ranged in size from a few hundred volumes to more than 20,000. The Freedom Libraries operated on small budgets and were usually run by volunteers. Some libraries were housed in newly constructed facilities while others were located in abandoned buildings.

== Freedom Houses ==

The volunteers were housed by local black families who refused to be intimidated by segregationist threats of violence. However, project organizers were unable to place all the volunteers in private homes. To accommodate the overflow, the remaining volunteers were placed either in the project office or in &quot;Freedom Houses.&quot; Volunteers believed that it was important to free themselves from their race and class backgrounds, so the Freedom Houses would become places where cultural exchange would happen, so the Freedom Houses were free from segregation.

Of course, the practice of group living was already well established among American college students, for example, and soon the houses became communal living centers. Freedom houses also played a significant role in the volunteers&#x27; sexual activities during the summer. They considered themselves free from the restraints of racism and consequently free to truly love one another. As such, for many of them, interracial sex became the ultimate expression of SNCC ideology, which emphasized the notions of freedom and equality. At the beginning of the summer the Freedom Houses were places to accommodate the overflow of volunteers, but in the eyes of volunteers by the end of summer they had become structural and symbolical expressions of the link between personal and political change. One volunteer said:

You never knew what was going to happen [in the Freedom Houses] from one minute to the next ... I slept on the cot ... on a kind of side porch ... and ... I&#x27;d drag in some nights and there&#x27;d ... be a wild party raging on the porch. So I&#x27;d drag my cot off in search of a quiet corner ... [only to find] an intense philosophical discussion going on in one corner ... people making peanut butter sandwiches-always peanut butter ... in another ... [And] some soap opera ... romantic entanglement being played out in another ... It was real three-ring circus 

==Aftermath==
Freedom Summer did not succeed in getting many voters registered, but it had a significant effect on the course of the Civil Rights Movement. It helped break down the decades of isolation and repression that had supported the Jim Crow system. Before Freedom Summer, the national news media had paid little attention to the persecution of Black voters in the Deep South and the dangers endured by Black civil rights workers. The events that summer had captured national attention, as had the mass protests and demonstrations in previous years.

However, some Black activists felt that the media had responded only because Northern white students were killed, and felt embittered. Many Black people also felt that the white students were condescending and paternalistic to the local people and were rising to an inappropriate dominance in the Civil Rights Movement. Leading up to the November 1964 election, repression persisted in Mississippi, with nuisance arrests, beatings, and church burnings continuing. The discontent with the white students and the increasing need for armed defense against segregationists helped create demand for a Black Power direction in SNCC.

Many of the volunteers have recounted that the summer was one of the defining periods of their lives. They had trouble readjusting to life outside Mississippi. They came with a positive image of the government, but the events of the Freedom Summer upset this simplistic distinction between &#x27;good guys&#x27; and &#x27;bad guys&#x27;. They saw that those two ideas were linked together. They experienced such lawlessness that they became critical toward American society and federal agencies, like the FBI. Most of the volunteers became politicized in Mississippi. They left intent on carrying on the fight in the North. After that summer, many Christians faced a religious crisis. Personal transformation of volunteers led to social changes. It increased student activity in the civil rights movement. These students also played a role later in the resurgence of leftist activism in the United States.

Long-term volunteers staffed the COFO and SNCC offices throughout Mississippi. After the flood of summer workers in 1964, their leadership decided that projects should continue the following summer, but under the direction of local leadership. This was challenged by Northern establishment members of the coalition, beginning with Americans for Democratic Action, who also disapproved of the MFDP. This encouraged the NAACP to withdraw from COFO, both because they did not want to anger liberal Democrats, and because they resented the organizational competition from SNCC. After the MFDP was denied voting status at the 1964 Democratic National Convention, Bob Moses was deeply disillusioned and bowed out of both MFDP and COFO. COFO collapsed in 1965, leaving organizing priorities to be set by locals.

Among many notable veterans of Freedom Summer were Heather Booth, Marshall Ganz, and Mario Savio. After the summer, Heather Booth returned to Illinois, where she became a founder of the Chicago Women&#x27;s Liberation Union and later the Midwest Academy. Marshall Ganz returned to California, where he worked for many years on the staff of the United Farm Workers. He later taught organizing strategies. In 2008 he played a crucial role in organizing Barack Obama&#x27;s field staff for the campaign. Mario Savio returned to the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a leader of the Free Speech Movement, which sprang up spontaneously in October 1964 in response to the university&#x27;s attempt to shut down informational tabling and fundraising by student activists on behalf of the Civil Rights Movement.

In Mississippi, controversy raged over the three murders. Mississippi state and local officials did not indict anyone. The FBI continued to investigate. Agents infiltrated the KKK and paid informers to reveal secrets of their &quot;klaverns&quot;. In the fall of 1964, informants told the FBI about the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. On December 4, the FBI arrested 19 men as suspects.
All were freed on a technicality, starting a three-year battle to bring them to justice. In October 1967, the men, including the Klan&#x27;s Imperial Wizard Samuel Bowers, who had allegedly ordered the murders, went on trial in the federal courthouse in Meridian. Seven were ultimately convicted of federal crimes related to the murders. All were sentenced to 3–10 years, but none served more than six years. This marked the first time since Reconstruction era that white men had been convicted of civil rights violations against Black people in Mississippi.
Mississippi began to make some racial progress but white supremacy was resilient, especially in rural areas. In 1965 Congress passed the federal Voting Rights Act, which provided for federal oversight and enforcement to facilitate registration and voting in areas of historically low turnout. Mississippi&#x27;s legislature passed several laws to dilute the power of black votes. Only with Supreme Court rulings and more than a decade of cooling did black voting become a reality in Mississippi. The seeds planted during Freedom Summer bore fruit in the 1980s and 1990s, when Mississippi elected more black officials than any other state. Since redistricting in 2003, Mississippi has had four congressional districts. Mississippi&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, covering a concentration of black population in the western part of the state, including the Mississippi Delta, is black majority.

Renewed investigation of the 1964 murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner led to a trial by the state in 2005. As a result of investigative reporting by Jerry Mitchell (an award-winning reporter for the &quot;Jackson Clarion-Ledger&quot;), high school teacher Barry Bradford, and three of his students from Illinois (Brittany Saltiel, Sarah Siegel, and Allison Nichols), Edgar Ray Killen, one of the leaders of the killings and a former Ku Klux Klan klavern recruiter, was indicted for murder. He was convicted of three counts of manslaughter. The Killen verdict was announced on June 21, 2005, the forty-first anniversary of the crime. Killen&#x27;s lawyers appealed the verdict, but his sentence of 3 times 20 years in prison was upheld on January 12, 2007, in a hearing by the Supreme Court of Mississippi.

In a 2009 article, Stanford historian James T. Campbell highlights Freedom Summer as an example where structured efforts to reconcile conflicting historical views—held by white and Black Mississippians—could have lessened the event&#x27;s lasting effects. Although Campbell doesn&#x27;t directly call for a truth and reconciliation commission for the events of 1964, he suggests that the violent outcomes stemmed from two opposing interpretations of history. Specifically, he argues that many white Mississippians believed distorted narratives about Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Movement, seeing them as &quot;reverse white victimization,&quot; which contributed to the violence during Freedom Summer. These unresolved conflicts, Campbell believes, continue to fuel racial divisions in Mississippi today. He emphasizes the need for formal efforts to address and heal from past injustices, like those of Freedom Summer.

<text>The Maison du Roi (, &#x27;King&#x27;s Household&#x27;) was the royal household of the King of France. It comprised the military, domestic, and religious entourage of the French royal family during the Ancien Régime and Bourbon Restoration. 
== Organisation ==
The exact composition and duties of its various divisions changed constantly over the Early Modern period. Officers of the Maison du Roi were directly responsible to the &quot;Grand maître de France&quot; (Chief Steward). Starting in the 16th century and then from the 17th century on, the Maison du Roi was overseen by a ministry, the &quot;Département de la Maison du Roi&quot;, directed by a secretary of state, the &quot;Secrétaire d&#x27;État à la Maison du Roi&quot;. The structure of the Maison du Roi was officially reorganized under Henry III in 1578 and 1585, and in the 17th century by Jean-Baptiste Colbert.

==The Military Maison du Roi==
The military branch of the Maison du Roi was the French Army Lifeguard brigade, made up of cavalry and infantry units. Officer rank was only open to gentlemen, though some of its units were drawn from elite troops among commoners in the rest of the army. It was not ceremonial and participated in all of France&#x27;s 16th- and 17th-century campaigns.

==The Religious Maison du Roi==
The Ecclesiastical Household of the king was headed by the Grand Almoner of France (&quot;Grand aumônier de France&quot;) (created by Francis I), most often a bishop. The king&#x27;s chapel (&quot;la chapelle du roi&quot;)—which did not originally refer to a building, but to the religious entourage of the king—was in charge of the Mass and religious ceremonies (marriages, baptisms) for the sovereign and the royal family and the king&#x27;s alms and public charities.

It was headed by the Grand Almoner, who was assisted by the First Almoner, who fulfilled the duties of the Grand Almoner when the latter was unable to. Other officers of the &quot;Maison ecclésiastique&quot; included several &quot;aumôniers ordinaires&quot; (who maintained the regular service of the chapel), the &quot;prédicateur du roi&quot; (or &quot;king&#x27;s preacher&quot;), who preached in the presence of the king, and the king&#x27;s confessor.

The royal chapel also included a group of ecclesiastics and musicians for the religious services, divided into two sections: the chapel and oratory (&quot;chapelle et oratoire&quot;)—directed by the master of the Oratory (&quot;sous-maître de l&#x27;Oratoire&quot;)—which celebrated spoken Masses, and the &quot;grande chapelle&quot;—directed by the master of the chapel (&quot;maître de la chapelle&quot;)—which celebrated Masses in plainchant. In the reign of Louis XV, the musicians of the two chapels were united. Oversight was eventually transferred (in 1761) from the Ecclesiastical household to the King&#x27;s Chamber, and the position of master of the chapel was eliminated.

==The Domestic Maison du Roi==
The &quot;Maison du Roi civile&quot;, or domestic entourage of the king, was divided into a number of departments, whose number varied over the years. Under Louis XIV it consisted of 22 departments. Each department was directed by the &quot;grands officiers de la maison du roi de France&quot; (a title similar to, but not the same as, &quot;grand officier de la couronne de France&quot;). From the 16th to the 17th centuries, the &quot;Maison du Roi civile&quot; consisted of around 1000–2000 individuals.

The most important departments were the following:

=== The &quot;Bouche du roi&quot; ===
The largest of the departments, the &quot;Bouche du roi&quot; oversaw the meals of the king. It was run by the &quot;Premier Maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot;. The seven offices of the department were:
* &quot;gobelet&quot;: wine and drink, run by the Grand Bouteiller
* &quot;cuisine-bouche&quot;: cuisine
* &quot;paneterie&quot;: bakers
* &quot;échansonnerie&quot;
* &quot;cuisine-commun&quot;
* &quot;fruiterie&quot;: fruits
* &quot;fourrière&quot;
Officers included the &quot;Maître d&#x27;hôtel ordinaire&quot;, the 12 &quot;Maîtres d&#x27;hôtel servant par quartier&quot;, the &quot;Grand panetier&quot;, the &quot;Premier écuyer tranchant&quot; and the &quot;Grand échanson&quot; (three offices that had become purely honorific in the Early Modern period), and the 36 gentleman servants.

===The King&#x27;s Chamber ===
Directed by the Grand Chambrier of France or Grand Chambellan of France, this department oversaw the king&#x27;s rooms and his personal escort. After the &quot;Bouche du roi&quot;, it was the second largest. It consisted of four First Gentlemen of the chambre, the gentlemen of the chambre, the valets de chambre, the pages, the huissiers and the children of honor. Their proximity to the king made these charges particularly esteemed.

=== The &quot;Menus-Plaisirs&quot; ===
The complete name of this department was &quot;argenterie, menus plaisirs et affaires de la chambre du roi&quot; (&quot;silver, small entertainments and affairs of the king&#x27;s chamber&quot;). The &quot;Menus-Plaisirs du Roi&quot; was in charge of theater decor, costumes and props for plays, ballets and other court entertainments. It was run by an intendant.

=== The Ceremonies ===
Created in 1585 by Henry III, this service was in charge of public ceremonies such as: baptisms, marriages and royal funerals, coronations and the &quot;sacre&quot; (or anointment), royal entries into towns, royal festivals, ambassadorial receptions, États généraux, etc. It was run by the Grand maître des cérémonies, assisted by the &quot;maître&quot; and the &quot;aide&quot; of &quot;cérémonies&quot;.

=== The Royal Stables ===
Divided in 1582 into two parts:
* the &quot;Grande Écurie&quot;, run by the Grand écuyer of France, called « M. le Grand », who oversaw the transport of the king and his ceremonial entourage (heralds, men of arms, musicians, etc.)
* the &quot;Petite Écurie&quot;, run by the &quot;premier écuyer&quot;, called « M. le Premier », comprising squires, pages, foot valets, coaches, harnesses, saddles and coachmen.

=== The Venery===
This was the king&#x27;s hunting service, run by the Grand Veneur (the Master of the Hunt and Royal Game Warden), consisted of the &quot;vénerie&quot; (hunting on horseback), &quot;louveterie&quot; (wolf hunting, run by the Grand Louvetier), falcon hunting (run by the Grand Falconer) and the &quot;vautrait&quot; (boar hunting, run by the &quot;Capitaine du vautrait&quot; or &quot;Capitaine des toiles&quot;).

==Great Officers of the Royal Household==
The major offices of the royal household are sometimes listed as the &quot;grands officiers de la maison du roi de France&quot;, not to be confused with the Great Officers of the Crown of France, with which it overlaps in part. Although lists of the Great Officers vary, the following are generally considered Great Officers of the Royal Household:

Domestic household:
* Grand Maître de France (also one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France)
:* the First Maître d&#x27;hôtel (Chief Butler) - overseeing the king&#x27;s table and the &quot;bouches du roi&quot;
::* the Grand Panetier of France, overseeing bread
::* the Grand Échanson de France, overseeing wine
::* the First &quot;Écuyer tranchant&quot;, who cuts the meat of the king
:* the Grand Chambrier of France or the Grand Chambellan of France, head of the King&#x27;s chambre, (also one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France)
::*the four First gentlemen of the King&#x27;s Chamber, who oversee the King&#x27;s chambre
::*the four First Valets of the King&#x27;s Chamber, who oversee, under the direction of the first gentlemen, the King&#x27;s chambre
:* the Grand Maître de la garde-robe, who oversees the King&#x27;s wardrobe
:*the Grand Écuyer de France, the head stablemaster (also one of the Great Officers of the Crown of France)
::* the first écuyer de France, who seconds the Grand écuyer
:* the Grand Huntsman of France (&quot;Grand Veneur&quot;), who directs royal hunts, especially the stag hunt
:* the Grand Falconer of France, who directs royal hunts using birds of prey

==The Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi==
Starting in the 16th century and then from the 17th century on, the Maison du Roi was overseen by a ministry, the &quot;Département de la Maison du Roi&quot;. This ministry was directed by a secretary of state, the Secrétaire d&#x27;État à la Maison du Roi, although this oversight was purely formal, as the officers of the Maison du Roi were under the direct authority of the Grand maître de France (Chief Steward of France).

In practice, the military branch of the Maison du Roi was run by the Minister of War. The Secrétaire d&#x27;État à la Maison du Roi was, however, in charge of recruiting officers for the Maison du Roi and would receive prospective applications for posts and submit them to the king for his approval.

<text>A pontoon bridge (or ponton bridge), also known as a floating bridge, uses floats or shallow-draft boats to support a continuous deck for pedestrian and vehicle travel. The buoyancy of the supports limits the maximum load that they can carry.

Most pontoon bridges are temporary and used in wartime and civil emergencies. There are permanent pontoon bridges in civilian use that can carry highway traffic. Permanent floating bridges are useful for sheltered water crossings if it is not considered economically feasible to suspend a bridge from anchored piers. Such bridges can require a section that is elevated or can be raised or removed to allow waterborne traffic to pass.

Pontoon bridges have been in use since ancient times and have been used to great advantage in many battles throughout history, such as the Battle of Garigliano, the Battle of Oudenarde, the crossing of the Rhine during World War II, the Yom Kippur War, Operation Badr, the Iran–Iraq War&#x27;s Operation Dawn 8, and most recently, in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, after crossings over the Dnipro River had been destroyed.

==Definition==
A pontoon bridge is a collection of specialized, shallow draft boats or floats, connected together to cross a river or canal, with a track or deck attached on top. The water buoyancy supports the boats, limiting the maximum load to the total and point buoyancy of the pontoons or boats. The supporting boats or floats can be open or closed, temporary or permanent in installation, and made of rubber, metal, wood, or concrete. The decking may be temporary or permanent, and constructed out of wood, modular metal, or asphalt or concrete over a metal frame.

===Etymology===
The spelling &quot;ponton&quot; in English dates from at least 1870. The use continued in references found in U.S. patents during the 1890s. It continued to be spelled in that fashion through World War II, when temporary floating bridges were used extensively throughout the European theatre. U.S. combat engineers commonly pronounced the word &quot;ponton&quot; rather than &quot;pontoon&quot; and U.S. military manuals spelled it using a single &#x27;o&#x27;. The U.S. military differentiated between the bridge itself (&quot;ponton&quot;) and the floats used to provide buoyancy (&quot;pontoon&quot;). The original word was derived from Old French &quot;ponton&quot;, from Latin &quot;ponto&quot; (&quot;ferryboat&quot;), from &quot;pons&quot; (&quot;bridge&quot;).

==Design==
When designing a pontoon bridge, the civil engineer must take into consideration Archimedes&#x27; principle: Each pontoon can support a load equal to the mass of the water that it displaces. This load includes the mass of the bridge and the pontoon itself. If the maximum load of a bridge section is exceeded, one or more pontoons become submerged. Flexible connections have to allow for one section of the bridge to be weighted down more heavily than the other parts. The roadway across the pontoons should be relatively light, so as not to limit the carrying capacity of the pontoons.

The connection of the bridge to shore requires the design of approaches that are not too steep, protect the bank from erosion and provide for movements of the bridge during (tidal) changes of the water level.

Floating bridges were historically constructed using wood. Pontoons were formed by simply lashing several barrels together, by rafts of timbers, or by using boats. Each bridge section consisted of one or more pontoons, which were maneuvered into position and then anchored underwater or on land. The pontoons were linked together using wooden stringers called &quot;balks&quot;. The balks were covered by a series of cross planks called &quot;chesses&quot; to form the road surface, and the chesses were secured with side guard rails.

A floating bridge can be built in a series of sections, starting from an anchored point on the shore. Modern pontoon bridges usually use pre-fabricated floating structures.

Most pontoon bridges are designed for temporary use, but bridges across water bodies with a constant water level can remain in place much longer. Hobart Bridge, a long pontoon bridge built 1943 in Hobart, Tasmania was only replaced after 21 years. The fourth Galata Bridge that spans the Golden Horn in Istanbul, Turkey was built in 1912 and operated for 80 years.

Provisional and lightweight pontoon bridges are easily damaged. The bridge can be dislodged or inundated when the load limit of the bridge is exceeded. The bridge can be induced to sway or oscillate in a hazardous manner from the swell, from a storm, a flood or a fast moving load. Ice or floating objects (flotsam) can accumulate on the pontoons, increasing the drag from river current and potentially damaging the bridge. See below for floating pontoon failures and disasters.

==Historic uses==
===Ancient China===
In ancient China, the Zhou dynasty Chinese text of the &quot;Shi Jing&quot; (&quot;Book of Odes&quot;) records that King Wen of Zhou was the first to create a pontoon bridge in the 11th century BC. However, the historian Joseph Needham has pointed out that in all likely scenarios, the temporary pontoon bridge was invented during the 9th or 8th century BC in China, as this part was perhaps a later addition to the book (considering how the book had been edited up until the Han dynasty, 202 BC – 220 AD). Although earlier temporary pontoon bridges had been made in China, the first secure and permanent ones (and linked with iron chains) in China came first during the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC). The later Song dynasty (960–1279 AD) Chinese statesman Cao Cheng once wrote of early pontoon bridges in China (spelling of Chinese in Wade-Giles format):

During the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD), the Chinese created a very large pontoon bridge that spanned the width of the Yellow River. There was also the rebellion of Gongsun Shu in 33 AD, where a large pontoon bridge with fortified posts was constructed across the Yangtze River, eventually broken through with ramming ships by official Han troops under Commander Cen Peng. During the late Eastern Han into the Three Kingdoms period, during the Battle of Chibi in 208 AD, the Prime Minister Cao Cao once linked the majority of his fleet together with iron chains, which proved to be a fatal mistake once he was thwarted with a fire attack by Sun Quan&#x27;s fleet.

The armies of Emperor Taizu of Song had a large pontoon bridge built across the Yangtze River in 974 in order to secure supply lines during the Song dynasty&#x27;s conquest of the Southern Tang.

On October 22, 1420, Ghiyasu&#x27;d-Din Naqqah, the official diarist of the embassy sent by the Timurid ruler of Persia, Mirza Shahrukh (r. 1404–1447), to the Ming dynasty of China during the reign of the Yongle Emperor (r. 1402–1424), recorded his sight and travel over a large floating pontoon bridge at Lanzhou (constructed earlier in 1372) as he crossed the Yellow River on this day. He wrote that it was:
===Greco-Roman era===

The Greek writer Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot;, records several pontoon bridges. Emperor Caligula built a bridge at Baiae in 37 AD. For Emperor Darius I The Great of Persia (522–485 BC), the Greek Mandrocles of Samos once engineered a pontoon bridge that stretched across the Bosporus, linking Asia to Europe, so that Darius could pursue the fleeing Scythians as well as move his army into position in the Balkans to overwhelm Macedon. Other spectacular pontoon bridges were Xerxes&#x27; Pontoon Bridges across the Hellespont by Xerxes I in 480 BC to transport his huge army into Europe:

According to John Hale&#x27;s &quot;Lords of the Sea&quot;, to celebrate the onset of the Sicilian Expedition (415 - 413 B.C.), the Athenian general, Nicias, paid builders to engineer an extraordinary pontoon bridge composed of gilded and tapestried ships for a festival that drew Athenians and Ionians across the sea to the sanctuary of Apollo on Delos. On the occasion when Nicias was a sponsor, young Athenians paraded across the boats, singing as they walked, to give the armada a spectacular farewell. 
The late Roman writer Vegetius, in his work &quot;De Re Militari&quot;, wrote:

The emperor Caligula is said to have ridden a horse across a pontoon bridge stretching two miles between Baiae and Puteoli while wearing the armour of Alexander the Great to mock a soothsayer who had claimed he had &quot;no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae&quot;. Caligula&#x27;s construction of the bridge cost a massive sum of money and added to discontent with his rule.

===Middle Ages===

During the Middle Ages, pontoons were used alongside regular boats to span rivers during campaigns, or to link communities which lacked resources to build permanent bridges. The Hun army of Attila built a bridge across the Nišava during the siege of Naissus in 442 to bring heavy siege towers within range of the city. Sassanid forces crossed the Euphrates on a quickly built pontoon bridge during the siege of Kallinikos in 542. The Ostrogothic Kingdom constructed a fortified bridge across the Tiber during the siege of Rome in 545 to block Byzantine general Belisarius&#x27; relief flotillas to the city. The Avar Khaganate forced Syriac-Roman engineers to construct two pontoon bridges across the Sava during the siege of Sirmium in 580 to completely surround the city with their troops and siege works.

Emperor Heraclius crossed the Bosporus on horseback on a large pontoon bridge in 638. The army of the Umayyad Caliphate built a pontoon bridge over the Bosporus in 717 during the siege of Constantinople (717–718). The Carolingian army of Charlemagne constructed a portable pontoon bridge of anchored boats bound together and used it to cross the Danube during campaigns against the Avar Khaganate in the 790s. Charlemagne&#x27;s army built two fortified pontoon bridges across the Elbe in 789 during a campaign against the Slavic Veleti. The German army of Otto the Great employed three pontoon bridges, made from pre-fabricated materials, to rapidly cross the Recknitz river at the Battle on the Raxa in 955 and win decisively against the Slavic Obotrites. Tenth-Century German Ottonian capitularies demanded that royal fiscal estates maintain watertight, river-fordable wagons for purposes of war.

The Danish Army of Cnut the Great completed a pontoon bridge across the Helge River during the Battle of Helgeå in 1026. Crusader forces constructed a pontoon bridge across the Orontes to expedite resupply during the siege of Antioch in December 1097. According to the chronicles, the earliest floating bridge across the Dnieper was built in 1115. It was located near Vyshhorod, Kiev. Bohemian troops under the command of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor crossed the Adige in 1157 on a pontoon bridge built in advance by the people of Verona on orders of the German Emperor.

The French Royal Army of King Philip II of France constructed a pontoon bridge across the Seine to seize Les Andelys from the English at the siege of Château Gaillard in 1203. During the Fifth Crusade, the Crusaders built two pontoon bridges across the Nile at the siege of Damietta (1218–1219), including one supported by 38 boats. On 27 May 1234, Crusader troops crossed the river Ochtum in Germany on a pontoon bridge during the fight against the Stedingers. Imperial Mongol troops constructed a pontoon bridge at the Battle of Mohi in 1241 to outflank the Hungarian army. The French army of King Louis IX of France crossed the Charente on multiple pontoon bridges during the Battle of Taillebourg on 21 July 1242. Louis IX had a pontoon bridge built across the Nile to provide unimpeded access to troops and supplies in early March 1250 during the Seventh Crusade.

A Florentine army erected a pontoon bridge across the Arno during the siege of Pisa in 1406. The English army of John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury crossed the Oise across a pontoon bridge of portable leather vessels in 1441. Ottoman engineers built a pontoon bridge across the Golden Horn during the siege of Constantinople (1453), using over a thousand barrels. The bridge was strong enough to support carts. The Ottoman Army constructed a pontoon bridge during the siege of Rhodes (1480). Venetian pioneers built a floating bridge across the Adige at the Battle of Calliano (1487).

===Early modern period===


Before the Battle of Worcester, the final battle of the English Civil War, on 30 August 1651, Oliver Cromwell delayed the start of the battle to give time for two pontoon bridges to be constructed, one over the River Severn and the other over the River Teme, close to their confluence. This allowed Cromwell to move his troops West of the Severn during the action on 3 September 1651 and was crucial to the victory by his New Model Army.

The Spanish Army constructed a pontoon bridge at the Battle of Río Bueno in 1654. However, as the bridge broke apart it all ended in a sound defeat of the Spanish by local Mapuche-Huilliche forces.
French general Jean Lannes&#x27;s troops built a pontoon bridge to cross the Po river prior to the Battle of Montebello (1800). Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée made extensive use of pontoon bridges at the battles of Aspern-Essling and Wagram under the supervision of General Henri Gatien Bertrand. General Jean Baptiste Eblé&#x27;s engineers erected four pontoon bridges in a single night across the Dnieper during the Battle of Smolensk (1812). Working in cold water, Eblé&#x27;s Dutch engineers constructed a 100-meter-long pontoon bridge during the Battle of Berezina to allow the Grande Armée to escape to safety. During the Peninsular War the British army transported &quot;tin pontoons&quot; that were lightweight and could be quickly turned into a floating bridge.

Lt Col Charles Pasley of the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham England developed a new form of pontoon which was adopted in 1817 by the British Army. Each pontoon was split into two halves, and the two pointed ends could be connected together in locations with tidal flow. Each half was enclosed, reducing the risk of swamping, and the sections bore multiple lashing points.

The &quot;Palsey pontoon&quot; lasted until 1836 when it was replaced by the &quot;Blanshard pontoon&quot; which comprised tin cylinders 3 feet wide and 22 feet long, placed 11 feet apart, making the pontoon very buoyant. The pontoon was tested with the Palsey pontoon on the Medway.

An alternative proposed by Charles Pasley comprised two copper canoes, each 2 foot 8 inches wide and 22 foot long and coming in two sections which were fastened side by side to make a double canoe raft. Copper was used in preference to fast-corroding tin. Lashed at 10 foot centres, these were good for cavalry, infantry and light guns; lashed at 5 foot centres, heavy cannon could cross. The canoes could also be lashed together to form rafts. One cart pulled by two horse carried two half canoes and stores.

A comparison of pontoons used by each nations army shows that almost all were open boats coming in one, two or even three pieces, mainly wood, some with canvas and rubber protection. Belgium used an iron boat; the United States used cylinders split into three.

In 1862 the Union forces commanded by Major General Ambrose Burnside were stuck on the wrong side of the Rappahannock River at the Battle of Fredericksburg for lack of the arrival of the pontoon train, resulting in severe losses. The report of this disaster resulted in Britain forming and training a Pontoon Troop of Engineers.

During the American Civil War various forms of pontoon bridges were tried and discarded. Wooden pontoons and India rubber bag pontoons shaped like a torpedo proved impractical until the development of cotton-canvas covered pontoons, which required more maintenance but were lightweight and easier to work with and transport. From 1864 a lightweight design known as Cumberland Pontoons, a folding boat system, were widely used during the Atlanta Campaign to transport soldiers and artillery across rivers in the South.

In 1872 at a military review before Queen Victoria, a pontoon bridge was thrown across the River Thames at Windsor, Berkshire, where the river was wide. The bridge, comprising 15 pontoons held by 14 anchors, was completed in 22 minutes and then used to move five battalions of troops across the river. It was removed in 34 minutes the next day.

At Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, the Pile-Pontoon Railroad Bridge was constructed in 1874 over the Mississippi River to carry a railroad track connecting that city with Marquette, Iowa. Because the river level could vary by as much as 22 feet, the track was laid on an adjustable platform above the pontoons. This unique structure remained in use until the railroad was abandoned in 1961, when it was removed.

The British Blanshard Pontoon stayed in British use until the late 1870s, when it was replaced by the &quot;Blood Pontoon&quot;. The Blood Pontoon returned to the open boat system, which enabled use as boats when not needed as pontoons. Side carrying handles helped transportation. The new pontoon proved strong enough to support loaded elephants and siege guns as well as military traction engines.

===Early 20th century===

The British Blood Pontoon MkII, which took the original and cut it into two halves, was still in use with the British Army in 1924.

The First World War saw developments on &quot;trestles&quot; to form the link between a river bank and the pontoon bridge. Some infantry bridges in WW1 used any material available, including petrol cans as flotation devices.

The Kapok Assault Bridge for infantry was developed for the British Army, using kapok fibre-filled canvas float and timber foot walks. America created their own version.

Folding Boat Equipment was developed in 1928 and went through several versions until it was used in WW2 to complement the Bailey Pontoon. It had a continuous canvas hinge and could fold flat for storage and transportation. When assembled it could carry 15 men and with two boats and some additional toppings it could transport a 3-ton truck. Further upgrades during WW2 resulted in it moving to a Class 9 bridge.
==World War II==

Pontoon bridges were used extensively during World War II, mainly in the European Theater of Operations. The United States was the principal user, with Britain next.

===United States===

In the United States, combat engineers were responsible for bridge deployment and construction. These were formed principally into Engineer Combat Battalions, which had a wide range of duties beyond bridging, and specialized units, including Light Ponton Bridge Companies, Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalions, and Engineer Treadway Bridge Companies; any of these could be organically attached to infantry units or directly at the divisional, corps, or army level.

American engineers built three types of floating bridges: M1938 infantry footbridges, M1938 ponton bridges, and M1940 treadway bridges, with numerous subvariants of each. These were designed to carry troops and vehicles of varying weight, using either an inflatable pneumatic ponton or a solid aluminum-alloy ponton bridge. Both types of bridges were supported by pontons (known today as &quot;pontoons&quot;) fitted with a deck built of balk, which were square, hollow aluminum beams.

;American Light Ponton Bridge Company

An Engineer Light Ponton Company consisted of three platoons: two bridge platoons, each equipped with one unit of M3 pneumatic bridge, and a lightly equipped platoon which had one unit of footbridge and equipment for ferrying. The bridge platoons were equipped with the M3 pneumatic bridge, which was constructed of heavy inflatable pneumatic floats and could handle up to ; this was suitable for all normal infantry division loads without reinforcement, greater with.

;American Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalion
A Heavy Ponton Bridge Battalion was provided with equipage required to provide stream crossing for heavy military vehicles that could not be supported by a light ponton bridge. The Battalion had two lettered companies of two bridge platoons each. Each platoon was equipped with one unit of heavy ponton equipage. The battalion was an organic unit of army and higher echelons. The M1940 could carry up to . The M1 Treadway Bridge could support up to . The roadway, made of steel, could carry up to , while the center section made of thick plywood could carry up to . The wider, heavier tanks used the outside steel treadway while the narrower, lighter jeeps and trucks drove across the bridge with one wheel in the steel treadway and the other on the plywood.

;American Engineer Treadway Bridge Company
An Engineer Treadway Bridge Company consisted of company headquarters and two bridge platoons. It was an organic unit of the armored force, and normally was attached to an Armored Engineer Battalion. Each bridge platoon transported one unit of steel treadway bridge equipage for construction of ferries and bridges in river-crossing operations of the armored division. Stream-crossing equipment included utility powerboats, pneumatic floats, and two units of steel treadway bridge equipment, each of which allowed the engineers to build a floating bridge about in length.
;Materials and equipment

;; Pneumatic ponton

The United States Army Corps of Engineers designed a self-contained bridge transportation and erection system. The Brockway model B666 6x6 truck chassis (also built under license by Corbitt and White) was used to transport both the bridge&#x27;s steel and rubber components. A single Brockway truck could carry material for of bridge, including two pontons, two steel saddles that were attached to the pontons, and four treadway sections. Each treadway was long with high guardrails on either side of the wide track.

The truck was mounted with a hydraulic crane that was used to unload the wide steel treadways. A custom designed twin boom arm was attached to rear of the truck bed and helped unroll and place the heavy inflatable rubber pontoons upon which the bridge was laid. The wheelbase chassis included a front winch and extra-large air-brake tanks that also served to inflate the rubber pontoons before they were placed in the water.

A pneumatic float was made of rubberized fabric separated by bulkheads into 12 airtight compartments and inflated with air. The pneumatic float consisted of an outer perimeter tube, a floor, and a removable center tube. The capacity float was wide, long, deep.

;; Solid ponton

Solid aluminum-alloy pontons were used in place of pneumatic floats to support heavier bridges and loads. They were also pressed into service for lighter loads as needed.

;; Treadway

A treadway bridge was a multi-section, prefabricated floating steel bridge supported by pontoons carrying two metal tracks (or &quot;tread ways&quot;) forming a roadway. Depending on its weight class, the treadway bridge was supported either by heavy inflatable pneumatic pontons or by aluminum-alloy half-pontons. The aluminum half-pontons were long overall, wide at the gunwales, and deep except at the bow where the gunwale was raised. The gunwales were center-to-center. At freeboard, the half-ponton has a displacement of . The sides and bow of the half-ponton were gradually sloped, permitting two or more to be nested for transporting or storing.

A treadway bridge could be built of floating spans or fixed spans. An M2 treadway bridge was designed to carry artillery, heavy duty trucks, and medium tanks up to . This could be of any length, and was what was used over major river obstacles such as the Rhine and Moselle. Doctrine stated that it would take hours to place a 362-foot section of M2 treadway during daylight and hours at night. Pergrin says that in practise 50 ft/hour of treadway construction was expected, which is a little slower than the speed specified by doctrine.

By 1943, combat engineers faced the need for bridges to bear weights of 35 tons or more. To increase weight bearing capacity, they used bigger floats to add buoyancy. This overcame the capacity limitation, but the larger floats were both more difficult to transport to the crossing site and requiring more and larger trucks in the divisional and corps trains.

===Britain===
Donald Bailey invented the Bailey bridge, which was made up of modular, pre-fabricated steel trusses capable of carrying up to over spans up to . While typically constructed point-to-point over piers, they could be supported by pontoons as well.

The Bailey bridge was used for the first time in 1942. The first version put into service was a Bailey Pontoon and Raft with a single-single Bailey bay supported on two pontoons. A key feature of the Bailey Pontoon was the use of a single span from the bank to the bridge level which eliminated the need for bridge trestles.

For lighter vehicle bridges the Folding Boat Equipment could be used and the Kapok Assault Bridge was available for infantry.

An open sea type of pontoon, another British war time invention, known by their code names, the Mulberry harbours floated across the English Channel to provide harbours for the June 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy. The dock piers were code named &quot;Whale&quot;. These piers were the floating roadways that connected the &quot;Spud&quot; pier heads to the land. These pier heads or landing wharves, at which ships were unloaded each consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor the pontoon, yet allowed it to float up and down freely with the tide. &quot;Beetles&quot; were pontoons that supported the &quot;Whale&quot; piers. They were moored in position using wires attached to &quot;Kite&quot; anchors which were also designed by Allan Beckett. These anchors had a high holding power as was demonstrated in D+13 Normandy storm where the British Mulberry survived most of the storm damage whereas the American Mulberry, which only had 20% of its Kite Anchors deployed, was destroyed.

==Modern military uses==

Pontoon bridges were extensively used by both armies and civilians throughout the latter half of the 20th century.

From the Post-War period into the early 1980s the U.S. Army and its NATO and other allies employed three main types of pontoon bridge/raft. The M4 bridge featured a lightweight aluminum balk deck supported by rigid aluminum hull pontoons. The M4T6 bridge used the same aluminum balk deck of the M4, but supported instead by inflatable rubber pontoons. The Class 60 bridge consisted of a more robust steel girder and grid deck supported by inflatable rubber pontoons. All three pontoon bridge types were cumbersome to transport and deploy, and slow to assemble, encouraging the development of an easier to transport, deploy and assemble floating bridge.

===Amphibious float bridges===


Several alternatives featured a self-propelled amphibious integrated transporter, floating pontoon, bridge deck section that could be delivered and assembled in the water under its own power, linking as many units as required to bridge a gap or form a raft ferry.

An early example was the Engin de Franchissement de l’Avant EFA (mobile bridge) amphibious forward crossing apparatus conceived by French General Jean Gillois in 1955. The system consisted of a wheeled amphibious truck equipped with inflatable outboard flotation sponsons and a rotating vehicle bridge deck section. The system was developed by the West German firm Eisenwerke-Kaiserslauter (EWK) and entered production by the French-German consortium Pontesa. The EFA system was first deployed by the French Army in 1965, and subsequently by the West German , British Army, and on a very limited basis by the U.S. Army, where it was referred to as Amphibious River Crossing Equipment (ARCE). Production ended in 1973. The EFA was used in combat by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which employed former U.S. The Egyptian Army used the equipment to cross the Suez Canal in their attack on Israeli forces during the Yom Kippur War of 1973.

EWK further developed the EFA system into the M2 &quot;Alligator&quot; Amphibious Bridging Vehicle equipped with fold-out aluminum flotation pontoons, which was produced from 1967 to 1970 and sold to the West German, British and Singapore militaries. The M2 was followed by the revised M3 version, entering service in 1996 with Germany, Britain, Taiwan and Singapore. The M3 was used in combat by British Forces during the Iraq War. More recently, Turkey has developed a similar system in the FNSS Samur wheeled amphibious assault bridge, while the Russian PMM-2 and Chinese GZM003 armoured amphibious assault bridge ride on tracks.

A similar amphibious system, the Mobile Floating Assault Bridge-Ferry (MFAB-F) was developed in the U.S. by Chrysler between 1959 and 1962. As with the French EFA, the MFAB-F consisted of an amphibious truck with a rotating bridge deck section, but there were no outboard flotation sponsons. The MFAB-F was first deployed by the U.S. Army in 1964 and later by Belgium. An improved version was produced by FMC from 1970 to 1976. The MFAB-F remained in service into the early 1980s before being replaced by a simpler continuous pontoon or &quot;ribbon bridge&quot; system.

===Ribbon float bridges===
In the early Cold War period the Soviet Red Army began development of a new kind of continuous pontoon bridge made up of short folding sections or bays that could be transported and deployed rapidly, automatically unfold in the water, and quickly be assembled into a floating bridge of variable length. Known as the PMP Folding Float Bridge, it was first deployed in 1962 and subsequently adopted by Warsaw Pact countries and other states employing Soviet military equipment. The PMP proved its viability in combat when it was used by Egyptian forces to cross the Suez Canal in 1973. Operation Badr, which opened the Yom Kippur War between Egypt and Israel, involved the erection of at least 10 pontoon bridges to cross the Canal.
Beginning in 1969 the U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Command (MERADCOM) reverse-engineered the Russian PMP design to develop the improved float bridge (IFB), later known as the standard ribbon bridge (SRB). The IFB/SRB was type classified in 1972 and first deployed in service in 1976. It was very similar to the PMP but was constructed of lightweight aluminum instead of heavier steel.

In 1977 the West German decided to adopt the SRB with some modifications and improvements, entering service in 1979 as the Faltschwimmbrücke, or Foldable Floating Bridge (FSB). Work on designing an improved version of the U.S. SRB incorporating features of the German FSB began in the 1990s, with first deployment by the U.S. Army in the early 2000s as the improved ribbon bridge (IRB).

In addition to the U.S. and Germany, the IFB/SRB/FSB/IRB has been adopted by the Armed Forces of Australia, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Korea and Sweden, among others.

===Yugoslav wars===

During the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, the Maslenica Bridge was destroyed and a short pontoon bridge was built by Croatian civilian and military authorities in July 1993 over a narrow sea outlet in the town of Maslenica, after the territory was retaken from Serbian Krajina. Between 1993 and 1995 the pontoon served as one of the two operational land links toward Dalmatia and Croat- and Bosnian Muslim-held areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina that did not go through Serb-held territory.

In 1995 the 502nd and 38th Engineer Companies of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 130th Engineer Brigade, and the 586th Engineer Company from Ft. Benning GA, operating as part of IFOR assembled a standard ribbon bridge under adverse weather conditions across the Sava River near Županja (between Croatia and Bosnia), with a total length of . It was dismantled in 1996.

===Iran–Iraq war===

Numerous pontoon bridges were constructed by the Iranians and Iraqis to cross the various rivers and marshes alongside the Iraqi border. Notable instances include one constructed over the Karkheh river to ambush Iraqi Armor during Operation Nasr, and another where they crossed certain marshes during Operation Dawn 8. They were extremely prominent due to their use in allowing for tanks and transports to cross rivers.

===Invasion of Iraq===

The United States Army&#x27;s 299th Multi-role Bridge Company, USAR deployed a standard ribbon bridge across the Euphrates river at Objective Peach near Al Musayib on the night of 3 April 2003. The 185-meter bridge was built to support retrograde operations because of the heavy-armor traffic crossing a partially destroyed adjacent highway span.

&quot;By dawn on 4 April 2003, the 299th Engineer Company had emplaced a 185-meter long Assault Float Bridge—the first time in history that a bridge of its type was built in combat.&quot; This took place during the 2003 invasion of Iraq by American and British forces. That same night, the 299th also constructed a single-story Medium Girder Bridge to patch the damage done to the highway span. The 299th was part of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division as they crossed the border into Iraq on 20 March 2003.

===Syrian civil war===

In February 2018, pro-regime fighters used a pontoon bridge to cross the Euphrates river during the Battle of Khasham.

===Eastern Ukraine offensive===

In May 2022, Ukrainian forces repelled an attempted Russian military crossing of the Donets river, west of Sievierodonetsk in Luhansk Oblast, during the Eastern Ukraine offensive. At least one Russian battalion tactical group was reportedly destroyed, as well as the pontoon bridge deployed in the crossing.

==Permanent pontoon bridges in civilian use==
This design for bridges is also used for permanent bridges designed for highway traffic, pedestrian traffic and bicycles, with sections for boats to ply the waterway being crossed. Seattle in the United States and Kelowna in British Columbia, Canada are two places with permanent pontoon bridges, William R. Bennett Bridge in British Columbia and three in Seattle: Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, and Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge; the latter of which will become the first operational floating railway bridge upon the opening of the final phase of the 2 Line in 2025. There are five pontoon bridges across the Suez Canal. Nordhordland Bridge is a combined cable-stayed and pontoon highway bridge in Norway.

==Failures and disasters==

The Saint Isaac&#x27;s Bridge across the Neva River in Saint Petersburg suffered two disasters, one natural, a gale in 1733, and then a fire in 1916.

Floating bridges can be vulnerable to inclement weather, especially strong winds. The U.S. state of Washington is home to some of the longest permanent floating bridges in the world, and two of these failed in part due to strong winds.

In 1979, the longest floating bridge crossing salt water, the Hood Canal Bridge, was subjected to winds of , gusting up to . Waves of battered the sides of the bridge, and within a few hours the western of the structure had sunk. It has since been rebuilt.

In 1990, the 1940 Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge was closed for renovations. Specifically, the sidewalks were being removed to widen the traffic lanes to the standards mandated by the Interstate Highway System. Engineers realized that jackhammers could not be employed to remove the sidewalks without risking compromising the structural integrity of the entire bridge. As such, a unique process called hydrodemolition was employed, in which powerful jets of water are used to blast away concrete, bit by bit. The water used in this process was temporarily stored in the hollow chambers in the pontoons of the bridge in order to prevent it from contaminating the lake. During a week of rain and strong winds, the watertight doors were not closed and the pontoons filled with water from the storm, in addition to the water from the hydrodemolition. The inundated bridge broke apart and sank. The bridge was rebuilt in 1993.

A minor disaster occurs if anchors or connections between the pontoon bridge segments fail. This may happen because of overloading, extreme weather or flood. The bridge disintegrates and parts of it start to float away. Many cases are known. When the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge sank, it severed the anchor cables of the bridge parallel to it. A powerful tugboat pulled on that bridge against the wind during a subsequent storm, and prevented further damage.

<text>Svyetlahorsk (, ) or Svetlogorsk (), previously known as Shatsilki until 1961, is a town in Gomel Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Svyetlahorsk District. It is situated on the Berezina River. In 2019, its population was 67,054. As of 2024, it has a population of 62,602.

&quot;Svyetlаhorsk-na-Byarezinye&quot; (Svyetlаhorsk-on-Byarezina) is also a railroad station on the Zhlobin — Kalinkavichy railway line. It has suffered radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl disaster.

==Town structure==
Svyetlahorsk is divided into two major parts: agricultural-industrial area on the east of Svyetlahorsk and the residential area on the west of Svyetlahorsk. There are no occupied residential buildings in its industrial area (apart from &quot;lechebno-trudovoy profilaktoriy&quot;, which is a type of prison of the Soviet legacy, dedicated to forced rehab of alcoholics and drug-addicts).

===Industrial area===
The industrial area&#x27;s main street is the &quot;Zavadskaja vulica&quot;. Along Zavadskaja street, five major factories are located:
* (&quot;Svyetlahorsk Chemical Fibre Plant&quot;), an artificial fibre plant, one of the main chemical plants in Belarusian chemical sector.
* The cellulose and cardboard factory, which mainly produces cardboard and cardboard packaging.
* The cellulose whitening plant, a recently built plant which produces sulfur-whitened crude cellulose from raw wood.
* (&quot;Svyetlahorsk house-building plant&quot;) which is dedicated to production of mixed metal-concrete blocs used for large-scale apartment block buildings.

Near the center of Zavadskaja street there is a turn to (Sverdlova street) the start of which is also located in industrial area. Along it there are large stretches of (kitchen gardens) and garage blocks. There are also industrial railway lines of &#x27;s cellulose and cardboard factories, crossing Sverdlova street under the bridge. At the end of the industrial area, Sverdlova street&#x27;s part is the:
* (&quot;Svyetlahorsk Mixed Metal-Concrete Plant&quot;) which mass-produces smaller metal-concrete blocks used in construction. But unlike Svyetlahorsk house-building plant, does not produce complete sections of multifloor apartment blocks, mainly the smaller blocks like metal-concrete curbstones and metal-concrete blocks used to enclose technical wells.

Near the end of Zavadskaja street, near the cellulose-whitening plant, there is a crossing with (Saveckaja street) and a few other plants are located along its starting part:
* (&quot;Svyetlahorsk vegetable greenhouses&quot;) which produces a range of vegetables for the local population: potatoes, beets, carrots, onions, etc.
* (&quot;Svyetlahorsk fish farm&quot;) which mainly produces locally bred fish for local consumption
* (&quot;Svyetlahorsk Power Plant&quot;), the 150MWt mixed-fuel (mainly gas) power plant, supplying Svyetlahorsk, and also partly Rechitsa and Zhlobin.

===Residential area===
The residential area encompasses the town of Svyetlohorsk&#x27;s main part and it is the area were all people in Svyetlahorsk live. It is mainly divided into the communal area and the private area, which a few exceptions there and in between.

====Communal living area====
Communal living area of Svyetlahorsk is the area where all utilities (electricity, water, sewerage, TV, broadband, and, most importantly, external house renovation) are all largely provided by the state-owned (&quot;Svyetac communal-living unitary enterprise&quot;). It&#x27;s a densely-populated main residential area of Svyetlahorsk, which is home to around 55,000 of its people.

Unlike the name may suggest, there are almost no true communal residential houses in the area, and this is where most multifloor apartments blocks of Svyetlahorsk are located. Most apartments are privately owned by families living in them, although in the same buildings there are a number of state-owned apartments which the state leases to people living in them.

Communal residential area at first was built along two first streets of modern Svyetlahorsk: and and that part of the communal residential area in Svielahorsk is now called (&quot;The Old Town&quot;)

From 1964 to the current time, coinciding with the start of Chemical fibre plant construction the approach to housing in Svyetlahorsk changed. Instead of building houses along expanding streets, the experimental architectural policy demanded that the rapidly-built apartment blocks were only subdivided to (microdistricts) without the internal street-based addressing in the borders of .

=====Addressing schemes=====
From 1964 on, all buildings within were getting -based addresses, e.g. 1, house 14, flat 30, if it was for flats, or 1, house 12A, if it was a kindergarten or other building not dedicated to housing.

To add to this experimental scheme, at first, were only listed by natural numbers, which led to the short addressing scheme which looked like 1-10-11, which stood for &quot; 1, house 10, flat 11&quot;. This short addressing scheme is still widely used in Svyetlahorsk hospital patients&#x27; medical records.

Later, the numbers were augmented with human-sounding names, for instance, 1 became &quot;Oktyabrski&quot;. However, the previous short scheme persists to this day, and still it is widespread to call by numbers.

To add to the complexity of addressing, not all multi-storey apartment blocks were parts of . There were de facto which had no -level subdivision (for instance the &quot;Pyatisotki&quot; district) of addresses, but street-level subdivision. From 2018 onwards, &quot;Svetoch&quot; started to implement the all-Belarusian law demanding the street-level addressing for all buildings in Belarus.

, according to implementation of the aforementioned law by &quot;Svetoch&quot; have not perished, but were left only as to signify the discrete sets of apartment blocks delimited from one another. That is how the &quot;Pyatisotki&quot;, which was previously addressed by streets and not by , became the new valid . For the like Stary Horad and Piatisotki, the older, sole street-based addressing was left in place, as the houses in them were never previously addressed by .

The normalization of addresses led to the fact that all following addresses are currently referring to the single flat in Svyetlahorsk (and all of them are correct and being used as of 2021):

whereas, &quot;Zavulak Startavy, 1&quot; is the new address for the same house that was previously called &quot;, house 48&quot;.

Despite the new street-level addressing, the post offices continue to serve -level addressed parcels, and so do the rest of administrative and commercial structures in Svyetlahorsk.

=====Current microdistricts=====
The list of microdistricts (&quot;mikrorayons&quot;) of Svyetlahorsk, as of 2021:
*&quot;Mikrarajon Stary Horad&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Staryy Gorod&quot;, previously unnumbered)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Kastrycnicki&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Oktyabrski&quot;, mikrorayon 1)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Piersamajski&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Pervomayskiy&quot;, mikrorayon 2)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Maladziozny&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Molodezhnyy&quot;, mikrorayon 3)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Jubiliejny&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Yubileynyy&quot;, mikrorayon 4)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Piatisotki&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Pyatisotki&quot;, previously unnumbered)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Sacilki&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Shatilki&quot;, mikrorayon 5)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Biarezina&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Berezina&quot;, mikrorayon 6)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Paliessie&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Polesye&quot;, mikrorayon 6A)
*&quot;Mikrarajon Paudniovy&quot; (&quot;Mikrorayon Yuzhnyy&quot;, mikrorayon 8)

=====Mikrarajon Kastrycnicki=====
Mikrarajon Kastrycnicki was the first numbered of Svyetlahorsk, largely built between 1964 and 1969, with an additional houses built on its edge during the 1989 to 1991 and some additional houses being built there to this day, albeit sporadically (the last one was built in 2012). It mostly consists of five-floor spanning several &quot;podyezds&quot; (but not less than 2 podyezds per apartment block) with, typically 60-120 apartments per block.

Houses built in 1989 - 1991 are nine-storey apartment buildings with one to five podyezds each.

 Kastrycnicki has one school, one stadium with taekwondo school, sprint running school and a gym, four kindergartens, one kindergarten for children with special needs, one boxing sportschool and an internal park.

=====Mikrarajon Piersamajski=====
Mikrarajon Piersamajski was the second numbered built in Svyetlahorsk, largely in 1967–1972. It is around the size of the Kastrycnicki , and also largely consists of . Few additional sets of nine-floor apartment blocks were built there in the late 1980s and in the 1990s. nine-storey apartment blocks built along the , contain two-floor apartments, which was a novelty for Svyetlahorsk at the time they were built.

Mikrarajon Piersamajski has two schools, four kindergartens.

Unlike Kastrycnicki, which was built from a cleaned-up construction site and later planted with mainly deciduous trees, Piersamajski was built preserving the pine forest where it was sited, so all internal yards of Piersamajski contain actual pine forest.

=====Mikrarajon Maladziozny=====
Mikrarajon Maladziozny is by far the largest in Svyetlahorsk. It has more than 90 apartment blocks and most of those apartment blocks are 9-floor houses spanning several podyezds. It was the Maladziozny, which foreseen the architectural policy change in 1976 which forbade the construction of 5-floor blocks in favour of 9-floor blocks. Maladziozny was mostly built in the 1970s and the 1980s, with the most recent houses built there in the early 2010s.

Maladziozny is the first numbered in Svyetlahorsk not completely contained within enclosing streets: Maladziozny is itself crossed by &quot;vulica Azalava&quot; and &quot;vulica Lunacarskaha&quot;.

Maladziozny has four schools, multiple kindergartens, a pediatric clinic, and a center for after-school education of children.

=====Mikrarajon Piatisotki=====
Mikrarajon Piatisotki is a small mostly built in the late 1960s to the early 1970s behind the market on Internacyajanalnaja street, which first passed through the Stary Horad, then went through the central town market. Unlike with all other previously built , Piatisotki apartment blocks largely consisted of (reduced-area single room flats), built to house the growing worker population of Svyetlahorsk around that time. Two houses, five-floor and nine-storey with full-fledged non- apartments where additionally built there later, in the late 1980s.

Piatisotki has one school, no kindergartens, Svyetlahorsk court and Svyetlahorsk military command office.

=====Mikrorajón Jubiliejny=====
Internacyajanalnaja street, before the Jubiliejny was built, spanned the Stary Horad, then it went through the town market and then to Piatisotki. In the late 1980s, architectural policy demanded to demolish the town market and to establish a new town square and town center, enclosed by two new .

Jubiliejny was one of these two and it was built on the site of the demolished town market. It completely consists of 9-floor apartment buildings with the only exception of the so-called (&quot;the 16-floor one&quot;), which has 16 floors and is a peak of architectural ensemble, foreseeing the new town square.

=====Mikrorajón Šacilki=====
Construction of the new town square demanded also that the village Šacilki, where Svyetlahorsk started, had to be mostly demolished near the new town square. But the construction, which started in the early 1990s, stopped halfway, due to Soviet Union collapse and the changed attitudes towards property and private housing, which became preferable to apartment-block living in the new post-communist era. Therefore, (microdistrict) Šacilki was never properly built. It now consists of one five-storey two-entrance house, one nine-floor residential house and two conjoined 10-storey multi-entrance residential houses overlooking the town square, including the so-called (house with a clock).

In the early 2010s, the renewed interest to construction in this was brought in by the Iranian investment to the construction of two-large malls in Šacilki, which are popularly called (Persian quarter). Malls were built, went into service, but the further plans to construct several more multifloor apartment blocks behind 
 by 2015 were never realized.

Apart from , Šacilki also hosts Svyetlahorsk Office of Prosecutor.

==Industry==
Within Svyetlahorsk there are many industrial activities and organizations, including the power plant, a chemical man-made fiber plant, a reinforced concrete industrial complex, a petroleum producing industry, a pulp and paper milk industry, butter-making factory, a bakery, and an industrial college.

Eastern Orthodoxy is by far the dominant religion in Svyetlahorsk, followed by Catholicism. There are several Protestant churches. There are three Eastern Orthodox churches, one Catholic cathedral built in 1997, a Baptist prayer house on Paryckaja street, an Evangelical church behind the sixth microdistrict and a New Apostolic church near the town&#x27;s (public baths).

Apart from mainstream Christian congregations, there is a prominent Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses community in Svyetlahorask. Earlier, in the 1990s and the early 2000s there has also been an active local Protestant community called &quot;The Light Of Truth&quot; (in ), which ceased most of its operations by the late 2000s.

<text>The belfry is a structure enclosing bells for ringing as part of a building, usually as part of a bell tower or steeple. It can also refer to the entire tower or building, particularly in continental Europe for such a tower attached to a city hall or other civic building.

A belfry encloses the bell chamber, the room in which the bells are housed; its walls are pierced by openings which allow the sound to escape. The openings may be left uncovered but are commonly filled with louvers to prevent rain and snow from entering and damaging the bells. There may be a separate room below the bell chamber to house the ringers.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;belfry&quot; comes from the Old North French or , meaning &#x27;movable wooden siege tower&#x27;. The Old French word itself is derived from Middle High German , &#x27;protecting shelter&#x27; (cf. the cognate &quot;bergfried&quot;), combining the Proto-Germanic , &#x27;to protect&#x27;, or , &#x27;mountain, high place&#x27;, with , &#x27;peace; personal security&#x27;, to create , lit. &#x27;high place of security&#x27; or &#x27;that which watches over peace&#x27;. The etymology was forgotten with time, which led to a variety of folk etymologies and spellings, with the initial meaning being lost in the process, and sometime between the late 13th and the mid-15th century the new sense of &quot;bell tower&quot; was adopted in Anglo-Latin and Middle English. This new and current meaning came as a result of the common association with &quot;bell&quot;. Merriam-Webster explains the transformation by the fact that the initial word was later used for different types of towers and protective buildings, many containing bells. People associated the belfrey with bells, and by dissimilation or by association the word was successively spelled bellfrey, belfrey, and finally belfry. In larger towns, explains Kingsley Amis, watchmen placed in towers were also on the lookout for fires. Though flags were used by the watchmen for communication, these towers usually contained an alarm bell or bells built into a bell-cot, thus Middle English speakers thought had something to do with bells: they altered it to &quot;belfry&quot;, an interesting example of the process of folk etymology.

In Medieval Latin, the variants , , and are known. Today&#x27;s Dutch &quot;belfort&quot; combines the term &quot;bell&quot; with the term &quot;stronghold&quot;. It was a watchtower that a city was permitted to build in its defence, while the Dutch term &quot;klokkenstoel&quot; (&#x27;bell-chair&#x27;) refers only to the construction of the hanging system, or the way the bell or bells are installed within the tower. The Old French or alike has become in modern French.

<text>Mount Hoverla (Ukrainian and ), at , is the highest mountain in Ukraine and part of the Ukrainian Carpathians. The mountain is located in the Eastern Beskids, in the Chornohora region. The slopes are covered with beech and spruce forests, above which there is a belt of sub-alpine meadows called &quot;polonyna&quot; in Ukrainian. The main spring of the Prut River is on the eastern slope. The name is most likely of Romanian origin and means &#x27;difficult ascent.&#x27; Some sources offer a Hungarian word for a &#x27;snow fortress&#x27; as the origin, however this claim lacks logical evidence. Hoverla is composed of sandstone.

The date of the first ascent is unknown. In the late 19th century, the mountain became a notable tourist attraction, especially among tourists from nearby cities of Galicia. In 1880 the first tourist route between the peak of Hoverla and Krasny Luh was marked by Leopold Wajgel of the Galician Tatra Society. The first tourist shelter was built the following year.

In the 20th century, the mountain increasingly gained popularity as an extreme sports site. Some routes are classified as 1A in the winter period (from late autumn to May), according to the Soviet grading system. The most popular approach to the summit starts from the &quot;tour-basa&quot; Zarosliak on the mountain&#x27;s eastern face and gains more than elevation along a steep path with few hairpin turns. There is a steeper route (marked with blue signs) and a gentler, longer one (marked with green).

<text>The Gravensteen (Dutch; ) is a medieval castle in the city of Ghent, East Flanders in Belgium. The current castle dates from 1180 and was the residence of the Counts of Flanders until 1353. It was subsequently re-purposed as a court, prison, mint, and even as a cotton factory. It was restored over 1893–1903 and is now a museum and a major landmark in the city.

==Origins==
The origins of the Gravensteen date to the reign of Arnulf I (890–965) in the County of Flanders. The site, which sat between two branches of the river Lys, was first fortified around 1000, initially in wood and later in stone. This was soon transformed into a motte-and-bailey castle which was burnt down in around 1176.

The current castle dates to 1180 and was built by Philip of Alsace (1143–1191) on the site of the older fortification. It may have been inspired by crusader castles witnessed by Philip during the Second Crusade. As well as a protective citadel, the Gravensteen was intended to intimidate the burghers of Ghent who often challenged the counts&#x27; authority. It incorporates a large central donjon, a residence and various smaller buildings. These are surrounded by a fortified, oval-shaped enceinte lined with 24 small échauguettes. It also has a sizeable moat, fed with water from the Lys.

From 1180 until 1353, the Gravensteen was the residence of the Counts of Flanders. The decision to leave was taken by Louis of Male (1330–1384) who transferred the court to the nearby Hof ten Walle.

The foot of a wolf was once nailed to the gate and provides the last known archaeozoological evidence for the wolf in Flanders.

==Subsequent history==
After ceasing to be the residence of the counts of Flanders, the castle entered a decline. It was used as a court and prison until the 18th century. From 1353 to 1491, it was the site of Ghent&#x27;s mint. Private buildings were constructed on or around the medieval remains. Ghent emerged as a major centre for textile manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, and the Gravensteen was converted into a cotton mill. It was even scheduled for demolition.

Parts of the castle were bought up gradually by the City of Ghent, which began a major restoration in a romanticising Gothic style between 1893 and 1907 under the architect Joseph De Waele. De Waele was inspired the approach of the French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc and attempted to restore the castle to its imagined appearance in the 12th century. Many details added during this period, such as the flat roofs and the windows of the eastern outbuilding, are not thought to be historically accurate.

The Gravensteen was the centrepiece of the Ghent World Fair of 1913 during which the city centre was significantly reshaped. It remains open to the public.

Students from Ghent University occupied the castle on 16 November 1949 in protest against a new tax against beer. The occupation, referred to popularly as the &quot;Battle of Gravensteen Castle&quot; (&quot;Slag om het Gravensteen&quot;), involved 138 students who seized the castle buildings, lowered the portcullis, and barricaded the castle gate. A guard on duty at the time was captured and locked in a closet. After raising banners along the castle walls and pelting passing police officers with rotten fruit, they were eventually detained and removed from the castle, though a public outcry of support led to none of the students being prosecuted for their actions. Their campaign against the beer tax was unsuccessful.

<text>Abdul Karim Telgi (29 July 1961 – 23 October 2017) was an Indian counterfeiter. He earned money by printing counterfeit stamp paper in India, with the size of the scam estimated to be around .

==Early life==
Abdul Karim&#x27;s mother was Shariefabee Ladsaab Telgi, and his father was an employee of Indian Railways. His father died while he was young. Abdul Karim paid for his education at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya Khanapur, an English medium school, by selling fruits and vegetables on trains. He later studied at Gogte College of Commerce, Belgaum. He completed his B.Com in 1984. Eventually, he moved to the Gulf, Saudi Arabia. Seven years later, he returned to India, where he began a counterfeiting career, originally focusing on fake passports. He started a business to export manpower to Saudi Arabia and opened a company, Arabian Metro Travels at New Marine Lines. He used to create several fake documents that would facilitate laborers&#x27; smooth passage at the airport even if their passport had an ECR (emigration check required) stamp or other issues that could raise red flags for immigration officials. This practice was called &quot;pushing&quot; in the parlance of manpower exporters.

==Counterfeiting charges==
Abdul Karim moved to more complex counterfeiting when he began to counterfeit stamp paper. He appointed 300 people as agents who sold the fakes to bulk purchasers, including banks, insurance companies, and stock brokerage firms. The size of the scam was estimated to be around One aspect of the scandal that caused much concern was that it required the involvement of many police officers and other government employees including Nikhil Kothari, an Assistant Police Investigator who was found to have a net worth of over , despite making a salary of only per month. Several police officers were implicated in the case. Pradip Sawant, then Deputy Commissioner of Police, Special Branch, Mumbai, was discharged but subsequently reinstated after being found innocent. Then police officer S M Mushrif, known for the book &quot;Who killed Karkare&quot; took decisive measures in this case.

On 17 January 2006, Abdul Karim and several associates were sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment. On 28 June 2007, Telgi was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 13 years for another aspect of the scandal. He was also fined . The Income Tax Department requested that Telgi&#x27;s property be confiscated to pay the fine. He had been in jail for 13 years.

==Death==
Abdul Karim was suffering from meningitis and died on 23 October 2017 at Victoria Hospital, Bengaluru. He was suffering from diabetes and hypertension for over 20 years, besides other ailments like HIV.

<doc id="380123" wikidata="Q672443" url="?curid=380123" title="The Civil War (miniseries)">
<text>The Civil War is a 1990 American television documentary miniseries created by Ken Burns about the American Civil War. It was the first broadcast to air on PBS for five consecutive nights, from September 23 to 27, 1990.

More than 39 million viewers tuned in to at least one episode, and viewership averaged more than 14 million viewers each evening, making it the most-watched program ever to air on PBS. It was awarded more than 40 major television and film honors. A companion book to the documentary was released shortly after the series aired.

The film&#x27;s production techniques were groundbreaking for the time, and spawned film techniques such as the Ken Burns effect. Its theme song, &quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot; is widely acclaimed. The series was extremely influential, and serves as the main source of knowledge about the Civil War to many Americans. However, some historians have criticized the film for not delving into the subsequent, racially contentious Reconstruction era.

The series was rebroadcast in June 1994 as a lead-up to Burns&#x27;s next series &quot;Baseball&quot;, then remastered for its 12th anniversary in 2002, although it remained in standard definition resolution. To commemorate the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary and the 150th anniversary of the end of the Civil War and Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, the film underwent a complete digital restoration to high-definition format in 2015.

==Production==
Mathew Brady&#x27;s photographs inspired Burns to make &quot;The Civil War&quot;, which (in nine episodes totaling more than 10 hours) explores the war&#x27;s military, social, and political facets through some 16,000 contemporary photographs and paintings, and excerpts from the letters and journals of persons famous and obscure.

The series&#x27; slow zooming and panning across still images was later termed the &quot;Ken Burns effect&quot;.
Burns combined these images with modern cinematography, music, narration by David McCullough, anecdotes and insights from authors such as Shelby Foote, historians Barbara J. Fields, Ed Bearss, and Stephen B. Oates; and actors reading contemporary quotes from historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant, Walt Whitman, Stonewall Jackson, and Frederick Douglass, as well as diaries by Mary Boykin Chesnut, Samuel R. Watkins, Elisha Hunt Rhodes and George Templeton Strong and commentary from James W. Symington. A large cast of actors voiced correspondence, memoirs, news articles, and stood in for historical figures from the Civil War.

Burns also interviewed Daisy Turner, then a 104-year-old daughter of an ex-slave, whose poetry features prominently in the series. Turner died in February 1988, a full two-and-a-half years before the series aired.

Production ran five years. The film was co-produced by Ken&#x27;s brother Ric Burns, written by Geoffrey C. Ward and Ric Burns with Ken Burns, and edited by Paul Barnes with cinematography by Buddy Squires. It was funded by General Motors, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, and the John D. &amp; Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.

===Music===
The theme song of the documentary is the instrumental &quot;Ashokan Farewell&quot;, which is heard twenty-five times during the film. The song was composed by Jay Ungar in 1982 and he describes it as &quot;the song coming out of &#x27;a sense of loss and longing&#x27; after the annual Ashokan Music &amp; Dance Camps ended.&quot; It is the only modern piece of music heard in the film, and subsequently became the first ever single release for the Elektra Nonesuch label, which released the series&#x27; soundtrack album. It became so closely associated with the series that people frequently and erroneously believe it was a Civil War song.

Ungar, his band Fiddle Fever and pianist Jacqueline Schwab performed this song and many of the other 19th-century songs used in the film. Schwab&#x27;s piano arrangements in particular have been acclaimed by many critics. Musicologist Alexander Klein wrote: &quot;Upon watching the full documentary, one is immediately struck by the lyricism of Schwab&#x27;s playing and, more importantly, her exceptional arranging skills. What had been originally rousing and at times bellicose songs such as the southern &quot;Bonnie Blue Flag&quot; or the northern &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; now suddenly sounded like heart-warming, lyrical melodies due to Schwab&#x27;s interpretations. The pianist not only changed the songs&#x27; original mood but also allowed herself some harmonic liberties so as to make these century-old marching tunes into piano lamentations that contemporary audiences could fully identify with&quot;.

A major piece of vocal music in the series is a version of the old spiritual &quot;We Are Climbing Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, performed a cappella by the African-American singer, scholar and activist Bernice Johnson Reagon and several other female voices. The song appears on Reagon&#x27;s album &quot;River of Life.&quot;

==Episode list==
Each episode was divided into numerous chapters or vignettes, but each generally had a primary theme or focus (i.e., a specific battle or topic). The series followed a fairly consistent chronological order of history.

==Reception and awards==
The series received more than forty major film and television awards, including two Emmy Awards, two Grammy Awards, Producer of the Year Award from the Producers Guild of America, People&#x27;s Choice Award, Peabody Award, duPont-Columbia Award, D.W. Griffith Award, and the US$50,000 Lincoln Prize, among dozens of others.

The series sparked a major renewal of interest in the Civil War. It was widely acclaimed for its skillful depiction and retelling of the Civil War events, and also for drawing huge numbers of viewers into a new awareness of the historical importance of the conflict. Before the series, the Civil War had receded in popular historical consciousness since its 1960s centennial. Following the series, there was a sharp upturn in popular books and other works about the Civil War.

Robert Brent Toplin in 1996 wrote &quot;Ken Burns&#x27;s The Civil War: Historians Respond&quot;, which included essays from critical academic historians who felt their topics of interest were not covered in enough detail and responses from Ken Burns and others involved in the series&#x27; production.

The series has been criticized for perceived historical inaccuracies, since it focuses mostly on the battles of the Civil War to the detriment of other areas. Some also believe it provides a weak or faulty explanation of the causes of the war. While academic historians concur that the war was fought to preserve slavery, Burns presented Shelby Foote&#x27;s framing of that dispute as a &quot;failure to compromise&quot;. Though Foote was a journalist and novelist rather than a trained historian, he was given more screen time than any other commentator. The fact that Burns himself was not a historian, nor were most of his production team, has similarly led to accusations that his series did not contain a thorough enough historical overview of its subject. That most of them were also white men has also been fingered for a lack of coverage of women, blacks, or Reconstruction. The series has also been criticized for propagating the Lost Cause of the Confederacy ideology. Because Burns&#x27; documentary has been so influential, and serves as the main source of knowledge about the Civil War for many Americans, some critics fear it has perpetuated this discredited view.

==Remastering==

===12th Anniversary===
The entire series was digitally remastered for re-release on September 17, 2002 in VHS and DVD by PBS Home Video and Warner Home Video. The DVD release included a short documentary on how a Spirit DataCine was used to transfer and remaster the film. The remastering was limited to producing an improved fullscreen standard-definition digital video of the film&#x27;s interpositive negatives, for broadcast and DVD. The soundtrack was also re-mastered and remixed in 5.1 Dolby Digital AC3 surround sound.

Paul Barnes, Editor &amp; Post-Production Supervisor, Florentine Films at that time commented:

Ken Burns and I decided to remaster &quot;The Civil War&quot; for several reasons. First of all, when we completed the film in 1989, we were operating under a very tight schedule and budget. As the main editor on the film, I always wanted to go back and improve the overall quality of the film. The other reason for remastering the film at this time is that the technology to color correct, print and transfer a film to video for broadcast has vastly improved, especially in the realm of digital computer technology... We also were able to eliminate a great deal of the dust and dirt that often get embedded into 16mm film when it is printed.

===25th Anniversary===
For the 150th anniversary of the end of the war, and the 25th anniversary of the series, PBS remastered the series in high definition. This work involved creating a new 4K ultra-high-definition digital master of the film&#x27;s original camera negatives and was carried out in association with the George Eastman House, where the original 16mm negatives are preserved. It aired on PBS from September 7 to 11, 2015. Blu-ray and DVD editions were released on October 13, 2015.

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack featuring songs from the miniseries, many of which were songs popular during the Civil War, has been released.

<doc id="380128" wikidata="Q887019" url="?curid=380128" title="Otto Strandman">
<text>Otto August Strandman (; – 5 February 1941) was an Estonian politician, who served as Prime Minister (1919) and State Elder of Estonia (1929–1931). 

Strandman was one of the leaders of the centre-left Estonian Labour Party, that saw its biggest support after the 1919 and 1920 elections. Strandman was a key figure in composing the radical land reform law and the 1920 Constitution. He also served as Minister of Agriculture (1918–1919), Minister of Justice (acting 1918; 1920–1921), Minister of Finance (1924), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1918, 1920–1921 and 1924) and Minister of War (1919). During his tenure Minister of Finance, having been a critic of the previous government&#x27;s policies,he pursued an anti-inflationary policy, seeing it as a method of avoiding hyperinflation and crisis. He was aiming at a &#x27;Danish&#x27; model of a modern agricultural economy rather than indsutrialization, Strandman served as the speaker of the Estonian Provincial Assembly in 1917–1918, and as speaker of the newly independent country&#x27;s parliament (&quot;Riigikogu&quot;) in 1921. He was also a diplomat, serving as the Estonian envoy in Warsaw, Poland (1927–1929), and in Paris, France (1933–1939). 

After the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Estonia and the other Baltic states in June 1940, Strandman committed suicide in February 1941, after being called to appear at the local headquarters of the NKVD.

==Early life==
Strandman was born in the village of Vandu, Undla Parish (now Kadrina Parish). His father, Hans Strandman, was a schoolteacher, and Otto was his third child.

Strandman was first educated by his father, until he began his studies at the municipal school of Rakvere in 1886, and later at Emperor Alexander State High School in Tallinn and the 5th and the 7th High School in Saint Petersburg. He graduated as an extern in 1896 after his exams in the Estonian Governorate High School of Tallinn.

After graduation, Strandman served as an official at the Tallinn Office of the State Bank of the Russian Empire until he went on to study law at the University of Tartu in 1899. In 1901 he continued his studies at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University, graduating in 1903.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
After graduating, Strandman worked as a lawyer in Narva and Tallinn. He became known for his eloquence and was elected to be a member of Tallinn city council from 1904 to 1905. As a lawyer, he defended Estonians against Baltic Germans and state officials.

Strandman was also active in Estonian national organizations and became an activist on self-government reform, where he supported national autonomy in the Baltic governorates. Strandman was among the politicians who were supposed to compose the draft of self-government reform, but in the course of the 1905 Revolution, Strandman, like many other Estonian activists, was forced to flee abroad. At the time of the revolution, he supported radical socialist political positions, but later in his life moved towards the centre-left. 

During his exile years, Strandman lived in Switzerland and other European countries. In Switzerland, Strandman and other Estonian exiles eventually did form the draft of self-government reform, but it was never implemented. Strandman returned to the Russian Empire in 1906, but he was banned from living in the Baltic governorates for three years, forcing him to live in Narva and Saint Petersburg. He returned to Estonia in 1909 and worked as an attorney, defending participants of the 1905 Revolution. He was also a keen supporter of free speech in the media. In 1917, he became a prosecutor at Tallinn District Court.

In March 1917, Strandman and some other known politicians, who were known supporters of autonomy, were chosen to compose the draft of self-government reform, that eventually created the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia. Strandman was again elected to the Tallinn City Council and, in the summer of 1917, to the Estonian Provincial Assembly, where he was part of the leftist Estonian Radical Socialist Party, led by Jüri Vilms. He served as the Chairman of the assembly between 25 October 1917 and 27 November 1918, although with periods of non-activity in between, due to the October Revolution and German occupation. After the October Revolution, Strandman led the Provincial Assembly session of , where the assembly declared itself the highest legitimate power in Estonia. After his work as the speaker of the parliament, Strandman was acknowledged for his neutrality and punctuality.

=== Leader of the centre-left ===
After Jüri Vilms was mysteriously executed in Finland in 1918, Otto Strandman took over as acting Minister of Court. He also became one of the leaders of the Estonian Radical Socialist Party, which in 1919 would merge with the Social Travaillist Party to form the centre-left Estonian Labour Party. Strandman was however arrested by Germans in the summer of 1918.

After the German occupation ended in November 1918, Strandman continued in the Provisional Government, first as Minister of Foreign Affairs and then as Minister of Agriculture, when he also served as a deputy for Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaan Poska. As Minister of Agriculture, Strandman became the key person in composing and implementing a new land reform law. Being one of the leaders of the Labour Party, he fought hard to make the land reform as radical as possible. In result, land that had belonged to Baltic German nobility was redistributed to ethnic Estonians.

His diplomatic career started in December 1918, when he was part of the delegation to Sweden as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, asking for support in the Estonian War of Independence. Eventually Sweden sent a group of volunteers to the war. To pay for his trip to Stockholm, Strandman was forced to sell his own furniture.

In the Constituent Assembly elections of 1919, the Estonian Labour Party won 30 of the 120 seats with a majority held by centre-left parties. This gave the Labour Party a chance to shape Estonian politics on a larger scale. Otto Strandman became the first Prime Minister of the country on 8 May 1919, and additionally Minister of War.

Strandman&#x27;s first cabinet was a centre-left coalition with the Estonian People&#x27;s Party and the Estonian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party. The Estonian People&#x27;s Party left the coalition in September, and Strandman&#x27;s cabinet resigned on 18 November 1919, being in office for half a year. The Estonian Labour Party&#x27;s Ants Piip then headed a one-party minority government between 26 October 1920 and 25 January 1921, where Otto Strandman served as both Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, he established diplomatic relations between Estonia and Soviet Russia, making Estonia one of the first countries to do so.

The 1920 elections made the Estonian Labour Party the biggest party in Estonia with 22 of the 100 seats in Riigikogu, the first constitutional parliament, but the centre-right parties had also gained strength. The Estonian Labour Party remained in the coalition, headed by State Elder Konstantin Päts of Farmers&#x27; Assemblies. Strandman went on to serve as the first speaker of the Riigikogu between 4 January and 18 November 1921.

Juhan Kukk headed another Estonian Labour Party cabinet in 1922–1923, but without Strandman. In the following cabinet of Christian Democrat Friedrich Karl Akel, he returned as Minister of Foreign Affairs between 26 and 14 March May 1924 and then Minister of Finance until 16 December 1924.

=== Economic policies ===
Strandman figured several times in financial affairs. On 7 and 19 December 1923, he accused long-term inflationist Minister of Finance Georg Vestel in the parliament for incorrect spending of the state treasury. It was Strandman&#x27;s criticism that eventually led to the fall of Konstantin Päts&#x27;s cabinet and caused him to stay away from power from 1924 to 1931.

After the Estonian War of Independence, a large number of new businesses were started in a short time period and the industry was developed on loans, something which eventually led to financial difficulties. As Minister of Finance, Strandman proposed a plan for economic redevelopment that was supposed to reduce loans, lower the state budget and achieve a trade surplus by raising customs duties. At first, his actions saw little effect and he was criticised from both left- and right-wing parties, but eventually the Estonian mark stabilized, integrating the Estonian economy more with Europe. He also supported building the economy on agriculture rather than transit between Russia and Europe, regarding Denmark as a model agricultural country. In the media, his policies were mockingly called UMP (Uus majanduspoliitika&quot; – &quot;New Economic Policy&quot; (&quot;nep&quot;)) and KUMP (Kõige uuem majanduspoliitika&quot; – &quot;Newest Economic Policy&quot;) after the economic policy in the Soviet Union at the time. In May 1924, Strandman didn&#x27;t blame his predecessor Georg Vestel for deliberately creating hyperinflation, only for sheer optimism about his policies.

For almost five years, Strandman didn&#x27;t hold any important offices. He remained active in parliamentary politics and became known for his eloquence. As leader of the centre-left, his work continued to have a great effect on the economy, since he achieved for same kind of policies as he had implemented during his term as Minister of Finance. Economic historian Jaak Valge has argued that it was thanks to Strandman&#x27;s rapid and decisive work that Estonia was able to avoid hyperinflation in the early 1920s. It was Strandman who made the suggestion to name the new Estonian currency the &quot;kroon&quot;, after the currencies of the Scandinavian countries.

=== Late political career ===
As the Estonian Labour Party slowly turned from leftist to centrist, its popularity fell, leaving its highlights to the 1919 Constituent Assembly and 1920 Riigikogu elections. The party achieved only 12 of the 100 seats in 1923 elections, 13 in 1926 and 10 in 1929, until it finally merged with other centrist parties to form the National Centre Party in 1932.

During a governmental crisis in July 1926, the speaker of the Riigikogu Karl August Einbund gave Strandman the task to form a cabinet. His economic programme still consisted of lowering the budget and reducing loans, something which was unacceptable to the right-wing Settlers&#x27; Party and Farmers&#x27; Assemblies.

From 1927 to 1929, Strandman served as Estonian envoy to Poland, with additional accreditation to Czechoslovakia and Romania, residing in Warsaw. In June 1929, he unexpectedly resigned and returned to Estonian politics to head his second cabinet, starting from 9 July 1929. It was a coalition between his Labour Party, People&#x27;s Party, Christian People&#x27;s Party, Farmers&#x27; Assemblies and the Settlers&#x27; Party, combining almost all political parties from the centre-left to right. Before taking office, he criticized the parliament for becoming a &quot;factory of inadequate laws&quot;. His cabinet remained in office until 12 February 1931. It is however ironic, that the Great Depression reached Estonia when the head of government was Strandman, who had always supported cautious economic and financial policies. It was thanks to his strong skills in economics and finance that the coalition lasted for a relatively long time, 1 year and 7 months.

During his time in office, he made a state visit to Poland in February 1930, where he met both President Ignacy Mościcki and Marshal Józef Piłsudski to propose the formation of a Baltic Entente, something which however didn&#x27;t find Polish support. On his return home, he visited Vilnius, which was controlled by Poland at the time. The visit damaged the relations between Estonia and Lithuania, with Dovas Zaunius, Lithuania&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, protesting the visit as a breach of neutrality in the Vilnius disputeBy 1931, Estonian-Lithuanian relations had somewhat healed. In August 1930, Strandman hosted President Mościcki in Estonia.

Membership in the parliament:
* 1917–1919 Estonian Provincial Assembly (Maapäev)
* 1919–1920 Estonian Constituent Assembly (Asutav kogu)
* 1920–1923 I Riigikogu
* 1923–1926 II Riigikogu
* 1926–1927 III Riigikogu
* 1929–1932 IV Riigikogu
* 1932 V Riigikogu

=== Later diplomatic career and death ===

From 1933 to 1939 Strandman was envoy of Estonia to France, Belgium, Spain and the Holy See, residing in Paris. In 1936 he supported Juhan Kukk, Ants Piip, Jaan Teemant, and Jaan Tõnisson, who signed a memorandum addressed to Prime Minister in duties of the State Elder Konstantin Päts, demanding civil freedoms and an end to his authoritarian rule. In 1938, Strandman became a judge at the Permanent Court of International Justice in The Hague.

In 1939, Strandman returned to Estonia, but retired from public life due to ill health. As he was not active in politics, he was initially left alone after the Soviet occupation in 1940. In 1941 however, Strandman received a formal notice to appear at the local headquarters of the NKVD. Realizing his fate, he shot himself to death in his home in Kadrina on 5 February 1941. He was buried in Tallinn&#x27;s Sisekalmistu Cemetery.

==Cultural activities==
Strandman was on the board of the Estonia Society and Tallinn Savings and Loans Society (&quot;Tallinna Vastastikune Krediitühisus&quot;). He was a member of the Estonian Students&#x27; Society since 1899, and received honorary doctorates from the University of Tartu in 1928 and Warsaw University in 1930. Strandman renounced all honours and awards that had been given to him.

==Personal life==
In 1907, Strandman married Lydia Hindrikson (1889–1934). They had three children; their daughter Hella (1909–1913) and son Hans (1911–1913) both died at an early age, with only the second daughter, Lydia (1914–1966), surviving into adulthood.

<text>Franz von Suppé, born Francesco Ezechiele Ermenegildo de Suppé (18 April 181921 May 1895) was an Austrian composer of light operas and other theatre music. He came from the Kingdom of Dalmatia, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now part of Croatia). A composer and conductor of the Romantic period, he is notable for his four dozen operettas, including the first operetta to a German libretto. Some of them remain in the repertory, particularly in German-speaking countries, and he composed a substantial quantity of church music, but he is now chiefly known for his overtures, which remain popular in the concert hall and on record. Among the best-known are &quot;Poet and Peasant&quot;, &quot;Light Cavalry&quot;, &quot;Morning, Noon, and Night in Vienna&quot; and .

==Life and career==
Suppé&#x27;s parents named him Francesco Ezechiele Ermenegildo when he was born on 18 April 1819 in Spalato, now Split, Dalmatia, Croatia. His father – like his father before him – was a civil servant in the service of the Austrian Empire. Suppé&#x27;s mother was Viennese by birth.

The facts of Suppé&#x27;s early years are disputed. Both during his lifetime and after his death various unfounded statements circulated about his background. The first edition of &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; (1884) incorrectly states that the Suppés were of Belgian descent, that Suppé was born in 1820 on board ship at Spalato, and that his full name was Francesco Ezechiele Ermenegildo Cavaliere Suppe Demelli. Other incorrect information is given in a 1905 biography of Suppé by Otto Keller, husband of one of the composer&#x27;s granddaughters, based on the unreliable recollections of Suppé&#x27;s widow.

Suppé spent his childhood in Zara, now Zadar, where he had his first music lessons and began to compose at an early age. As a boy he had encouragement in music from a local bandmaster and the Zara cathedral choirmaster. As a teenager in Zara, Suppé studied flute and harmony. According to some accounts his father wanted him to be a lawyer, and sent him to study in Padua, from where he supposedly visited Milan and met Rossini, Donizetti and Verdi and attended performances of their operas. By another account he studied philosophy in Padua and studied law later in Vienna.

After Suppé&#x27;s father died in 1835 the family moved to Vienna, where Suppé studied music under Ignaz von Seyfried, a pupil of Mozart. Suppé played the flute in various orchestras and taught Italian. (His mother tongue was Italian, and although he learned to speak German fluently he did so with what one journalist called &quot;a decided Italian accent&quot;.) In 1837 and 1841 he wrote two operas, neither of which was performed but both of which may have been influenced by Donizetti, allegedly a distant relation of the Suppés.
From 1840 Suppé worked as a composer and conductor for Franz Pokorny, the director of several theatres in Vienna, Pressburg (now Bratislava), Ödenburg (now Sopron) and Baden bei Wien. In &quot;Operetta: A Theatrical History&quot; (1983), Richard Traubner writes that 24 November 1860 is considered by many to be &quot;the birthdate of the true Viennese operetta&quot;, with the production of Suppé’s (The Boarding School) at the Theater an der Wien. Pokorny’s son, Alois, who ran the theatre, did not have enough money to buy the rights for the first Viennese productions of Offenbach&#x27;s operas, and he presented instead &quot;Das Pensionat&quot;, which had, by the standards of the time, an excellent run: it was played for 20 nights in succession, and 34 times in all during the six months it remained in the repertoire. &quot;Das Pensionat&quot; was the first operetta composed to an original German text, and the first Viennese operetta to be heard abroad: there were productions in Germany and Hungary, and in November 1861 it was given (in German) at the Stadt Theater, New York. Suppé was heavily influenced by Offenbach; he studied Offenbach&#x27;s works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model. The operetta specialist Richard Traubner writes that Suppé&#x27;s early works frankly imitated Offenbach&#x27;s. &quot;Das Pensionat&quot; not only emulates Offenbach, but refers to him in the first act, when the heroine, the schoolgirl Sophie, and her friends learn about the can-can and proceed to dance it.

Suppé&#x27;s most enduring one-act success, (The Beautiful Galatea), dates from 1865. It was modelled, Traubner comments, in both title and style, on Offenbach’s which had been a great success in Vienna earlier that year. It has had frequent revivals throughout German-speaking countries, and was played in German and in English translation in both New York and London. A full-length operatic success eluded Suppé for some years, and it was not until after the triumph of Johann Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; in 1874 that he caught up. His &quot;Fatinitza&quot; (1876) was a critical and box office success, not only in Vienna but in London and Paris, though less so in New York, where it coincided with and was somewhat eclipsed by the first production there of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. Suppé surpassed the success of &quot;Fatinitza&quot; in 1879 with &quot;Boccaccio&quot; and had his final lasting success in 1880 with &quot;Donna Juanita&quot;. Traubner writes, &quot;nothing after &quot;Donna Juanita&quot; has endured, though several were very popular in their time&quot;: &quot;Der Gascogner&quot; (Theater an der Wien, 22 March 1881) was an outright failure, but &quot;Die Afrikareise&quot; (A Trip to Africa, Theater an der Wien, 17 March 1883) ran for a month, and received several productions, including an American revival with Lillian Russell in the lead, which ran for five weeks in 1887.

Suppé wrote music for over a hundred productions at the Theater in der Josefstadt as well as the Carltheater in Leopoldstadt, at the Theater an der Wien. He also worked on some landmark opera productions, such as the 1846 production of Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot; with Jenny Lind.
Suppé was twice married: first to Therese Merville, and after her death in 1865 to Sofie Strasser. He died in Vienna on 21 May 1895, at the age of 76.

==Works==
Suppé composed about 30 operettas and 180 farces, ballets, and other stage works. Although some of the overtures remain popular the bulk of his operettas have sunk into obscurity. Exceptions include &quot;Boccaccio&quot;, &quot;Die schöne Galathée&quot; and &quot;Fatinitza&quot;; Peter Branscombe, writing in &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, characterises Suppé&#x27;s song &quot;&quot; as &quot;Austria&#x27;s second national song&quot;.

Suppé retained links with his native Dalmatia, occasionally visiting Split (Spalato), Zadar (Zara), and Šibenik. Some of his works are linked with the region, in particular his operetta &quot;Des Matrosen Heimkehr&quot;, the action of which takes place in Hvar. After retiring from conducting, Suppé continued to write stage works, but increasingly shifted his interest to sacred music. He wrote a Requiem for Pokorny in 1855; an oratorio, &quot;Extremum Judicium&quot;; three masses, among them the ; songs; symphonies; and concert overtures. When the Requiem Mass was published in 1997, a reviewer found that it reveals Suppé&#x27;s admiration for Mozart&#x27;s Requiem, &quot;from the choice of tonality (D minor), movement layout, and melodic figuration&quot; to a direct quote in the &quot;Mors stupebit&quot; section of Suppé&#x27;s work from the &quot;Tuba mirum&quot; from Mozart&quot;s &quot;Lacrimosa&quot;. The work was revived for a first performance in modern times by BBC Radio 3, broadcast on 5 July 1984. After Suppé&#x27;s death thirty unpublished songs were found in his papers, as well as the nearly completed score of another mass.

The musicologist Robert Letellier writes that Suppé was a master of three styles, the Italian (), the French () and the German: &quot;He knew how to blend them irresistibly, assisted in the instrumentation by his rich experience as a theatre orchestra conductor, and with a sure symphonic technique deriving from his classical training.&quot; Letellier comments that Suppé&#x27;s overtures were a major feature of his operatic works: &quot;some attaining immense popularity, and securing him an enduring fame in the concert hall ... &quot;Poet and Peasant&quot; and &quot;Light Cavalry&quot; are among the most famous overtures ever written&quot;. To these, the music critic Andrew Lamb adds as outstanding among Suppé&#x27;s overtures those to (Morning, Noon, and Night in Vienna, 1844), (Queen of Spades, 1862), (Jolly Students, 1863), and (Bandits&#x27; Pranks, 1867).
===Recordings===
There are many sets of Suppé overtures on disc, but few of his stage works. A complete recording of &quot;Die schöne Galatée&quot; conducted by Bruno Weil was issued in 2005, the Lehár Festival in Bad Ischl staged and recorded &quot;Fatinitza&quot; in 2006, and the Janáček Philharmonic Orchestra have recorded Suppé&#x27;s incidental music for &quot;Die Reise um die Erde in 80 Tagen&quot; (Around the World in 80 Days) and &quot;Mozart&quot;. The Requiem was recorded in 1997 with soloists and the Cracow Philharmonic Chorus and Orchestra conducted by Roland Bader. &quot;The Musical Times&quot; described it as an accomplished piece and singled out the quieter passages &quot;such as the obsessive orchestral motif that backs the Liber scriptus, the lovely oboe solo at the beginning of Recordare, or the high violins irradiating the brief Sanctus&quot;.

Collections of Suppé overtures have been recorded by conductors including Sir John Barbirolli, Charles Dutoit, Neeme Järvi, Herbert von Karajan, Sir Neville Marriner, Zubin Mehta, Paul Paray and Sir Georg Solti. The most extensive recorded collection is in six volumes on the Marco Polo label, released between 1994 and 2001 with the Slovak State Philharmonic Orchestra and various conductors.

==Surname==
Most sources have spelled the name with an acute accent. Recently an alternative spelling with a grave accent has sometimes been used, on the grounds that Suppé used it when signing his name (see lead image, above); his name is written with the acute accent on his tombstone and in the baptismal registry it was written without any accent.

<text>The Dnieper ( ), also called Dnepr or Dnipro ( ), is one of the major transboundary rivers of Europe, rising in the Valdai Hills near Smolensk, Russia, before flowing through Belarus and Ukraine to the Black Sea. Approximately long, with a drainage basin of , it is the longest river of Ukraine and Belarus and the fourth-longest river in Europe, after the Volga, Danube, and Ural rivers.

In antiquity, the river was part of the Amber Road trade routes. During the Ruin in the later 17th century, the area was contested between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia, dividing what is now Ukraine into areas described by its right and left banks. During the Soviet period, the river became noted for its major hydroelectric dams and large reservoirs. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster occurred on the Pripyat River, a tributary of the Dnieper, just upstream from its confluence with the Dnieper. The Dnieper is an important navigable waterway for the economy of Ukraine and is connected by the Dnieper–Bug Canal to other waterways in Europe. During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, certain segments of the river were made part of the defensive lines between territory controlled by the Russians and the Ukrainians.

==Names==
===Dnieper===
The river is also sometimes called by the Russian name &quot;Dnepr&quot;. The initial D in Dnieper is generally silent when pronounced in English, although it may be sounded: or . It derives from , pre-revolutionary spelling .

&quot;Dnipro&quot; derives from . The English pronunciation is . The Ukrainian name has a rare form and rare dialectal . The Middle Ukrainian form attested in the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries was . The city of Dnipro is named for the river.

The name varies slightly in the local Slavic languages of the three countries through which it flows:
* , , or , 
* ; formerly spelled 
* , ; poetic ; formerly , , or older (, )
These names are all cognate, deriving from Old East Slavic (&quot;Dŭněprŭ&quot;). The origin of this name is disputed but generally derived from either Sarmatian * (&quot;Farther River&quot;) in parallel with the Dniester (&quot;Nearer River&quot;) or from Scythian * (&quot;Deep River&quot;) in reference to its lack of fords, from which was also derived the Late Antique name of the river, , as found in the Ravenna Cosmography.

===Borysthenes===
The earlier Graeco-Roman name of the river, as attested by Herodotus, was &quot;Borysthenes&quot; (; , ) and later &quot;Danapris&quot;. The name &quot;Borysthenes&quot; was derived from a Scythian name whose form was:
*either , meaning &quot;yellow place,&quot;
*or meant &quot;place of beavers.&quot;
**this name was linked to the mantle of beaver skins worn by the Iranic water goddess Arəduuī Sūrā Anāhitā, whose epithet of () was connected to the name of the daughter of the river-god Borysthenēs in Scythian mythology, the Earth-and-Water goddess Api, whose own name meant &quot;water.&quot;

Ovid used , an adjective derived from , as the river&#x27;s poetic Latin name.

===Var===
The Huns&#x27; name for the river, , was derived from Scythian , meaning &quot;Broad.&quot; This name was connected to the Graeco-Roman name of the Volga river, (; ), which was also derived from Scythian .

===Other names===
In Ukrainian it is also known poetically as or , from an old name used in Kievan Rus&#x27;. This is due to the influence of the Old East Slavic epic &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; and its modern adaptations on Ukrainian literature. This usage also lent its name to the city of Slavutych, founded in the wake of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 to house displaced workers, and to the Slavutych station of the Kyiv Metro.

In Crimean Tatar, the river is known as . In Turkish it is or , which was derived from Ochakiv.

==Geography==

The total length of the river is variously given as or , of which are within Russia, are within Belarus, and are within Ukraine. Its basin covers , of which are within Ukraine, are within Belarus.

The source of the Dnieper is the sedge bogs (Akseninsky Mokh) of the Valdai Hills in central Russia, at an elevation of . For of its length, it serves as the border between Belarus and Ukraine. Its estuary, or liman, used to be defended by the strong fortress of Ochakiv.

The southernmost point in Belarus is on the Dnieper to the south of Kamaryn in Brahin Raion.

===Tributaries===
The Dnieper has many tributaries (up to 32,000) with 89 being rivers of 100+ km. The main ones are, from its source to its mouth, with left (L) or right (R) bank indicated:

* Vyazma (L)
* Vop (R)
* Khmost (R)
* Myareya (L)
* Drut (R)
* Berezina (R)
* Sozh (L)
* Pripyat (R)
* Teteriv (R)
* Irpin (R)
* Desna (L)
* Stuhna (R)
* Trubizh (L)
* Ros (R)
* Tiasmyn (R)
* Supii (L)
* Sula (L)
* Psel (L)
* Vorskla (L)
* Oril (L)
* Samara (L)
* Konka (Kherson Oblast)
* Konka (Zaporizhzhia Oblast)
* Bilozerka (L)
* Bazavluk (R)
* Inhulets (R)
Many small direct tributaries also exist, such as, in the Kyiv area, the Syrets (right bank) in the north of the city, the historically significant Lybid (right bank) passing west of the centre, and the Borshahivka (right bank) to the south.

The water resources of the Dnieper basin compose around 80% of the total for all Ukraine.

===Rapids===
The Dnieper Rapids were part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, first mentioned in the Kyiv Chronicle. The route was probably established in the late eighth and early ninth centuries and gained significant importance from the tenth until the first third of the eleventh century. On the Dnieper the Varangians had to portage their ships round seven rapids, where they had to be on guard for Pecheneg nomads.

Along this middle flow of the Dnieper, there were 9 major rapids (although some sources cite a smaller number), obstructing almost the whole width of the river, about 30 to 40 smaller rapids, obstructing only part of the river, and about 60 islands and islets.

After the Dnieper hydroelectric station was built in 1932, they were inundated by Dnieper Reservoir.

===Canals===
There are a number of canals connected to the Dnieper:
*The Dnipro – Donbas Canal;
*The Dnipro – Kryvyi Rih Canal;
*The Kakhovka Irrigation System (including Kakhovka Canal, SE Kherson Oblast);
*The Krasnoznamianka Irrigation System (SW Kherson Oblast);
*The North Crimean Canal—will largely solve the water problem of the peninsula, especially in the arid northern and eastern Crimea;
*The Inhulets Irrigation System.

===Fauna===
The river is part of the quagga mussel&#x27;s native range. The mussel has been accidentally introduced around the world, where it has become an invasive species.

=== Delta ===

The city of Kherson lies on the northern bank, upstream of the Dnieper delta, before the Dnieper meets the Southern Bug river in the Dnieper–Bug estuary.

==Ecology==
Nowadays the Dnieper River suffers from anthropogenic influence resulting in numerous emissions of pollutants. The Dnieper is close to the Prydniprovsky Chemical Plant radioactive dumps (near Kamianske) and susceptible to leakage of its radioactive waste. The river is also close to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station (Chernobyl Exclusion Zone) which is located next to the mouth of the Pripyat River.

==Navigation==
Almost of the river is navigable (to the city of Dorogobuzh). The Dnieper is important for transportation in the economy of Ukraine. Its reservoirs have large ship locks, allowing vessels of up to access as far as the port of Kyiv, and thus are an important transportation corridor. The river is used by passenger vessels as well. Inland cruises on the rivers Danube and Dnieper have had a growing market in recent decades.

Upstream from Kyiv, the Dnieper receives the water of the Pripyat River. This navigable river connects to the Dnieper-Bug canal, the link with the Bug River. Historically, a connection with the Western European waterways was possible, but a weir without any ship lock near the town of Brest, Belarus, has interrupted this international waterway. Poor political relations between Western Europe and Belarus mean there is little likelihood of reopening this waterway in the near future. River navigation is interrupted each year by freezing and severe winter storms.

==Reservoirs and hydroelectric power==
From the mouth of the Pripyat River to the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, there are six sets of dams and hydroelectric stations, which produce 10% of Ukraine&#x27;s electricity. The Kakhovka dam was destroyed on 6 June 2023 during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the subsequent drying up of the Kakhovka Reservoir revealing the original course of the river in the area and disconnecting four canal networks known as the Great Meadow.

The first constructed was the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (or DniproHES) near Zaporizhzhia, built between 1927 and 1932 with an output of 558 MW. It was destroyed during World War II, but was rebuilt in 1948 with an output of 750 MW.

Cities and towns located on the Dnieper are listed in order from the river&#x27;s source (in Russia) to its mouth (in Ukraine):
Arheimar, a capital of the Goths, was located on the Dnieper, according to the Hervarar saga.

==In the arts==
===Literature===
The River Dnieper has been a subject of chapter X of a story by Nikolai Gogol &quot;A Terrible Vengeance&quot; (1831, published in 1832 as a part of the &quot;Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka&quot; short stories collection). It is considered as a classical example of description of the nature in Russian literature. The river was also described in the works of Taras Shevchenko.

In the adventure novel &quot;The Long Ships&quot; (also translated &quot;Red Orm&quot;), set during the Viking Age, a Scanian chieftain travels to the Dnieper Rapids to retrieve a treasure hidden there by his brother, encountering many difficulties. The novel was very popular in Sweden and is one of few to depict a Viking voyage to eastern Europe.

===Visual arts===
The River Dnieper has been a subject for artists, great and minor, over the centuries. Major artists with works based on the Dnieper are Arkhip Kuindzhi and Ivan Aivazovsky.

===Films===
The River Dnieper makes an appearance in the 1964 Hungarian drama film &quot;The Sons of the Stone-Hearted Man&quot; (based on the novel of the same name by Mór Jókai), where it appears when two characters are leaving Saint Petersburg but get attacked by wolves.

In 1983, the concert program &quot;Song of the Dnieper&quot; from the &quot;Victory Salute&quot; series was released, dedicated to the 40th anniversary of the liberation of the city of Kiev from the German fascist invaders. The program includes songs by Soviet composers, Ukrainian folk songs, and dances performed by the Song and Dance Ensemble of the Kiev Military District led by A. Pustovalov, P. Virsky Ukrainian National Folk Dance Ensemble, Kyiv Bandurist Capella, the Military Band of the Headquarters of the Kiev Military District led by A. Kuzmenko, singers Anatoliy Mokrenko, Lyudmila Zykina, Anatoliy Solovianenko, Dmytro Hnatyuk, Mykola Hnatyuk. Filming on the battlefield, streets and squares of Kiev. Scriptwriter – Victor Meerovsky. Directed by Victor Cherkasov. Operator – Alexander Platonov.

The 2018 film &quot;Volcano&quot; was filmed at the river in Beryslav, Kherson Oblast.

===Music===
In 1941, Mark Fradkin wrote &quot;Song of the Dnieper&quot; to the words of Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky.
