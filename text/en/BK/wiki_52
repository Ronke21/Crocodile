<text>In relation to the history of mathematics, the Italian school of algebraic geometry refers to mathematicians and their work in birational geometry, particularly on algebraic surfaces, centered around Rome roughly from 1885 to 1935. There were 30 to 40 leading mathematicians who made major contributions, about half of those being Italian. The leadership fell to the group in Rome of Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques and Francesco Severi, who were involved in some of the deepest discoveries, as well as setting the style.

==Algebraic surfaces==
The emphasis on algebraic surfaces—algebraic varieties of dimension two—followed on from an essentially complete geometric theory of algebraic curves (dimension 1). The position in around 1870 was that the curve theory had incorporated with Brill–Noether theory the Riemann–Roch theorem in all its refinements (via the detailed geometry of the theta-divisor).

The classification of algebraic surfaces was a bold and successful attempt to repeat the division of algebraic curves by their genus &quot;g&quot;. The division of curves corresponds to the rough classification into the three types: &quot;g&quot; = 0 (projective line); &quot;g&quot; = 1 (elliptic curve); and &quot;g&quot; &gt; 1 (Riemann surfaces with independent holomorphic differentials). In the case of surfaces, the Enriques classification was into five similar big classes, with three of those being analogues of the curve cases, and two more (elliptic fibrations, and K3 surfaces, as they would now be called) being with the case of two-dimension abelian varieties in the &#x27;middle&#x27; territory. This was an essentially sound, breakthrough set of insights, recovered in modern complex manifold language by Kunihiko Kodaira in the 1950s, and refined to include mod &quot;p&quot; phenomena by Zariski, the Shafarevich school and others by around 1960. The form of the Riemann–Roch theorem on a surface was also worked out.

==Foundational issues==
Some proofs produced by the school are not considered satisfactory because of foundational difficulties. These included frequent use of birational models in dimension three of surfaces that can have non-singular models only when embedded in higher-dimensional projective space. In order to avoid these issues, a sophisticated theory of handling a linear system of divisors was developed (in effect, a line bundle theory for hyperplane sections of putative embeddings in projective space). Many modern techniques were found, in embryonic form, and in some cases the articulation of these ideas exceeded the available technical language.

==The geometers==
According to Guerraggio &amp; Nastasi (page 9, 2005), Luigi Cremona is &quot;considered the founder of the Italian school of algebraic geometry&quot;. Later they explain that in Turin the collaboration of Enrico D&#x27;Ovidio and Corrado Segre &quot;would bring, either by their own efforts or those of their students, Italian algebraic geometry to full maturity&quot;. A one-time student of Segre, H.F. Baker wrote that Corrado Segre &quot;may probably be said to be the father of that wonderful Italian school which has achieved so much in the birational theory of algebraical loci.&quot; On this topic, Brigaglia &amp; Ciliberto (2004) say &quot;Segre had headed and maintained the school of geometry that Luigi Cremona had established in 1860.&quot; Reference to the Mathematics Genealogy Project shows that, in terms of &quot;Italian doctorates&quot;, the real productivity of the school began with Guido Castelnuovo and Federigo Enriques. 

The roll of honour of the school includes the following other Italians: Giacomo Albanese, Eugenio Bertini, Luigi Campedelli, Oscar Chisini, Michele De Franchis, Pasquale del Pezzo, Beniamino Segre, Francesco Severi, Guido Zappa (with contributions also from Gino Fano, Carlo Rosati, Giuseppe Torelli, Giuseppe Veronese).

Elsewhere it involved H. F. Baker and Patrick du Val (UK), Arthur Byron Coble (USA), Georges Humbert and Charles Émile Picard (France), Lucien Godeaux (Belgium), Hermann Schubert and Max Noether, and later Oscar Zariski (United States), Erich Kähler (Germany), H. G. Zeuthen (Denmark).

These figures were all involved in algebraic geometry, rather than the pursuit of projective geometry as synthetic geometry, which during the period under discussion was a huge (in volume terms) but secondary subject (when judged by its importance as research).

==Advent of topology==
In 1950 Henry Forder mentioned the Italian school in connection with algebraic curves.
Further development of the theory of plane curves is only fruitful when it is connected with the theory of Riemann surfaces and Abelian functions. This has been a favorite study during the last fifty years, of the Italian geometers, and they have also made contributions of great beauty to a similar theory of surfaces and of “Varieties” of higher dimensions. Herein a combination of the theory of integrals on the varieties, and of their topology, yields decisive results. The theory of curves and surfaces is thus connected with modern algebra and topology...

The new algebraic geometry that would succeed the Italian school was distinguished by the intensive use of algebraic topology. The founder of that tendency was Henri Poincaré; during the 1930s it was developed by Lefschetz, Hodge and Todd. The modern synthesis brought together their work, that of the Cartan school, and of W.L. Chow and Kunihiko Kodaira, with the traditional material.

==Collapse of the school==

In the earlier years of the Italian school under Castelnuovo, the standards of rigor were as high as most areas of mathematics. Under Enriques it gradually became acceptable to use somewhat more informal arguments instead of complete rigorous proofs, such as the &quot;principle of continuity&quot; saying that what is true up to the limit is true at the limit, a claim that had neither a rigorous proof nor even a precise statement. At first this did not matter too much, as Enriques&#x27;s intuition was so good that essentially all the results he claimed were in fact correct, and using this more informal style of argument allowed him to produce spectacular results about algebraic surfaces. 
Unfortunately, from about 1930 onwards under Severi&#x27;s leadership the standards of accuracy declined further, to the point where some of the claimed results were not just inadequately proved, but were incorrect. 
For example, in 1934 Severi claimed that the space of rational equivalence classes of cycles on an algebraic surface is finite-dimensional, but showed that this is false for surfaces of positive geometric genus, and in 1946 Severi published a paper claiming to prove that a degree-6 surface in 3-dimensional projective space has at most 52 nodes, but the Barth sextic has 65 nodes.
Severi did not accept that his arguments were inadequate, leading to some acrimonious disputes as to the status of some results.
From about 1950 to 1980 there was considerable effort to salvage as much as possible, and convert it into the rigorous algebraic style of algebraic geometry set up by Weil and Zariski. In particular in the 1960s Kodaira and Shafarevich and his students rewrote the Enriques classification of algebraic surfaces in a more rigorous style, and also extended it to all compact complex surfaces, while in the 1970s Fulton and MacPherson put the classical calculations of intersection theory on rigorous foundations.

<text>Charles Lee Tilden Regional Park, also known as Tilden Park or Tilden, [], is a regional park in the East Bay, part of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. It is between the Berkeley Hills and San Pablo Ridge. Its main entrance is near Kensington, Berkeley, and Richmond. The park is contiguous with Wildcat Canyon Regional Park.

The park is managed by the East Bay Regional Park District, created from the first land the District purchased in 1936.

Tilden Regional Park was named in honor of Charles Lee Tilden, a Bay Area attorney and businessman who served on the first Board of Directors of the East Bay Regional Park District.

==Location==

Tilden Park is largely located within unincorporated areas of Contra Costa County, while parts of the park are within the cities of Oakland and Berkeley. Its steep valleys and dense stands of timber offer a rare wilderness experience so close to the city. Its high ridges and peaks give wide views over the San Francisco Bay and inland across other preserved land to Mount Diablo.

The eastern limit of the park is approximately at the crest of the San Pablo Ridge. The western boundary nearly follows the crest of the Berkeley Hills.

Parts of the park land had previously been cleared for agricultural use. In many places, exotic trees such as eucalyptus were planted. There are also some relatively recently planted stands of giant sequoia. However, current conservation efforts are aimed at restoring native vegetation as much as possible, and significant parts of the park are covered in native coastal scrub. The East Bay Regional Parks District uses grazing as a means of vegetation reduction, with a herd of goats grazing each summer in Tilden.

AC Transit bus line 67 from the Berkeley BART station runs into the park on weekends. The bus line stops at the Tilden Nature Area/Little Farm, Lone Oak Road, Lake Anza/Merry-Go-Round, and the Brazilian Room/Botanic Garden before returning to Berkeley.

== History ==
Prior to being a public park, the lands that are now Tilden Park were ancestral lands of Ohlone Indians. Spanish explorers and Mexican ranchos drove the Ohlone off the land as ranching became the dominant activity in Wildcat Canyon. American ranchers of the late 1800s and early 1900s included the Curran family ranch and the Sweet Briar Dairy. The eucalyptus plantations within the park were planted around 1910 by Frank C. Havens&#x27; Eucalyptus, Mahogany, &amp; Land Company.

The first parkland was purchased by the East Bay Regional Park District from the East Bay Municipal Utility District on June 4, 1936. The 2,162 acres purchased included land for Tilden Park (then called Upper Wildcat Canyon), Lake Temescal and Robert Sibley Volcanic Regional Preserve (then known as &quot;Roundtop.&quot;)

Upper Wildcat Canyon was officially named &quot;Charles Lee Tilden Regional Park&quot; on July 16, 1936.

=== New Deal Era ===

At the June 4, 1936 board meeting of East Bay Regional Park District, the same meeting that authorized the land purchase, the Board appropriated $63,428 in local funds for park development. In doing so, they met their matching fund obligation in order to qualify for $1 million in federal relief funds for park development.

From 1935 to 1941 a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp, &quot;Camp Wildcat Canyon&quot; was located in what is now the Tilden Nature Area. In the six years of “Camp Wildcat Canyon”, more than 3,500 men from eighteen states passed through for enrollment terms of 6 months, with the option of extending their service. The CCC crews built much of the park&#x27;s earlier infrastructure and features including roads, trails, bridges, picnic areas, and golf course. The CCC also did work in the park related to fire and erosion prevention, insect and pest control, and geological work. In 1935, California Congressman John H. Tolan, who represented Alameda County helped get a $1.5 million dollar grant request to the Works Progress Administration (WPA) approved. The grant allowed construction on the Wildcat Canyon Road to commence, which was a 7 mile scenic road connecting Berkeley and Orinda. Works Progress Administration (WPA) crews built the Lake Anza dam and stone buildings including restrooms, the original Lake Anza beach house, and the exterior of the Brazilian Room. The WPA crews also contributed to the reforestation of Tilden Park after the eucalyptus was removed. CCC and WPA workers assisted in the replanting of redwoods in the park that were shipped down the California coast from Fort Bragg. The aesthetic of the park today is directly derived from the original work performed by the CCC and WPA. The Brazilian Room, restroom buildings, stone monuments, and stone road ditches all remain in the park today. The stone that was used to build all the structures in the park were quarried in-park near the Big Springs trailhead on South Park Drive.

=== Golden Gate International Exposition ===
The Golden Gate International Exposition, a two-year long world&#x27;s fair, held during 1939-40, was a championship cricket games were conducted in the Meadows field in northern Tilden Park. Brazilian hardwood from the Brazilian Pavilion at the World&#x27;s Fair were used extensively as the interior for Tilden Park&#x27;s Brazilian Room. The East Bay Regional Park District also purchased used trash cans and benches once the World&#x27;s Fair had closed. The event attracted a staggering seventeen million visitors from across the globe and was considered to be the first time a World Fair sought inspiration outside of Europe. Along with the championship cricket games, the exposition celebrated the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge, both of which were opened in 1937.

=== World War II ===
In 1942, at the onset of World War II, of southern Tilden Park was leased to the United States government to construct the Grizzly Peak VHF Station. Beginning in 1944, the radio site served as headquarters for the San Francisco Control Group (411th Army Air Forces Control Group) that oversaw command and control for air defense radar sites across coastal Northern California. The site was also a VHF station for Hamilton Air Force Base. While the site was named after nearby Grizzly Peak on the border of Tilden Park and Oakland, the actual antennas were located atop Vollmer Peak.

Camp Wildcat Canyon was used for convalescing soldiers during World War II.

On September 7, 1942, the Richmond Shipyards Athletic Association put on a large scale Labor Day company picnic at Tilden Park for the thousands of workers and families of the Kaiser Richmond Shipyards. The event spanned the entire park offering a golf tournament, diving contest, band concerts, and dancing in addition to picnicking and sporting events. The event went from 8am-10pm, allowing all shipyard shifts to attend the picnic. Attendance was 10,000 people, making it the largest event in Tilden Park history.

Nimitz Way, which traverses the park from north to south generally following the ridgeline of the hills, was named in 1955 in honor of Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, former U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander. Originally built as an access road for the World War II and Cold War-era anti-aircraft gun and missile batteries in the area, Nimitz Way is now closed to motor vehicles and has been redeveloped as a multi-use path. Nimitz was known to hike in the area of Inspiration Point, spreading wild flower seeds, during the time he and his wife lived in Oakland at the Claremont Hotel and later at a residence in Berkeley.

=== Post-War Era ===
In 1952, the U.S. Army opened Grizzly Peak AAA Site No. 3 at the site near Vollmer Peak as an anti-aircraft installation. Two locations had a 90mm four-gun battery. The anti-aircraft installation was decommissioned during the Cold War as a result of the opening of the Nike missile base in adjacent Wildcat Canyon Regional Park. The land was returned to the East Bay Regional Park District in 1959. The Army Camp area of the Redwood Valley Railway is the former location of the installation&#x27;s barracks and mess hall. A large concrete bunker still exists and is used as a Tilden Park maintenance facility.

The post-war period saw the addition of pony rides, model airplane field, tennis courts, trout fishing pond, Tilden Park Merry-Go-Round in 1948, and the South Gate &amp; Pacific Railway (precursor to the Redwood Valley Railway) in 1952. With these attractions joining the already existing golf course, Botanic Garden, Brazilian Room, and Lake Anza, Tilden Park became a quintessential East Bay experience for the thousands of families that flocked to the area in the years during and after World War II.

==Park features==

In addition to major areas of wilderness, the park includes several developed features, including environmental education areas, extensive botanical garden, swimming lake, golf course, model farm, miniature train, merry-go-round, and event venue.

The Environmental Education Center and the Little Farm are just south of the Tilden Nature Area. The Environmental Education Center hosts educational programs and permanent exhibits about the ecology of the area. The Little Farm is a model farm with a vegetable garden, shorthorn cattle, sheep, goats, rabbits, pigs and poultry. Visitors can feed the animals and learn about the working farm from farm staff.

Lake Anza is located in the central portion of Tilden Regional Park and is open for swimming from April to October. Water testing is done every week while the lake is open. Nearby hiking trails and picnic areas are open year-round.

The Regional Parks Botanic Garden has an extensive collection of California native plants, laid out over 10 acres, and includes many rare and endangered California flora.

The Redwood Valley Railway is a rideable miniature (15 in (381 mm) gauge) train. Established in 1952, its 1.25 mile track offers about a 12-minute ride and carries 160,000 passengers per year.

The Brazilian Room is an event venue and banquet hall of 1.728 square feet with a patio at 1,896 square feet located in the central portion of the park. Peter Bruno, a pioneer rancher originally from Italy, previously leased the land on which the Brazilian Room was constructed to raise cattle. Its name is attributed to the charity of Brazil when they contributed to the Golden Gate International Exposition. The designer of the Brazil Pavilion, Gardiner Dailey, conceptualized both the inside and outside of the building to have massive murals while the exposition was being held.

The Tilden Park Merry-Go-Round is an antique Merry-Go-Round, built in 1912, and listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

The Tilden Park Golf Course is an 18-hole public golf course. It was designed by architect William Park Bell and constructed by WPA workers. It formally opened to the public on November 11, 1937, although there were preview openings starting on November 6 up to the November 11 opening for various groups including the WPA workers, golfing professionals and local notables.

==Popular trails==

The park contains numerous trails, providing facilities for hiking, horseback riding and bicycling. While most of the trails are dog-friendly, dogs are not permitted in the Tilden Nature Area to the north of the park. Some of the main trails include:

The Tilden Nature Area is the northern, undeveloped region of the park. It is a 740-acre preserve with 10 miles of hiking trails. These trails include a climb to Wildcat Peak and a trail and wooden boardwalk around Jewel Lake.

Nimitz Way, a four-mile-long (6 km) paved trail (named after Admiral Chester W. Nimitz) that begins at Inspiration Point on the eastern edge of the park and heads north along the ridge of the hills, crossing into Wildcat Canyon Regional Park about two miles (3 km) in and ending at a peak above El Sobrante. Nimitz Way is very popular with hikers, runners and bicyclists, in part because it is paved and not very steep. From Nimitz Way there are excellent views of the San Francisco Bay to the west, EBMUD’s San Pablo &amp; Briones Reservoirs, along with Mt. Diablo to the east. Unknown to most of the folks who travel this trail, the two-mile section that is in Wildcat Canyon Regional Park was a Nike missile base which was decommissioned in the 1970s. Today there are few signs of the missile silos and military housing that used to populate these hills.

Meadows Canyon-Curran-Wildcat Canyon loop - A steady, but not steep, climb from Lone Oak Road which is just off Central Park Dr. At the top, Meadows Canyon connects with Curran trail which meanders downhill to Wildcat Gorge trail. To the left, it is a short walk to Lake Anza. To the right, the trail returns to take a right on Wildcat Gorge trail, it returns to the Lone Oak parking area. The total distance is a little under .

East Bay Skyline Ridge Trail (or Seaview Trail) - This trail provides views of San Francisco Bay to the West and Mt. Diablo to the East. It can be an out-and-back from the parking lot near the Steam Trains off of Grizzly Peak Blvd. accessed via Seaview Trail or from the opposite end off of Wildcat Canyon Road&#x27;s Quarry parking area via Seaview Trail. It is approximately end-to-end.

South Park Drive - The road that runs between Wildcat Canyon Road at the Botanic Gardens to Grizzly Peak Blvd. closes from 1 November to 31 March annually to protect the migration process for a Newt. It is available for hiking.

==Picnics and camping==
There are 13 reservable picnic areas and many non-reservable picnic areas within the park. They vary in amenities (potable water, grills, bathrooms) and in capacity (from 35 to 150 for reservable sites). In addition to the official picnic grounds, there are benches on most trails; many have excellent views of San Francisco and the Bay. Tilden Regional Park offers three group campsites: New Woodland with a capacity of 50 people and Gillespie Youth Camp and Wildcat View with a capacity of 75. Es Anderson Equestrian Camp offers equestrian camping.

<doc id="383448" wikidata="Q3679098" url="?curid=383448" title="Music of Italy">
<text>In Italy, music has traditionally been one of the cultural markers of Italian national cultures and ethnic identity and holds an important position in society and in politics. Italian music innovationin musical scale, harmony, notation, and theatreenabled the development of opera and much of modern European classical musicsuch as the symphony and concertoranges across a broad spectrum of opera and instrumental classical music and popular music drawn from both native and imported sources. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy.

Italy&#x27;s most famous composers include the Renaissance Palestrina, Monteverdi, and Gesualdo; the Baroque Scarlatti, and Vivaldi; the classical Paganini, and Rossini; and the Romantic Verdi and Puccini. Classical music has a strong hold in Italy, as evidenced by the fame of its opera houses such as La Scala, and performers such as the pianist Maurizio Pollini and tenor Luciano Pavarotti. Italy is known as the birthplace of opera. Italian opera is believed to have been founded in the 17th century.

Italian folk music is an important part of the country&#x27;s musical heritage, and spans a diverse array of regional styles, instruments and dances. Instrumental and vocal classical music is an iconic part of Italian identity, spanning experimental art music and international fusions to symphonic music and opera. Opera is integral to Italian musical culture, and has become a major segment of popular music. The Canzone Napoletana—the Neapolitan Song, and the &quot;cantautori&quot; singer-songwriter traditions are also popular domestic styles that form an important part of the Italian music industry.

Introduced in the early 1920s, jazz gained a strong foothold in Italy, and remained popular despite xenophobic policies of the Fascists. Italy was represented in the progressive rock and pop movements of the 1970s, with bands such as PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Le Orme, Goblin, and Pooh. The same period saw diversification in the cinema of Italy, and Cinecittà films included complex scores by composers including Ennio Morricone. In the 1980s, the first star to emerge from Italian hip hop was singer Jovanotti. Italian metal bands include Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse.

Italy contributed to the development of disco and electronic music, with Italo disco, known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and drum machines, one of the earliest electronic dance genres. Producers such as Giorgio Moroder, who won three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes, were influential in the development of electronic dance music. Italian pop is represented annually with the Sanremo Music Festival, which served as inspiration for the Eurovision Song Contest. Gigliola Cinquetti, Toto Cutugno, and Måneskin won Eurovision, in 1964, 1990, and 2021 respectively. Singers such as Domenico Modugno, Mina, Andrea Bocelli, Raffaella Carrà, Il Volo, Al Bano, Toto Cutugno, Nek, Umberto Tozzi, Giorgia, Grammy winner Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Tiziano Ferro, Måneskin, Mahmood, Ghali have received international acclaim.

== Characteristics ==
Italian music has been held up in high esteem in history and many pieces of Italian music are considered high art. More than other elements of Italian culture, music is generally eclectic, but unique from other nations&#x27; music. The country&#x27;s historical contributions to music are also an important part of national pride. The relatively recent history of Italy includes the development of an opera tradition that has spread throughout the world; prior to the development of Italian identity or a unified Italian state, the Italian peninsula contributed to important innovations in music including the development of musical notation and Gregorian chant.

=== Social identity ===
Italy has a strong sense of national identity through distinctive culture – a sense of an appreciation of beauty and emotionality, which is strongly evidenced in the music. Cultural, political and social issues are often also expressed through music in Italy. Allegiance to music is integrally woven into the social identity of Italians but no single style has been considered a characteristic &quot;national style&quot;. Most folk music is localized, and unique to a small region or city. Italy&#x27;s classical legacy, however, is an important point of the country&#x27;s identity, particularly opera; traditional operatic pieces remain a popular part of music and an integral component of national identity. The musical output of Italy remains characterized by &quot;great diversity and creative independence (with) a rich variety of types of expression&quot;.

With the growing industrialization that accelerated during the 20th and 21st century, Italian society gradually moved from an agricultural base to an urban and industrial center. This change weakened traditional culture in many parts of society; a similar process occurred in other European countries, but unlike them, Italy had no major initiative to preserve traditional musics. Immigration from North Africa, Asia, and other European countries led to further diversification of Italian music. Traditional music came to exist only in small pockets, especially as part of dedicated campaigns to retain local musical identities.

=== Politics ===

Music and politics have been intertwined for centuries in Italy. Just as many works of art in the Italian Renaissance were commissioned by royalty and the Catholic Church, much music was likewise composed on the basis of such commissions—incidental court music, music for coronations, for the birth of a royal heir, royal marches, and other occasions. Composers who strayed ran certain risks. Among the best known of such cases was the Neapolitan composer Domenico Cimarosa, who composed the Republican hymn for the short-lived Neapolitan Republic of 1799. When the republic fell, he was tried for treason along with other revolutionaries. Cimarosa was not executed by the restored monarchy, but he was exiled.

Music also played a role in the unification of the peninsula. During this period, some leaders attempted to use music to forge a unifying cultural identity. One example is the chorus &quot;Va, pensiero&quot; from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Nabucco&quot;. The opera is about ancient Babylon kingdom, but the chorus contains the phrase &quot;&quot;O mia Patria&quot;, ostensibly about the struggle of the Israelites confederation, but also a thinly veiled reference to the destiny of a not-yet-united Italy; the entire chorus became the unofficial anthem of the &quot;Risorgimento&quot;, the drive to unify Italy in the 19th century. Even Verdi&#x27;s name was a synonym for Italian unity because &quot;Verdi&quot; could be read as an acronym for &quot;Vittorio Emanuele Re d&#x27;Italia&quot;, &quot;Victor Emanuel King of Italy&quot;, the Savoy monarch who eventually became Victor Emanuel II, the first king of united Italy. Thus, &quot;Viva Verdi&quot;&quot; was a rallying cry for patriots and often appeared in graffiti in Milan and other cities in what was then part of Austro-Hungarian territory. Verdi had problems with censorship before the unification of Italy. His opera &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; was originally entitled &quot;Gustavo III&quot; and was presented to the San Carlo opera in Naples, the capital of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, in the late 1850s. The Neapolitan censors objected to the realistic plot about the assassination of Gustav III, King of Sweden, in the 1790s. Even after the plot was changed, the Neapolitan censors still rejected it.

Later, in the Fascist era of the 1920s and 30s, government censorship and interference with music occurred, though not on a systematic basis. Prominent examples include the notorious anti-modernist manifesto of 1932 and Mussolini&#x27;s banning of G.F. Malipiero&#x27;s opera &quot;La favola del figlio cambiato&quot; after one performance in 1934. The music media often criticized music that was perceived as either politically radical or insufficiently Italian. General print media, such as the &quot;Enciclopedia Moderna Italiana&quot;, tended to treat traditionally favored composers such as Giacomo Puccini and Pietro Mascagni with the same brevity as composers and musicians that were not as favored—modernists such as Alfredo Casella and Ferruccio Busoni; that is, encyclopedia entries of the era were mere lists of career milestones such as compositions and teaching positions held. Even the conductor Arturo Toscanini, an avowed opponent of Fascism, gets the same neutral and distant treatment with no mention at all of his &quot;anti-regime&quot; stance. Perhaps the best-known episode of music colliding with politics involves Toscanini. He had been forced out of the musical directorship at La Scala in Milan in 1929 because he refused to begin every performance with the fascist song, &quot;Giovinezza&quot;. For this insult to the regime, he was attacked and beaten on the street outside the Bologne opera after a performance in 1931. During the Fascist era, political pressure stymied the development of classical music, although censorship was not as systematic as in Nazi Germany. A series of &quot;racial laws&quot; was passed in 1938, thus denying to Jewish composers and musicians membership in professional and artistic associations. Although there was not a massive flight of Italian Jews from Italy during this period (compared to the situation in Germany) composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, an Italian Jew, was one of those who emigrated. Some non-Jewish foes of the regime also emigrated—Toscanini, for one.

More recently, in the later part of the 20th century, especially in the 1970s and beyond, music became further enmeshed in Italian politics. A roots revival stimulated interest in folk traditions, led by writers, collectors and traditional performers. The political right in Italy viewed this roots revival with disdain, as a product of the &quot;unprivileged classes&quot;. The revivalist scene thus became associated with the opposition, and became a vehicle for &quot;protest against free-market capitalism&quot;. Similarly, the avant-garde classical music scene has, since the 1970s, been associated with and promoted by the Italian Communist Party, a change that can be traced back to the 1968 student revolts and protests.

== Classical music ==

Italy has long been a center for European classical music, and by the beginning of the 20th century, Italian classical music had forged a distinct national sound that was decidedly Romantic and melodic. As typified by the operas of Verdi, it was music in which &quot;... The vocal lines always dominate the tonal complex and are never overshadowed by the instrumental accompaniments ...&quot; Italian classical music had resisted the &quot;German harmonic juggernaut&quot;—that is, the dense harmonies of Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. Italian music also had little in common with the French reaction to that German music—the impressionism of Claude Debussy, for example, in which melodic development is largely abandoned for the creation of mood and atmosphere through the sounds of individual chords.

European classical music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned much of the historical, nationally developed schools of harmony and melody in favor of experimental music, atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These changes have also made classical music less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.

===Opera===
Opera originated in Italy in the late 16th century during the time of the Florentine Camerata. Through the centuries that followed, opera traditions developed in Naples and Venice; the operas of Claudio Monteverdi, Alessandro Scarlatti, Giambattista Pergolesi, and, later, of Gioacchino Rossini, Vincenzo Bellini, and Gaetano Donizetti flourished. Opera has remained the musical form most closely linked with Italian music and Italian identity. This was most obvious in the 19th century through the works of Giuseppe Verdi, an icon of Italian culture and pan-Italian unity. Italy retained a Romantic operatic musical tradition in the early 20th century, exemplified by composers of the so-called Giovane Scuola, whose music was anchored in the previous century, including Arrigo Boito, Ruggiero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, and Francesco Cilea. Giacomo Puccini, who was a realist composer, has been described by &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica Online&quot; as the man who &quot;virtually brought the history of Italian opera to an end&quot;.

After World War I, however, opera declined in comparison to the popular heights of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Causes included the general cultural shift away from Romanticism and the rise of the cinema, which became a major source of entertainment. A third cause is the fact that &quot;internationalism&quot; had brought contemporary Italian opera to a state where it was no longer &quot;Italian&quot;. This was the opinion of at least one prominent Italian musicologist and critic, Fausto Terrefranca, who, in a 1912 pamphlet entitled &quot;Giaccomo Puccini and International Opera&quot;, accused Puccini of &quot;commercialism&quot; and of having deserted Italian traditions. Traditional Romantic opera remained popular; indeed, the dominant opera publisher in the early 20th century was Casa Ricordi, which focused almost exclusively on popular operas until the 1930s, when the company allowed more unusual composers with less mainstream appeal. The rise of relatively new publishers such as Carisch and Suvini Zerboni also helped to fuel the diversification of Italian opera. Opera remains a major part of Italian culture; renewed interest in opera across the sectors of Italian society began in the 1980s. Respected composers from this era include the well-known Aldo Clementi, and younger peers such as Marco Tutino and Lorenzo Ferrero.

===Sacred music===
Italy, being one of Catholicism&#x27;s seminal nations, has a long history of music for the Catholic Church. Until approximately 1800, it was possible to hear Gregorian Chant and Renaissance polyphony, such as the music of Palestrina, Lassus, Anerio, and others. Approximately 1800 to approximately 1900 was a century during which a more popular, operatic, and entertaining type of church music was heard, to the exclusion of the aforementioned chant and polyphony. In the late 19th century, the Cecilian Movement was started by musicians who fought to restore this music. This movement gained impetus not in Italy but in Germany, particularly in Regensburg. The movement reached its apex around 1900 with the ascent of Don Lorenzo Perosi and his supporter (and future saint), Pope Pius X. The advent of Vatican II, however, nearly obliterated all Latin-language music from the Church, once again substituting it with a more popular style.

===Instrumental music===
====Baroque and Classical====

The dominance of opera in Italian music tends to overshadow the important area of instrumental music. Historically, such music includes the vast array of sacred instrumental music, instrumental concertos, and orchestral music in the works of Andrea Gabrieli, Giovanni Gabrieli, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Tomaso Albinoni, Arcangelo Corelli, Antonio Vivaldi, Domenico Scarlatti, Luigi Boccherini, Muzio Clementi, Giuseppe Gariboldi, Luigi Cherubini, Giovanni Battista Viotti and Niccolò Paganini. (Even opera composers occasionally worked in other forms—Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s String Quartet in E minor, for example. Even Donizetti, whose name is identified with the beginnings of Italian lyric opera, wrote 18 string quartets.) In the early 20th century, instrumental music began growing in importance, a process that started around 1904 with Giuseppe Martucci&#x27;s Second Symphony, a work that Gian Francesco Malipiero called &quot;the starting point of the renaissance of non-operatic Italian music.&quot; Several early composers from this era, such as Leone Sinigaglia, used native folk traditions.

====Romantic to Modern====
The early 20th century is also marked by the presence of a group of composers called the &quot;generazione dell&#x27;ottanta&quot; (generation of 1880), including Franco Alfano, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Ildebrando Pizzetti, and Ottorino Respighi. These composers usually concentrated on writing instrumental works, rather than opera. Members of this generation were the dominant figures in Italian music after Puccini&#x27;s death in 1924. New organizations arose to promote Italian music, such as the Venice Festival of Contemporary Music and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. Guido M. Gatti&#x27;s founding of the periodical &quot;Il Pianoforte&quot; and then &quot;La rassegna musicale&quot; also helped to promote a broader view of music than the political and social climate allowed. Most Italians, however, preferred more traditional pieces and established standards, and only a small audience sought new styles of experimental classical music.
Italy is also the homeland of important interpreters, such as Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Quartetto Italiano, I Musici, Salvatore Accardo, Maurizio Pollini, Uto Ughi, Aldo Ciccolini, Severino Gazzelloni, Arturo Toscanini, Mario Brunello, Ferruccio Busoni, Claudio Abbado, Ruggero Chiesa, Bruno Canino, Carlo Maria Giulini, Oscar Ghiglia and Riccardo Muti.

===Ballet===
Italian contributions to ballet are less known and appreciated than in other areas of classical music. Italy, particularly Milan, was a center of court ballet as early as the 15th century, which was influenced by the entertainments common in royal celebrations and aristocratic weddings. Early choreographers and composers of ballet include Fabritio Caroso and Cesare Negri. The style of ballet known as the &quot;spectacles &quot;all’italiana&quot;&quot; imported to France from Italy caught on, and the first ballet performed in France (1581), &quot;Ballet Comique de la Reine&quot;, was choreographed by an Italian, Baltazarini di Belgioioso, better known by the French version of his name, Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx. Early ballet was accompanied by considerable instrumentation, with the playing of horns, trombones, kettle drums, dulcimers, bagpipes, etc. Although the music has not survived, there is speculation that dancers, themselves, may have played instruments on stage. Then, in the wake of the French Revolution, Italy again became a center of ballet, largely through the efforts of Salvatore Viganò, a choreographer who worked with some of the most prominent composers of the day. He became balletmaster at La Scala in 1812. The best-known example of Italian ballet from the 19th century is probably &quot;Excelsior&quot;, with music by Romualdo Marenco and choreography by Luigi Manzotti. It was composed in 1881 and is a lavish tribute to the scientific and industrial progress of the 19th century. It is still performed and was staged as recently as 2002.

Currently, major Italian opera theaters maintain ballet companies. They exist to provide incidental and ceremonial dancing in many operas, such as &quot;Aida&quot; or &quot;La Traviata&quot;. These dance companies usually maintain a separate ballet season and perform the standard repertoire of classical ballet, little of which is Italian. The Italian equivalent of the Russian Bolshoi Ballet and similar companies that exist only to perform ballet, independent of a parent opera theater is La Scala Theatre Ballet. In 1979, a modern dance company, Aterballetto, was founded in Reggio Emilia by Vittorio Biagi.

===Experimental music===

Experimental music is a broad, loosely defined field encompassing musics created by abandoning traditional classical concepts of melody and harmony, and by using the new technology of electronics to create hitherto impossible sounds. In Italy, one of the first to devote his attention to experimental music was Ferruccio Busoni, whose 1907 publication, &quot;Sketch for a New Aesthetic of Music&quot;, discussed the use of electrical and other new sounds in future music. He spoke of his dissatisfaction with the constraints of traditional music:

:&quot;We have divided the octave into twelve equidistant degrees…and have constructed our instruments in such as way that we can never get in above or below or between them…our ears are no longer capable of hearing anything else…yet Nature created an &quot;infinite gradation—infinite!&quot; Who still knows it nowadays?&quot;

Similarly, Luigi Russolo, the Italian Futurist painter and composer, wrote of the possibilities of new music in his 1913 manifestoes &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; and &quot;Musica Futurista&quot;. He also invented and built instruments such as the &quot;intonarumori&quot;, mostly percussion, which were used in a precursor to the style known as &quot;musique concrète&quot;. One of the most influential events in early 20th century music was the return of Alfredo Casella from France in 1915; Casella founded the Società Italiana di Musica Moderna, which promoted several composers in disparate styles, ranging from experimental to traditional. After a dispute over the value of experimental music in 1923, Casella formed the Corporazione delle Nuove Musiche to promote modern experimental music.

In the 1950s, Luciano Berio experimented with instruments accompanied by electronic sounds on tape. In modern Italy, one important organization that fosters research in avantgarde and electronic music is CEMAT, the Federation of Italian Electroacoustic Music Centers. It was founded in 1996 in Rome and is a member of the CIME, the &quot;Confédération Internationale de Musique Electroacoustique&quot;. CEMAT promotes the activities of the &quot;Sonora&quot; project, launched jointly by the Department for Performing Arts, Ministry for Cultural Affairs and the Directorate for Cultural Relations, Ministry for Foreign Affairs with the object of promoting and diffusing Italian contemporary music abroad.

===Classical music in society===
Italian classical music grew gradually more experimental and progressive into the mid-20th century, while popular tastes have tended to stick with well established composers and compositions of the past. The 2004–2005 program at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples is typical of modern Italy: of the eight operas represented, the most recent was Puccini. In symphonic music, of the 26 composers whose music was played, 21 of them were from the 19th century or earlier, composers who use the melodies and harmonies typical of the Romantic era. This focus is common to other European traditions, and is known as postmodernism, a school of thought that draws on earlier harmonic and melodic concepts that pre-date the conceptions of atonality and dissonance. This focus on popular historical composers has helped to maintain a continued presence of classical music across a broad spectrum of Italian society. When music is part of a public display or gathering, it is often chosen from a very eclectic repertoire that is as likely to include well-known classical music as popular music.

A few recent works have become a part of the modern repertoire, including scores and theatrical works by composers such as Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Franco Donatoni, and Sylvano Bussotti. These composers are not part of a distinct school or tradition, though they do share certain techniques and influences. By the 1970s, avant-garde classical music had become linked to the Italian Communist Party, while a revival of popular interest continued into the next decade, with foundations, festivals and organization created to promote modern music. Near the end of the 20th century, government sponsorship of musical institutions began to decline, and several RAI choirs and city orchestras were closed. Despite this, a number of composers gained international reputations in the early 21st century.

== Folk music ==
Italian folk music has a deep and complex history. Because national unification came late to the Italian peninsula, the traditional music of its many hundreds of cultures exhibit no homogeneous national character. Rather, each region and community possesses a unique musical tradition that reflects the history, language, and ethnic composition of that particular locale. These traditions reflect Italy&#x27;s geographic position in southern Europe and in the centre of the Mediterranean; Celtic, Slavic, Greek, and Byzantine influences, as well as rough geography and the historic dominance of small city states, have all combined to allow diverse musical styles to coexist in close proximity.

Italian folk styles are very diverse, and include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, instrumental and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison singing in two or three parts carried by a single performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a &quot;rubato&quot; tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian folk tradition, and the country&#x27;s folk music never became a national symbol.

=== Regions ===

Folk music is sometimes divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system of three regions, southern, central and northern, proposed by Alan Lomax in 1956 and often repeated. Additionally, Curt Sachs proposed the existence of two quite distinct kinds of folk music in Europe: continental and Mediterranean. Others have placed the transition zone from the former to the latter roughly in north-central Italy, approximately between Pesaro and La Spezia. The central, northern and southern parts of the peninsula each share certain musical characteristics, and are each distinct from the music of Sardinia.

In the Piedmontese valleys and some Ligurian communities of northwestern Italy, the music preserves the strong influence of ancient Occitania. The lyrics of the Occitanic troubadours are some of the oldest preserved samples of vernacular song, and modern bands like Gai Saber and Lou Dalfin preserve and contemporize Occitan music. The Occitanian culture retains characteristics of the ancient Celtic influence, through the use of six- or seven-hole flutes (&quot;fifre&quot;) or the bagpipes (&quot;piva&quot;). Much of northern Italy shares with areas of Europe further to the north an interest in ballad singing (called &quot;canto epico lirico&quot; in Italian) and choral singing. Even ballads—usually thought of as a vehicle for a solo voice—may be sung in choirs. In the province of Trento &quot;folk choirs&quot; are the most common form of music making.
Noticeable musical differences in the southern type include increased use of interval part singing and a greater variety of folk instruments. The Celtic and Slavic influences on the group and open-voice choral works of the north yield to a stronger Arabic, Greek, and North African-influenced strident monody of the south. In parts of Apulia (Grecìa Salentina, for example) the Griko dialect is commonly used in song. The Apulian city of Taranto is a home of the tarantella, a rhythmic dance widely performed in southern Italy. Apulian music in general, and Salentine music in particular, has been well researched and documented by ethnomusicologists and by Aramirè.

The music of the island of Sardinia is best known for the polyphonic chanting of the &quot;tenores&quot;. The sound of the &quot;tenores&quot; recalls the roots of Gregorian chant, and is similar to but distinctive from the Ligurian trallalero. Typical instruments include the &quot;launeddas&quot;, a Sardinian triplepipe used in a sophisticated and complex manner. Efisio Melis was a well-known master &quot;launeddas&quot; player of the 1930s.

=== Songs ===
Italian folk songs include ballads, lyrical songs, lullabies and children&#x27;s songs, seasonal songs based around holidays such as Christmas, life-cycle songs that celebrate weddings, baptisms and other important events, dance songs, cattle calls and occupational songs, tied to professions such as fishermen, shepherds and soldiers. Ballads (&quot;canti epico-lirici&quot;) and lyric songs (&quot;canti lirico-monostrofici&quot;) are two important categories. Ballads are most common in northern Italy, while lyric songs prevail further south. Ballads are closely tied to the English form, with some British ballads existing in exact correspondence with an Italian song. Other Italian ballads are more closely based on French models. Lyric songs are a diverse category that consist of lullabies, serenades and work songs, and are frequently improvised though based on a traditional repertoire.

Other Italian folk song traditions are less common than ballads and lyric songs. Strophic, religious &quot;laude&quot;, sometimes in Latin, are still occasionally performed, and epic songs are also known, especially those of the &quot;maggio&quot; celebration. Professional female singers perform dirges similar in style to those elsewhere in Europe. Yodeling exists in northern Italy, though it is most commonly associated with the folk musics of other Alpine nations. The Italian Carnival is associated with several song types, especially the Carnival of Bagolino, Brescia. Choirs and brass bands are a part of the mid-Lenten holiday, while the begging song tradition extends through many holidays throughout the year.

=== Instrumentation ===

Instrumentation is an integral part of all facets of Italian folk music. There are several instruments that retain older forms even while newer models have become widespread elsewhere in Europe. Many Italian instruments are tied to certain rituals or occasions, such as the &quot;zampogna&quot; bagpipe, typically heard only at Christmas. Italian folk instruments can be divided into string, wind and percussion categories. Common instruments include the , an accordion most closely associated with the ; the diatonic button is most common in central Italy, while chromatic accordions prevail in the north. Many municipalities are home to brass bands, which perform with roots revival groups; these ensembles are based around the clarinet, accordion, violin and small drums, adorned with bells.

Italy&#x27;s wind instruments include most prominently a variety of folk flutes. These include duct, globular and transverse flutes, as well as various variations of the pan flute. Double flutes are most common in Campania, Calabria and Sicily. A ceramic pitcher called the is also used as a wind instrument, by blowing across an opening in the narrow bottle neck; it is found in eastern Sicily and Campania. Single- () and double-reed () pipes are commonly played in groups of two or three. Several folk bagpipes are well-known, including central Italy&#x27;s ; dialect names for the bagpipe vary throughout Italy-- in Bergamo, in Lombardy, in Alessandria, Genoa, Pavia and Piacenza, and so forth.

Numerous percussion instruments are a part of Italian folk music, including wood blocks, bells, castanets, drums. Several regions have their own distinct form of rattle, including the cog rattle and the Calabrian , a spinning or shepherd&#x27;s staff with permanently attached seed rattles with ritual fertility significance. The Neapolitan rattle is the , made out of several mallets in a wooden frame. Tambourines (, ), as are various kinds of drums, such as the friction drum . The tamburello, while appearing very similar to the contemporary western tambourine, is actually played with a much more articulate and sophisticated technique (influenced by Middle Eastern playing), giving it a wide range of sounds. The mouth-harp, or &quot;care-chaser&quot;, is a distinctive instrument, found only in northern Italy and Sicily.

String instruments vary widely depending on locality, with no nationally prominent representative. Viggiano is home to a harp tradition, which has a historical base in Abruzzi, Lazio and Calabria. 
Calabria, alone, has 30 traditional musical instruments, some of which have strongly archaic characteristics and are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy. It is home to the four- or five-stringed guitar called the , and a three-stringed, bowed fiddle called the &quot;lira&quot;, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, bowed fiddle called the , is common in the northeast of the country. The largely German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the &quot;ghironda&quot; (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.
Existing, rooted and widespread traditions confirm the production of ephemeral and toy instruments made of bark, reed (arundo donax), leaves, fibers and stems, as it emerges, for example, from Fabio Lombardi&#x27;s research.

=== Dance ===

Dance is an integral part of folk traditions in Italy. Some of the dances are ancient and, to a certain extent, persist today. There are magico-ritual dances of propitiation as well as harvest dances, including the &quot;sea-harvest&quot; dances of fishing communities in Calabria and the wine harvest dances in Tuscany. Famous dances include the southern ; perhaps the most iconic of Italian dances, the is in time, and is part of a folk ritual intended to cure the poison caused by tarantula bites. Popular Tuscan dances ritually act out the hunting of the hare, or display blades in weapon dances that simulate or recall the moves of combat, or use the weapons as stylized instruments of the dance itself. For example, in a few villages in northern Italy, swords are replaced by wooden half-hoops embroidered with green, similar to the so-called &quot;garland dances&quot; in northern Europe. There are also dances of love and courting, such as the &quot;duru-duru&quot; dance in Sardinia.

Many of these dances are group activities, the group setting up in rows or circles; some—the love and courting dances—involve couples, either a single couple or more. The (performed to the sound of the tambourine) is a couple dance performed in southern Italy and accompanied by a lyric song called a . Other couples dances are collectively referred to as saltarello. There are, however, also solo dances; most typical of these are the &quot;flag dances&quot; of various regions of Italy, in which the dancer passes a town flag or pennant around the neck, through the legs, behind the back, often tossing it high in the air and catching it. These dances can also be done in groups of solo dancers acting in unison or by coordinating flag passing between dancers. Northern Italy is also home to the , an accompanied dance that was incorporated in Western art music by the composer Muzio Clementi.

Academic interest in the study of dance from the perspectives of sociology and anthropology has traditionally been neglected in Italy but is currently showing renewed life at the university and post-graduate level.

== Popular music ==

The earliest Italian popular music was the opera of the 19th century. Opera has had a lasting effect on Italy&#x27;s classical and popular music. Opera tunes spread through brass bands and itinerant ensembles. &quot;Canzone Napoletana&quot;, or &quot;Neapolitan song&quot;, is a distinct tradition that became a part of popular music in the 19th century, and was an iconic image of Italian music abroad by the end of the 20th century.
Imported styles have also become an important part of Italian popular music, beginning with the French &quot;Café-chantant&quot; in the 1890s and then the arrival of American jazz in the 1910s. Until Italian Fascism became officially &quot;allergic&quot; to foreign influences in the late 1930s, American dance music and musicians were quite popular; jazz great Louis Armstrong toured Italy as late as 1935 to great acclaim. In the 1950s, American styles became more prominent, especially rock. The singer-songwriter &quot;cantautori&quot; tradition was a major development of the later 1960s, while the Italian rock scene soon diversified into progressive, punk, funk and folk-based styles.

=== Early popular song ===
Italian opera became immensely popular in the 19th century and was known across even the most rural sections of the country. Most villages had occasional opera productions, and the techniques used in opera influenced rural folk musics. Opera spread through itinerant ensembles and brass bands, focused in a local village. These civic bands (&quot;banda communale&quot;) used instruments to perform operatic arias, with trombones or fluegelhorns for male vocal parts and cornets for female parts.

Regional music in the 19th century also became popular throughout Italy. Notable among these local traditions was the &quot;Canzone Napoletana&quot;—the Neapolitan Song. Although there are anonymous, documented songs from Naples from many centuries ago, the term, &quot;canzone Napoletana&quot; now generally refers to a large body of relatively recent, composed popular music—such songs as &quot;&#x27;O Sole Mio&quot;, &quot;Torna a Surriento&quot;, and &quot;Funiculi Funicula&quot;. In the 18th century, many composers, including Alessandro Scarlatti, Leonardo Vinci, and Giovanni Paisiello, contributed to the Neapolitan tradition by using the local language for the texts of some of their comic operas. Later, others—most famously Gaetano Donizetti—composed Neapolitan songs that garnered great renown in Italy and abroad. The Neapolitan song tradition became formalized in the 1830s through an annual songwriting competition for the yearly Piedigrotta festival, dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the Mergellina area of Naples. The music is identified with Naples, but is famous abroad, having been exported on the great waves of emigration from Naples and southern Italy roughly between 1880 and 1920. Language is an extremely important element of Neapolitan song, which is always written and performed in Neapolitan, the regional minority language of Campania. Neapolitan songs typically use simple harmonies, and are structured in two sections, a refrain and narrative verses, often in contrasting relative or parallel major and minor keys. In non-musical terms, this means that many Neapolitan songs can sound joyful one minute and melancholy the next.

The music of Francesco Tosti was popular at the turn of the 20th century, and is remembered for his light, expressive songs. His style became very popular during the &quot;Belle Époque&quot; and is often known as salon music. His most famous works are &quot;Serenata&quot;, &quot;Addio&quot; and the popular Neapolitan song, &quot;Marechiaro&quot;, the lyrics of which are by the prominent Neapolitan dialect poet, Salvatore di Giacomo.

Recorded popular music began in the late 19th century, with international styles influencing Italian music by the late 1910s; however, the rise of &quot;autarchia&quot;, the Fascist policy of cultural isolationism in 1922 led to a retreat from international popular music. During this period, popular Italian musicians traveled abroad and learned elements of jazz, Latin American music and other styles. These musics influenced the Italian tradition, which spread around the world and further diversified following liberalization after World War II.

Under the isolationist policies of the fascist regime, which rose to power in 1922, Italy developed an insular musical culture. Foreign musics were suppressed while Mussolini&#x27;s government encouraged nationalism and linguistic and ethnic purity. Popular performers, however, travelled abroad, and brought back new styles and techniques. American jazz was an important influence on singers such as Alberto Rabagliati, who became known for a swinging style. Elements of harmony and melody from both jazz and blues were used in many popular songs, while rhythms often came from Latin dances like the tango, rumba and beguine. Italian composers incorporated elements from these styles, while Italian music, especially Neapolitan song, became a part of popular music across Latin America.

=== Modern pop ===

Among the best-known Italian pop musicians of the last few decades are Domenico Modugno, Mina, Mia Martini, Adriano Celentano, Claudio Baglioni, Ornella Vanoni, Patty Pravo and, more recently, Zucchero, Mango, Vasco Rossi, Gianna Nannini and international superstar Laura Pausini and Andrea Bocelli. Musicians who compose and sing their own songs are called &quot;cantautori&quot; (singer-songwriters). Their compositions typically focus on topics of social relevance and are often protest songs: this wave began in the 1960s with musicians like Fabrizio De André, Paolo Conte, Giorgio Gaber, Umberto Bindi, Gino Paoli and Luigi Tenco.

Social, political, psychological and intellectual themes, mainly in the wake of Gaber and De André&#x27;s work, became even more predominant in the 1970s through authors such as Lucio Dalla, Pino Daniele, Francesco De Gregori, Ivano Fossati, Francesco Guccini, Edoardo Bennato, Rino Gaetano and Roberto Vecchioni. Lucio Battisti, from the late 1960s until the mid-1990s, merged the Italian music with the British rock and pop and, lately in his career, with genres like the synthpop, rap, techno and Eurodance, while Angelo Branduardi and Franco Battiato pursued careers more oriented to the tradition of Italian pop music. There is some genre cross-over between the &quot;cantautori&quot; and those who are viewed as singers of &quot;protest music&quot;.

Film scores, although they are secondary to the film, are often critically acclaimed and very popular in their own right. Among early music for Italian films from the 1930s was the work of Riccardo Zandonai with scores for the films &quot;La Principessa Tarakanova&quot; (1937) and &quot;Caravaggio&quot; (1941). Post-war examples include Goffredo Petrassi with &quot;Non c&#x27;e pace tra gli ulivi&quot; (1950) and Roman Vlad with &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot; (1954). Another well-known film composer was Nino Rota whose post-war career included the scores for films by Federico Fellini and, later, &quot;The Godfather&quot; series. Other prominent film score composers include Ennio Morricone, Riz Ortolani and Piero Umiliani.

Italian pop music in the 2000s managed to cross national borders thanks, among others, to Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Zucchero, Andrea Bocelli, Tiziano Ferro, and Il Volo.


=== Modern dance ===


Italy has been an important country with regards to electronic dance music, especially ever since the creation of Italo disco in the late 1970s to early 1980s. The genre, originating from disco, blended &quot;melancholy melodies&quot; with pop and electronic music, making usage of synthesizers and drum machines, which often gave it a futuristic sound. According to an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in cities such as Verona and Milan, producers would work with singers, using mass-made synthesizers and drum machines, and incorporating them into a mix of experimental music with a &quot;classic-pop sensibility&quot; which would be aimed for nightclubs. The songs produced would often be sold later by labels and companies such as the Milan-based Discomagic.

Italo disco influenced several electronic groups, such as the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and New Order, as well as genres such as Eurodance, Eurobeat and freestyle. By circa 1988, however, the genre had merged into other forms of European dance and electronic music, one of which was Italo house. Italo house blended elements of Italo disco with traditional house music; its sound was generally uplifting, and made strong usage of piano melodies. Bands of this genre include: Black Box, East Side Beat, and 49ers.

By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as Italo dance emerged. Taking influences from Italo disco and Italo house, Italo dance generally included synthesizer riffs, a melodic sound, and the usage of vocoders. The genre became mainstream after the release of the single &quot;Blue (Da Ba Dee)&quot; by Eiffel 65, which became one of Italy&#x27;s most popular electronic groups; their album &quot;Europop&quot; was crowned as the greatest album of the 1990s by Channel 4. Also, a subgenre of Italo dance known as &quot;Lento Violento&quot; (&quot;slow and violent&quot;) was developed by Gigi D&#x27;Agostino as a much slower and harder type of music. The BPM is often reduced to the half of typical Italo dance tracks. The bass is often noticeably loud, and dominates the song.

Over the years, there have been several important Italian dance music composers and producers, such as Giorgio Moroder, who won three Academy Awards and four Golden Globes for his music. His work with synthesizers heavily influenced several music genres such as new wave, techno and house music; he is credited by Allmusic as &quot;One of the principal architects of the disco sound&quot;, and is also dubbed the &quot;Father of Disco&quot;.

=== Imported styles ===
During the &quot;Belle Époque&quot;, the French fashion of performing popular music at the &quot;café-chantant&quot; spread throughout Europe. The tradition had much in common with cabaret, and there is overlap between &quot;café-chantant&quot;, &quot;café-concert&quot;, &quot;cabaret&quot;, music hall, vaudeville and other similar styles, but at least in its Italian manifestation, the tradition remained largely apolitical, focusing on lighter music, often risqué, but not bawdy. The first &quot;café-chantant&quot; in Italy was the &quot;Salone Margherita&quot;, which opened in 1890 on the premises of the new Galleria Umberto in Naples. Elsewhere in Italy, the Gran Salone Eden in Milan and the Music Hall Olympia in Rome opened shortly thereafter. &quot;Café-chantant&quot; was alternately known as the Italianized &quot;caffè-concerto&quot;. The main performer, usually a woman, was called a &quot;chanteuse&quot; in French; the Italian term, &quot;sciantosa&quot;, is a direct coinage from the French. The songs, themselves, were not French, but were lighthearted or slightly sentimental songs composed in Italian. That music went out of fashion with the advent of World War I.
The influence of US pop forms has been strong since the end of World War II. Lavish Broadway-show numbers, Big Bands, rock and roll, and hip hop continue to be popular. Latin music, especially Brazilian bossa nova, is also popular, and the Puerto Rican genre of reggaeton is rapidly becoming a mainstream form of dance music. It is now not uncommon for modern Italian pop artists such as Laura Pausini, Eros Ramazzotti, Zucchero or Andrea Bocelli to release some new songs in English or Spanish in addition to the original Italian versions. The group Il Volo sings in Italian, English, Spanish and German. Thus, musical revues, which are standard fare on current Italian television, can easily go, in a single evening, from a big-band number with dancers to an Elvis impersonator to a current pop singer doing a rendition of a Puccini aria.

Jazz found its way into Europe during World War I through the presence of American musicians in military bands playing syncopated music. Yet, even before that, Italy received an inkling of new music from across the Atlantic in the form of &quot;Creole&quot; singers and dancers who performed at the Eden Theater in Milan in 1904; they billed themselves as the &quot;creators of the cakewalk.&quot; The first real jazz orchestras in Italy, however, were formed during the 1920s by bandleaders such as Arturo Agazzi and enjoyed immediate success. In spite of the anti-American cultural policies of the Fascist regime during the 1930s, American jazz remained popular.

In the immediate post-war years, jazz took off in Italy. All American post-war jazz styles, from bebop to free jazz and fusion have their equivalents in Italy. The universality of Italian culture ensured that jazz clubs would spring up throughout the peninsula, that all radio and then television studios would have jazz-based house bands, that Italian musicians would then start nurturing a home grown kind of jazz, based on European song forms, classical composition techniques and folk music. Currently, all Italian music conservatories have jazz departments, and there are jazz festivals each year in Italy, the best known of which is the Umbria Jazz Festival, and there are prominent publications such as the journal, &quot;Musica Jazz&quot;.
 

Italian pop rock has produced major stars like Zucchero, and has resulted in many top hits. The industry media, especially television, are important vehicles for such music; the television show &quot;Sabato Sera&quot; is characteristic. Italy was at the forefront of the progressive rock movement of the 1970s, a style that primarily developed in Europe but also gained audiences elsewhere in the world. It is sometimes considered a separate genre, Italian progressive rock. Italian bands such as The Trip, Area, Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM), Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, New Trolls, Goblin, Osanna, Saint Just and Le Orme incorporated a mix of symphonic rock and Italian folk music and were popular throughout Europe and the United States as well. Other progressive bands such as Perigeo, Balletto di Bronzo, Museo Rosenbach, Rovescio della Medaglia, Biglietto per l&#x27;Inferno or Alphataurus remained little known, but their albums are today considered classics by collectors. A few avant-garde rock bands or artists (Area, Picchio dal Pozzo, Opus Avantra, Stormy Six, Saint Just, Giovanni Lindo Ferretti) gained notoriety for their innovative sound. Progressive rock concerts in Italy tended to have a strong political undertone and an energetic atmosphere. Popular Italian metal bands include Rhapsody of Fire, Lacuna Coil, Elvenking, Forgotten Tomb, and Fleshgod Apocalypse.

The Italian hip hop scene began in the early 1990s with Articolo 31 from Milan, whose style was mainly influenced by East Coast rap. Other early hip hop crews were typically politically oriented, like 99 Posse, who later became more influenced by British trip hop. More recent crews include gangster rappers like Sardinia&#x27;s La Fossa. Other recently imported styles include techno, trance, and electronica performed by artists including Gabry Ponte, Eiffel 65, and Gigi D`Agostino. Hip hop is especially liked in southern Italy, joined with the southern concept of &quot;rispetto&quot; (&quot;respect&quot;, &quot;honor&quot;), a form of verbal jousting; both facts have helped identify southern Italian music with the African American hip hop style. Additionally, there are many bands in Italy that play a style called &quot;patchanka&quot;, which is characterized by a mixture of traditional music, punk, reggae, rock and political lyrics. Modena City Ramblers are one of the more popular bands known for their mix of Irish, Italian, punk, reggae and many other forms of music.

Italy has also become a home for a number of Mediterranean fusion projects. These include Al Darawish, a multicultural band based in Sicily and led by Palestinian Nabil Ben Salaméh. The Luigi Cinque Tarantula Hypertext Orchestra is another example, as is the TaraGnawa project by Phaleg and Nour Eddine. Mango is one of the best-known artists who fused pop with world and mediterranean sounds, albums such as &quot;Adesso&quot;, &quot;Sirtaki&quot; and &quot;Come l&#x27;acqua&quot; are examples of his style. The Neapolitan popular singer, Massimo Ranieri has also released a CD, &quot;Oggi o dimane&quot;, of traditional &quot;canzone Napoletana&quot; with North African rhythms and instruments.

== Industry ==

The music industry in Italy made €2.3 billion in 2004. That sum refers to the sale of CDs, music electronics, musical instruments, and ticket sales for live performances. By way of comparison, the Italian recording industry ranks eighth in the world; Italians own 0.7 music albums per capita as opposed to the US, in first-place with 2.7.

Nationwide, there are three state-run and three private TV networks. All provide live music at least some of the time. Many large cities in Italy have local TV stations, as well, which may provide live folk or dialect music often of interest only to the immediate area. The largest of these book and CD chain is Feltrinelli.

== Venues, festivals and holidays ==
Venues for music in Italy include concerts at the many music conservatories, symphony halls and opera houses. Italy also has many well-known international music festivals each year, including the Festival of Spoleto, the Festival Puccini and the Wagner Festival in Ravello. Some festivals offer venues to younger composers in classical music by producing and staging winning entries in competitions. The winner, for example, of the &quot;Orpheus&quot; International Competition for New Opera and Chamber music—besides winning considerable prize money—gets to see his or her musical work performed at The Spoleto Festival. There are also dozens of privately sponsored master classes in music each year that put on concerts for the public. Italy is also a common destination for well-known orchestras from abroad; at almost any given time during the busiest season, at least one major orchestra from elsewhere in Europe or North America is playing a concert in Italy. Additionally, public music may be heard at dozens of pop and rock concerts throughout the year. Open-air opera may even be heard, for example, at the ancient Roman amphitheater, the Verona Arena.
Military bands, too, are popular in Italy. At a national level, one of the best-known of these is the concert band of the &quot;Guardia di Finanza&quot; (Italian Customs/Border Police); it performs many times a year.

Many theaters also routinely stage not just Italian translations of American musicals, but true Italian musical comedy, which are called by the English term &quot;musical&quot;. In Italian, that term describes a kind of musical drama not native to Italy, a form that employs the American idiom of jazz-pop-and rock-based music and rhythms to move a story along in a combination of songs and dialogue.

Music in religious rituals, especially Catholic, manifests itself in a number of ways. Parish bands, for example, are quite common throughout Italy. They may be as small as four or five members to as many as 20 or 30. They commonly perform at religious festivals specific to a particular town, usually in honor of the town&#x27;s patron saint. The historic orchestral/choral masterpieces performed in church by professionals are well-known; these include such works as the Stabat Mater by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;. The Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 revolutionized music in the Catholic Church, leading to an increase in the number of amateur choirs that perform regularly for services; the council also encouraged the congregational singing of hymns, and a vast repertoire of new hymns has been composed in the last 40 years.
There is not a great deal of native Italian Christmas music. The most popular Italian Christmas carol is &quot;Tu scendi dalle stelle&quot;, the modern Italian words to which were written by Pope Pius IX in 1870. The melody is a major-key version of an older, minor-key Neapolitan carol &quot;Quanno Nascette Ninno&quot; of Alphonsus Liguori. Other than that, Italians largely sing translations of carols that come from the German and English tradition (&quot;Silent Night&quot;, for example). There is no native Italian secular Christmas music, which accounts for the popularity of Italian-language versions of &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and &quot;White Christmas&quot;.

The Sanremo Music Festival is an important venue for popular music in Italy. It has been held annually since 1951 and is currently staged at the Teatro Ariston in Sanremo. It runs for one week in February, and gives veteran and new performers a chance to present new songs. Winning the contest has often been a springboard to industry success. The festival is televised nationally for three hours a night, is hosted by the best-known Italian TV personalities, and has been a vehicle for such performers as Domenico Modugno, perhaps the best-known Italian pop singer of the last 50 years.

Television variety shows are the widest venue for popular music. They change often, but &quot;Buona Domenica&quot;, &quot;Domenica In&quot;, and &quot;I raccomandati&quot; are popular. The longest running musical broadcast in Italy is &quot;La Corrida&quot;, a three-hour weekly program of amateurs and would-be musicians. It started on the radio in 1968 and moved to TV in 1988. The studio audience bring cow-bells and sirens and are encouraged to show good-natured disapproval. The city with the highest number of rock concerts (of national and international artists) is Milan, with a number close to the other European music capitals, as Paris, London and Berlin.

== Education ==
Many institutes of higher education teach music in Italy. About 75 music conservatories provide advanced training for future professional musicians. There are also many private music schools and workshops for instrument building and repair. Private teaching is also quite common in Italy. Elementary and high school students can expect to have one or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic music theory, though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.

Italy has a specialized system of high schools; students attend, as they choose, a high school for humanities, science, foreign languages, or art—and music (in the &quot;liceo musicale&quot;, where instruments, musical theory, composing and musical history are taught as the main subject). Italy does have ambitious, recent programs to expose children to more music. Furthermore, with the recent education reform a specific &quot;Liceo musicale e coreutico&quot; (2nd level secondary school, ages 14–15 to 18–19) is explicitly indicated by the law decrees. Yet this kind of school has not been set up and is not effectively operational. The state-run television network has started a program to use modern satellite technology to broadcast choral music into public schools.

== Scholarship ==
Scholarship in the field of collecting, preserving and cataloguing all varieties of music is vast. In Italy, as elsewhere, these tasks are spread over a number of agencies and organizations. Most large music conservatories maintain departments that oversee the research connected with their own collections. Such research is coordinated on a national and international scale via the internet. One prominent institution in Italy is IBIMUS, the &quot;Istituto di Bibliografia Musicale&quot;, in Rome. It works with other agencies on an international scale through RISM, the &quot;Répertoire International des Sources Musicales&quot;, an inventory and index of source material. Also, the &quot;Discoteca di Stato&quot; (National Archives of Recordings) in Rome, founded in 1928, holds the largest public collection of recorded music in Italy with some 230,000 examples of classical music, folk music, jazz, and rock, recorded on everything from antique wax cylinders to modern electronic media.

The scholarly study of traditional Italian music began in about 1850, with a group of early philological ethnographers who studied the impact of music on a pan-Italian national identity. A unified Italian identity only just started to develop after the political integration of the peninsula in 1860. The focus at that time was on the lyrical and literary value of music, rather than the instrumentation; this focus remained until the early 1960s. Two folkloric journals helped to encourage the burgeoning field of study, the &quot;Rivista Italiana delle Tradizioni Popolari&quot; and &quot;Lares&quot;, founded in 1894 and 1912, respectively. The earliest major musical studies were on the Sardinian &quot;launeddas&quot; in 1913–1914 by Mario Giulio Fara; on Sicilian music, published in 1907 and 1921 by Alberto Favara; and studies of the music of Emilia Romagna in 1941 by Francesco Balilla Pratella.

The earliest recordings of Italian traditional music came in the 1920s, but they were rare until the establishment of the Centro Nazionale Studi di Musica Popolare at the National Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome. The Center sponsored numerous song collection trips across the peninsula, especially to southern and central Italy. Giorgio Nataletti was an instrumental figure in the center, and also made numerous recordings himself. The American scholar Alan Lomax and the Italian, Diego Carpitella, made an exhaustive survey of the peninsula in 1954. By the early 1960s, a roots revival encouraged more study, especially of northern musical cultures, which many scholars had previously assumed maintained little folk culture. The most prominent scholars of this era included Roberto Leydi, Ottavio Tiby and Leo Levi. During the 1970s, Leydi and Carpitella were appointed to the first two chairs of ethnomusicology at universities, with Carpitella at the University of Rome and Leydi at the University of Bologna. In the 1980s, Italian scholars began focusing less on making recordings, and more on studying and synthesizing the information already collected. Others studied Italian music in the United States and Australia, and the folk musics of recent immigrants to Italy.

<text>William Beamont (1797–1889) was an English solicitor and local philanthropist. He lived in the town of Warrington, in the north-west of England.

==Life==
Beamont was the first mayor of Warrington after its incorporation as a municipal borough in 1847. As mayor, he founded its municipal library, the first rate-aided library in the UK, in 1848. He travelled extensively, including in the Holy Land, where he met William Holman Hunt. His diaries, stored in the town&#x27;s main library, are a valuable source of social history. For many years he lived at Orford Hall. Beamont was a Member of the Chetham Society, and served as Member of Council (1849–82) and Vice-President (1879–82). He was also a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

A high school (Beamont Collegiate Academy) and a primary school in the town are named after him.

His grave lies in the churchyard of Christ Church, Padgate, one of several Church of England churches that he helped found.

==Family==
Beamont married Ann Gaskell (died 1859), daughter of John Gaskell of Warrington. He outlived his only son William John Beamont, who was a clergyman and author.

<text>California State University, San Marcos (CSUSM or Cal State San Marcos) is a public university in San Marcos, California, United States. It was founded in 1989 as the 21st campus in the California State University (CSU) system. CSUSM offers 43 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 24 master&#x27;s degree programs, 8 credential programs, and 1 joint doctoral with the University of California, San Diego.

CSUSM is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and also Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). The university had a total undergraduate enrollment of 15,431 students in fall 2024. In 2024, the university had 284 tenured faculty. The Cal State San Marcos Cougars compete in NCAA Division I as a member of the California Collegiate Athletic Association.

== History ==

Efforts by community and political leaders to bring a state university to North County date back to the 1960s. In 1969, the chancellor of the CSU system, Glenn S. Dumke, issued a report concluding that there was &quot;an ultimate need&quot; for a new university campus in the area.

In 1978, State Senator William A. Craven won $250,000 in state funding for a North County satellite campus of San Diego State University, which opened at Lincoln Junior High School in Vista with an enrollment of 148 students. In 1982, the satellite moved to larger quarters in an office building on Los Vallecitos Boulevard in San Marcos. When it appeared that the new San Marcos campus would be a satellite of San Diego State, CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds insisted on an independent university with the goal of creating leadership opportunities for women and minorities. CSUSM would also go on to attract more STEM-focused students than SDSU, as well. In September 1985, Senate Bill 1060, introduced by Craven, passed, appropriating $250,000 for a feasibility study on building a university in North County. By 1988, the enrollment of SDSU North County had reached 1,250 students, and the CSU board of trustees purchased for $10.6 million the future site of CSUSM, the 304-acre Prohoroff Poultry Farm in San Marcos. The hillside site lies approximately due east of the Pacific Ocean and due north of downtown San Diego. The CSU trustees also requested $51.8 million in state funds for the first phase of construction.

In 1989, Governor George Deukmejian signed Senate Bill 365 (also sponsored by Craven) into law, officially creating Cal State San Marcos. Bill W. Stacy was named the university&#x27;s first president in June 1989, and over the next year recruited the first 12 members of the faculty. These dozen &quot;founding faculty&quot; played an important role in the university&#x27;s early years and are today honored at Founders Plaza on the CSUSM campus. Stacy and the faculty were given $3.9 million to begin the university.

On February 23, 1990, ground was broken on the new campus, and construction began at the former chicken farm. In the fall of 1990, the first class enrolled at the new university: 448 juniors and seniors. (Initially, only upperclassmen were admitted to CSUSM.) While construction continued on the permanent campus, classes continued to be held at the former SDSU satellite location on Los Vallecitos Boulevard. An industrial facility on Stone Drive was also used to provide lab space for the biology program, and was used through January 1993. In 1991, the university conferred its first degrees, as seven students were awarded Bachelor of Arts degrees. CSUSM&#x27;s first official commencement ceremony was held in May 1992.

In the fall of 1992, the permanent CSUSM campus at Twin Oaks Valley Road opened. The first buildings were Craven Hall (opened December 1992), Academic Hall, Science Hall I, and the University Commons. The university had grown to 1,700 students and 305 faculty and staff.

The university continued to grow rapidly, and by 1993 CSUSM&#x27;s enrollment had grown to almost 2,500 and it received accreditation from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. In 1995, CSUSM admitted its first freshman class and offered lower-division (and general education) courses for the first time, with enrollment growing to 3,600. The same year, the College of Education was fully accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education.

In 1996, CSUSM received two major gifts: $1 million from Jean and W. Keith Kellogg II, the first of a series of gifts for the Kellogg Library, and a $1.3 million bequest from Lucille Griset Spicer (presented by Spicer&#x27;s siblings Richard H. Griset Sr. and Margaret Griset Liermann) to begin a student loan fund.

In early 1997, Stacy departed as university president, and Alexander Gonzalez was named interim president. In 1998, the CSU Board of Trustees made Gonzalez permanent president. By 1997, enrollment had grown to 4,400, the faculty had grown to 300 (including part-time instructors). The university also received additional major donations, including a $2.3 million gift from Leonard Evers to establish the Evers Computer Scholarship and a donation from Bob and Ruth Mangrum to build the Mangrum Track &amp; Soccer Field. The university intercollegiate athletics department opened in 1998, and initially consisted of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, cross-country, and track and field.

A campus &quot;building boom&quot; began, with the Foundation Classroom Buildings opening in December 1996, University Hall in 1998, Science Hall II and the Arts Building in August 2002, and the University Village Apartments and the nearby M. Gordon Clarke Field House in 2003. The University Village Apartments were the university&#x27;s first on-campus housing; the new student union, known as &quot;the Clarke,&quot; was funded by $1.2 million gift pledged in 1998 by Helene Clarke in honor of her husband.

The campus&#x27; first freestanding library, the five-story, nearly Kellogg Library later opened. The campus&#x27; Starbucks coffee is next to it.

In 2004, Karen S. Haynes was named the university&#x27;s third president, following Gonzalez&#x27;s departure the year previously, and the university announced that it planned to establish a nursing school. In the fall of 2004, over 7,000 students enrolled.

In 2006, the College of Business Administration&#x27;s Markstein Hall opened, funded by a 2003 state grant of almost $25 million and a 2005 pledge of $5 million from Kenneth and Carole Markstein. The School of Nursing opened in the fall of 2006.

The university&#x27;s first parking garage, the six-floor, 1,605-space Parking Structure I, is near the main campus. The 106,509 gross square foot Social and Behavioral Sciences Building at the north end of the campus is next to it.

CSUSM also has an Extended Learning program. According to its website: Extended Learning (EL) at California State University San Marcos serves as the academic outreach arm of the university. As a unit within the Academic Affairs Division, EL is North San Diego County&#x27;s premier provider of continuing education and training programs. Cal State San Marcos, and—by extension, EL—is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges.

For the 2011–2012 academic year, tuition and fees rose to $6,596, a 31% increase attributed to the state&#x27;s budget crisis; it was the largest such percentage increase in the United States.

In 2024, CSUSM broke ground on the development of a new housing building and dining commons. This is expected to be completed by summer 2026. This will add housing for more than 500 students.

== Demographics ==
In 2022 59% of the students were female, 41% male. There are also a sizable number of transfer students from community colleges. The &quot;local admissions area community colleges&quot; for CSU San Marcos are Mount San Jacinto College in Riverside County and Mira Costa College and Palomar College in San Diego County. About 50 percent of transfer students are from North San Diego County, 2 percent from San Diego County elsewhere; and 48 percent from Riverside County.

This CSU is still considered somewhat of a “small school”—especially in comparison to other San Diego County institutions such as San Diego State University and University of California, San Diego. Looking to expand, the campus master plan envisions the university growing to an enrollment of 25,000.

== Student life ==
There are over 100 recognized student organizations on campus. The student newspaper is called &quot; The Cougar Chronicle&quot;.

=== Greek life ===
CSUSM recognizes several fraternities and sororities, each belonging to one of three different governing councils. Social fraternities belong to the Inter-fraternity Council, while social sororities belong to the Panhellenic Council.

Additionally, cultural-interest fraternities and sororities belong to the Multicultural Greek Council.
=== University Student Union ===

The University Student Union (USU) consists of various student groups, cultural centers, a gender center, an LGBTQ+ center, an extended food court, a convenience store (called “The Market”), two game rooms, a ballroom, an outdoor amphitheater, and a commuter lounge which includes a shower and lockers. In the food court are a Panda Express, Kalamata, Qdoba, and Hilltop Bistro. On the east side of the USU is Crash&#x27;s Cafe (formerly Jazzman&#x27;s Cafe) and Bakery, which sells coffee and pastries. The USU offers many spaces for students to gather between classes with seating, electronic charging ports and restrooms. The indoor windows showcase panoramic views of the San Marcos valley.

=== University District (North City) and housing ===

North City, an urban district of San Marcos, intended to directly serve the entire North County San Diego community, is just across from the university&#x27;s main campus. See Northcity.com. Several other buildings, including student and market apartment complexes with ground-level restaurants, numerous small businesses and residential complexes, a medical center, and a hotel are all in the district.

The university has three housing options: the University Village Apartments (UVA), the Quad, and North Commons, which is exclusively for freshman. The first two are apartment-style dorms with fitness centers, pools, game rooms, common areas, and more, and North Commons is traditional, more dorm-style housing. The Quad is directly east of the university&#x27;s Extended Learning Building (ELB) which is directly linked to campus with a second-level pedestrian bridge. The university also plans to expand housing with a new building to replace what is currently UVA Parking Lot. the proposed building will add 600 beds and a second dining hall. the university has committed some of these beds to be available to house the low-income students.

=== Transportation ===
The Sprinter hybrid rail service provides service to a station on the northeast corner of the campus. It was intentionally constructed near the University Village Apartments. It connects the campus to other cities of north San Diego County, including Oceanside, Vista and Escondido.

== Athletics ==
The Cal State–San Marcos (CSUSM) athletic teams are called the Cougars, and their official colors are bright/royal blue and white. The university is a member of the Division II level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) since the 2015–16 academic year. The Cougars previously competed as an NAIA Independent within the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1998 to 1999 (when the school joined the NAIA) to 2014–15.

CSUSM competes in 15 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball. Former sports included cheerleading and dance.

=== Mascot ===
The original mascot of the campus was &quot;Tukwut&quot;, the name for the California mountain lion in the Luiseño language of the local Native American Luiseño people. However, the mascot was &quot;dropped for something with more ring,&quot; and in a referendum students selected &quot;cougar&quot; over &quot;mountain lion.&quot; The dropping of the indigenous word was criticized by a faculty member at CSU San Marcos.

<doc id="383455" wikidata="Q248051" url="?curid=383455" title="The Devil in Miss Jones">
<text>The Devil in Miss Jones is a 1973 pornographic film, written, directed and produced by Gerard Damiano, inspired by the 1944 play &quot;No Exit&quot; by French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Starring Georgina Spelvin and Harry Reems, it is widely regarded as a classic adult film, released during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984). After his 1972 success with &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, Damiano shot the film in a converted apple-packing plant in Milanville, Pennsylvania.

Alongside &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;, &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; is associated with a time in American culture known as &quot;porno chic&quot;, in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert). The film went on to spawn numerous remakes and sequels.

As with many films of the Golden Age of Porn, the copyright status of &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; is unresolved. VCX claims a copyright; rival distributor Arrow Productions distributed unauthorized copies for a time before 2009, when (as part of a mutual truce between the companies) Arrow agreed to accept VCX&#x27;s claim in exchange for not challenging Arrow&#x27;s claim on &quot;Deep Throat&quot;.

==Plot==
Fed up with life, Justine Jones, a lonely and depressed spinster, decides that suicide is the only way out of her routinely dull existence. She slits her wrists with a shaving blade while bathing, and dies.

The angel Abaca informs Jones that although she has lived a &quot;pure&quot; life, her suicide has disqualified her from entering Heaven, and she must spend eternity in Limbo. Angered that her sole indiscretion has left her with only the options of Limbo or Hell, Jones begs Abaca to let her &quot;earn&quot; her place in Hell by being allowed to return to Earth and become the embodiment of Lust. After an intense session of pain and pleasure with a menacing man, known only by the title of &quot;The Teacher&quot;, Justine has several bizarre and sexually deviant encounters, the last of which is a graphic threesome.

Just as Jones is enjoying her new life of lust, the time she was given to fulfill herself runs out, and she is faced with eternity in Hell. Though initially horrified at the pain she will be forced to endure, Abaca dispels the common human myth of Hell, promising Jones that she will in fact be &quot;quite comfortable&quot;. Now a raging sex addict, Jones is confined to a small room with an impotent man who is more interested in catching flies than her. She desperately begs the man for sex, but he merely asks her to be quiet while he listens for the buzzing of the insects.

==Georgina Spelvin==

At the time of production, Spelvin was 36. &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; was one of her first acting appearances following a career as a chorus girl on Broadway where she was featured in productions such as &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;.

Her role in &quot;The Devil&quot; was typical of her career, as she often played celibate spinsters who have a sexual awakening, then become sex fiends (e.g. &quot;Sleepyhead&quot;). She also meets a tragic end in several of her other films. The film marked the debut of her moniker Georgina Spelvin, a reference to George Spelvin, a traditional stagename used to hide a performer&#x27;s identity, for any number of reasons. According to her interview on Dave&#x27;s Old Porn, Spelvin also did the craft services and cooking on the set. The actress billed in the movie as Claire Lumiere was hired to do craft services only, but was offered $100 to do a lesbian scene with Spelvin, which she accepted.

In an audio interview with The Rialto Report in 2013, Spelvin spoke about how she and Lumiere were lovers at the time, and they accepted the adult film work as a means of raising money for their film collective.

==Box office==
The movie was given an X rating by the MPAA and premiered at the 57th Street Playhouse in New York City. In many theaters it was shown after &quot;Deep Throat&quot; as part of a double bill. &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; broke the box office record for a pornographic film. It was more commercially successful than both &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;, and successfully competed against mainstream films. It earned $15 million in gross rental at the U.S. box office, making it the tenth most successful film of 1973, just behind &quot;Paper Moon&quot; with Ryan O&#x27;Neal and &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; with Roger Moore.

==Critical reception==
As with the other films of the porno chic era, it was reviewed by the film critics of mainstream newspapers. The film&#x27;s review in &quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;With &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, the hard-core porno feature approaches an art form, one that critics may have a tough time ignoring in the future&quot;, and compared its plot to Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s play &quot;No Exit&quot;. The review went on to say, &quot;Damiano has expertly fashioned a bizarre melodrama&quot;, and described the opening scene as &quot;a sequence so effective it would stand out in any legit theatrical feature&quot;. It finished by stating, &quot;Booking a film of this technical quality into a standard sex house is tantamount to throwing it on the trash heap of most current hard-core fare.&quot;

According to Peter Michelson, there is, &quot;a relatively small corpus of [pornographic] films—e.g., &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, &quot;Devil in Miss Jones&quot;, &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;—that have a minimal but still sufficient artistic interest to distinguish themselves from the rest of the genre&quot;.

Other critics have described it as, along with &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, one of the &quot;two best erotic motion pictures ever made&quot;. Roger Ebert gave &quot;Deep Throat&quot; a no-stars rating, but described &quot;The Devil in Miss Jones&quot; as the &quot;best&quot; of the genre he had seen and gave it three stars out of a possible four. He wrote that the relatively high production values and storytelling were partly the reason for his positive review, but that Spelvin&#x27;s performance was the main draw: &quot;she is not only the best, but possibly the only, actress in the hard-core field. By that I mean when she&#x27;s on the screen, her body and actions aren&#x27;t the only reasons we&#x27;re watching her. Alone among porno stars, she never seems exploited.&quot; Elsewhere (in the December, 1973 review for &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;), Ebert wrote: &quot;The only hard-core film I&#x27;ve seen that was effectively erotic was &#x27;The Devil in Miss Jones&#x27; -- and it was erotic not because of its hard-core content but in spite of it. It worked because its star, Georgina Spelvin, was so able to project emotion, involvement, and abandon. [...] The genius of &#x27;The Devil in Miss Jones&#x27; was that the title character had a fictional reality and motivation that made the sex scenes credible.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also gave the film three stars out of four and called it &quot;a cut above the average skin flick, and that explains why it has done sensational business in New York and Los Angeles. It has a story. It is well photographed. It has a central character who makes a little sense.&quot; Critical reception was not entirely positive. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was negative and called it &quot;a ridiculous new porno film ... which a lot of people, who should have known better, seem to have been conned into finding a breakthrough movie.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that film left him &quot;at a loss to know how to review. It has a cinematic proficiency &#x27;Deep Throat&#x27; lacks and it also has pretensions to a plot. But the plot is still a wraparound for the gymnastics, the appeal is to the hard-core audience and you have the feeling that what is needed is not a review but a second opinion from Masters and Johnson or any competent physiologist.&quot;

Filmmaker William Friedkin has called it a &quot;great film&quot;, partly because it was one of the few porn films with a proper storyline. It was one of the first films to be inducted into the XRCO Hall of Fame.

==Soundtrack==
The theme for the film was &quot;I&#x27;m Comin&#x27; Home&quot;, sung by Linda November.

Dialogue was heavily sampled on a track called &quot;The Teacher&quot; by electronic outfit Wave Mechanics in 1991 on the Oh&#x27;Zone label - the label who first released the acid house classic &quot;Chime&quot; by British electronic music pioneers Orbital before it became a crossover hit in the UK.

==Home media==
In 2006, VCX employed Media Blasters to digitally re-master the film from the original 35mm film into a &quot;Definitive Collectors Edition&quot; 2-Disc set on DVD. This latest revision has been repackaged and supposedly has the best picture and audio quality of any original Devil in Miss Jones release. The DVDs contain the remastered feature, audio commentary with director Damiano, a lengthy in-depth interview with Spelvin, the original trailer, the cable TV version, and a photo gallery.

<text>Doordarshan (), abbreviated as DD, is India&#x27;s state-owned public television broadcaster. Established by the Government of India on 15 September 1959, it is owned by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and constitutes one of Prasar Bharati&#x27;s two divisions. Doordarshan, one of India&#x27;s largest broadcasting organisations in terms of studio and transmitter infrastructure, delivers television, radio, online, and mobile services across metropolitan and regional India, as well as internationally. It also broadcasts via digital terrestrial transmitters.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===

The channel began modestly as an experimental broadcaster in Delhi on 15 September 1959, with a small transmitter and a makeshift studio. Regular daily transmission commenced in 1965 as part of All India Radio, with a five-minute news bulletin read by Pratima Puri. Salma Sultan joined Doordarshan in 1967, and became a news anchor. Thereafter, Gitanjali Aiyar, Neethi Ravindran, and Rini Simon became popular news anchors in the 1970s.

&quot;Krishi Darshan&quot;, which debuted on Doordarshan on 26 January 1967, holds the distinction of being Indian television&#x27;s longest-running programme.

Television services were expanded to Bombay (now Mumbai) and Amritsar in 1972. By 1975, only seven Indian cities had access to television, with Doordarshan being the sole provider in the country.

On 1 April 1976, television services were officially separated from radio. All India Radio and Doordarshan were placed under the management of separate Directors-Generals in New Delhi. In 1982, Doordarshan transitioned into a national broadcaster.

=== Nationwide transmission ===

National telecasts (DD National) were introduced in 1982. Colour television in India was introduced with the live telecast of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Independence Day speech on 15 August 1982, followed by the colour broadcast of the 1982 Asian Games held in Delhi. Two years later, Doordarshan evolved into a structured TV network. The sole TV channel was split into DD-1, a nationally broadcast channel, and DD-2, a city-focused channel. In 1993, they were rebranded as DD National and DD Metro, respectively, to compete with the then-newly privatised television industry.

The live telecasts of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics were aired on Doordarshan&#x27;s national channel, while DD Sports offered round-the-clock coverage of the event.

On 17 November 2014, Doordarshan director-general Vijayalaxmi Chhabra introduced a pink-and-purple colour scheme with a new slogan: &quot;Desh Ka Apna Channel&quot; (&quot;The country&#x27;s own channel&quot;). In 2017, Doordarshan operated a network of nearly 1,400 terrestrial transmitters and had 46 studios producing television programmes. After the introduction of private channels, Doordarshan has faced challenges in maintaining its position in the television industry. Currently, Doordarshan is focusing on improving its studios and programmes, with its primary aim being to serve the nation..

DD National and DD News—along with 17 regional satellite channels, 11 state networks, an international channel (DD India), a sports channel (DD Sports), cultural and informative channels like DD Bharati and DD Urdu, and an agricultural channel, DD Kisan. On DD National (formerly DD-1), regional and local programs are aired on a time-sharing basis for terrestrial broadcasting only. DD News, launched on 3 November 2003, replaced DD Metro (formerly DD-2), providing 24-hour news coverage. These channels are relayed through all terrestrial transmitters in India. The regional-language satellite channels consist of two components: a regional service for a specific state (relayed by all terrestrial transmitters in that state) and additional regional-language programs available through cable and DTH operators. DD Sports broadcasts both national and international sporting events and is the only channel to air rural sports such as kho-kho and kabaddi.

A new regional channel, DD Arunprabha, was initially scheduled to begin broadcasting on 15 February 2018, focusing on the North Eastern region of India as a 24/7 satellite television channel. However, its launch was delayed and eventually took place on 9 February 2019.

On 9 March 2019, Prasar Bharati expanded the satellite footprint of India through DD Free Dish by adding 11 more state DD channels. This included five channels for the North Eastern states: DD Bangla, DD Chhattisgarh, DD Goa, DD Haryana, DD Himachal Pradesh, DD Jharkhand, DD Manipur, DD Meghalaya, DD Mizoram, DD Nagaland, DD Tripura, and DD Uttarakhand. DD Bangla, launched on 9 August 1975, features a programming mix that includes soap operas, infotainment series, news and current affairs, social programs, and films, all in Bangla.

On 13 April 2020, Prasar Bharati launched DD Retro, a channel dedicated to airing classic Hindi serials from Doordarshan. However, the service ceased operations on 1 April 2023 due to low viewership.

==Channel list==
Doordarshan operates 40 channels including HD feeds.

=== Regional channels (28) ===

==OTT Platform==
== International broadcasting ==
The DD India satellite channel has been broadcast in 146 countries. In the United Kingdom, it was available through the Eurobird satellite on the Sky system&#x27;s channel 833, under the logo Rayat TV. However, transmission via Sky Digital ended in June 2008, followed by the termination of its broadcast via DirecTV in the United States the following month.

== Record viewership during the pandemic ==

The &quot;Ramayan&quot; on DD National set a world record by becoming the highest-viewed entertainment programme globally. The 9 pm show on 16 April 2020 was watched by 77 million viewers. The show reached over 285 million viewers during its broadcast. In response to the nationwide lockdown, DD network aired several nostalgic shows, including &quot;Mahabharat&quot;, &quot;Chanakya&quot;, &quot;Shri Krishna&quot;, &quot;Malgudi Days&quot;, &quot;Byomkesh Bakshi&quot;, and &quot;Shaktimaan&quot;. Due to increasing public demand for such content, Prasar Bharati launched DD Retro, a full-time channel dedicated to these classics. Within five weeks of its launch, DD Retro garnered viewership of nearly 50 million. Additionally, DD network played a key role in public messaging during the pandemic, reaching over 400 million viewers with COVID-19 awareness messages and shows during the first wave in 2020.

== Criticisms ==
Prasar Bharati is the parent body of Doordarshan, and its board members are appointed by the Government of India through the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

Doordarshan has been used, particularly during the Emergency, to disseminate government propaganda. During Operation Blue Star in 1984, only government sources were relied upon for reporting the events. Additionally, Doordarshan was involved in the production of a video that claimed acts of violence, which, when investigated by independent journalists, were found to be false.

In 2004, it censored a controversial documentary on Jayaprakash Narayan, an opposition leader during the Emergency.

In 2014, Doordarshan broadcast a 70-minute Vijayadashami speech by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader Mohan Bhagwat, which led to criticism of the Narendra Modi administration and the BJP for &quot;misusing&quot; the public broadcaster. DD Director-General Archana Datta responded, stating, &quot;The speech was like any other news event; therefore, we covered it.&quot;

Since private television channels were authorised in 1991, Doordarshan has experienced a steep decline in viewership. Although Doordarshan earns significant advertising revenue—due to its compulsory feed from the highest bidder for national events, including cricket matches— there has been a proposal to fund the network by imposing a licence fee for owning a television in India.

==Legacy==
A film named after the broadcaster, spiritually motivated by the 2003 German film &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot;, was released in February 2020.

<doc id="383472" wikidata="Q190434" url="?curid=383472" title="Moodle">
<text>Moodle ( ) is a free and open-source learning management system written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License. Moodle is used for blended learning, distance education, flipped classroom and other online learning projects in schools, universities, workplaces and other sectors.

Moodle is used to create custom websites with online courses and allows for community-sourced plugins.

== Overview ==

Moodle was originally developed by Martin Dougiamas to help educators and scholars create online courses and focus on interaction and collaborative construction of content. The first version of Moodle was released on , and it continues to be actively developed.

The Moodle Project is led and coordinated by Moodle HQ, an Australian company, that is financially supported by a network of eighty Moodle Partner service companies worldwide. Development is also assisted by the open-source community.

Moodle is a learning platform used to augment and move existing learning environments online. As an E-learning tool, Moodle developed several features now considered standard for learning management systems, such as a calendar and gradebook.

Plugins, custom graphical themes, mobile responsive web design, and a Moodle mobile app are available to customize each individual&#x27;s experience on the platform. Moodle&#x27;s mobile app is available on Google Play, the App Store for iOS, the F-Droid Android FLOSS repository, and the Windows Phone Store.

== E-learning standards support ==

Moodle has adopted the following e-learning standards:
* The Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) is a collection of E-learning standards and specifications that define communications between client-side content and a server-side learning management system, as well as how externally authored content should be packaged to integrate with the LMS effectively. There are two versions: SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004. Moodle is SCORM 1.2 compliant and passes all the tests in the ADL Conformance test suite 1.2.7 for SCORM 1.2. SCORM 2004 is not supported in Moodle; however, Rustici Software has a Moodle plugin that turn any Moodle site into a fully compliant SCORM 2004 LMS.
* The AICC HACP standard for CMI was developed by the Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee (AICC) and is used to call externally authored content and assessment packages. AICC content packages are supported in Moodle 2.1 - Moodle 4.2.
* IMS Common Cartridge packages can also be imported into Moodle. In addition, Moodle Book activities can be exported as IMS Content Packages.
* Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) is a standard way of integrating rich learning applications ,(often remotely hosted and provided through third-party services) with educational platforms. Moodle uses the External Tool activity to act as an &#x27;LTI consumer&#x27; as standard and will act as an &#x27;LTI provider&#x27; using a plugin.

== Deployment ==

Users can download and install Moodle on a Web server, such as the Apache HTTP Server, and a number of database management systems, such as MySQL, are supported. Pre-built combinations of Moodle with a Web server and database are available for Microsoft Windows and Mac. Other automated installation approaches exist, such as installing a Debian package, deploying a ready-to-use TurnKey Moodle appliance, using the Bitnami installer, or using a &quot;one-click install&quot; service such as Installatron.

Certified Moodle Partners provide other Moodle services, including hosting, training, customization and content development. This network of providers supports the development of the Moodle project through royalties.

==Interoperability==

Moodle runs without modification on Unix, Linux, FreeBSD, Windows, MacOS and any other systems that support PHP and a database, including web host providers.

Moodle also has import features for use with other specific systems, such as importing quizzes or entire courses from Blackboard or WebCT.

In March 2012 Blackboard acquired two companies based on Moodle&#x27;s software including Baltimore-based Moodlerooms Inc. and NetSpot of Adelaide, Australia. In August 2015, Blackboard acquired Colombia-based Nivel7. The Red Hat site, Opensource.com, reported that Moodle will always be an open-source project, with clear delineation between Blackboard and Moodle.

== Background ==

=== Origins ===
Martin Dougiamas, who has graduate degrees in computer science and education, wrote the first version of Moodle. Dougiamas started a Ph.D. to examine &quot;the use of open source software to support a social constructionist epistemology of teaching and learning within Internet-based communities of reflective inquiry.&quot; Although how exactly social constructivism makes Moodle different from other eLearning platforms is difficult to show, it has been cited as an important factor by Moodle adopters. Other Moodle adopters, such as the Open University in the UK, have pointed out that Learning Management Systems can equally be seen as &quot;relatively pedagogy-neutral&quot;.

=== Pedagogical approach ===
The stated philosophy of Moodle includes a constructivist and social constructionist approach to education, emphasizing that learners (and not just teachers) can contribute to the educational experience. Using these pedagogical principles, Moodle provides an environment for learning communities.

=== Origin of name ===
The acronym &quot;Moodle&quot; officially stands for &quot;modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment&quot;. When the project was first started, the &quot;m&quot; instead stood for &quot;Martin&#x27;s&quot;, after original developer Martin Dougiamas. Besides being an acronym, the name was also chosen because of the dictionary definition of Moodle, with connotations such as &quot;tinkering&quot;, &quot;insight&quot;, and &quot;creativity&quot;, as well as to correspond to an available domain name.

== Development ==
Moodle has continued to evolve since 1999 (since 2001 with the current architecture). It has been translated into over 100 different languages and is accessible in many countries worldwide. Institutions can add as many Moodle servers as needed without having to pay license fees. 

== Moodle conferences ==
The MoodleMoot is a conference for Moodle community members to learn about Moodle, share experiences of the learning platform, discuss research in related educational technologies and contribute ideas to future Moodle development. Held around the world, MoodleMoots are organised by universities or other large organizations using Moodle, Moodle Partners, Moodle associations or Moodle HQ. 2020 saw the #Moot move to a virtual conference.

==Adoption==
Moodle has over 50% of its market share in Europe, Latin America, and Oceania.

In the U.S. higher education market as of fall 2021, the top three learning management systems (LMS) by number of institutions were Canvas (30%), Moodle (21%), and Blackboard (20%). In 2013, Moodle was for a time the second largest provider with 23% market share, following Blackboard (41%). However, by 2017, Moodle had dropped to the third largest provider, due in part to increased adoption of Instructure&#x27;s semi-open source Canvas platform. In March 2016, Blackboard became an official Moodle partner, although this partnership ended in 2018.

In the UK, the Open University currently uses a Moodle installation for their 200,000 users while the government uses a Moodle installation for the Civil Service Learning platform serving half a million employees.

<text>Fairhaven College of Interdisciplinary Studies is an interdisciplinary liberal arts college at Western Washington University. Instead of completing the general education requirements at Western, students take interdisciplinary classes at Fairhaven, which aim to cover the same breadth and depth of subjects, but within small, interdisciplinary seminars. When it comes time to move onto &quot;concentrated studies,&quot; students have the option of pursuing any of the majors or minors offered by Western Washington University, but may also choose to shape their own interdisciplinary concentration or major, combining independent study, internships, and Western Washington University courses with Fairhaven courses to define their course of study. Another unique feature of the college: nearly all classes follow a small seminar format rather than a large lecture format. Class enrollment is rarely above twenty students and will sometimes have two professors for a given class instead of only one. Fairhaven students do not receive letter grades; instead, they are given narrative evaluations, in addition to writing their own self-evaluations, for each class.

==History==

Founded in 1967, with a five-member faculty and an initial class of thirteen students, Fairhaven was housed in the former Latter Day Saints House. Fairhaven students lived in the Western dorms and took classes both at Western and at Fairhaven, while helping plan Fairhaven&#x27;s future. During that academic year and the next one, Fairhaven&#x27;s campus was under construction just south of Western&#x27;s campus. The 1968 academic year saw Fairhaven&#x27;s first full-size class of 200 students arrive. That class lived and held its Fairhaven seminars in Edens Hall, which also held its faculty and administration offices. In the 1969 academic year, Fairhaven moved to its new campus.

Initially, Fairhaven was to be a residential college, with its students required to live on campus for all of their four years there. But in 1970, a restive student body successfully agitated to have the residential requirement reduced to two years, and a substantial portion of the junior and senior classes moved off campus. Today, there is no residential requirement at Fairhaven, and its dorms are available to all Western students.

<doc id="383479" wikidata="Q978297" url="?curid=383479" title="Binary system">
<text>A binary system is a system of two astronomical bodies of the same kind that are comparable in size. Definitions vary, but typically require the center of mass to be located outside of either object. (See animated examples.)

The most common kinds of binary system are binary stars and binary asteroids, but brown dwarfs, planets, neutron stars, black holes and galaxies can also form binaries.

A &quot;multiple system&quot; is similar but consists of three or more objects, for example triple stars and triple asteroids (a more common term than &#x27;trinary&#x27;).

== Classification ==
In a binary system, the brighter or more massive object is referred to as primary, and the other the secondary. 

Binary stars are also classified based on orbit. Wide binaries are objects with orbits that keep them apart from one another. They evolve separately and have very little effect on each other. Close binaries are close to each other and are able to transfer mass from one another. They can also be classified based on how we observe them. Visual binaries are two stars separated enough that they can be distinguished through binoculars or a small telescope.

Eclipsing binaries are where the objects&#x27; orbits are at an angle that when one passes in front of the other it causes an eclipse, as seen from Earth.
Astrometric binaries are objects that seem to move around nothing as their companion object cannot be identified, it can only be inferred. The companion object may not be bright enough or may be hidden in the glare from the primary object.

A related classification though not a binary system is optical binary, which refers to objects that are so close together in the sky that they appear to be a binary system, but are not. Such objects merely appear to be close together, but lie at different distances from the Solar System.

== Binary companion (minor planets) ==

When binary minor planets are similar in size, they may be called &quot;binary companions&quot; instead of referring to the smaller body as a satellite. Good examples of true binary companions are the 90 Antiope and the 79360 Sila–Nunam systems. Pluto and its largest moon Charon are sometimes described as a binary system because the barycenter (center of mass) of the two objects is not inside either of them, but Charon is small enough compared to Pluto that it is usually classified as a moon. Orcus and its moon Vanth also orbit around a barycenter not inside either of them.
The Sun and Jupiter orbit a point outside of either, but are not considered a binary because they are different kinds of objects.

<doc id="383480" wikidata="Q4724364" url="?curid=383480" title="Algorithmic learning theory">
<text>Algorithmic learning theory is a mathematical framework for analyzing 
machine learning problems and algorithms. Synonyms include formal learning theory and algorithmic inductive inference. Algorithmic learning theory is different from statistical learning theory in that it does not make use of statistical assumptions and analysis. Both algorithmic and statistical learning theory are concerned with machine learning and can thus be viewed as branches of computational learning theory.

==Distinguishing characteristics==

Unlike statistical learning theory and most statistical theory in general, algorithmic learning theory does not assume that data are random samples, that is, that data points are independent of each other. This makes the theory suitable for domains where observations are (relatively) noise-free but not random, such as language learning and automated scientific discovery.

The fundamental concept of algorithmic learning theory is learning in the limit: as the number of data points increases, a learning algorithm should converge to a correct hypothesis on &quot;every&quot; possible data sequence consistent with the problem space. This is a non-probabilistic version of statistical consistency, which also requires convergence to a correct model in the limit, but allows a learner to fail on data sequences with probability measure 0 .

Algorithmic learning theory investigates the learning power of Turing machines. Other frameworks consider a much more restricted class of learning algorithms than Turing machines, for example, learners that compute hypotheses more quickly, for instance in polynomial time. An example of such a framework is probably approximately correct learning .

==Learning in the limit==

The concept was introduced in E. Mark Gold&#x27;s seminal paper &quot;Language identification in the limit&quot;. The objective of language identification is for a machine running one program to be capable of developing another program by which any given sentence can be tested to determine whether it is &quot;grammatical&quot; or &quot;ungrammatical&quot;. The language being learned need not be English or any other natural language - in fact the definition of &quot;grammatical&quot; can be absolutely anything known to the tester.

In Gold&#x27;s learning model, the tester gives the learner an example sentence at each step, and the learner responds with a hypothesis, which is a suggested program to determine grammatical correctness. It is required of the tester that every possible sentence (grammatical or not) appears in the list eventually, but no particular order is required. It is required of the learner that at each step the hypothesis must be correct for all the sentences so far.

A particular learner is said to be able to &quot;learn a language in the limit&quot; if there is a certain number of steps beyond which its hypothesis no longer changes. At this point it has indeed learned the language, because every possible sentence appears somewhere in the sequence of inputs (past or future), and the hypothesis is correct for all inputs (past or future), so the hypothesis is correct for every sentence. The learner is not required to be able to tell when it has reached a correct hypothesis, all that is required is that it be true.

Gold showed that any language which is defined by a Turing machine program can be learned in the limit by another Turing-complete machine using enumeration. This is done by the learner testing all possible Turing machine programs in turn until one is found which is correct so far - this forms the hypothesis for the current step. Eventually, the correct program will be reached, after which the hypothesis will never change again (but note that the learner does not know that it won&#x27;t need to change).

Gold also showed that if the learner is given only positive examples (that is, only grammatical sentences appear in the input, not ungrammatical sentences), then the language can only be guaranteed to be learned in the limit if there are only a finite number of possible sentences in the language (this is possible if, for example, sentences are known to be of limited length).

Language identification in the limit is a highly abstract model. It does not allow for limits of runtime or computer memory which can occur in practice, and the enumeration method may fail if there are errors in the input. However the framework is very powerful, because if these strict conditions are maintained, it allows the learning of any program known to be computable. This is because a Turing machine program can be written to mimic any program in any conventional programming language. See Church-Turing thesis.

==Other identification criteria==

Learning theorists have investigated other learning criteria, such as the following.

* &quot;Efficiency&quot;: minimizing the number of data points required before convergence to a correct hypothesis.
* &quot;Mind Changes&quot;: minimizing the number of hypothesis changes that occur before convergence.

Mind change bounds are closely related to mistake bounds that are studied in statistical learning theory. Kevin Kelly has suggested that minimizing mind changes is closely related to choosing maximally simple hypotheses in the sense of Occam’s Razor.

==Annual conference==
Since 1990, there is an &quot;International Conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT)&quot;, called &quot;Workshop&quot; in its first years (1990–1997). Between 1992 and 2016, proceedings were published in the LNCS series. Starting from 2017, they are published by the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research. The 34th conference will be held in Singapore in Feb 2023. The topics of the conference cover all of theoretical machine learning, including statistical and computational learning theory, online learning, active learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning.

<text>Marat Mubinovich Safin (; ; born 27 January 1980) is a Russian former professional tennis player and former politician. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for nine weeks. Safin won 15 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two majors at the 2000 US Open and 2005 Australian Open, and helped lead Russia to Davis Cup titles in 2002 and 2006.

Safin received four ATP Awards: 1998 Newcomer of the Year, 2000 Most Improved Player, and the 2001 and 2002 Fans&#x27; Favourite. When he first reached the world No. 1 ranking in November 2000, he became (at the time) the youngest No. 1 in the Open Era. Safin retired from the sport in November 2009. In 2016, he became the first Russian tennis player inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Safin is also the older brother of former women&#x27;s world No. 1 player Dinara Safina; they are the only brother-sister tandem in tennis history to have both achieved No. 1 singles rankings.

In 2011, Safin became a member of the State Duma representing the United Russia party.

== Early life ==
Safin was born in Moscow to Tatar parents, Mubin (&quot;Mikhail&quot;) Safin and Rauza Islanova. His ancestors come from Mishar village Bolshoye Rybushkino, located in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. He speaks Russian, English, and Spanish. His parents are former tennis players and coaches. His younger sister, Dinara, is a former world No. 1 professional tennis player and silver medalist at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Safin&#x27;s father managed the local Spartak Tennis Club, where Safin trained in his youth.

At the age of 14, Safin moved to Valencia, Spain to gain access to advanced tennis training programs which were not available in Russia. Safin says he grew &quot;very fast ... with no muscles&quot; and that he moved to Spain because clay courts were &quot;better for the knees&quot;.

== Tennis career ==
=== Early career ===
Safin started his professional career in 1997. In 1998, Safin consecutively defeated Andre Agassi and defending champion Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open. He won his first ATP title at the age of 19, in Boston, and later in 1999 he reached the Paris, Bercy final, losing a closely contested four-set match to No. 1 Andre Agassi.

=== World No. 1 and Grand Slam history ===

Safin held the No. 1 ATP ranking for 9 weeks during 2000 when he won his first Grand Slam tournament at the US Open, becoming the first Russian in history to win this tournament in the men&#x27;s singles draw, by defeating Pete Sampras in straight sets. He barely missed finishing the year as No. 1, the top spot being overtaken by Gustavo Kuerten at the last match of the season, the final of the 2000 Tennis Masters Cup and ATP Tour World Championships (3-0 win over Andre Agassi).

Safin reached three more Grand Slam finals, all at the Australian Open (2002, 2004, and 2005). He has cited nervousness as the reason for his loss in the 2002 event, and physical exhaustion for the 2004 loss. He defeated Lleyton Hewitt in the 2005 final to secure his second Grand Slam in five years. En route to this final, he defeated top-ranked Roger Federer in a five-set semifinal match. Safin described the match as &quot;a brain fight.&quot; He also defeated future ten-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic, who was making his first appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, in the first round losing just three games.

His best result at Wimbledon was reaching the semifinals in 2008, beating No. 3 Novak Djokovic en route. He often lost in the first or second rounds in other years, although he made the quarterfinals in 2001, losing in four sets to eventual champion Goran Ivanišević. Safin dismissed his performance in the 2001 tournament as a result of luck. Safin disliked playing on grass. Safin has said: &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to [break serve]. It&#x27;s difficult to play-off the baseline because [of] a lot of bad bounces.&quot; With Safin&#x27;s semifinal performance at Wimbledon in 2008, he became the fourth of five active players at the time to reach the semifinals in all four Grand Slams, joining Roger Federer, David Nalbandian, and Novak Djokovic. Other active players have since then joined the list.

=== Masters Series ===
Safin won five ATP Tennis Masters Series titles during his career. His first was in 2000 when he won the title in Toronto, Canada. He had three wins (2000, 2002, and 2004) in Paris, France, and one in 2004 in Madrid, Spain.

=== Tennis Masters Cup ===
In 2004, Safin reached the semifinal of the Tennis Masters Cup in Houston, Texas, where he was defeated by Federer, 6–3, 7–6(20–18). The second-set tiebreak (20–18) was the third-longest tiebreak in the Open Era. Safin also reached the semifinals in 2000.

=== Davis Cup ===
Safin helped Russia achieve its first Davis Cup victory in 2002, with a 3–2 tie-breaking win against France in the final round at the Palais Omnisports Paris Bercy. His Russian team included Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Mikhail Youzhny, Andrei Stoliarov, and captain Shamil Tarpischev. The team made Davis Cup history by being the second to win the event after losing the doubles tie-breaker, and becoming the first team to win a (live-televised) five-set finals match by coming back from a two-set deficit. Safin helped Russia to win the Davis Cup in 2006. After a straight-sets defeat by David Nalbandian in his first match, his doubles victory (partnering Dmitry Tursunov) against Nalbandian and Agustín Calleri and singles victory against José Acasuso drove Russia to victory.

In the 2009 Davis Cup quarterfinal tie, Russia was upset by the Israel Davis Cup team on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in Tel Aviv. Russia was the top-ranked country in Davis Cup standings, and the stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press: &quot;With all due respect, Israel was lucky to get to the quarterfinals.&quot; Safin was held out of the first day of singles, and then went on to lose the clinching doubles match in five sets partnered with doubles specialist Igor Kunitsyn.

=== Injury history ===

A succession of injuries hindered Safin&#x27;s progress throughout his career.

In 2003, he missed the majority of the season due to a wrist injury.

During the 2005 clay-court season, Safin suffered a knee injury, which he played through all the way up to Wimbledon with the help of pain killers and anti-inflammatories. Safin was subsequently defeated in the early rounds of each of the seven tournaments he played between the Australian Open and the French Open, culminating in an early round defeat at the French Open. Safin made a surprise finals appearance at the Wimbledon tune-up tournament in Halle on grass. He lost the final narrowly to the defending champion, Federer. He only played one tournament in the summer hard-court season, in Cincinnati, where he lost in the quarterfinals to Robby Ginepri. He also missed the Tennis Masters Cup.

Injuries continued to bother Safin in 2006. Although Safin made appearances at the 2006 ATP Masters tournaments at Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome and Hamburg, his ranking plummeted to as low as No. 104. He began to recover in time for the 2006 US Open, in which Safin defeated No. 4 David Nalbandian in a riveting second-round match. Safin then lost in the fourth round to No. 16 Tommy Haas, also in a fifth-set tiebreaker. Positive performances at the Thailand Open, where he was narrowly edged out by No. 7 seed, James Blake, and the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, the first all-Russian final at that event, losing to compatriot, Ukrainian-born Nikolay Davydenko, marked Safin&#x27;s recovery. Despite the injury, Safin still posted seven wins against top ten players in 2006, fourth-most on the ATP tour behind just Federer (19), Nadal (10), and Blake (8).

=== Later career ===
==== 2007 ====

Safin did not play any warm-up tournaments in the run-up to the Australian Open. As Safin was forced to miss the tournament in 2006 because of injury, 2007 was his first Australian Open since he captured the title in 2005. Safin lost against sixth seed Andy Roddick in his third-round match in a grueling 3-hour match. Roddick commented after the match, &quot;With Marat you know you are going to get an emotional roller-coaster. You just have to try and focus on yourself and I was able to do that tonight.

In April, Safin won the deciding quarterfinal Davis Cup rubber against France, beating Paul-Henri Mathieu in straight sets.

Safin reached the third round at Wimbledon, before falling to the defending champion Roger Federer. In July, Safin announced that he and his coach Alexander Volkov were parting ways, and that his new coach would be former pro Hernán Gumy. He won the doubles title at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow in October, his first ATP-level title since the 2005 Australian Open.

==== 2008 ====
At AAMI Kooyong Classic invitational in Melbourne, Safin beat Andy Murray before losing to Andy Roddick. In the third-place play-off, Safin beat Fernando González. At the Australian Open Safin beat Ernests Gulbis in straight sets but lost in the second round after a grueling five-set match against Baghdatis.

In February, Safin was granted wildcards into the tournaments at Memphis and Las Vegas. In Memphis, he was edged out by his 2002 Australian Open opponent, Thomas Johansson in the first round. In Las Vegas, he was defeated by Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals.

In March, Safin lost in the first round of Indian Wells and Miami, to Jürgen Melzer and qualifier Bobby Reynolds, respectively. In the Davis Cup between Russia and the Czech Republic, Safin defeated No. 9 Tomáš Berdych in a five-set encounter, after being two sets down. This was the first time in his career that he had come back to win a match after being down two sets.

Safin&#x27;s next tournament was in Valencia. He defeated No. 20-ranked Juan Carlos Ferrero. In spite of the fact that Ferrero is from the Valencia region, Safin was the more popular player, having been based in Valencia for many years and being a well-known Valencia CF fan. – local player Ferrero controversially favouring Real Madrid. He played Dutch teenager Robin Haase in the next round. He won the first set and was up 4–2 in the second set. However, Haase broke back to take it to a tiebreak. Safin had four match points, including one on his serve, but lost the tiebreak, and eventually the match. In the Monte Carlo Masters, Safin defeated Xavier Malisse, but then lost to No. 5 David Ferrer. At 2008 BMW Open in Munich, Germany, he beat Carlos Berlocq and Michael Berrer, but lost to Fernando González in his first quarterfinal of the year, and the first since June 2007 at Washington, D.C. Safin entered the 2008 French Open but was eliminated in the second round by countryman and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, in straight sets.

Ranked at No. 75, Safin entered the 2008 Wimbledon Championships, where he defeated Fabio Fognini in the first round. In the second round, he defeated No. 3 player and 2008 Australian Open Champion Novak Djokovic. Safin&#x27;s victory came as a shock as Djokovic was described as a &quot;serious contender&quot; to win the tournament. In the third round, he defeated Italian Andreas Seppi. In the fourth round, he defeated Stanislas Wawrinka. This was the first time he had reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam since the 2005 Australian Open. Safin went on to defeat Feliciano López in the quarterfinals to set up a semifinal clash with defending champion Roger Federer. His run to the semifinals was his best record in Wimbledon and made him the first Russian man to ever reach a Wimbledon semifinal. Safin attributed his great run at Wimbledon to the hard work he was putting in with coach Hernán Gumy. Safin then played at the Swedish Open, on clay, in Båstad beating Marc López, before losing his second-round match against Potito Starace.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.atptour.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Safin was awarded a wild card into the Rogers Cup Masters tournament in Toronto. He beat Sam Querrey in the first round. Because of rain delays, he had to play his next match against Stan Wawrinka on the same day. He lost that match. At the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles he defeated John Isner and Wayne Odesnik to advance to the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by Denis Gremelmayr.

At the US Open, Safin lost in the second round to Tommy Robredo. At the Moscow Kremlin Cup, he defeated Noam Okun, Julien Benneteau, Nikolay Davydenko, and Mischa Zverev, only to lose to another compatriot Igor Kunitsyn in the final. It was Safin&#x27;s first final appearance since 2006, in the same event. Following the Kremlin Cup, Safin withdrew from the Madrid Masters event with a shoulder injury. His next event was the St. Petersburg Open, at which he lost in the second round. He then lost his first-round match at the final ATP tournament of the calendar: the Paris Masters, to Juan Mónaco. In the post-match conference, he raised the possibility of his retirement from the sport. Via a message posted on his official website, he said he was going to take a holiday and then seriously consider his options regarding his future in tennis. He finished the year 2008 ranked at No. 29.

==== 2009 ====
Safin started the 2009 season by playing in the Hopman Cup event in Perth with his sister, Dinara Safina. He arrived at the event sporting a bandaged right thumb, two black eyes, a blood-filled left eye, and a cut near his right eye, all suffered in a fight several weeks earlier in Moscow. In the 2009 Hopman Cup, the pair played off in the final representing Russia, but each was defeated in the singles rubbers.

Safin withdrew from the Kooyong Classic tournament because of a shoulder injury, but recovered to play his first-round Australian Open match, which he won in straight sets over Iván Navarro of Spain. In the second round, Safin defeated another Spanish player, Guillermo García-López. In the third round, he came up against Federer and lost in straight sets. His next tournament was the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships. He exited in the first round, losing to Richard Gasquet, and lost in the semifinals in doubles partnering David Ferrer. In March, Safin helped Russia advance to the Davis Cup quarterfinals by beating Victor Crivoi of Romania in the first rubber in straight sets.

Starting the year at No. 29 in the world, he placed in the top 20 during the year for the first time since the end of January 2006. His doubles ranking also improved from 300 to 195. In the first round at Wimbledon, at which he was seeded 14th, he was upset by 21-year-old American Jesse Levine.

Safin played at the Catella Swedish Open at Båstad, where he lost to Nicolás Almagro of Spain. He began his hard-court season by making it to the quarterfinals of the LA Tennis Open (his first quarterfinal of the season), where he lost to Tommy Haas.

He lost in the first round of the U.S. Open, his last Grand Slam, to Austrian Jürgen Melzer. After a second-round loss in the PTT Thailand Open, he found some late form, coming into the China Open tournament held in Beijing; beating José Acasuso in the first round. In the second round, he played Fernando González and produced a win. In the quarterfinals, he lost against top seed Rafael Nadal. As the tour rolled into Moscow for the Kremlin Cup, it marked the beginning of the end for Safin, as he played his last competitive matches in his native Russia. He defeated No. 6 Nikolay Davydenko in the first round, but lost in the second round. He then played at the 2009 St. Petersburg Open, reaching the semifinals.

=== Retirement ===
Safin&#x27;s final tournament as a professional tennis player was at the 2009 Paris Masters. In the first round, he saved three match points with three aces against Thierry Ascione, eventually prevailing with a total of 24 aces and 41 winners. On 11 November 2009, Safin&#x27;s career ended with a second-round defeat by reigning US Open champion Juan Martín del Potro, after which a special presentation ceremony was held on Centre Court at Bercy. Fellow tennis players who joined him in the ceremony included Juan Martín del Potro, Novak Djokovic, Gilles Simon, Tommy Robredo, Frederico Gil, Ivo Karlović, Albert Costa, Marc Rosset, and Younes El Aynaoui.

== Playing style ==

Safin was often characterized as a powerful offensive baseliner. Boris Becker, in 1999, said that he had not seen anybody hit the ball as hard from both wings for &quot;a long, long time&quot;. He has a strong and accurate serve and a great forehand, while also possessing one of the best two-handed backhands of all time. He was also capable of playing at the net, with his volleys also being effective. However, lack of consistency and motivation was described as Safin&#x27;s ultimate weakness, starting after his victory at the 2005 Australian Open.

Safin generally dominated during the fast indoor hard/carpet season, which is usually during the last few weeks on tour; Safin considered grass to be his least favourite playing surface, despite the similarities between indoor courts and grass courts even though other opponents with similar playing styles generally dominate on it.

He is known as one of the most talented players ever during his time on the tour; however his career was hampered by persistent injuries and lack of determination that prevented the prolongation of his dominance, and is therefore agreed by many pundits and fans as one of the biggest underachievers in tennis.

Safin was also known for his emotional outbursts during matches, and smashed numerous rackets. Safin is estimated to have smashed 48 racquets in 1999. In 2011, Safin stated that during his career he broke 1055 racquets.

== Equipment ==
Safin has used the Head Prestige Classic 600 since 1997 however throughout the years sported numerous paintjobs of the latest Head Prestige rackets (i.e. intelligence, Liquidmetal, Flexpoint and Microgel). His racquets used to be strung using Babolat VS Natural Team Gut 17L gauge, but he then switched to Luxilon Big Banger Original at 62 to 67 pounds. His apparel was manufactured by Adidas and he was the figurehead of the &#x27;Competition&#x27; line from 2000 onward.

== Career statistics ==
=== Grand Slam tournament performance timeline ===
1&quot;At the 2003 Australian Open, Safin withdrew prior to the third round.&quot;

=== Grand Slam tournament finals: 4 (2 titles, 2 runner-ups) ===
== Post-retirement career ==
Since retirement Safin has been an official for the Russian Tennis Federation and a member of the Russian Olympic Committee. In 2011, he began playing at the ATP Champions Tour.

In December 2011, Safin was elected to the Russian Parliament as a member of Vladimir Putin&#x27;s United Russia Party, representing Nizhny Novgorod. On 25 May 2017, he voluntarily resigned from the position.

==Personal life==
In a 2008 interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Safin identified himself as a Muslim, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m Russian, but I&#x27;m 100% Muslim. All the Muslim people are passionate, stubborn. We have hot blood.&quot; However, ten years later in an interview for Alexander Golovin of Sports.Ru, he stated that although he believes something had created the world he doesn&#x27;t really believe in a personal God.

== Language ==
=== Yue Language ===
*Qin-Lian Yue&lt;br&gt;It is the mostly common vernacular languages group in Beihai, including old language (Limchownese Language and Nga Language) and new language (kinds accents of Cantonese).
**Limchownese Language&lt;br&gt;(), the name stemming from the Town of Lianzhou, the capital of County of Hepu, which was the central and capital town for several modern cities nearby in early history. Or Hoppo Language (), has been named by the County of Hepu, which was the major city in Gulf of Tonkin of ancient China. Or Rural Language (), literally speaking, the language was most widely used until the Cantonese and Tanka immigrants from the zone of Pearl River - capital district of Province of Guangdong with their Cantonese Language have been dominating South of Hepu - modern District of Haicheng, focal point of Beihai, where downtown has been moved to from Town of Lianzhou since 19th century after Chefoo Convention which demanded Beihai as a treaty port. Or Jute-planter Language (), whose name was from &#x27;jute-planter&#x27; () is used to describe the Limchownese-speaking people tend to broadly plant jute. The term is widely used in East of Hepu. Limchownese is mostly widely used in Beihai, and regarded as the first language and mother tongue by the most of native. People in County of Hepu and District of Yinhai only speak Limchownese as monolingual (only regional languages are listed, or as &#x27;dialects&#x27; regarded by Government of China, Mandarin that is national language of China isn&#x27;t counted here). However, citizens in District of Haicheng - the zone of chief administration mostly speak it as bilingual, Pakhoi Cantonese is more mainstream here, the elder are mostly proficient for the 2 languages, the young might only speak the latter and are mostly able to listen, understand and simulate the former language.
**Nga Language&lt;br&gt;(, literally &#x27;my language&#x27;) named by the pronunciation of &#x27;I&#x27; () /ŋa/, some call Maritime Language (), another elder speakers call Hoppo Language (), for distinguishing from sharing the same name of with Limchownese Language, they call Limchownese &#x27;Outer Language&#x27; (). Linguistically, Nga Language is closely related to Limchownese Language, sometimes regarded as a dialect of it. Nga Language is mostly spoken in District of Tieshangang, and some in District of Yinhai and Town of Zakou border on Tieshangang. Nga Language and Limchownese Language are able to be talked each other in some extent (approximately 50-60 percent and more), but a little confusion about understand and tone. And it&#x27;s easy to learn and simulate Limchownese for the people speaking Nga Language. Historical name for Tieshangang was &#x27;pearl pool&#x27; (), so the many ancient people who spoke this language called &#x27;the pearl fishers&#x27; () in historical information. The pearl played the most significant role in Beihai&#x27;s ancient history.
**Costal Language&lt;br&gt;(), also named Civilian Language () is spoken in Town of Shatian. This language is debatable Which language group it belongs to, sometimes it will be stated as Min Language. However, it shares many indigenous words with Limchownese Language and Nga Language.
**Pakhoi Cantonese&lt;br&gt;(, literally &#x27;vernacular of Beihai&#x27;), abbreviated as Pakhoi Language (), vernacular or Common Language (), the dialect of Cantonese, is the second most-spoken language in Beihai. After Cantonese and Tanka immigrants brought their language and culture while settled in Beihai in 19th century, it has been changed by the influence of native through time. &#x27;Limchownese-Cantonese&#x27; is the most appropriate term to explain it. Pakhoi Cantonese has experienced strong influence from Limchownese language, especially native conventional vocabularies and phrase different from Cantonese Language, some are originated from Kra–Dai languages without Chinese characters to write (sometimes meaningless homonyms are used to write), others are diverse or very rare Sintic words to use. And its pronunciations are also influenced, some Chinese characters each have 2 different pronunciations - Limchownese-Cantonese pronunciation and native Cantonese pronunciation, depending on their different vocabulary which means combining more than 2 characters (or words from Kra–Dai languages) to form a phrase. And some expressions have 2 different phrases - native Cantonese phrase and Limchownese phrase.
**Naamhong Cantonese (), is only spoken in the downtown of Town of Nankang. It is close to Pakhoi Cantonese but with an obviously different tone. However, the most widely used in Town of Nankang is Nga Language, mostly in hinterland.
*Cantonese varieties of mixed Yue&lt;br&gt;The local Cantonese accents of Beihai with native Qin-Lian Yue and Yuehai Yue (widely known as &#x27;Cantonese of Guangzhou&#x27;) mixed.
**Tanka Cantonese&lt;br&gt;() is spoken by Tanka People who are mostly living in Waishaqiao () the north bank of Beihai, some very elderly people speak in the absolute Tanka accent, the middle age and the young speak in mixed accents with Pakhoi Cantonese.
**Overseas-Chinese Cantonese&lt;br&gt;() is spoken by the people living in Town of Qiaogang, majorly consist of Chinese-vietnamese refugees expelled during the anti-China protest in Vietnam in 1975. Overseas-Chinese accents are complex, the minority speak in Cantonese accent or Tanka accent, the majority speak in a mixed accent with Pakhoi Cantonese or Limchownese Language.
**Saanhau Cantonese&lt;br&gt;() is only spoken in the downtown of Town of Shankou which is the border Province of Guangxi and Province of Guangdong. It is close to Guangzhou Cantonese.

=== Hakka Language ===
*West Guangdong-South Guangxi Hakka
**Ngai Language&lt;br&gt;(, literally &#x27;my language&#x27;) named by the pronunciation of &#x27;I&#x27; (Chinese: 我) /ŋai/, 涯 is the meaningless &#x27;borrowed characters&#x27; based on its similar pronunciation, or New-immigrants Language () is the third most-speaking language. It is linguistically divided as a dialect of Hakka Language, but some speakers distinguish themselves from Hakka (Because most of Ngai people consider that they don&#x27;t share a origins with Hakka people). The speakers mainly gather in several towns of Eastern Hepu and Weizhou Island (the mother tongue for about 60% islanders). Most of Ngai people&#x27;s ancestors moved from Dingzhou, Province of Fujian to Beihai during Ming and Qing dynasties.

=== Min Language ===
*Leizhou-Hainan Min
**Leizhou Min&lt;br&gt;() is rare in Beihai and only used in some villages of Tieshangang and Weizhou Island (the mother tongue for about 15% islanders). The speakers are descendants of Immigrants from Leizhou. Weizhou Island was governed by District of Leizhou, then was transferred to Hepu (including nowaday Beihai).
**Bomei Language&lt;br&gt;() is a dialect of Min language, only spoken by very small people living around Beihai Fucheng Airport. The speakers are mostly descendants of the Immigrants from Dianbai.
*Eastern Min
**Army Language&lt;br&gt;() is a dialect of Eastern Min, spoken in Village of Yongan, East of Hepu, which was a historical military zone in ancient China. The language as literally was brought by army from Province of Fujian.

=== Others ===
Mandarin is of increasing prevalence as a result of the Chinese government&#x27;s general promotion of it.

<text>Decimus Caelius Calvinus Balbinus (died 238 AD) was Roman emperor with Pupienus for three months in 238, the Year of the Six Emperors.

== Origins and career ==
Not much is known about Balbinus before his elevation to emperor. It has been conjectured that he descended from Publius Coelius Balbinus Vibullius Pius, the consul ordinarius of 137, and wife Aquilia. If this were true, he was also related to the family of Q. Pompeius Falco, which supplied many politicians of consular rank throughout the 3rd century, and to the 1st-century politician, engineer and author Julius Frontinus. He was born around 178. He was a patrician from birth, and was the son (either by birth or adoption) of Caelius Calvinus, who was legate of Cappadocia in 184. He was one of the Salii priests of Mars. According to Herodian he had governed provinces, but the list of seven provinces given in the unreliable &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, as well as the statement that Balbinus had been both Proconsul of Asia and of Africa, are likely to be mere invention. He had certainly been twice consul; his first consulate is not certainly known but is believed to have been about 203 or in July 211; he was consul for the second time in 213 as colleague of Caracalla, which suggests he enjoyed that emperor&#x27;s favour.

== Reign ==
According to Edward Gibbon (drawing upon the narratives of Herodian and the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;):

Balbinus was an admired orator, a poet of distinguished fame, and a wise magistrate, who had exercised with innocence and applause the civil jurisdiction in almost all the interior provinces of the empire. His birth was noble, his fortune affluent, his manners liberal and affable. In him, the love of pleasure was corrected by a sense of dignity, nor had the habits of ease deprived him of a capacity for business. (...) The two colleagues [Pupienus and Balbinus] had both been consul (Balbinus had twice enjoyed that honourable office), both had been named among the twenty lieutenants of the senate; and, since the one was sixty and the other seventy-four years old, they had both attained the full maturity of age and experience.

On the news of the Gordians&#x27; defeat, the Senate voted Pupienus and Balbinus as co-emperors in April 238, though they were soon forced to co-opt the child Gordian III as a colleague. Unlike the situation in 161, both emperors were elected as &quot;pontifices maximi&quot;, chief priests of the official cults. This would be unthinkable in Republican times. Balbinus was probably in his early seventies: his qualifications for rule are unknown, except presumably that he was a senior senator, rich and well-connected. While Pupienus marched to Ravenna, where he oversaw the campaign against Maximinus, Balbinus remained in Rome, but failed to keep public order. The sources suggest that after Pupienus&#x27;s victorious return following Maximinus&#x27; death, Balbinus and Pupienus began to distrust each other. They were soon assassinated by disaffected elements of the Praetorian Guard; Pupienus attempted to warn Balbinus of the plot, but the latter thought that the guard would instead secure the throne for himself.

== Sarcophagus ==
The &#x27;sarcophagus of Balbinus&#x27; has earned this Emperor a niche in the history of Roman Imperial art. Presumably while holding the title of Emperor, Balbinus had a marble sarcophagus made for himself and his wife (whose name is unknown). Discovered in fragments near the Via Appia and restored, this is the only example of a Roman Imperial sarcophagus of this type to have survived. On the lid are reclining figures of Balbinus and his wife, the figure of the Emperor also being a fine portrait of him. The sarcophagus is held in collection at the &quot;Museo di Pretastato&quot; (at the catacombs of Praetextatus) in the Park of the Caffarella near the Appian Way at Rome.

Although in accounts of their joint reign Balbinus is emphasized as the civilian as against Pupienus the military man, on the side of the sarcophagus he is portrayed in full military dress.

<text>Marcus Clodius Pupienus Maximus ( 164–238) was Roman emperor with Balbinus for 99 days in 238, during the Year of the Six Emperors. The sources for this period are scant, and thus knowledge of the emperor is limited. In most contemporary texts he is referred to by his cognomen &quot;Maximus&quot; rather than by his second nomen (family name) Pupienus ().

==Origins and early career==

The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, whose testimony is not to be trusted unreservedly, paints Pupienus as an example of advancement through the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; due to military success. It claims he was the son of a blacksmith, was adopted by one Pescennia Marcellina (otherwise unknown), and who started his career as a &quot;Centurio&quot; &quot;primus pilus&quot; before becoming a tribunus militum, and then a praetor. Pupienus&#x27;s career was allegedly impressive, serving a number of important posts during the reign of the Severan dynasty throughout the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. This included assignment as Proconsul of the senatorial propraetorial provinces of Bithynia et Pontus, Achaea, and Gallia Narbonensis.

In fact Pupienus was part of the aristocracy, albeit a minor member, and his family had possibly been elevated only recently. Hailing from the Etruscan city of Volterra, it has been speculated that Pupienus was the son of Marcus Pupienus Maximus, a senator who was the first member of his family to enter the Senate, and wife Clodia Pulchra.

The claim in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; that Pupienus held three praetorian proconsular governorships is unlikely. For one thing, as Bernard Rémy points out, during Pupienus&#x27; lifetime the province of Bithynia et Pontus was an imperial one, governed by an imperial &quot;legatus&quot;. Remy points out another problem: that being awarded three praetorian proconsular governorships violates what is known of Roman practice, and lacks any similar cases. Remy pointedly quotes the opinion of André Chastagnol, who recommended &quot;to admit an information provided by the &quot;Augustan History&quot; only if it is confirmed by another document&quot; and considers that, faced with such an unreliable source, one must permit &quot;methodical doubt and hypercritical attitude to prevail.&quot;

After his consulship (around the year 222), his &quot;cursus honorum&quot; is much more reliable. Pupienus was later assigned as imperial legate to one of the German provinces, most probably after his first suffect consulship, circa 207 AD. While governor he scored military victories over the Sarmatians and German tribes. At some point after he concluded his duties in the German province, the sortition awarded him proconsular governorship of Asia.

In 234, during the last years of Severus Alexander&#x27;s reign, he was installed as consul for the second time. In that same year he was also appointed Urban Prefect of Rome and gained a reputation for severity, to the extent that he became unpopular with the Roman mob.

==Reign==

When Gordian I and his son were proclaimed emperors in Africa, the Senate appointed a committee of twenty men, including the elderly senator Pupienus, to co-ordinate operations against Maximinus Thrax until the arrival of the Gordians. On the news of the Gordians&#x27; defeat and deaths, however, the Senate met in closed session in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and voted for two members of the committee to be installed as co-emperors: Pupienus and Balbinus. Unlike the situation in 161, both emperors were elected as &quot;pontifices maximi&quot;, chief priests of the official cults.

According to Edward Gibbon (drawing on the narratives of Herodian and the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;), the choice was sensible, as:

the mind of Maximus [Pupienus] was formed in a rougher mould [than that of Balbinus]. By his valour and abilities he had raised himself from the meanest origin to the first employments of the state and army. His victories over the Sarmatians and the Germans, the austerity of his life, and the rigid impartiality of his justice whilst he was prefect of the city, commanded the esteem of a people whose affections were engaged in favour of the more amiable Balbinus. The two colleagues had both been consul... and, since the one was sixty and the other seventy-four years old, they had both attained the full maturity of age and experience.
However, factions within the Senate who had hoped to profit from the accession of the Gordians manipulated the people and the Praetorian Guard to agitate for the elevation of Gordian III as their imperial colleague. Leaving his senior colleague Balbinus in charge of the civil administration at Rome, sometime during late April, Pupienus marched to Ravenna, where he oversaw the campaign against Maximinus, recruiting German auxiliary troops who had served under him whilst he was in Germania. After Maximinus was assassinated by his soldiers just outside Aquileia, Pupienus dispatched both Maximinus&#x27; troops and his own back to their provinces (along with a considerable donative) and returned to Rome with his newly acquired German bodyguard.

Balbinus, in the meantime, had failed to keep public order in the capital. The sources suggest that Balbinus suspected Pupienus of using his German bodyguard to supplant him, and they were soon living in different parts of the Imperial palace. This meant that they were at the mercy of disaffected elements in the Praetorian Guard, who resented serving under Senate-appointed emperors, and now plotted to kill them. Pupienus, becoming aware of the threat, begged Balbinus to call for the German bodyguard. Balbinus, believing that this news was part of a plot by Pupienus to have him assassinated, refused, and the two began to argue just as the Praetorians burst into the room. Both emperors were seized and dragged back to the Praetorian barracks where they were tortured and hacked to death in the bath house. They only ruled 99 days.

==Family==
Three individuals have been identified as his children. Titus Clodius Pupienus Pulcher Maximus, &quot;consul suffectus&quot; c. 235, and patron of the town of Tibur outside Rome, has been identified as his oldest son. Marcus Pupienus Africanus Maximus, &quot;consul ordinarius&quot; in 236 as the colleague of the Emperor Maximinus Thrax, has been identified as his youngest son. These consulships in the family, across the reigns of Severus Alexander and Maximinus Thrax, suggest that the family was influential and in high favour. Pupienus also had a daughter, named Pupiena Sextia Paulina Cethegilla, wife of Marcus Ulpius Eubiotus Leurus.

<doc id="383488" wikidata="Q1934666" url="?curid=383488" title="Ron Hardy">
<text>Ron Hardy (May 8, 1958 – March 2, 1992) was an American, Chicago, Illinois-based DJ and record producer of early house music. He is well known for playing records at the Muzic Box, a Chicago house music club. Decades after his death, he is recognized for his innovative edits and mixes of disco, soul music, funk and early house music.

==Early career==
Hardy started his career in 1974 in Chicago&#x27;s gay club Den One. Here, with a set-up of two turntables, a mixer and a reel-to-reel tape-deck, he played long nights of underground dance music. Around 1977, he went to work in Los Angeles. At the end of 1982, when DJ Frankie Knuckles left the Warehouse to open the Power Plant, Ron Hardy DJed at the Warehouse&#x27;s new location until Robert Williams renamed it &quot;The Music Box.&quot; Producer Chip E. introduced Hardy to recording music in 1986 when the two mixed &quot;Donnie&quot; by The It (featuring Chip E., Larry Heard, Robert Owens, and Harri Dennis). From humble beginnings, Hardy&#x27;s contributions to house music are considered influential.

==Mixing style==
While Frankie Knuckles at the Warehouse (and later the Power Plant) had a smooth style of playing, Hardy had less regard for sound quality and would play with a manic energy, mixing everything from classic Philadelphia disco classics, Italo disco imports to new wave, disco and rock tracks. Hardy also pitched records up way more than Knuckles (pitch being the difference between normal speed and the speed at which the record is currently playing. Usually expressed as + or -, with 8 being maximum/minimum). Techno artist Derrick May remembers hearing Hardy playing a Stevie Wonder cut with the speed at +8.

Hardy&#x27;s style incorporated constant tension met with release, with a pulsing narrative that enchanted the wild crowds of the Music Box. In contrast to Frankie Knuckles, Hardy&#x27;s mark on house music was endless energy and using a variety of techniques to keep the audience on their toes. Most notably, when Hardy was playing at the Music Box, it was guaranteed to be loud, as evidenced by first-hand recollections of what a night there felt like: &quot;The Music Box was so loud that anywhere in the club, the bass would physically move you-not just on the dancefloor, but &quot;anywhere&quot; in the club!&quot; All of these factors, including Hardy&#x27;s own emotional investment in the music, created an intense atmosphere on the dance floor.

==Trademarks==
Hardy played a lot of reel-to-reel edits and was always tweaking the soundsystem and playing with the EQ. A Ron Hardy trademark was playing a track backwards. Theo Parrish and several others have said that he did this by turning the needle upside down and putting the record on a cylinder so the needle played the underside of the record, although Stacey Collins says that he did this by using a reel-to-reel. Hardy&#x27;s residence-club The Music Box was also known for its loud sound.

==Favorite song selections in early 1980s==
Hardy opened his nights with &quot;Welcome to the Pleasuredome&quot; by Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Among the classic disco that was a staple in Chicago clubs at the time, typical tracks one could also hear him play were Visage - &quot;Frequency 7&quot;, Klein &amp; MBO - &quot;Dirty Talk&quot;, ESG - &quot;Moody&quot;, Patrick Adams - &quot;Big Phreek&quot;, Liquid Liquid - &quot;Optimo&quot;, First Choice - &quot;Let No Man Put Asunder&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;, Eurythmics - &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and Talk Talk - &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;. Hardy also played electronic body music acts like Nitzer Ebb.

==Beginnings of Chicago house==
In the first half of the 1980s, many Chicago DJs and clubgoers started experimenting with creating their own rhythm tracks. DJs would play these homemade tracks, and subsequently, house music was born in Chicago. Hardy would often get the hottest acetates and tapes. Chicago producers, including Marshall Jefferson, Larry Heard, Adonis, Phuture&#x27;s DJ Pierre and Chip E., all debuted a lot of their compositions at The Muzic Box. When DJ Pierre and his friends Herb and Spanky created a weird squelching rhythm track from a Roland TB 303 bassline machine, they gave this track to Hardy. The first time he played it, the dancers left the floor. Hardy played the track three more times that night, and by the fourth time the audience was going crazy. The track became known as &quot;Acid Tracks&quot;, and released under the band name Phuture.

Hardy played a lot of the same tracks his DJ peers in Chicago played. However his combative DJ style, loud volume, experimentation with new music and the general atmosphere of The Music Box makes him to be considered a pioneer in the house music genre. Hardy continued a successful DJ-residency at The Music Box until the end of the 1980s and quickly changed his playlist to encompass more and more house music.

==Later life and death==
In 1987, a city law requiring after-hours clubs to close nightly at the same time as bars (which has since been rescinded) was passed. The Music Box closed that year. After the closure of the club, Hardy continued to DJ at various events around Chicago. He also battled with heroin addiction. He died of an AIDS-related illness on March 2, 1992.

In 2004, two bootleg 12&quot; records were released with &quot;Ron&#x27;s edits&quot; and in 2005, Partehardy Records, run by his nephew Bill released authentic edits not heard in over 20 years. There is also another bootleg series of edits called &quot;Music Box&quot;, containing either genuine Hardy re-edits or tributes by other DJs imitating his editing style. DJ Theo Parrish also made a series of tribute-remixes called &quot;Ugly Edits&quot; some of which bear a striking resemblance to Hardy&#x27;s re-edits. These have been bootlegged too. Some of DJ Harvey&#x27;s Black Cock edits records are tributes to Hardy&#x27;s edits as well.

In addition to his DJ mixes, long-buried original productions have also come to light—among them, &quot;Throwback 87&quot;, a collaboration between Ron Hardy and Gene Hunt.

Ron Hardy has a section dedicated to him on the second DVD of the DJ documentary &quot;Maestro&quot;.

<text>The Messerschmitt Bf 110, often known unofficially as the Me 110, is a twin-engined (destroyer, heavy fighter), fighter-bomber (&quot;Jagdbomber&quot; or &quot;Jabo&quot;), and night fighter (&quot;Nachtjäger&quot;) designed by the German aircraft company Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) and produced by successor company Messerschmitt. It was primarily operated by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and was active throughout the Second World War.

Development of the Bf 110 commenced during the first half of the 1930s; one early proponent of the type was Hermann Göring, who believed its heavy armament, speed, and range would make it the premier offensive fighter of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Early variants were armed with a pair of MG FF 20 mm cannon, four 7.92 mm (.323 in) MG 17 machine guns, and one 7.92 mm (.323 in) MG 15 machine gun for defence (later variants would replace the MG FFs with MG 151s and the rear gunner station would be armed with the twin-barreled MG 81Z). Development work on an improved type to replace the Bf 110 - the Messerschmitt Me 210 - began before the conflict started, but its shakedown troubles resulted in the Bf 110 soldiering on until the end of the war in various roles. Its intended replacements, the aforementioned Me 210 and the significantly improved Me 410 &quot;Hornisse&quot;, never fully replaced the Bf 110.

The Bf 110 served with considerable success in the early campaigns in Poland, Norway, and France. The primary weakness of the Bf 110 was its lack of manoeuvrability, although this could be mitigated with better tactics. This weakness was exploited by the RAF, when Bf 110s were flown as close escort to German bombers during the Battle of Britain. When British bombers began targeting German territory with nightly raids, some Bf 110-equipped units were converted to night fighters, a role to which the aircraft was well suited. After the Battle of Britain, the Bf 110 enjoyed a successful period as an air superiority fighter and strike aircraft in other theatres and defended Germany from strategic air attack by day against the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF)&#x27;s Eighth Air Force, until an American change in fighter tactics rendered them increasingly vulnerable to developing American air supremacy over the Reich as 1944 began.

During the Balkans and North African campaigns and on the Eastern Front, the Bf 110 rendered valuable ground support to the German Army as a potent fighter-bomber. Later in the conflict, it was developed into a formidable radar-equipped night fighter, becoming the principal night-fighting aircraft of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The majority of the German night fighter aces flew the Bf 110 at some point during their combat careers and the top night fighter ace, Major Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer, flew it exclusively and claimed 121 victories in 164 sorties. In addition to its use by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, other operators of the type included the Hungarian Air Force, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;, and the Romanian Air Force.

==Design and development==

===Genesis and competition===

Throughout the 1930s, the air forces of many major military powers were engaged in a transition from biplane to monoplane designs. Most concentrated on the single-engined fighter aircraft, but the problem of range arose. The Ministry of Aviation (RLM, for &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot;), at the encouragement of Hermann Göring, issued a request for a new multipurpose fighter called the &quot;Kampfzerstörer&quot; (battle destroyer) with long range and an internal bomb bay. This request called for a twin-engined, three-seat, all-metal monoplane that was armed with cannon and a bomb bay. Of the seven companies approached, only Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (which later became &quot;Messerschmitt&quot;), Focke-Wulf, and Henschel responded to the request.

The Focke-Wulf design, the Focke-Wulf Fw 57, had a wingspan of 25.6 m (84 ft) and was powered by a pair of DB 600 engines. It was armed with two 20 mm MG FF cannons in the nose, while a third was positioned in a dorsal turret. The Fw 57 V1 flew in 1936, but its performance was poor and the machine crashed. The Henschel Hs 124 was similar in construction layout to the Fw 57, equipped with two Jumo 210C for the V1. The V2 used the BMW 132Dc radial engines generating 870 PS compared with the 640 PS Jumo. The armament consisted of a single rearward-firing 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine gun and a single forward-firing 20 mm MG FF cannon.

Bayerische Flugzeugwerke omitted the internal bomb load requirement from the RLM directive to increase the armament element of the RLM&#x27;s specification. The Bf 110 proved to be far superior to its rivals in providing the speed, range, and firepower to meet its role requirements. Accordingly, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke&#x27;s submission bested Focke-Wulf, Henschel, and Arado, and thus the firm was given the funds to build several prototype aircraft. By the end of 1935, the Bf 110 had evolved into an all-metal, low-wing cantilever monoplane of semimonocoque design featuring twin vertical stabilizers and powered by two DB 600A engines. The design was also fitted with Handley-Page wing slots (actually, leading-edge slats).

===Early variants===

By luck (and pressure by Ernst Udet), the RLM reconsidered the ideas of the &quot;Kampfzerstörer&quot; and began focusing on the &quot;Zerstörer&quot;. Due to these changes, the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke design better fit the Ministry&#x27;s requests. On 12 May 1936, Rudolf Opitz flew the first Bf 110 from Augsburg. As many pre-war designs found, the engine technologies promised were of insufficient reliability. Even with the temperamental DB 600 engines, the RLM found that the Bf 110, while not as manoeuvrable as desired, was rather faster than its original request specified, as well as faster than the front-line fighter, the Bf 109 B-1. The order for four pre-production A-0 units was promptly placed, the first of which was delivered in January 1937. Amid this phase of testing, both the Focke-Wulf Fw 187 and Henschel Hs 124 competitors were rejected and the Bf 110 was ordered into full rate production.

The initial deliveries of the Bf 110 encountered several delays with their DB 600 engines, which forced Bayerische Flugzeugwerke to install Junkers Jumo 210B engines, leaving the Bf 110 seriously underpowered and able to reach a top speed of only 431 km/h (268 mph). The armament of the A-0 units was also limited to four nose-mounted 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns. Even without delivery of the DB 600 engines, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke began assembly of the Bf 110 in mid-1937. As the DB 600 engines continued to have problems, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke was forced to keep on using Jumo motors, the 210G, which supplied 515 kW (700 PS) each (versus the 471 kW/640 PS supplied by the 210B). Three versions of the Bf 110B were built, the B-1, which had four 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns and two 20 mm MG FF cannons, the B-2 reconnaissance version, which had a camera in place of the cannons and the B-3, which was used as a trainer, with the cannons replaced by extra radio equipment. Only 45 Bf 110Bs were built before the Jumo 210G engine production line ended. The major identifier of the -A and -B-series Bf 110s was the very large &quot;mouth&quot; bath radiators located under each engine.

In late 1938, the DB 601 B-1 engines became available in quantity, and thus were promptly adopted on the Bf 110C. In the adoption of this engine, the design teams opted to remove the radiators under the engine nacelles and replace them with water/glycol radiators for the C-series airframes, placing them under the wing just outboard of each nacelle, otherwise similar in installation, appearance and function to those on the Bf 109E. With the DB 601 engine, the Bf 110&#x27;s maximum speed increased to with a range around . A compact oil cooler and air scoop remained under each engine nacelle for the remainder of the Bf 110&#x27;s production run.
First conceived in the latter half of 1939, the Bf 110D featured a series of modifications and improvements that were focused on increasing its range. The initial D-series version, the Bf 110D-0 was designed to add a large, streamlined, 1,050-litre (277 U.S. gallon) ventral fuel tank built under the fuselage, which required a substantially sized, conformal streamlined ventral fuselage fairing extending from halfway back under the nose to the rear of the cockpit glazing, inspiring the nickname &quot;Dackelbauch&quot; (dachshund&#x27;s belly). The D-1 was also set up to accept a pair of fin-equipped 900-litre (238 U.S. gallon) drop tanks, one under each wing, increasing the total fuel capacity to 4,120 litres (1,088 U.S. gallons). The substantial added drag of the early &quot;dachshund&#x27;s belly&quot; ventral fuselage tank in test flights mandated its omission from production D-1s, although they were still prepared to mount an improved, better-streamlined, version. D-1s so equipped were known as D-1/R1, whereas the D-1/R2 was equipped with two 900-litre drop tanks and a droppable 85-litre oil tank. Later D-2 and D-3 versions retained the twin underwing 900-litre drop tank capability, using multipurpose ordnance racks capable of holding either drop tanks or carrying bombs.

===Later production variants===

The production of the Bf 110 was put on a low priority in 1941 in expectation of its replacement by the Me 210. During this time, two versions of the Bf 110 were developed, the E and F models. The E was designed as a fighter bomber (&quot;Zerstörer Jabo&quot;), able to carry four 50 kg (110 lb) ETC 50 racks under the wing, along with the centreline ETC 500 bomb rack. The first E, the Bf 110 E-1 was originally powered by the DB 601B engine, but shifted to the DB 601P as they became available in quantity. In total, 856 Bf 110E models were built between August 1940 and January 1942. The E models also had upgraded armour and some fuselage upgrades to support the added weight. Most pilots of the Bf 110E considered the aircraft slow and unresponsive, with one former Bf 110 pilot commenting the E was &quot;rigged and a total dog.&quot;

The Bf 110F featured the new DB 601F engines, which produced 993 kW/1,350 PS (almost double the power the original Jumo engines provided), which allowed for upgraded armour, strengthening, and increased weight with no loss in performance. Three common versions of the F model existed. Pilots typically felt the Bf 110F to be the best of the Bf 110 line, being fully aerobatic and in some respects smoother to fly than the Bf 109, though not as fast. Eventually, 512 Bf 110F models were completed between December 1941 and December 1942, when production gave way to the Bf 110G.

====Bf 110G production details====

Although the Me 210 entered service in mid-1941, it was plagued with problems and was withdrawn from service for further development. In the wake of the failure of the Me 210, the Bf 110G was designed. The G model was fitted with DB 605B engines, producing 1,085 kW (1,475 PS) at their &quot;Notleistung&quot; (war emergency) top-level setting, and 997 kW (1,355 PS) at 5.8 km (19,000 ft) altitude. The Bf 110G also had upgraded nose armament, and underwent some changes which improved the aerodynamics of the aircraft. The rear cockpit access was moved forward from the transversely-hinged, &quot;tilt-open&quot; rearmost canopy glazing to a side/top hinged opening section of the main canopy, opening to port, with a new rearmost framed glazing section fixed in place. No Bf 110 G-1 existed, so the Bf 110 G-2 became the baseline Bf 110G. A large number of &quot;Rüstsätze&quot; field conversion packs were available, making the G subtype the most versatile production version of the Bf 110.

The initial batch of six preseries production G-0 aircraft built in June 1942 were followed by 797 G-2, 172 G-3 and 2,293 of the night fighter-dedicated, three-seater G-4 models; built between December 1942 and April 1945. Pilots reported the Bf 110G to be a &quot;mixed bag&quot; in the air, in part due to all changes between the G and F series. The Bf 110G was considered a superior gun platform with excellent all-around visibility, and considered, until the advent of the Heinkel He 219, to be one of the best night fighters flown by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

===Armament===
The Bf 110&#x27;s main strength was its ability to mount unusually powerful air-to-air weaponry. Early versions had four 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns in the upper nose and two 20 mm MG FF/M cannons fitted in the lower part of the nose. Later versions replaced the MG FF/M with the more powerful 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons and many G-series aircraft, especially those which served in the bomber-destroyer role, had two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannons fitted instead of the MG 17. The defensive armament initially consisted of a single, flexibly mounted 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 15 machine gun. Late F-series and prototype G-series were upgraded to a 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 81 machine gun with a higher rate of fire, and the G-series was equipped with the twin-barreled MG 81Z. Many G-series night fighters were retrofitted or factory-built with the &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; off-bore gun system, which fired upward at an oblique angle for shooting down bombers while passing underneath; it was frequently equipped with two 20 mm MG FF/M, but field installations of the 20 mm MG 151/20 or 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannons were also used. The &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; weapons were typically mounted immediately in front of the rear cockpit.

The Bf 110 G-2/R1 was also capable of employing armament such as the &quot;Bordkanone&quot;-series 37 mm (1.46 in) BK 3,7 autofed cannon, mounted in a conformal ventral gun pod under the fuselage. A single hit from this weapon was usually enough to destroy any Allied bomber.

The initial Bf 110 C-1/B fighter-bomber could carry two 250 kg (551 lb), two 500 kg (1,102 lb), or two 1,000 kg (2,204 lb) bombs on two ETC 500 racks under the fuselage and, starting with the Bf 110 E-0, could be supplemented by four additional 50 kg (110 lb) bombs on ETC 50 racks under the wing.

===Night fighter===
After a period of use on bombing and reconnaissance, the type found its niche during the winter of 1940-41 as a night fighter in defensive operations. At first, the three main crew members had no special equipment for night operations and relied on their eyes alone to find enemy aircraft in the dark. Ground-controlled interception began from mid 1941 and the Bf 110 began to take its toll on RAF bombers and was soon an aircraft to be feared. Airborne radar was used experimentally during 1941, effective up to a maximum distance of 3.5 km/ 2.2 miles and capable of bringing the Bf 110 to within 200 m/655 ft of a target. However, its effectiveness varied massively during the latter half of the conflict as a result of Allied countermeasures and German radar advances alike.

Becoming active around July 1942, the Bf 110F-4 was the first version to be designed specifically as a night fighter. It was something of a stop-gap measure, though armed with four 7.92mm/ 0.31 in machine guns and two 20 mm / 0.78 in cannon. The Bf 110 remained the principal night fighter of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; through to 1944.

==Surviving aircraft==

Two intact Bf 110s are known to exist:

;Messerschmitt Bf 110 G &quot;Werk Nr.&quot; 730301

This aircraft is displayed as fully assembled at the Royal Air Force Museum&#x27;s London site at Hendon, North London. A G-series night fighter, it was likely built in 1944. It served with &quot;Nachtjagdgeschwader 3&quot;, the unit responsible for the night air defence of Denmark and North Germany until Germany&#x27;s surrender in May 1945.
It was one of five Bf 110s taken by the British for technical evaluation. In 1946, it was selected for preservation by the Air Historical Branch. It was eventually moved to the RAF Museum in 1978, where it has remained ever since.

;Messerschmitt Bf 110 F2 &quot;Werk Nr.&quot; 5052
Displayed at the Deutsches Technikmuseum Berlin.

Additionally, the Technik Museum Speyer preserves the wings and other parts from a Bf 110 that were recovered from a lake in Sweden in 1995. During the war, the aircraft landed on the frozen lake after being damaged by Swedish anti-aircraft fire.

Messerschmitt Bf 110 G4 (unknown Werk Nr.)
This aircraft is made from a wide range of original spare parts found all over the world. It is currently owned and displayed by a private foundation in Denmark.

<text>Hypospadias is a common malformation in fetal development of the penis in which the urethra does not open from its usual location on the head of the penis. It is the second-most common birth defect of the male reproductive system, affecting about one of every 250 males at birth, although when including milder cases, is found in up to 4% of newborn males. Roughly 90% of cases are the less serious distal hypospadias, in which the urethral opening (the meatus) is on or near the head of the penis (glans). The remainder have proximal hypospadias, in which the meatus is all the way back on the shaft of the penis, near or within the scrotum. Shiny tissue or anything that typically forms the urethra instead extends from the meatus to the tip of the glans; this tissue is called the urethral plate.

In most cases, the foreskin is less developed and does not wrap completely around the penis, leaving the underside of the glans uncovered. Also, a downward bending of the penis, commonly referred to as chordee, may occur. Chordee is found in 10% of distal hypospadias and 50% of proximal hypospadias cases at the time of surgery. Also, the scrotum may be higher than usual on either side of the penis (called penoscrotal transposition).

The cause of hypospadias is unknown; scientists have investigated both genetic and environmental mechanisms, such as prenatal hormones. Another model suggests hypospadias arises as a result of unerased epigenetic markers which canalize sexual development. It most often occurs by itself, without other variations, although in about 10% of cases it may be part of disorder of sex development condition or a medical syndrome with multiple abnormalities.

The most common associated difference is an undescended testicle, which has been reported in around 3% of infants with distal hypospadias and 10% with proximal hypospadias. The combination of hypospadias and an undescended testicle sometimes indicates a child has a difference of sex development condition, so additional testing may be recommended to make sure the child does not have congenital adrenal hyperplasia with or a similar condition where immediate medical intervention is needed. Otherwise no blood tests or X-rays are routinely needed in newborns with hypospadias.

Hypospadias can be a symptom or indication of a difference in sex development, but some consider that the presence of hypospadias alone is not enough to classify someone as a person with a difference/variation in sex development or as intersex. In most cases, hypospadias is not associated with any other condition. Hypospadias is sometimes considered as an intersex condition by several intersex rights activist groups, who consider the repositioning of a working urethra on a child too young to consent to be a human rights violation.

==Presentation==

A penis with hypospadias usually has a characteristic appearance. Not only is the meatus (urinary opening) lower than usual, but the foreskin is also often only partially developed, lacking the usual amount that would cover the glans on the underside, causing the glans to have a hooded appearance. However, newborns with partial foreskin development do not necessarily have hypospadias, as some have a meatus in the usual place with a hooded foreskin, called &quot;chordee without hypospadias&quot;.

In other cases, the foreskin (prepuce) is typical and the hypospadias is concealed. This is called &quot;megameatus with intact prepuce&quot;. The condition is discovered during newborn circumcision or later in childhood when the foreskin begins to retract. A newborn with typical-appearing foreskin and a straight penis who is discovered to have hypospadias after the start of circumcision can have circumcision completed without concern for jeopardizing hypospadias repair.

===Complications===
There is noted to be an increase in erectile problems in people with hypospadias, particularly when associated with a chordee (down curving of the shaft). There is usually minimal interaction with ability to ejaculate in hypospadias providing the meatus remains distal. This can also be affected by the coexistence of posterior urethral valves. There is an increase in difficulties associated with ejaculation, however, including increased rate of pain on ejaculation and weak/dribbling ejaculation. The rates of these problems are the same regardless of whether or not the hypospadias is surgically corrected.

== Cause ==

=== Genes and prenatal hormones ===
Hypospadias is present at birth, although the cause of hypospadias remains unknown. The influence of genes and the intrauterine environment have been proposed. Sexual differentiation of males and female fetuses occurs under the influence of prenatal sex hormones. In humans, the development of external genitalia occurs in during an early hormone independent phase (5 to 8 weeks of gestation) and a later hormone dependent stage (weeks 8 to 12). One hypothesis proposes that atypical androgen exposure, or interference in the differentiation process, produces hypospadias.

=== Epigenetic inheritance hypothesis ===
When one identical twin is born with hypospadias, his identical twin also has the trait only 25% of the time, despite sharing their genes and prenatal hormonal environment. Animal studies have found that androgen antagonists during early fetal development cause elevated rates of hypospadias and cryptorchidism, however, in humans these traits rarely occur together. In addition, levels of circulating testosterone overlap for both male and female fetuses throughout fetal development. Rice et al. have proposed that sexually dimorphic development occurs through epigenetic markers which are laid down during stem cell development, which blunt androgen signalling in XX fetuses, and boost sensitivity in XY fetuses. If this marks are sexually antagonistic, and if a subset of these epigenetic marks carry over generations, they are expected to produce mosaicism of sexual development in opposite-sex offspring, sometimes producing hypospadias or cryptorchidism when passed from a mother to son (feminizing the external genitalia). Two small sample studies in 2012 and 2013 found changes in the transcriptome and methylome of hypospadias patients. A 2022 study found additional evidence of atypical epigenetic methylation in foreskin tissue of hypospadias patients. Rice&#x27;s model requires further testing with currently available technology to support or falsify it.

==Treatment==

Where hypospadias is seen as a genital ambiguity in a child, the World Health Organization standard of care is to delay surgery until the child is old enough to participate in informed consent, unless emergency surgery is needed because the child lacks a urinary opening. Hypospadias is not a serious medical condition. A urinary opening that is not surrounded by glans tissue is more likely to &quot;spray&quot; the urine, which can cause a person to sit to urinate because they cannot reliably stand and hit the toilet. Chordee is a separate condition, but where it occurs, the downward curvature of the penis may be enough to make sexual penetration more difficult. For these reasons or others, people with hypospadias may choose to seek urethroplasty, a surgical extension of the urethra using a skin graft. 

Surgery can extend the urinary channel to the end of the penis, straighten bending, and/or change the foreskin (by either circumcision or by altering its appearance to look more typical (&quot;preputioplasty&quot;), depending on the desire of the patient. Urethroplasty failure rates vary enormously, from around 5% for the simplest repairs to damage in a normal urethra by an experienced surgeon, to 15-20% when a buccal graft from the inside of the mouth can be used to extend a urethra, to close to 50% when graft urethral tubes are constructed from other skin.

When the hypospadias is extensive–third degree/penoscrotal–or has associated differences in sex development such as chordee or cryptorchidism, the best management can be a more complicated decision. The world standard (UN and WHO) forbids nonessential surgery to produce a &quot;normal&quot; appearance without the informed consent of the patient, and the American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends but does not require the same standard. The AAP &quot;Textbook of Pediatric Care&quot; states &quot;Gender assignment in patients with genital ambiguity should be made only after careful investigation by a multidisciplinary team; increasingly, surgical decisions are delayed until the child is able to participate in the decision-making process.&quot; A karyotype and endocrine evaluation should be performed to detect intersex conditions or hormone deficiencies that have major health risks (i.e. salt-wasting). If the penis is small, testosterone or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injections may be given with consent to enlarge it before surgery if this will increase the chance of a successful urethral repair.

Surgical repair of severe hypospadias may require multiple procedures and mucosal grafting. Preputial skin is often used for grafting and circumcision should be avoided before repair. In patients with severe hypospadias, surgery often produces unsatisfactory results, such as scarring, curvature, or formation of urethral fistulas, diverticula, or strictures. A fistula is an unwanted opening through the skin along the course of the urethra, and can result in urinary leakage or an abnormal stream. A diverticulum is an &quot;outpocketing&quot; of the lining of the urethra which interferes with urinary flow and may result in posturination leakage. A stricture is a narrowing of the urethra severe enough to obstruct flow. Reduced complication rates even for third-degree repair (e.g., fistula rates below 5%) have been reported in recent years from centers with the most experience. However, typical complications in urethroplasty for severe hypospadias can lead to long surgical cycles of failure and repair, and side effects may include loss of sexual or urinary function. Research suggests failure rates are higher when urethroplasty corrects a born condition rather than disease or injury so patients and families considering surgery for hypospadias should have realistic expectations about the risks and benefits.

===Age at surgery===
The results of surgery are probably not influenced by the age at which repair is done. Teens and adults typically spend one night in the hospital after surgery.

===Preoperative hormones===
Hormones potentially increase the size of the penis, and have been used in children with proximal hypospadias who have a smaller penis. Numerous articles report testosterone injections or topical creams increase the length and circumference of the penis. However, few studies discuss the impact of this treatment on the success of corrective surgery, with conflicting results.

Surgery is not always required for minor hypospadias like glanular hypospadias and coronal hypospadias if the meatus is of good caliber, urine flow is in good stream &amp; forwardly directed.

Hypospadias repair is done under general anesthesia, most often supplemented by a nerve block to the penis or a caudal block to reduce the general anesthesia needed, and to minimize discomfort after surgery.

Many techniques have been used during the past 100 years to extend the urinary channel to the desired location. Today, the most common operation, known as the tubularized incised plate or &quot;TIP&quot; repair, rolls the urethral plate from the low meatus to the end of the glans. TIP repair, also called the Snodgrass Repair (after the creator of the method, Warren Snodgrass), is the most widely used procedure and surgical method for hypospadias repair worldwide. This procedure can be used for all distal hypospadias repairs, with complications afterwards expected in less than 10% of cases.

Less consensus exists regarding proximal hypospadias repair. TIP repair can be used when the penis is straight or has mild downward curvature, with success in 85%. Alternatively, the urinary channel can be reconstructed using the foreskin, with reported success in from 55% to 75%.

Most distal and many proximal hypospadias are corrected in a single operation. However, those with the most severe condition having a urinary opening in the scrotum and downward bending of the penis are often corrected in a two-stage operation. During the first operation the curvature is straightened. At the second, the urinary channel is completed. Any complications may require additional interventions for repair.

==Outcomes==
Problems that can arise include a small hole in the urinary channel below the meatus, called a fistula. The head of the penis, which is open at birth in children with hypospadias and is closed around the urinary channel at surgery, sometimes reopens, known as glans dehiscence. The new urinary opening can scar, resulting in meatal stenosis, or internal scarring can create a stricture, either of which cause partial blockage to urinating. If the new urinary channel balloons when urinating a child is diagnosed with a diverticulum.

Most complications are discovered within six months after surgery, although they occasionally are not found for many years. In general, when no problems are apparent after repair in childhood, new complications arising after puberty are uncommon. However, some problems that were not adequately repaired in childhood may become more pronounced when the penis grows at puberty, such as residual penile curvature or urine spraying due to rupture of the repair at the head of the penis.

Complications are usually corrected with another operation, most often delayed for at least six months after the last surgery to allow the tissues to heal sufficiently before attempting another repair. Results when circumcision or foreskin reconstruction are done are the same. (Figure 4a, 4b)

Patients and surgeons had differing opinions as to outcomes of hypospadias repair, that is, patients might not be satisfied with a cosmetic result considered satisfactory by the surgeon, but patients with a cosmetic result considered not very satisfactory by the surgeon may themselves be satisfied. Overall, patients were less satisfied than surgeons.

Living with hypospadias can present challenging emotional obstacles. Many men, whether they have had surgical repair of their hypospadias as a child or not often are very guarded in school bathrooms or locker rooms. Secrecy about the condition can complicate emotional pain, because talking about the penis is often a taboo subject. Worry, anxiety and feelings of shame are common among adult men born with hypospadias.

==Epidemiology==
Hypospadias is among the most common birth defects in the world and is said to be the second-most common birth defect in the male reproductive system, occurring once in every 250 males. At birth, it may affect as many as 1% of males, although prevalence may vary by country. When including milder cases, as many as 4% of males are affected.

Due to variations in the reporting requirements of different national databases, data from such registries cannot be used to accurately determine either incidence of hypospadias or geographical variations in its occurrences.

==Adults==
While most hypospadias repairs are done in childhood, occasionally, an adult desires surgery because of urinary spraying or unhappiness with the appearance.

A direct comparison of surgical results in children versus adults found they had the same outcomes, and adults can undergo hypospadias repair or reoperations with good expectations for success.

<doc id="383500" wikidata="Q3776837" url="?curid=383500" title="Chordee">
<text>Chordee is a condition in which the head of the penis curves downward or upward, at the junction of the head and shaft of the penis. The curvature is usually most obvious during erection, but resistance to straightening is often apparent in the flaccid state as well. In many cases but not all, chordee is associated with hypospadias. This is not the same condition as Peyronie&#x27;s disease, which involves curvature of the shaft of the penis most commonly due to injury during adult life.

==Signs and symptoms==
It is usually considered a congenital malformation of unknown cause. Since at an early stage of fetal development the penis is curved downward, it has been proposed that chordee results from an arrest of penile development at that stage.

The curvature of a chordee can involve
# tethering of the skin with urethra and corpora of normal size;
# curvature induced by fibrosis and contracture of the fascial tissue (Buck&#x27;s fascia or dartos) surrounding the urethra;
# disproportionately large corpora in relation to the urethral length without other demonstrable abnormality of either; or
# a short, fibrotic urethra that tethers the penis downward (the least common type).

Severe degrees of chordee are usually associated with hypospadias, but mild degrees of curvature may occur in many otherwise normal males. When the curved penis is small and accompanied by hypospadias, deficiency of prenatal androgen effect can be inferred. 

==Cause==
A chordee may be caused by an underlying condition, such as a disorder of sex development or an intersex condition, or from a complication of circumcision, though some medical professionals do not consider it to be true chordee because the corporal bodies are normally formed. However, not all congenital chordee includes abnormal corpora, and case reports of damage to the corpus cavernosum from circumcision are noted in the literature; particularly as a complication of local anesthetic.

==Treatment==
The principal treatment of chordee is surgery in infancy, usually by a pediatric urologist. With chordees caused by circumcision, the preferred method of surgical treatment is a z-plasty. The preferred time for surgery is between the ages of 6 and 18 months and correction is usually successful.

<doc id="383501" wikidata="Q65199" url="?curid=383501" title="Erich Kähler">
<text>Erich Kähler (; 16 January 1906 – 31 May 2000) was a German mathematician with wide-ranging interests in geometry and mathematical physics, who laid important mathematical groundwork for algebraic geometry and for string theory.

==Education and life==
Erich Kähler was born in Leipzig, the son of a telegraph inspector Ernst Kähler. Inspired as a boy to be an explorer after reading books about Sven Hedin that his mother Elsa Götsch had given to him, the young Kähler soon focused his passion for exploration on astronomy. He is said to have written a 50-page thesis on fractional differentiation while still in high school, hoping that it would earn him a PhD. His teachers replied that he would have to attend university courses first.

Kähler enrolled in the University of Leipzig in 1924. He read Galois theory, met the mathematician Emil Artin, and did research under the supervision of Leon Lichtenstein. Still fascinated by celestial mechanics, Kähler wrote a dissertation entitled &quot;On the existence of equilibrium solutions of rotating liquids, which are derived from certain solutions of the n-body problem&quot;, and received his doctorate in 1928. He continued his studies at Leipzig for the following year, supported by fellowship from the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaften, except for a research assistantship at the University of Königsberg in 1929. In 1930 Kähler joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Hamburg to work under the direction of Wilhelm Blaschke, writing a habilitation thesis entitled, &quot;About the integrals of algebraic equations&quot;. He took a year in Rome to work with Italian geometers including Enriques, Castelnuovo, Levi-Civita, Severi, and Segre in 1931-1932, which led him to publish his acclaimed work on what are now called Kähler metrics in 1932. Kähler returned to Hamburg after his year in Rome, where he continued to work until going to the University of Konigsberg in 1935, and was offered an ordinary professorship a year later. In 1938 he married his first wife Luise Günther.

In the years leading up to World War II Kähler was a supporter of Hitler and of German nationalism, and reported that he volunteered for the German military in 1935, joined the navy in 1937, and the army on 24 August 1939 before the invasion of Poland. After being stationed at the Saint-Nazaire submarine base in German Occupied France towards the end of the war, Kähler was captured by the Allies and taken to the prisoner of war camp at Ile de Ré, and then to another camp in Mulsanne. Thanks to the French physicist Frederic Joliot-Curie and mathematician Élie Cartan, Kähler was able to study mathematics during this time, receiving books and mathematics papers and working during his imprisonment. He was released in 1947. He reported that his oath to Hitler (as a civil servant) was important to him, and remained an apologist for the Third Reich decades later, in a 1988 interview with Sanford Segal. A former student reported in 1988 that he kept a Nazi navy flag in his office.

After his release as a prisoner of war Kähler returned to the University of Hamburg to take up a temporary lectureship. He accepted a professorship in 1948 at his alma mater the University of Leipzig, filling a post that had been left open by the death of Paul Koebe in 1945. But in this same year, Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative in the region to German communist leaders, and from October 1949 the region was a part of newly-formed East Germany. Kähler became increasingly unhappy with life in East Germany over the next decade, finally deciding to leave in 1958 to take up a lectureship at Technische Universität Berlin. There he was heralded as among the greatest living mathematicians, and his lectures overflowed with 600 students from engineering and the sciences. In 1964 he returned to the University of Hamburg to fill the post that opened when Artin died in 1962. His wife Luise became ill and died in 1970, and Kähler married his second wife Charlotte Schulze, who was the widow of his brother who had died in the war. Kähler remained at the University of Hamburg until his retirement in 1974.

After retiring Kähler remained an active researcher, writing a number of important papers on the foundations of physics and the Poincaré group, as well as a number of philosophical papers.

==Contributions==
As a mathematician Kähler is known for a number of contributions: the Cartan–Kähler theorem on solutions of non-linear analytic differential systems; the idea of a Kähler metric on complex manifolds; and the Kähler differentials, which provide a purely algebraic theory and have generally been adopted in algebraic geometry. In all of these the theory of differential forms plays a part, and Kähler counts as a major developer of the theory from its formal genesis with Élie Cartan.

Kähler manifolds — complex manifolds endowed with a Riemannian metric and a symplectic form so that the three structures are mutually compatible — are named after him.

The K3 surface is named after Kummer, Kähler, and Kodaira.

His earlier work was on celestial mechanics; and he was one of the forerunners of scheme theory, though his ideas on that were never widely adopted.

<text>Weizhou Island () is a Chinese island in Beibu Gulf in the Gulf of Tonkin. The largest island of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Weizhou is west of Leizhou Peninsula, south of Beihai, and east of Vietnam. Administratively, it is part of Weizhou Town, Haicheng District of Beihai City. The name derives from Chinese 潿 &quot;wéi&quot; (&quot;still water&quot;) and 洲 &quot;zhōu&quot; (&quot;river islet&quot;).

==Geography==
Its north–south length is , east–west . The coast is , with of sandy beach. Weizhou rises in the south, where Nanwan Port (南灣港; pinyin: nánwān gǎng) is located. Coral reefs have been established around the island.

==Climate==
==Geology==
Weizhou Island is China&#x27;s youngest volcanic island. Its origin is probably from a mantle plume that rose 50–32 million years ago, as a result from the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. When the plume reached the asthenosphere, it helped to create the South China Sea by the plume&#x27;s lateral flow. An evidence that the plume still exists is that a lot of basalt has since the Pliocene erupted in the South China Sea and its adjacent areas, for example the Yandunling (烟墩岭) and Yantouling (烟头岭) volcanoes, Leiqiong (雷琼) volcano group, Weizhou Island and Xieyang Island.

The mantle below the Weizhou island has an average temperature of 1,661 °C, which is between the corresponding values of the Hawaii hotspot and the Iceland hotspot.
There have been four periods of volcanic activity on the site, the first one occurred in the early Pleistocene, when mainly ash began to erupt from the bottom of the sea. The second time, between 9–225 million years ago, started with basaltic magma eruptions, and ended with pyroclastic eruptions. This was the time with the heaviest eruptions on Weizhou and Xieyang. The third time began with large amounts of volcanic bombs and ended with basaltic magma, this was from 200,000 to 15,000 years ago. The fourth time, from 10,000 to 7,100 years ago, a few intermittent eruptions happened, first mainly with volcanic bombs, and in the end volcanic ash.

==History==
From 1869 to 1879, the French built a Gothic-style 15 metre Catholic church (涠洲天主教堂) in Shengtang Village (盛塘村; pinyin: shèngtáng cūn), Weizhou. Weizhou Chengzai Church (城仔教堂) was built in 1880, also by French Catholics.

==Wildlife==
Along with smaller Xieyang Island, Weizhou island is a nature reserve named Beihai Weizhoudao Volcano National Geopark to preserve its volcanic features, and protect rich local ecosystem engulfing 147 species of migratory and non-migratory birds, including threatened species such as black-faced spoonbills. An autonomous region-level bird nature reserve was established in 1982, and a bird ringing station for migratory birds was established in 1985. The protected area is located between 20°54′-21°05′N and 109°05′-109°13′E, including Weizhou Island and Xieyang Island, with a total area of . Weizhou, along with nearby Xieyang, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of Chinese egrets and fairy pittas.

Calm and shallow waters around the two islands have shown recoveries in recent years, resulting in sustaining varieties of marine life from coral reefs to megafaunas that are becoming increasingly common in the area. These include such as sea turtles, whale sharks, and several species of cetaceans including endangered Indo-Pacific finless porpoises, nationally protected Chinese white dolphins, and even a blue whale appeared in the waters in 2017. Hepu Dugong National Nature Reserve established in 1992 covers nearby areas and which is the only sanctuary for dugongs in China.

Since 2015, seasonal presences of Bryde&#x27;s whales around Weizhou and Xieyang Islands have been recognized, making the discovery the first confirmed case of large cetaceans regularly inhabiting mainland coasts of China. To protect whales, the local government set a new regulation to prohibit fishery within 6 km of the island. Additionally, the fishery administration has begun patrolling to monitor the public not to engage in whale watching activities until the condition of whales have been thoroughly and scientifically assessed.

<doc id="383510" wikidata="Q685005" url="?curid=383510" title="Ovaltine">
<text>Ovaltine (also known by its original name Ovomaltine) is a brand of milk flavouring product made with malt extract, sugar (except in Switzerland), and whey. Some flavours also have cocoa. Ovaltine, a registered trademark of Associated British Foods, is made by Wander AG, a subsidiary of Twinings, which acquired the brand from Novartis in 2002, except in the United States, where Nestlé acquired the rights separately from Novartis in the late 2000s.

==History==
Ovaltine was developed in 1904 by chemist (1867–1950), in Bern, Switzerland, where it is also known by its original name, Ovomaltine (from &quot;ovum&quot;, Latin for &quot;egg&quot;, and &quot;malt,&quot; which were originally its key ingredients). In 1927, the factory moved out to the village of Neuenegg, a short distance west of Bern, where it is still produced.

Ovomaltine was exported to Britain as &quot;Ovaltine&quot; in 1909. A factory was built in Kings Langley, which took it to the United States as well. By 1915, Ovaltine was being manufactured in Villa Park, Illinois, for the US market. Ovaltine was later manufactured in Peterborough, Ontario, for distribution in Canada. Gerald Ethelbert Goldsmith was the president of the Ovaltine Foods at this time. In 1943, Ovaltine opened its second-largest factory in Devonport, Tasmania, to facilitate the demands of the Australasian and Southeast Asian markets.

Originally advertised as consisting solely of &quot;malt, milk, eggs, flavoured with cocoa&quot;, the formulation has changed over the decades and changed for different parts of the world. In the UK, it no longer contains eggs.

A chocolate malt version is sold as a powder which is mixed with hot or cold milk as a beverage. &quot;Malt&quot; Ovaltine (a version without cocoa) and &quot;Rich Chocolate&quot; Ovaltine (a version without malt) are also available in some markets. Ovaltine also expanded by offering chocolate bars, chocolate Easter eggs, parfait, cookies, and breakfast cereals flavored with the original powder.

Ovaltine also manufactured PDQ Chocolate Flavour Beads, PDQ Choco Chips, Eggnog Flavoured PDQ, and Strawberry PDQ which are no longer available. These drink mixes enjoyed their greatest popularity from the 1960s to the 1980s.

Villa Park, Illinois, was home to the Ovaltine factory in the United States from 1917 until the company&#x27;s purchase and withdrawal in 1988. The Villa Park Historical Society maintains a permanent exhibit of Ovaltine advertising and memorabilia. The old factory was converted to loft apartments keeping the original floors and wall exposed, and is known today as Ovaltine Court.

==Acquisitions==
In 1992, Himmel Group obtained the right to make and sell Ovaltine in the US from Sandoz Nutrition Corporation. In 2002, Himmel sold their rights to Novartis. As of 2007, Nestlé had acquired Novartis&#x27; medical nutrition division and has the rights to Ovaltine.

==International appeal==
Ovaltine was very popular in Britain, and was manufactured at Kings Langley in Hertfordshire using a process that included GEA Wiegand falling film evaporators to concentrate liquid malt extract, which was then dried under vacuum in steam heated band dryers. The art deco style Ovaltine factory in Kings Langley is a well-known local landmark. Production ceased in 2002 and the factory has now been redeveloped as luxury flats. Near the factory was a health farm run by the Ovaltine works, which was set up as a model farm and a health resort for disadvantaged children, which operated until the 1960s. Later, the farm land was sold and is now largely occupied by the M25 motorway. The Ovaltine Egg Farm is now the site of Renewable Energy Systems Ltd.

Due to its high-caloric and sugar content, Ovaltine has been a popular drink for climbers since the early days of mountaineering, including being carried in large quantities in 1902 during the unsuccessful first attempt to summit K2, the world&#x27;s second-tallest mountain, and the first successful summitting of Mount Everest in 1953.
In October 2002, the food and drinks division of Novartis, the maker of Ovaltine, was bought by Associated British Foods. ABF currently produces Ovaltine in Switzerland, China, Thailand and Australia. In Canada, Ovaltine is produced by Grace Foods in biscuit and powdered drink forms. In the United States Nestlé manufactures Ovaltine.

In Hong Kong, Ovaltine, like Horlicks, is known as a café drink. It is served at &quot;cha chaan tengs&quot; as well as fast-food shops such as Café de Coral and Maxim&#x27;s Express. It is served hot, or on ice as a cold drink. In Brazil, it is commonly mixed with vanilla ice cream. In the Asian market, it is a chocolate ice cream flavoured with Ovaltine powder. The McCafé in Hong Kong provides &quot;Ovaltine Crunchy Latte&quot; and other drinks and desserts.

In Malaysia, Ovaltine has lost its popularity to Milo. Ovaltine is sold in Tetra Pak cartons for cold serving and is widely available in shops and supermarkets, yet it has a low profile compared to similar beverages in the market. In Japan, Ovaltine was sold for a short period in the late 1970s by Calpis Industries (presently Calpis Co., Ltd.), but it was not a commercial success. In Australia, Ovalteenies are sold as round tablets of compressed Ovaltine, eaten as candy.

Brazilian fast-food chain Bob&#x27;s, the largest competitor to McDonald&#x27;s in that country, offered, since 1959, milkshakes and sundaes made with Ovaltine, where it goes by the name of &quot;Ovomaltine&quot;, which became a flagship product of the fast-food chain in Brazil. In 2016, McDonald&#x27;s acquired exclusive rights to sell &quot;Ovomaltine&quot;-branded milkshakes. Brazil has the second largest Ovaltine factory, in São Paulo, and is the second largest consumer market for the product, after Thailand. The Brazilian Ovaltine differs from other varieties, originating from an assembly line malfunction that made the powder crispier that is still maintained today.

In 2011, Ovaltine was banned in Denmark under legislation forbidding the sale of food products with added vitamins unless claims about their effectiveness are proven.

==In popular culture==
The US children&#x27;s radio series &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; (1931–1940) and &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; (1938–1949), and the subsequent &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; TV series (1954–1956) were sponsored by Ovaltine. They had promotions in which listeners could save proofs-of-purchase from Ovaltine jars to obtain radio premiums, such as &quot;secret decoder ring&quot; badges, or pins that could be used to decode messages in the program.

Another radio program aimed at five- to fourteen-year-olds, &quot;The League of Ovaltineys&quot;, was broadcast to Great Britain by Radio Luxembourg on Sunday evenings at 5:30 PM. Beginning in February 1935, it was broadcast until September 1939, when the outbreak of World War II forced closure of the station, and again after the war from 1952. As with the US program, listeners could obtain badges, pins, and secret codes. The Ovaltineys&#x27; advertising jingle, which featured the popular English singing trio The Beverley Sisters, was regarded as one of the most successful jingles of the era.

<text>Tabaco, officially the City of Tabaco (; ), is a component city in the province of Albay, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 140,961 people.

==Etymology==
According to native stories, the &quot;Legend of Tabaco&quot; was about a lost foreigner who asked the locals what the name of the place is. However a confused and frightened native whom the lost foreigner asked didn&#x27;t understand what the lost foreigner was asking. The native screamed &quot;Tabak ko!&quot; meaning &quot;My bolo&quot; insinuating a person to get his tabak (presumably for defense). The lost foreigner assumed that the native understood what he asked, then thought the name of the place is Tabaco.

The Official Seal of the city was still conceived from the &quot;Tabak Ko&quot; legend and was officially adopted through Municipal Council Resolution No. 29 on February 23, 1966.

==History==
===Spanish period===
According to the &quot;Estado Geografico Estadistico Historico&quot; written in 1805 by Father De Huerta, the recorded history of the city began in 1587 through the missionary work of the first Franciscan Fathers. In 1616, Fr. Pedro De Alcareso became the first permanent parish priest and established a church dedicated to St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of the city.

The first inhabitants settled along the seashore and engaged in fishing and crude farming. Due to the continuous attacks by the Moro raiders, the natives migrated to San Vicente and San Carlos, and started the foundation of the first poblacion in 1703, while the fishermen of the town transferred to the shores of the bay of what is now known as Barangay Cormidal. Under the administration of the first town executive, a church was built in Cormidal in 1731. Records on the elected &quot;Capitan municipal&quot; (town mayor) started only in 1731 with Martin Aguirre listed as the first mayor of Tabaco.

In 1811, a terrible typhoon called Baguiong Oguis or White Typhoon brought havoc to the town. This was followed in 1814 by the most destructive eruption of the Mayon Volcano, which showered the areas with ashes and stone. These two events rendered many residents homeless and left the fields unproductive for many years after. It took a full decade for the people to recover, at which time they built a cemetery and laid the foundation of the present church which was completed in 17 years.

===American period and independence===
The Americans landed at Tabaco on February 9, 1900, under the command of Col. Walter Howe. Despite the well-documented courage and patriotism of the Tabaqueños, the residents of Tabaco, the superior armaments and well-trained soldiers of the American army hastened its conquest of Tabaco and adjoining towns, starting the American rule in the area.

With the restoration of peace after World War II, the Tabaqueños started rebuilding their lives and their land. By the time the Philippines gained independence in 1946, Tabaco was once again a thriving town.

===Other catastrophic events===
Another catastrophe to hit the town was Typhoon Trix in 1952, which completely submerged Natunawan Island. A 1964 fire razed the commercial center, and in 1970, another destructive storm, Typhoon Sening, slashed through the town.

===Cityhood===

Then Representative Krisel Lagman-Luistro introduced House Bill No. 7851, upgrading the municipality of Tabaco into a component city of the province of Albay. Senate Bill No. 2244 was sponsored by Senators Sergio Osmeña III and Franklin Drilon as its counterpart in the Senate. The Republic Act No. 9020 converted the Municipality of Tabaco into a component city of the province of Albay. It was signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on February 5, 2001. The municipality was finally converted into a city after the plebiscite conducted on March 4, 2001.

<text>Asta Sofie Amalie Nielsen (11 September 1881 – 24 May 1972) was a Danish silent film actress who was one of the most popular leading ladies of the 1910s and one of the first international movie stars. Seventy of Nielsen&#x27;s 74 films were made in Germany where she was known simply as &quot;Die Asta&quot; (The Asta).

Known for her large dark eyes, mask-like face and boyish figure, Nielsen most often portrayed strong-willed passionate women trapped by tragic circumstances. Due to the erotic nature of her performances, Nielsen&#x27;s films were censored in the United States, and her work remained relatively obscure to American audiences. She is credited with transforming movie acting from overt theatricality to a more subtle naturalistic style.

Nielsen founded her own film studio in Berlin during the 1920s, but returned to Denmark in 1937 after the rise of Nazism in Germany. A private figure in her later years, Nielsen became a collage artist and an author.

== Early life ==
Asta Sofie Amalie Nielsen was born in the Vesterbro district of Copenhagen, Denmark, the daughter of Jens Christian Nielsen (1847–1895), an often unemployed blacksmith, and Ida Frederikke Petersen (1843–1912), a washerwoman. She had an older sister, Johanne, who suffered from rheumatic fever throughout her life. Nielsen&#x27;s family moved several times during her childhood while her father sought employment. They lived for several years in Malmö, Sweden, where her father worked at a corn mill and then a factory. After he lost those jobs, they returned to live in the Copenhagen neighborhood of Nørrebro. Nielsen&#x27;s father died when she was fourteen years old. At the age of 18, Nielsen was accepted into the acting school of the Royal Danish Theatre. During her time there, she studied closely with Royal Danish Actor Peter Jerndorff. In 1901, 21-year-old Nielsen became pregnant and gave birth to a daughter, Jesta. Nielsen never revealed the father&#x27;s identity, but chose to raise her child alone with the help of her mother and older sister. Jesta committed suicide in 1964.

Nielsen graduated from the Theater school in 1902. For the next three years she worked at the Dagmar Theatre, then toured in Norway and Sweden from 1905 to 1907 with &quot;De Otte&quot; and the Peter Fjelstrup companies. Returning to Denmark, she was employed at Det Ny Theater from 1907 to 1910. Although she worked steadily as a stage actress, her performances remained unremarkable. Danish historian Robert Neiiendam wrote that Nielsen&#x27;s unique physical attraction, which was of great value on the screen, was limited on stage by her deep and uneven speaking voice.

== Film career ==

Nielsen began her film career in 1909, starring in director Urban Gad&#x27;s 1910 tragedy &quot;Afgrunden&quot; (&quot;The Abyss&quot;). Nielsen&#x27;s minimalist acting style was evidenced in her successful portrayal of a naive young woman lured into a tragic life. Her overt sexuality in the film&#x27;s &quot;gaucho dance&quot; scene established the erotic quality for which Nielsen became known. Because of the film&#x27;s success, Nielsen continued to act in cinema rather than on stage. Nielsen and Gad married, then made four more films together. The explosion of Nielsen&#x27;s popularity propelled Gad and Nielsen to move from Denmark to Germany where she was provided her own film studio and the opportunity for greater profits.

In Germany, Nielsen formed a contract with German producer Paul Davidson, who founded the Internationale Film-Vertriebs-Gesellschaft in conjunction with Nielsen and Gad. The company held the European rights on all Nielsen films and Nielsen became a &quot;scintillating international film star&quot;, known simply as Die Asta (The Asta), with an annual fee of 85,000 marks in 1914 alone.

Davidson described Nielsen as the decisive factor for his move to film productions:
I had not been thinking about film production. But then I saw the first Asta Nielsen film. I realised that the age of short film was past. And above all I realised that this woman was the first artist in the medium of film. Asta Nielsen, I instantly felt could be a global success. It was international film sales that provided Union with eight Nielsen films per year. I built her a studio in Tempelhof, and set up a big production staff around her. This woman can carry it ... Let the films cost whatever they cost. I used every available means – and devised many new ones – in order to bring the Asta Nielsen films to the world.

Nielsen contracted for $80,000 a year, then the highest salary for a film star. Nielsen is called the first international movie star, challenged only by French comic Max Linder, also famous throughout Europe and in America by that time. In a Russian popularity poll of 1911, Nielsen was voted the world&#x27;s top female movie star, behind Linder and ahead of her Danish compatriot Valdemar Psilander. Her film &quot;&#x27;A Militant Suffragette&quot;&#x27; was disrupted at a showing in the Queen&#x27;s Cinema, Aberdeen, Scotland on 4 February 1914, by local suffragists objecting to the portrayal of force-feeding. However she remained popular on both sides through World War I and in 1915 (before the United States&#x27; entry into it) she visited New York City to study American film techniques. However, she departed Germany after a mob on the Unter den Linden mistook her for a Russian at the beginning of the war.

In 1921, Nielsen, through her own film distribution company of Asta Films, appeared in the Svend Gade and Heinz Schall directed &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The film was a radical interpretation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play, with Nielsen playing the role of Hamlet as a woman who disguises herself as a man.

Several sources, including IMDb, state that Nielsen played Mata Hari in an early-1920s film variously titled &quot;Mata Hari&quot;, &quot;Die Spionin&quot; (&#x27;The Spy&#x27;). However, scholarly works such as the authoritative filmography published by Filmarchiv Austria in 2010 make no mention of such a film. Film scholar Ivo Blom has concluded that the idea of Nielsen playing Mata Hari on film arose from a confusion with her now-lost film &quot;Die Tänzerin Navarro&quot; (1922), which features a plot similar to the story of Mata Hari&#x27;s life.

In 1925, she starred in the German film &quot;Die freudlose Gasse&quot; (&quot;The Joyless Street&quot; or &quot;The Street of Sorrow&quot;), directed by G.W. Pabst and co-starring Greta Garbo, months before Garbo left for Hollywood and MGM.

She worked in German films until the start of sound movies. Nielsen made only one feature movie with sound, &quot;Unmögliche Liebe&quot; (&quot;Crown of Thorns&quot;) in 1932. However, the new technical developments in cinema were not suitable to Nielsen&#x27;s style, nor could her maturity compete with the young American ingenues, so she retired from the screen. Thereafter, Nielsen acted only on stage. After the rise of Nazism she was offered her own studio by propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Nielsen later described being invited to tea with Adolf Hitler, who tried to convince her to return to film and explained the political power of her on-screen presence. Understanding the implications, Nielsen declined and left Germany in 1936. She returned home to Denmark where she wrote articles on art and politics and a two-volume autobiography.
She is considered to be a great movie actress because of her natural performing style, adapting to the demands of the film media and avoiding theatrical dramatization. She was also adept at portraying women from varying social strata as well as of different psychologies.

== Assistance to Jews during World War II ==
During the Second World War, she provided money for Allan O. Hagedorff, a young Dane living in Germany, to assist Jews. Using money provided by Nielsen, Hagedorff sent so many food parcels to the Theresienstadt Ghetto that he was warned by the Gestapo. Among others, Victor Klemperer, the diarist and philologist, was offered money by Hagedorff.

== Relationships and death ==
Nielsen had four extended relationships and was divorced twice. In 1912, she married the Danish film director Urban Gad following their move together to Germany in 1911 to build their own film studio. They were divorced by 1919 when Nielsen married the Swedish shipbuilder Freddy Windgårdh. This marriage was shorter, ending in divorce in 1923. Nielsen fell in love with the Ukrainian actor Gregori Chmara whom she met through their mutual friend Georg Brandes. They began a long-term common-law marriage that lasted from 1923 until 1936. Nielsen began a relationship in the late 1960s with Danish art collector Christian Theede, whom she had met through dealings of her own artwork. In 1970, at the age of 88, Nielsen married the 70-year-old Theede. Nielsen and Theede&#x27;s happiness at marrying at an advanced age was celebrated in the world press. Nielsen died at the age of 90 on 25 May 1972 at Frederiksberg Hospital.

== Quotes about Asta Nielsen ==


== Legacy ==

Belgian Paul van Ostaijen included the expressionistic poem &quot;Asta Nielsen&quot;, a paean to Nielsen&#x27;s sensuousness, in his 1921 collection &quot;Bezette Stad&quot; (Occupied City).

Joachim Ringelnatz, who was a frequent guest at Nielsens&#x27; home, wrote the poems &quot;Über Asta Nielsen&quot; (About Asta Nielsen) - for his 1928 collection &quot;Reisebriefe eines Artisten&quot; (An Artist&#x27;s Travel Letters) - and &quot;Asta Nielsen weiht einen Pokal&quot; (Asta Nielsen Dedicates a Trophy) in 1929.

<text> (; German for &quot;Wanna bet that..?&quot;) is a German-language Saturday entertainment television show. It is the largest and most successful television show in Europe. Its format was the basis for the British show &quot;You Bet!&quot; and the American show &quot;Wanna Bet?&quot;

The shows were broadcast live six to eight times a year from different cities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. There were also seven open-air summer shows, broadcast from Amphitheatre Xanten, Plaça de Toros de Palma de Mallorca, Disneyland Paris, Waldbühne Berlin, and Aspendos Roman Theatre. Each of the shows, which were shown without commercial interruption, was usually scheduled to last for about two to three hours, but it was not uncommon for a show to run as much as 45 minutes longer.

The game show gained great popularity in the German-speaking countries through the presenters Frank Elstner, who was also the creator, and Thomas Gottschalk in the 1980s and 1990s. After that, especially due to the takeover of Markus Lanz, the audience ratings dropped significantly, which caused the discontinuation of the show in 2014. From 2021 to 2023, Thomas Gottschalk returned for one episode each year.

== History ==
On 14 February 1981, the German channel ZDF broadcast the first episode in cooperation with the Austrian broadcaster ORF and the Swiss channel SF DRS as an Eurovision network show. The inventor of the show, Frank Elstner, hosted the show until its 39th episode in 1987. &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; has since been hosted by entertainer Thomas Gottschalk, except during a brief interval from 1992 to 1993, when nine episodes were presented by Wolfgang Lippert. Gottschalk hosted his 100th episode of the show on 27 March 2004.

In summer 2007, &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; had its first show in 16:9 widescreen. Since late 2009, Michelle Hunziker has assisted Gottschalk in hosting the show. The show on 27 February 2010 was the first show broadcast in HD. Thomas Gottschalk left the show on 3 December 2011, the end of the 2011 season, because of an accident involving Samuel Koch, a 23-year-old man who became a quadriplegic due to a stunt which he performed on the show on 4 December 2010.

After long speculations who would take over the show, ZDF announced on 11 March 2012 that Markus Lanz would be the next presenter. His first show was on 6 October 2012 and the last show was on 13 December 2014.

The show got a satirical homage with fake bets in 2016 for two episodes of 45 minutes each. It was hosted by comedian Jan Böhmermann.

On 6 November 2021, Gottschalk moderated a one-off repeat of &quot;Wetten, dass...?&quot;

== List of hosts ==
== Concept ==
The core gimmick of the show was the bets: ordinary people offer to perform some unusual (often bizarre) and difficult tasks. Some examples, all of which were performed successfully, include:
* Lighting a pocket lighter using an excavator&#x27;s shovel (19 February 1983)
* Assembling a V8 engine from parts and making it run within 9 minutes (2 November 1991)
* 13 swimmers towing a 312-tonne ship over a distance of 25 meters (7 October 1995)
* Recognising 5 of 6 (out of a total of 75) species of birds blindfolded by feeling a single feather (9 November 2002)
* A Chinese martial artist pushing a car with a spear, the tip of which was resting on his throat
* A nine-year-old boy from Vienna computing the shortest bus and railcar routes throughout the city from memory
* A blindfolded farmer recognizing his cows by the sound they made while chewing apples
* A blacksmith hammering a piece of metal to light a cigarette by kinetic energy, which became famous by a meme named: &quot;Mikaeli, you successfully hit metal 17 times.&quot;
The other major attraction of the show was the top-ranking celebrity guests, with considerable screen time given to the host greeting and chatting with them. Each of the guests had to bet on the outcome of one of the performances and offer a wager, in recent years usually a humorous or mildly humiliating, originally more charitable, activity to be carried out if they lose. Until 1987, each of the celebrities bet on all the performances and the most accurate one was selected to be that show&#x27;s &quot;Wettkönig&quot; (&quot;bet king&quot;). Ever since, one of the people performing the task is selected by a telephone vote. Celebrities that have appeared on the show included a vast range of personalities, with repeated guests including the likes of Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, Cameron Diaz, Naomi Campbell, Michael Douglas, Michael Jackson, Jennifer Aniston, David Beckham, Hugh Grant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Claudia Schiffer, Heidi Klum, Bill Gates, Karl Lagerfeld, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Gerhard Schröder.

Additionally, until 2001, members of the audience could offer bets against the host to find a certain number of unusual persons (e.g. 10 ladies over the age of 65 driving motorbikes). One of these was selected at the beginning of the show and had to be fulfilled by its end. Since 2001, the host bets against the entire city where the show is held.

Between the bets and the celebrity smalltalk, there were musical performances by top-ranking artists like Shania Twain, Johnny Cash, Phil Collins, Take That, Jennifer Lopez, Coldplay, OneRepublic, Rihanna, Spice Girls, Kiss, t.A.T.u., Whitney Houston, Katy Perry, Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Christina Stürmer, Bryan Adams, Shakira, Britney Spears, Scorpions, Bon Jovi, Meat Loaf, Elton John, Tokio Hotel, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Ashley Tisdale, Joe Cocker, Lady Gaga, Luciano Pavarotti, Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Robert Plant, Status Quo, Leona Lewis, David Bowie, Bruno Mars, Cher, Tina Turner, and Michael Jackson.

== Additional information ==
* There was an instance where Frank Elstner lost a private bet himself; he had bet with his family that his colleague and friend Kurt Felix would never fool him. (Kurt Felix ran a show similar to &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, called &quot;Verstehen Sie Spaß?&quot; (&quot;Can You Take a Joke?&quot;). On the 29th show (21 September 1985), after a successful outdoor challenge which involved uncorking a bottle of wine and filling four glasses with a gripper claw fixed to a helicopter&#x27;s skid within the space of minutes, the pilot was invitedalong with the guestsfor a drink of wine. But the contents of the bottle turned out to be pure vinegar, as Elstner discovered when he was the first to take a sample, and the red-haired and bearded pilot revealed himself to the laughing audience as Kurt Felix in disguise. As Felix would later admit in one of his later &quot;Verstehen Sie Spaß?&quot; broadcastings, it was he and his production team who had sent the bet to the ZDF in the first place.
* In a special on German TV, Elstner said, &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; had the chance to have Pope John Paul II on the show, but only via video link, not direct in person. Elstner refused, because this could be precedent for future celebrities and famous people to come on the show via video link and not appear in person on the set. Elstner regretted the once-in-a-lifetime chance to have the pope on his show and said it was the greatest mistake of his career.
* Actor Karl-Heinz Böhm initiated his long-time charity project &quot;Menschen für Menschen&quot; in the third show: Regarding a famine in the Sahel, he said at the end of the show: &quot;I bet that not even one third of our viewers in Austria, Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany will donate one Deutsche Mark for the starving people in the Sahel. And I want to lose this bet.&quot; If he lost, Böhm added, he would himself travel to Africa to hand over the money. Even though Böhm won the bet, as total donations were only around 1.2 million DM, he traveled to Africa and started his aid project for Ethiopia.
* In the 25th show on 15 December 1984, environmental activists ran in front of the cameras with a banner that read &quot;Nicht wettenDonauauen retten&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t betsave the Danube wetlands&quot;). When they were pulled out of the way by the show&#x27;s security, Frank Elstner commanded that no one was to be thrown out of his show. He let the activists make their request and they left the show peacefully. The banner was for the then Austrian chancellor Fred Sinowatz, who was a guest on that show.
* In the 48th show on 3 September 1988, an editor of the German satirical magazine &quot;Titanic&quot;, Bernd Fritz, sneaked into the show as a contestant under the pseudonym Thomas Rautenberg. The real Thomas Rautenberg, a graphic artist from Munich, offered his bet to &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;, to see how the ZDF would react. He claimed to recognize the colour of pencils by tasting them. Bernd Fritz took the bet to the show and won the bet. However he admitted he was cheating and the solution of how he did it could be read in the next issue of &quot;Titanic&quot;. Gottschalk then told the audience that he would read the magazine, and tell the trick in the next show, so that the magazine wouldn&#x27;t get the publicity from this stunt. It was later explained that the blacked ski goggles that contestants wear if they need their vision removed for the bet, were adjusted by Fritz so he could peek through a gap along his nose to see the colour of the pencil. The host tested the visibility through the goggles by faking punches against Fritz eyes and seeing if he would try to dodge them, but after the test it seemed as if Fritz adjusted the goggles to a more comfortable position before he attempted the bet. Since then, swimming goggles with a rubber sealing that sticks to the skin have been used.
* In a show in 1992, actress Whoopi Goldberg came onto the show for a bet. Goldberg lost and as a result, she had to cast Gottschalk in her next movie. That movie was &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; where Gottschalk played the German cook, Father Wolfgang.
* In the 102nd show on 8 December 1996, a live bet at the Russian space station Mir was planned. The cosmonauts wanted to decorate a Christmas tree in zero gravity in two minutes. Because of technical problems, however, the station couldn&#x27;t be contacted during the show.
* Salma Hayek is credited for restarting the popular trend of wearing Trachten (German for costumes, specifically Lederhosen for men and Dirndl for women). Wearing Trachten to the Oktoberfest wasn&#x27;t fashionable for several decades after the second World War, and most of visitors wore the regular clothes. She appeared on the show on 5 October 2008. Salma would have to dress in a Dirndl if she was wrong. Salma decided that the boy would not be successful in assembling a tower of 20 beer crates placed upon one after one and climbing up. The boy failed his mission so Salma didn&#x27;t have to wear the Dirndl presented to her. In a surprise move, Salma indicated she would like to try on Dirndl and see how it looked on her. The audience erupted in applause as she walked off the stage. When she returned to the stage with her Dirndl, Karl Lagerfeld was applauding so loudly and couldn&#x27;t stop looking at her Dirndl. Salma commented how besotted she was about Dirndl and wanted to keep it.

==Cancellation and revival==
===Samuel Koch incident===

Samuel Koch, a 23-year-old aspiring stuntman-turned-actor, became a quadriplegic during a stunt performed on the show on 4 December 2010. The incident was broadcast live on German television. Koch took on a challenge to jump over five moving cars of gradually increasing size using spring-loaded boots. Koch failed to clear the fourth car, driven by his own father. Koch&#x27;s head hit the windshield and he landed on the studio floor, fracturing two cervical vertebrae and damaging his spinal cord.

Koch survived after emergency surgery, but as of 2011 he is permanently paralyzed from the neck down. The episode was suspended and then taken off air about 20 minutes later, for the first time in the program&#x27;s history. In the following episode host Thomas Gottschalk announced his resignation, leaving after the last installment of the 2011 season.

===Decline===

Following Gottschalk&#x27;s retirement, ZDF TV host Markus Lanz took over the hosting of the show (debuting on 6 October 2012). However, his approach to the show did not meet public or critical approval, causing the show to experience a drastic ratings loss. Eventually, with the conclusion of the 2014 Offenburg show (5 April 2014), it was announced that the show would be cancelled at the close of 2014, official statements claiming &quot;out-moded concepts&quot; as the main reason for this decision. This announcement drew protests from both Frank Elstner and Thomas Gottschalk. However, it was also stated that an eventual revival would be considered.

The 215th and last regular show was broadcast on 13 December 2014 from Nuremberg, with Samuel Koch – who never blamed &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; or Gottschalk for his condition – being one of the prominent guests.

===Revival===
On 28 July 2018, ZDF announced a one-evening revival of &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;, owing to the occasion of Gottschalk&#x27;s upcoming 70th birthday (18 May 2020). It was later announced that the special would not happen in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was instead relegated to air live on 6 November 2021. The special became an instant ratings hit, scoring nearly 14 million views, prompting ZDF to consider a full comeback of the show.

With the success of the 2021 show, another broadcast of &quot;Wetten, dass...?&quot; was scheduled for 15 November 2022 out of Friedrichshafen, hosted once again by Thomas Gottschalk. In August 2023, however, Gottschalk announced his ultimate retirement from hosting the show, with the last one being the broadcast on 25 November the same year. This announcement drew hefty criticism from his fanbase.

== International versions ==
In the Netherlands, a version was broadcast between 1984 and 1999 under the name &quot;Wedden, dat..?&quot; by the AVRO and (from the early nineties) RTL 4. The Dutch shows were hosted by Jos Brink until 1993, after which Rolf Wouters took over. Reinout Oerlemans presented the show for one season in 1999.

&quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; inspired the British series &quot;You Bet!&quot;. It was produced by London Weekend Television and was broadcast on ITV from 1988 to 1997. The hosts were Bruce Forsyth (1988–1990), Matthew Kelly (1991–1995), and Darren Day (1996–1997). In August 2024, ITV announced that the show would be returning for two 75-minute episodes later that year with Stephen Mulhern and Holly Willoughby as hosts.

In October 2004, &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; also started in the Chinese television under the title &quot;Wanna Challenge&quot; (as gambling is illegal in China). It is shown once a week and reaches 60 million viewers each episode.

In 1998, a Slovenian version of &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; started weekly on POP TV under the title &quot;Super Pop&quot; hosted by Stojan Auer. There were initiations of close production connections with the original &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;, but the show was canceled because of high production costs before any further common productions were made.

The show was also broadcast with great success in Italy by Rai 1 from 1991 to 1996 (and then in 1999, 2001, and 2003) with the title &quot;Scommettiamo che...?&quot;. In 2008 it was taken up again by Rai 2. It has had ten seasons.

In 2005 and 2006, a Polish version was broadcast under the name &quot;Załóż się&quot;.

In 2006 and 2007 a Russian version was broadcast on the Channel One under the name &quot;Большой спор&quot; (&quot;Bolshoy Spor&quot;, literally &quot;A Big Betting&quot;). The host was Dmitry Nagiev. The show was closed after the seventh episode due to its low popularity.

&quot;¿Qué apostamos?&quot; is the Spanish version of the show. It originally run on Spain&#x27;s national broadcaster TVE 1 between 4 May 1993 and 30 June 2000. The show was fronted by Ramón García, accompanied by Ana Obregón (1993–1998), Antonia Dell&#x27;Atte (1998–1999), and Raquel Navamuel and Mónica Martínez (2000). If the audience bet was completed, the person that placed the bet had to be drenched in water, and if it was not completed one of the presenters or guests had to take the water shower. In 2008, the Spanish federation of regional TV stations operating under the FORTA umbrella later recovered the format, hosted by Carlos Lozano and Rocío Madrid, but the revival was short lived and was swiftly axed due to low ratings and the high cost of producing the programme.

In 2006, ABC signed with reality producer Phil Gurin of The Gurin Company to develop an American version of the show. Six episodes were broadcast in July–September 2008, hosted by British duo Ant &amp; Dec. This is not the first time the show has been produced for American audiences; in 1993, CBS broadcast a pilot called &quot;Wanna Bet?&quot;, hosted by Mark McEwen, which was not picked up as a full series.

There are also plans to show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot; in India, Northern Africa, and the Middle East.

<text>BCE Inc., an abbreviation of its former name Bell Canada Enterprises Inc., is a publicly traded Canadian holding company for Bell Canada, which includes telecommunications providers and various mass media assets under its subsidiary Bell Media Inc. Founded through a corporate reorganization in 1983, when Bell Canada, Northern Telecom, and other related companies all became subsidiaries of Bell Canada Enterprises Inc., it is one of Canada&#x27;s largest corporations. The company is headquartered at 1 Carrefour Alexander-Graham-Bell in the Verdun borough of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

BCE Inc. is a component of the S&amp;P/TSX 60 and is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the American-based New York Stock Exchange. It was ranked as Canada&#x27;s 17th largest corporation by revenue as of June 2014, and as the ninth-largest by capitalization as of June 2015.

==History==

The Bell Telephone Company of Canada Ltd. was created by an act of Parliament on April 29, 1880. Later known as Bell Canada, its charter granted it the right to construct telephone lines alongside all public rights-of-way in Canada. Under a licensing agreement with the US-based American Bell Telephone Company, Bell also manufactured telephones and telephone equipment, an activity that would be spun off in a separate company that later became Northern Telecom and then Nortel Networks.

In 1983, all of the Bell Canada group of companies (also known as the &quot;Bell Group&quot;) were placed under a new holding company, Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. (BCE). This corporate reorganization resulted in Bell Canada and its subsidiaries, including Northern Telecom (later Nortel Networks) and over 80 others, becoming subsidiaries of the new holding company, BCE. Under the new parent, each company was owned directly by BCE, which had the benefit of freeing the manufacturing company, Nortel, and other holdings from the heavily regulated telephone company, Bell Canada. Under a variety of leaders, BCE has embarked on a series of diversifications, consolidations, and corporate strategies. In 1988, Bell Canada Enterprises was shortened to BCE Inc.

===Diversification and expansion===
In 1983, A. Jean de Grandpré, chairman of Bell Canada, was appointed as the first chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of BCE. The company soon embarked on a major diversification into property development, the energy sector, financial services, and other sectors. Within a few years, it became the first Canadian company to report in profits.

When Jean Monty assumed the job of CEO in 1998, he pursued a convergence strategy, attempting to combine both content creation and distribution within BCE, and to take greater advantage of the emerging Internet market. BCE&#x27;s acquisition in 2000 (and subsequent financing) of overseas carrier Teleglobe cost billions of dollars. BCE sold Teleglobe two years later; Jean Monty resigned and was succeeded by Michael Sabia as CEO.

===Refocus on core business===
Michael Sabia refocused BCE on its core telecommunications business, prompting BCE to buy back the 20% share in Bell Canada that it had sold in 1999 to Ameritech (later acquired by SBC Corporation). BCE also spun off operating units that it did not consider to be core to its business, including Emergis in 2004, and Bell Globemedia and Telesat Canada in 2006.

On February 1, 2006, stating the need to remain competitive, Bell Canada announced job cuts of 3,000 to 4,000 employees by the end of 2006.

On April 28 that year, BCE announced that CEO Michael Sabia was taking a 455% pay increase; his salary being raised from to $6.71 million. The pay included a $1.25 million salary, a $2.2 million bonus that Sabia converted to deferred share units, a long-term incentive payout of $3 million and other compensation, the filing shows. Bell Canada also posted record revenue increases for the previous fiscal year.

Under pressure from investors, on October 11, 2006, BCE announced it would be wound down, with its remaining assets converted to an income trust so its income could be distributed directly to shareholders through dividends, avoiding corporate taxes. The new entity was planned to be named &quot;Bell Canada Income Fund&quot;. As part of this restructuring, Bell Aliant offered to take Bell Nordiq private, while remaining separate from the new Bell trust. Due to announced changes in taxation law by the Canadian federal government, on December 12, 2006, BCE announced it would not proceed with its planned conversion to an income trust. It then started planning a restructuring that would have eliminated the BCE holding company, but this was put on hold when the company began attracting takeover bids.

In February 2021, and in line with the growing importance of 5G wireless networks, BCE announced the launch of the largest investment program in its history to double the proportion of Canadians covered.

===Proposed takeover===
Due to its stagnant share price, starting in April 2007, BCE was courted for acquisition by pension funds and private equity groups, including a consortium led by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts as one of the participants), a consortium led by the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan (OTPP), and a consortium that included Cerberus Capital Management. On June 30, 2007, BCE accepted a bid of $42.75 per share in cash, for a total valuation of $51.7 billion, from the group led by the OTPP, and including Providence Equity Partners, Madison Dearborn Partners, Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity, and Toronto-Dominion Bank. The proposed deal would have been the largest acquisition in Canadian history and the largest leveraged buyout ever.
The deal was approved by BCE shareholders,
Quebec Superior Court
(whose ruling was overturned by the Quebec Court of Appeal, but was later upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada),
and the CRTC, subject to certain conditions for its corporate governance structure to ensure that Bell remained under Canadian control.
(See &quot;BCE Inc v 1976 Debentureholders&quot; for further information).

Due to the tightening of the credit market caused by the subprime mortgage crisis, the investment banks financing the deal – led by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland – started negotiations on May 16, 2008, to revise the terms of their loans with greater interest rates and greater restrictions to protect themselves. On July 4, 2008, BCE announced that a final agreement had been reached on the terms of the purchase, with all financing in place, and Michael Sabia left BCE, with George Cope assuming the position of CEO on July 11.

On November 26, 2008, BCE announced that KPMG had informed BCE that it would not be able to issue a statement on the solvency of the company after its privatization, one of the required conditions of the buyout. As a result, the purchase was cancelled.

===Expanding again into mass media===

With Shaw Communications purchasing the Global Television Network, Vidéotron launching its wireless telephone network with video content as a key selling point, and the enormous popularity of wireless and Internet video and other media streams at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, Bell once again sought to bring a content provider into its portfolio. In September 2010, Bell announced a deal to reacquire full control of the broadcasting properties owned by CTVglobemedia including the CTV Television Network. Bell also obtained a 15% interest in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, CTVglobemedia&#x27;s other major asset, with the remaining 85% owned by the Thomson family.
Through this acquisition, Bell responded to an increasing trend away from traditional cable and satellite delivery channels and towards new distribution methods over the Internet and wireless networks.
The CRTC approved the transaction in March 2011.

In 2016, BCE announced that it had entered an agreement to acquire Manitoba Telecom Services (MTS) in a transaction worth $3.9 billion. The deal was approved by both companies&#x27; shareholders and boards of directors, and closed in March 2017 after the Competition Bureau and other agencies approved of the acquisition.

=== Cuts and changes in business strategies ===
In June 2023, BCE announced that it was cutting 1,300 positions across its telecom and media operations (around three per cent of its workforce, and of which approximately 30% were unfilled vacancies), including six per cent of positions at Bell Media (which had 5,645 employees at the end of 2022). The company also announced it would be closing or selling nine AM radio stations, some of which had changed to automated formats during previous rounds of cuts. Three stations—CKWW, CKOC, and CHAM—were sold to CINA Media Group. BCE blamed a number of industry changes and increasing losses in its news divisions for the cuts, while questioning the regulatory priorities of the federal government and the CRTC; one BCE executive mentioned having waited for reforms on some items for years, while also citing &quot;relentless regulatory intervention&quot; by the CRTC to cut wireless and Internet service pricing. This rationale was questioned by union officials and other experts who felt Bell should have better prepared for industry changes, or could have waited for the full implementation of the &quot;Online Streaming Act&quot; (Bill C-11) and the &quot;Online News Act&quot; (Bill C-18).

On February 8, 2024, BCE announced that it would cut 4,800 positions, citing declining revenues, and new CRTC requirements mandating that the company offer wholesale access to its fibreoptic networks to competitors. The cuts resulted in major cuts at Bell Media, including cutbacks at CTV News and the proposed sale of nearly half of its radio stations. In June 2024, BCE announced that it had agreed to sell Northwestel to a consortium of First Nations groups in Northern Canada for around $1 billion. 

On September 18, 2024, it was announced that BCE&#x27;s 37.5% interest in Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE) would be sold to Rogers Communications for $4.7 billion; BCE stated that the sale would be used to fund foundational changes at the company towards being a &quot;techco&quot; rather than a &quot;telco&quot;. As part of the agreement, Bell Media reached long-term deals to maintain its media rights to MLSE-owned teams for 20 years at fair market value. On November 4, 2024, BCE announced its intent to acquire U.S. telco Ziply Fiber—which operates in the Pacific Northwest—for $5 billion (US$3.6 billion).

== Major subsidiaries ==
As of 2016, BCE Inc. has three primary divisions: Bell Canada, Bell Mobility, and Bell Media, comprising over 80% of BCE&#x27;s revenue. Bell Aliant was a subsidiary company formed in 1999 from the merger of the four BCE-controlled telephone companies serving Canada&#x27;s Atlantic provinces. In 2016, the operations of Bell Aliant were consolidated into those of Bell Canada.

Its Bell MTS Inc. subsidiary, owns 100% of its Bell Canada division which includes Bell Aliant, Bell Mobility, Bell Satellite TV, Bell Media, Bell Fibe TV, Virgin Mobile Canada and Lucky Mobile. Bell&#x27;s flanker wireless brand, Virgin Mobile was officially rebranded to Virgin Plus on July 19, 2021, to reflect the brand&#x27;s evolution beyond just wireless offerings which now includes Virgin Plus Internet as well as Virgin Plus TV. 

The Bell Media assets include three Canadian conventional television networks, CTV, CTV 2 and Noovo along with dozens of specialty television channels including BNN Bloomberg, CTV Comedy Channel, CTV News Channel, CTV Drama Channel, CTV Sci-Fi Channel, Discovery Channel, MTV, Much, E!, TSN, RDS and 109 licensed radio stations in 58 markets across the country. It also operates the premium television service (formerly The Movie Network) and over-the-top streaming service Crave, which most prominently holds rights to HBO, Max, and Starz original series, as well as other feature films and original series. 

BCE also owns 18% of the Montreal Canadiens ice hockey club, and (together with BCE&#x27;s pension plan) a 37.5% interest in Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (owner of several Toronto sports franchises). 

=== Bell Canada ===
Bell Canada formed the primary historic core of the company in central, Atlantic, and northern Canada. 
* Bell Aliant
* Distribution (Ontario, Quebec, Atlantic) – Bell Canada, Cablevision du Nord de Quebec Inc. 
* Bell MTS
* Bell Satellite TV – Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership

=== Bell Media ===
Bell Media is the BCE broadcast and media subsidiary. In 2000, BCE bought the CTV Television Network for $2.3 billion. The company combined CTV with its holdings in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper to form Bell Globemedia, with BCE owning 70% and Thomson Newspapers and Woodbridge Co. Ltd. the remainder. In 2005, BCE sold its controlling interest in Bell Globemedia for $183 million to Woodbridge, Torstar, and the Ontario Teachers&#x27; Pension Plan, with BCE retaining a 20% stake. The company was subsequently renamed CTVglobemedia. In 2007, it acquired most assets of CHUM Limited. In 2010, BCE bought out the other owners, acquiring CTV&#x27;s specialty television, digital media, conventional TV and radio broadcasting platforms. In August 2015, BCE sold its remaining 15% stake in the Globe and Mail to Woodbridge. Bell Media&#x27;s subsidiaries:

* Bell Media TV
* Bell Media TV – Sports Specialty Services
* Bell Media TV – Specialty Services (other than Sports)
* Bell Media Radio
* Bell Media Astral – Radio, TV, &amp; Specialty Services
== Other holdings ==
Below is partial list of the holdings of the BCE conglomerate.

=== Montreal Canadiens ===
In 2009, BCE partnered with the Molson family in acquiring the Montreal Canadiens Hockey Club and the Bell Centre. The $575 million purchase was termed &quot;the richest deal in NHL history&quot;; BCE&#x27;s share was reported to be $40 million.

=== Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment ===
In 2011, together with Rogers Communications and Kilmer Sports (holding company of Larry Tanenbaum), BCE acquired Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors professional sports teams. BCE&#x27;s interest is held in partnership with Rogers Communications through the holding company 8047286 Canada Inc., 50% owned by Rogers and 50% by BCE holding company 7680147 Canada Inc., which is in turn 74.67% owned by BCE and 25.33% by BCE Master Trust Fund (investment fund of Bell&#x27;s pension plan).

Kilmer Sports and BCE also co-own the Toronto Argonauts, a team the companies purchased in 2015; BCE and Kilmer each own 50% of the team.

== Past holdings ==
=== BCE Development ===
BCE Development was founded as Daon Development by Vancouver-based developer Jack Poole in 1964. In the mid-1970s, Daon became known for expanding aggressively in the United States. The company first entered the American market in 1976 and nearly quadrupled its total assets to $1.67 billion in four years. It borrowed heavily to finance deals for premium office space and condominium conversions. By 1981, the company had assets worth more than $2 billion. When interest rates soared, however, Daon was caught overextended, could not meet its debt payments, and was forced into a major restructuring with its bankers. In 1985, BCE acquired 68% of Daon from its creditors and changed its name to BCE Development Corporation in February 1986. In March 1986, it agreed to acquire US$1 billion of commercial real estate from the American subsidiary of the Oxford Development Group Ltd., more than doubling BCED&#x27;s portfolio. BCE stated its goal was to convert from a land developer to a developer of prime commercial properties.

In July 1990, BCE Inc. sold 50% ownership in BCE Development to Carena Developments Ltd. (controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family). BCED was renamed Brookfield Development Inc. (now Brookfield Asset Management) followed in 1994 by the remaining 50%.

=== Montreal Trust ===
In March 1989, BCE bought a 64% stake in Montreal Trust from Power Financial for $547-million. The diversification was considered a &quot;natural evolution&quot; due to BCE&#x27;s long-standing interest in financial services, its familiarity in selling services to the public, and its in-house money management operations. In 1993, BCE sold Montreal Trust to Scotiabank for about $290-million, taking a substantial loss.

=== Nortel Networks ===
When BCE was created in 1983, Northern Telecom was transferred from a subsidiary of CRTC-regulated Bell Canada to a non-regulated subsidiary of BCE. In 1998, with Nortel&#x27;s acquisition of Bay Networks, the company&#x27;s name was changed to Nortel Networks. As a consequence of the stock transaction used to purchase Bay Networks, BCE&#x27;s holding was diluted to a minority stake. In 2000, BCE spun out Nortel, distributing its stock in Nortel to its shareholders. Nortel&#x27;s share price collapsed with the dot-com crash of 2000 and combined with a mishandling of a subsequent accounting investigation, the company never fully recovered. It was liquidated in 2009.

=== Teleglobe Inc. ===
In 1987, BCE purchased a 30% stake in Memotec Data Corporation for $196 million. When Memotec purchased international telecommunications carrier Teleglobe Canada from the Canadian government in 1987, the company was renamed Teleglobe Inc. In March 2000, BCE announced the purchase of the Teleglobe shares it did not own for $9.65 billion. In April 2002, BCE announced it was cutting off long-term funding of Teleglobe, would give up on the company, and take a charge of up to $8.5 billion. In 2005, Teleglobe was sold to the Tata Group and is now known as VSNL International Canada. In September 2002, it sold its voice and data business for $197 million.

=== Telesat Canada ===
In 1970, Bell Canada acquired a minority interest in satellite telecommunications carrier Telesat Canada. In 1998, BCE raised its stake to 100% at a cost of $158 million for the 42% of shares it did not already own. In December 2006, BCE announced the sale of Telesat to Loral Space &amp; Communications and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board for CAD$3.28 billion.

=== TransCanada Pipelines ===
In 1983, BCE acquired a controlling 42% stake in TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL). In 1990, it announced its departure from the energy sector and sold its stake in TCPL for $1.1 billion.

== Corporate governance ==
BCE Inc.&#x27;s ISS Governance QualityScore as of December 3, 2019, is 2. The pillar scores are Audit: 1; Board: 3; Shareholder Rights: 3; Compensation: 3.

Corporate governance scores are provided to Yahoo! Finance by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). Scores denote a decile rank relative to index or region. A decile score of 1 denotes the lowest governance risk, while a score of 10 denotes the highest governance risk.

<text>Hakan Yakin (; born 22 February 1977) is a Swiss professional football manager and former player who last coached İstanbulspor in Turkey. He spent the majority of his playing career as a forward or attacking midfielder in the Swiss top flight with brief forays abroad (in France, Germany, Turkey and Qatar). He represented Switzerland national team for eleven years, garnering 87 caps and scoring 20 goals.

==Early and personal life==
Hakan Yakin was born on 22 February 1977 in Basel, Switzerland, to Turkish parents. He grew up and went to school in suburban Münchenstein, Basel-Landschaft, just outside Basel, and close to the borders of France and Germany. He is the younger brother of international football player Murat Yakin, also a former member of the Switzerland national team, who currently works as a manager. His elder half-brother Ertan Irizik is also a former football professional. Yakin&#x27;s surname is based on the Turkish word &quot;Yakın&quot; (meaning &quot;close&quot;, &quot;adjacent&quot;), however as he is a Swiss resident and citizen, the name which he uses is &quot;Yakin&quot;.

==Club career==
As a child, Yakin played in the youth teams of his local side Concordia Basel. He signed his first professional contract with hometown club Basel in January 1995. He played his League debut for Basel on 12 April 1995 in the 1994–95 season in the match against Lausanne. He was brought on in the 60th minute as replacement for Alexandre Rey and with his first touch of the ball, just 18 seconds later, he scored the goal to make it 3–0, a header (final score 5–0).

After two and a half years in Basel, he transferred to Grasshoppers, with manager Christian Gross, but could not establish himself, making most of his appearances as substitute, and he was loaned to St. Gallen for the second half of the 1997–98 season. He moved immediately into the starting eleven and so the loan was prolonged, before he returned to the Grasshoppers.

During January 2001, he transferred back to Basel. At the end of the 2001–02 season Yakin won the national Double with Basel and a year later won the Swiss Cup again. He recalls the 2002–03 Champions League Group B match on 12 November 2002 against Liverpool in St. Jakob-Park as the &quot;match of his life&quot;. The game was drawn 3–3 and Yakin gave all three assists as Basel cruised to a 3–0 half-time lead as they qualified, one point above Liverpool, for the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League second group stage.

Curiosity during the championship play-off round of their 2002–03 season was, that in the home match in the St. Jakob-Park on 19 April 2003, Yakin had a good game and scored a perfect hat-trick during the first half of the game as Basel won 3–0 against Young Boys.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-fcb-yb-2002/03 championship&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Yakin showed his other side in the return match in the Stadion Neufeld in Bern one week later. As YB went a goal up he lost his temper and kicked the ball away, thus collecting a yellow card. Just ten minutes later he committed a rough foul and collecting a second yellow, thus yellow/red, to be sent-off.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcb-achiv-yb-fcb-2002/03 championship&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
His career was then overshadowed by some trouble regarding his club transfers, as his engagements outside Switzerland (Paris Saint-Germain, VfB Stuttgart, and Galatasaray) were not accompanied by luck. In 2005–06, Yakin returned to Switzerland, joining BSC Young Boys. In July 2008, Yakin signed a contract with Qatar champions Al-Gharafa, for a salary of around €2.5 million per year.

In March 2009, it was reported that Yakin had been training with the Grasshoppers Under-21 side, coached by his brother Murat, in a bid to get fit. Yakin then signed a contract on 25 June 2009 in his homeland Switzerland with FC Luzern, running through to 30 June 2011. In summer 2011 his brother Murat became his manager at FC Luzern.

During the mid-season break in January 2012 Yakin transferred to Bellinzona in the Challenge League, the second tier of Swiss football. He played his team debut on 26 February in the 2–0 home win against Stade Nyonnais. He scored his first two goals for the club in the 3–2 away win against Aarau on 9 April 2012.

==International career==

Yakin was capped 87 times for Switzerland, the first coming in 2000. He was offered Turkish nationality before being called up to the Swiss squad, but turned it down for personal reasons. He has played in UEFA Euro 2004, UEFA Euro 2008 and both the 2006 FIFA World Cup and the 2010 FIFA World Cup with his country.

On 11 June 2008, he scored the opening goal in the 32nd minute of Switzerland&#x27;s second Euro 2008 Group A match against Turkey, giving them a 1–0 lead and he refused to celebrate after the goal, out of respect for his family&#x27;s birth country. However, he missed another chance shortly afterward as Turkey scored two second-half goals, resulting in Switzerland&#x27;s becoming the first team to be mathematically eliminated from their own tournament within five days of its beginning. However, in Switzerland&#x27;s final group match against Portugal on 15 June, Yakin added two second-half goals, the second a penalty kick, to secure their first ever win at the UEFA European Championship, 2–0. Yakin finished the tournament as joint-second highest goalscorer with Lukas Podolski, Roman Pavlyuchenko, and Semih Şentürk with three goals each, behind David Villa&#x27;s four goals.

Under new national team coach, Ottmar Hitzfeld, Yakin participated in seven of Switzerland&#x27;s ten qualifying matches for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, starting twice and making five substitute appearances, scoring one goal in Switzerland&#x27;s opening qualifier against Israel. He announced his retirement from the Switzerland national team on 4 October 2011.

==Coaching career==
He was hired as an assistant coach to his brother Murat at Schaffhausen in 2019. After Murat was hired as the manager of the Switzerland national football team in August 2021, Hakan served as a caretaker manager for Schaffhausen for 3 games. He returned to being assistant coach for the remainder of the season under Martin Andermatt. Together, they coached Schaffhausen to a second place finish in the 2021–22 Swiss Challenge League, but missed out on promotion in the promotion playoff. 

On 4 June 2022, he was confirmed as the new head coach at Schaffhausen, as Andermatt&#x27;s contract was not renewed. This appointment is contingent on Yakin entering the course to receive his UEFA Pro Licence. As a result, he was briefly removed from the sidelines, but was later confirmed as head coach on 5 September 2022. On 20 May 2023, he departed Schaffhausen, following a 2–0 loss to Aarau. Due to middling results in his first season as head coach, the club had decided not to renew his contract for the coming season. For personal reasons, Yakin stepped down from his post for the last two games of the season.

<text>Murat Yakin ( ; born 15 September 1974) is a Swiss football coach and former player. He is the manager of the Switzerland national team.

In 2021, following stints as manager at Swiss clubs including Basel, Grasshoppers and Sion, he was appointed as coach of the Swiss national team, guiding them to qualification for 2022 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2024.

== Playing career ==
Yakin spent the longest spell of his career playing for his hometown club Basel, where he was the defensive linchpin, captain and libero of a team which enjoyed domestic and relative European success. He won the Swiss Super League on five occasions (1995, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2005), and the Swiss Cup three times (1994, 2002, 2003). He recalls the 2002–Champions League second leg qualifying match on 28 August 2002 against Celtic in St. Jakob-Park as the &quot;match of his life&quot;. Basel won the game 2–0, with Yakin scoring the second goal in the 22nd minute as Basel qualified 3–3 on the away goals rule for the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League group stage.

In 2003, he played in the FIFA &quot;Match against Poverty&quot; in Basel, on Ronaldo&#x27;s team which won 4–3 against Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s.

Yakin was capped 49 times for the Switzerland national team, representing his country at UEFA Euro 2004.

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
Yakin was appointed coach of Thun in 2009, after a time as a youth coach at Grasshoppers and head coach of Frauenfeld. Yakin led Thun to promotion in his first year as manager there, winning the Swiss Challenge League in 2010. In his second season with the club, Thun managed to finish fifth in the Swiss Super League and earned a spot in the second qualifying round of the following season&#x27;s UEFA Europa League.

In May 2011, he joined Luzern for a reported 200,000 Swiss francs. He took over from Christian Brand, who was made caretaker after the sacking of Rolf Fringer.

===Basel===
On 15 October 2012, Yakin was appointed as the new manager of Basel. Under his management, Basel won twice, home and away, against Chelsea in the 2013–14 Champions League group stage. He praised the supporters in the stadium, saying that they pushed the team to win through the 90 minutes. He was also delighted to have received praise from then Chelsea manager José Mourinho. On 17 May 2014, Basel announced Yakin was no longer with the club after he guided them to two domestic titles in as many years.

=== Spartak Moscow ===
On 16 June 2014, Yakin was appointed as manager of Russian Premier League side Spartak Moscow. According to Russian media, the deal was a long-term contract with Yakin earning an annual salary of 1.6 million euros ($2.18 million).

On 30 May 2015, after only one season with the club, his contract with the club was terminated after a mutual agreement.

=== Return to Schaffhausen ===
On 17 June 2019, it was confirmed, that Yakin had returned to Schaffhausen, as their new manager having left Sion previously that year.

=== Switzerland national team ===
On 9 August 2021, Yakin was appointed as the manager of the Switzerland national team. In the 2022 World Cup qualification, Northern Ireland held reigning European champions Italy to a goalless draw, thereby ensuring that Switzerland qualified for the tournament and Italy had to play in the playoffs. In gratitude, he sent 9.3 kg of Swiss chocolate to the Irish Football Association. In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, he led Switzerland to finish second in their group, to qualify to the round of 16, where they lost 6–1 to Portugal. At the UEFA Euro 2024 tournament, Yakin guided Switzerland through to the Round of 16 knockout stage where they recorded a famous 2-0 victory against defending champions Italy. They were subsequently knocked out of the Quarter Finals in a penalty shootout loss to England, after a 1-1 draw.

== Personal life ==
Yakin is the elder brother of Hakan Yakin, who was also a professional footballer with successful stints at Grasshoppers, Basel, and Young Boys and represented Switzerland at international level also. Yakin is of Turkish descent.

<doc id="383530" wikidata="Q3366143" url="?curid=383530" title="Canadian Action Party">
<text>The Canadian Action Party (CAP) (, PAC) was a Canadian federal political party founded in 1997 and deregistered on 31 March 2017.

The party stood for Canadian nationalism, monetary and electoral reform, and opposed liberal globalization and free trade agreements that had been signed by the Canadian government.

== History ==
The Canadian Action Party (CAP) was founded by Paul Hellyer, a former Liberal minister of national defence in the cabinet of Lester B. Pearson. Hellyer ran unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, and for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1976.

CAP nominated candidates for the first time in the 1997 federal election.

After the 1997 election, it absorbed the Canada Party, another minor party concerned about monetary reform which had been formed by former members of the Social Credit Party of Canada. Former Canada Party leader Claire Foss served as vice president of CAP until November 2003.

Hellyer resigned as CAP leader in 2003 after the New Democratic Party (NDP) never agreed to a merger proposal, under which the NDP would change its name. In 2004, Connie Fogal, an activist lawyer, was acclaimed party leader after David Orchard failed to respond to an invitation to take over the leadership. Fogal stepped down in 2008; he was succeeded by Andrew J. Moulden following the 2008 federal election.

The acting chief electoral officer of Canada advised the party leader that the party would be deregistered effective Friday, March 31, 2017, for not having at least 250 members who are eligible voters.

== Positions ==

A number of CAP members also belonged to the Committee on Monetary and Economic Reform and had been influential in developing CAP&#x27;s monetary policy, particularly its position that the Bank of Canada, rather than chartered banks, should provide loans to the government, if required, to fund public spending.

CAP also argued for the abrogation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and opposed current government trade initiatives and any legislation leading to the Free Trade Area of the Americas, Trans-Pacific Partnership and what it saw as integration with the United States and Mexico into a North American Union.

<doc id="383531" wikidata="Q1347416" url="?curid=383531" title="Epispadias">
<text>Epispadias is a birth defect in which the urethra fails to fully develop, resulting in urine leaving the body from an abnormal site. In males, this may be an opening on the upper aspect of the penis, and in females when the urethra develops too far anteriorly. It occurs in around 1 in 120,000 male and 1 in 500,000 female births.

==Signs and symptoms==
Most cases involve a small and bifid penis, which requires surgical closure soon after birth, often including a reconstruction of the urethra. Where it is part of a larger exstrophy, not only the urethra but also the bladder (bladder exstrophy) or the entire perineum (cloacal exstrophy) are open and exposed on birth, requiring closure.

===Relationship to other conditions===
Despite the similarity of name, an epispadias is not a type of hypospadias, and involves a problem with a different set of embryologic processes.

Women can also have this type of congenital malformation. Epispadias of the female may occur when the urethra develops too far anteriorly, exiting in the clitoris or even more forward. For females, this may not cause difficulty in urination but may cause problems with sexual satisfaction. Frequently, the clitoris is bifurcated at the site of urethral exit, and therefore clitoral sensation is less intense during sexual intercourse due to frequent stimulation during urination. However, with proper stimulation, using either manual or positional techniques, clitoral orgasm is definitely possible.

==Causes==
Epispadias is an uncommon and partial form of a spectrum of failures of abdominal and pelvic fusion in the first months of embryogenesis known as the exstrophy - epispadias complex. While epispadias is inherent in all cases of exstrophy it can also, much less frequently, appear in isolation as the least severe form of the complex spectrum. It occurs as a result of defective migration of the genital tubercle primordii to the cloacal membrane, and so malformation of the genital tubercle, at about the 5th week of gestation.

==Treatment==
The main treatment for isolated epispadias is a comprehensive surgical repair of the genito-urinary area usually during the first 7 years of life, including reconstruction of the urethra, closure of the penile shaft and mobilisation of the corpora. The most popular and successful technique is known as the modified Cantwell-Ransley approach. In recent decades however increasing success has been achieved with the complete penile disassembly technique despite its association with greater and more serious risk of damage.

==Prognosis==
Even with successful surgery, patients may have long-term problems with: 
* incontinence, where serious usually treated with some form of continent urinary diversion such as the Mitrofanoff
* depression and psycho-social complications 
* sexual dysfunction

<text>The Marijuana Party () is a Canadian federal political party, whose agenda focuses on issues related to cannabis in Canada. Apart from this one issue, the party has no other official policies, meaning party candidates are free to express any views on all other political issues. Passage of the &quot;Cannabis Act&quot; in June 2018 legalized cannabis on 17 October 2018. However, the party is critical of some of the laws relating to cannabis since legalization and wants to see them changed or reformed. It also seeks to represent and advocate for the rights of cannabis consumers, growers, and small cannabis based businesses.

Candidates appear on election ballots under the short form &quot;Radical Marijuana&quot; and their status is similar to that of independent candidates. Although governed by the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot;, the Marijuana Party is a &quot;decentralized&quot; party, without by-laws, charter or constitution that govern its operations. Its Electoral District Associations are autonomous units of the party as a whole.

==History==
The party was founded by Marc-Boris St-Maurice in February 2000. In the November 2000 federal election, the party nominated candidates in 73 ridings in seven provinces and won 66,419 votes (0.52% of national popular vote).

In January and May 2004, changes were made to Canada&#x27;s electoral laws which significantly reduced the fundraising abilities of the Marijuana Party; specifically, the elections law was amended so that most of the Marijuana Party&#x27;s political contribution tax credit scheme was criminalized. The result of those changes was a very significant drop in the party&#x27;s funding by 95%. As of 2004, parties with more than two per cent of the national vote were eligible to receive $2 per year per individual vote, as well as have the majority of their election expenses refunded. Small parties unable to secure two per cent of the vote do not qualify for any subsidy from votes or for election expenses. In the June 2004 federal election, the party nominated 71 candidates, but won only 33,590 votes (0.25% of the national popular vote).

On February 28, 2005, founder St-Maurice announced his intention to join the Liberal Party in order to work for liberalized marijuana laws from within the governing party. Many former Marijuana Party members have joined one of the mainstream political parties (NDP, Liberal, Conservative, or Green) in order to push for reform from within. In 2005, Elections Canada recognized Blair T. Longley as the new party leader following St-Maurice&#x27;s resignation.

In the January 2006 federal election, the party ran candidates in 23 ridings and received 9,275 votes (0.06% of the national popular vote). In the Nunavut riding, however, the party&#x27;s candidate won 7.88% of all ballots cast and finished in fourth place, ahead of the Greens.

===Criticisms of Canada&#x27;s legalisation (2018–present)===

In June 2018, the party&#x27;s leader, Blair Longley, addressed concerns about Canada&#x27;s cannabis legalisation plans, referring to it as &#x27;prohibition 2.0’. Referring to Canada&#x27;s legalisation plans he said &quot;There&#x27;s this slight bit of progress, but when you look at the bigger picture, it&#x27;s nothing close to what we would want.&quot; He said that &quot;Legalisation is great if you&#x27;re rich and old and have your own house and can afford to buy expensive marijuana. But if you&#x27;re still young and poor and don&#x27;t own your own house, it&#x27;s worse than it was before.&quot; In relation to this Longley brought up some of the varying restrictions across the country, such as landlords in Alberta and Nova Scotia being granted permission to ban cannabis use and cultivation on their properties and Calgary&#x27;s city council passing a bylaw prohibiting pot consumption in public. Another issue he brought up concerned people&#x27;s limit to only being able to grow up to four marijuana plants per household, while people can brew as much beer and wine as they want and grow up to of tobacco.

Other concerns about Canada&#x27;s marijuana legalisation include, tough penalties for those who break drug laws, such as prison sentences of up to 14 years for providing marijuana to a minor or selling it without a license. There are also concerns about restricting sales to government-run monopolies, which favours large producers and makes it very difficult for small businesses in the market. Critics have concerns about the stake of producers and private companies, such as owning patents to names and genetic strains. Longely has been referred to as &quot;skeptical about the quality of the bud commercial producers are putting to market&quot; and has said that there is an opportunity for the black market to offer better quality marijuana at lower prices.

Since the announcement of Canada&#x27;s legalisation plans, Longley said the party is being run on a &quot;broken shoestring budget&quot; and is getting &quot;more and more broken and shorter and shorter all the time&quot;; he also questioned whether the party would be able to remain registered. The party needs 250 members&#x27; signatures so it can be registered with Elections Canada.

==Election results==
==Leaders==
* Marc-Boris St-Maurice (2000–2004)
* Blair Longley (2004–present)

==Provincial parties==
In addition to the Bloc Pot party in Quebec, the Marijuana Party has several separate provincial counterparts, most notably, the British Columbia Marijuana Party which received over 3% of the vote in the 2001 provincial election, the Alberta Marijuana Party led by Kenneth Kirk, and the Marijuana Party of Nova Scotia. The Bloc Pot and the federal Marijuana Party work together; however, the BC Marijuana Party and the federal Marijuana Party do not work together as the BC Party Marijuana decided to direct their activism into mainstream political parties.

<text>A postdoctoral fellow, postdoctoral researcher, or simply postdoc, is a person professionally conducting research after the completion of their doctoral studies (typically a PhD). Postdocs most commonly, but not always, have a temporary academic appointment, sometimes in preparation for an academic faculty position. According to data from the US National Science Foundation, the number of holders of PhD in biological sciences who end up in tenure track has consistently dropped from over 50% in 1973 to less than 20% in 2006. They continue their studies or carry out research and further increase expertise in a specialist subject, including integrating a team and acquiring novel skills and research methods. Postdoctoral research is often considered essential while advancing the scholarly mission of the host institution; it is expected to produce relevant publications in peer-reviewed academic journals or conferences. In some countries, postdoctoral research may lead to further formal qualifications or certification, while in other countries, it does not.

Postdoctoral research may be funded through an appointment with a salary or an appointment with a stipend or sponsorship award. Appointments for such a research position may be called postdoctoral research fellow, postdoctoral research associate, or postdoctoral research assistant. Postdoctoral researchers typically work under the supervision of a principal investigator. In many English-speaking countries, postdoctoral researchers are colloquially referred to as &quot;postdocs&quot;.

==Job security in academia==
Due to the nature of their work in some fields, and an oversupply of graduating PhD students in many fields, some postdoctoral researchers in certain countries face an uncertain future in academia, and a large proportion will not gain tenure or a coveted faculty position in their chosen field of research. 

A study on the topic was conducted in collaboration between Virginia Tech and MIT in 2018. The authors found that only about 17% of postdocs ultimately land tenure-track positions. In the 1970s the number for PhD holders in biological sciences was 50%, illustrating how that generation had a significantly different job market.

As of 2022, however, and the broad shifts in the labor market in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, postdoc positions in at least some fields are going unfilled due to a lack of applicants.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom in 2003, 25% of PhD graduates in the natural sciences continued to undertake post-doctoral research. Since the landmark ruling in the employment tribunal (Scotland) Ball vs Aberdeen University 2008 case (S/101486/08), researchers who have held successive fixed-term contracts for four years&#x27; service are no longer temporary employees but are entitled to open-ended contracts.

== United States ==
In the US, a postdoctoral scholar is an individual holding a doctoral degree who is engaged in mentored research or scholarly training for the purpose of acquiring the professional skills needed to pursue a career path of his or her choosing. Postdoctoral researchers play an important role in spearheading postgraduate research activity in the US. The median salary of postdoctoral researchers one to five years after receiving their doctoral degrees is $42,000, 44% less than the $75,000 average for tenured positions. The National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) and Boston Postdoctoral Association (BPDA) are nonprofit organizations that advocate for postdoctoral scholars in the United States.

Postdoctoral research may be required for obtaining a tenure-track faculty position, especially at research-oriented institutions. Post-doctoral appointments that were traditionally optional have become mandatory in some fields as the degree of competition for tenure-track positions in academia has significantly increased over previous decades. In fact, the small supply of the professional positions in academia compared to the growing number of postdoctoral researchers makes it difficult to find tenure-track positions. In 2008, the proportion of postdoctoral researchers who got a tenure or tenure-track position within 5 years after they received a doctoral degree was about 39%; nearly 10% of postdoctoral researchers were over 40 years old in 2003.

On the other hand, 85 percent of engineering doctoral degree holders are likely to initially go into business or the industry sector. Under the circumstances, providing doctoral students as well as postdoctoral researchers with necessary skills for nonacademic positions has become one of the important roles for graduate schools and institutions. The America COMPETES Act recognized the importance of graduate student support for obtaining skills needed when they pursue nonacademic careers, and required National Science Foundation (NSF) to increase or decrease funding for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) programs at least at the same rate as it increases or decreases funding for the Graduate Research Fellowship. There are no comprehensive data of international postdoctoral researchers in the US because of the less-organized survey and the difficulty in counting international postdoctoral researchers. The proportion of postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas reached 53.6% in 2010. The life sciences hold the largest percentage of postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas; in 2008, approximately 56% of postdoctoral researchers in the life sciences were temporary residents. Of these postdoctoral researchers on temporary visas, four out of five earned their PhD outside of the United States. There exists fear that foreign PhD&#x27;s are taking postdoctoral research positions from American researchers. The influx of foreign PhD&#x27;s has influenced the supply of ready-researchers, and thereby, the wages. One estimate claims that a 10% increase in the supply of foreign postdoctoral researchers lower the position salary by 3 to 4%.

In the US, life sciences have a greater share than other fields due to higher federal funding of life and medical science areas since the mid 1990s. One survey shows that 54% of postdoctoral researchers major in life sciences, whereas those who majored in physical science, mathematics, and engineering account for 28%.

In 2010, postdoctoral researchers in California formed a union, UAW Local 5810 in order to secure better working conditions such as the right to file a complaint for alleged discrimination or sexual harassment through a formal grievance procedure. In California, new postdoctoral appointments receive at least the NIH postdoctoral minimum salary ($50,004 in 2019) and many receive annual pay raises of 5% to 7% or more in accordance with the NIH&#x27;s Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards (NRSA).

In 2014, postdoctoral researchers in Boston organized the &quot;Future of Research&quot; Symposium to respond to a conversation about the state of biomedical research from the perspective of junior scientists. The meeting included panel discussions with academics concerned about the scientific enterprise, a video message from Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, and workshops discussing training, funding, the structure of the biomedical workforce, and metrics and incentives in science which were used to generate recommendations in a white paper. Meetings organized by postdoctoral researchers in 2015 spread to New York University (NYU), Chicago and San Francisco and a second meeting in Boston discussed data collection, labor economics and evidence-based policy to advocate for changes to science, including the future of the PhD.

== India ==
Most of India&#x27;s premier engineering, science and management institutes (like Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISERs), Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and All India Institutes of Medical Sciences(AIIMS) have postdoctoral positions. The salary typically varies from ₹65,000 to ₹80,000 per month plus HRA. For example, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Guwahati, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, IISER Bhopal, IISER Mohali, IISER Pune, IISER Kolkata, IIM Kolkata offer postdoctoral fellowships. The Indian Council of Social Science Research also offers fellowship(s) for pursuing a post doctoral degree. 

== Australia ==
Salaried appointments at the minimum Level A, Step 6 for academic salaries, for doctoral qualified employees (beginning in 2008) are set at A$75,612 p.a. at the University of Sydney, A$75,404 p.a. at the University of Melbourne, and A$75,612 p.a. at the University of New South Wales.

Alternatively the Australian Research Council (ARC) provides Postdoctoral Fellowships. For example, their Discovery Projects, funds 3 year Fellowships, beginning in 2009, with A$61,399 p.a. Furthermore, a mandatory superannuation payment of 11–17% is paid by Universities.

== China ==
The postdoctoral system in China was founded in 1985 upon suggestion by Chinese American physicist and Nobel laureate Tsung-Dao Lee. The Office of the National Administrative Committee of Postdoctoral Researchers () regulates all postdoctoral mobile stations () at universities and postdoctoral work stations () at institutes and enterprises in mainland China. Applicants to postdoctoral positions have to pass a detailed medical check-up in order to enter the stations (). Postdoctoral researchers are required to undergo regular evaluations, and submit a research report for evaluation at the end of the postdoctoral period to obtain approval to leave the stations (). Those who are approved to leave the stations will receive a postdoctoral certificate from the national administration office. In some universities, postdoctoral researchers who fail to leave their stations normally, either due to failing their evaluations or early withdrawal from the stations (), may be asked to pay back the grants or even the salaries that they have received. Because of the way that the postdoctoral system is managed, postdoctoral research is widely mistaken to be an academic degree in China. The government&#x27;s administration of the postdoctoral system has been criticized for hindering innovative research, as too much effort is spent on evaluations, and overemphasis on performance prevents the creation of a relaxing research environment.

<doc id="383544" wikidata="Q1066657" url="?curid=383544" title="Ice Climber">
<text>is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo. It was released in 1985 for both the arcade VS. System and the Famicom / Nintendo Entertainment System console. The characters Popo and Nana, known as the Ice Climbers, scale 32 vertically scrolling, ice-covered mountains to recover stolen vegetables from a giant condor. In some European countries, &quot;Ice Climber&quot; was bundled with the Nintendo Entertainment System.

The arcade version, has an animated title screen, a stage select menu at the start of the game and between levels, 16 more mountains, occasional blizzard and wind effects, more enemy characters, and bonus multiplier items.

Nana and Popo are playable characters in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, starting with the 2001 game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot; for the GameCube. Nintendo released the NES version for the Game Boy Advance through the Nintendo e-Reader in 2002.

==Gameplay==

The first player controls Popo, a boy wearing a blue parka, while the second player controls Nana, a girl wearing a pink one. The only tool they carry is a wooden mallet to carve openings in the ice above and to club enemies. Each mountain level consists of eight layers of colorful ice and a bonus stage. Standard, dull ice blocks pose no threat other than an easily disposed-of barrier and platform. Square ice blocks with higher detail are indestructible, forcing the player to take another path. Hatched ice acts as a conveyor belt sliding Popo or Nana either left or right. Finally, many mountains include unbreakable moving platforms resembling clouds. The bonus stage takes place at the peak. Within a 40-second time limit and no enemies, the Ice Climbers often face trickier jumps and multiple moving platforms. The peak is also the only place to recover stolen vegetables, most notably eggplants. Collecting just one piece of corn from the fifth bonus stage is the only way to gain an extra life. At the top of the peak, the Condor flies overhead.

Enemies encountered on the way up the mountains include the Topi, Nitpicker, and White Bear. Topis come in two varieties: the blue seal featured in the Japanese Famicom &quot;Ice Climber&quot; release and the short Yeti-like creatures seen in Western versions and &quot;VS. Ice Climber&quot;. Topis have the ability to fill in holes in the floor with ice. To do this, a Topi scouts out an opening in the floor, runs back to its cave, and reemerges pushing an icicle to fill in two blocks. This process repeats until no more openings on their layer of ice exist. The Nitpicker is a small, mountain-dwelling bird that swoops down from icy caves on the levels&#x27; edges. Unlike the Topi, which is confined to one floor of the mountain, Nitpickers can cross over multiple ice layers. Taking them into account along with moving platforms and sliding ice, timing jumps can be more difficult. The final enemy is the White Bear. This enemy, wearing sunglasses and pink speedo, appears on screen only when Popo and Nana take too long to advance. Pounding the ice, the Polar Bear forces the screen to move up. If Nana or Popo are forced off the screen, the player loses a life.

Other obstacles include deadly falling icicles. These can form on the bottom of any type of platform. After a few successful mountains climbed, all enemies&#x27; speeds increase.

The arcade game &quot;VS. Ice Climber&quot; has a few more gameplay differences. The player must pick from an initial set of 24 mountains to conquer. After eight are cleared, a Super Bonus stage occurs in which the player must reach a high platform. Afterwards, the player must choose from the second set of 24 mountains, in which the Condor is replaced by a giant butterfly. After the next eight stages are cleared and the Super Bonus is over, the player resumes the cycle from the original mountain set. The game keeps track of whether the mountain was claimed by an Ice Climber or if it remains Topi territory—once all the stages are completed, the counter resets. Approximately 30 of the 48 level designs are borrowed from the NES game. Stage setups are generally trickier in &quot;VS. Ice Climber&quot;, with some new mechanics such as cloud platforms that move diagonally or strong gusts of wind. A purple bee with a spear flying in a horizontal pattern is included as a somewhat rare fourth enemy.

After the bonus stage, the players&#x27; scores are tallied. Points are rewarded for every brick of ice destroyed, every Topi-pushed icicle smashed, every Nitpicker killed and every vegetable collected. Finally, a bonus score is rewarded if a player manages to climb to the top of the bonus stage and jump up and grab the Condor. The game keeps track of the high score, although there is no way to save it on the NES version.

The game can be played in one- or two-player mode. The latter places Popo and Nana against each other in a race to the summit. Players may prefer to play cooperatively on the way up, but during the bonus round, they must compete for the top.

==Development==

&quot;Ice Climber&quot; and &quot;NES Open Tournament Golf&quot; were directed by longtime Nintendo producer Kenji Miki. &quot;Ice Climber&quot; is the first video game programmed by Kazuaki Morita. He considered this a &quot;warm-up&quot; before becoming a main programmer on &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;. Morita was later credited with central programming roles in numerous games within the &quot;Super Mario&quot; series, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series, and in &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;.

==Releases==
&quot;Ice Climber&quot;, a launch game for the NES in North America, has been re-released for several of Nintendo&#x27;s consoles. The PC-8801 version has a more limited color palette and a reworked HUD. &quot;VS. Ice Climber&quot; has been re-released for the Famicom Disk System, removing the difficulty settings and changing a few graphics to be closer to &quot;Ice Climber&quot; (such as the bee and butterfly replaced by a Nitpicker and blue Condor, respectively). It has also been released in the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series on Nintendo Switch, although the bee enemy has been removed.

Including the releases listed below, the NES game was part of a few versions of &quot;Animal Crossing&quot;. It could be played in the original &quot;Doubutsu no Mori&quot; through its Nintendo Space World 2000 demo and through a Controller Pak from Nintendo Dream. The Pak could be won by anyone who sent a form to Nintendo Dream by June 21, 2001. It is also unlockable in the GameCube releases; it can only be officially unlocked via a North America-exclusive e-Reader card, or as a gift to players requesting their save data be transferred from the Japanese-exclusive Nintendo 64 version to the &quot;Doubutsu no Mori+&quot; edition.

==Reception==

In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;VS. Ice Climbers&quot; in its April 1, 1985, issue as the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the month. Former President of Finland Mauno Koivisto was reportedly keen on Nintendo games and his son-in-law has reported that &quot;Ice Climber&quot; was his favorite game.

Reviewing the American release, &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; magazine called it &quot;addictive&quot; for fans of climbing games. The reviewer awarded 3.5 out of 4 stars, for both categories of graphics and gameplay, adding that it provide &quot;hours of challenging play&quot;.

==Legacy==

Popo and Nana appear in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of fighting game as a two-in-one playable fighter under the name Ice Climbers, voiced by Sanae Kobayashi. Appearing in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Melee&quot;, and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Brawl&quot;, their return was planned for &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot;, but technical issues with the 3DS version required game director Masahiro Sakurai to scrap development on them to maintain parity between the two versions. He said that there was not a high priority to include them because the &quot;Ice Climber&quot; series was &quot;unlikely to have another installment&quot; at the time. The Ice Climbers returned in 2018&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate&quot;.

Themes from &quot;Ice Climber&quot; regularly appear in the &quot;WarioWare&quot; series&#x27; classic Nintendo microgames. In &quot;&quot; and &quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot;, when Kirby gets the Freeze ability, he dons Popo&#x27;s parka in the same manner it is worn in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series. In &quot;Tetris DS&quot;, an &quot;Ice Climber&quot; backdrop appears among other classic Nintendo games. &quot;Daigasso! Band Brothers&quot; includes the bonus stage music theme. The Ice Climbers appear in &quot;Super Mario Maker&quot; as an unlockable Mystery Mushroom costume.

<text>Douglas William Jerrold (3 January 18038 June 1857) was an English dramatist and writer.

==Early life==
Jerrold&#x27;s father, Samuel Jerrold, was an actor and lessee of the little theatre of Wilsby near Cranbrook, Kent. In 1807 the family moved to Sheerness, where Jerrold spent his childhood. He occasionally took a child part on the stage, but his father&#x27;s profession held little attraction for him. In December 1813 he joined the guard ship &quot;Namur&quot;, where he had Jane Austen&#x27;s brother Charles Austen as captain, and served as a midshipman until the Treaty of Paris in 1815. He saw nothing of Napoleonic Wars save a number of wounded soldiers from Waterloo, but he retained an affection for the sea.

The peace of 1815 ruined Jerrold&#x27;s father; on 1 January 1816 he took his family to London, where Douglas began work as a printer&#x27;s apprentice, and in 1819 he became a compositor in the printing office of the &quot;Sunday Monitor&quot;. Several short papers and copies of verses by him had already appeared in the sixpenny magazines, and a criticism of the opera &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; was admired by the editor, who requested further contributions. Thus Jerrold became a professional journalist.

==Theatre==

In 1821, a comedy that Jerrold had written at age 14 was brought out at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre under the title &quot;More Frightened than Hurt&quot;. Other plays followed, and in 1825 he was employed for a few pounds weekly to produce dramas and farces to order for George Bolwell Davidge of the Coburg Theatre. In the autumn of 1824, the &quot;little Shakespeare in a camlet cloak&quot;, as he was nicknamed, married Mary Swan and continued to work as both dramatist and journalist. For a short while he was part proprietor of a small Sunday newspaper. In 1829, through a quarrel with the exacting Davidge, Jerrold left for Coburg.

In 1829, a three-act melodrama about corrupt personnel and press gangs of the Navy launched his fame. &quot;Black-Eyed Susan&quot;; or, &quot;All in the Downs&quot;, was brought out by manager Robert William Elliston at the Surrey Theatre. Britain at the time was recovering from the fallout of the Napoleonic Wars and was in the midst of a class war involving the Corn Laws and a reform movement which resulted in the Reform Act 1832 aimed at reducing corruption. &quot;Black-Eyed Susan&quot; consisted of various extreme stereotypes representing the forces of good, evil, the innocent and the corrupt, the poor and the rich, woven into a serious plot with comic sub-plots to keep the audience entertained. Its subject was very topical, and its success was enormous. The play was a success, and Elliston made a fortune from it; T. P. Cooke, who played William, made his reputation; Jerrold received about £60 and was engaged as dramatic author at five pounds per week, but his reputation as a dramatist was established.

In 1830, &quot;Mutiny on the Nore&quot; or &quot;British Sailors in 1897&quot;, a play (&quot;nautical drama&quot;) in three acts about the 1797 Navy mutinies was first performed at the Pavilion Theatre 7th June 1830 with Thomas Cobham (actor) as Parker, and Royal Coburg Theatre 23rd August 1830, and Tottenham Street Theatre 1830.

It was proposed in 1830 that he should adapt something from the French language for Drury Lane. He declined, preferring to produce original work. &quot;The Bride of Ludgate&quot; (8 December 1832) was the first of several of his plays produced at Drury Lane. The other patent houses also threw their doors open to him (the Adelphi had already done so), and in 1836 Jerrold became the manager of the Strand Theatre with W. J. Hammond, his brother-in-law. The venture was not successful, and the partnership was dissolved. While it lasted, Jerrold wrote his only tragedy, &quot;The Painter of Ghent&quot;, and he appeared in the title role, without much success.

Jerrold acted in the 1851 production of &quot;Not So Bad As We Seem&quot;, a play written by Edward Bulwer, starring many notable Victorians (including Charles Dickens) and attended by Queen Victoria. He continued to write sparkling comedies until 1854, the date of his last piece, &quot;The Heart of Gold&quot;.

==Journalism==

Jerrold wrote for numerous periodicals and gradually became a contributor to the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;, &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;, the &quot;New Monthly&quot;, and &quot;The&quot; &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. To &quot;Punch&quot;, the publication which of all others is associated with his name, he contributed from its second number in 1841 until within a few days of his death. &quot;Punch&quot; was a humorous and liberal publication. Jerrold&#x27;s liberal and radical perspective was portrayed in the magazine under the pseudonym &#x27;Q&#x27;, which used satire to attack institutions of the day. &quot;Punch&quot; was also the forum in which he published in the 1840s his comic series &quot;Mrs Caudle&#x27;s Curtain Lectures&quot;, which was later published in book form.

He contributed many articles for &quot;Punch&quot; under different pseudonyms. On 13 July 1850 he wrote as &#x27;Mrs Amelia Mouser&#x27; about the forthcoming Great Exhibition of 1851, coining the phrase the &quot;palace of very crystal&quot;. From that day forward, The Crystal Palace, at that time still a proposal from his friend Joseph Paxton, gained the name from which it would henceforth be known.

He founded and edited for some time, with indifferent success, the &quot;Illuminated Magazine&quot;, &quot;Jerrold&#x27;s Shilling Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Douglas Jerrold&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper&quot;; and under his editorship from 1852, &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Weekly Newspaper&quot; rose from almost nonentity to a circulation of 182,000. The history of his later years is little more than a catalogue of his literary productions, interrupted now and again by brief visits to the Continent or to the country.

== Death and legacy ==
Douglas Jerrold died at his house, Kilburn Priory, in London on 8 June 1857 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery, where Charles Dickens was a pall-bearer. Dickens gave a public reading and performances of the drama &quot;The Frozen Deep&quot; to raise money for his widow. The first article of the first issue of the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; (November 1857) is a lengthy obituary for Jerrold.

Jerrold&#x27;s figure was small and spare, and in later years he was bowed almost to deformity. His features were strongly marked and expressive, from the thin humorous lips to the keen blue eyes, gleaming from beneath the shaggy eyebrows. He was brisk and active, with the careless bluffness of a sailor. Open and sincere, he concealed neither his anger nor his pleasure; to his sailor&#x27;s frankness all polite duplicity was distasteful. The cynical side of his nature he kept for his writings; in private life his hand was always open. In politics Jerrold was a Liberal, and he gave eager sympathy to Lajos Kossuth, Giuseppe Mazzini and Louis Blanc. In social politics especially he took an eager part; he never tired of declaiming against the horrors of war, the luxury of bishops, or the iniquity of capital punishment.

Jerrold is now perhaps better known from his reputation as a brilliant wit in conversation than from his writings. As a dramatist he was very popular, though his plays have not kept the stage. He dealt with rather humbler forms of social world than had commonly been represented on the boards. He was one of the first and certainly one of the most successful of the men who in defence of the native English drama endeavoured to stem the tide of translation from the French, which threatened early in the 19th century to drown original native talent. His skill in construction and his mastery of epigram and brilliant dialogue are well exemplified in his comedy, &quot;Time Works Wonders&quot; (Haymarket, 26 April 1845). The tales and sketches which form the bulk of Jerrold&#x27;s collected works vary much in skill and interest; but, although there are evident traces of their having been composed from week to week, they are always marked by keen satirical observation and pungent wit.

In 1859 his eldest son William Blanchard Jerrold wrote &quot;Life and Remains of Douglas Jerrold&quot; (1859). His son also edited &quot;The Wit and Opinions of Douglas Jerrold&quot; (1858), and &quot;The Works of Douglas Jerrold, with a memoir by his son, W. B. Jerrold&quot;, in 1863–64, which was never completed. Among the numerous selections from his tales and witticisms are two edited by his grandson, Walter Jerrold, &quot;Bons Mots of Charles Lamb and Douglas Jerrold&quot; (1904), and &quot;The Essays of Douglas Jerrold&quot; (1903), illustrated by H. M. Brock. 

Jerrold was the great-grandfather of Audrey Mayhew Allen (b. 1870), author of children&#x27;s stories published in various periodicals and of &quot;Gladys in Grammarland&quot;, an imitation of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice in&quot; &quot;Wonderland&quot; books.

<text>Robert William Elliston (7 April 1774 – 7 July 1831) was an English actor and theatre manager.

==Life==
He was born in London, the son of a watchmaker. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, but ran away from home and made his first appearance on the stage as Tressel in &quot;Richard III&quot; at the Old Orchard Street Theatre in Bath in 1791. There he was later seen as Romeo, and in other leading parts, both comic and tragic, and he repeated his successes in London from 1796. In the same year he married Elizabeth, the sister of Mary Ann Rundall, and they would in time have ten children.

He acted at Drury Lane from 1804 to 1809, and again from 1812. From 1819 he was the lessee of the house, presenting Edmund Kean, Mme Vestris, and Macready.

He bought the Olympic Theatre in 1813 and also had an interest in a patent theatre, the Theatre Royal, Birmingham. Ill-health and misfortune culminated in his bankruptcy in 1826, when he made his last appearance at Drury Lane as Falstaff. As the lessee of the Surrey Theatre, he acted almost up to his death in 1831, which was hastened by alcoholism. At the Surrey, where he was the lessee first from 1806–14 and then again beginning in 1827, to avoid the patent restrictions on drama outside the West End, he presented Shakespeare and other plays accompanied by ballet music.

Leigh Hunt compared him favorably as an actor with David Garrick; Lord Byron thought him inimitable in high comedy; and Macready praised his versatility.

Elliston was the author of &quot;The Venetian Outlaw&quot; (1805), and, with Francis Godolphin Waldron, of &quot;No Prelude&quot; (1803), in both of which plays he appeared.

His son was Henry Twiselton Elliston.

<doc id="383561" wikidata="Q28495" url="?curid=383561" title="François, Duke of Guise">
<text>François de Lorraine, 2nd Duke of Guise, 1st Prince of Joinville, and 1st Duke of Aumale (17 February 1519 – 24 February 1563), was a French general and statesman. A prominent leader during the Italian War of 1551–1559 and French Wars of Religion, he was assassinated during the siege of Orleans in 1563.

==Early life==
Born in Bar-le-Duc (Lorraine), François was the son of Claude de Lorraine (created Duke of Guise in 1527), and his wife Antoinette de Bourbon. His sister, Mary of Guise, was the wife of James V of Scotland and mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. His younger brother was Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine. He was the youthful cousin of Henry II of France, with whom he was raised, and by birth a prominent individual in France, though his detractors emphasised his &quot;foreign&quot; origin (he was a &quot;prince étranger&quot;), namely the Duchy of Lorraine.

In 1545, Guise (he is henceforth referred to by his title) was seriously wounded at the Second Siege of Boulogne, but recovered. He was struck with a lance through the bars of his helmet. The steel head pierced both cheeks, and of the shaft were snapped off by the violence of the blow. He sat firm in his saddle, and rode back unassisted to his tent; and when the surgeon thought he would die of pain, when the iron was extracted, &#x27;he bore it as easily as if it had been but the plucking of a hair out of his head.&#x27; The scar would earn him the nickname &quot;Le Balafré&quot; (&quot;The Scarred One&quot;).

In 1548 he married Anna d&#x27;Este, in a magnificent wedding. She was the daughter of Duke Ercole II d&#x27;Este of Ferrara and Princess Renée de France, daughter of King Louis XII.

==Military career==

In 1551, he was created Grand Chamberlain of France. He won international renown in 1552 when he successfully defended the city of Metz from the forces of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and defeated the imperial troops again at the Battle of Renty in 1554. but the Truce of Vaucelles temporarily curtailed his military activity.

He led an army into Italy in 1557 to aid Pope Paul IV, operating in conjunction with Brissac to capture Valenza. There they parted ways. Guise continued east along the Po Valley with 16,000 men. Under instructions to take Parma, he assessed that as unfeasible, and instead proposed attacking Florence to secure lines south. The duke of Tuscany, fearing such a possibility, diplomatically reached out to Henry II and Guise was informed of the negotiations. Advancing into Naples in April, his troops became restless from lack of pay. Hearing reports that Alba was marching along the Adriatic coast with an army of 18,000 aiming to cut his supply, Guise sought battle, but Alba was evasive. Guise was now instructed by king Henry to break off his Naples campaign and return to his campaign in Lombardy. This order in turn was superseded by the disastrous defeat of Montmorency at the Battle of St. Quentin. 

Guise was recalled to France, and hurriedly made Lieutenant-General. Taking the field, he captured Calais from the English on 7 January 1558—an enormous propaganda victory for France—then Thionville and Arlon that summer, and was preparing to advance into Luxembourg when the Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis was signed. Throughout the reign of Henry II, Guise was one of the premier military figures of France, courteous, affable, and frank, and largely popular, the &quot;grand duc de Guise&quot; as his contemporary Brantôme called him.

The accession of Francis II of France (10 July 1559), husband of Guise&#x27;s niece Mary, Queen of Scots, was a triumph for the Guise family. Montmorency, conscious there was no place for him in the new order, withdrew from court. The Duke of Guise and his brother, Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine were supreme in the royal council. Occasionally he signed public acts in the royal manner, with his baptismal name only.

==The Wars of Religion==
In reaction to the dominating power at court of the ultra-Catholic Guises, La Renaudie, a Protestant gentleman of Périgord, perhaps with the indirect encouragement of Louis of Bourbon, Prince of Condé, organised a palace coup, the conspiracy of Amboise, to seize the person of the Duke of Guise and his brother Charles, the Cardinal of Lorraine. When the ill-organised plot was put off for six days, it was discovered by the court well ahead of time. On 12 March 1560, the Huguenots stormed the Château d&#x27;Amboise, to which the Guises had moved the young king and queen for safety. The uprising was violently suppressed, with 1,200 executed, many within sight of the castle. In the immediate aftermath Condé was obliged to flee the court, and the power of the Guises was supreme. The discourse which Coligny, leader of the Huguenots, pronounced against &quot;les Guises&quot; in the Assembly of Notables at Fontainebleau (August 1560), did not influence King Francis II in the least, but resulted rather in the imprisonment of Condé, at Charles&#x27;s behest.

However, the king died on 5 December 1560, making Mary, Queen of Scots a widow, and of little political importance. The Guises lost status alongside her, thus making a year full of calamity for the Guises both in Scotland and France. Within a year and a half, their influence waxed great and waned. After the accession of Charles IX, the Duke of Guise lived in retirement on his estates. 

The regent, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, was at first inclined to favour the Protestants. To defend the Catholic cause, the Duke of Guise, together with his old enemy, the Constable de Montmorency and the Maréchal de Saint-André formed the so-called triumvirate opposed to the policy of concessions which Catherine de&#x27; Medici attempted to inaugurate in favour of the Protestants. His former military hero&#x27;s public image was changing: &quot;he could not serve for long as the military executive of this extreme political, ultra-montane, pro-Spanish junta without attracting his share of odium,&quot; N. M. Sutherland has observed in describing the lead-up to his assassination.

The plan of the Triumvirate was to treat with Habsburg Spain and the Holy See, and also to come to an understanding with the Lutheran princes of Germany to induce them to abandon the idea of covertly backing the French Protestants. About July 1561, Guise wrote to this effect to the Duke of Württemberg. The Colloquy at Poissy (September and October 1561) between theologians of the two confessions was fruitless, and the conciliation policy of Catherine de&#x27; Medici was defeated. From 15 to 18 February 1562, Guise visited the Duke of Württemberg at Saverne, and convinced him that if the conference at Poissy had failed, the fault was that of the Calvinists.

As Guise passed through Wassy-sur-Blaise on his way to Paris (1 March 1562), a massacre of Protestants took place. It is not known to what extent he was responsible for this, but the Massacre of Vassy kindled open military conflict in the French Wars of Religion. The siege of Bourges in September was the opening episode, then Rouen was retaken from the Protestants by Guise after a month&#x27;s siege (October); the Battle of Dreux (19 December), at which Montmorency was taken prisoner and Saint-André slain, was in the end turned by Guise to the advantage of the Catholic cause, and Condé, leader of the Huguenots, was taken prisoner.

==Assassination==

In the fourth encounter, Guise was about to take Orléans from the Huguenot supporters of Condé when he was wounded on 18 February 1563 by the Huguenot assassin, Jean de Poltrot de Méré, and died six days later, bled to death by his surgeons, at Château Corney.

It was not the first plot against his life. A hunting accident—Guise had been appointed Grand Veneur of France in 1556—had been planned, as Sir Nicholas Throckmorton informed Queen Elizabeth I of England in May 1560, but the plot was divulged by one of the conspirators who lost his nerve and his five co-conspirators fled.

Guise&#x27;s unexpected death temporarily interrupted open hostilities. In his testimony, Poltrot implicated Coligny and the Protestant pastor Théodore de Bèze. Though the assassin later retracted his statement and Coligny denied responsibility for Guise&#x27;s death, a bitter feud arose between Guise&#x27;s son Henry and Coligny, which culminated in the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre.

==Family==
Guise married Anna d&#x27;Este, daughter of Ercole II d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, and Renée of France, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 29 April 1548. They had seven children:
# Henri (1550–1588), who succeeded him as Duke of Guise.
# Catherine (18 July 1551, Joinville – 6 May 1596, Paris), married on 4 February 1570 Louis, Duke of Montpensier
# Charles, Duke of Mayenne (1554–1611)
# Louis II, Cardinal of Guise (1555–1588), Archbishop of Reims
# Antoine (25 April 1557 – 16 January 1560) died in early childhood.
# François (31 December 1559, Blois – 24 October 1573, Reims) died young without issue.
# Maximilien (25 October 1562) died at birth.

<text>The Treaty of Mersen or [[Meerssen]], concluded on 8 August 870, was a treaty to partition the realm of Lothair II, known as Lotharingia, by his uncles Louis the German of East Francia and Charles the Bald of West Francia, the two surviving sons of Emperor Louis I the Pious. The treaty followed an earlier treaty of Prüm which had split Middle Francia between Lothair I&#x27;s sons after his death in 855.

The treaty is referred to in some Western European historiographies as the third major partition of Francia, all of which took place from August 843 to August 870, through the treaties of Verdun, Prüm and Mersen. It was followed by the Treaty of Ribemont.

==Context==
In 869, Lothair II died without legitimate children, so his heir was his brother, Emperor Louis II of Italy. As Louis was at that time campaigning against the Emirate of Bari, his uncles, Louis the German and Charles the Bald, took his inheritance. Charles had himself crowned in Metz the same year, but was forced by his brother to partition the short-lived Lotharingia, together with the lands Lothair II acquired after the death of Charles of Provence, as they had agreed at Metz in 868.

Their contract of 870 at Meerssen replaced the 843 Treaty of Verdun, after which the Carolingian Empire was also split into three parts, by dividing the northern half of Middle Francia stretching from the Rhone valley to the North Sea, in effect recombining sundered territories of Francia into two larger east and west divisions. However, at this time large parts of the Frisian coast were under Viking control and therefore only divided on paper. The borderline ran roughly along the rivers Meuse, Ourthe, Moselle, Saone and Rhone.

In the north, Louis received most of Lothair&#x27;s Austrasia, with his eastern part including both Aachen and Metz, and most of Frisia. In the south, however, while Louis received most of Upper Burgundy that was left to Lothair (after ceding the southern half to Italy), Charles received Lothair&#x27;s inheritance in Lower Burgundy (including Lyon and Vienne) and a small western part of Upper Burgundy (parts of Portois and Varais (including Besançon)) – this opened him the way to Italy. Louis joined the newly acquired parts of central Austrasia to the subkingdom of his son Louis the Younger in eastern Austrasia, while the illegitimate son of Lothair II, Hugh, was granted the Duchy of Alsace.

==Previous treaties==
===Division of 843===
The empire of Louis the Pious, son of Charlemagne, had originally split in three parts by the 843 Treaty of Verdun:

 Lothair I, his eldest son, received the Imperial crown and the personal realm of Middle Francia

 Louis the German († 876), the second born son, received East Francia (which would evolve into the Kingdom of Germany)

 Charles the Bald († 877), his half-brother, received West Francia (which would evolve into the Kingdom of France), although this was disputed by Pepin II of Aquitaine until he was captured

===Division of 855===

Upon the death of Lothair I in 855, his realm of Middle Francia was partitioned between his sons by the Treaty of Prüm:

 Louis II of Italy († 875), the eldest son, received the imperial crown and Italy

 Charles of Provence († 863) became King of Provence (Lower Burgundy and Provence proper), later partitioned by Louis II and Lothair II

 Lothair II († 869) received Austrasia (the central part still controlled by his father after Verdun), Frisia and Upper Burgundy – this realm came to be named &quot;Lotharii Regnum&quot; (Lotharingia)

East Francia and West Francia remained as before:

 Louis the German († 876) ruled East Francia

 Charles the Bald († 877) ruled West Francia

Lothair II ceded the southeastern parts of Upper Burgundy to his brothers, whereupon Charles of Provence received the bishoprics of Belley and Tarentaise in 858, and Louis II of Italy the bishoprics of Geneva, Lausanne and Sion the next year.

===Division of 863===

Charles of Provence, who suffered from epilepsy, died heirless in 863, and his kingdom was partitioned between his brothers. Lothair II received the western Lower Burgundian parts (bishoprics of Lyon, Vienne, Vivarais and Uzès) which were bordering his western Upper Burgundy (remnants of his original Burgundian possessions), while Louis II received the rest of the Kingdom of Provence.

==Legacy==
The arrangement did not endure more than ten years. Upon the death of Louis the German in 876, Charles the Bald, by then King of Italy and Emperor, attacked eastern Lotharingia, but was defeated by Louis the Younger in the Battle of Andernach (876). In turn, after Charles the Bald had died and his successors struggled to consolidate their rule over West Francia, Louis the Younger campaigned in western Lotharingia in 879. Charles&#x27;s grandsons were forced to cede the whole of Lotharingia to him, sealed by the 880 Treaty of Ribemont, according to which it finally became part of East Francia.

<text>Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (; 15 February 1811 – 11 September 1888) was an Argentine activist, intellectual, writer, statesman and President of Argentina. His writing spanned a wide range of genres and topics, from journalism to autobiography, to political philosophy and history. He was a member of a group of intellectuals, known as the &quot;Generation of 1837&quot;, who had a great influence on 19th-century Argentina. He was particularly concerned with educational issues and was also an important influence on the region&#x27;s literature.

Sarmiento grew up in a poor but politically active family that paved the way for many of his future accomplishments. Between 1843 and 1850, he was frequently in exile, and wrote in both Chile and in Argentina. His greatest literary achievement was &quot;Facundo&quot;, a critique of Juan Manuel de Rosas, that Sarmiento wrote while working for the newspaper &quot;El Progreso&quot; during his exile in Chile. The book brought him far more than just literary recognition; he expended his efforts and energy on the war against dictatorships, specifically that of Rosas, and contrasted enlightened Europe—a world where, in his eyes, democracy, social services, and intelligent thought were valued—with the barbarism of the &quot;gaucho&quot; and especially the &quot;caudillo&quot;, the ruthless strongmen of nineteenth-century Argentina.

While president of Argentina from 1868 to 1874, Sarmiento championed intelligent thought—including education for children and women—and democracy for Latin America. He also took advantage of the opportunity to modernize and develop train systems, a postal system, and a comprehensive education system. He spent many years in ministerial roles on the federal and state levels where he travelled abroad and examined other education systems.

Sarmiento died in Asunción, Paraguay, at the age of 77 from a heart attack. He was buried in Buenos Aires. Today, he is respected as a political innovator and writer. Miguel de Unamuno considered him among the greatest writers of Castilian prose.

== Youth and influences ==
Sarmiento was born in Carrascal, a poor suburb of San Juan, Argentina on 15 February 1811. His father, José Clemente Quiroga Sarmiento y Funes, had served in the military during the wars of independence, returning prisoners of war to San Juan. His mother, Doña Paula Zoila de Albarracín e Irrazábal, was a very pious woman, who lost her father at a young age and was left with very little to support herself. As a result, she took to selling her weaving in order to afford to build a house of her own. On 21 September 1801, José and Paula were married. They had 15 children, 9 of whom died young; Domingo was the only son to survive to adulthood. Sarmiento was greatly influenced by his parents, his mother who was always working hard, and his father who told stories of being a patriot and serving his country, something Sarmiento strongly believed in. In Sarmiento&#x27;s own words:

At the age of four, Sarmiento was taught to read by his father and his uncle, José Eufrasio Quiroga Sarmiento, who later became Bishop of Cuyo. Another uncle who influenced him in his youth was Domingo de Oro, a notable figure in the young Argentine Republic who was influential in bringing Juan Manuel de Rosas to power. Though Sarmiento did not follow de Oro&#x27;s political and religious leanings, he learned the value of intellectual integrity and honesty. He developed scholarly and oratorical skills, qualities which de Oro was famous for.
In 1816, at the age of five, Sarmiento began attending the primary school &quot;La Escuela de la Patria&quot;. He was a good student, and earned the title of First Citizen (&quot;Primer Ciudadano&quot;) of the school. After completing primary school, his mother wanted him to go to Córdoba to become a priest. He had spent a year reading the Bible and often spent time as a child helping his uncle with church services, but Sarmiento soon became bored with religion and school, and got involved with a group of aggressive children. Sarmiento&#x27;s father took him to the Loreto Seminary in 1821, but for reasons unknown, Sarmiento did not enter the seminary, returning instead to San Juan with his father. In 1823, the Minister of State, Bernardino Rivadavia, announced that the six top pupils of each state would be selected to receive higher education in Buenos Aires. Sarmiento was at the top of the list in San Juan, but it was then announced that only ten pupils would receive the scholarship. The selection was made by lot, and Sarmiento was not one of the scholars whose name was drawn.

Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.

==Political background and exiles==
In 1826, an assembly elected Bernardino Rivadavia as president of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. This action roused the ire of the provinces, and civil war was the result. Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to two opposing groups. The wealthy and educated of the Unitarian Party, such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. In opposition to them were the Federalists, who were mainly based in rural areas and tended to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as Manuel Dorrego and Juan Facundo Quiroga among their ranks, they were in favor of a loose federation with more autonomy for the individual provinces.

Opinion of the Rivadavia government was divided between the two ideologies. For Unitarians like Sarmiento, Rivadavia&#x27;s presidency was a positive experience. He set up a European-staffed university and supported a public education program for rural male children. He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the &quot;gauchos&quot; were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.

In 1827, the Unitarians were challenged by Federalist forces. After the resignation of Rivadavia, Manuel Dorrego was installed as governor of Buenos Aires province. He quickly made peace with Brazil but, on returning to Argentina, was overthrown and executed by the Unitarian general Juan Lavalle, who took Dorrego&#x27;s place. However, Lavalle did not spend long as governor either: he was soon overthrown by militias composed largely of &quot;gauchos&quot; led by Rosas and Estanislao López. By the end of 1829 the old legislature that Lavalle had disbanded was back in place and had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires.

The first time Sarmiento was forced to leave home was with his uncle, José de Oro, in 1827, because of his military activities. José de Oro was a priest who had fought in the Battle of Chacabuco under General San Martín. Together, Sarmiento and de Oro went to San Francisco del Monte de Oro, in the neighbour province of San Luis. He spent much of his time with his uncle learning and began to teach at the only school in town. Later that year, his mother wrote to him asking him to come home. Sarmiento refused, only to receive a response from his father that he was coming to collect him. His father had persuaded the governor of San Juan to send Sarmiento to Buenos Aires to study at the College of Moral Sciences (&quot;Colegio de Ciencias Morales&quot;).

Soon after Sarmiento&#x27;s return, the province of San Juan broke out into civil war and Facundo Quiroga invaded Sarmiento&#x27;s town. As historian William Katra describes this &quot;traumatic experience&quot;:

Unable to attend school in Buenos Aires due to the political turmoil, Sarmiento chose to fight against Quiroga. He joined and fought in the unitarian army, only to be placed under house arrest when San Juan was eventually taken over by Quiroga after the battle of Pilar. He was later released, only to join the forces of General Paz, a key unitarian figure.

===First exile in Chile===

Fighting and war soon resumed, but, one by one, Quiroga vanquished the main allies of General Paz, including the Governor of San Juan, and in 1831 Sarmiento fled to Chile. He did not return to Argentina for five years. At the time, Chile was noted for its good public administration, its constitutional organization, and the rare freedom to criticize the regime. In Sarmiento&#x27;s view, Chile had &quot;Security of property, the continuation of order, and with both of these, the love of work and the spirit of enterprise that causes the development of wealth and prosperity.&quot;

As a form of freedom of expression, Sarmiento began to write political commentary. In addition to writing, he also began teaching in Los Andes. Due to his innovative style of teaching, he found himself in conflict with the governor of the province. He founded his own school in Pocuro as a response to the governor. During this time, Sarmiento fell in love and had an illegitimate daughter named Ana Faustina, who Sarmiento did not acknowledge until she married.

===San Juan and second and third exiles in Chile===



In 1836, Sarmiento returned to San Juan, seriously ill with typhoid fever; his family and friends thought he would die upon his return, but he recovered and established an anti-federalist journal called &quot;El Zonda&quot;. The government of San Juan did not like Sarmiento&#x27;s criticisms and censored the magazine by imposing an unaffordable tax upon each purchase. Sarmiento was forced to cease publication of the magazine in 1840. He also founded a school for girls during this time called the Santa Rosa High School, which was a preparatory school. In addition to the school, he founded a Literary Society.

It is around this time that Sarmiento became associated with the so-called &quot;Generation of 1837&quot;. This was a group of activists, who included Esteban Echeverría, Juan Bautista Alberdi, and Bartolomé Mitre, who spent much of the 1830s to 1880s first agitating for and then bringing about social change, advocating republicanism, free trade, freedom of speech, and material progress. Though, based in San Juan, Sarmiento was absent from the initial creation of this group, in 1838 he wrote to Alberdi seeking the latter&#x27;s advice; and in time he would become the group&#x27;s most fervent supporter.

In 1840, after being arrested and accused of conspiracy, Sarmiento was forced into exile in Chile again. It was en route to Chile that, in the baths of Zonda, he wrote the graffiti &quot;On ne tue point les idées,&quot; an incident that would later serve as the preface to his book &quot;Facundo&quot;. Once on the other side of the Andes, in 1841 Samiento started writing for the Valparaíso newspaper , as well working as a publisher of the &quot;Crónica Contemporánea de Latino América&quot; (&quot;Contemporary Latin American Chronicle&quot;). In 1842, Sarmiento was appointed the Director of the first Normal School in South America; the same year he also founded the newspaper &quot;El Progreso&quot;. During this time he sent for his family from San Juan to Chile. In 1843, Sarmiento published &quot;Mi Defensa&quot; (&quot;My Defence&quot;), while continuing to teach. And in May 1845, &quot;El Progreso&quot; started the serial publication of the first edition of his best-known work, &quot;Facundo&quot;; in July, &quot;Facundo&quot; appeared in book form.

Between the years 1845 and 1847, Sarmiento travelled on behalf of the Chilean government across parts of South America to Uruguay, Brazil, to Europe, France, Spain, Algeria, Italy, Armenia, Switzerland, England, to Cuba, and to North America, the United States and Canada in order to examine different education systems and the levels of education and communication. Sarmiento began his visit to the United States with a mere six hundred dollars from the Chilean government, much of the former allowance being expended on preceding journeys to Africa and Europe. As a result, he planned to visit as much of the country as financially possible and end his journey in Havana, where he would take the role of a teacher and journalist to earn more funds to finance future journeys across the American continents. However, Sarmiento discarded this plan upon meeting Santiago Arcos, a Chilean journalist who agreed to defraying the expenses of subsequent journeys. Sarmiento initially could not locate or find any information about the whereabouts of Arcos, but the two eventually met in Philadelphia. During his visit to the United States, Sarmiento visited major locations such as Boston, Washington, D.C., and New Orleans. Sarmiento would again travel to the United States from the years 1865 to 1868 when serving as Argentina&#x27;s minister plenipotentiary to the country. Based on his travels, he wrote the book &quot;Viajes por Europa, África, y América&quot; which was published in 1849.

In 1848, Sarmiento voluntarily left to Chile once again. During the same year, he met widow Benita Martínez Pastoriza, married her, and adopted her son, Domingo Fidel, or Dominguito, who would be killed in action during the War of the Triple Alliance at Curupaytí in 1866. Sarmiento continued to exercise the idea of freedom of the press and began two new periodicals entitled &quot;La Tribuna&quot; and &quot;La Crónica&quot; respectively, which strongly attacked Juan Manuel de Rosas. During this stay in Chile, Sarmiento&#x27;s essays became more strongly opposed to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Argentine government tried to have Sarmiento extradited from Chile to Argentina, but the Chilean government refused to hand him over.

In 1850, he published both &quot;Argirópolis&quot; and &quot;Recuerdos de Provincia&quot; (Recollections of a Provincial Past). In 1852, Rosas&#x27;s regime was finally brought down. Sarmiento became involved in debates about the country&#x27;s new constitution.

===Return to Argentina===

In 1854, Sarmiento briefly visited Mendoza, just across the border from Chile in Western Argentina, but he was arrested and imprisoned. Upon his release, he went back to Chile. But in 1855 he put an end to what was now his &quot;self-imposed&quot; exile in Chile: he arrived in Buenos Aires, soon to become editor-in-chief of the newspaper &quot;El Nacional&quot;. He was also appointed town councillor in 1856, and 1857 he joined the provincial Senate, a position he held until 1861.

It was in 1861, shortly after Mitre became Argentine president, that Sarmiento left Buenos Aires and returned to San Juan, where he was elected governor, a post he took up in 1862. It was then that he passed the &quot;Statutory Law of Public Education&quot;, making it mandatory for children to attend primary school. It allowed for a number of institutions to be opened including secondary schools, military schools and an all-girls school. While governor, he developed roads and infrastructure, built public buildings and hospitals, encouraged agriculture and allowed for mineral mining. He resumed his post as editor of &quot;El Zonda&quot;. In 1863, Sarmiento fought against the power of the &quot;caudillo&quot; of La Rioja and found himself in conflict with the Interior Minister of General Mitre&#x27;s government, Guillermo Rawson. Sarmiento stepped down as governor of San Juan to become the Plenipotentiary Minister to the United States, where he was sent in 1865, soon after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Moved by the story of Lincoln, Sarmiento ended up writing his book &quot;Vida de Lincoln&quot;. It was on this trip that Sarmiento received an honorary degree from the University of Michigan. A bust of him stood in the Modern Languages Building at the University of Michigan until multiple student protests prompted its removal. Students installed plaques and painted the bust red to represent the controversies surrounding his policies towards the indigenous people in Argentina. There still stands a statue of Sarmiento at Brown University. While on this trip, he was asked to run for President again. He won, taking office on 12 October 1868.

== President of Argentina, 1868–1874==

Domingo Faustino Sarmiento served as President of the Republic of Argentina from 1868 to 1874, becoming president despite the maneuverings of his predecessor Bartolomé Mitre. According to biographer Allison Bunkley, his presidency &quot;marks the advent of the middle, or land-owning classes as the pivot power of the nation. The age of the gaucho had ended, and the age of the merchant and cattleman had begun.&quot; Sarmiento sought to create basic freedoms, and wanted to ensure civil safety and progress for everyone, not just the few. Sarmiento&#x27;s tour of the United States had given him many new ideas about politics, democracy, and the structure of society, especially when he was the Argentine ambassador to the country from 1865 to 1868. He found New England, specifically the Boston-Cambridge area to be the source of much of his influence, writing in an Argentine newspaper that New England was &quot;the cradle of the modern republic, the school for all of America.&quot; He described Boston as &quot;The pioneer city of the modern world, the Zion of the ancient Puritans ... Europe contemplates in New England the power which in the future will supplant her.&quot; Not only did Sarmiento evolve political ideas, but also structural ones by transitioning Argentina from a primarily agricultural economy to one focused on cities and industry.

Historian David Rock notes that, beyond putting an end to caudillismo, Sarmiento&#x27;s main achievements in government concerned his promotion of education. Sarmiento&#x27;s focus on education became a divisive tool of his nation-building strategy. With this focus, he was able to build the foundation to promote the intellect of future generations and securing their prosperity. There was an emphasis on constructing educational buildings, and training prospective teachers. His emphasis on constructing these schools and promoting education served as an example for future administrations to build upon. As stated by Garrard, Henderson, and McCann, this foundation would eventually make &quot;the Argentine people among the most literate in the hemisphere.&quot; As Rock reports, &quot;between 1868 and 1874 educational subsidies from the central government to the provinces quadrupled.&quot; He established 800 educational and military institutions, and his improvements to the educational system enabled 100,000 children to attend school.

He also pushed forward modernization more generally, building infrastructure including of telegraph line across the country for improved communications, making it easier for the government in Buenos Aires and the provinces to communicate; modernizing the postal and train systems which he believed to be integral for interregional and national economies, as well as building the Red Line, a train line that would bring goods to Buenos Aires in order to better facilitate trade with Great Britain. By the end of his presidency, the Red Line extended . In 1869, he conducted Argentina&#x27;s first national census.

Although the rapid expansion of the railroad promoted trade, Latin America saw a rise in inequality and an intensified pressure to drive indigenous people from their land in order to expand the economy. With the expansion of the railroad itself came an expansion of exploration, stimulated by the access to previously inaccessible lands. Sarmiento&#x27;s successor, Nicolas Avellaneda, further promoted this policy. In the late 1870s Julio Roca, his minister of war, carried out the Conquest of the Desert. This war, stimulated by the expansion of Latin American railroads, was waged against the indigenous people of Southern Argentina. In addition to the expansion and driving out that was done by the people, the government had now officially declared its intentions. Following the model of displacement that had been outlined by North America, the Conquest of the Desert established the dominance of Argentina as a nation-state, and set a dangerous precedent. With this precedent, Argentine dominance cost the killing and displacement of the Mapuche people in the Patagonia providence. Though Sarmiento promoted modernization and growth that made Argentina stronger, the idea of expansion meant the expulsion and killings of indigenous peoples.

Though Sarmiento is well known historically, he was not a popular president. Indeed, Rock judges that &quot;by and large his administration was a disappointment&quot;. During his presidency, Argentina conducted an unpopular war against Paraguay; at the same time, people were displeased with him for not fighting for the Straits of Magellan from Chile. Although he increased productivity, he increased expenditures, which also negatively affected his popularity. In addition, the arrival of a large influx of European immigrants was blamed for the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Buenos Aires and the risk of civil war. Moreover, Sarmiento&#x27;s presidency was further marked by ongoing rivalry between Buenos Aires and the provinces. In the war against Paraguay, Sarmiento&#x27;s adopted son was killed. Sarmiento suffered from immense grief and was thought to never have been the same again.

On 22 August 1873, Sarmiento was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt, when two Italian anarchist brothers shot at his coach. They had been hired by federal caudillo Ricardo López Jordán. A year later in 1874, he completed his term as President and stepped down, handing his presidency over to Nicolás Avellaneda, his former Minister of Education.

==Final years==

In 1875, following his term as President, Sarmiento became the General Director of Schools for the Province of Buenos Aires. That same year, he became the Senator for San Juan, a post that he held until 1879, when he became Interior Minister. But he soon resigned, following conflict with the Governor of Buenos Aires, Carlos Tejedor. He then assumed the post of Superintendent General of Schools for the National Education Ministry under President Roca and published &quot;El Monitor de la Educación Común&quot;, which is a fundamental reference for Argentine education. In 1882, Sarmiento was successful in passing the sanction of Free Education allowing schools to be free, mandatory, and separate from that of religion.

In May 1888, Sarmiento left Argentina for Paraguay. He was accompanied by his daughter, Ana, and his companion Aurelia Vélez. He died in Asunción on 11 September 1888, from a heart attack, and was buried in Buenos Aires, after a ten-day trip. His tomb at La Recoleta Cemetery lies under a sculpture, a condor upon a pylon, designed by himself and executed by Victor de Pol. Pedro II, the Emperor of Brazil and a great admirer of Sarmiento, sent to his funeral procession a green and gold crown of flowers with a message written in Spanish remembering the highlights of his life: &quot;Civilization and Barbarism, Tonelero, Monte Caseros, Petrópolis, Public Education. Remembrance and Homage from Pedro de Alcântara.&quot;

== Philosophy ==

Sarmiento was well known for his modernization of the country, and for his improvements to the educational system. He firmly believed in democracy and European liberalism, but was most often seen as a romantic. Sarmiento was well versed in Western philosophy including the works of Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill. He was particularly fascinated with the liberty given to those living in the United States, which he witnessed as a representative of the Peruvian government. He did, however, see pitfalls to liberty, pointing for example to the aftermath of the French Revolution, which he compared to Argentina&#x27;s own May Revolution. He believed that liberty could turn into anarchy and thus civil war, which is what happened in France and in Argentina. Therefore, his use of the term &quot;liberty&quot; was more in reference to a laissez-faire approach to the economy, and religious liberty. Though a Catholic himself, he began to adopt the ideas of separation of church and state modeled after the US. He believed that there should be more religious freedom, and less religious affiliation in schools. This was one of many ways in which Sarmiento tried to connect South America to North America.
Sarmiento believed that the material and social needs of people had to be satisfied but not at the cost of order and decorum. He put great importance on law and citizen participation. These ideas he most equated to Rome and to the United States, a society which he viewed as exhibiting similar qualities. In order to civilize the Argentine society and make it equal to that of Rome or the United States, Sarmiento believed in eliminating the caudillos, or the larger landholdings and establishing multiple agricultural colonies run by European immigrants.

Coming from a family of writers, orators, and clerics, Domingo Sarmiento placed a great value on education and learning. He opened a number of schools including the first school in Latin America for teachers in Santiago in 1842: &quot;La Escuela Normal Preceptores de Chile&quot;. He proceeded to open 18 more schools and had mostly female teachers from the United States come to Argentina to instruct graduates how to be effective when teaching. Sarmiento&#x27;s belief was that education was the key to happiness and success, and that a nation could not be democratic if it was not educated. &quot;We must educate our rulers,&quot; he said. &quot;An ignorant people will always choose Rosas.&quot;. His views on the South American Indians have been more controversial, with some scholars arguing Sarmiento&#x27;s views reflected the racism of his day. For example, in the periodical &quot;El Nacional,&quot; dated November 25, 1857, Sarmiento wrote: “Will we be able to exterminate the Indians? For the savages of America, I feel an invincible repugnance that I cannot cure. Those scoundrels are not anything more than disgusting Indians that I would hang if they reappeared. Lautaro and Caupolicán are dirty Indians, because that&#x27;s how they are all. Incapable of progress, their extermination is providential and useful, sublime and great. They must be exterminated without even sparing the little one, who already has the instinctive hatred for the civilized man.”

== Publications ==

===Major works===

* Facundo – Civilización y Barbarie – Vida de Juan Facundo Quiroga, 1845. Written during his long exile in Chile. Originally published in 1845 in Chile in installments in &quot;El Progreso&quot; newspaper, &quot;Facundo&quot; is Sarmiento&#x27;s most famous work. It was first published in book form in 1851, and the first English translation, by Mary Mann, appeared in 1868. A recent modern edition in English was translated by Kathleen Ross. &quot;Facundo&quot; promotes further civilization and European influence on Argentine culture through the use of anecdotes and references to Juan Facundo Quiroga, Argentine caudillo general. As well as being a call to progress, Sarmiento discusses the nature of Argentine peoples as well as including his thoughts and objections to Juan Manuel de Rosas, governor of Buenos Aires from 1829 to 1832 and again from 1835, due to the turmoil generated by Facundo&#x27;s death, to 1852. As literary critic Sylvia Molloy observes, Sarmiento claimed that this book helped explain Argentine struggles to European readers, and was cited in European publications. Written with extensive assistance from others, Sarmiento adds to his own memory the quotes, accounts, and dossiers from other historians and companions of Facundo Quiroga. &quot;Facundo&quot; maintains its relevance in modern-day as well, bringing attention to the contrast of lifestyles in Latin America, the conflict and struggle for progress while maintaining tradition, as well as the moral and ethical treatment of the public by government officials and regimes. Let us move onto more precise reasons why the book was created. Sarmiento sought to understand why the two sides in Argentina fought ongoing civil wars. The book contrasts the rural world, where the Indian and gaucho were central, with the urban world of Buenos Aires, seen as an enlightened cultural model. Sarmiento explored the tensions between these two worlds in shaping the nation. He argued that Argentina’s scientific and industrial backwardness mirrored Spain’s, both due to a lingering attachment to medievalism. At the core of this backwardness was the dominance of Catholic dogmas. Sarmiento’s analysis examined how these factors contributed to the social and political crises of his time.
* Recuerdos de Provincia (&quot;Recollections of a Provincial Past&quot;), 1850. In this second autobiography, Sarmiento displays a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, in contrast to &quot;Mi defensa&quot;, choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. &quot;Recuerdos&quot; discusses his Similar to &quot;Facundo&quot;, Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing &quot;Recuerdos&quot; and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento&#x27;s persuasion in this book is substantial. The accounts, whether all true or false against him, are a source of information to write &quot;Recuerdos&quot; as he is then able to object and rectify into what he creates as a &#x27;true account&#x27; of autobiography.

===Other works===

Sarmiento was a prolific author. The following is a selection of his other works:

* &quot;Mi defensa&quot;, 1843. This was Sarmiento&#x27;s first autobiography in a pamphlet form, which omits any substantial information or recognition of his illegitimate daughter Ana. This would have discredited Sarmiento as a respected father of Argentina, as Sarmiento portrays himself as a sole individual, disregarding or denouncing important ties to other people and groups in his life.
* &quot;Viajes por Europa, África, y América&quot; 1849. A description and observations while travelling as a representative of the Chilean government to learn more about educational systems around the world.
* &quot;Argirópolis&quot; 1850. A description of a future utopian city in the River Plate States.
* &quot;Comentarios sobre la constitución&quot; 1852. This is Sarmiento&#x27;s official account of his ideologies promoting civilization and the &quot;Europeanization&quot; and &quot;Americanization&quot; of Argentina. This account includes dossiers, articles, speeches and information regarding the pending constitution.
* &quot;Informes sobre educación&quot;, 1856. This report was the first official statistic report on education in Latin America includes information on gender and location distribution of pupils, salaries and wages, and comparative achievement. &quot;Informes sobre educación&quot; proposes new theories, plans, and methods of education as well as quality controls on schools and learning systems.
* &quot;Las Escuelas, base de la prosperidad y de la republica en los Estados Unidos&quot; 1864. This work, along with the previous two, were intended to persuade Latin America and Argentines of the benefits of the educational, economic and political systems of the United States, which Sarmiento supported.
* &quot;Conflicto y armonías de las razas en América&quot; 1883, deals with race issues in Latin America in the late 1800s. While situations in the book remain particular to the time period and location, race issues and conflicts of races are still prevalent and enable the book to be relevant in the present day.
* &quot;Vida de Dominguito&quot;, 1886. A memoir of Dominguito, Sarmiento&#x27;s adopted son who was the only child Sarmiento had always accepted. Many of the notes used to compile &quot;Vida de Dominguito&quot; had been written 20 years prior during one of Sarmiento&#x27;s stays in Washington.
* &quot;Educar al soberano&quot;, a compilation of letters written from 1870 to 1886 on the topic of improved education, promoting and suggesting new reforms such as secondary schools, parks, sporting fields and specialty schools. This compilation was met with far greater success than &quot;Ortografía, Instrucción Publica&quot; and received greater public support.
* &quot;El camino de Lacio&quot;, which impacted Argentina by influencing many Italians to immigrate by relating Argentinas history to that of Latium of the Roman empire.
* &quot;Inmigración y colonización&quot;, a publication which led to mass immigration of Europeans to mostly urban Argentina, which Sarmiento believed would assist in &#x27;civilizing&#x27; the country over the more barbaric gauchos and rural provinces. This had a large impact on Argentine politics, especially as much of the civil tension in the country was divided between the rural provinces and the cities. In addition to increased urban population, these European immigrants had a cultural effect upon Argentina, providing what Sarmiento believed to be more civilized culture similar to North America&#x27;s.
* &quot;On the Condition of Foreigners&quot;, which helped to assist political changes for immigrants in 1860.
* &quot;Ortografía, Instrucción Publica&quot;, an example of Sarmiento&#x27;s passion for improved education. Sarmiento focused on illiteracy of the youth, and suggested simplifying reading and spelling for the public education system, a method which was never implemented.
* &quot;Práctica Constitucional&quot;, a three volume work, describing current political methods as well as propositions for new methodologies.
* &quot;Presidential Papers&quot;, a history of his presidency, formed of many personal and external documents.
* &quot;Travels in the United States in 1847&quot;, (Edited and translated into English by Michael Aaron Rockland.)

==Legacy==

The impact of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is most obviously seen in the establishment of September 11 as Panamerican Teacher&#x27;s Day which was done in his honor at the 1943 Interamerican Conference on Education, held in Panama. Today, he is still considered to be Latin America&#x27;s teacher. In his time, he opened countless schools, created free public libraries, opened immigration, and worked towards a Union of Plate States.

His impact was not only on the world of education, but also on Argentine political and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted. He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentine people could not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.

There is a building named in his honor at the Argentine embassy in Washington D.C.

Today, there is a statue in honor of Sarmiento in Boston on the Commonwealth Avenue Mall, between Gloucester and Hereford streets, erected in 1973. There is a square, &quot;Plaza Sarmiento&quot; in Rosario, Argentina. One of Rodin&#x27;s last sculptures was that of Sarmiento which is now in Buenos Aires.

<text>The Treaty or Peace of Oliva (; ; ) was one of the peace treaties ending the Second Northern War (1655–1660). It was signed on . The Treaty of Oliva, the Treaty of Copenhagen in the same year, and the Treaty of Cardis in the following year marked the high point of the Swedish Empire.

At Oliwa (Oliva), Poland, peace was made between Sweden, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Habsburgs and Brandenburg-Prussia. Sweden was accepted as sovereign in Swedish Livonia, Brandenburg was accepted as sovereign in Ducal Prussia and John II Casimir Vasa withdrew his claims to the Swedish throne but was to retain the title of a hereditary Swedish king for life. All occupied territories were restored to their prewar sovereigns. Catholics in Livonia and Prussia were granted religious freedom.

The signatories were the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I, Elector Frederick William I of Brandenburg and King John II Casimir Vasa of Poland. Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, the head of the Swedish delegation and the minor regency, signed on behalf of his nephew, King Charles XI of Sweden, who was still a minor.

==Negotiations==

During the Second Northern War, Poland–Lithuania and Sweden had been engaged in a ravaging war since 1655 and both wanted peace, in order to attend to their remaining enemies, Russia and Denmark, respectively. In addition, the politically ambitious Polish queen Marie Louise Gonzaga, who had great influence over both the King of Poland and Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, wanted a peace with Sweden because she wanted a son of her close relative, the French Louis, Grand Condé, to be elected as successor to the Polish throne. This could only be achieved with the consent of the Kingdom of France and its ally Sweden.

On the other hand, the Danish and Dutch envoys, as well as those of the Holy Roman Empire and Brandenburg, did what they could to derail the proceedings. Their goal was assisted by the drawn-out formalities which always took place at negotiations of this age. Several months elapsed before the actual peace negotiations could begin, on 7 January 1660 (OS). Even then, so many hostile words were written in the documents being exchanged by the two parties that the head negotiator, French ambassador , found himself having to expurgate long sections which otherwise would have caused offense.

A Polish–Lithuanian contingent headed by the archbishop of Gniezno wanted the war to continue in order to expel the exhausted Swedish forces in Livonia. The Danish delegates demanded Poland–Lithuania conclude a treaty together with Denmark; however, the Commonwealth did not want to tie themselves to the outcome of the poor Danish fortunes of war against Sweden. The Habsburgs, which wished to drive Sweden out of Germany through continued warfare, promised Poland–Lithuania reinforcements, but Habsburg intentions were treated with suspicion and the Senate of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth demurred. Even Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg offered assistance to Poland–Lithuania to continue the war, with the hope of conquering Swedish Pomerania.

France, in practice governed by Cardinal Mazarin, wanted a continued Swedish presence in Germany to counterbalance Austria and Spain, which were France&#x27;s traditional enemies. France also feared that a continued war would increase Austria&#x27;s influence in Germany and Poland–Lithuania. The Austrian and Brandenburgian intrusion into Swedish Pomerania was considered a breach of the Peace of Westphalia, which France was under the obligation to prosecute. France therefore threatened to contribute an army of 30,000 soldiers to the Swedish cause unless a treaty between Sweden and Brandenburg was concluded before February 1660.

Negotiations had begun in Toruń (Thorn) in autumn of 1659. The Polish delegation later moved to Gdańsk, and the Swedish delegation made the Baltic town of Sopot (Zoppot) its base.

When news of the death of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden arrived, Poland–Lithuania, Austria, and Brandenburg began to increase their demands. A new French threat of assistance to Sweden, however, finally made Poland–Lithuania give in. The treaty was signed in the monastery of Oliwa on 23 April 1660.
==Terms==
The treaty had John II Casimir renounce his claims to the Swedish crown, which his father Sigismund III Vasa had lost in 1599. Poland–Lithuania also formally ceded to Sweden Livonia and the city of Riga, which had been under Swedish control since the 1620s. The treaty settled conflicts between Sweden and Poland–Lithuania left standing since the War against Sigismund (1598–1599), the Polish–Swedish War (1600–1629) and the Northern Wars (1655–1660). The treaty also secured Swedish dominance over the Baltic.

Brandenburg&#x27;s House of Hohenzollern was also confirmed as independent and sovereign in the Duchy of Prussia. It had previously held the territory as a fief of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. If the Hohenzollern dynasty became extinct in the male line in Prussia, the territory was to revert to the Commonwealth.

The treaty was achieved by Brandenburg&#x27;s diplomat, Christoph Caspar von Blumenthal, on the first diplomatic mission of his career.

<doc id="383572" wikidata="Q712264" url="?curid=383572" title="Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine">
<text>Charles de Lorraine (17 February 1524 – 26 December 1574), Duke of Chevreuse, was a French Cardinal, a member of the powerful House of Guise. He was known at first as the Cardinal of Guise, and then as the second Cardinal of Lorraine, after the death of his uncle, Jean, Cardinal of Lorraine (1550). He was the protector of François Rabelais and Pierre de Ronsard and founded Reims University. He is sometimes known as the Cardinal de Lorraine.

==Biography==
Born in 1524, Joinville, Haute-Marne, Charles of Guise was the son of Claude, Duke of Guise and his wife Antoinette de Bourbon. His older brother was François, Duke of Guise. His sister Mary of Guise was the wife of King James V of Scotland and mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. King Francis I appointed him Archbishop of Reims in 1538.

==Cardinal==
In a political move to draw France closer to the papacy, Pope Paul III created Charles cardinal in July 1547 (the day after the coronation of King Henry II of France, at which he had officiated). He became coadjutor for Bishop of Metz, his uncle Cardinal Jean de Lorraine, on 16 November 1547. Charles&#x27; uncle died on 10 May 1550 and he resigned and was succeeded as Administrator by Cardinal Robert de Lenoncourt.

The efforts of Charles to enforce his family&#x27;s pretensions to the Countship of Provence, and his temporary assumption, with this object, of the title of Cardinal of Anjou were without success. He failed also when he attempted, in 1551, to dissuade Henry II from uniting the Duchy of Lorraine to France. Charles succeeded, however, in creating for his family interests certain political alliances that occasionally seemed in conflict with each other. He coquetted for instance on the one hand with the Lutheran princes of Germany, and on the other his interview (1558) with the Cardinal de Granvelle (at Péronne) initiated friendly relations between the Guises and the royal house of Spain.

In March 1558 de Pierceville wrote to Charles about building works and furnishing of the royal palaces, including the Louvre with tapestry and hangings of cloth of gold and cloth of silver. He wondered how the heraldry of the Cardinal&#x27;s niece Mary, Queen of Scots and the Dauphin should be blazoned, and whether she had an open or imperial crown. The couple were married on 24 April 1558.
In 1562, he attended the Council of Trent. The seigneur de Lanssac, Arnaud du Ferrier, president of the Parlement of Paris, and Guy de Faur de Pibrac, royal counsellor, who represented Charles IX at the council from 26 May 1562, towards the end of the year were joined by the Cardinal Lorraine. He was instructed to arrive at an understanding with the Germans, who proposed to reform the church in head and members and to authorize at once Communion under Both Kinds, prayers in the vernacular and the marriage of the clergy.

In the reform articles which he presented (2 January 1563), he was silent on the last point, but petitioned for the other two. Pius IV was indignant, and the cardinal denounced Rome as the source of all abuses. In the questions of precedence which arose between him and the Spanish ambassador, Count de Luna, Pius IV decided for the latter. However, in September 1563, on a visit to Rome, the cardinal, intent perhaps on securing the pope&#x27;s assistance for the political ambitions of the Guises, professed opinions less decidedly Gallican. Moreover, when he learned that the French ambassadors, who had left the council, were dissatisfied because the papal legates had obtained from the council approval of a project for the &quot;reformation of the princes&quot;, which the latter deemed contrary to the liberties of the Catholic Church in France (the &quot;Gallican church&quot;), he endeavoured, though without success, to bring about the return of the ambassadors, prevailed on the legates to withdraw the objectionable articles and strove to secure the immediate publication in France of the decrees of the council; this, however, was refused by Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

When in 1564, François de Montmorency, royal governor of Paris and his personal enemy, attempted to prevent Charles from entering the capital with an armed escort, the ensuing conflict and the precipitate flight of Charles gave rise to an outcry of derision which obliged him to retire to his diocese for two years. In 1570, he aroused the anger of Charles IX by inducing Duke Henri, the eldest of his nephews, to solicit the hand of Margaret of Valois, the king&#x27;s sister. His share in the negotiations for the marriage between Charles IX and Elizabeth of Austria, and for that of Margaret of Valois with the prince of Navarre, granted him temporary favour. Shortly after the death of Charles IX, the cardinal appeared before his successor, Henry III, but died soon afterwards, at Avignon.

==Legacy==
As the Archbishop of Reims, Charles crowned successively Henry II, Francis II and Charles IX. He had a personal policy which was often at variance with that of the court. This policy rendered him at times an enigma to his contemporaries. The chronicler Pierre de L&#x27;Estoile accused Charles of great duplicity; Brantôme spoke of his &quot;deeply stained soul, churchman though he was&quot;, accused him of skepticism and claimed to have heard him occasionally speak half approvingly of the Confession of Augsburg. 

From 1560, at least twenty-two libelous pamphlets were in circulation and fell into Charles&#x27; hands; they damaged his reputation with posterity as well as among his contemporaries. One of them, &quot;La Guerre Cardinale&quot; (1565), accuses him of seeking to restore to the Holy Roman Empire the three former prince-bishoprics of Metz, Toul and Verdun, in Lorraine, which had been conquered by Henry II. A discourse attributed to Théodore de Bèze (1566) denounced the pluralism of the cardinal in the matter of benefices. He established Reims University and served as François Rabelais and Pierre de Ronsard&#x27;s guardian.

<doc id="383576" wikidata="Q157040" url="?curid=383576" title="Lajos Kossuth">
<text>Lajos Kossuth de Udvard et Kossuthfalva (; ; ; ; 19 September 1802 – 20 March 1894) was a Hungarian nobleman, lawyer, journalist, politician, statesman and governor-president of the Kingdom of Hungary during the revolution of 1848–1849.

With the help of his talent in oratory in political debates and public speeches, Kossuth emerged from a poor gentry family into regent-president of the Kingdom of Hungary. As the influential contemporary American journalist Horace Greeley said of Kossuth: &quot;Among the orators, patriots, statesmen, exiles, he has, living or dead, no superior.&quot;

Kossuth&#x27;s powerful English and American speeches so impressed and touched the famous contemporary American orator Daniel Webster, that he wrote a book about Kossuth&#x27;s life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster/1851/Kossuth&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was widely honoured during his lifetime, including in Great Britain and the United States, as a freedom fighter and bellwether of democracy in Europe. Kossuth&#x27;s bronze bust can be found in the United States Capitol with the inscription: &quot;Father of Hungarian Democracy, Hungarian Statesman, Freedom Fighter, 1848–1849&quot;. Friedrich Engels considered him to be &quot;a truly revolutionary figure, a man who in the name of his people dares to accept the challenge of a desperate struggle, who for his nation is Danton and Carnot in one person...&quot;.

==Early years==

Lajos Kossuth was born into an untitled lower noble (gentry) family in Monok, Kingdom of Hungary, a small town in the county of Zemplén in modern-day Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County of Northern Hungary. He was the eldest of five children in a Lutheran noble family of Slovak origin. His father, László Kossuth (1762–1839), belonged to the lower nobility, had a small estate and was a lawyer by profession. László had two brothers (Simon Kossuth and György Kossuth) and one sister (Jana).

The family moved from Monok to Olaszliszka in 1803, and then to Sátoraljaújhely in 1808. Lajos had four younger sisters.

Lajos&#x27; mother, Karolina, raised her children as strict Lutherans. As a result of their mixed ancestry, and as was quite common during his era, her children spoke three languages – Hungarian, German and Slovak – even in their early childhood.

Lajos studied at the Piarist college of Sátoraljaújhely and the Calvinist college of Sárospatak (for one year) and the University of Pest (now Budapest). At nineteen he entered his father&#x27;s legal practice. Between 1824 and 1832 he practiced law in his native Zemplén County. His career quickly took off, thanks also to his father, who was a lawyer for several higher aristocratic families, and thus involved his son in the administration, and his son soon took over some of his father&#x27;s work. He first became a lawyer in the Lutheran parish of Sátoraljaújhely, in 1827 he became a judge, and later he became a prosecutor in Sátoraljaújhely. During this time, in addition to his office work, he made historical chronologies and translations. In the national census of 1828, in which taxpayers were counted in order to eliminate tax disparities, Kossuth assisted in the organization of the census of Zemplén county. He was popular locally, and having been appointed steward to the countess Szapáry, a widow with large estates, he became her voting representative in the county assembly and settled in Pest. He was subsequently dismissed on the grounds of some misunderstanding in regards to estate funds.

==Ancestry==


The House of Kossuth, into which Lajos was born, originated from the county of Turóc (now partially Turiec region, Košúty, north-central Slovakia). They acquired the rank of nobility in 1263 from King Béla IV. The Kossuths married into the Zathureczky, Nedeczky, Borcsány, and Prónay families, amongst others. Lajos Kossuth&#x27;s paternal grandmother was a Beniczky and her Beniczky ancestors had married into the following families: Farkas, Zmeskal (one-eight Polish ancestry); Révay, Pajor (one-quarter German Baierle Magyarized to Pajor); and finally, Prónay. Lajos Kossuth&#x27;s mother, Karolina Weber (1770–1853), was born to a Lutheran family (Kaltensteìn-Hidegkövy) of three-quarters-German and Magyarized-German (with one-quarter of their descent unknown), living in Upper Hungary (today partially Slovakia).

===Family-tree===

==Entry into national politics==
Shortly after his dismissal by Countess Szapáry, Kossuth was appointed as deputy to Count Hunyady at the Diet of Hungary. The Diet met during 1825–27 and 1832–36 in Pressburg (Pozsony, present Bratislava), then capital of Hungary.

Only the upper aristocracy could vote in the House of Magnates (similar to the British House of Lords) and Kossuth took little part in the debates as a deputy of Count Hunyady. At the time, a struggle to reassert a Hungarian national identity was beginning to emerge under leaders such as Miklós Wesselényi and the Széchenyis. In part, it was also a struggle for fundamental economic and political and societal reforms against the stagnant and conservative Austrian government. Kossuth&#x27;s duties to Count Hunyady included reporting on Diet proceedings in writing, as the Austrian government, fearing popular dissent, had banned published reports.

The high quality of Kossuth&#x27;s letters led to their being circulated in manuscript among other liberal magnates. Readership demands led him to edit an organized parliamentary gazette (&quot;Országgyűlési tudósítások&quot;); spreading his name and influence further. Orders from the Official Censor halted circulation by lithograph printing. Distribution in manuscript by post was forbidden by the government, although circulation by hand continued.

In 1836, the Diet was dissolved. Kossuth continued to report (in letter form), covering the debates of the county assemblies. The newfound publicity gave the assemblies national political prominence. Previously, they had had little idea of each other&#x27;s proceedings. His embellishment of the speeches from the liberals and reformers enhanced the impact of his newsletters. After the prohibition of his parliamentary gazette, Kossuth loudly demanded the legal declaration of freedom of the press and of speech in Hungary and in the entire Habsburg Empire. The government attempted in vain to suppress the letters, and, other means having failed, he was arrested in May 1837, with Wesselényi and several others, on a charge of high treason.

After spending a year in prison at Buda awaiting trial, he was condemned to four more years&#x27; imprisonment. Kossuth and his friend Count Miklós Wesselényi were placed in separated solitary cells. Count Wesselényi&#x27;s cell did not have even a window, and he went blind in the darkness. Kossuth, however, had a small window and with the help of a politically well-informed young woman, Theresa Meszlényi, he remained informed about political events. Meszlényi lied to the prison commander, telling him she and Kossuth were engaged. In reality, Kossuth did not know Meszlényi before his imprisonment, but this permitted her to visit. Meszlényi also provided books. Strict confinement damaged Kossuth&#x27;s health, but he spent much time reading. He greatly increased his political knowledge and acquired fluency in English from study of the King James Version of the Bible and William Shakespeare which he henceforth always spoke with a certain archaic eloquence. While Wesselényi was broken mentally, Kossuth, supported by Terézia Meszlényi&#x27;s frequent visits, emerged from prison in much better condition. His arrest had caused great controversy. The Diet, which reconvened in 1839, demanded the release of the political prisoners and refused to pass any government measures. Austrian chancellor Metternich long remained obdurate, but the danger of war in 1840 obliged him to give way.

===Marriage and children===

On the day of his release from the prison, Kossuth and Meszlényi were married, and she remained a firm supporter of his politics. She was a Catholic and her Church refused to bless the marriage since Kossuth, a proud Protestant, would not convert. At the time of their marriage it was unheard of that people of different religions married. According to the traditional practice, the bride or more rarely the fiancé had to convert to the religion of his or her spouse before the wedding ceremony. However Kossuth refused to convert to Roman Catholicism, and Meszlényi also refused to convert to Lutheranism. Their mixed religious marriage caused a great scandal at the time. This experience influenced Kossuth&#x27;s firm defense of mixed marriages. The couple had three children: Ferenc Lajos Ákos (1841–1914), Minister for Trade between 1906 and 1910; Vilma (1843–1862); and Lajos Tódor Károly (1844–1918).

==Journalist and political leader==

Kossuth had now become a national icon. He regained full health in January 1841. In January 1841 he became editor of the Pesti Hírlap. The job was offered to him by Lajos Landerer, the owner of a big printing house company in Pest (in fact, Landerer was an undercover agent of the Vienna secret police). 
The government circles and the secret police believed that censorship and financial interests would curtail Kossuth&#x27;s opposition, and they did not consider the small circulation of the paper to be dangerous anyway. However, Kossuth created modern Hungarian political journalism. His editorials dealt with the pressing problems of the economy, the social injustices and the existing legal inequality of the common people. The articles combined a critique of the present with an outline of the future, combining and supplementing the reform ideas that had emerged up to that point into a coherent programme.
The paper achieved unprecedented success, soon reaching the then immense circulation of 7000 copies. A competing pro-government newspaper, &quot;Világ&quot;(World), started up, but despite its attacks against Kossuth&#x27;s ideas, it became counterproductive, and it only served to increase Kossuth&#x27;s visibility and add to the general political fervor.

Kossuth&#x27;s ideas stand on the enlightened Western European type liberal nationalism (based on the &quot;jus soli&quot; principle, that is the complete opposition of the typical Eastern European ethnic nationalism, which based on &quot;jus sanguinis&quot;).

Kossuth followed the ideas of the French nation state ideology, which was a ruling liberal idea of his era. Accordingly, he considered and regarded automatically everybody as &quot;Hungarian&quot; – regardless of their mother tongue and ethnic ancestry – who were born and lived in the territory of Hungary. He even quoted King Stephen I of Hungary&#x27;s admonition: &quot;A nation of one language and the same customs is weak and fragile.&quot;

Kossuth pleaded in the newspaper &quot;Pesti Hírlap&quot; for rapid Magyarization: &quot;Let us hurry, let us hurry to Magyarize the Croats, the Romanians, and the Saxons, for otherwise we shall perish&quot;. In 1842 he argued that Hungarian had to be the exclusive language in public life. He also stated that &quot;in one country it is impossible to speak in a hundred different languages. There must be one language and in Hungary this must be Hungarian&quot;.

Kossuth&#x27;s assimilatory ambitions were disapproved by Zsigmond Kemény, though he supported a multinational state led by Hungarians. István Széchenyi criticized Kossuth for &quot;pitting one nationality against another&quot;. He publicly warned Kossuth that his appeals to the passions of the people would lead the nation to revolution. Kossuth, undaunted, did not stop at the publicly reasoned reforms demanded by all Liberals: the abolition of entail, the abolition of feudal burdens and taxation of the nobles. He went on to broach the possibility of separating from the House of Habsburg. By combining this nationalism with an insistence on the superiority of the Hungarian culture to the culture of Slavonic inhabitants of Hungary, he sowed the seeds of both the collapse of Hungary in 1849 and his own political demise.

In 1844, Kossuth was dismissed from &quot;Pesti Hírlap&quot; after a dispute with the proprietor over salary. It is believed that the dispute was rooted in government intrigue. Kossuth was unable to obtain permission to start his own newspaper. In a personal interview, Metternich offered to take him into the government service. Kossuth refused and spent the next three years without a regular position. He continued to agitate on behalf of both political and commercial independence for Hungary. He adopted the economic principles of Friedrich List, and was the founder of the popular whose members consumed only Hungarian industrial products. He also argued for the creation of a Hungarian port at Fiume.

Kossuth played a major role in the formation of the Opposition Party in 1847, whose programme was essentially formulated by him.

In autumn 1847, Kossuth was able to take his final key step. The support of Lajos Batthyány during a keenly fought campaign made him be elected to the new Diet as member for Pest. He proclaimed: &quot;Now that I am a deputy, I will cease to be an agitator.&quot; He immediately became chief leader of the Opposition Party. Ferenc Deák was absent. As Headlam noted, his political rivals, Batthyány, István Széchenyi, Szemere, and József Eötvös, believed:

===The &quot;long debate&quot; of reformers in the press===

Count Széchenyi judged the reform system of Kossuth in a pamphlet, &quot;Kelet Népe&quot; from 1841. According to Széchenyi, economic, political and social reforms must be instituted slowly and carefully so that Hungary would avoid the violent interference of the Habsburg dynasty. Széchenyi was listening to the spread of the expansion of Kossuth&#x27;s ideas in Hungarian society, which did not consider good relations with the Habsburg dynasty. Kossuth believed that society could not be forced into a passive role by any reason through social change. According to Kossuth, the wider social movements can not be continually excluded from political life. Behind Kossuth&#x27;s conception of society was a notion of freedom that emphasized the unitary origin of rights, which he saw manifested in universal suffrage. In exercising political rights, Széchenyi took into account wealth and education of the citizens, thus he supported only limited suffrage similar to the Western European (British, French and Belgian) limited suffrage of the era. In 1885, Kossuth called Széchenyi a liberal elitist aristocrat while Széchenyi considered himself to be a democrat.

Széchenyi was an isolationist politician while, according to Kossuth, strong relations and collaboration with international liberal and progressive movements are essential for the success of liberty. Regarding foreign policy, Kossuth and his followers refused the isolationist policy of Széchenyi, thus they stood on the ground of the liberal internationalism: They supported countries and political forces that aligned with their moral and political standards. They also believed that governments and political movements sharing the same modern liberal values should form an alliance against the &quot;feudal type&quot; of monarchies.

Széchenyi&#x27;s economic policy based on Anglo-Saxon free-market principles, while Kossuth supported the protective tariffs due to the weaker Hungarian industrial sector. Kossuth wanted to build a rapidly industrialized country in his vision while Széchenyi wanted to preserve the traditionally strong agricultural sector as the main character of the economy.

==Work in the government==

===Minister of Finance===

The crisis came, and he used it to the full. On 3 March 1848, shortly after the news of the revolution in Paris had arrived, in a speech of surpassing power he demanded parliamentary government for Hungary and constitutional government for the rest of Austria.

He appealed to the hope of the Habsburgs, &quot;our beloved Archduke Franz Joseph&quot; (then seventeen years old), to perpetuate the ancient glory of the dynasty by meeting half-way the aspirations of a free people. He at once became the leader of the European revolution; his speech was read aloud in the streets of Vienna to the mob which overthrew Metternich (13 March); when a deputation from the Diet visited Vienna to receive the assent of Emperor Ferdinand to their petition, Kossuth received the chief ovation. While Viennese masses celebrated Kossuth (and from the Diet in Pressburg a delegation went to Buda and sent the news of the Austrian Revolution) as their hero, revolution broke out in Buda on 15 March; Kossuth traveled home immediately. On 17 March 1848 the Emperor assented and Lajos Batthyány created the first Hungarian government, that was not anymore responsible to the King, but to the elected members of the Diet. On 23 March 1848, Pm. Batthyány commended his government to the Diet. In the new government Kossuth was appointed as the Minister of Finance.

He began developing the internal resources of the country: re-establishing a separate Hungarian coinage, and using every means to increase national self-consciousness. Characteristically, the new Hungarian bank notes had Kossuth&#x27;s name as the most prominent inscription; making reference to &quot;Kossuth Notes&quot; a future byword.

A new paper was started, to which was given the name of &quot;Kossuth Hirlapja&quot;, so that from the first it was Kossuth rather than the Palatine or prime minister Batthyány whose name was in the minds of the people associated with the new government. Much more was this the case when, in the summer, the dangers from the Croats, Serbs and the reaction at Vienna increased.

In a speech on 11 July he asked that the nation should arm in self-defense, and demanded 200,000 men; amid a scene of wild enthusiasm this was granted by acclamation. However the danger had been exacerbated by Kossuth himself through appealing exclusively to the Magyar notables rather than including the other subject minorities of the Habsburg empire too. The Austrians, meanwhile, successfully used the other minorities as allies against the Magyar uprising.

While Croatian ban Josip Jelačić was marching on Pest, the Hungarian government was in serious military crisis due to the lack of soldiers, Kossuth used his popularity, he went from town to town rousing the people to the defense of the country, and the popular force of the Honvéd was his creation. When Batthyány resigned he was appointed with Szemere to carry on the government provisionally, and at the end of September he was made President of the Committee of National Defense.
Prime minister Lajos Batthyány&#x27;s desperate attempts to mediate with the Viennese royal court to achieve reconciliation and restore peace were no longer successful. Due to his unsuccessful peace missions, Batthyány slowly began to become politically isolated and increasingly lost the support of the parliament.

On 6 September, Kossuth ordered the first Hungarian banknotes to be issued to cover defence expenses.

In early September 1848, after the Habsburg King of Hungary, Ferdinand V, compelled the Batthyány government to resign, the nation found itself once more bereft of executive authority.

The government meeting of 11 September, under Kossuth&#x27;s leadership, adopted revolutionary decisions on finance and the military to defend the invaded homeland. Another attempt by Batthyány to form a cabinet failed, and Kossuth declared that until another government was appointed, he would retain his position as finance minister.

According to legend, it was in this year that Kossuth was attacked by the country&#x27;s most famous betyár, Sándor Rózsa. According to the story, Kossuth was on his way to Cegléd in a horse-drawn carriage when the bandit leader attacked him, but he kept his temper and persuaded him to join the national cause and stop robbing. The story might even be true, as Kossuth granted amnesty to the criminal on 23 October, who inturn launched an independent rebel group with 150 armed horsemen. Both men inspired legends in their time that are still alive today. In popular poetry, Rózsa is seen as a Robin Hood-like character, while Kossuth was the personification of the nation. Also, the Serbs referred to him as King Kossuth, whose carriage was said to be drawn by 600 horses.

===Regent-President of Hungary===

On 7 December 1848, the Diet of Hungary formally refused to acknowledge the title of the new king, Franz Joseph I, &quot;as without the knowledge and consent of the diet no one could sit on the Hungarian throne&quot; and called the nation to arms. From a legal point of view, according to the coronation oath, a crowned Hungarian King could not relinquish the Hungarian throne during his life; if the king was alive and unable to do his duty as ruler, a governor (or regent with proper English terminology) had to deputize the royal duties. Constitutionally, his uncle, Ferdinand remained still the legal King of Hungary. If there was no possibility to inherit the throne automatically due to the death of the predecessor king (as Ferdinand was still alive), but the monarch wanted to relinquish his throne and appoint another king before his death, technically only one legal solution remained: the Diet had the power to depose the king and elect his successor as the new King of Hungary. Due to the legal and military tensions, the Hungarian parliament did not make that decision for Franz Joseph.
This event gave to the revolt an excuse of legality. Actually, from this time until the collapse of the revolution, Lajos Kossuth (as elected regent-president) became the de facto and de jure ruler of Hungary.

====President of the OHB====
Subsequent to 28 September, the National Defence Committee (Országos Honvédelmi Bizottmány, or OHB) assumed the reins of power, initially in a provisional capacity and then, upon a parliamentary decree issued on 8 October, in a permanent manner for wartime. Lajos Kossuth was elected president of the OHB, which operated as the de facto government.

Already on 14 September, a rapidly growing number of his supporters called in parliament for Kossuth to be given temporary dictatorial powers because of the critical and desperate war situation.

From this time he had increased amounts of power. The direction of the whole government was in his hands. Without military experience, he had to control and direct the movements of armies; he was unable to keep control over the generals or to establish that military co-operation so essential to success. Arthur Görgey in particular, whose great abilities Kossuth was the first to recognize, refused obedience; the two men were very different personalities. Twice Kossuth removed him from command; twice he had to restore him.

==== Declaration of Independence ====

====Minority rights====

Despite appealing exclusively to the Hungarian nobility in his speeches, Kossuth played an important part in the shaping of the law of minority rights in 1849. It was the first law which recognized minority rights in Europe. It gave minorities the freedom to use their mother tongue within the local administration and courts, in schools, in community life and even within the national guard of non-Magyar councils.

However, he did not support any kind of regional administration within Hungary based on the nationality principle. Kossuth accepted some national demands of the Vlach (like the independence of the Vlach clergy) and the Croats, but he showed no understanding for the requests of the Slovaks. Despite his father&#x27;s Slovak origin and the fact that his uncle György Kossuth was the main supporter of Slovak national movement, Kossuth considered himself Hungarian and went so far as to reject the very notion of a Slovak nation in the Kingdom of Hungary.
According to Oszkár Jászi, a huge part of the reason as to why Kossuth opposed giving large-scale autonomy (such as a separate parliament) to various ethnic groups in Hungary (such as the Romanians, Slovaks, Ruthenians, and Germans) is because he was afraid that this would be the first step towards a fragmentation and break-up of Hungary. Kossuth did not believe that a Hungary that was limited to its ethnic or linguistic borders would actually be a viable state.

====Russian intervention and failure====

During all the terrible winter that followed, Kossuth overcame the reluctance of the army to march to the relief of Vienna; after the defeat at the Battle of Schwechat, at which he was present, he sent Józef Bem to carry on the war in Transylvania.

At the end of the year, when the Austrians were approaching Pest, he asked for the mediation of William Henry Stiles, the American envoy. Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, however, refused all terms, and the Diet and government fled to Debrecen, Kossuth taking with him the Crown of St Stephen, the sacred emblem of the Hungarian nation. In November 1848, Emperor Ferdinand abdicated in favour of Franz Joseph. The new Emperor revoked all the concessions granted in March and outlawed Kossuth and the Hungarian government, set up lawfully on the basis of the April laws.

By April 1849, when the Hungarians had won many successes, after sounding the army, he issued the celebrated Hungarian Declaration of Independence, in which he declared that &quot;the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, perjured in the sight of God and man, had forfeited the Hungarian throne.&quot; It was a step characteristic of his love for extreme and dramatic action, but it added to the dissensions between him and those who wished only for autonomy under the old dynasty, and his enemies did not scruple to accuse him of aiming for kingship. The dethronement also made any compromise with the Habsburgs practically impossible.

For the time the future form of government was left undecided, and Kossuth was appointed regent-president (to satisfy both royalists and republicans). Kossuth played a key role in tying down the Hungarian army for weeks for the siege and recapture of Buda castle, finally successful on 4 May 1849. The hopes of ultimate success were, however, frustrated by the intervention of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, who acted as the protector of ruling legitimism and as guardian against revolution; all appeals to the western powers were vain, and on 11 August Kossuth abdicated in favor of Görgey, on the ground that in the last extremity, the general alone could save the nation. Görgey capitulated at Világos (now Şiria, Romania) to the Russians, who handed over the army to the Austrians. Görgey was spared, at the insistence of the Russians. Reprisals were taken on the rest of the Hungarian army, including the execution of the 13 Martyrs of Arad. Kossuth steadfastly maintained until his death that Görgey alone was responsible for the humiliation.

Kossuth&#x27;s calls for independence and cut off ties with the Habsburgs did not become British policy. Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston told parliament that Britain would consider it a great misfortune to Europe if Hungary became independent. He argued that a united Austrian Empire was a European necessity and a natural ally of Britain.

During this period, Hungarian lawyer George Lichtenstein served as Kossuth&#x27;s private secretary. After the revolution, Lichtenstein fled to Königsberg and eventually settled in Edinburgh, where he became noted as a musician and influence on musical culture of the city.

==Escape and tour of Britain and United States==

Kossuth&#x27;s time in power was at an end. A solitary fugitive, he crossed the Ottoman frontier. He was hospitably received by the Ottoman authorities, who were supported by the British. The Ottomans refused to surrender him and other fugitives to Austria, notwithstanding the threats of the allied emperors. In January 1850, he was removed from Vidin, where he had been kept under house arrest, to Shumen, and thence to Kütahya in Asia Minor. There, he was joined by his children, who had been confined at Pressburg; his wife (a price had been set on her head) had joined him earlier, having escaped in disguise.

On 10 August 1851 the release of Kossuth was decided by the Sublime Porte, in spite of threats by Austria and Russia. The United States Congress approved having Kossuth come there, and on 1 September 1851, he boarded the ship USS &quot;Mississippi&quot; at Smyrna, with his family and fifty exiled followers.

The Hungarian asked the crew of &quot;Mississippi&quot; to leave the shipboard at Gibraltar. During his journey on board the American frigate Mississippi on his way to London, an enormous French crowd waited to welcome Kossuth at the port of Marseille. However the French authorities did not allow the dangerous revolutionary to come ashore. At Marseille, Kossuth sought permission to travel through France to England, but Prince-President Louis Napoleon denied the request. Kossuth protested publicly, and officials saw that as a blatant disregard for the neutral position of the United States.

===Great Britain===


On 23 October, Kossuth landed at Southampton and spent three weeks in England, where he was generally feted. After his arrival, the press characterized the atmosphere of the streets of London as this: &quot;It had seemed like a coronation day of Kings&quot;. Contemporary reports noticed: &quot;Trafalgar Square was &#x27;black with people&#x27; and Nelson&#x27;s Monument peopled &#x27;up to the fluted shaft.&#x27;&quot;

Addresses were presented to him at Southampton, Birmingham and other towns; he was officially entertained by the Lord Mayor of the City of London; at each place, he spoke eloquently in English for the Hungarian cause; and he indirectly caused Queen Victoria to stretch the limits of her constitutional power over her Ministers to avoid embarrassment and eventually helped cause the fall of the government in power.

Having learned English during an earlier political imprisonment with the aid of a volume of Shakespeare, his spoken English was &quot;wonderfully archaic&quot; and theatrical. &quot;The Times&quot;, generally cool towards the revolutionaries of 1848 in general and Kossuth in particular, nevertheless reported that his speeches were &quot;clear&quot; and that a three-hour talk was not unusual for him; and also, that if he was occasionally overcome by emotion when describing the defeat of Hungarian aspirations, &quot;it did not at all reduce his effectiveness&quot;.

At Southampton, he was greeted by a crowd of thousands outside the Mayor&#x27;s balcony, who presented him with a flag of the Hungarian Republic. The City of London Corporation accompanied him in procession through the city, and the way to the Guildhall was lined by thousands of cheering people. He went thereafter to Winchester, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham; at Birmingham the crowd that gathered to see him ride under the triumphal arches erected for his visit was described, even by his severest critics, as 75,000 individuals.

Many leading British politicians tried to suppress the so-called &quot;Kossuth mania&quot; in Britain without any success, the Kossuth mania proved to be unstoppable. When &quot;The Times&quot; tried to fiercely attack Kossuth, the copies of the newspaper were publicly burned in public houses, coffee houses, and in other public spaces throughout the country.

Back in London, he addressed the Trades Unions at Copenhagen Fields in Islington. Some twelve thousand &quot;respectable artisans&quot; formed a parade at Russell Square and marched out to meet him. At the Fields themselves, the crowd was enormous; but the hostile newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; estimated it conservatively at 25,000, while the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; described it as 50,000, and the demonstrators themselves 100,000.

The Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, who had already proved himself a friend of the losing sides in several of the failed revolutions of 1848, was determined to receive him at his country house, Broadlands. The Cabinet had to vote to prevent it; Victoria reputedly was so incensed by the possibility of her Foreign Secretary supporting an outspoken republican that she asked the Prime Minister, Lord John Russell for Palmerston&#x27;s resignation, but Russell claimed that such a dismissal would be drastically unpopular at that time and over that issue. When Palmerston upped the ante by receiving at his house, instead of Kossuth, a delegation of Trade Unionists from Islington and Finsbury and listened sympathetically as they read an address that praised Kossuth and declared the Emperors of Austria and Russia &quot;despots, tyrants and odious assassins&quot;, it was noted as a mark of indifference to royal displeasure. That, together with Palmerston&#x27;s support of Louis Napoleon, eventually caused the Russell government to fall.

Due to Kossuth activity, the anti-Austrian sentiment became strong in Britain, when Austrian general Julius Jacob von Haynau was recognized on the street, he was attacked by British draymen on his journey in England. In 1856, Kossuth toured Scotland extensively, giving lectures in major cities and small towns alike.

In addition, the indignation that he aroused against Russian policy had much to do with the strong anti-Russian feeling, which made the Crimean War possible. During the Crimean War, the activism of Kossuth also intensified in London, but since Austria did not side with Russia, there was no chance of Hungarian independence being achieved with Anglo-French military help. In the following years, Kossuth hoped that the conflicts between the great powers would allow the liberation of Hungary after all, and so he contacted the French Emperor Napoleon III. When Napoleon III and the Prime Minister of Sardinia, Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, promised to help liberate Hungary in the run-up to the Franco-Sardinian-Austrian war of 1859, Lajos Kossuth founded the Hungarian National Directorate with László Teleki and György Klapka and began to organise the Hungarian Legion. Following Napoleon III&#x27;s unexpected peace with Austria after his brilliant victory at Solferino, Kossuth sought to link the liberation of Hungary more and more clearly to the movement of the peoples fighting for their independence. However, Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s invasion of Sicily in 1860 raised new hopes. Many Hungarians fought among his Redshirts, and his successes could have led to another Italo-Austrian war. In the event, the Hungarian Legion was re-established, and Kossuth negotiated cooperation with the Italians. But the war was not fought. Although Hungary remained under Austrian rule, the decline of Habsburg power increasingly forced compromise on the Austrian government. Hungarian passive resistance and the foreign activities of the Kossuth group reinforced each other. Kossuth and the émigré movement&#x27;s armed preparations and negotiations with the great powers, on the other hand, were backed by the political backdrop of a silent and passively resistant country.

===United States===

From Britain Kossuth went to the United States of America aboard the Humboldt postal vessel. He was warmly welcomed since the Congress in a letter inviting him to the country as the &#x27;guest of the nation&#x27;. On 6 December 1851, this revolutionary hero arrived in New York City to a reception that only Washington and Lafayette had received before. The mayor of New York City introduced him as &quot;a champion of human progress, an eloquent proclaimer of universal freedom&quot;. On the posters and in the news, he appeared as an ambassador of the European nations yearning for freedom and democracy, an implacable opponent of the tyranny embodied by the Habsburgs and the Russian Romanovs. Like the more than 600 other speeches he has given in America, it as well ended with applause.

The report of &quot;The Sun&quot; about the arrival of Kossuth in New York:

President Millard Fillmore entertained Kossuth at the White House on 31 December 1851 and 3 January 1852. The US Congress organized a banquet for Kossuth, which was supported by all political parties.

In early 1852, Kossuth, accompanied by his wife, his son Ferenc, and Theresa Pulszky, toured the American Midwest, South, and New England. Kossuth was the second foreigner after the Marquis de Lafayette to address a Joint Meeting of the United States Congress. He gave a speech before the Ohio General Assembly in February 1852 that probably influenced Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address: &quot;The spirit of our age is Democracy. All for the people, and all by the people. Nothing about the people without the peopleThat is Democracy!...&quot;

Kossuth&#x27;s cult spread far and wide across the continent. Even babies were named after him during his American tour. At the same time, dozens of books, hundreds of pamphlets, articles, and essays, as well as about 250 poems were written to, for, or about him in the 1850s.

Queen Victoria had a negative remark about the American version of Kossuth fever too:
&quot;the popular Kossuth fever of the time to ignorance of the man in whom they (the Americans) see a second Washington, when the fact is that he is an ambitious and rapacious humbug.&quot;

There is no evidence that Kossuth ever met Abraham Lincoln, although Lincoln did organize a celebration in Kossuth&#x27;s honor in Springfield, Illinois, calling him a &quot;most worthy and distinguished representative of the cause of civil and religious liberty on the continent of Europe&quot;. Kossuth believed that by appealing directly to European immigrants in the American heartland that he could rally them behind the cause of a free and democratic Hungary. United States officials feared that Kossuth&#x27;s efforts to elicit support for a failed revolution were fraught with mischief. He would not denounce slavery or stand up for the Catholic Church, and when Kossuth declared George Washington had never intended for the policy of non-interference to serve as constitutional dogma, he caused further defection. Luckily for him, it was unknown then that he entertained a proposal to raise 1,500 mercenaries, who would overthrow Haiti with officers from the US Army and Navy. Ralph Waldo Emerson praised Kossuth: &quot;You have earned your own nobility at home. We admit you ad eundem (as they say at College). We admit you to the same degree, without new trial. We suspend all rules before so paramount a merit. You may well sit a doctor in the college of liberty. You have achieved your right to interpret our Washington.&quot;

However, the issue of slavery was tearing America apart. Kossuth infuriated the abolitionists by refusing to say anything offensive to the pro-slavery establishment, which, however, did not give him much support. Abolitionists said that Kossuth&#x27;s &quot;hands off&quot; position regarding American slavery was unacceptable. Wm. Lloyd Garrison, on behalf of the American Anti-Slavery Society, published a pamphlet &quot;exposing the Hungarian as a self-seeking toady.&quot; Kossuth left the U.S. with only a fraction of the money he had hoped to earn on his tour. However it is proven by captain of the artillery Károly László&#x27;s contemporary diary entries, that the Hungarian delegation was disgusted by the treatment of the slaves. He also condemned blackface in his entries. He describes a slave auction he saw in New Orleans this way: &quot;Here we have seen how the owners put their fellow human beings who are just as advanced and perhaps more sensitive than they are, up for sale as if they were animals, and how they are scrutinised by buyers. We have seen how [a trader] sold a mother and her 10-year-old son as a calving cow... Seeing such things makes you feel sick.&quot; Kossuth was of the same opinion, as he expressed his ideas on the matter on several Hungarian diets. In 1833 he compares slavery to serfdom and condemns both, on another occasion, expressed the need for the immediate liberation of the serfs, which just as emancipation, must be radical. In 1834 he declares that abolition is the most glorious act, nobler than any victory in battle. In America, he is afraid to do such a thing, because he feared that there would be fewer like-minded people in America, having seen the South. This would be proven wrong 13 years later by the Civil War.

Kossuth ruined all chances for backing when he openly recommended to German Americans they should choose Franklin Pierce for president. The gaffe brought him back to London in July 1852.

Early the next year, he sent Ferenc Pulszky to meet with Pierce to obtain support for intervention in Europe. Pulszky was to also meet in secret with Lt. William Nelson USN and make plans for an expedition against Haiti and Santo Domingo. The plot ended with the failure of the Milanese riots of 1853, and Kossuth made no further efforts to win backing from the United States.

==London==

===Attempted leadership in exile===
After returning from America to Europe, he lived permanently in London for eight years, where he gained many important connections in British parliamentary, writer and journalistic circles. He also liaised with circles of French, Italian, Russian, German, and Polish emigrants, most notably Giuseppe Mazzini and Stanisław Gabriel Worcell, who were influential in organizing unsubstantiated uprising attempts in the early 1850s. In the following years, Kossuth expected that the conflicts between the great powers would still make it possible to liberate Hungary, and therefore he had even several personal talks with Emperor Napoleon III in Paris.

He made a close connection with his friend Giuseppe Mazzini, by whom, with some misgiving, he was persuaded to join the Revolutionary Committee. Quarrels of a kind only too common among exiles followed.

He watched with anxiety every opportunity of once more freeing his country from Austria. An attempt to organize a Hungarian legion during the Crimean War was stopped; but in 1859, he entered into negotiations with Napoleon III, left England for Italy and began the organization of a Hungarian legion, which was to make a descent on the coast of Dalmatia. The Peace of Villafranca made that impossible. There were still significant international forces supporting the Habsburgs to maintain their empire, because Austria was seen as an important element in the balance of great powers.

Gradually, his autocratic style and uncompromising outlook destroyed any real influence among the Hungarian expatriate community. Other Hungarian exiles protested against his appearing to claim to be the only national hero of the revolution. Count Kázmér Batthyány attacked him in &quot;The Times&quot;, and Bertalan Szemere, who had been prime minister under him, published a bitter criticism of his acts and character, accusing him of arrogance, cowardice and duplicity. Hungarians were especially offended by his continuing use of the title of Regent. Kossuth considered the use of his regent title constitutionally justified until the next democratic elections in Hungary. Accordingly, he used his title until the 1869 Hungarian parliamentary election.

==Later years: Italy==

=== Embittered break with Hungarian patriots ===
There were still significant international forces supporting the Habsburgs to maintain their empire, because Austria was seen as an important element in the continental balance of power. However, Garibaldi&#x27;s invasion of Sicily in 1860 raised new hopes for Kossuth. Many Hungarian 1848 veterans fought among the Italian soldiers, and the Italian successes could have led to another Italian-Austrian war. To this end, the Hungarian Legion was re-established, and Kossuth negotiated cooperation with the Italians.
However the promise of the international conference never took root. In 1861, Kossuth moved to Turin, Italy, had to watch Ferenc Deák guide Hungary toward a compromise with the Austrian monarchy. He did so with a bitter heart, and on the day before the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (German: &quot;Ausgleich&quot;, Hungarian: &quot;Kiegyezés&quot;), he published an open letter condemning it and Deák. This so-called &quot;Cassandra letter&quot; rallied the opponents of the Compromise, but they could not prevent its adoption and subsequent continuation. Kossuth blamed Deák for giving up the nation&#x27;s right of true independence and asserted that the conditions he had accepted went against the interests of the state&#x27;s very existence. In the letter, his vision predicted that Hungary, having bound its fate to that of the Austrian German nation and the Habsburgs, would go down with them. He adumbrated a subsequent devastating European-scale war on the Continent, which would be fueled and induced by extremist nationalism, with Hungary on the side of a &quot;dying empire&quot;.

&quot;I see in the Compromise the death of our nation,&quot; he wrote.

From then on, Kossuth remained in Italy. He refused to follow the other Hungarian patriots, who, under the lead of Deák, negotiated the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the ensuing amnesty. It is doubted whether Emperor Franz Joseph would have allowed the amnesty to extend to Kossuth.

In 1874 Kossuth bought a villa in the village of Collegno with a large garden in a small hamlet called Baraccone not far from the train station, and spent his days with gardening, botanical expeditions to the Alps, writing his memoirs and receiving Hungarian guests. He was forced to sell the villa in 1882 due to financial difficulties plaguing him since he lost most of his wealth in the aftermath of the 1873 financial crisis. Reluctantly he moved back to the city of Turin.

Facing financial hardships, he struggled in his later years. However, encouraged by Ignác Helfy, he started compiling his life memories in 1879, focusing particularly on documents related to emigration history. Additionally, he allowed British, American, French, and Italian publishers to print his renowned speeches and political debates. The remarkable success of his books swiftly reinstated his financial stability and wealth, and throughout his later years, he took pride in the knowledge that he was still making a living through his work.

In 1890, a delegation of Hungarian pilgrims in Turin recorded a short patriotic speech delivered by the elderly Lajos Kossuth. The original recording on two wax cylinders for the Edison phonograph survives to this day, barely audible because of excess playback and unsuccessful early restoration attempts. Recording Kossuth&#x27;s voice was one of the earliest applications of phonograph, and his few sentences are the earliest known recorded Hungarian speech. Until the discovery of a recording of Helmuth von Moltke in 2012, Lajos Kossuth was the person with the earliest birth date from whom a sound recording was known.

===European federalism===


Publicly, Kossuth remained unreconciled to the house of Habsburg and committed to a fully independent state. He expressed the idea of uniting with the Hungarian and neighbouring peoples in his plans for the future, which also contained many utopian elements, and in his equally utopian plan for the future confederation of the already liberated peoples under the name of Republics of Danubian Confederation. Though elected to the Diet of 1869, he never took his seat. 
===The &quot;Kossuth party&quot; in the Hungarian parliament===

The Party of Independence and &#x27;48 was established in 1884 by a merger of the Independence Party and the Party of 1848. Although Kossuth had never returned to Hungary, he was the spiritual leader of this opposition party until he died in 1894, and the party was also referred to as the &quot;Kossuth Party&quot; thereafter. From the 1896 elections onwards, it was the main opposition to the ruling Liberal Party. The Kossuth party won the 1905, and 1906 elections, his older son Ferenc Kossuth was Minister for Trade between 1906 and 1910. However it lost the 1910 elections to the National Party of Work.
Kossuth&#x27;s political legacy achieved that ethnic Hungarians did not vote for the ruling pro-compromise Liberal Party in the Hungarian parliamentary elections, thus the political maintenance of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise was mostly a result of the popularity of the pro-compromise Liberal Party among the ethnic minorities.

==Death, legacy, complete works==
As Headlam noted, Kossuth died in Turin, after which &quot;his body was taken to Pest (Budapest), where he was buried amid the mourning of the whole nation, Mór Jókai delivering the funeral oration&quot;; furthermore, a &quot;bronze statue (was) erected by public subscription, in the Kerepesi Cemetery...&quot; which commemorates Kossuth as &quot;Hungary&#x27;s purest patriot and greatest orator.&quot;

A Hungarian language version of his complete works were published in Budapest between 1880 and 1895.
==Honors and memorials==
===In Hungary===

The main square of Budapest with the Hungarian Parliament Building is named after Kossuth, and the Kossuth Memorial is an important scene of national ceremonies. Most cities in Hungary have streets named after Kossuth, see: Public place names of Budapest. The first public statue commemorating Kossuth was erected in Miskolc in 1898. Kossuth Rádió, the main radio station of Hungary, is named after Lajos Kossuth.

Béla Bartók also wrote a symphonic poem named &quot;Kossuth,&quot; the funeral march which was transcribed for piano and published in Bartók&#x27;s lifetime.

The memorials to Lajos Kossuth in the territories lost by Hungary after World War I, and again after World War II, were sooner or later demolished in neighboring countries. A few of them were re-erected following the Revolutions of 1989 by local councils or private associations. They play an important role as symbols of national identity of the Hungarian minority.
Magyar Posta paid homage to Kossuth by bringing out eight postage stamps. Again, a set of four stamps commemorating 50th anniversary of the death of Lajos Kossuth were issued by Hungary on 20 March 1944

===In Slovakia===
The most important memorial outside the present-day borders of Hungary is a statue in Rožňava, that was knocked down twice but restored after much controversy in 2004.

Mlynská ulica in Košice, an important street in the historic city center used to be called Lajos Kossut utca for most of its history.

===In Romania===
The only Kossuth statue that remained on its place after 1920 in Romania stands in Salonta. The demolished Kossuth Memorial of Târgu-Mureş was re-erected in 2001 in the little Székely village of Ciumani. The Kossuth Memorial in Arad, the work of Ede Margó from 1909, was removed by the order of the Brătianu government in 1925.

===In the United Kingdom===
There is a blue plaque on No. 39 Chepstow Villas, the house in Notting Hill in London, where Kossuth lived from 1850 to 1859. A street in Greenwich, also in London, is named Kossuth Street after him. There is a letter of support from Kossuth on display at the Wallace Monument, near Stirling. The building of the monument, dedicated to Scottish patriot William Wallace coincided with Kossuth&#x27;s visit to Scotland.

===Rest of Europe===
In Serbia there are two statues of Kossuth in Stara Moravica and Novi Itebej. Memorials in Ukraine are situated in Berehove and Tiachiv. Lajos Kossuth Street exists in the cities of Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Mukachevo, Tyachiv, Uzhhorod. The house where Kossuth lived in exile in Shumen, Bulgaria, has been turned into the Lajos Kossuth Memorial House, exhibiting documents and items related to Kossuth&#x27;s work and the Hungarian Revolution. A street in the centre of the Bulgarian capital Sofia also bears his name.

The house where Kossuth lived when in exile, on Macar Street (meaning &quot;Hungarian Street&quot; in Turkish) in Kütahya, Turkey, is now a museum (Kossuth Evi Müzesi). The house is on a hill, with two stories in the back and one facing Macar Street. The walled back yard has a life size statue of Kossuth. The interior is furnished with period pieces, and houses a portrait of Kossuth and a map of his travels.

In Turin, Italy, there is a plaque on the building in which Kossuth lived, as well as a street bearing his name (Corso Luigi Kossuth).

===In the United States===

Kossuth County, Iowa, is named in Kossuth&#x27;s honor. A statue of the freedom fighter stands in front of the county Court House in Algona, Iowa, the county seat. The small towns of Kossuth, Ohio, Kossuth, Mississippi, Kossuth, Maine, Kossuth, Pennsylvania, and Kossuth, Wisconsin, as well as a populated area within the town of Bolivar, New York are named in honor of Kossuth.

A bust of Kossuth sits in the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., which also boasts a Hungarian-American cultural center called Kossuth House (owned and operated by the Hungarian Reformed Federation of America). A statue of Kossuth stands in New York City on Riverside Drive at 113th Street near the Columbia University campus. Other statues of Kossuth are sprinkled throughout the US, including in University Circle in Cleveland, Ohio There is a Kossuth Park at the intersection of East 121st Street and East Shaker Boulevard, just west of Shaker Square, in Cleveland. There are streets named in his honor in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Utica, Ronkonkoma, and Bohemia in New York State; Newark, Haledon, and Wharton in New Jersey; St. Louis, Missouri; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Lafayette, Indiana; and Columbus, Ohio. There is also a neighborhood in Dayton, Ohio known as the Kossuth Colony Historic District.

During an impassioned eulogy of Kossuth in New York, Alexander Kohut, a distinguished rabbinic scholar, took ill, and died several weeks later.

The bust of Kossuth that was added to the United States Capitol in 1990 is presently displayed in that building&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Foyer&quot; alongside busts of Václav Havel and Winston Churchill.

===In Canada===
Kossuth Road in Cambridge, Ontario, Canada was named in Kossuth&#x27;s honor as is Kossuth Park Wainfleet, Ontario Port Colborne, Ontario.

===In Kurdistan, Iraq===
The main street in Rawanduz was renamed in Kossuth&#x27;s honor in 2017.

<doc id="383578" wikidata="Q455008" url="?curid=383578" title="Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz">
<text>General Alfred Candidus Ferdinand, Prince of Windischgrätz (; 11 May 178721 March 1862), a member of an old Austro-Bohemian House of Windischgrätz, was a Field Marshal in the Austrian army. He is most noted for his service during the Napoleonic Wars and for his role in suppressing the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire.

==Early life and ancestry==
Originally from Styria, the Windischgrätz dynasty had received &quot;Inkolat&quot; rights of nobility by the Bohemian Crown in 1574.

Alfred was born in Brussels, then capital of the Austrian Netherlands, the son of Count Joseph Nicholas of Windischgrätz (1744–1802) and his second wife, Duchess Maria Leopoldine Franziska of Arenberg (1751–1812).

With the help of his mother&#x27;s rich dowry, the family took its residence at Tachau (Tachov), the lordship having been purchased by Alfred&#x27;s father in 1781.

==Napoleon==
He started service in the Habsburg imperial army in 1804. As an Austrian army officer he distinguished himself throughout the wars fought by the Habsburg Monarchy in the 19th century.

Windisch-Grätz participated in every war against Napoleon and fought with distinction at the Battle of Leipzig and in the campaign of 1814. In 1833, he was named Field Marshal-Lieutenant (German: &quot;Feldmarschall-leutnant&quot;).

==Bohemia==

In 1840, Prince Windischgrätz was appointed as military commander of the city of Prague. Eight years later, during the initial uprisings of the Vienna revolution he was temporarily granted military control of the army surrounding the city, and favoured subduing the revolting citizenry by force. However, facing hostility from government ministers within city who favoured compromise, he was compelled to retire and return to his position in Prague, the incident causing him to be viewed in an unpopular light by the Austrian population at large and garnering a lot of negative press amongst the population of Prague.

Nevertheless, the events of Vienna left a firm impression on the Prince, who witnessed first hand the consequences of being ill-prepared for a popular insurrection and made moves to take the necessary precautions within the city he was governing. Over the following month of April he proceeded to beef up the military presence within Prague, increasing the number of soldiers and fortifying strategic positions throughout the city. This only further angered the population of Prague who viewed his precautions with hostility and suspicion. The city, being in a state of increase excitement due to the revolutionary chaos across the European continent during 1848.

On the 7th of June, a large group amassed to petition for the Princes dismissal. 3 days later an even larger meeting consisting of many students and citizens gathered to demand the withdrawal of soldiers from their strategic positions and a request for 2000 muskets and 80,000 cartridges, and a single battery for personal use by the cities population. A deputation of students were sent to wait on Windischgrätz for his response, put he refused to grant the petition. In compliance with deputation and the wishes of the civil governor of the city Count Thun however, he did removed an artillery battery from Joseph&#x27;s Barracks within the city to the Hradshin, which the population felt particularly threatened by.

By now however, civil disturbances within the city were only increasing and by the 12th of June the discontent was reaching a boiling point. Citizens were insulting soldiers in the streets and fights between the military and armed revolutionaries were breaking out all over the city as the population built up barricades. An attempt by Archduke Ferdinand to pacify the situation failed as, appearing in the streets with several other city officials urging the population to put down their weapons, the city mayor Prince Lubkowitz was shot at and his aid Lieutenant Gustaker had a horse killed under him. The city was now in full revolt against imperial authority.

At this time in the evening Windischgrätz&#x27;s wife was killed within her own house, dying by a shot discharged from the upper windows of the hotel named &quot;The Golden Angel&quot;, which was immediately opposite to the quarters of the general commandant. A few moments after this event, Windischgrätz descended from his office into the streets and addressed the large crowd of citizens:

&quot;&quot;Gentlemen, if the object of this vile serenade is to insult me as an individual, because I belong to the aristocracy, then you should go before my own hotel, where, unmolested, you may gratify your desire; but if, in making the demonstration before this building, you design to cast contempt upon the military commander of the city, I warn you that I shall punish such an attempt by every means in my power. Notwithstanding my wife lies now behind me in her blood, I conjure you in all kindness to depart, and not compel me to use against you all the force and power at my command.&quot;&quot;

Once he was finished his speech several members of the crowd rushed up and seized him, hurrying him to the nearest lamppost where a cord was prepared to hang him. He was quickly saved by the intervention of his soldiers and he then declared martial law throughout Bohemia.

==Hungary==

Appointed to the chief command against the Hungarian revolutionaries under Lajos Kossuth, he gained some early successes and reoccupied Buda and Pest (January 1849), but by his slowness in pursuit he allowed the enemy to rally in superior numbers and to prevent an effective concentration of the Austrian forces.

In April 1849 he was relieved of his command after being defeated by Artúr Görgei during the Battle of Isaszeg. After his defeat he rarely appeared again in public life.

==Personal life==

On 15 June 1817 he married his cousin, Princess Eleonore of Schwarzenberg (1796–1848), who was shot dead during 1848 Revolution. She was daughter of Prince Josef Johann of Schwarzenberg and his wife, Duchess Pauline of Arenberg (1774–1810). They had seven children, five sons and two daughters.

==Quotes==
(In reference to rebellious constitutionalists) &quot;They do not want to hear about the Grace of God? They will hear the grace of the cannon.&quot;

==Honours==
He received the following orders and decorations:

<text>Radley Metzger (also known as Radley Henry Metzger, Radley H. Metzger and by the pseudonyms, &quot;Jake Barnes&quot;, &quot;Erich Farina&quot; and &quot;Henry Paris&quot;) (January 21, 1929 – March 31, 2017) was an American pioneering filmmaker and film distributor, most noted for popular artistic, adult-oriented films, including &quot;Thérèse and Isabelle&quot; (1968), &quot;Camille 2000&quot; (1969), &quot;The Lickerish Quartet&quot; (1970), &quot;Score&quot; (1974), &quot;The Private Afternoons of Pamela Mann&quot; (1974), &quot;The Image&quot; (1975), &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; (1976) and &quot;Barbara Broadcast&quot; (1977). According to one film reviewer, Metzger&#x27;s films, including those made during the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984), are noted for their &quot;lavish design, witty screenplays, and a penchant for the unusual camera angle&quot;. Another reviewer noted that his films were &quot;highly artistic — and often cerebral ... and often featured gorgeous cinematography&quot;. Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.

==Early life==
Radley Henry Metzger was born on January 21, 1929, on the Grand Concourse in The Bronx, New York City, and was the second son of Jewish parents, Julius and Anne. He claimed he found relief from his allergies in movie theaters, especially at the Audubon Ballroom theatre, while growing up. Later, Metzger received a B.A. in Dramatic Arts from City College of New York, where he studied with filmmakers Hans Richter and Leo Seltzer. He also studied acting privately with director Harold Clurman. During the Korean War, Metzger served in the U. S. Air Force with the 1350th Photographic Group, which interrupted his graduate studies at Columbia University. His older brother, now deceased, had become a physician. Metzger later married and had a daughter.

==Career==
Early in his career, in the 1950s, Metzger worked primarily as a film editor and was a member of Local 771 of the IATSE. He was employed in editing trailers for Janus Films, a major distributor of foreign art films, especially those of Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut. In 1953, Metzger was credited as assistant director to William Kyriakis on the film &quot;Guerilla Girl&quot;. In 1956, he worked on the dubbing of &quot;And God Created Woman&quot; starring Brigitte Bardot. His directorial film debut, &quot;Dark Odyssey&quot; (1961) (co-directed with Kyriakis), was a drama concerning the experiences of a Greek immigrant arriving in New York. The film was favorably reviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and others. In 1959, he edited the film &quot;The Gangster Story&quot; starring Walter Matthau and, in 1960, Metzger was a presenter for the Japanese film &quot;The Warped Ones&quot;.

Later, in 1961, along with film distributor Ava Leighton, Metzger founded Audubon Films. The company was named after the Audubon Ballroom theatre, one of his favorite movie theaters while growing up. The newly founded distribution company specialized in importing international features, some of which were marketed into the gradually expanding adult erotic film genre. Metzger&#x27;s skills as an editor were employed in re-cutting and augmenting many of the features Audubon handled, including &quot;The Twilight Girls&quot; (FR,1957) and, their first runaway success, Mac Ahlberg &quot;I, a Woman&quot; (DN/SW,1965).

Metzger&#x27;s second directorial effort, &quot;The Dirty Girls&quot; (shot in 1963 and released in 1965), marked his emergence as a major auteur in the adult erotic film genre. His subsequent films were often shot in Europe and adapted from novels or other literary sources, including &quot;Carmen&quot; (by Prosper Mérimée), &quot;La Dame aux Camélias&quot; (by Alexandre Dumas), &quot;L&#x27;image&quot; (by Catherine Robbe-Grillet), &quot;Naked Came the Stranger&quot; (by Penelope Ashe), &quot;Pygmalion&quot; (by George Bernard Shaw), &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot; (by Luigi Pirandello), &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (by John Willard), and &quot;Thérèse et Isabelle&quot; (by Violette Leduc). He cites John Farrow, Claude Lelouch, Michael Powell, Alain Resnais and Orson Welles as influencing his work. Metzger worked with the French film director Jean Renoir, as well as the American actor Hal Linden. Andy Warhol, who helped begin the Golden Age of Porn with his 1969 film &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, was a fan of Metzger&#x27;s film work and commented that Metzger&#x27;s 1970 film, &quot;The Lickerish Quartet&quot;, was “an outrageously kinky masterpiece”. In 1972, Metzger directed the film &quot;Score&quot;, based on an erotic off-Broadway play that included Sylvester Stallone. Films directed by Metzger included musical scores composed by Georges Auric, Stelvio Cipriani, Georges Delerue, and Piero Piccioni. Metzger&#x27;s signature film style of his &quot;elegant erotica&quot; had developed into being &quot;a Euro-centric combination of stylish decadence, wealth and the aristocratic&quot;.

Under the pseudonym &quot;Henry Paris,&quot; Metzger also directed several explicit adult erotic features during the mid- to late-1970s. These films were released during the Golden Age of Porn (inaugurated by the 1969 release of Andy Warhol &quot;Blue Movie&quot;) in the United States, at a time of &quot;porno chic&quot;, in which adult erotic films were just beginning to be widely released, publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope) and taken seriously by film critics (like Roger Ebert). Metzger&#x27;s films are typified by high production values, especially &quot;The Private Afternoons of Pamela Mann&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; (1976), and are generally critically celebrated. Some historians assess &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot;, based on the play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; by George Bernard Shaw (and its derivative, &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;), as attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets and is considered, by award-winning author Toni Bentley, the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the Golden Age of Porn.

Some of the adult erotic &quot;Henry Paris&quot; films, including &quot;Score&quot; (1974), have also been presented in softcore versions. Many of Metzger&#x27;s films, including &quot;Score&quot; (1974), &quot;The Image&quot; (1975), &quot;The Opening of Misty Beethoven&quot; (1976) and &quot;Barbara Broadcast&quot; (1977), as well as his earlier softcore films, &quot;Camille 2000&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Lickerish Quartet&quot; (1970), have been released in Blu-ray versions.

With his 1978 feature &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot;, Metzger distinguished himself as one of the few adult film auteurs to direct a dramatic feature outside of the adult erotic film genre. The film starred Honor Blackman, Edward Fox, Dame Wendy Hiller and Carol Lynley.

==Later life==
In the 1990s, as a result of the passing of his long-time partner, Ava Leighton, due to cancer, Metzger produced several videos on alternative health care, including one on cancer treatment and a five-part video series on homeopathy with Dr. Andrew Weil. According to Metzger: &quot;I felt that in the 1990s, people needed more information on an intelligent approach to health and disease — that they needed to know about alleviating guilt. That was my emphasis.&quot;

Later in life, Metzger considered several &quot;Henry Paris&quot;-like film projects, including one titled &quot;Solarium&quot;, another one based on the book &quot;The Surrender&quot; by Toni Bentley, and a third one based on his own original script, using Shakespearean dialogue, tentatively titled &quot;The Heat of the Midnight Sun&quot;. However, all of these film projects were ultimately left unfinished.

According to film reviewer Adam Schartoff of &quot;Filmmaker Magazine&quot; in April 2017, Metzger was a &quot;truly unique and exquisitely talented director&quot;, his films had &quot;strong visuals and narratives ... whimsical, funny, intelligent and always ambitious stories&quot;, his treatment of female characters were &quot;way beyond his time&quot;. Schartoff and a producing partner, Judith Mizrachy, considered making a documentary overview about Metzger and his films, but the project currently is unfinished.

Film and audio works by Metzger have been added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.

==Death==

<text>Albion Woodbury Small (May 11, 1854 – March 24, 1926) founded the first independent department of sociology in the United States at the University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois, in 1892. He was influential in the establishment of sociology as a valid field of academic study.

==Biography==
Albion Woodbury Small was born in Buckfield, Maine, to parents Reverend Albion Keith Parris Small and Thankful Lincoln Woodbury. His ancestors settled in Maine in 1632. He lived in Bangor, Maine, and then Portland, Maine, where he attended public schools in both places.

He attended Colby University, now known as Colby College, from 1872 until he graduated in 1876. He studied theology from 1876 to 1879 at the Andover Newton Theological School. From 1879 to 1881 he studied at the University of Leipzig and the University of Berlin in Germany history, social economics and politics. While in Germany, he married Valeria von Massow in June 1881, with whom he had one child.

In the fall of 1881, he became chair of history and political economy at Colby College.

From 1888 to 1889 he studied history at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and was promoted in 1889 with a PhD thesis (&quot;The Beginnings of American Nationality&quot;) at the same time continuing to teach at Colby College. From 1889 to 1892 he was the 10th president of Colby.

In 1892 he founded the first department of sociology at the University of Chicago. He chaired this department for over 30 years. In 1894 he, along with George E. Vincent, published the first textbook in sociology: An introduction to the study of society. In 1895 he established the American Journal of Sociology. From 1905 to 1925 he served as Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Literature at the University of Chicago.

Albion Woodbury Small was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Xi chapter).

== Influence on sociology ==
Albion Small can be attributed with many &quot;firsts&quot; in the field of sociology. In 1892, he helped to create a department of social science at the University of Chicago, which was the first-ever sociology department in the United States. Then, in 1894, along with colleague George E. Vincent, he wrote the first sociology textbook titled &quot;An Introduction to the Study of Society.&quot; Lastly, he founded the first Sociology Journal in the United States in 1895, the &quot;American Journal of Sociology.&quot;

<doc id="383589" wikidata="Q14970920" url="?curid=383589" title="Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)">
<text>The British Merchant Navy is the collective name given to British civilian ships and their associated crews, including officers and ratings. In the UK, it is simply referred to as the Merchant Navy or MN. Merchant Navy vessels fly the Red Ensign and the ships and crew are regulated by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), a specialist agency of the UK Department of Transport. British merchant ships are registered under the UK or Red Ensign group ship registries. British Merchant Navy deck officers and ratings are certificated and trained according to STCW Convention and the syllabus of the Merchant Navy Training Board in maritime colleges and other training institutes around the UK.

King George V bestowed the title of &quot;Merchant Navy&quot; on the British merchant shipping fleets following their service in the First World War; a number of other nations have since adopted the title. Previously it had been known as the Mercantile Marine or Merchant Service, although the term &quot;Merchant Navy&quot; was already informally used from the 19th century. 

The British Merchant Navy was historically one of the largest ship registries and source of crew in the world, with 33% of global tonnage registered in 1939. However, since the mid 20th century, the number of shipowners, ships, officers and crew have declined dramatically as a result of globalisation and the rise of flags of convenience. As of 2023, the British Merchant Navy numbered 1,054 ships.

==History==
The Merchant Navy has been in existence for a significant period in English and British history, owing its growth to trade and imperial expansion. It can be dated back to the 17th century, when an attempt was made to register all seafarers as a source of labour for the Royal Navy in times of conflict. That registration of merchant seafarers failed, and it was not successfully implemented until 1835.
The merchant fleet grew over successive years to become the world&#x27;s foremost merchant fleet, benefiting considerably from trade with British possessions in India and the Far East. The lucrative trades in sugar, contraband opium to China, spices, and tea (carried by ships such as the &quot;Cutty Sark&quot;) helped to entrench this dominance in the 19th century.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, maritime education expanded to train merchant navy officers. For example, in 1855 Leith Nautical College provided training for seafarers in Scotland. Other maritime colleges developed in this period included the South Tyneside Marine and Technical College, founded 1861 (now the South Tyneside College) and the Southampton School of Navigation, 1902 (now the Warsash Maritime School).

In the First and Second World Wars, the merchant service suffered heavy losses from German U-boat attacks. A policy of unrestricted warfare meant that merchant seafarers were at risk of attack from enemy ships. The tonnage lost to U-boats in the First World War was around 7,759,090 tons, and around 14,661 merchant seafarers were killed. In honour of the sacrifice made by merchant seafarers in the First World War, George V granted the title &quot;Merchant Navy&quot; to the companies.

In 1928 George V gave Edward, Prince of Wales the title of &quot;Master of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets&quot;; which he retained after his accession to the throne in January 1936 and relinquished only at his abdication that December. Since Edward VIII, the title has been held by the sovereigns George VI and Elizabeth II. When the United Kingdom and the British Empire entered the Second World War in September 1939, George VI issued this message:

&quot;In these anxious days, I would like to express to all Officers and Men and in the British Merchant Navy and the British Fishing Fleets my confidence in their unfailing determination to play their vital part in defence. To each one I would say: Yours is a task no less essential to my people&#x27;s experience than that allotted to the Navy, Army and Air Force. Upon you, the Nation depends for much of its foodstuffs and raw materials and for the transport of its troops overseas. You have a long and glorious history, and I am proud to bear the title &quot;Master of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets&quot;. I know that you will carry out your duties with resolution and with fortitude, and that high chivalrous traditions of your calling are safe in your hands. God keep you and prosper you in your great task.&quot;

During the Second World War, German U-boats sank nearly 14.7 million tons of Allied shipping, which amounted to 2,828 ships (around two-thirds of the total allied tonnage lost). The United Kingdom alone suffered the loss of 11.7 million tons, which was 54% of the total Merchant Navy fleet at the outbreak of the Second World War. 32,000 merchant seafarers were killed aboard convoy vessels in the war, but along with the Royal Navy, the convoys successfully imported enough supplies to allow an Allied victory.

Between 1941 and 1949, the SR Merchant Navy class steam locomotives were built in the UK. Each locomotive of the class was named after British shipping lines from the Second World War, principally those operating out of Southampton.

In honour of the sacrifices made in both World Wars, representatives of the Merchant Navy lay wreaths of remembrance alongside the armed forces in the annual Remembrance Day service on 11 November. Following many years of lobbying to bring about official recognition of the sacrifices made by merchant seafarers in the two world wars and since, Merchant Navy Day became an official day of remembrance on 3 September 2000.

The merchant navy was also called upon to serve during the Falklands War and provided forty vessels, including transports, tankers and other vessels, with a total of 500,000 grt. The merchant ship SS Atlantic Conveyor, being used to ferry 
Harrier fighters and other aircraft to the South Atlantic, was lost during the conflict after being struck by an air-launched Exocet missile. The ship&#x27;s captain, Ian North, and 11 other crew members died in the attack which constituted the first loss of a British merchant navy ship to an armed attack since the Second World War.

Historically a person wishing to become a captain, or master prior to about 1969, had three choices: to attend one of the three elite naval schools from the age of 12, the fixed-base HMS &quot;Conway&quot; and HMS &quot;Worcester&quot; or Pangbourne Nautical College, which would automatically lead to an apprenticeship as a seagoing cadet officer; apply to one of several training programmes elsewhere; or go to sea immediately by applying directly to a merchant shipping company at about age 17. Then there would be three years (with prior training or four years without) of seagoing experience aboard ship, in work-clothes and as mates with the deck crew, under the direction of the bo&#x27;sun cleaning bilges, chipping paint, polishing brass, cement washing freshwater tanks, and holystoning teak decks, and studying navigation and seamanship on the bridge in uniform, under the direction of an officer, before taking exams to become a second mate.

Historically, the composition of the crew on UK ships was diverse. This was a characteristic of the extant of the shipping companies trade, the extent of the British Empire and the availability of crew in different ports. One ship might have a largely all British crew, while another might have a crew composed of many Indians, Chinese or African sailors. Crews from outside Britain were usually drawn from areas in which the ship traded, so Far East trading ships had either Singapore or Hong Kong crews, banana boats had West Indian crews, ships trading to West Africa and Southern Africa had African crews and ships trading to the Indian Ocean (including East Africa) had crews from the Indian subcontinent. Crews made up of recruits from Britain itself were commonly used on ships trading across the North Atlantic, to South America and to Australia and New Zealand.

==Merchant Navy today==
===Fleet===

Despite maintaining its dominant position for many decades, the decline of the British Empire, the rise of the use of the flag of convenience, and foreign competition led to the decline of the merchant fleet. For example, in 1939 the Merchant Navy was the largest in the world with 33% of total tonnage. By 2012, the Merchant Navy – while still remaining one of the largest in the world – held only 3% of total tonnage.

In 2010 the Merchant Navy consisted of 504 UK registered ships of or over. In addition, UK merchant marine interests possessed a further 308 ships registered in other countries and 271 foreign-owned ships were registered in the UK.

In 2012 British merchant marine interests consisted of 1,504 ships of or over. This included ships either directly UK-owned, parent-owned or managed by a British company. This amounted to: or alternatively . This is according to the annual maritime shipping statistics provided by the British Government and the Department for Transport. In the last decade, ship numbers have continued to decline. In 2023, the British Ship Register had reduced to 1,054 ships.

===Officers and ratings===

As a signatory to the STCW Convention UK ships are commanded by deck officers and engineering officers. Officers undergo 3 years of training, known as a cadetship at one of the approved maritime colleges in the United Kingdom. These include Warsash Maritime Academy, South Tyneside College, Fleetwood, Plymouth University and City of Glasgow College. Cadets usually have a choice of two academic routes: Foundation Degree or Higher National Diploma. Successful completion of this results in a qualification in marine operations or marine engineering. Generally the costs of a cadetship will be met by sponsorship from a UK shipping company. During the three years of training, cadets also go to sea, for a period of a year or more, usually spread across the cadetship. This affords a practical education, that along with the academic time in college prepares a candidate for a separate and final oral exam. This oral exam is carried out with a master mariner at an office of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Successful completion of the oral exam will result in the award of a certificate of competency. This is the international qualification, issued by the UK government which allows an officer to work in their qualified capacity on board a ship. Certificates are issued for different ranks and as such an officer will usually return to complete a subsequent series of studies until they reach the highest qualification.

The first UK deck officer certificates of competency were issued in 1845, conducted then, as now, by a final oral exam with a master mariner. The training regime for officers is set out in the official syllabus of the Merchant Navy Training Board. This training still encompasses all of the traditional trades such as celestial navigation, ship stability, general cargo and seamanship, but now includes training in business, legislation, law, and computerisation for deck officers and marine engineering principles, workshop technology, steam propulsion, motor (diesel) propulsion, auxiliaries, mechanics, thermodynamics, engineering drawing, ship construction, marine electrics as well as practical workshop training for engineering officers.

Traditionally and still now, the ships ratings are supervised by the bosun, as overseen by a responsible deck officer, usually the chief mate. A ship may also have different sub-departments, such as the galley, radio department or hospitality services, overseen by a chief cook, radio officer or chief steward. Many of these roles have now changed, as ships crews have become smaller in commercial shipping. On most ships the radio department has disappeared, along with the radio officer (colloquially known as &#x27;sparks&#x27;) replaced by changes in technology and the requirement under the STCW Convention for deck officers to hold individual certification in the GMDSS system. Electro-technical officers (ETO) also serve aboard some ships and are trained to fix and maintain the more complex systems.

In 2023, the UK Merchant Navy had 10,930 certificated officers, 10,180 ratings, 1,450 merchant navy cadets and 1,540 other officers.

===Charities===
Merchant navy related charities are active in the UK. The Merchant Navy Welfare Board administers the MN fund for charitable support. Other charities include the Shipwrecked&#x27; Mariners Society, the Seafarer&#x27;s Charity, the Scottish Nautical Welfare Society and the Scottish Shipping Benevolent Association.

==Flags==
===Ensigns===
Ensigns are displayed at the stern of the vessel or displayed on the gaff, on a yardarm. Red Ensigns can be defaced, those can only be flown with a warrant on board the vessel. Bermuda (historically part of British North America, but left out of the Confederation of Canada) flies the red ensign also as a territorial flag on land, as did other British North American colonies that still do so as Provinces of modern Canada, including Ontario (other British Overseas Territories that fly a nautical ensign as the territorial flag on land use the Blue Ensign which in Bermuda is only flown from civil government vessels such as ferry boats).

====British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies ensigns====
====Yacht club ensigns====
====Institution ensigns====
===House flags===
House flags are personal and designed by a company. A house flag is displayed on a port halyard of a Yardarm.

==Medals and awards==
Members of the UK Merchant Navy have been awarded the Victoria Cross, George Cross, George Medal, Distinguished Service Order, and Distinguished Service Cross for their actions while serving in the Merchant Navy. Canadian Philip Bent, ex-British Merchant Navy, joined the British Army at the outbreak of World War I and won the Victoria Cross. Members of the Merchant Navy who served in either World War also received relevant campaign medals.

In the Second World War many Merchant Navy members received the King&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct. Lloyd&#x27;s of London awarded the Lloyd&#x27;s War Medal for Bravery at Sea to 541 Merchant Navy personnel for their bravery in 1939–45. Many Royal Humane Society medals and awards have been conferred on Merchant Navy seafarers for acts of humanity in both war and peacetime.

In September 2016 the UK Government introduced the Merchant Navy Medal for Meritorious Service. The medal is awarded:

&quot;to those who are serving or have served in the Merchant Navy and fishing fleets of the UK, Isle of Man or Channel Islands for exemplary service and devotion to duty, rewarding those who have set an outstanding example to others.&quot;

It is the first state award for meritorious service in the history of the Merchant Navy. Recipients must be nominated by someone other than themselves, with at least two written letters of support and are normally required to have completed 20 years service in the Merchant Navy (although in exceptional circumstances it may be less).

<text>Kenny Davis Anthony (born 8 January 1951) is a Saint Lucian politician who was Prime Minister of Saint Lucia from 1997 to 2006 and again from 2011 to 2016. As leader of the Saint Lucia Labour Party, he was Leader of the Opposition from 2006 to 2011 and returned to office as Prime Minister on 30 November 2011 following the 2011 election. He left office after the SLP&#x27;s defeat in the 2016 election and announced his resignation as party leader.

==Political career==
Anthony is a graduate of the University of the West Indies at Cave Hill and the University of Birmingham. In the Labour government that led the country from 1979 to 1982, Anthony was Special Advisor to the Ministry of Education and Culture from August 1979 to December 1980, then Minister of Education from December 1980 to March 1981. He was a member of the secretariat of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) from March 1995 until he was elected leader of the Labour Party.

He became Prime Minister on 24 May 1997, a day after the SLP won parliamentary elections. While Prime Minister, he was also the Minister of Finance and Broadcasting.

During his leadership and his party&#x27;s reign, Anthony led St. Lucia to record development in tourism, infrastructure and general economic development. However, imbalances in the economic development, disenfranchisement and raising crime levels are challenges his administration had difficulty to tackle. Since he regained power in 2011 there has been an increase in the number of impoverish persons on the island. Together with much economic development came steady increases in violent crime at a rate higher than many neighbouring islands and that caused many to draw comparisons with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago.

Kenny D. Anthony is an Honorary Member of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation.

==General election defeat==
In the general elections held on 11 December 2006, the SLP suffered a surprise defeat by 11 seats to 6 at the hands of the John Compton-led UWP. While the SLP lost the election by 5 seats, the popular vote margin was in fact very slim, just over 2000 votes.

Anthony himself won a handsome victory in his constituency, Vieux Fort South, winning by 627 votes, only a few less than in the SLP&#x27;s landslide election victory. Anthony remained head of the party and assumed the role of Leader of the Opposition.

An interesting twist to the 2006 elections saga is that many feel that St. Lucians went to the polls not to elect a new government but to ensure that there would be a tougher opposition as against the 16–1 majority that the SLP had previously enjoyed. In a fate of irony, voters perhaps over-compensated for the frequent poll reports and political pundits&#x27; predictions that the SLP would again win a third term with a 14–3 majority. Many feel that, had Anthony himself not latched on to those poll results, he might have been better able to convince his own supporters that they were not yet in the clear and to turn out to vote in larger numbers.

Further, the reaction of many voters to the crossing over of former UWP leader Vaughan Lewis to the SLP was not positive. Lewis was a staunch opponent of the Labour government and the former Prime Minister who had lost the elections to the SLP - albeit after being handed the post only one year before the fateful loss. Anthony and Lewis have both stated publicly that all the &quot;bad blood&quot; between them was now &quot;water under the bridge&quot;.

In late July 2007, Anthony said that Compton&#x27;s illness, caused by a series of strokes, and his inability to perform his duties - Stephenson King was named acting Prime Minister - meant that a new election should be held. Anthony was head of the Commonwealth of Nations observer mission in the August 2007 election in Sierra Leone. He gave the election a positive appraisal.

In March 2008, Anthony visited Cuba where he voiced his appreciation for its support of Saint Lucia. He toured Havana and Cienfuegos Province, and met with senior officials including First Vice President José Ramón Machado Ventura.

Anthony was returned to Prime Ministership on 30 November 2011 following the Saint Lucia Labour Party electoral win at the 2011 elections, winning 11 out of the 17 seats in Parliament.

Following the general elections on 6 June 2016 in which the SLP lost by 11 seats to six, Anthony announced that he would step down as party leader. He was re-elected in his constituency of Vieux Fort South and said that he would remain in Parliament.
