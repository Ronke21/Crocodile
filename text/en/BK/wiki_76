<doc id="387766" wikidata="Q1542710" url="?curid=387766" title="Radical Party (France)">
<text>The Radical Party (, ), officially the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party ( ), is a liberal and social-liberal political party in France. Since 1971, to prevent confusion with the Radical Party of the Left (PRG), it has also been referred to as &quot;Parti radical valoisien&quot;, after its headquarters on the rue de Valois. The party&#x27;s name has been variously abbreviated to PRRRS, Rad, PR and PRV. Founded in 1901, the PR is the oldest active political party in France.

Coming from the Radical Republican tradition, the PR upheld the principles of private property, social justice and secularism. The Radicals were originally a left-wing group, but, starting with the emergence of the French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) in 1905, they shifted gradually towards the political centre. In 1926, its right-wing split off to form the Unionist (or National) Radicals. In 1971 the party&#x27;s left-wing split off to form the PRG. The PR then affiliated with the centre-right, becoming one of the founder parties of the Union for French Democracy (UDF) in 1978. In 2002, the party split from the UDF and became an associate party of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and were represented on the Liaison Committee for the Presidential Majority prior to launching The Alliance (ARES) in 2011 and the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) in 2012. After the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, negotiations to merge the PR and the PRG began. The refounding congress to reunite the parties into the Radical Movement was held in December 2017. However, the union proved short-lived and, by 2021, both the PR and PRG returned to be independent parties. The PR was then part of the Ensemble Citoyens coalition.

== History ==
=== Radicals before the party (1830–1901) ===
After the collapse of Napoleon&#x27;s empire in 1815, a reactionary Bourbon Restoration took place. The left-wing opposition was constituted by the broad family of Republicans, but these differed over whether and how far to cooperate with liberal-constitutional monarchists in pursuit of their common adversary. In contrast to the Republicans&#x27; right wing (then the centre-left of the political spectrum), who were more inclined to accept a socially conservative constitutional monarchy as the first stage to a republic, the Republicans&#x27; left wing took a hard line in advocating progressive reforms such as universal manhood suffrage, civil liberties (such as press freedom and right to assembly, among others), and the immediate installation of a republican constitution. They came to be termed Radical Republicans by opposition to the Moderate Republicans.

After the installation of the constitutional July Monarchy (1830–1848), the term Republican was outlawed and the regime&#x27;s remaining Republican opponents adopted the term Radical for themselves. Following the monarchy&#x27;s conservative turn, Alexandre Ledru-Rollin and Louis Blanc formulated a Radical doctrine. At this time, radicalism was distinct from and to the left of the July Monarchy&#x27;s doctrinal liberalism. Radicals defended traditional peasant farmers and small craftsmen against the new rival economic projects of the 19th century, socialist collectivism and capitalist big business alike.

The Radicals took a major part in the 1848 Revolution and the foundation of the Second Republic, sitting in parliament as the Montagne legislative group. Fifty years later, the Radical-Socialist Party would consider this group its direct forefather. For a few months, Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin was Interior Minister in the provisional government. However, the conservatives won the 1848 legislative election, the first election by universal suffrage. The repression of the June 1848 workers&#x27; demonstrations disappointed the left-wing supporters of the new regime. Ledru-Rollin obtained only 5% of votes at the December 1848 presidential election, which was won by Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, who launched a coup, ending parliamentary democracy in favour of a Second Empire.

From opposition, Radicals criticized Bonaparte&#x27;s autocratic rule and attacks on civil liberties. At the end of the 1860s, they advocated with the Belleville Programme (supported by Léon Gambetta) the election of civil servants and mayors, the proclamation of the so-called &quot;great liberties&quot;, free public teaching and the separation of church and state.

After the collapse of the Second French Empire following the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, the Third Republic was proclaimed in September 1870. The first elections in February 1871 returned a majority of monarchists belonging to two distinct factions, conservative-liberal Orléanists and Catholic-traditionalist Legitimists, but these were too divided to reach an agreement over the type of monarchy they wanted to restore. Their division allowed time for the Republicans to win the 1876 elections, leading to the firm establishment of a Republican republic. Like the monarchists, the Republicans were divided into two main factions, namely a centre-left formed of socially-conservative yet liberal and secular Moderate Republicans (pejoratively labeled &quot;Opportunist Republicans&quot;) and a far-left of uncompromising anticlerical Radicals. Georges Clemenceau was the leader of the Radical parliamentary group, who criticized colonial policy as a form of diversion from &quot;revenge&quot; against Prussia and due to his ability was a protagonist of the collapse of many governments.

In the 1890s, competition from the growing labour movement and concern for the plight of industrial workers prompted Léon Bourgeois to update the fifty-year-old Radical doctrine to encompass social reforms such as the progressive income tax and social insurance schemes, hence the term Radical-Socialist, a social-democratic synthesis of reformist socialism with traditional radicalism. After the Dreyfus Affair, Radicals joined forces with conservative Republicans and some Socialists in Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau&#x27;s cabinet (1899–1902). In 1901, an Act on the right of association was voted and the various individual Radicals organised themselves into a political party in order to defend their governmental achievements from the Catholic Church&#x27;s influence and the traditionalist opposition. However, not all Radicals accepted the change in doctrine and alliance. While retaining their doctrines, those show rejected the new turn towards social-democracy and partnership with the Socialist Party gradually peeled away, labelling themselves the Independent Radicals and sitting in their own loose-knit parliamentary party (Radical Left) to the right of the Radical-Socialists.

The Radical-Socialist and Radical Republican Party was the first large political party established at a national level in France, which contrasted with previous parliamentary groups that were formed spontaneously by likeminded independent lawmakers elected through purely local electoral committees. The first congress of the Radical Party was held in June 1901. Delegates represented 476 election committees, 215 editorial boards of Radical newspapers and 155 Masonic lodges as well as lawmakers, mayors and municipal councillors. However, it was not until 1914 that the Radical-Socialist Party imposed strict discipline on its parliamentary deputies, requiring them to sit exclusively in a single Radical-Socialist legislative caucus.

The existence of a national party immediately changed the political scene. Several Radical independents had already been presidents of the council (Ferdinand Buisson, Emile Combes and Charles Floquet, among others) and the Radicals already benefited from a strong presence across the country. The party was composed of a heterogeneous alliance of personal fiefdoms, informal electoral clubs, masonic lodges and sections of the &quot;Ligue des droits de l&#x27;homme&quot; (Human Rights League) and the &quot;Ligue française de l&#x27;enseignement&quot; (French League of Education, an association dedicated to introducing, expanding and defending free, compulsory and non-religious primary education). The secularising cause was championed by Émile Combes&#x27; cabinet start of the 20th century. As the political enemy, they identified the Catholic Church, seen as a political campaign entity for ultra-conservatives and monarchists.

=== Early years: the Radical Republic (1901–1919) ===
At 1902 legislative election, the Radical-Socialists and the Independent Radicals allied themselves with the conservative-liberals of the Democratic Alliance (to their immediate right) and the Socialists (to their left) in the &quot;Bloc des gauches&quot; (Coalition of the Left), with the Radicals emerging the main political force. Émile Combes took the head of the &quot;Bloc des gauches&quot; cabinet and led a resolute anti-clerical policy culminating in the 1905 laic law which along with the earlier Jules Ferry laws removing confessional influence from public education formed the backbone of &quot;laïcité&quot;, France&#x27;s policy of combatting clericalism by actively excluding it from state institutions. From then on, the Radical-Socialist Party&#x27;s chief aim in domestic policy was to prevent its wide-ranging set of reforms from being overturned by a return to power of the religious right.

After the withdrawal of the Socialist ministers from the government following the International Socialist Congress of Amsterdam in 1904, the coalition dissolved and the Radicals went alone into the 1906 legislative elections. Nevertheless, the Radical-Socialist Party remained the axis of the parliamentary majorities and of the governments. The cabinet led by the Independent Radical Georges Clemenceau (1906–1909) introduced income tax and workers&#x27; pensions, but is also remembered for its violent repression of industrial strikes.

For the latter part of the Third Republic (1918–1940), the Radical-Socialists, generally representing the anti-clerical segment of peasant and petty-bourgeois voters, were usually the largest single party in parliament, but with their anti-clerical agenda accomplished the party lost their driving force. Its leader before World War I Joseph Caillaux was generally more noted for his advocacy of better relations with Germany than for his reformist agenda.

During World War I (1914–1918), the Radical-Socialist Party was the keystone of the &quot;Sacred Union&quot; while the most prominent Independent Radical Georges Clemenceau led the cabinet again from 1917 to 1919. He appeared as the &quot;architect of victory&quot;, but his relationship with the Radical-Socialist Party deteriorated. The Radical-Socialists and the Independent Radicals entered the 1919 legislative election in opposing coalitions, thus Clemenceau&#x27;s alliance of the right emerged victorious.

=== Between World Wars (1919–1946) ===
By the end of World War I, the Radical-Socialist Party, now led by Édouard Herriot, were generally a moderate centre-left party faced with the governmental dominance of the socially-conservative liberal parties to its right (see Independent Radicals and Democratic Alliance) and pressure from its left by the rise of support for the socialist French Section of the Workers&#x27; International (SFIO) and French Communist Party (PCF). With these political forces, Radical-Socialists shared anti-clericalism and the struggle for &quot;social progress&quot;, but unlike the other left parties the Radical-Socialists defended the principle of strict parliamentary action and the defence of private property, at least that of smallholders and small business. Additionally, the Radical-Socialist Party had thought before 1914 that its old adversaries among the Catholic, monarchist and traditionalist right had been weakened once and for all, instead these emerged reinvigorated by World War I.

In 1924, Radical-Socialists formed electoral alliances with the SFIO. The &quot;Cartel des Gauches&quot; (Coalition of the Left) won the 1924 legislative election and Herriot formed a government. However, the Radical-Socialists gradually drifted to the right, moving from left-Republican governments supported by the non-participating Socialists to a coalition of &quot;Republican concentration&quot; with the centre-right Independent Radicals and the more socially-conservative liberal parties in 1926.

Two years later at the Angers Congress, the left-wing of the party obtained the withdrawal of the Radical-Socialists from the cabinet and the return to a policy of alliance with the Socialists. Édouard Daladier was elected party leader. However, a section of the party&#x27;s right-wing defected to form a second centre-right Independent Radical party (the Social and Radical Left) which opposed alliance with the Socialist Party and preferred close cooperation with the centre-right liberals of the Democratic Alliance.

The party claimed 120,000 members in the 1930s, however, these figures were inflated by competitors purchasing party memberships in bulk to influence inner-party votes.

The second &quot;Cartel des gauches&quot; won the 1932 legislative election, but its two main components were not able to establish a common agenda and consequently the SFIO chose to support the second government led by Herriot without participation. The coalition fell on 7 February 1934 following riots organized by the far-right leagues the night before. The Radical-Socialist Camille Chautemps&#x27;s government had been replaced by a government led by his popular rival Édouard Daladier in January after accusations of corruption against Chautemps&#x27; government in the wake of the Stavisky Affair and other similar scandals.

This pattern of initial alliance with a socialist party unwilling to join in active government followed by disillusionment and alliance with the centre-right seemed to be broken in 1936, when the Popular Front electoral alliance with the Socialists and the Communists led to the accession of Socialist leader Léon Blum as President of the Council in a coalition government in which the Radical-Socialist leaders Édouard Daladier and Camille Chautemps (representing left and right of the Radical-Socialist Party, respectively) took important roles. For the first time in its history, the Radical-Socialist Party obtained fewer votes than the SFIO.

Over the tempestuous life of the coalition, the Radical-Socialists began to become concerned at the perceived radicalism of their coalition partners. Hence, they opposed themselves to Blum&#x27;s intention to help the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), forcing him to adopt a non-interventionist policy. Following the failure of Blum&#x27;s second government in April 1938, Daladier formed a new government in coalition with the liberal and conservative parties.

After the 29 September 1938 Munich Agreement which handed over Sudetenland to Nazi Germany in exchange for what proved to be a temporary peace, Daladier was acclaimed upon his return to Paris as the man who had avoided war. However, two days after the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 the French government led by Daladier made good on its guarantees to Poland by declaring war alongside Britain. Following the 23 August 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Daladier engaged in an anti-communist policy, prohibiting the Communists activities and the party&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;.

Furthermore, Daladier moved increasingly to the right, notably repealing the 40-hour work week which had been the Popular Front&#x27;s most visible accomplishment. Daladier would eventually resign in March 1940 and take part in the new government of Paul Reynaud (leader of the main centre-right liberal party, the Democratic Alliance) as minister of National Defense and of War. After the defeat of the Battle of France, the French army being overwhelmed by the Nazi &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, the French government declared Paris an open city on 10 June and flew to Bordeaux. The same month, Daladier escaped to Morocco in the &quot;Massilia&quot;. Thus, he was not there during the controversial 10 July 1940 vote of full powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain which opened the door to the Vichy regime. Daladier was arrested and tried in 1942 by the new regime (see the Riom Trial) which accused him as well as other political leaders such as Socialist Léon Blum and conservative Paul Reynaud of being morally and strategically responsible for the loss of the Battle of France.

=== Fourth Republic (1946–1958) ===
After World War II, the Radicals, like many of the other political parties, were discredited by the fact that many of their members had voted to grant emergency powers to Marshal Philippe Pétain, although senior Radical leaders as Édouard Herriot, then President of the Chamber of Deputies (the parliamentary Speaker), had been ambivalent.

The Radical-Socialist Party was reconstituted and formed one of the important parties of the Fourth Republic (1946–1958), but never recovered its dominant pre-war position. It failed to prevent the adoption of the projects of the three-parties coalition (nationalizations and the welfare state). Along with Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance, it set up an electoral umbrella-group, the Rally of Republican Lefts (RGR). From 1947, after the split of the governmental coalition it participated to the Third Force coalition with the SFIO, the Christian-democratic Popular Republican Movement and the conservative-liberal National Centre of Independents and Peasants.

In the early years of the Fourth Republic, the party returned to the moderate left under the leadership of Pierre Mendès-France, a strong opponent of French colonialism, whose premiership from 1954 to 1955 saw France&#x27;s withdrawal from Indochina and the agreement for French withdrawal from Tunisia. Mendès-France, a very popular figure who helped renew the Radical-Socialist Party after its discredit, was indeed elected on the pledge to stop Indochina War (1946–1954).

Mendès-France hoped to make the Radicals the party of the mainstream centre-left in France, taking advantage of the difficulties of the SFIO. The more conservative elements in the party led by Edgar Faure resisted these policies, leading to the fall of Mendès-France&#x27;s government in 1955. They split and transformed the RGR in a centre-right party distinct from the Radical Party. Under Pierre Mendès-France&#x27;s leadership, the Radical Party participated to a centre-left coalition, the Republican Front, which won the 1956 legislative election. Another split, this time over France&#x27;s policy about the Algerian War (1954–1962), led to his resignation as party leader and the party&#x27;s move in a distinctly conservative direction.

The Fourth Republic was characterized by constant parliamentary instability because of divisions between major parties over the Algerian War, which was officially called a &quot;public order operation&quot; until the 1990s. Mendès-France opposed the war and colonialism while the SFIO led by Prime Minister Guy Mollet supported it. Because of the start of the Cold War, all political parties, even the SFIO, opposed the French Communist Party (PCF), which was very popular due to its role during the Resistance (it was known as the &quot;parti des 75,000 fusillés&quot;, &quot;party of the 75,000 executed people&quot;). The PCF was also opposed to French rule in Algeria and supported its independence.

In the midst of this parliamentary instability and divisions of the political class, Charles de Gaulle took advantage of the May 1958 crisis to return to power. On 13 May, European colonists seized the Governor-General&#x27;s building in Algiers while Opération Résurrection was launched by the right-wing insurrectionary &quot;Comité de Salut Public&quot;. De Gaulle, who had deserted the political arena for a decade by disgust over the parliamentary system and its chronic instability (the &quot;système des partis&quot; which he severely criticized), now appeared as the only man able to reconcile the far-right and the European settlers, which were threatening a coup d&#x27;état, with the French Republic. Thus, he was called to power and proclaimed the end of the Fourth Republic (according to him too weak because of its parliamentarism) and replaced it by the Fifth Republic, a hybrid presidential-parliamentary system tailored for himself.

The Radical Party supported de Gaulle at this crucial moment, leading Mendès-France to quit the party. Opposed to the proposed constitution, Mendès-France campaigned for the &quot;no&quot; on 28 September 1958 referendum. However, the new Constitution was finally adopted and proclaimed on 4 October 1958.

=== Fifth Republic (1958–present) ===
Popular figure Pierre Mendès-France quit the Radical Party, which had crossed the threshold to the centre-right, as early moderate Republicans did at the beginning of the Third Republic, when the Radical Party, appearing to their left, pushed them over the border between the left-wing and the right-wing, a process dubbed &quot;sinistrisme&quot;.

Mendès-France then founded the &quot;Centre d&#x27;Action Démocratique&quot; (CAD), which would later join the Autonomous Socialist Party (PSA, which had split from the SFIO), which in turn fused into the Unified Socialist Party (PSU) on 3 April 1960. This new socialist party gathered all the dissidents from the Radical Party and the SFIO who were opposed to both the Algerian War and the proclamation of the new presidential regime. Mendès-France would officially become a member of the PSU in 1961, a year before the 18 March 1962 Evian Accords which put an end to the Algerian War.

The Radical Party returned from support of the government to opposition in 1959 and declined throughout all the 1960s. Allied with the SFIO in the Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left, it supported François Mitterrand for the 1965 presidential election. This federation later split in 1968.

Under the leadership of Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, President since 29 October 1969 issued from the left-wing, the party again made tentative moves to the left in the 1970s, but stopped short of an alliance with Socialist Party (PS) leader François Mitterrand and his Communist allies, leading to a final split in 1972 when the remaining centre-left Radicals left the party and eventually became the Movement of the Radical-Socialist Left. This group, which wanted to be a part of the left-wing Common Programme, broke away to create the Movement of the Left Radicals (MRG) and at the 1974 presidential election, supported Mitterrand, the candidate of the left-wing.

==== Radical Party &quot;valoisien&quot; ====
Henceforth, the Radical Party began to be known as &quot;valoisien&quot;, from the location of its national headquarters at the Place de Valois in Paris, in order to distinguish it from the MRG. Opposed to an electoral alliance with the PCF, which was the foundation of the 1972 &quot;Common Programme&quot;, the Radicals were still anti-Gaullists. They allied with the Christian Democrats in the Reforming Movement in order to propose another way between the Common Programme&#x27;s parties and the Presidential Majority led by Gaullists. Finally, they joined it after the election of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing to the presidency of France in 1974. They supported most reforms of Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s presidency (in particular the authorization of the contraceptive pill and recognition of women&#x27;s rights). This evolution brought by Servan-Schreiber&#x27;s influence would end with the latter&#x27;s failure during the 1979 European elections.

Following the left-wing scission in 1971, the Radical Party &quot;valoisien&quot; maintained the judicial rights to the official name of Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party and is its legal continuation.

After the failure of the alliance with the Christians Democrats into the Reforming Movement, the Radical Party maintained its influence by participating in the foundation of Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s Union for French Democracy (UDF) in 1978. The Radical Party was one of its six components, along with the centrists of the Centre of Social Democrats, the liberals of the Republican Party and of the National Federation of Perspectives and Realities Clubs, the social democrats of the Socialist-Democratic Movement and of the new members of the UDF. Through the UDF, the Radical Party participated to all of the governments issued from parliamentary majorities of the Rally for the Republic (RPR).

==== Associate party of the UMP ====
An important split took place after the 1998 regional elections, during which some members of the party composed electoral alliances with the far-right National Front party. Those members created the Liberal Democratic Party while the Radical Party remained a member of the UDF. During the 2002 presidential election, François Bayrou presented himself as a candidate for the UDF while the Radical Party supported his rival Jacques Chirac (RPR).

After Chirac&#x27;s re-election in 2002, most radicals participated to the creation of his new party, the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The Radical Party then quit the UDF to associate itself with the UMP, sharing its memberships and budget with the latter. However, some members such as Thierry Cornillet continue to be part of UDF. It was then headed by Jean-Louis Borloo and André Rossinot.

After the rise of Nicolas Sarkozy to the leadership of the UMP, Radicals launched a sort of re-foundation of their party in order to create a counterbalancing moderate and social wing within the UMP. The party soon started to attract other centrists (as Jean-Louis Borloo, Renaud Dutreil, Véronique Mathieu and Françoise Hostalier) and even some anti-Sarkozy neo-Gaullists (as Serge Lepeltier and Alain Ferry). As a result, the Radical Party had a comeback in French politics. It then had 21 deputies (four more from those elected in 2002), 6 senators (two more from 2002), 4 MEPs and 8,000 members. Jean-Louis Borloo was a high-ranking minister in François Fillon&#x27;s second government as Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and Transport and Minister of State from 2007 to 2010, when he chose not take part to Fillon&#x27;s third government. It was the first time since 1974 that Radicals were not represented in a centre-right government.

During the 7th term of the European Parliament, three Radical MEPs sat with the European People&#x27;s Party Group (EPP) along with the UMP.

==== The Alliance ====

On 7 April 2011, Borloo announced the creation of a centrist coalition. During a party congress on 14–15 May, the Radicals decided to cut their ties with Sarkozy&#x27;s Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), of which they had been an associate party since 2002. During a convention on 26 June, the party officially joined The Alliance (ARES) alongside New Centre and other centrist parties as an alternative to the UMP. The Alliance was replaced with the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) in September 2012.

During the 8th European Parliament, the single Radical MEP Dominique Riquet sat with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) group as part of the UDI.

<text>Tatamagouche (Mi&#x27;kmaq: &quot;Taqamiju’jk&quot;) is a village in Colchester County, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Tatamagouche is situated on the Northumberland Strait 50 kilometres north of Truro and 50 kilometres west of Pictou. The village is located along the south side of Tatamagouche Bay at the mouths of the French and Waugh Rivers. Tatamagouche derives its name from the native Mi&#x27;kmaq term &quot;Takǔmegoochk&quot;, translated as &quot;Meeting of the waters&quot;.

==Early history==

The first European settlers in the Tatamagouche area were the French Acadians, who settled the area in the early 18th century, and Tatamagouche became a transshipment point for goods bound for Fortress of Louisbourg.

=== Battle at Tatamagouche ===

During King George&#x27;s War, New England was engaged in the Siege of Louisbourg (1745) in their efforts to defeat the French. On June 15, 1745, Captain Donahew confronted Lieut. Paul Marin de la Malgue&#x27;s allied force who was en route from Annapolis Royal to Louisbourg. The French convoy of two sloops and two schooners and many natives in a large number of canoes was a relief effort of French and Mi&#x27;kmaq on their way to the fortress. Donahew drove the French ashore, preventing supplies and reinforcements from reaching Louisbourg before it fell to the English. The British reported there was a &quot;considerable slaughter&quot; of the French and natives. The battle was significant in the downfall of Louisbourg because Marin&#x27;s relief envoy was thwarted.

=== Expulsion of the Acadians ===
The homes of the Acadians who lived in the village were burned as part of the Bay of Fundy Campaign (1755) during the French and Indian War. Tatamagouche and nearby Wallace, Nova Scotia were the first villages in Acadia to be burned because they were the gateway through which Acadians supplied the French Fortress Louisbourg.

All that remains from that period are Acadian dykes and some French place names.

Fort Franklin was built at Tatamagouche in 1768, named after Michael Francklin. (The fort was built immediately after the abandonment of both Fort Ellis (Nova Scotia) and Fort Belcher.)

=== Protestant settlement ===
Ten years later, on August 25, 1765, the land that became Tatamagouche was given to British military mapmaker Colonel Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres by the British Crown. DesBarres was awarded 20,000 acres (81 km2) of land in and around Tatamagouche on the condition that he settle it with 100 Protestants within 10 years. Low land prices in other colonies made attracting tenants difficult, but an offer of six years free rent to dissatisfied residents of Lunenburg was a moderate success in 1772.

The earliest settlers of Tatamagouche from Lunenburg were families from Montbéliard on the French-German border near Switzerland. To escape religious persecution following the Edict of Fontainebleau, these families boarded rafts and drifted down the Rhine to Rotterdam. There the Scottish merchant John Dick was recruiting colonists and shipping them across the English Channel to be transported to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Those who survived the Atlantic crossing in 1752 and a difficult winter in Halifax had been taken to Lunenburg in 1753. These French-speaking Lutherans were often identified as Swiss in early census records to distinguish them from the Acadian French Catholics. Their French names have often been Anglicized as shown in parentheses. The earliest families included those headed by James Biguenet (Bigney), George Gretteau (Gratto), George Mettetal (Matatall), George Tetteray (Tattrie), John and Peter Maillard (Millard), John George and John Frederick Petrequin (Patriquin) and David, James and Matthew Langille.

Protestant repopulation also grew considerably before the end of the century with a flood of Scottish immigrants following the Highland Clearances.

During the American Revolution, American privateers pillaged the property of Wellwood Waugh and he was forced to move from Charlottetown to Pictou, Nova Scotia, the following year. In 1777, Waugh was himself implicated in an American privateer raid on Pictou and was forced to move to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia. He became a prominent inhabitant and Waugh River is named after him.
== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Tatamagouche had a population of 691 living in 348 of its 387 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 755. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Climate==

==Ship building and lumbering==
In the 19th century, like many other villages in the area, Tatamagouche had a sizable shipbuilding industry. Trees were plentiful and sawmills started appearing on area rivers, producing lumber for settlers. Builders needed the lumber to produce the ships and it was common to send a completed vessel overseas loaded with lumber.

Generally, there were five types of vessels being built at Tatamagouche: the schooner, brig, brigantine, barque, and clipper ship. Of these, schooners were by far the most popular. There is also one barquentine on record as being built at Tatamagouche, the Yolande in 1883.

Many of the larger vessels, such as the brigs, barques and brigantines, were loaded with lumber from the area and sailed to Britain, where first the cargo, and then the ship itself, were sold. Some of the ships sold immediately, while others could take years to find a buyer. Often, the owner would sail the ship over to arrange for its sale personally, other times they would be sold through a firm such as Cannon, Miller, &amp; Co., who sold most of the Campbell brothers ships.

The age of steam ended ship building in Tatamagouche.

===The Campbell Brothers===
On May 17, 1824, Alexander Campbell and partners William Mortimer and G. Smith launched their first ship on the French river, a schooner named Elizabeth. They launched several more ships together, until Alexander went into partnership with his brothers, William and James, in 1830. Their partnership ended in 1833 following a disagreement between Alexander and James. The brothers went their separate ways, each building ships for some time afterwards, but the list of ships built in Tatamagouche shows Alexander Campbell to be the most active of the three, with over 70 ships to his name.

William built about a dozen ships after the breakup that varied in quality, size and type. Several of them were loaded with timber bound for the British Isles. His last ship was the Trident and in 1842 she ran aground off Newfoundland on her maiden voyage, leaving him near bankruptcy. He died a poor man in 1878, despite having held several other jobs.

When William stopped building, Alexander took over his yard and attacked the market in full force. At the height of the ship building days he employed about 200 men. In 1850 he turned out eight ships.

==Railroad==

The Intercolonial Railway constructed its &quot;Short Line&quot; from Oxford Junction to Stellarton through Tatamagouche in 1887. The ICR commissioned the Rhodes Curry Company of Amherst to build a passenger station in the village immediately east of the creamery. The ICR was merged into the Canadian National Railways in 1918 and CN operated this line as part of its &quot;Oxford Subdivision&quot;, servicing mainly agricultural communities, as well as the salt mines at Malagash and Pugwash as well as a quarry in Wallace. Passenger service through Tatamagouche was discontinued in the 1960s and the station was used as an office for railway employees handling freight until 1972 when it was closed and sold in 1976. CN discontinued freight service on the line in 1986 when the Oxford Sub was abandoned; the rails were removed in 1989.

Today the passenger station is a bed and breakfast with restored historic rail cars located on the property. The rail line through the village is a recreational trail, designated as part of the Trans Canada Trail and the point where the Nova Scotia portion of the trail branches south to Truro, Halifax and southwestern Nova Scotia, making Tatamagouche a good starting point for a short waterfront walk or a major biking expedition.

==Landmarks and attractions==
* One of the more famous landmarks in the village is the Tatamagouche Creamery, begun by Alexander Ross in 1925. Over 1000 local farms supplied milk to the Creamery in order to produce its famous Tatamagouche Butter, which it did daily, making almost . In 1930, J.J. Creighton purchased the Creamery. After his death in 1967, Scotsburn Dairy Cooperative acquired it. Scotsburn kept the Creamery operational from 1968 until they closed its doors in 1992. The lot and two buildings were donated to the village with the stipulation that no structural changes were to be made to the building&#x27;s exterior, including the name and colour. However, a community cannot hold a deed, so the Creamery Society, a community-based organization, was formed to take over the building. The Creamery Square Association was formed to develop the Creamery Square project. A new Farmers&#x27; Market building opened in May 2006, and the Creamery building is now home to The North Shore Archives and the Giantess Anna Swan Museum. The Brule Fossil Centre was eventually moved to form its own exhibit in the Creamery building. 
* The principal historical museum in the area for many years was the Sunrise Trail Museum, but the building has been sold and exhibits have been moved to the Creamery Square complex.
*The Barrachois Harbour Yacht Club at Sunrise Shore Marina just east of Tatamagouche offers excellent cruising and racing programs as well as online resources for powerboats and sailing vessels. 
* The Fraser Cultural Centre acts as a visitor information centre, art gallery, and has an exhibition about the &quot;Nova Scotia Giantess&quot; Anna Swan.
* On the last weekend of September each year, the Bavarian Society of Tatamagouche hosts the second largest Oktoberfest in Canada.
* The Sutherland Steam Mill Museum is in the nearby village of Denmark.
* Dorje Denma Ling, a retreat centre in the Shambhala Buddhist tradition in The Falls (10 km south of the village) attracts visitors from around the world.
* The Tatamagouche Centre is an accredited, non-profit education, conference and retreat centre of the United Church of Canada.
* The Fraser Octagon House is a Provincially Registered Property under the Heritage Property Act of Nova Scotia, noted for its nearly octagonal plan.

==Notable people==
Ron Joyce, Canadian entrepreneur, billionaire and co-founder of Tim Hortons was born in 1930 in Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia.

==Events==
In September 2008, Paperny Films of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada selected Tatamagouche as the venue for the second (and last) season of &quot;The Week the Women Went&quot;. The episodes aired on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), starting on January 21, 2009.

<text>Frank Frazetta (born Frank Frazzetta ; February 9, 1928 – May 10, 2010) was an American artist known for themes of fantasy and science fiction, noted for comic books, paperback book covers, paintings, posters, LP record album covers, and other media. He is often referred to as the &quot;Godfather of fantasy art&quot;, and one of the most renowned illustrators of the 20th century. He was also the subject of a 2003 documentary &quot;Painting with Fire&quot;.

Frazetta was inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame, the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame, the Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame, the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, and was awarded a Life Achievement Award from the World Fantasy Convention.

==Early life==
Born Frank Frazzetta in Sheepshead Bay, New York, located in Brooklyn. Frazetta removed one &quot;z&quot; from his last name early in his career to make his name seem less &quot;clumsy&quot;. The only boy in a family with three sisters, he spent much time with his grandmother, who began encouraging him in art when he was two years old. In 2010, a month before his death, he recalled that:
At age eight, Frazetta attended the Brooklyn Academy of Fine Arts, a small art school run by Italian instructor Michele Falanga. &quot;[H]e didn&#x27;t teach me anything, really,&quot; Frazetta said in 1994. &quot;He&#x27;d come and see where I was working, and he might say, &#x27;Very nice, very nice. But perhaps if you did this or that.&#x27; But that&#x27;s about it. We never had any great conversations. He spoke very broken English. He kind of left you on your own. I learned more from my friends there.&quot;

==Career==
===Early work===
In 1944, at age 16, Frazetta, who had &quot;always had this urge to be doing comic books&quot;, began working in comics artist Bernard Baily&#x27;s studio doing pencil clean-ups. His first comic-book work was inking the eight-page story &quot;Snowman&quot;, penciled by John Giunta, in the one-shot &quot;Tally-Ho Comics&quot; (Dec. 1944), published by Swappers Quarterly and Almanac/Baily Publishing Company. It was not standard practice in comic books during this period to provide complete credits, so a comprehensive listing of Frazetta&#x27;s work is difficult to ascertain. His next confirmed comics works are two signed penciled-and-inked pieces in Prize Comics&#x27; &quot;Treasure Comics&quot; #7 (July 1946): the four-page &quot;Know your America&quot; is Frank Frazetta&#x27;s first &quot;solo&quot; work, and the single page &quot;Ahoy! Enemy Ship!&quot;, featuring his character Capt. Kidd Jr. In a 1991 interview in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, Frazetta credited Graham Ingels as the first one in the comic book industry to recognize his talent, and to give him jobs at Standard Comics in 1947.

For Dell&#x27;s &quot;Famous Funnies&quot;, Frazetta did war and human interest stories for &quot;Heroic Comics&quot;, as well as one pagers extolling the virtues of prayer and the evils of drug abuse. In comics like &quot;Personal Love&quot; and &quot;Movie Love&quot;, he did romance and celebrity stories.

From 1952 to 1953 he drew the newspaper comic strip &quot;Johnny Comet&quot; for the McNaught Syndicate; despite a name change to &quot;Ace McCoy&quot; in the middle of its run the strip was canceled after a year. In 1954 Frazetta was hired as a member of Al Capp&#x27;s studio; his primary job was to pencil the &quot;L&#x27;il Abner&quot; Sunday page, but he also drew a variety of advertising and editorial art featuring L&#x27;il Abner&#x27;s characters.

He married Massachusetts native Eleanor Kelly in New York City in November 1956. The two had four children: Frank Jr., Billy, Holly, and Heidi.

In 1961, after seven years with Al Capp, Frazetta tried to return to comic books but was unsuccessful. He was given some inking work by his friend George Evans before deciding to pursue a career in illustration (though he briefly helped Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder on three stories of the bawdy parody strip &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot; in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine). 

===Hollywood and book covers===

In 1964, Frazetta&#x27;s painting of Beatle Ringo Starr for a &quot;Mad&quot; magazine ad parody caught the eye of United Artists studios. He was approached to do the film poster for &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?,&quot; and earned the equivalent of his yearly salary in one afternoon. He did several other film posters.

Frazetta also produced paintings for mass market paperback editions of adventure books. His interpretation of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Conan the Barbarian visually redefined the genre of sword and sorcery, and had an enormous influence on succeeding generations of artists. His cover art only coincidentally matched the storylines inside the books, as Frazetta once explained: &quot;I didn&#x27;t read any of it... I drew him my way. It was really rugged. And it caught on. I didn&#x27;t care about what people thought. People who bought the books never complained about it. They probably didn&#x27;t read them.&quot;

Primarily, these were in oil, but he also worked in watercolor, ink, and pencil alone. Frazetta&#x27;s work in comics during this time were cover paintings and a few comic stories in black-and-white for the Warren Publishing horror and war magazines &quot;Creepy&quot;, &quot;Eerie&quot;, &quot;Blazing Combat&quot;, and &quot;Vampirella&quot;.

An advertisement for Jōvan Musk, based on his work, was animated by Richard Williams in grease pencil and paint and shown in 1978. The realism of the animation and design replicated Frazetta&#x27;s artwork. Frazetta and Ralph Bakshi were heavily involved in the production of the live-action sequences used for the film &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;&#x27;s rotoscoped animation, from casting sessions to the final shoot. The film was Frazetta&#x27;s only work in animation, following its release he returned to his roots in painting and pen-and-ink illustrations.

Frazetta&#x27;s paintings have been used by a number of recording artists as cover art for their albums. The U.S. Army III Corps adopted &quot;The Death Dealer&quot; as its mascot.

In 2009 Kirk Hammett, the lead guitarist for Metallica, bought Frazetta&#x27;s cover artwork for the paperback reissue of Robert E. Howard&#x27;s &quot;Conan the Conqueror&quot; for $1 million.

===Later life and career===
In the early 1980s, Frazetta created a gallery, Frazetta&#x27;s Fantasy Corner, on the upper floors of a former Masonic building at the corner of South Courtland and Washington streets in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. The building also housed a Frazetta art museum that displayed both his own work and, in a separate gallery, that of other artists. From 1998 to 1999, Quantum Cat Entertainment published the magazine &quot;Frank Frazetta Fantasy Illustrated&quot;, with cover art and some illustrations by Frazetta. In his later life, Frazetta was plagued by a variety of health problems, including a thyroid condition that went untreated for many years. A series of strokes left his right arm almost completely paralyzed. He taught himself to paint and draw with his left hand. He was the subject of the 2003 feature film documentary &quot;Frank Frazetta: Painting With Fire&quot;.

By 2009, Frazetta was living on a estate in the Pocono Mountains in Northeastern Pennsylvania, with a small museum that is open to the public. On July 17, 2009, his wife and business partner, Eleanor &quot;Ellie&quot; Frazetta, died after a year-long battle with cancer. He then hired Rob Pistella and Steve Ferzoco to handle his business affairs.

Shortly after Ellie Frazetta&#x27;s death in December 2009, Frank Frazetta&#x27;s eldest son Frank Jr. was arrested on charges of stealing $20 million in paintings from the family museum in a fight over the family fortune. According to the police report, Frazetta Jr, with the help of two men, broke through the museum door using a backhoe and took about 90 paintings. According to the affidavit, Frank Jr. told the responding trooper he had permission from the owner, Frank Frazetta Sr. The trooper called the owner, who said he had not given his son permission to either be in the museum or remove paintings from it.

At issue was whether Frank Jr. believed he had the authority to remove the paintings from the Frazetta museum. Frazetta Sr.&#x27;s youngest son Bill Frazetta testified that the paintings belonged to a corporation called Frazetta Properties LLC, of which he shared management duties with his sisters. &quot;I am a manager of the LLC. The art was supposed to stay in the museum&quot;, Bill Frazetta said. Frank Jr. maintained that he was trying to prevent the paintings from being sold, per the wishes of his father, who he said had given him power of attorney over his estate. Frank Sr. said he did not understand his son&#x27;s actions. The Frazetta family later issued a statement on April 23, 2010, that said, &quot;all of the litigation surrounding his family and his art has been resolved. All of Frank&#x27;s children will now be working together as a team to promote his ... collection of images...&quot;.

Frank Frazetta died of a stroke on May 10, 2010, in a hospital near his residence in Florida.

==Accolades==
Frazetta was inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1995, the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999. and The Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2001, he was awarded a Life Achievement Award from the World Fantasy Convention. And in 2014, Frazetta was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame, and in 2016 into the Album Cover Hall of Fame. In 2023, Frazetta was inducted into the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame.

==Legacy==

Frazetta has influenced many artists within the genres of fantasy and science fiction. Filmmaker and creator of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, George Lucas mentions Frazetta&#x27;s work in a 1979 article by Alan Arnold stating &quot;I&#x27;m a fan of comic art. I collect it. ...There are quite a few [contemporary] illustrators in the science-fiction and science-fantasy modes I like very much. I like them because their designs and imaginations are so vivid. Illustrators like Frazetta, Druillet, and Moebius are quite sophisticated in their style&quot;. In 2018, Los Angeles&#x27; Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, which is scheduled to complete construction in late 2021, announced it would display four Frazetta originals from Lucas&#x27; personal Frazetta collection.

Oscar-nominated filmmaker Guillermo del Toro said in a 2010 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article that Frazetta was nothing less than &quot;an Olympian artist that defined fantasy art for the 20th century.&quot; Del Toro went on to say &quot;He gave the world a new pantheon of heroes... He somehow created a second narrative layer for every book he ever illustrated.&quot;

Fantasy artist and musician Joseph Vargo cites Frazetta as a primary influence, and his art calendars since 1998 mark Frazetta&#x27;s birthday. Chris Perna, art director at Epic Games, stated in an interview in 2011 that Frazetta was one of his influences. Other artists influenced by Frazetta include comics artist such as Marc Silvestri and Shelby Robertson.

Photographer Mark Seliger credits Frazetta for the inspiration of his 2000 portrait photo of Jennifer Lopez.

The face and body paint of professional wrestler Kamala was copied by artist and wrestler Jerry Lawler from a character in a Frazetta painting.

In early 2012, filmmaker Robert Rodriguez announced plans to remake Bakshi and Frazetta&#x27;s film &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;. Sony Pictures acquired the project in late 2014, with Rodriguez set to direct. In 2013, Robert Rodriguez displayed Frank Frazetta&#x27;s original artworks, on loan from the collections of Holly, Heidi, and Bill Frazetta at the Wizard World Comic Con in Chicago. Robert Rodriguez continued his Frazetta artwork tour by showcasing them at the SXSW event in Austin, Texas, in both 2014 and 2015.

Reopened solely by Frank Jr in 2013, the Frazetta Art Museum in East Stroudsburg houses roughly 37 original oils, as well as other pencil, pen and ink, and watercolor works.

As of 2013, Holly Frazetta&#x27;s collection was traveling throughout the U.S. with public showings at comics conventions. She also co-founded Frazetta Girls alongside daughter Sara Frazetta in 2014. The Frazetta Girls company operates as a web store for official Frank Frazetta merchandise, and has a large social media presence for daily postings of Frazetta&#x27;s work. Since 2014, Frazetta Girls has also collaborated with modern influential brands such as Primitive Skateboarding, Kid Robot, HUF Worldwide, and Mezco Toyz. In March 2020, Holly Frazetta announced the reopening of the Frazetta Art Museum location in Boca Grande, Florida, by appointment only, featuring original Conan the Barbarian and Death Dealer works. In February 2022 in collaboration with Incendium Online&#x27;s Opus Publishing arm, the Frazetta Girls announced &quot;Frank Frazetta&#x27;s Death Dealer&quot; comic series would return, with Issue #1 released worldwide May 10, 2022, spawning the beginning of the FrazettaVerse.

Frazetta&#x27;s painting &quot;Egyptian Queen&quot; sold for $5.4 million (£4.2m) on May 16, 2019, at a public auction of vintage comic books and comic art held by Heritage Auctions in Chicago, Illinois, which set a new world record for comic art. On June 27, 2023, Frazetta&#x27;s &quot;Dark Kingdom&quot; (1976) was sold for 6 million U.S. dollars through Heritage Auctions, setting a new record for a Frazetta painting and for any fantasy art.

<text>Stoke Hammond (Old English: &quot;Stoche Hamon&quot;) is a historical English village and civil parish in the north of the county of Buckinghamshire. It is one of the 53 &quot;thankful villages&quot; which lost no men in World War I, as first identified by the writer Arthur Mee in the 1930s, and is the only thankful village in Buckinghamshire. The parish extends over 600 hectares and has a population of approximately 2000.

The nearest train station is in Leighton Buzzard, offering fast trains both north and south to Milton Keynes and London Euston. The Grand Union Canal also passes close by. Until 2007, the A4146 ran through Stoke Hammond until the bypass opened, making the village peaceful once again.

Notable residents of Stoke Hammond include David F. Kessler, former managing director of &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, as well as various individuals with connections to Queen Victoria and the early Disney family.

== Village History ==
The settlement of Stoke Hammond can be traced back to well before the Norman Conquest, largely due to its access to a reliable water supply, notably at &quot;Chaddle&quot; (now Chadwell), located near the edge of Whaddon Chase forest.

The village was first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Stoche&quot;: a common place name in England denoting an Anglo-Saxon church or place of worship. The suffix Hammond was added later in manorial, referring to the &quot;Hamon&quot; family who owned the estate at the time of the Domesday survey. Stoke Manor was owned by Hamon Brito, son of Mainfelin Brito, in the 12th century. The manor later passed into the ownership of the Duke of Norfolk, with the family retaining possession into the Victorian era.

Over time, the village developed around five key farmhouses: Mount Pleasant, Tyrells, Grove, Moat, and Bridge. The Bridge farmhouse was once owned by Queen Victoria and remains a notable historic building. It justifiably deserves its conservation status and continued to be surrounded by working farmland.

== St Luke&#x27;s Church ==
The parish church of Stoke Hammond is dedicated to St Luke, one of the four Evangelists of Christianity. 1,000 years ago a few inhabitants of &quot;Stoche&quot; built a church, and this has been an integral part of the community ever since. The earliest surviving part of the St Luke&#x27;s Church was built by the Saxons, part of which can be seen at the eastern end of the south wall of the chancel.

The first recorded rector of Stoke Hammond was Richard de Tinton in 1220, who held this position until the reign of Henry III. By 1350, the church had adopted its present cruciform layout, with the chancel, central tower, and transepts being added during that period. The oldest bell in the church dates back to 1370. The church has had rectors who went on to become bishops, including Steven de Gravesend, who became Bishop of London in 1318.

In the 1920s, a violent thunderstorm struck the church, and a &quot;ball of fire&quot; shattered the east window and several others. In the aftermath, the present window was designed, depicting St Luke alongside a scene representing the village.

A detailed history of the church can be found in &quot;A Thousand Years&quot;, by author Pamela Murphy, available inside the church.

There is also a Methodist Chapel built in 1927 which is no longer in use.

== Tyrell&#x27;s Manor ==
For over 600 years, Tyrell&#x27;s Manor passed through the female line, often as the dowry of heiresses. The name was changed to Ingletons on the passing again by dowry, to Geoffrey Ingleton in 1465, and when their daughter married Humphrey Tyrell, who came from a noble family and was an ancestor of the famous hanging Judge, Tyrell, the estate took its present name.

The present house, built in 1708, had thirty-six windows, that were blocked up before the penal window taxes of a few years later. Built to the four points of the compass, this typical Queen Anne style architecture embodied all the fine craftsmanship of the time. The walls are 18 inches thick, oak beams 20 foot long and nearly 2 feet square throughout their length. The original wattle and daub plaster that has stood the test of time for over 250 years. It was built on the site of a previous house and the cellars are hundreds of years older than the existing building.

In the 1960s, an &quot;Angus Dei&quot; shield was found in a corner of the ancient cellar, which the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum placed as late as the 14th century, likely part of the decoration of an earlier edition of the manor. This shield can be seen now on the window sill to the left of the altar in St Luke&#x27;s church, and is where the village gets its shield emblem from.

== The Dolphin Pub ==
&quot;The Dolphin&quot; pub in Stoke Hammond has a rich history. The earliest reference to the building dates back to 1695, with a conveyance mentioning two cottages. A later conveyance from 1823 refers to a cottage known as &quot;The Dolphin&quot; and a blacksmith&#x27;s shop. The name is thought to have been chosen by a former ship&#x27;s blacksmith who wanted to retain a connection to his maritime roots. The pub officially became a traditional public house in 1920.

After the COVID-19 pandemic, The Dolphin underwent extensive renovations and extensions, transforming into an award-winning restaurant and bar while retaining its traditional oak-framed charm.

== RAF Stoke Hammond ==
RAF Stoke Hammond operated as a secret wireless station from 1943 to 1973, providing vital communications support for Bletchley Park in World War II and RAF Stanbridge during the subsequent Cold War. The station has since been decommissioned and is now private property.

<doc id="387780" wikidata="Q177115" url="?curid=387780" title="Ploughman's lunch">
<text>A ploughman&#x27;s lunch is an originally British cold meal based around bread, cheese, and fresh or pickled onions. Additional items can be added, such as ham, green salad, hard boiled eggs, and apple, and usual accompaniments are butter and a sweet pickle such as Branston. As its name suggests, it is most commonly eaten at lunchtime. It is particularly associated with pubs, and often served with beer; the saltiness of the cheese was noted to enhance the &quot;relish of the beer.&quot;

Beer, bread, and cheese have been combined in the British diet since antiquity, and have been served together in inns for centuries. However, the specific term &quot;ploughman&#x27;s lunch&quot; is believed to date from the 1950s, when the Cheese Bureau, a marketing body, began promoting it in pubs as a way to increase the sales of cheese, which had recently ceased to be rationed. Its popularity increased as the Milk Marketing Board promoted the meal nationally throughout the 1960s.

==History==
Bread and cheese formed the basis of the diet of English rural labourers for centuries: skimmed-milk cheese, supplemented with small amounts of lard and/or butter, was their main source of fats and protein. In the absence of access to expensive seasonings, onions were the &quot;favoured condiment&quot;, as well as providing a valuable source of vitamin C.

The reliance on cheese rather than meat protein was especially strong in the south of the country. As late as the 1870s, farmworkers in Devon were said to eat &quot;bread and hard cheese at 2d. a pound, with cider very washy and sour&quot; for their midday meal. While this diet was associated with rural poverty, it also gained associations with more idealised images of rural life. Anthony Trollope in &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Children&quot; has a character comment that &quot;A rural labourer who sits on the ditch-side with his bread and cheese and an onion has more enjoyment out of it than any Lucullus&quot;.

While farm labourers usually carried their food with them to eat in the fields, similar food was for a long time served in public houses as a simple, inexpensive meal. In 1815, William Cobbett recalled how farmers going to market in Farnham, forty years earlier, would often add &quot;2d. worth of bread and cheese&quot; to the pint of beer they drank at the inn stabling their horses. In the 19th century the English fondness for serving cheese and bread with beer was noted, as &quot;the very dryness and saltness heighten thirst, and therefore the relish of the beer&quot;. In the early 20th century, bread and cheese was still the only food available in many rural pubs: in 1932 Martin Armstrong described stopping at village inns for a lunch of bread, cheese and beer, noting that &quot;On these occasions in country inns when bread, cheese and beer seem so extraordinarily good, the alternative is generally nothing; and compared with nothing bread, cheese, and beer are beyond compare&quot;.

While &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; states the first recorded use of the phrase &quot;ploughman&#x27;s luncheon&quot; occurred in 1837, from the &quot;Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott&quot; by John G. Lockhart, this stray early use may have meant merely the sum of its parts, &quot;a lunch for a ploughman&quot;. The &quot;OED&quot;″s next reference is from the July 1956 &quot;Monthly Bulletin&quot; of the Brewers&#x27; Society, which describes the activities of the Cheese Bureau, a marketing body affiliated with the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency. It describes how the Bureau

By the 1950s, the traditional combination of bread, cheese, beer and onions was certainly being referred to by forms of the name later used to promote it. In 1956, author Adrian Bell reported: &quot;There&#x27;s a pub quite close to where I live where ... all you need say is, &#x27;Ploughboy&#x27;s Lunch, Harry, please&#x27;. And in a matter of minutes a tray is handed across the counter to you on which is a good square hunk of bread, a lump of butter and a wedge of cheese, and pickled onions, along with your pint of beer&quot;. Only a year later, in June 1957, another edition of the &quot;Monthly Bulletin&quot; of the Brewers&#x27; Society referred to a ploughman&#x27;s lunch using that name, and said that it consisted of &quot;cottage bread, cheese, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, cold sausages and, of course, beer&quot;. The Glasgow newspaper &quot;The Bulletin&quot; from 15 April 1958 and &quot;The Times&quot; from 29 April 1958 refer to a ploughman&#x27;s lunch consisting of bread, cheese and pickled onions.

The meal rose rapidly in popularity during the 1970s. This has been argued to be at least partially based on a British cultural &quot;revulsion from technology and modernity and a renewed love-affair with an idealised national past&quot;, although it appears the main reasons the ploughman&#x27;s lunch was favoured by caterers were that it was simple and quick to prepare even for less skilled staff, required no cooking, and involved no meat, giving a potential for high profit margins.

The film &quot;The Ploughman&#x27;s Lunch&quot; (1983), from a screenplay by Ian McEwan, has a subtext that is &quot;the way countries and people re-write their own history to suit the needs of the present&quot;. The title alludes to the debatable claim that the supposedly &quot;traditional&quot; meal was the result of a marketing campaign of the 1960s devised to encourage people to eat meals in pubs.

In 2023, &quot;Bon Appétit&quot; described &quot;girl dinner&quot; as a rebrand of meals based on bread and cheese, such as the ploughman&#x27;s lunch.

<text>Wedding (, ) is a locality in the borough of Mitte, Berlin, Germany. It was a separate borough in the north-western inner city until it was fused with Tiergarten and Mitte in Berlin&#x27;s 2001 administrative reform. At the same time the eastern half of the former borough of Wedding—on the other side of Reinickendorfer Straße—was separated as the new locality of Gesundbrunnen.

==History==
In the 12th century, the manor of the nobleman Rudolf de Weddinge was located on the small Panke River in the immediate vicinity of today&#x27;s Nettelbeckplatz. The farmstead, which burned down more than once, remained abandoned in the forest until the 18th century. In the mid-18th century, while Gesundbrunnen was being built up as a health resort and spa town, gambling and prostitution moved into Wedding, transforming it into a pleasure district. In 1864, Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering established the Schering pharmaceutical company on Müllerstraße; the company has been a part of Bayer since 2006. A large hospital at the western rim of the locality was built between 1898 and 1906 on the initiative of Rudolf Virchow. The Rotaprint plant was initiated in Wedding in 1904 and became one of the largest employers locally with about 1,000 staff at its height.

The constant migration of country-dwellers into the city at the end of the 19th century converted Wedding into a working-class district. The labourers lived in cramped tenement blocks, many in the Wilhelmine Ring. After World War I, Wedding was known as &quot;Red Wedding&quot; as it was renowned for its militant, largely Communist working class; it was the scene of violent clashes between paramilitary groups such as the KPD&#x27;s Roter Frontkämpferbund and the Nazi Party&#x27;s Sturmabteilung in the late 1920s, including the Blutmai riots of 1929 in which the Social Democratic–controlled Berlin Police killed 33 Communists.

After World War II, Wedding and Reinickendorf together made up the French sector of Berlin. The buildings on the north side of Wedding&#x27;s Bernauer Straße and the street, including sidewalks, were in the French sector, while the buildings along the southern side were in Soviet territory. When the Berlin Wall was being built in August 1961, many who lived in these buildings frantically jumped from their windows before the buildings could be evacuated and their windows bricked up.

Wedding was also the western terminus of one of the first refugee tunnels dug underneath the Berlin Wall. It extended from the basement of an abandoned factory on Schönholzer Straße in the Soviet sector underneath Bernauer Straße to another building in the west. Though marvelously well constructed and kept secret, the tunnel was plagued by water from leaking pipes, and had to be shut down after only a few days of operation.

A section of the wall has been reconstructed near the spot on Bernauer Straße (since 2001 part of the locality of Gesundbrunnen) where the tunnel ended. Two sections of wall run parallel to one another down the street with a &quot;death strip&quot; in the middle. A nearby museum documents the history of the wall.

==Wedding today==

Today, Wedding is one of the poorest areas of Berlin, with a high unemployment rate (almost 26%). Almost 17% of the population live on social welfare; 27% live below the poverty line. Foreigners make up 30% of the population. Low rental costs accompany the poverty in Wedding. Therefore, like many inexpensive areas in large cities, it is home to a vibrant artists&#x27; community. Many galleries have been founded by artists to provide a space for themselves and their peers to showcase their works. The statistics used here are long out of date and need updating. 

Wedding has so far not experienced the boom and development of the 1990s in post-reunification Berlin. Unlike many other 19th-century working class districts like Prenzlauer Berg, the original character of Wedding has been mostly preserved. It is still said though to be a place to find the &quot;Schnauze mit Herz&quot; (big mouth and big heart) of the Berlin working class.

The statistics used above are long out of date and need updating. By 2024, the district has also seen quite a long period of moving towards being a desirable part of Berlin to live, especially by the young creative class and that mixes with some of its deprived areas.

==Demographics==
Along with Kreuzberg, Wedding is one of the most ethnically diverse localities of Berlin. The multicultural atmosphere is visible in the bilingual shop signs (predominantly German and Turkish or German and Arabic).

In recent years Wedding has seen a significant influx of Africans, many of whom have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel, or African Quarter. Wedding is also home to an East Asian community, mostly from China, which is reflected in many Asian and African stores and restaurants. As of 2011, the ethnic make-up of Wedding was 52% of German origin, 18% Turks, 6% Sub-Saharan African, 6% Arabs, 6% Polish, 5% former Yugoslavia, and 4.5% Asian.

==Cityscape==
Many buildings are relics of European post-war Modernism. The &quot;Schillerpark&quot; estate in northern Wedding is part of the Modernist Housing Estates World Heritage Site. Beside monolithic housing blocks, several old buildings survived the war and urban renewal and still have coal-fired heating. The church of St. Joseph from 1909 has served as interim cathedral of Berlin from 2018.

A green oasis marks the west borders of the &quot;old red&quot; district, with Volkspark Rehberge, Goethepark and the idyllic Plötzensee, a lake in the southwest. It is a popular summer hang-out offering sandy beaches and long lawns. A section of the beach is reserved for Freikörperkultur, a German nudist movement.

Near Scharnweberstraße 158/159 is Germany&#x27;s last inner-city dune dating back to the last Ice Age.

<text>Mitte () is the first and most central borough of Berlin. The borough consists of six sub-entities: Mitte proper, Gesundbrunnen, Hansaviertel, Moabit, Tiergarten and Wedding.

It is one of the two boroughs (the other being Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg) which were formerly divided between East Berlin and West Berlin. Mitte encompasses Berlin&#x27;s historic core and includes some of the most important tourist sites of Berlin like the Reichstag and Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Checkpoint Charlie, Museum Island, the TV tower, Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden, Potsdamer Platz, Alexanderplatz, the latter six of which were in former East Berlin.

==Geography==

Mitte (German for &quot;middle&quot;, &quot;centre&quot;) is located in the central part of Berlin along the Spree River. It borders on Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf in the west, Reinickendorf in the north, Pankow in the east, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg in the southeast, and Tempelhof-Schöneberg in the southwest.

In the middle of the Spree lies Museum Island (&quot;Museumsinsel&quot;) with its museums, Berlin Cathedral (&quot;Berliner Dom&quot;) and Berlin Palace (&quot;Berliner Schloss&quot;). A central square in Mitte is Alexanderplatz with the prominent Fernsehturm (TV tower), Germany&#x27;s highest building, and the large railway station with connections to many subway (U-Bahn), tramway (Berlin trambahn), city trains (S-Bahn) and buses.

There are some important streets which connect Mitte with the other boroughs, e.g. the boulevard Unter den Linden which connects Berlin Palace with Brandenburg Gate and runs further as Straße des 17. Juni to the Victory Column and the centre of former West Berlin in Charlottenburg, or Karl-Marx-Allee from Alexanderplatz to Friedrichshain and the eastern suburbs.

==History==

The former Mitte district had been established by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act and comprised large parts of the historic city around Alt-Berlin and Cölln. Brandenburg Gate was the western exit at the Berlin city boundary until 1861.

Between 1961 and 1990, the area&#x27;s East Berlin portion was surrounded by the Berlin Wall on the north, south and west. There were some border control points, the most notable of which was Checkpoint Charlie between Kreuzberg and Mitte, which was operated by the United States Army and was open to foreigners and diplomats.

Two other checkpoints were at Heinrich-Heine-Straße/Prinzenstraße east of Checkpoint Charlie, open to citizens of West Germany and West Berlin and on Invalidenstraße in the north on the border with the West Berlin Tiergarten district (the present-day Moabit locality).

== Regierungsviertel (Government District) ==
The government district is located in the locality of Tiergarten around the Reichstag Building. Most institutions of the German government have their seat at the Regierungsviertel 
* Bundestag, the German parliament in the old Reichstag Building
* Bellevue Palace, seat of the Federal President 
* German Chancellery
* Offices of the Abgeordneten, members of the parliament, in the &quot;Paul-Löbe-Haus&quot; and the &quot;Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus&quot;
* Federal Ministry of the Interior
== Historische Mitte (Historic center) ==
The historic center is located in the locality of Mitte proper around the Berlin Palace.
* Berlin Palace / Humboldt Forum
* Berlin Cathedral
* Museum Island
* Nikolaiviertel
* Gendarmenmarkt
* Unter den Linden
* Brandenburg Gate
== Botschaftsviertel (Embassy Quarter) ==
Many embassies and the Federal Ministry of Defence in the historic embassy quarter in the south of the Tiergarten Park.
== Tiergarten Park ==
Großer Tiergarten is the name of the biggest urban park in Mitte, located in the same-named locality. Tiergarten Park was established as a hunting ground in the 16th century by the Prussian kings. Today it is enclosed by densely built-up areas by Hansaviertel and Moabit in the north, the Government District in the east and the City West and the Embassy Quarter in the southwest.

Many cultural monuments and memorials are located in the Tiergarten Park, like the Siegessäule, the Soviet War Memorial and a historic rose garden. The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, the biggest victim group of the Nazi dictatorship, is located on the east side of the park, near the Brandenburg Gate and near the place where Hitler&#x27;s New Reich Chancellery once was.
== Kulturforum ==
The Kulturforum was built in the 1950s and 1960s at the edge of West Berlin, after most of the once unified city&#x27;s cultural assets had been lost behind the Berlin Wall. The Kulturforum is characterized by its innovative modernist architecture; several buildings are distinguished by the organic designs of Hans Scharoun, and the Neue Nationalgalerie was designed by Mies van der Rohe, albeit originally as a private house.

Among the cultural institutions housed in and around the Kulturforum are:
* Neue Nationalgalerie
* Gemäldegalerie
* Museum of Decorative Arts
* Musical Instrument Museum
* Kupferstichkabinett (Print room)
* Art Library
* Berliner Philharmonie
* Chamber Music Hall
* Berlin State Library
* Ibero-American Institute
* Wissenschaftszentrum
* St. Matthäus-Kirche

== In arts and literature ==
*&quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;, a 1929 novel by Alfred Döblin
*&quot;Mitte 1&quot;, a 2013 novel by Albrecht Behmel
* &quot;Berlin-Mitte&quot;, Norman Ohler
* &quot;Unter diesem Einfluss&quot;, Henning Kober

==Subdivision==

The present-day borough of Mitte consists of six localities:
==Demographics==
, the borough had a population of 322,919, of whom 144.000 (44.5%) had a migration background. In the former West Berlin areas of Wedding, Gesundbrunnen and Moabit, foreigners and Germans of foreign origin compose nearly 70% of the population, while in Mitte proper the share of migrants is relatively low. The immigrant community is quite diverse, however, Turks, Africans, Eastern Europeans and East Asians form the largest groups.

==Politics==
===Borough assembly===
The governing body of Mitte is the borough assembly (&quot;Bezirksverordnetenversammlung&quot;). It has responsibility for passing laws and electing the borough administration, including the mayor. The most recent borough assembly election was held on 26 September 2021, and led to a coalition between the Greens and the social democrats.

The 2021 results were as follows:

===Borough government===
The borough mayor () is elected by the borough assembly, and positions in the borough administration () are apportioned based on party strength. Stefanie Remlinger of the Greens was elected mayor on 20 October 2022. Since the 2021 municipal elections, the composition of the borough administration is as follows:

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Mitte is twinned with:

<text>BEA Systems, Inc. was a company that specialized in enterprise infrastructure software products, which was wholly acquired by Oracle Corporation on April 29, 2008.

== History ==
BEA began as a software company, founded in 1995 and headquartered in San Jose, California. It grew to have 78 offices worldwide at the time of its acquisition by Oracle.

The company&#x27;s name is an initialism of the first names of the company&#x27;s three founders: Bill Coleman, Ed Scott, and Alfred Chuang. All were former employees of Sun Microsystems, and launched the business in 1995 by acquiring Information Management and Independence Technologies. These firms were the largest resellers of &quot;Tuxedo&quot;, a distributed transaction management system sold by Novell. BEA soon acquired the Tuxedo product itself, and went on to acquire other middleware companies and products.

In 1998, BEA acquired the San Francisco start-up WebLogic, which had built the first standards-based Java application server. WebLogic&#x27;s application server became the impetus for the Sun Microsystems&#x27; J2EE specification and formed the basis of BEA&#x27;s WebLogic application server sold today.

They were a sponsor for Team Rahal (now Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing) from 2002 to 2008, which included Buddy Rice&#x27;s 2004 Indianapolis 500 win and Vitor Meira&#x27;s 2005 Indianapolis 500 runner-up finish.

In 2005, BEA launched a new brand identity with the slogan &quot;Think Liquid.&quot;. BEA also announced a new product line called AquaLogic, which is an infrastructure software family for service-oriented architecture (SOA). The same year, it made its entrance into telecommunications infrastructure through the acquisition of Incomit, a Swedish telecommunications software provider. In late 2005, the company announced the acquisitions of Compoze Software, a provider of collaboration software, M7, an Eclipse-based tools company, and SolarMetric, editors of the &quot;Kodo&quot; persistence engine.

The acquisitions continued in 2006 with Plumtree Software, an enterprise portal company; Fuego, a business process management (BPM) software company; and Flashline, a metadata repository company. These acquisitions have since become parts of the AquaLogic SOA product stack.

On October 12, 2007, Oracle announced their intent to buy BEA Systems for $6.7 billion. As a result of the offer, BEA&#x27;s stock price rose over five dollars upon the opening of trading for the day. BEA turned the offer down the same day, saying that the company is &quot;worth substantially more&quot;. On January 16, 2008, Oracle signed a definite agreement to buy BEA for $8.5 billion. It is believed that Carl Icahn, one of the company&#x27;s most prominent shareholders, was the main reason that the deal happened.

On April 29, 2008, Oracle completed its acquisition of BEA.

== Products ==
BEA had three major product lines:
# Tuxedo, now Oracle Tuxedo transaction-oriented middleware platform
# BEA WebLogic, now Oracle WebLogic Server Java EE enterprise infrastructure platform
# AquaLogic, now Oracle Service Bus service-oriented architecture (SOA) platform

BEA started out with the Tuxedo software product, but the products they are best known for in the computer industry are the WebLogic product family, which consists of WebLogic Server, WebLogic Workshop, WebLogic Portal, WebLogic Integration, and JRockit. In 2005, BEA launched a new product family called AquaLogic for service-oriented architecture deployment. They have also entered the telecommunications field with their WebLogic Communications Platform, which includes WebLogic SIP Server and WebLogic Network Gatekeeper, technologies obtained through the acquisition of Swedish telecommunications software company Incomit. BEA also has a product offering for the RFID market called the BEA WebLogic RFID Product Family.

=== AquaLogic ===
BEA Systems produced the AquaLogic software suite for managing service-oriented architecture (SOA). It includes following products:

* BEA AquaLogic BPM suite, a set of business process management (BPM) tools. It combines workflow and process technology with enterprise application integration functionality. The suite consists of tools aimed for line of business personnel for creating business process models (AquaLogic BPM Designer), as well as tools for IT personnel to create actual business process applications directly from said models (AquaLogic BPM Studio). The completed business process applications are deployed on a production server (AquaLogic BPM Enterprise Server), from which they integrate to backend applications and generate portal views for human interactions in the process. It also comes with a customizable tools for live business activity monitoring (BAM).
* BEA AquaLogic User Interaction, a set of tools used to create portals, collaborative communities composite applications and other applications that use service architecture. These technologies work cross-platform. This technology came to BEA Systems from its acquisition of Plumtree Software.
* BEA AquaLogic Enterprise Repository, a vital element of effective Service-oriented architecture life cycle governance, manages the metadata for any type of software asset, from business processes and web services to patterns, frameworks, applications, and components. It maps the relationships and interdependencies that connect these assets to improve impact analysis, promote and systematize code reuse, and measure the impact on the bottom line.
* BEA AquaLogic Service Bus, an enterprise service bus (ESB) with operational service-management that allows the interaction between services, routing relationships, transformations, and policies.
* BEA AquaLogic Service Registry, a UDDI v3 registry with an embedded governance framework. It provides a repository where services can be registered and reused for developing or modifying applications.
* BEA AquaLogic Data Services Platform (previously known as Liquid Data), providing tools for creating and managing different data services. It uses the XQuery language for data composition and transformation for a variety of data sources, including relational databases and web services.
* BEA AquaLogic Enterprise Security, a security infrastructure application for distributed authentication, fine-grained entitlements and other security services. Features include allowing users to define access rules for applications without modifying the software itself, including JSP pages, EJBs, and portlets.
* BEA AquaLogic Commerce Services (often shortened as ALCS), an e-Commerce solution based on Elastic Path e-Commerce solution integrated with WebLogic application server. Discontinued on version 6.0 in 2009, a year after acquisition by Oracle.

<text>Intimate media are media artifacts created and collected by individuals, friends, and families to capture and commemorate aspects of family and intimate relationships. Intimate media includes such things as personal and family photo collections, home videos and films, diaries and journals, and letters. Depending on the meaning and values attributed to an object, anything could be considered intimate media. Great value is placed on intimate media possessions due to its ability to serve as &quot;proof&quot; that an event or memory actually occurred.

==Intimate media in relation to technology==
&quot;Our memory and the stories we create, share, retell and live are a powerful way in which we determine and express who we are.&quot;

In their chapter of &quot;The New Everyday: Views on Ambient Intelligence&quot;, entitled Intimate Media: Emotional Needs and Ambient Intelligence, John Cass, Lorna Goulden, and Slava Kozlov discuss the ways in which humans, as they &quot;become familiar with the potential of new technologies in their workplaces...find ways to re-use what they have encountered there and find benefits in other parts of their lives.&quot; This process has led to the onset of digital and social media-based &quot;intimate media,&quot; such as digital scrapbooks, email, text messaging, Pinterest pages, blogs, the &quot;messages&quot; portion of Facebook, online photo-sharing websites such as Flickr, and websites like YouTube. Human memory and computer memory are quite different in terms of their accuracy and durability. Storing intimate media on a computer mechanism helps to preserve the accuracy of the memory and lengthens its life as well. One potential problem with fusing intimate media and technology is that most technological intimate media is stored rather than displayed—it lives on hard drives, CDs, and the internet. The decorative nature of non-technological intimate media allows a person to imbue their living space with memories, triggers of happy moments, sentimental objects, and the like. The onset of technologies such as digital photo-frames, however, has begun to solve these technological deficiencies. This new virtual digital domain opens up a whole world of possibilities.
With intimate media now becoming increasingly digitalized, its potential for mobility, sharing, and copying is increasing drastically. Not only can a person transfer intimate media from one person or household to another, but the same intimate media can also be viewed simultaneously in a limitless number of locations. This opens up a new realm: ambient intelligence. Now intimate media is no longer confined to bookshelves, mantles, closets, and coffee tables. It can travel with a person in her/his pocket, via cell phone or other digital device, wherever s/he goes.

<text>Arnold Dreyblatt (born 1953) is an American composer, performance artist and visual artist.

== Biography ==
Arnold Dreyblatt was born in 1953 in New York City. His mother, Lucille Wallenrod (1918–1998), was a painter.

He started his studies at Wesleyan University in the 1970s and transferred to the Center for Media Study at the University at Buffalo. In 1982, Dreyblatt obtained a master&#x27;s degree in composition from Wesleyan University; his thesis was titled, &quot;Nodal Excitation&quot;. He studied music with Pauline Oliveros, La Monte Young and Alvin Lucier (at Wesleyan University), and new media art with Steina and Woody Vasulka.

In his installations, performances and media works, Dreyblatt creates complex textual and spatial metaphors for memory which function as a media discourse on recollection and the archive. His installations, public artworks and performances have been exhibited and staged extensively in Europe. Dreyblatt&#x27;s 2006 sculpture &quot;Innocent Questions&quot;, which resembles the layout of an IBM punch card, is installed at the Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities in Oslo, Norway.

Among the second generation of New York minimal composers, Dreyblatt developed a unique approach to composition and music performance. He invented a set of new and original instruments, performance techniques and a system of tuning. His compositions are based on harmonics and thus just intonation, played either through a bowing technique he developed for his modified double bass, and other modified and conventional instruments which he specially tuned. He originally used a steady pulse provided by the bowing motion on his double bass (placing his music in the minimal category), but he eventually added many more instruments and more rhythmic variety.

Dreyblatt received a 1998 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award. He has worked with Paul Panhuysen, Pierre Berthet and Ex-Easter Island Head.

He has been based in Berlin, Germany, since 1984. In 2007, he was elected to the Academy of Arts, Berlin.

==Collaboration==
Dreyblatt has collaborated on material with the psych-folk band Megafaun. They recorded an album in 2012 and performed at the third annual Hopscotch Music Festival in Raleigh, North Carolina, in September 2012 and at the Ecstatic Music Festival in New York City in February 2013.

<text>International Star Registry (ISR) is an organization founded in 1979 for the purpose of giving the general public the novelty of unofficially naming stars.

== Overview ==
The company sells the right to unofficially name a star, often as a gift or memorial. These names are recorded in the book &quot;Your Place in the Cosmos&quot;, and are not recognized by the scientific or astronomical community as the International Astronomical Union is the only internationally recognized authority for naming celestial bodies. Some astronomers have criticized the registry for not conforming to the IAU&#x27;s designations while others, like Edward Bowell, approved of it. The company&#x27;s director of marketing Elaine Stolpe stated that &quot;the service is not intended for scientific research; it is intended as a lasting gift.&quot;

Since its founding, International Star Registry has catalogued individual stars using coordinate data. It previously used data from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog, before switching to using data from the NASA Star Guide, which allowed them to locate stars down to the 16th magnitude. The stars are catalogued on charts stored at International Star Registry headquarters, and a catalogue of named stars is stored in a vault in Switzerland.

Customers are given a signed certificate, a booklet of star charts, and a chart identifying the named star. Packages sold by the company include framed certificates and personalized jewelry. The text of the certificates, with its blank spaces filled in by hand, is:

Advertisements for the International Star Registry air at the end of ABC News Radio&#x27;s top-of-the-hour reports.

== History ==
International Star Registry of Illinois was started in Toronto in 1979 by Ivor Downie, and is thought to be the earliest commercial star naming company. That year, the Toronto International Film Festival announced that it had purchased the naming rights to stars in the Andromeda Galaxy from the company, and would be naming them after festival patrons. In 1980, John and Phyllis Mosele bought an American franchise of the company. Phyllis had first learned of the company when she named a star for her husband as a gift.

The American company quickly grew in popularity, appearing on &quot;AM Chicago&quot; and Wally Phillips&#x27; WGN Morning Show. The Moseles purchased sole ownership in 1981 after Downie&#x27;s death. The present owner of the company is Rocky Mosele, one of John and Phyllis Mosele&#x27;s twelve children. The company has published nine large volumes of the copyrighted book named &quot;Your Place in the Cosmos&quot;.

After the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, the city of Daytona Beach named a star after each of the seven astronauts who died in the accident through the ISR.

In 1998, International Star Registry was issued a complaint by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs for deceptive advertising for claiming &quot;official&quot; naming rights. The Illinois Attorney General later found that the company had done no wrongdoing. International Star Registry&#x27;s FAQ states that only the International Astronomical Union has the right to name stars.

In 1999, the Delaware Museum of Natural History held a contest to name the star TYC 3429-697-1 in the Ursa Major constellation, after the museum purchased naming rights from International Star Registry. The star was named the &quot;Delaware Diamond&quot;, derived from Delaware&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Diamond State&quot;. Despite the nickname not having any scientific validity, a bill recognizing it as the official star of the State of Delaware was passed unanimously by the Delaware General Assembly in 2000.

International Star Registry named a star after each victim of the September 11 attacks as a memorial.

John Smith&#x27;s Brewery named stars in a pint glass-shaped constellation after fans who won a competition in 2015. As of 2017, the company had reportedly named over 2 million stars names.

Jack in the Box partnered with the company to nickname a constellation, shaped like the fast food chain&#x27;s mascot, after various food items offered by the franchise. The promotion was intended to celebrate the dual occurrence of Star Wars Day and National Space Day in May 2018. That same year, the company ran a promotion with the Sprint Corporation for customers who purchased a Samsung Galaxy S9 or S9+.

In 2019, as the series &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; neared its finale, Warner Bros. Television Studios announced that the ISR had nicknamed the Big Dipper constellation &quot;The Big Bang Dipper&quot; in honor of the show. Disney+ commemorated the launch of the Star content hub in February 2021 by naming several stars in International Star Registry.

== In popular culture ==

The company has also appeared in numerous films and television series. In the 2002 romantic coming-of-age film &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; depicts a young man (Shane West) naming a star after his girlfriend (Mandy Moore) through International Star Registry. International Star Registry appeared in the American Dad! episode &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Holodeck Boy&quot;, when Hayley buys Roger&#x27;s homestar, and claims to be his queen as a result.

A 1992 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article noted that the company had become popular with celebrities and politicians, with Elizabeth II, Charles III, and Diana, Princess of Wales receiving stars. Some stars have been nicknamed as a memorial, such as when William Baldwin nicknamed a star after John F. Kennedy Jr., in the wake of the latter&#x27;s death. Nicole Kidman named a star in the Hercules constellation &quot;Forever Tom&quot; in the listing, after her husband Tom Cruise. Winona Ryder also named a star after her then-boyfriend Johnny Depp.

Other public figures who have had stars named for them include Barry Manilow, Engelbert Humperdinck, Jon Pertwee, Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, and Lindsey Graham. Del E. Webb Construction Company named a star after Marco Rubio in 1993. Actor Kirk Douglas had a star named after him for his 99th birthday in 2015. 

In 2012, Anderson Cooper presented guest John Cusack, who had just received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with a star named after him in International Star Registry. Ellen DeGeneres presented 5-year old Xander Rynerson with a star named after him on a 2020 episode of &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;. In a 2020 episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Patrick Stewart had a star named for him after defeating Pete Buttigieg in a Star Trek trivia match.

At the 2015 Academy Awards, nominees were given stars named in their honor and hardcover copies of &quot;Your Place in the Cosmos, Vol. 10&quot;, inside of their Oscar gift bags.

<text>Verney Junction is a hamlet in the parish of Middle Claydon in north Buckinghamshire, England. It is on the route of the former Varsity Line. , the line is disused but is scheduled to be reopened by about 2025 as part of the East West Rail project.

The stone cottages that make up the hamlet were largely constructed to provide houses for workers on the railway in the early Victorian era. The hamlet is named after the railway junction around which it grew. The new village included a cricket ground for the railway workers.

The original junction here was established (without a station) by the Buckinghamshire Railway, which planned a Bletchley Banbury route (subsequently the &#x27;Banbury to Verney Junction Branch Line&#x27;) and a Bletchley Oxford route. The section was completed in May 1850 and the section from here to was completed in October of the same year. Verney Junction railway station was added when the Metropolitan Railway was extended here (from Baker Street).

Local legend has it that the station was so called because the then isolation of the area meant that the only obvious name was that of the local landowner, the Verney family of Claydon House.

<text>Verney Junction railway station was an isolated railway station at a four-way railway junction in Buckinghamshire, open from 1868 to 1968; a junction existed at the site without a station from 1851.

The first line to open on the site was the Buckinghamshire Railway, which opened a line from Bletchley to Banbury in 1850; a line branching west to Oxford followed in 1851. This formed an east–west link from Oxford to Bletchley and Cambridge passing through Verney Junction and this, known as the Varsity line, became the busiest line through the site, leaving the line to Banbury as a relatively quiet branch. The station opened in 1868 concurrently with the opening of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (later owned by London Underground) towards Aylesbury and London. Soon after the Buckinghamshire Railway became absorbed into the London and North Western Railway.

The lines south to Aylesbury closed to passengers in 1936 and the line to Buckingham in 1964, but the station remained open until the Oxford-Cambridge line closed to passengers in 1968. The track was singled and then mothballed, but a disused track has remained through the station site. As part of East West Rail, the line between Oxford and Bletchley is to be reopened by 2025, but because of its isolated location Verney Junction will not be reopened.

While never very busy, Verney Junction was a local interchange point for a century from which excursions as far as Ramsgate could be booked. Situated from Baker Street, the station is one of London&#x27;s disused Underground stations and, although it never carried heavy traffic, the Aylesbury line was important in the expansion of the Metropolitan Railway into what became Metro-land.

== Station history ==
=== Opening ===
Verney Junction opened in 1868 as northern terminus of the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway&#x27;s (A&amp;BR) single track from Aylesbury. The station was at a junction with the Buckinghamshire Railway&#x27;s Bletchley to Oxford line, which was leased and operated by the LNWR before it acquired the route altogether in 1878. The station was built east of Steeple Claydon, and constructed to a rudimentary design at the cost of the A&amp;BR, whose progress the LNWR viewed with disfavour.

Plans to extend the railway north to Buckingham never materialised and Verney Junction remained remote with a few cottages for tenants of Claydon House estate. Claydon&#x27;s occupant, Sir Harry Verney, was on the board of the A&amp;BR which was chaired by the Duke of Buckingham, and he invested heavily in the scheme. There being no settlement from which the station could take its name, it was named in honour of Sir Harry, who was later to have another nearby station – Calvert – named after him; he had been born Harry Calvert, and took the surname Verney in order to inherit his late cousin&#x27;s estates in 1827.

=== Early years ===
The A&amp;BR initially began advertising services to and from Banbury, Oxford and Bletchley but the LNWR attempted to isolate the A&amp;BR by encouraging passengers to take its longer route to Aylesbury via Bletchley and Cheddington. The A&amp;BR turned to the Great Western Railway (GWR), with whom it managed Aylesbury, to agree to services over the GWR&#x27;s Wycombe Railway; the Wycombe line was converted to standard gauge on 23 October 1868 and A&amp;BR services were reinstated.

The GWR worked the A&amp;BR for more than 20 years, turning down the chance to acquire it in 1874, although for the first six years the route was operated by the A&amp;BR&#x27;s own staff, except for footplate crews who were GWR employees. Traffic was initially &quot;almost non-existent&quot; due to Verney Junction&#x27;s rural locality, but the Metropolitan Railway under the influence of Sir Edward Watkin nevertheless saw an opportunity for growth and absorbed the A&amp;BR on 1 July 1891. The A&amp;BR would be the line that the London Extension of Watkin&#x27;s Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) would meet at Quainton Road. In anticipation of the connection, the A&amp;BR was doubled by 1897 and the Metropolitan extended its line from Chalfont Road to Aylesbury in 1892.

=== Metropolitan era ===

Not long after the Metropolitan reached its northern outpost, Verney Junction was elevated to main line status with the opening of the MS&amp;LR&#x27;s London Extension (later to be known as the Great Central Railway). Around the same time, the Metropolitan inaugurated a service of through trains between Baker Street and Verney Junction, although this could hardly be said to be merited on the basis of traffic. From 2 April 1906, all Metropolitan services north of Harrow South Junction to Verney Junction came under the control of the Metropolitan &amp; Great Central Joint Committee which had been set up by an Act of Parliament to manage the companies&#x27; joint lines.

The Metropolitan opened another intermediate station on the A&amp;BR at Waddesdon in 1897, adding to the three existing stations at Grandborough Road, Quainton Road and Winslow Road which had opened in 1868. A new Pullman service was introduced in 1910 as part of a drive to attract first-class paying passengers from the Great Central; two Pullman coaches named &quot;Mayflower&quot; and &quot;Galatea&quot; were used on alternate weeks between Verney Junction, Chesham and London.

The Metropolitan was vested in the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) on 1 July 1933 and freight and passenger workings to Verney Junction continued in trains repainted with the London Transport lettering. However, little over three years later, the LPTB decided to discontinue their services beyond Aylesbury and in consequence two Metropolitan outposts were closed — the Brill Tramway ended on 30 November 1935 and passenger services ceased between Quainton Road and Verney Junction on 6 July 1936 when the line was singled. Freight services continued until 8 September 1947 when the line closed. The track to Winslow Road was used for stock storage until 1961.

=== Decline and closure ===
Although the two World Wars brought an increase in freight traffic from Verney Junction to London, with considerable volumes of freight passing through the station&#x27;s transfer sidings, the post-war period saw a decline in the station&#x27;s fortunes. The closure of the Aylesbury-Verney section by the LPTB in 1936 was followed by the removal of one of the line&#x27;s tracks on 28 January 1940. In the same year, freight traffic through Verney Junction was substantially diminished by the opening on 14 September 1940 of an east-facing connecting spur between the LNWR and GCR lines at Calvert which enabled freight from the Oxford-Bletchley route to work south over the Great Central Main Line without having to pass over the Verney Junction-Quainton Road section.
By the end of 1940, Verney Junction was effectively left &quot;severed from its purpose&quot;, having little usefulness other than as a rural interchange for local services. It played a useful part in the transfer of goods between the interconnecting lines, but passenger traffic declined in the face of the availability of more direct routes to and from Banbury and Oxford. Goods services were withdrawn in 1964 and later that year the line to Buckingham was closed. The station closed completely when all passenger services were withdrawn in 1968. After closure, the track on the northern section of the A&amp;BR between Verney Junction and Winslow Road was retained until 1961, including the former Metropolitan sidings which were subsequently used for storing veteran railway vehicles.

== Routes ==

== Present and future ==
A single-track freight line from Bletchley to Bicester was retained and then abandoned in place in 1993. Until late 2019, this track had remained rusted beyond use and in overgrown state, albeit with modern signage still warning travellers to watch for approaching trains. From early 2020, the route has been cleared as part of engineering works on the East West Rail project. Of the station itself, the stationmaster&#x27;s house remains as a private residence, and the station ticket office has become a private garage. The platform edges have also survived in a dilapidated state. The stationmaster&#x27;s house&#x27;s garden occupies the former Metropolitan trackbed.

, works are scheduled for &quot;late 2020&quot; to begin clearing the route for the new line.

<text>Asphalt concrete (commonly called asphalt, blacktop, or pavement in North America, and [[Tarmacadam|tarmac]] or bitumen macadam in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) is a composite material commonly used to surface roads, parking lots, airports, and the core of embankment dams. Asphalt mixtures have been used in pavement construction since the nineteenth century. It consists of mineral aggregate bound together with bitumen (a substance also independently known as asphalt, pitch, or tar), laid in layers, and compacted.

The American English terms &quot;asphalt&quot; (or &quot;asphaltic&quot;) &quot;concrete&quot;, &quot;bituminous asphalt concrete&quot;, and &quot;bituminous mixture&quot; are typically used only in engineering and construction documents, which define concrete as any composite material composed of mineral aggregate adhered with a binder. The abbreviation, &quot;AC&quot;, is sometimes used for &quot;asphalt concrete&quot; but can also denote &quot;asphalt content&quot; or &quot;asphalt cement&quot;, referring to the liquid asphalt portion of the composite material.
==History==
Natural asphalt (Ancient Greek: ἄσφαλτος (&quot;ásphaltos&quot;)) has been known of and used since antiquity, in Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Carthage, and Rome, to waterproof temple baths, reservoirs, aqueducts, tunnels, and moats, as a masonry mortar, to cork vessels, and surface roads. The Procession Street of Babylonian King Nabopolassar, c. 625 BC, leading north from his palace through the city&#x27;s wall, being described as being constructed from burnt brick and asphalt. Natural asphalt covered and bonded cobbles were used from 1824, in France, as a means to construct roads. In 1829 natural Seyssel asphalt mixed with 7% aggregate, to create an asphat-mastic surface was used for a footpath at Pont Morand, Lyons, France, the technique spreading to Paris in 1835, London, England, in 1836, and the Philadelphia, USA, in 1838. A two mile stretch of a gravel constructed road, running out of Nottingham, and Huntingdon High Street, were experimentally covered is natural asphalt during the 1840s. The first Macadam road surfaced with asphalt was constructed in 1852, between Paris and Perpignan, France, using Swiss Val de Travers rock asphalt (natural asphalt covered limestone aggregate). In 1869, Threadneedle Street, in London, England was resurfaced with Swiss Val de Travers rock asphalt. A process to surface a packed sand road through application of heated natural asphalt mixed with sand, in a ratio of 1:5, rolling, and hardened through the application of natural asphalt mixed with a petroleum oil, was invented by Belgian-American chemist Edward De Smedt, at Columbia University, in 1870, obtaining a pair of U.S. patents for the material and method of hardening. Civil Engineer, Surveyor, and an English county Highway board member, Edgar Purnell Hooley created a process and engine to combine a synthetic, refined petroleum tar, and resin, with Macadam aggregates (gravel, portland cement, crushed rocks, and blast furnace slag) in a steam heated mixer, at 212 °F, and through a heated reservoir, conduits, and meshes, create a machine and material that can be applied to form a road surface, filing a UK patent, in 1902, for his improvement. Hooley founding a UK company to market the technology, where the term tar macadam, shortened to tarmac was coined, after the name of his company&quot;Tar Macadam (Purnell Hooley&#x27;s Patent) Syndicate Limited&quot;, derived from the combination of tar and Macadam gravel composite mixtures. 

== Mixture formulations == 
Mixing of asphalt and aggregate is accomplished in one of several ways:
; Hot-mix asphalt concrete (commonly abbreviated as HMA): This is produced by heating the asphalt binder to decrease its viscosity and drying the aggregate to remove moisture from it prior to mixing. Mixing is generally performed with the aggregate at about for virgin asphalt and for polymer modified asphalt, and the asphalt cement at . Paving and compaction must be performed while the asphalt is sufficiently hot. In many locales paving is restricted to summer months because in winter the base will cool the asphalt too quickly before it can be packed to the required density. HMA is the form of asphalt concrete most commonly used on high traffic pavements such as those on major highways, racetracks and airfields. It is also used as an environmental liner for landfills, reservoirs, and fish hatchery ponds.

; Warm-mix asphalt concrete (commonly abbreviated as WMA): This is produced by adding either zeolites, waxes, asphalt emulsions or sometimes water to the asphalt binder prior to mixing. This allows significantly lower mixing and laying temperatures and results in lower consumption of fossil fuels, thus releasing less carbon dioxide, aerosols and vapors. This improves working conditions, and lowers laying-temperature, which leads to more rapid availability of the surface for use, which is important for construction sites with critical time schedules. The usage of these additives in hot-mixed asphalt (above) may afford easier compaction and allow cold-weather paving or longer hauls. Use of warm mix is rapidly expanding. A survey of US asphalt producers found that nearly 25% of asphalt produced in 2012 was warm mix, a 416% increase since 2009. Cleaner road pavements can be potentially developed by combining WMA and material recycling. Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) technology has environmental, production, and economic benefits.
; Cold-mix asphalt concrete: This is produced by emulsifying the asphalt in water with an emulsifying agent before mixing with the aggregate. While in its emulsified state, the asphalt is less viscous and the mixture is easy to work and compact. The emulsion will break after enough water evaporates and the cold mix will, ideally, take on the properties of an HMA pavement. Cold mix is commonly used as a patching material and on lesser-trafficked service roads.
; Cut-back asphalt concrete: Is a form of &quot;cold mix asphalt&quot; produced by dissolving the binder in kerosene or another lighter fraction of petroleum before mixing with the aggregate. While in its dissolved state, the asphalt is less viscous and the mix is easy to work and compact. After the mix is laid down the lighter fraction evaporates. Because of concerns with pollution from the volatile organic compounds in the lighter fraction, cut-back asphalt has been largely replaced by asphalt emulsion.
; Mastic asphalt concrete, or sheet asphalt: This is produced by heating hard grade blown bitumen (i.e., partly oxidised) in a green cooker (mixer) until it has become a viscous liquid after which the aggregate mix is then added. The bitumen aggregate mixture is cooked (matured) for around 6–8 hours and once it is ready, the mastic asphalt mixer is transported to the work site where experienced layers empty the mixer and either machine or hand lay the mastic asphalt contents on to the road. Mastic asphalt concrete is generally laid to a thickness of around for footpath and road applications and around for flooring or roof applications.
; High-modulus asphalt concrete, sometimes referred to by the French-language acronym EMÉ (enrobé à module élevé): This uses a very hard bituminous formulation (penetration 10/20), sometimes modified, in proportions close to 6% by weight of the aggregates, as well as a high proportion of mineral powder (between 8–10%) to create an asphalt concrete layer with a high modulus of elasticity (of the order of 13000MPa). This makes it possible to reduce the thickness of the base layer up to 25% (depending on the temperature) in relation to conventional bitumen, while offering as very high fatigue strengths. High-modulus asphalt layers are used both in reinforcement operations and in the construction of new reinforcements for medium and heavy traffic. In base layers, they tend to exhibit a greater capacity of absorbing tensions and, in general, better fatigue resistance.

In addition to the asphalt and aggregate, additives, such as polymers, and antistripping agents may be added to improve the properties of the final product.

Areas paved with asphalt concrete—especially airport aprons—have been called &quot;the tarmac&quot; at times, despite not being constructed using the tarmacadam process.

A variety of specialty asphalt concrete mixtures have been developed to meet specific needs, such as stone-matrix asphalt, which is designed to ensure a strong wearing surface, or porous asphalt pavements, which are permeable and allow water to drain through the pavement for controlling storm water.

== Roadway performance characteristics ==
Different types of asphalt concrete have different performance characteristics in roads in terms of surface durability, tire wear, braking efficiency and roadway noise. In principle, the determination of appropriate asphalt performance characteristics must take into account the volume of traffic in each vehicle category, and the performance requirements of the friction course. In general, the viscosity of asphalt allows it to conveniently form a convex surface, and a central apex to streets and roads to drain water to the edges. This is not, however, in itself an advantage over concrete, which has various grades of viscosity and can be formed into a convex road surface. Rather, it is the economy of asphalt concrete that renders it more frequently used. Concrete is found on interstate highways where maintenance is highly crucial.

Asphalt concrete generates less roadway noise than a Portland cement concrete surface, and is typically less noisy than chip seal surfaces. Because tire noise is generated through the conversion of kinetic energy to sound waves, more noise is produced as the speed of a vehicle increases. The notion that highway design might take into account acoustical engineering considerations, including the selection of the type of surface paving, arose in the early 1970s.

With regard to structural performance, the asphalt behaviour depends on a variety of factors including the material, loading and environmental condition. Furthermore, the performance of pavement varies over time. Therefore, the long-term behaviour of asphalt pavement is different from its short-term performance. The LTPP is a research program by the FHWA, which is specifically focusing on long-term pavement behaviour.

== Degradation and restoration ==
Asphalt deterioration can include crocodile cracking, potholes, upheaval, raveling, bleeding, rutting, shoving, stripping, and grade depressions. In cold climates, frost heaves can crack asphalt even in one winter. Filling the cracks with bitumen is a temporary fix, but only proper compaction and drainage can slow this process.

Factors that cause asphalt concrete to deteriorate over time mostly fall into one of three categories: construction quality, environmental considerations, and traffic loads. Often, damage results from combinations of factors in all three categories.

Construction quality is critical to pavement performance. This includes the construction of utility trenches and appurtenances that are placed in the pavement after construction. Lack of compaction in the surface of the asphalt, especially on the longitudinal joint, can reduce the life of a pavement by 30 to 40%. Service trenches in pavements after construction have been said to reduce the life of the pavement by 50%, mainly due to the lack of compaction in the trench, and also because of water intrusion through improperly sealed joints.

Environmental factors include heat and cold, the presence of water in the subbase or subgrade soil underlying the pavement, and frost heaves.

High temperatures soften the asphalt binder, allowing heavy tire loads to deform the pavement into ruts. Paradoxically, high heat and strong sunlight also cause the asphalt to oxidize, becoming stiffer and less resilient, leading to crack formation. Cold temperatures can cause cracks as the asphalt contracts. Cold asphalt is also less resilient and more vulnerable to cracking.

Water trapped under the pavement softens the subbase and subgrade, making the road more vulnerable to traffic loads. Water under the road freezes and expands in cold weather, causing and enlarging cracks. In spring thaw, the ground thaws from the top down, so water is trapped between the pavement above and the still-frozen soil underneath. This layer of saturated soil provides little support for the road above, leading to the formation of potholes. This is more of a problem for silty or clay soils than sandy or gravelly soils. Some jurisdictions pass frost laws to reduce the allowable weight of trucks during the spring thaw season and protect their roads.

The damage a vehicle causes is roughly proportional to the axle load raised to the fourth power, so doubling the weight an axle carries actually causes 16 times as much damage. Wheels cause the road to flex slightly, resulting in fatigue cracking, which often leads to crocodile cracking. Vehicle speed also plays a role. Slowly moving vehicles stress the road over a longer period of time, increasing ruts, cracking, and corrugations in the asphalt pavement.

Other causes of damage include heat damage from vehicle fires, or solvent action from chemical spills.
=== Prevention and repair of degradation ===
The life of a road can be prolonged through good design, construction and maintenance practices. During design, engineers measure the traffic on a road, paying special attention to the number and types of trucks. They also evaluate the subsoil to see how much load it can withstand. The pavement and subbase thicknesses are designed to withstand the wheel loads. Sometimes, geogrids are used to reinforce the subbase and further strengthen the roads. Drainage, including ditches, storm drains and underdrains are used to remove water from the roadbed, preventing it from weakening the subbase and subsoil.

Sealcoating asphalt is a maintenance measure that helps keep water and petroleum products out of the pavement.

Maintaining and cleaning ditches and storm drains will extend the life of the road at low cost. Sealing small cracks with bituminous crack sealer prevents water from enlarging cracks through frost weathering, or percolating down to the subbase and softening it.

For somewhat more distressed roads, a chip seal or similar surface treatment may be applied. As the number, width and length of cracks increases, more intensive repairs are needed. In order of generally increasing expense, these include thin asphalt overlays, multicourse overlays, grinding off the top course and overlaying, in-place recycling, or full-depth reconstruction of the roadway.

It is far less expensive to keep a road in good condition than it is to repair it once it has deteriorated. This is why some agencies place the priority on preventive maintenance of roads in good condition, rather than reconstructing roads in poor condition. Poor roads are upgraded as resources and budget allow. In terms of lifetime cost and long term pavement conditions, this will result in better system performance. Agencies that concentrate on restoring their bad roads often find that by the time they have repaired them all, the roads that were in good condition have deteriorated.

Some agencies use a pavement management system to help prioritize maintenance and repairs.

== Recycling ==
Asphalt concrete is a recyclable material that can be reclaimed and reused both on-site and in asphalt plants. The most common recycled component in asphalt concrete is reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). RAP is recycled at a greater rate than any other material in the United States. Many roofing shingles also contain asphalt, and asphalt concrete mixes may contain reclaimed asphalt shingles (RAS). Research has demonstrated that RAP and RAS can replace the need for up to 100% of the virgin aggregate and asphalt binder in a mix, but this percentage is typically lower due to regulatory requirements and performance concerns. In 2019, new asphalt pavement mixtures produced in the United States contained, on average, 21.1% RAP and 0.2% RAS.

=== Recycling methods ===
Recycled asphalt components may be reclaimed and transported to an asphalt plant for processing and use in new pavements, or the entire recycling process may be conducted in-place. While in-place recycling typically occurs on roadways and is specific to RAP, recycling in asphalt plants may utilize RAP, RAS, or both. In 2019, an estimated 97.0 million tons of RAP and 1.1 million tons of RAS were accepted by asphalt plants in the United States.

RAP is typically received by plants after being milled on-site, but pavements may also be ripped out in larger sections and crushed in the plant. RAP millings are typically stockpiled at plants before being incorporated into new asphalt mixes. Prior to mixing, stockpiled millings may be dried and any that have agglomerated in storage may have to be crushed.

RAS may be received by asphalt plants as post-manufacturer waste directly from shingle factories, or they may be received as post-consumer waste at the end of their service life. Processing of RAS includes grinding the shingles and sieving the grinds to remove oversized particles. The grinds may also be screened with a magnetic sieve to remove nails and other metal debris. The ground RAS is then dried, and the asphalt cement binder can be extracted. For further information on RAS processing, performance, and associated health and safety concerns, see Asphalt Shingles.

In-place recycling methods allow roadways to be rehabilitated by reclaiming the existing pavement, remixing, and repaving on-site. In-place recycling techniques include rubblizing, hot in-place recycling, cold in-place recycling, and full-depth reclamation. For further information on in-place methods, see Road Surface.

=== Performance ===
During its service life, the asphalt cement binder, which makes up about 5–6% of a typical asphalt concrete mix, naturally hardens and becomes stiffer. This aging process primarily occurs due to oxidation, evaporation, exudation, and physical hardening. For this reason, asphalt mixes containing RAP and RAS are prone to exhibiting lower workability and increased susceptibility to fatigue cracking. These issues are avoidable if the recycled components are apportioned correctly in the mix. Practicing proper storage and handling, such as by keeping RAP stockpiles out of damp areas or direct sunlight, is also important in avoiding quality issues. The binder aging process may also produce some beneficial attributes, such as by contributing to higher levels of rutting resistance in asphalts containing RAP and RAS.

One approach to balancing the performance aspects of RAP and RAS is to combine the recycled components with virgin aggregate and virgin asphalt binder. This approach can be effective when the recycled content in the mix is relatively low, and has a tendency to work more effectively with soft virgin binders. A 2020 study found that the addition of 5% RAS to a mix with a soft, low-grade virgin binder significantly increased the mix&#x27;s rutting resistance while maintaining adequate fatigue cracking resistance.

In mixes with higher recycled content, the addition of virgin binder becomes less effective, and rejuvenators may be used. Rejuvenators are additives that restore the physical and chemical properties of the aged binder. When conventional mixing methods are used in asphalt plants, the upper limit for RAP content before rejuvenators become necessary has been estimated at 50%. Research has demonstrated that the use of rejuvenators at optimal doses can allow for mixes with 100% recycled components to meet the performance requirements of conventional asphalt concrete.

=== Other recycled materials in asphalt concrete ===
Beyond RAP and RAS, a range of waste materials can be re-used in place of virgin aggregate, or as rejuvenators. Crumb rubber, generated from recycled tires, has been demonstrated to improve the fatigue resistance and flexural strength of asphalt mixes that contain RAP. In California, legislative mandates require the Department of Transportation to incorporate crumb rubber into asphalt paving materials. Other recycled materials that are actively included in asphalt concrete mixes across the United States include steel slag, blast furnace slag, and cellulose fibers.

Further research has been conducted to discover new forms of waste that may be recycled into asphalt mixes. A 2020 study conducted in Melbourne, Australia presented a range of strategies for incorporating waste materials into asphalt concrete. The strategies presented in the study include the use of plastics, particularly high-density polyethylene, in asphalt binders, and the use of glass, brick, ceramic, and marble quarry waste in place of traditional aggregate.

Rejuvenators may also be produced from recycled materials, including waste engine oil, waste vegetable oil, and waste vegetable grease.

Recently, discarded face masks have been incorporated into stone mastic.

<doc id="387800" wikidata="Q2855440" url="?curid=387800" title="Boston Strangler">
<text>The Boston Strangler is the name given to the murderer of 13 women in Greater Boston during the early 1960s. The crimes were attributed to Albert DeSalvo based on his confession, on details revealed in court during a separate case, and DNA evidence linking him to the final victim.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica/Boston-Strangler&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following DeSalvo&#x27;s conviction – but prior to the emergence of this DNA evidence – various parties investigating the crimes suggested that the murders (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Silk Stocking Murders&quot;) were committed by more than one person.&lt;ref name=&quot;streiber/273/desalvo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
Initially, the crimes were assumed to be the work of one unknown person dubbed &quot;The Mad Strangler of Boston&quot;. On July 8, 1962, the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;[a] mad strangler is loose in Boston&quot; in an article titled &quot;Mad Strangler Kills Four Women in Boston&quot;. The killer was also known as the &quot;Phantom Fiend&quot; or &quot;Phantom Strangler&quot;, due to his ability to get women to allow him into their apartments. In 1963, two investigative reporters for the &quot;Record American&quot;, Jean Cole&lt;ref name=&quot;patch/ma/chtn/jean-cole-89&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Loretta McLaughlin, wrote a four-part series about the killer, dubbing him &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;smithsonianmag/180981786&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the time that DeSalvo&#x27;s confession was aired in open court, the name &quot;Boston Strangler&quot; had become part of crime lore.

==Events==
Between June 14, 1962, and January 4, 1964, 13 single women between the ages of 19 and 85 were murdered in the Boston area. Most were sexually assaulted and strangled in their apartments. Originally, the police believed that one man was the sole perpetrator. With no sign of forced entry into their homes, the women were assumed to have let their assailant in, either because they may have known him or because they believed him to be a service provider. The attacks continued despite extensive media publicity after the first few murders. Many residents purchased tear gas and new locks and deadbolts for their doors.&lt;ref name=&quot;google/books=n0EEAAAAMBAJ&quot;&gt;Byers, Margery. “Fear walks home with the women.” Life, February 15, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Some women even moved out of the area in response to the killings.

The murders occurred in several cities, including Boston, complicating jurisdictional oversight for prosecution of the crimes. Massachusetts Attorney General Edward W. Brooke helped to coordinate the various police forces. He permitted parapsychologist Peter Hurkos to use his alleged extrasensory perception to analyze the cases, for which Hurkos claimed that a single person was responsible. This decision was controversial. Hurkos provided a &quot;minutely detailed description of the wrong person&quot;, and the press ridiculed Brooke. The police were not convinced that all the murders were the actions of one person, although much of the public believed so. The apparent connections between a majority of the victims and hospitals were widely discussed.

==Victims==
==DeSalvo&#x27;s confession==
On October 27, 1964, a stranger entered a young woman&#x27;s home posing as a detective. He tied the victim to her bed, sexually assaulted her, and suddenly left, saying &quot;I&#x27;m sorry&quot; as he went. The woman&#x27;s description of her attacker led police to identify the assailant as DeSalvo. When his photo was published, many women identified him as the man who had assaulted them. Earlier on October 27, DeSalvo had posed as a motorist with car trouble and attempted to enter a home in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The homeowner, future Brockton police chief Richard Sproules, became suspicious and eventually fired a shotgun at DeSalvo.

DeSalvo was not initially suspected of being involved with the strangling murders. After he was charged with rape, he gave a detailed confession of his activities as the Boston Strangler. He initially confessed to fellow inmate George Nassar. Nassar reported the confession to his attorney F. Lee Bailey, who also took on the defense of DeSalvo. The police were impressed at the accuracy of DeSalvo&#x27;s descriptions of the crime scenes. There were some inconsistencies, but DeSalvo was able to cite details that had been withheld from the public. Bailey states in his 1971 book, &quot;The Defense Never Rests&quot;, that DeSalvo got one detail right that one of the victims was wrong about: DeSalvo described a blue chair in the woman&#x27;s living room. She stated it was brown. Photographic evidence proved DeSalvo was correct.

No physical evidence substantiated his confession. Because of that, he was tried on charges for earlier, unrelated crimes of robbery and sexual offenses, in which he was known as &quot;The Green Man&quot; and &quot;The Measuring Man&quot;, respectively. Bailey brought up DeSalvo&#x27;s confession to the murders as part of his client&#x27;s history at the trial in order to assist in gaining a &quot;not guilty by reason of insanity&quot; verdict to the sexual offenses, but it was ruled as inadmissible by the judge.

DeSalvo was sentenced to life in prison in 1967. In February of that year, he escaped with two fellow inmates from Bridgewater State Hospital, triggering a full-scale manhunt. A note was found on his bunk addressed to the superintendent. In it, DeSalvo stated that he had escaped to focus attention on the conditions in the hospital and his own situation. Immediately after his escape, DeSalvo disguised himself as a U.S. Navy Petty Officer Third Class, but he gave himself up the following day. After the escape, he was transferred to the maximum security Walpole State Prison. Six years after the transfer, he was found stabbed to death in the prison infirmary. His killer or killers were never identified.

==Multiple-killer theories==
Doubts persist as to whether DeSalvo was the sole perpetrator behind the Boston Strangler murders. At the time of his confession, people who knew him personally did not believe him capable of such vicious crimes. Several factors created doubt that a serial killer was involved, given that they characteristically have a certain type of victim and method of murder: women killed by &quot;The Strangler&quot; were from a variety of age and ethnic groups, and they were murdered using multiple methods.

In 1968, Dr. Ames Robey, medical director of Bridgewater State Hospital, insisted that DeSalvo was not the Boston Strangler. He said the prisoner was &quot;a very clever, very smooth compulsive confessor who desperately needs to be recognized.&quot; Robey&#x27;s opinion was shared by Middlesex District Attorney John J. Droney, Bridgewater Superintendent Charles Gaughan, and George W. Harrison, a former fellow inmate of DeSalvo&#x27;s. Harrison claimed to have overheard another convict coaching DeSalvo about details of the strangling murders.

DeSalvo&#x27;s attorney Bailey believed that his client was the killer, and described the case in &quot;The Defense Never Rests&quot; (1971). Susan Kelly, author of the book &quot;The Boston Stranglers&quot; (1996), drew from the files of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts &quot;Strangler Bureau&quot;. She argues that the murders were the work of several killers rather than a single individual. Former FBI profiler Robert Ressler said, &quot;You&#x27;re putting together so many different patterns [regarding the Boston Strangler murders] that it&#x27;s inconceivable behaviorally that all these could fit one individual.&quot;

John E. Douglas, the former FBI special agent who was one of the first criminal profilers, doubted that DeSalvo was the Boston Strangler. In his book &quot;The Cases That Haunt Us&quot;, he identified DeSalvo as a &quot;power-assurance&quot; motivated rapist. He said that such a rapist is unlikely to kill in the manner of crimes attributed to the Boston Strangler; a power-assurance motivated rapist would, however, be prone to taking credit for the crimes.

In 2000, attorney and former print journalist Elaine Sharp took up the cause of the DeSalvo family and that of the family of Mary Sullivan. Sullivan was publicized as being the final victim in 1964, although other strangling murders occurred after that date. Sharp assisted the families in their media campaign to clear DeSalvo&#x27;s name. She helped organize and arrange the exhumations of Mary Sullivan and Albert H. DeSalvo, filed various lawsuits in attempts to obtain information and trace evidence (e.g., DNA) from the government, and worked with various producers to create documentaries to explain the facts to the public.

Sharp noted various inconsistencies between DeSalvo&#x27;s confessions and the crime scene information (which she obtained). For example, she observed that, contrary to DeSalvo&#x27;s confession to Sullivan&#x27;s murder, the woman was found to have no semen in her vagina and she was not strangled manually, but by ligature. Forensic pathologist Michael Baden noted that DeSalvo got the time of death wrong. This was a common inconsistency also pointed out by Susan Kelly in several of the murders. She continued to work on the case for the DeSalvo family.

== DNA evidence ==
On July 11, 2013, the Boston Police Department announced that they had found DNA evidence that linked DeSalvo to the murder of Mary Sullivan. DNA found at the scene was a &quot;near certain match&quot; to Y-DNA taken from a nephew of DeSalvo. Y-DNA is passed through the direct male lines with little change and can be used to link males with a common paternal-line ancestor. A court ordered the exhumation of DeSalvo&#x27;s corpse to test his DNA directly. On July 19, 2013, Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis announced the DNA test results proving that DeSalvo was the source of seminal fluid recovered at the scene of Sullivan&#x27;s 1964 murder.

<text>The ALCO Century 415 is a diesel-electric locomotive of B-B wheel arrangement produced by the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) as part of their Century Series of locomotives.

==Specifications==
The C415 is a large switcher locomotive or small road switcher locomotive equipped with a raised cab mounted slightly off-center, with a lower, narrower hood on either side. The longer one contained the diesel engine, a eight-cylinder turbocharged Alco 251-F, while the shorter contained auxiliaries. The C415 could be ordered with three different cab heights; a low one for minimum clearances, a regular height one, and an extra-height one for maximum visibility.
Trucks fitted were either Type B standard road trucks or ALCO Hi-Ad (high adhesion) Type B trucks.

==Service history==
The locomotive was not very popular; 26 were built between 1966 and 1968 for seven different owners. The locomotive may still be in use. According to the November 2011 issue of &quot;Railfan &amp; Railroad&quot; magazine, the Burlington Junction Railway owned three C415s numbered 21, 701 and 702.

==Original owners==
*Hamersley Iron in Western Australia bought the prototype in May 1968, formerly lettered as &quot;ALCO 415&quot;. The locomotive was equipped with a medium height cab and AAR Type B trucks.
*Chehalis Western Railroad bought a single high cab unit with Hi-Ad trucks. 
*Columbia and Cowlitz Railway bought a single high cab unit with Hi-Ad trucks. (Both the Columbia and Cowlitz and the Chehalis Western are Weyerhaeuser properties)
*Monongahela Connecting Railroad bought a single low cab unit with Hi-Ad trucks.
*Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad bought ten medium cab units with AAR Type B trucks.
*Southern Pacific Railroad bought ten high cab units with Type B road trucks.
*Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway bought two medium cab units with Hi-Ad trucks; these were passed to the Burlington Northern Railroad, 4010-4011 after a merger between the two railroads. More units were on order when Alco ended locomotive production in 1969.

==Preservation==
*Southern Pacific Railroad 2406 is in Monterrey, Mexico, lettered as Fundidora Monterrey Steel 25.
*Hamersley Iron 1000, formerly Alco Demonstrator 415 is at the Pilbara Railways Historical Society in Western Australia.
*Monongahela Connecting Railroad 701 is at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.
*Chehalis Western Railroad 684 is at Fife History Museum and Cultural Center in Fife, Washington.
*Buffalo Southern Railroad 423, formerly Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad 423 is at the Buffalo Southern&#x27;s Hamburg Shops in Hamburg, New York.

<text>The Southern Pacific (or Espee from the railroad initials) was an American Class I railroad network that existed from 1865 to 1996 and operated largely in the Western United States. The system was operated by various companies under the names Southern Pacific Railroad, Southern Pacific Company and Southern Pacific Transportation Company.

The original Southern Pacific began in 1865 as a land holding company. The last incarnation of the Southern Pacific, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, was founded in 1969 and assumed control of the Southern Pacific system. The Southern Pacific Transportation Company was acquired in 1996 by the Union Pacific Corporation and merged with their Union Pacific Railroad.

The Southern Pacific legacy founded hospitals in San Francisco, Tucson, and Houston. In the 1970s, it also founded a telecommunications network with a state-of-the-art microwave and fiber optic backbone. This telecommunications network became part of Sprint, a company whose name came from the acronym for Southern Pacific Railroad Internal Networking Telephony.

==History==

The original Southern Pacific Railroad was founded in San Francisco in 1865, by a group of businessmen led by Timothy Phelps with the aim of building a rail connection between San Francisco and San Diego, California. The company was purchased in September 1868 by a group of businessmen known as the Big Four: Charles Crocker, Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, Jr. and C. P. Huntington. The Big Four had, in 1861, created the Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) It later acquired the Central Pacific Railroad in 1885 through leasing. By 1900, the Southern Pacific system was a major railroad system incorporating many smaller companies, such as the Texas and New Orleans Railroad and Morgan&#x27;s Louisiana and Texas Railroad. It extended from New Orleans through Texas to El Paso, across New Mexico and through Tucson, to Los Angeles, through most of California, including San Francisco and Sacramento. Central Pacific lines extended east across Nevada to Ogden, Utah, and reached north through Oregon to Portland. Other subsidiaries eventually included the St. Louis Southwestern Railway (Cotton Belt, reporting marks SSW), El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, the Northwestern Pacific Railroad at , the Southern Pacific Railroad of Mexico, and a variety of narrow-gauge routes.

The company was headquartered in the Flood Building in San Francisco&#x27;s downtown shopping district in 1907. Ten years later, they moved into the historic 11-story, Southern Pacific Building, also known as &quot;The Landmark&quot;, located at One Market Street on the Embarcadero whose construction started in 1916. At its completion, the building&#x27;s first floor was devoted to retail except for the portion facing the rear courtyard (opening to Mission Street), which was reserved for Southern Pacific. SP rented the second floor to a tenant, but occupied floors three through ten with various offices. For nearly a century, the building was topped with a large sign emblazoned with a gothic &quot;S·P&quot; marking the company&#x27;s San Francisco roots.

The SP was known for its mammoth back shops at Sacramento, California, which was one of the few in the country equipped to design and build locomotives on a large scale. Sacramento was among the top ten largest shops in the US, occupying 200 acres of land with dozens of buildings and an average employment of 3,000, peaking at 7,000 during World War II. Other major shop sites were located at Ogden, Utah; Houston, Texas; and Algiers, New Orleans. After the 1906 earthquake destroyed much of San Francisco, including the SP shops there, new shops and yards were built six miles south of the city at Bayshore. The Alhambra Shops in Los Angeles consisted of 10 buildings and employed 1,500 but declined in importance when the Taylor Yard was built in 1930.

The SP was the defendant in the landmark 1886 United States Supreme Court case &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad&quot;, which is often interpreted as having established certain corporate rights under the Constitution of the United States. 

The Southern Pacific Railroad was replaced by the Southern Pacific Company and assumed the railroad operations of the Southern Pacific Railroad. In 1929, Southern Pacific/Texas and New Orleans operated 13,848 route-miles not including Cotton Belt, whose purchase of the Golden State Route circa 1980 nearly doubled its size to , bringing total SP/SSW mileage to around . The T&amp;NO was fully merged into the SP in 1961.
In 1969, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company was established and took over the Southern Pacific Company; this Southern Pacific railroad is the last incarnation and was at times called &quot;Southern Pacific Industries&quot;, though &quot;Southern Pacific Industries&quot; is not the official name of the company. By the 1980s, route mileage had dropped to , mainly due to the pruning of branch lines. On October 13, 1988, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company (including its subsidiary, St. Louis Southwestern Railway) was taken over by Rio Grande Industries, the parent company that controlled the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (reporting marks D&amp;RGW). Rio Grande Industries did not merge the Southern Pacific Transportation Company and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad together, but transferred direct ownership of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad to the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, allowing the combined Rio Grande Industries railroad system to use the Southern Pacific name due to its brand recognition in the railroad industry and with customers of both the Southern Pacific Transportation Company and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. A long time Southern Pacific subsidiary, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway was also marketed under the Southern Pacific name. Along with the addition of the SPCSL Corporation route from Chicago to St. Louis, the former mainline of the Chicago, Missouri and Western Railroad that once belonged to the Alton Railroad, the total length of the D&amp;RGW/SP/SSW system was . Rio Grande Industries was later renamed Southern Pacific Rail Corporation.

By 1996, years of financial problems had dropped Southern Pacific&#x27;s mileage to . The financial problems caused the Southern Pacific Transportation Company to be taken over by the Union Pacific Corporation; the parent Southern Pacific Rail Corporation (formerly Rio Grande Industries), the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway and the SPCSL Corporation were also taken over by the Union Pacific Corporation. The Union Pacific Corporation merged the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway and the SPCSL Corporation into their Union Pacific Railroad but did not merge the Southern Pacific Transportation Company into the Union Pacific Railroad. Instead, the Union Pacific Corporation merged the Union Pacific Railroad into the Southern Pacific Transportation Company on February 1, 1998; the Southern Pacific Transportation Company became the surviving railroad and at the same time the Union Pacific Corporation renamed the Southern Pacific Transportation Company to Union Pacific Railroad. Thus, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company became, and is still operating as, the current incarnation of the Union Pacific Railroad.

== Locomotives ==
Like most railroads, the SP painted most of its steam locomotives black during the 20th century, but after 1945 SP painted the front of the locomotive&#x27;s smokebox silver (almost white in appearance), with graphite colored sides, for visibility.

Some passenger steam locomotives bore the &quot;Daylight&quot; scheme, named after the trains they hauled, most of which had the word &quot;Daylight&quot; in the train name. The most famous &quot;Daylight&quot; locomotives were the GS-4 steam locomotives. The most famous Daylight-hauled trains were the Coast Daylight and the Sunset Limited.

Well known were the Southern Pacific&#x27;s unique &quot;cab-forward&quot; steam locomotives. These were 4-8-8-2, 2-8-8-2, and 4-6-6-2 (rebuilt from 2-6-6-2) locomotives set up to run in reverse, with the tender attached to the smokebox end of the locomotive. Southern Pacific had a number of snow sheds in mountain terrain, and locomotive crews nearly asphyxiated from smoke in the cab. After a number of engineers began running their engines in reverse (pushing the tender), Southern Pacific asked Baldwin Locomotive Works to produce cab-forward designs. No other North American railroad ordered cab-forward locomotives.

==Notable accidents==
* John Sontag, a young Southern Pacific employee, was injured c. 1888 while coupling cars in the railroad yard in Fresno. He accused the company of not providing him with medical care while he was recuperating from his on-the-job injury and then not rehiring him when he had healed. He soon turned to a life of crime (mostly train robberies) and died of gunshot wounds and tetanus in the Fresno jail in 1893 aged 32 years.

:Sontag&#x27;s partner in crime, Chris Evans also hated the Southern Pacific, which Evans accused of forcing farmers to sell their lands at reduced rates to the company.

* On 28 March 1907, the Southern Pacific &quot;Sunset Express&quot;, descending the grade out of the San Timoteo Canyon, entered the Colton rail yard traveling about , hit an open switch and careened off the track, resulting in 24 fatalities. Accounts said 9 of the train&#x27;s 14 cars disintegrated as they piled on top of one another, leaving the dead and injured in &quot;a heap of kindling and crumpled metal&quot;. Of the dead, 18 were Italian immigrants traveling to jobs in San Francisco from Genoa, Italy.
* The &quot;Coast Line Limited&quot; was heading for Los Angeles, on 22 May 1907, when it was derailed just west of Glendale, California. Passenger cars reportedly tumbled down the embankment. At least 2 people were killed and others injured. &quot;The horrible deed was planned with devilish accurateness&quot; the &quot;Pasadena Star News&quot; reported at the time. It said spikes were removed from the track and a hook placed under the end of the rail. The &quot;Star&quot;&#x27;s coverage was extensive and its editorial blasted the criminal elements behind the wreck:The man or men who committed this horrible deed near Glendale may not be anarchists, technically speaking. But if they are sane men, moved by motive, they are such stuff as anarchists are made of. If the typical anarchist conceived that a railroad corporation should be terrorized, he would not scruple to wreck a passenger train and send scores and hundreds to instant death.
* In the early hours of 1 June 1907, an attempt to derail a Southern Pacific train near Santa Clara, California, was foiled when a pile of railway ties was discovered on the tracks. A work train crew found that someone had driven a steel plate into a switch near Burbank, California, intending to derail the Santa Barbara local.
* On 12 August 1939, the westbound &quot;City of San Francisco&quot; derailed from a bridge in Palisade Canyon, between Battle Mountain and Carlin in the Nevada desert. Among the passengers and crew members 24 people were killed and many more injured, and 5 cars were destroyed. An act of sabotage was determined to be the most likely cause; however, no suspect(s) was(were) ever identified.
* On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1944 a rear-end collision west of Ogden in thick fog killed 48 people.
* On 17 January 1947, the Southern Pacific Nightflier wrecked outside of Bakersfield; 7 people were killed and over 50 injured. Four coaches and a tourist sleeper were overturned, landing far off the tracks; the other seven cars remained upright. The locomotive stayed on the tracks and its crew was uninjured. A 29-year-old passenger, Robert Crowley from Miami, Florida, had been conversing with a man across the aisle who was killed instantly. Crowley, who was a combat war veteran, said “I never saw such a mess” even on a battlefield.
* On 8 May 1948, in Monterey, California, a Southern Pacific passenger train, the &quot;Del Monte Express&quot; struck a car driven by influential marine biologist Ed Ricketts at the now defunct railroad crossing at Drake Avenue. Ricketts subsequently succumbed to his injuries three days later in the hospital.
* On 17 September 1963, a Southern Pacific freight train crashed into an illegally converted bus at a grade crossing in Chualar, California, killing 32 bracero workers. It would later be a factor in the decision by Congress in 1964 to terminate the bracero program, despite its strong support among farmers. It also helped spur the Chicano civil rights movement. As of 2014, it was the deadliest automobile accident in United States history, according to the National Safety Council
* On 28 April 1973, a Southern Pacific freight train carrying munitions exploded in Roseville Yard injuring 52 people, the cause of this was due to a hot box on a railcar setting the floor ablaze, heating a bomb until it detonated.
* On 12 May 1989, a Southern Pacific train carrying trona derailed in San Bernardino, California. The train failed to slow while descending a nearby slope, and sped up to about before derailing, causing the San Bernardino train disaster. The crash destroyed 7 homes along Duffy Street and killed 2 train workers and 2 residents. Thirteen days later on 25 May 1989, an underground pipeline running along the right-of-way ruptured and caught fire due to damage done to the pipeline during clean-up from the derailment or from the derailment itself, destroying 11 more homes and killing 2 more people.
* On the night of 14 July 1991, a Southern Pacific train derailed into the upper Sacramento River at a sharp bend of track called “the Cantara Loop”, upstream from Dunsmuir, California, in Siskiyou County. Several cars made contact with the water, including a tank car. Early in the morning of 15 July, it became apparent that the tank car had ruptured and spilled its entire contents into the river – approximately of metam sodium, a soil fumigant. Ultimately, over a million fish, and tens of thousands of amphibians and crayfish were killed. Millions of aquatic invertebrates, including insects and mollusks, which form the basis of the river&#x27;s ecosystem, were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of willows, alders, and cottonwoods eventually died; many more were severely injured.

:The chemical plume left a wake of destruction from the spill site to the entry point of the river into Shasta Lake. The accident still ranks as the largest hazardous chemical spill in California history. At the time of the incident, metam sodium was not classified as a hazardous material.

==Preserved locomotives==

There are many Southern Pacific locomotives still in revenue service with railroads such as the Union Pacific Railroad, and many older and special locomotives have been donated to parks and museums, or continue operating on scenic or tourist railroads. Most of the engines now in use with Union Pacific have been &quot;patched&quot;, where the SP logo on the front is replaced by a Union Pacific shield, and new numbers are applied over the old numbers with a Union Pacific sticker, however some engines remain in Southern Pacific &quot;bloody nose&quot; paint. Over the past couple years, most of the patched units were repainted into the full Union Pacific scheme and as of January 2019, less than ten units remain in their old paint. Among the more notable equipment is:
* 745 (Mk-5, 2-8-2), owned by the Louisiana Rail Heritage Trust, operated by the Louisiana Steam Train Association, and based in Jefferon (near New Orleans), Louisiana
*786 (Mk-5, 2-8-2), owned by the City of Austin, leased to the Austin Steam Train Association. Currently under full mechanical restoration in Austin, Texas.
*794 (Mk-5, 2-8-2), the last Mikado built for the Texas and New Orleans Railroad in 1916 out of spare parts in their Houston shops. It currently resides with cosmetic restoration at San Antonio Station, San Antonio, Texas, but plans are to restore it to operating condition.
*982 (F-1, 2-10-2), tender located at the Heber Valley Railroad in Heber City, Utah, main locomotive located in Houston, Texas.

* 4449 (GS-4, 4-8-4), formerly located at the Brooklyn Roundhouse before being relocated to the Oregon Rail Heritage Center in June 2012, Portland, Oregon
*4460 (GS-6, 4-8-4), located at the National Museum of Transportation, Kirkwood, Missouri
*5119 (GE 70-ton switcher), Operational and awaiting paint restoration to SP colors at Pacific Southwest Railway Museum in Campo, California
*7304 (ALCO RS-32), on display awaiting restoration at Pacific Southwest Railway Museum in Campo, California
*7457 (EMD SD45) the first GM Electro-Motive Division SD45 diesel-electric road switcher locomotive to be built for that railroad in 1966. It last saw service on Donner Pass. It was donated to the Utah State Railroad Museum in 2002.

== Honorary tribute ==
On August 19, 2006, UP unveiled a brand new EMD SD70ACe locomotive, Union Pacific 1996, as part of a new heritage program. It was the final unit in UP&#x27;s Heritage Series of locomotives, and was painted in a color scheme inspired by the &quot;Daylight&quot; and &quot;Black Widow&quot; schemes.

<doc id="387807" wikidata="Q420039" url="?curid=387807" title="Nonoxynol-9">
<text>Nonoxynol-9, sometimes abbreviated as N-9, is an organic compound that is used as a surfactant. It is a member of the nonoxynol family of nonionic surfactants. N-9 and related compounds are ingredients in various cleaning and cosmetic products. It is widely used in contraceptives for its spermicidal properties.

==Uses==

===Spermicide===
As a spermicide, it attacks the acrosomal membranes of the sperm, causing the sperm to be immobilized.
Nonoxynol-9 is the active ingredient in most spermicidal creams, jellies, foams, gel, film, and suppositories.

===Lubricant===
Nonoxynol-9 is a common ingredient of most vaginal and anal lubricants due to its spermicidal properties.

A 2004 study found that over a six-month period, the typical-use failure rates for five nonoxynol-9 vaginal contraceptives (film, suppository, and gels at three different concentrations) ranged from 10% to 20%.

===Condoms===
Many models of condoms are lubricated with solutions containing nonoxynol-9. In this role, it has been promoted as a backup method for avoiding pregnancy and a microbicide for sexually transmitted diseases in the event of condom failure. However, the 2001 WHO / CONRAD Technical Consultation on Nonoxynol-9 concluded that: &quot;There is no published scientific evidence that N-9-lubricated condoms provide any additional protection against pregnancy or STDs compared with condoms lubricated with other products. Since adverse effects due to the addition of N-9 to condoms cannot be excluded, such condoms should no longer be promoted. However, it is better to use N-9-lubricated condoms than no condoms.&quot;

Compared to regular lubricated condoms, condoms containing nonoxynol-9 present another disadvantage — they are limited by the shelf-life of the
spermicide. 

===Cervical barriers===
Almost all brands of diaphragm jelly contain nonoxynol-9 as the active ingredient. This jelly may also be used for a cervical cap. Most contraceptive sponges contain nonoxynol-9 as an active ingredient.

===Shaving cream===
Nonoxynol-9 is sometimes included in shaving creams for its properties as a nonionic surfactant; it helps break down skin oils that normally protect hair from moisture, so that they become wet and, hence, softer and easier to shave. Gillette formerly used nonoxynol-9 for this purpose in its Foamy products, but has discontinued the practice.

===Sports cream===
Nonoxynol-9 is also found in Bengay Vanishing Scent as an inactive ingredient.

===Poison ivy creams===
Nonoxynol-9 is also found in Zanfel poison ivy cream. It effectively helps to break up the oil urushiol that causes the rash.

==Side effects==
From 1996 to 2000, a UN-sponsored study conducted in several locations in Africa followed nearly 1,000 sex workers who used nonoxynol-9 gels or a placebo. The HIV infection rate among those using nonoxynol-9 was about 50% higher than those who used the placebo; those using nonoxynol-9 also had a higher incidence of vaginal lesions, which may have contributed to this increased risk. Whereas these results may not be directly applicable to lower-frequency use, these findings combined with lack of any demonstrated HIV-prevention benefit from nonoxynol-9 use led the World Health Organization to recommend that it no longer be used by those at high risk of HIV infection. The WHO further notes that &quot;Nonoxynol-9 offers no protection against sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea, chlamydia.&quot; A 2006 study of a nonoxynol-9 vaginal gel in female sex workers in Africa concluded that it did not prevent genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and could increase the virus&#x27;s ability to infect or persist.

<doc id="387809" wikidata="Q4717614" url="?curid=387809" title="Alex Penelas">
<text>Alexander Penelas (born December 18, 1961) is an American attorney who is the former mayor of Miami-Dade County, Florida.

==Education and personal life==
Penelas, an American of Cuban descent, attended St. Thomas University and graduated in 1981 with a degree in political science. In 1985, he received his J.D. degree from the University of Miami School of Law, where he graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; and was inducted into the university&#x27;s Iron Arrow Honor Society.

Penelas and his wife, Lilliam, have two adult sons, William and Christopher, and a younger daughter, Alexandra.

==Political life==

Alex Penelas served on the city council of Hialeah, Florida from 1987 to 1990. In 1990, he was elected to serve as a county commissioner in Dade County.

===Miami-Dade Mayor===
Penelas ran in 1996 for Mayor of Dade County, renamed Miami-Dade County in 1997. Penelas advanced to the runoff for Mayor against fellow commissioner Arthur Teele. Penelas scored 37% to Teele&#x27;s 25% with former mayor of Miami Maurice Ferre and Xavier Suarez in third and fourth. In the run-off Penelas soundly beat Teele with 60.56% to Teele&#x27;s 39.44%. Penelas ran for reelection in 2000 and beat Miami Dade Commissioner Miguel Diaz de la Portilla with 51.6% to Diaz de la Portilla&#x27;s 20.9%. Because Penelas reached the 50% threshold, a runoff was not needed.

As mayor, he vocally opposed the repatriation of Elián González in 2000, but was not successful in stopping the repatriation.

===2004 Senate campaign===

In 2004, Penelas was term-limited as mayor and ran for 2004 United States Senate election in Florida. This was the first open Senate seat since 1980, it was being vacated by longtime incumbent and Dade County native Bob Graham. Penelas finished third in the primary, behind Betty Castor and Peter Deutsch. His campaign was made more difficult when Al Gore called him &quot;the single most treacherous and dishonest person I dealt with during the 2000 presidential election campaign anywhere in America.&quot;

=== 2020 mayoral bid ===

In April 2019, Penelas announced his campaign for re-election to the office of Miami-Dade County Mayor, a position he previously occupied for eight years. Penelas initially led in most polls but finished in third in the first round behind Daniella Levine Cava and Esteban Bovo.

<text>Rob Gifford is a British radio correspondent and journalist. He has degrees in Chinese Studies from Durham University and in Regional Studies (East Asia) from Harvard University. He began to learn Mandarin Chinese in 1987 whilst in China.

Gifford was on staff at the BBC World Service for three years. In the United States, he worked for two years at WGBH in Boston. From 1999 to 2005, Gifford was the China correspondent for National Public Radio (NPR). He took leave of absence from NPR to write his first book, &quot;China Road&quot;, (2007; ), which was based on his six-week trip on National Highway 312, China&#x27;s &quot;mother road&quot; stretching from Shanghai to the Gobi Desert. Gifford initially covered this journey in a seven-part radio series for NPR&#x27;s program &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, as one of his last journalistic projects in China.

Gifford is currently the China editor of &quot;The Economist&quot; (beginning August 2011), and was previously the London bureau chief for NPR.

<text>Spermicide is a contraceptive substance that destroys sperm, inserted vaginally prior to intercourse to prevent pregnancy. As a contraceptive, spermicide may be used alone. However, the pregnancy rate experienced by couples using only spermicide is higher than that of couples using other methods. Usually, spermicides are combined with contraceptive barrier methods such as diaphragms, condoms, cervical caps, and sponges. Combined methods are believed to result in lower pregnancy rates than either method alone.

Spermicides are typically unscented, clear, unflavored, non-staining, and lubricative.

==Types and effectiveness==
The most common active ingredient of spermicides is nonoxynol-9. Spermicides containing nonoxynol-9 are available in many forms, such as jelly (gel), films, and foams. Used alone, spermicides have a perfect use failure rate of 6% per year when used correctly and consistently, and 16% failure rate per year in typical use.

Nonoxynol-9 is the primary chemical in spermicides to inhibit sperm motility. Active secondary spermicidal ingredients can include octoxynol-9, benzalkonium chloride and menfegol. These secondary ingredients are not mainstream in the United States, where nonoxynol-9 alone is typical. Preventing sperm motility will inhibit the sperm from travelling towards the egg moving down the fallopian tubes to the uterus. The deep proper insertion of spermicide should effectively block the cervix so that sperm cannot make it past the cervix to the uterus or the fallopian tubes. A study observing the distribution of spermicide containing nonoxynol-9 in the vaginal tract showed “After 10 min the gel spread within the vaginal canal providing a contiguous covering of the epithelium of variable thickness.” The sole goal of spermicide is to prevent fertilization.

Menfegol is a spermicide manufactured as a foaming tablet. It is available only in Europe.

Octoxynol-9 was previously a common spermicide, but was removed from the U.S. market in 2002 after manufacturers failed to perform new studies required by the FDA.

The spermicides benzalkonium chloride and sodium cholate are used in some contraceptive sponges. Benzalkonium chloride might also be available in Canada as a suppository.

The 2008 Ig Nobel Prize (a parody of the Nobel Prizes) in Chemistry was awarded to Sheree Umpierre, Joseph Hill, and Deborah Anderson, for discovering that Coca-Cola is an effective spermicide, and to C.Y. Hong, C.C. Shieh, P. Wu, and B.N. Chiang for proving it is not.

Lemon juice solutions have been shown to immobilize sperm in the laboratory, as has Krest Bitter Lemon drink. While the authors of the Krest Bitter Lemon study suggested its use as a postcoital douche, this is unlikely to be effective, as sperm begin leaving the ejaculate (out of the reach of any douche) within 1.5 minutes of deposition. No published studies appear to have been done on the effectiveness of lemon juice preparations in preventing pregnancy, though they are advocated by some as &#x27;natural&#x27; spermicides.

Lactic acid preparations have also been shown to have some spermicidal effect, and commercial lactic acid-based spermicides are available. A contraceptive containing lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate (Phexxi) was approved for use in the United States in May 2020.

Extractives of the neem plant such as neem oil have also been proposed as spermicides based on laboratory studies. Animal studies of creams and pessaries derived from neem have shown they have contraceptive effects; however, trials in humans to determine its effectiveness in preventing pregnancy have not yet been conducted.

==Use with condoms==
Spermicides are believed to increase the contraceptive effectiveness of condoms.

However, condoms that are spermicidally lubricated by the manufacturer have a shorter shelf life and may cause urinary tract infections in women. The World Health Organization says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted. However, they recommend using a nonoxynol-9 lubricated condom over no condom at all.

Spermicides used alone are only about 91 percent effective. When spermicides are used in conjunction with condoms and other barrier methods there is a 97 percent effective rate for pregnancy prevention.

==Side effects==
Temporary local skin irritation involving the vulva, vagina, or penis is the most common problem associated with spermicide use.

Frequent use (two times or more a day) of nonoxynol-9 containing spermicide is inadvisable if STI/HIV exposure is likely, because in this situation there is increased vulvovaginal epithelial disruption and increased risk of HIV acquisition.

In 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated that labels for nonoxynol-9 over-the-counter (OTC) contraceptive products carry a new warning saying they do not protect against STDs and HIV/AIDS.

==History==
The first written record of spermicide use is found in the Kahun Papyrus, an Egyptian document dating to 1850 BCE. It described a pessary of crocodile dung and fermented dough. It is believed that the low pH of the dung may have had a spermicidal effect.

Further formulations are found in the Ebers Papyrus from approximately 1500 BCE. It recommended mixing seed wool, acacia, dates and honey, and placing the mixture in the vagina. It probably had some effectiveness, in part as a physical barrier due to the thick, sticky consistency, and also because of the lactic acid (a known spermicide) formed from the acacia.

Writings by Soranus, a 2nd-century Greek physician, contained formulations for a number of acidic concoctions claimed to be spermicidal. His instructions were to soak wool in one of the mixtures, then place near the cervix.

Laboratory testing of substances to see if they inhibited sperm motility began in the 1800s. Modern spermicides nonoxynol-9 and menfegol were developed from this line of research. However, many other substances of dubious contraceptive value were also promoted. Especially after the prohibition of contraception in the U.S. by the 1873 Comstock Act, spermicides—the most popular of which was Lysol—were marketed only as &quot;feminine hygiene&quot; products and were not held to any standard of effectiveness. Worse, many manufacturers recommended using the products as a douche &quot;after&quot; intercourse, too late to affect all the sperm. Medical estimates during the 1930s placed the pregnancy rate of women using many over-the-counter spermicides at seventy percent per year.

A misconception about spermicides existed in the 1980s and 1990s. A 1988 literature review article noted that &quot;in vitro&quot; studies of nonoxynol-9 and other spermicides showed inactivation of STI pathogens, including HIV. But a 2002 systemic review and meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials of vaginal nonoxynol-9 for HIV and STI prevention involving more than 5,000 women (predominantly sex workers) found no statistically significant reduction in risk of HIV and STIs, but found a small statistically significant increase in genital lesions among nonoxynol-9 spermicide users. And in a high-risk population using a nonoxynol-9 vaginal gel more than three applications per day on average, the risk of HIV acquisition was increased.

<doc id="387815" wikidata="Q4983267" url="?curid=387815" title="Buckinghamshire Railway Centre">
<text>Buckinghamshire Railway Centre is a railway museum operated by the Quainton Railway Society Ltd. at Quainton Road railway station, about west of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England. The site is divided into two halves which are joined by two foot-bridges, one of which provides wheelchair access. Each side has a demonstration line with various workshop buildings as well as museum buildings.

==History==

In 1962, the London Railway Preservation Society was formed. It bought a series of former London Underground vehicles and collectables, and holds the largest collection of London and North Western Railway memorabilia. These were held at various sites around London, mainly two government depots at Luton and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, making both access, restoration and preservation difficult.

While other closed stations on the former MR lines north of were generally demolished or sold, in 1969 the Quainton Railway Society was formed to operate a working museum at the station. On 24 April 1971 the society absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking custody of its collection of historic railway equipment.

===Restoration===
The station was maintained in working order, used as a bookshop and ticket office. The extensive sidings were still intact, and although disconnected from the mainline in 1967, were used for locomotive restoration work. The Society eventually restored the main station building to its 1900 appearance, renaming the site the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre. A smaller building on the former Brill platform, once a shelter for passengers waiting for Brill and down trains, was used first as a store then as a shop for a number of years before its current use to house an exhibit on the history of the Brill Tramway. A former London Transport building from Wembley Park was dismantled and re-erected at Quainton Road to serve as a maintenance shed.

===Mainline services===
Although the BRC&#x27;s trains are run on the former station sidings, the station still has a working Network Rail line passing through it. This connects with the Bletchley to Oxford cross-country route at Claydon (LNE) Junction. Regular landfill freight trains and High Speed 2 spoil trains traverse the line from waste transfer depots in Greater London as well as some from the freight terminal at Tytherington and other freight locations in the South-West of England to the former brick pits at Calvert. The High Speed 2 trains also terminate here, but are used for the construction of the new High Speed 2 depot at Calvert.

From 1984 until 1990, the station briefly came back into passenger use, when special Christmas shopping services between Aylesbury and were operated by British Rail Network SouthEast on Saturdays only, and stopped at Quainton Road. From August Bank Holiday 1971 until the 1987 season, and again from August Bank Holiday 2001 until May 2017 the station has had special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre - these shuttles ran regularly each Spring and August Bank Holiday weekend.

==Present==
With an extensively redeveloped site on both sides of the working mainline, BRC houses around 170 items of locomotives and rolling stock, in buildings dating from 1874 to the 1960s. The adjacent World War II warehouses of the Ministry of Food Buffer Depot in the former downside yard have been taken over to display many items awaiting restoration, whilst the Society have added a members&#x27; reference library.

===Rewley Road===

Rewley Road, the Oxford terminus of Harry Verney&#x27;s Buckinghamshire Railway and of the Oxford to Cambridge Line, closed to passengers on 1 October 1951 with trains diverted to the former GWR Oxford General, the current Oxford station. In co-operation with the Science Museum, Rewley Road was dismantled in 1999. The main station building and part of the platform canopy were then moved to BRC and re-erected in 2002 at the north-west corner of the site, now providing improved visitor facilities and the main offices of the QRS.

===Media===
As one of the best-preserved period railway stations in England, Quainton Road is regularly used as a filming location for programmes such as &quot;The Jewel in the Crown&quot;, the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Black Orchid&quot;, &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; and was a recurring location for the eighth series of &quot;Taskmaster&quot;.

==Future developments==

High Speed 2&#x27;s planned route passes immediately to the west of the site, not impacting the centre directly, although it will preclude any restoration of the Brill Tramway.
==Collection==
The collection includes locomotives, carriages, and assorted rolling stock, plus a large amount of memorabilia and documents.

===Locomotives===
===Diesel multiple units===
* BR Class 115 unit 51886+59761+51889 &quot;Aylesbury College Silver Jubilee 1987&quot;

===Electric multiple units===

* Post Office Railway (London) 1930 Stock No. 803 
* London Underground CO/CP Stock unit 53028+013063+54233 
* New York City Subway car No. 1144, an R6, converted into a cafeteria for the museum.

<doc id="387816" wikidata="Q79797" url="?curid=387816" title="Armenians">
<text>Armenians (, ) are an ethnic group and nation native to the Armenian highlands of West Asia. Armenians constitute the main population of Armenia and constituted the main population of the breakaway Republic of Artsakh until the 2023 Azerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh and the subsequent flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians. There is a wide-ranging diaspora of around five million people of full or partial Armenian ancestry living outside modern Armenia. The largest Armenian populations today exist in Russia, the United States, France, Georgia, Iran, Germany, Ukraine, Lebanon, Brazil, Argentina, Syria, and Turkey. The present-day Armenian diaspora was formed mainly as a result of the Armenian genocide with the exceptions of Iran, former Soviet states, and parts of the Levant.

Armenian is an Indo-European language. It has two mutually intelligible spoken and written forms: Eastern Armenian, today spoken mainly in Armenia, Artsakh, Iran, and the former Soviet republics; and Western Armenian, used in the historical Western Armenia and, after the Armenian genocide, primarily in the Armenian diasporan communities. The unique Armenian alphabet was invented in 405 AD by Mesrop Mashtots.

Most Armenians adhere to the Armenian Apostolic Church, a non-Chalcedonian Christian church, which is also the world&#x27;s oldest national church. Christianity began to spread in Armenia soon after Jesus&#x27; death, due to the efforts of two of his apostles, St. Thaddeus and St. Bartholomew. In the early 4th century, the Kingdom of Armenia became the first state to adopt Christianity as a state religion, followed by the first pilgrimages to the Holy Land where a community established the Armenian Quarter of Old Jerusalem.

== Etymology ==

The earliest attestations of the exonym &quot;Armenia&quot; date around the 6th century BC. In his trilingual Behistun Inscription dated to 517 BC, Darius I the Great of Persia refers to &quot;Urashtu&quot; (in Babylonian) as &quot;&quot; (Old Persian: 𐎠𐎼𐎷𐎡𐎴) and &quot;Harminuya&quot; (in Elamite).
In Greek, &quot;Armenios&quot; () is attested from about the same time, perhaps the earliest reference being a fragment attributed to Hecataeus of Miletus (476 BC). Xenophon, a Greek general serving in some of the Persian expeditions, describes many aspects of Armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 BC.

Some have linked the name &quot;Armenia&quot; with the Early Bronze Age state of &quot;Armani (Armanum, Armi)&quot; or the Late Bronze Age state of &quot;Arme (Shupria)&quot;. &quot;Armini&quot;, Urartian for &quot;inhabitant of Arme&quot; or &quot;Armean country&quot;, referring to the region of Shupria, to the immediate west of Lake Van. The Arme tribe of Urartian texts may have been the Urumu, who in the 12th century BC attempted to invade Assyria from the north with their allies the Mushki and the Kaskians. The Urumu apparently settled in the vicinity of Sason, lending their name to the regions of Arme and the nearby lands of Urme and Inner Urumu. The location of the older site of Armani is a matter of debate. Some modern researchers have placed it in the same general area as Arme, near modern Samsat, and have suggested it was populated, at least partially, by an early Indo-European-speaking people. The relationship between Armani and the later Arme-Shupria, if any, is undetermined. Additionally, their connections to Armenians is inconclusive as it is not known what languages were spoken in these regions.

It has also been speculated that the land of &quot;Ermenen&quot; (located in or near &quot;Minni&quot;), mentioned by the Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III in 1446 BCE, could be a reference to Armenia.

Armenians call themselves &quot;&quot; (, pronounced [ˈhaj]; plural: հայեր, [haˈjɛɾ]). The name has traditionally been derived from &quot;Hayk&quot; (), the legendary patriarch of the Armenians and a great-great-grandson of Noah, who, according to Movses Khorenatsi (Moses of Khorene), defeated the Babylonian king Bel in 2492 BC and established his nation in the Ararat region. It is also further postulated that the name &quot;Hay&quot; comes from, or is related to, one of the two confederated, Hittite vassal states—Hayasa-Azzi (1600–1200 BC). Ultimately, &quot;Hay&quot; may derive from the Proto Indo-European words &quot;póti&quot; (meaning &quot;lord&quot; or &quot;master&quot;) or &quot;*h₂éyos&quot;/&quot;*áyos&quot; (meaning &quot;metal&quot;).

Khorenatsi wrote that the word &quot;Armenian&quot; originated from the name Armenak or Aram (the descendant of Hayk). Khorenatsi refers to both Armenia and Armenians as &quot;Hayk‘&quot; (Armenian: Հայք) (not to be confused with the aforementioned patriarch, Hayk).

== History ==
=== Origin ===


While the Armenian language is classified as an Indo-European language, its placement within the broader Indo-European language family is a matter of debate. Until fairly recently, scholars believed Armenian to be most closely related to Greek and Ancient Macedonian. Eric P. Hamp placed Armenian in the &quot;Pontic Indo-European&quot; (also called Graeco-Armenian or Helleno-Armenian) subgroup of Indo-European languages in his 2012 Indo-European family tree. There are two possible explanations, not mutually exclusive, for a common origin of the Armenian and Greek languages.
* In Hamp&#x27;s view, the homeland of the proposed Graeco-Armenian subgroup is the northeast coast of the Black Sea and its hinterlands. He assumes that they migrated from there southeast through the Caucasus with the Armenians remaining after Batumi while the pre-Greeks proceeded westward along the southern coast of the Black Sea.
* Ancient Greek historian Herodotus (writing ), suggested that Armenians migrated from Phrygia, a region that encompassed much of western and central Anatolia during the Iron Age: &quot;the Armenians were equipped like Phrygians, being Phrygian colonists&quot; (7.73) (&quot;&quot;). This statement was interpreted by later scholars as meaning that Armenians spoke a language derived from Phrygian, a poorly attested Indo-European language. However, this theory has been discredited. Ancient Greek writers believed that the Phrygians had originated in the Balkans, in an area adjoining Macedonia, from where they had emigrated to Anatolia during the Bronze Age collapse. This led later scholars to theorize that Armenians also originated in the Balkans. However, an Armenian origin in the Balkans, although once widely accepted, has been facing increased scrutiny in recent years due to discrepancies in the timeline and lack of genetic and archeological evidence. The view that Armenians are native to the South Caucasus is supported by ancient Armenian historical accounts and legends, which place the Ararat Plain as the cradle of Armenian culture, as well as modern genetic research. In fact, some scholars have suggested that the Phrygians or the apparently related Mushki people were originally from Armenia and moved westward.

Some linguists tentatively conclude that Armenian, Greek (and Phrygian) and Indo-Iranian were dialectally close to each other; within this hypothetical dialect group, Proto-Armenian was situated between Proto-Greek (centum subgroup) and Proto-Indo-Iranian (satem subgroup). This has led some scholars to propose a hypothetical Graeco-Armenian-Aryan clade within the Indo-European language family from which the Armenian, Greek, Indo-Iranian, and possibly Phrygian languages all descend. According to Kim (2018), however, there is insufficient evidence for a cladistic connection between Armenian and Greek, and common features between these two languages can be explained as a result of contact. Contact is also the most likely explanation for morphological features shared by Armenian with Indo-Iranian and Balto-Slavic languages.

It has been suggested that the Bronze Age Trialeti-Vanadzor culture and sites such as the burial complexes at Verin and Nerkin Naver are indicative of an Indo-European presence in Armenia by the end of the 3rd millennium BCE. The controversial Armenian hypothesis, put forward by some scholars, such as Thomas Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav V. Ivanov, proposes that the Indo-European homeland was around the Armenian Highland. This theory was partially confirmed by the research of geneticist David Reich (et al. 2018), among others. Similarly Grolle (et al. 2018) supports not only a homeland for Armenians on the Armenian highlands, but also that the Armenian highlands are the homeland for the &quot;pre-proto-Indo-Europeans&quot;. A large genetic study in 2022 showed that many Armenians are &quot;direct patrilineal descendants of the Yamnaya&quot;.
Genetic studies explain Armenian diversity by several mixtures of Eurasian populations that occurred between 3000 and 2000 BCE. But genetic signals of population mixture cease after 1200 BCE when Bronze Age civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean world suddenly and violently collapsed. Armenians have since remained isolated and genetic structure within the population developed ~500 years ago when Armenia was divided between the Ottomans and the Safavid Empire in Iran. A genetic study (Wang et al. 2018) supports the indigenous origin for Armenians in a region south of the Caucasus which he calls &quot;Greater Caucasus&quot;.

In the Bronze Age, several states flourished in the area of Greater Armenia, including the Hittite Empire (at the height of its power in the 14th century BCE), (Mitanni (South-Western historical Armenia, 1500–1300 BCE), and Hayasa-Azzi (1500–1200 BCE). Soon after Hayasa-Azzi came Arme-Shupria (1300s–1190 BCE), the Nairi Confederation (1200–900 BCE), and the Kingdom of Urartu (860–590 BCE), who successively established their sovereignty over the Armenian Highland. Each of the aforementioned nations and tribes participated in the ethnogenesis of the Armenian people. Under Ashurbanipal (669–627 BCE), the Assyrian empire reached the Caucasus Mountains (modern Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan).

Luwianologist John D. Hawkins proposed that &quot;Hai&quot; people were possibly mentioned in the 10th century BCE Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions from Carchemish. A.E. Redgate later clarified that these &quot;Hai&quot; people may have been Armenians.

=== Antiquity ===

The first geographical entity that was called Armenia by neighboring peoples (such as by Hecataeus of Miletus and on the Achaemenid Behistun Inscription) was the Satrapy of Armenia, established in the late 6th century BCE under the Orontid (Yervanduni) dynasty within the Achaemenid Persian Empire. The Orontids later ruled the independent Kingdom of Armenia. At its zenith (95–65 BCE), under the imperial reign of Tigran the Great, a member of the Artaxiad (Artashesian) dynasty, the Kingdom of Armenia extended from the Caucasus all the way to what is now central Turkey, Lebanon, and northern Iran.

The Arsacid Kingdom of Armenia, itself a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia, was the first state to adopt Christianity as its religion (it had formerly been adherent to Armenian paganism, which was influenced by Zoroastrianism, while later on adopting a few elements regarding identification of its pantheon with Greco-Roman deities). In the early years of the 4th century, likely 301 CE, partly in defiance of the Sassanids it seems. In the late Parthian period, Armenia was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land, but by the Christianisation, previously predominant Zoroastrianism and paganism in Armenia gradually declined. This is the period that an Armenian community was established in Judea (modern-day Palestine-Israel), leading to the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. Later on, to further strengthen Armenian national identity, Mesrop Mashtots invented the Armenian alphabet, in 405 CE. This event ushered the Golden Age of Armenia, during which many foreign books and manuscripts were translated to Armenian by Mesrop&#x27;s pupils. Armenia lost its sovereignty again in 428 CE to the rivaling Byzantine and Sassanid Persian empires, until the Muslim conquest of Persia overran also the regions in which Armenians lived.

=== Middle Ages ===

In 885 CE the Armenians reestablished themselves as a sovereign kingdom under the leadership of Ashot I of the Bagratid Dynasty. A considerable portion of the Armenian nobility and peasantry fled the Byzantine occupation of Bagratid Armenia in 1045, and the subsequent invasion of the region by Seljuk Turks in 1064. They settled in large numbers in Cilicia, an Anatolian region where Armenians were already established as a minority since Roman times. In 1080, they founded an independent Armenian Principality then Kingdom of Cilicia, which became the focus of Armenian nationalism. The Armenians developed close social, cultural, military, and religious ties with nearby Crusader States, but eventually succumbed to Mamluk invasions. In the next few centuries, Djenghis Khan, Timurids, and the tribal Turkic federations of the Ak Koyunlu and the Kara Koyunlu ruled over the Armenians.

=== Early modern history ===
From the early 16th century, both Western Armenia and Eastern Armenia fell under Iranian Safavid rule. Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian geo-political rivalry that would last in Western Asia, significant parts of the region were frequently fought over between the two rivalling empires. From the mid 16th century with the Peace of Amasya, and decisively from the first half of the 17th century with the Treaty of Zuhab until the first half of the 19th century, Eastern Armenia was ruled by the successive Iranian Safavid, Afsharid and Qajar empires, while Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule. In the late 1820s, the parts of historic Armenia under Iranian control centering on Yerevan and Lake Sevan (all of Eastern Armenia) were incorporated into the Russian Empire following Iran&#x27;s forced ceding of the territories after its loss in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828) and the outcoming Treaty of Turkmenchay. Western Armenia however, remained in Ottoman hands.

=== Modern history ===
The ethnic cleansing of Armenians during the final years of the Ottoman Empire is widely considered a genocide, resulting in an estimated 1.2 million victims. The first wave of persecution was in the years 1894 to 1896, the second one culminating in the events of the Armenian genocide in 1915 and 1916. With World War I in progress, the Ottoman Empire accused the (Christian) Armenians as liable to ally with Imperial Russia, and used it as a pretext to deal with the entire Armenian population as an enemy within their empire.

Governments of the Republic of Turkey since that time have consistently rejected charges of genocide, typically arguing either that those Armenians who died were simply in the way of a war, or that killings of Armenians were justified by their individual or collective support for the enemies of the Ottoman Empire. Passage of legislation in various foreign countries, condemning the persecution of the Armenians as genocide, has often provoked diplomatic conflict. (See recognition of the Armenian genocide)

Following the breakup of the Russian Empire in the aftermath of World War I for a brief period, from 1918 to 1920, Armenia was an independent republic plagued by socio-economic crises such as large-scale Muslim uprisings. In late 1920, the communists came to power following an invasion of Armenia by the Red Army; in 1922, Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian SFSR of the Soviet Union, later on forming the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (1936 to 21 September 1991). In 1991, Armenia declared independence from the USSR and established the second Republic of Armenia. Also in 1991, the ethnic Armenian-majority Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (later the Republic of Artsakh), declared independence from Azerbaijan which lasted until 2023.

== Geographic distribution ==
=== Armenia ===

Armenians are believed to have had a presence in the Armenian Highland for over 4,000 years. According to legend, Hayk, the patriarch and founder of the Armenian nation, led Armenians to victory over Bel of Babylon and settled in the Armenian Highland. Today, with a population of 3.5 million (although more recent estimates place the population closer to 2.9 million), they constitute an overwhelming majority in Armenia, Armenians in the diaspora informally refer to them as &quot;Hayastantsi&quot;s (), meaning those that are from Armenia (that is, those born and raised in Armenia). They, as well as the Armenians of Iran and Russia, speak the Eastern dialect of the Armenian language. The country itself is secular as a result of Soviet domination, but most of its citizens identify themselves as Apostolic Armenian Christian.

=== Diaspora ===

While the largest Armenian diaspora populations reside in Russia, the United States, France, and other countries, small Armenian trading and religious communities have existed outside Armenia for centuries. A prominent community has continued since the 4th century in the Holy Land, and one of the quarters of the walled Old City of Jerusalem is called the Armenian Quarter. An Armenian Catholic monastic community of 35 founded in 1717 exists on an island near Venice, Italy.

The region of Western Armenia was an influential part of the Eastern Roman Empire, which was absorbed by the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century. The Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire is estimated to have been between 1.5 and 2.5 million in the early 20th century. Most of the modern Armenian diaspora consists of Armenians scattered throughout the world as a direct consequence of massacres and genocide in the Ottoman Empire. However, Armenian communities in Iran, Georgia (Tbilisi), and Syria existed since antiquity. During the Middle Ages and the centuries prior to the genocide, additional communities were formed in Greece, Bulgaria, Hungary, Kievan Rus&#x27; and the territories of Russia, Poland, Austria, and Lebanon. There are also remnants of historic communities in Turkey (Istanbul), India, Myanmar, Thailand, Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, Italy, Israel-Palestine, Iraq, Romania, Serbia, Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.

The Nagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaijan had an absolute Armenian majority until 2023. From 1991 to 2023, the region was governed by the Armenia-backed Republic of Artsakh, a largely unrecognized breakway state. After Azerbaijan defeated Artsakh in 2023 after decades of conflict, nearly the entire population fled into Armenia.

Within the diasporan Armenian community, there is an unofficial classification of the different &quot;kinds&quot; of Armenians. For example, Armenians who originate from Iran are referred to as &quot;Parskahay&quot; (), while Armenians from Lebanon are usually referred to as &quot;Lipananahay&quot; (). Armenians of the Diaspora are the primary speakers of the Western dialect of the Armenian language. This dialect has considerable differences with Eastern Armenian, but speakers of either of the two variations can usually understand each other. Eastern Armenian in the diaspora is primarily spoken in Iran and European countries such as Ukraine, Russia, and Georgia (where they form a majority in the Samtskhe-Javakheti province). In diverse communities (such as in the United States and Canada) where many different kinds of Armenians live together, there is a tendency for the different groups to cluster together.

== Culture ==
=== Religion ===

Before Christianity, Armenians adhered to Armenian Indo-European native religion: a type of indigenous polytheism that pre-dated the Urartu period but which subsequently adopted several Greco-Roman and Iranian religious characteristics.

In 301 AD, Armenia adopted Christianity as a state religion, becoming the first state to do so. The claim is primarily based on the fifth-century work of Agathangelos titled &quot;The History of the Armenians.&quot; Agathangelos witnessed at first hand the baptism of the Armenian King Trdat III (c. 301/314 A.D.) by St. Gregory the Illuminator. Trdat III decreed Christianity was the state religion.

Armenia established a Church that still exists independently of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox churches, having become so in 451 AD as a result of its stance regarding the Council of Chalcedon. Today this church is known as the Armenian Apostolic Church, which is a part of the Oriental Orthodox communion, not to be confused with the Eastern Orthodox communion. During its later political eclipses, Armenia depended on the church to preserve and protect its unique identity. The original location of the Armenian Catholicosate is Echmiadzin. However, the continuous upheavals, which characterized the political scenes of Armenia, made the political power move to safer places. The Church center moved as well to different locations together with the political authority. Therefore, it eventually moved to Cilicia as the Holy See of Cilicia.
Armenia has, at times, constituted a Christian &quot;island&quot; in a mostly Muslim region. There are, however, a minority of ethnic Armenian Muslims, known as Hamshenis and Crypto-Armenians, although the former are often regarded as a distinct group or subgroup. In the late tsarist Caucasus, individual conversions of Muslims, Yazidis, Jews, and Assyrians into Armenian Christianity have been documented. The history of the Jews in Armenia dates back over 2,000 years. The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia had close ties to European Crusader States. Later on, the deteriorating situation in the region led the bishops of Armenia to elect a Catholicos in Etchmiadzin, the original seat of the Catholicosate. In 1441, a new Catholicos was elected in Etchmiadzin in the person of Kirakos Virapetsi, while Krikor Moussapegiants preserved his title as Catholicos of Cilicia. Therefore, since 1441, there have been two Catholicosates in the Armenian Church with equal rights and privileges, and with their respective jurisdictions. The primacy of honor of the Catholicosate of Etchmiadzin has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of Cilicia.
While the Armenian Apostolic Church remains the most prominent church in the Armenian community throughout the world, Armenians (especially in the diaspora) subscribe to any number of other Christian denominations. These include the Armenian Catholic Church (which follows its own liturgy but recognizes the Roman Catholic Pope), the Armenian Evangelical Church, which started as a reformation in the Mother church but later broke away, and the Armenian Brotherhood Church, which was born in the Armenian Evangelical Church, but later broke apart from it. There are other numerous Armenian churches belonging to Protestant denominations of all kinds.

Through the ages many Armenians have collectively belonged to other faiths or Christian movements, including the Paulicians which is a form of Gnostic and Manichaean Christianity. Paulicians sought to restore the pure Christianity of Paul and in c.660 founded the first congregation in Kibossa, Armenia.

Another example is the Tondrakians, who flourished in medieval Armenia between the early 9th century and 11th century. Tondrakians advocated the abolishment of the church, denied the immortality of the soul, did not believe in an afterlife, supported property rights for peasants, and equality between men and women.

The Orthodox Armenians or the Chalcedonian Armenians in the Byzantine Empire were called Iberians (&quot;Georgians&quot;) or &quot;Greeks&quot;. A notable Orthodox &quot;Iberian&quot; Armenian was the Byzantine General Gregory Pakourianos. The descendants of these Orthodox and Chalcedonic Armenians are the Hayhurum of Greece and Catholic Armenians of Georgia.

=== Language and literature ===
Armenian is a sub-branch of the Indo-European family, and with some 8 million speakers one of the smallest surviving branches, comparable to Albanian or the somewhat more widely spoken Greek, with which it may be connected (see Graeco-Armenian). Today, that branch has just one language – Armenian.

Five million Eastern Armenian speakers live in the Caucasus, Russia, and Iran, and approximately two to three million people in the rest of the Armenian diaspora speak Western Armenian. According to US Census figures, there are 300,000 Americans who speak Armenian at home. It is in fact the twentieth most commonly spoken language in the United States, having slightly fewer speakers than Haitian Creole, and slightly more than Navajo.
Armenian literature dates back to 400 AD, when Mesrop Mashtots first invented the Armenian alphabet. This period of time is often viewed as the Golden Age of Armenian literature. Early Armenian literature was written by the &quot;father of Armenian history&quot;, Moses of Chorene, who authored &quot;The History of Armenia&quot;. The book covers the time-frame from the formation of the Armenian people to the fifth century AD. The nineteenth century beheld a great literary movement that was to give rise to modern Armenian literature. This period of time, during which Armenian culture flourished, is known as the Revival period (Zartonki sherchan). The Revivalist authors of Constantinople and Tiflis, almost identical to the Romanticists of Europe, were interested in encouraging Armenian nationalism. Most of them adopted the newly created Eastern or Western variants of the Armenian language depending on the targeted audience, and preferred them over classical Armenian (grabar). This period ended after the Hamidian massacres, when Armenians experienced turbulent times. As Armenian history of the 1920s and of the Genocide came to be more openly discussed, writers like Paruyr Sevak, Gevork Emin, Silva Kaputikyan and Hovhannes Shiraz began a new era of literature.

=== Architecture ===

The first Armenian churches were built on the orders of St. Gregory the Illuminator, and were often built on top of pagan temples, and imitated some aspects of Armenian pre-Christian architecture.
Classical and Medieval Armenian Architecture is divided into four separate periods.
The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th century, beginning when Armenia converted to Christianity, and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia. The early churches were mostly simple basilicas, but some with side apses. By the fifth century the typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used. By the seventh century, centrally planned churches had been built and a more complicated &quot;niched buttress&quot; and radiating &quot;Hrip&#x27;simé&quot; style had formed. By the time of the Arab invasion, most of what we now know as classical Armenian architecture had formed.

From the 9th to 11th century, Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage of the Bagratid Dynasty with a great deal of building done in the area of Lake Van, this included both traditional styles and new innovations. Ornately carved Armenian Khachkars were developed during this time. Many new cities and churches were built during this time, including a new capital at Lake Van and a new Cathedral on Akdamar Island to match. The Cathedral of Ani was also completed during this dynasty. It was during this time that the first major monasteries, such as Haghpat and Haritchavank were built. This period was ended by the Seljuk invasion.

=== Sports ===
Many types of sports are played in Armenia, among the most popular being football, chess, boxing, basketball, ice hockey, sambo, wrestling, weightlifting, and volleyball. Since independence, the Armenian government has been actively rebuilding its sports program in the country.

During Soviet rule, Armenian athletes rose to prominence winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions. The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by Hrant Shahinyan, who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. To highlight the level of success of Armenians in the Olympics, Shahinyan was quoted as saying:

&quot;Armenian sportsmen had to outdo their opponents by several notches for the shot at being accepted into any Soviet team. But those difficulties notwithstanding, 90 percent of Armenian athletes on Soviet Olympic teams came back with medals.&quot;

In football, their most successful team was Yerevan&#x27;s FC Ararat, which had claimed most of the Soviet championships in the 70s and had also gone to post victories against professional clubs like FC Bayern Munich in the Euro cup. Notable players include Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Youri Djorkaeff, Alain Boghossian, Andranik Eskandarian, Andranik Teymourian, Edgar Manucharyan, Khoren Oganesian and Nikita Simonyan.

Armenians have also been successful in chess, which is the most popular mind sport in Armenia. Some of the most prominent chess players in the world are Armenian such as Tigran Petrosian and Levon Aronian. Garry Kasparov is half-Armenian through his mother. As a nation, Armenia won the World Champion in 2011 and the World Chess Olympiad on three occasions.

Armenians have also been successful in weightlifting and wrestling, the latter having been a successful sport in the Olympics for Armenia. At the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Armen Nazaryan won the gold in the Men&#x27;s Greco-Roman Flyweight (52 kg) category and Armen Mkrtchyan won the silver in Men&#x27;s Freestyle Paperweight (48 kg) category, securing Armenia&#x27;s first two medals in its Olympic history. There are also successful Armenians in boxing: Arthur Abraham and Vic Darchinyan.

=== Music and dance ===
Armenian music is a mix of indigenous folk music, perhaps best-represented by Djivan Gasparyan&#x27;s well-known duduk music, as well as light pop, and extensive Christian music.

Instruments like the duduk, the dhol, the zurna and the kanun are commonly found in Armenian folk music. Artists such as Sayat Nova are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music. One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the Armenian chant which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. While under Soviet rule, Armenian classical music composer Aram Khatchaturian became internationally well known for his music, for various ballets and the Sabre Dance from his composition for the ballet Gayane.

The Armenian genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called &quot;kef&quot; style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of Western Armenia, and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated. Richard Hagopian is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional &quot;kef&quot; style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 40s and 50s for developing their own style of &quot;kef music&quot; heavily influenced by the popular American Big Band Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 60s and 70s with artists such as Adiss Harmandian and Harout Pamboukjian performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia. Also with artists such as Sirusho, performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today&#x27;s entertainment industry. Other Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned French-Armenian singer and composer Charles Aznavour, pianist Sahan Arzruni, prominent opera sopranos such as Hasmik Papian and more recently Isabel Bayrakdarian and Anna Kasyan. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band System of a Down (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star Cher (whose father was Armenian). Ruben Hakobyan (Ruben Sasuntsi) is a well recognized Armenian ethnographic and patriotic folk singer who has achieved widespread national recognition due to his devotion to Armenian folk music and exceptional talent. In the Armenian diaspora, Armenian Revolutionary Songs are popular with the youth. These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes.

=== Carpet weaving ===
Carpet-weaving is historically a major traditional profession for the majority of Armenian women, including many Armenian families. Prominent Karabakh carpet weavers there were men too. The oldest extant Armenian carpet from the region, referred to as Artsakh (see also Karabakh carpet) during the medieval era, is from the village of Banants (near Gandzak) and dates to the early 13th century. The first time that the Armenian word for carpet, &quot;kork&quot;, was used in historical sources was in a 1242–1243 Armenian inscription on the wall of the Kaptavan Church in Artsakh.

Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles. They were diverse in style, rich in color and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as &quot;artsvagorgs&quot; (eagle-carpets), &quot;vishapagorgs&quot; (dragon-carpets) and &quot;otsagorgs&quot; (serpent-carpets). The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, &quot;covered with vegatative ornaments&quot;, and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh.

The art of carpet weaving was in addition intimately connected to the making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by Kirakos Gandzaketsi, a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.

Armenian carpets were also renowned by foreigners who traveled to Artsakh; the Arab geographer and historian Al-Masudi noted that, among other works of art, he had never seen such carpets elsewhere in his life.

=== Cuisine ===
Khorovats, an Armenian-styled barbecue, is arguably the favorite Armenian dish. Lavash is a very popular Armenian flat bread, and Armenian paklava is a popular dessert made from filo dough. Other famous Armenian foods include the kabob (a skewer of marinated roasted meat and vegetables), various dolmas (minced lamb, or beef meat and rice wrapped in grape leaves, cabbage leaves, or stuffed into hollowed vegetables), and pilaf, a rice dish. Also, ghapama, a rice-stuffed pumpkin dish, and many different salads are popular in Armenian culture. Fruits play a large part in the Armenian diet. Apricots (&quot;Prunus armeniaca&quot;, also known as Armenian Plum) have been grown in Armenia for centuries and have a reputation for having an especially good flavor. Peaches are popular as well, as are grapes, figs, pomegranates, and melons. Preserves are made from many fruits, including cornelian cherries, young walnuts, sea buckthorn, mulberries, sour cherries, and many others.

<text>Skiffy is a deliberate humorous misspelling or mispronunciation of the controversial term &quot;sci-fi&quot;, a neologism referring to science fiction.

==Background==

The term &quot;sci-fi&quot; was suggested as an abbreviated term for &quot;science fiction&quot; by Forrest J Ackerman in 1954, an analogy to the then-cutting edge term &quot;hi-fi&quot; (for audio high fidelity). Ackerman was a long-time fan, and at the time was the literary agent for science fiction authors Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, A. E. van Vogt, Curt Siodmak and L. Ron Hubbard. Ackerman pronounced his new term as or &quot;sigh figh&quot;. In the 1970s, some members of science fiction fandom began to pronounce the term or &quot;skiffy&quot; for unclear reasons.

Peter Nicholls writes that &quot;SF&quot; (or &quot;sf&quot;) is &quot;the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers.&quot; David Langford&#x27;s monthly fanzine &quot;Ansible&quot; includes a regular section &quot;As Others See Us&quot; which offers numerous examples of &quot;sci-fi&quot; and &quot;skiffy&quot; being used in a pejorative sense by people outside the genre.

Skiffy is the name of the science fiction and fantasy club at the College of William &amp; Mary, and VCU, as well as not always affectionate shorthand for the American cable channel once named the Sci-Fi Channel.

In 1998, Mike Resnick and Patrick Nielsen Hayden released a book called &quot;Alternate Skiffy&quot;. In keeping with the tongue-in-cheek intent of the term, this was an anthology featuring stories about what might have happened if the lives of various well-known science fiction writers had turned out differently.

<doc id="387823" wikidata="Q1715583" url="?curid=387823" title="The McLaughlin Group">
<text>The McLaughlin Group is a syndicated half-hour weekly public affairs talk show television program in the United States, hosted by John McLaughlin from 1982 until his death in 2016. Prompted by the host, the group of four pundits discussed current political issues in a round table format. A revival reuniting the regular panelists aired intermittently between 2018 and 2020.

==Format==
The general format for the show consisted of moderator John McLaughin questioning four commentators, among them Pat Buchanan, Eleanor Clift, Clarence Page, Morton Kondracke, Fred Barnes, Jack Germond and Mort Zuckerman. Members of the regular panel varied over the years.

A typical episode covered three or four issues. The first was introduced by McLaughlin, beginning with, &quot;Issue one...&quot; which was explained by him, usually in a prerecorded video segment accompanied by his voice-over. He then proposed a question for the panelists, starting with Buchanan (if present). The conversation was usually sedate at the beginning of the program, but as opposing viewpoints emerged there was more verbal rough-housing, good-natured gamesmanship and occasionally very loud crosstalk as panelists attempted to out-yell the others, all of which were the show&#x27;s trademarks.

Two episodes at the turn of the calendar year were reserved for &quot;&quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; Year-End Awards&quot;. Each panelist announced his or her choice for each category such as “Biggest Winner of 2008,” ”Best Politician,” “Most Boring,” “Turncoat of the Year,” “Enough Already,” “Most Underrated,” &quot;etc.&quot;, followed by McLaughlin&#x27;s choice. During the first of these special episodes, the participants typically dressed in festive Christmas attire; in the second, they typically dressed in formal evening wear for the New Year.

On March 11, 2011, &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; began broadcasting in high definition, with broadcasts presented in letterboxed and pillarboxed format for viewers with standard-definition television sets watching either through cable or satellite television. The program remained the set, while upconverted its existing graphics package to HD.

==Criticism==
Journalists James Fallows and ex-&quot;McLaughlin Group&quot; panelist Jack Germond opined that the show gloried too much in sensationalism and simplification, to the detriment of serious journalism. Ronald Reagan, while in office as U.S. president, once referred to McLaughlin and his group as taking the traditional Sunday morning talk show format of a moderator with a group of journalists and turning it into &quot;a political version of &quot;Animal House&quot;.&quot;

Despite the president&#x27;s remark, Christopher Hitchens wrote in 1987 that &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; was firmly aligned with the Reagan administration. Not only did it accept all sorts of preconditions for access to official guests (servitude Hitchens attributed to all major political talk shows of the time), it actively assisted the White House – McLaughlin&#x27;s wife Ann served in the cabinet, and Pat Buchanan was &quot;hired straight off the set&quot; to be Reagan&#x27;s director of communications. As for McLaughlin himself, Hitchens said, &quot;he likes to canvass all opinions from the extreme right to the moderate right&quot;.

==Syndication==
The original incarnation aired on PBS member TV stations and the PBS digital subchannel &quot;World&quot; as well as on some local commercial TV stations, including WCBS-TV in New York City. During its run, underwriters included Pfizer, the New York Stock Exchange, and GE (the longest-serving, which spent 16 years).

The show was distributed by Chicago-based PBS member station WTTW. In the United States, it was carried on numerous public broadcasting stations and, from May 2007 to August 2016, a small number of CBS-affiliated stations.
Most stations carried the program on weekends, but there were a few, like WGBH in Boston, Kentucky Educational Television stations across Kentucky, Mississippi ETV in Jackson, Mississippi, PBS channel 8 KUHT in Houston, Texas, WGVU Channel 35/WGVK Channel 52 Grand Rapids/Kalamazoo, Michigan, and PBS channel 28 KBTC in Tacoma, Washington, that ran it on Friday evenings, and WHUT-TV Channel 32 in Washington, D.C., aired it on Tuesdays. Internationally, the show was carried on several satellite channels, such as Voice of America TV and it was on the London-based CNBC Europe. It was also carried by CTV in Christchurch, New Zealand, and by Triangle TV in Auckland, New Zealand.

From its start until May 2008, the program originated from WRC-TV, the NBC-owned station in Washington, D.C. From May 2008 until it ended in August 2016, the show was produced at and aired by WUSA-TV, the Tegna-owned CBS affiliate for Washington, D.C.

==Final episode==
In the final months of the show&#x27;s run, McLaughlin took a smaller role in the panel&#x27;s weekly discussions due to health issues and a wavering voice. &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; recorded its last episode on August 12, 2016 without him on camera. It was the only episode he missed in the original run&#x27;s 34-year history, although his voice introduced the week&#x27;s issues via pre-recorded voiceovers. The episode began with a written statement from McLaughlin, which read:

Panelist Pat Buchanan then began the episode by saying, &quot;This is our first time in 34 years that our distinguished leader Dr. McLaughlin is not in his chair and we miss him. But let&#x27;s get on with the show.&quot; Buchanan, Eleanor Clift, Clarence Page, and Tom Rogan recorded the show without a moderator. Rogan closed the episode by saying, &quot;On behalf of the panel, we want to say to John that we&#x27;re thinking of you and you have our very best.&quot;

Four days after the recording of the last episode, John McLaughlin died at the age of 89 on August 16, 2016. On August 18, 2016, WTTW&#x27;s chief content officer Dan Soles announced that &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; had ended production. He told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; in a statement, &quot;This long-running political commentary and discussion show was consistently an audience favorite, and we will miss this important contribution to our political coverage. WTTW is proud to have brought the series, and Dr. McLaughlin, to the PBS system.&quot;

==Revival==
The program was revived January 7, 2018 – retaining McLaughlin&#x27;s name posthumously – reuniting the same panelists from the later years of the original run, joined by Tom Rogan as host.

Airing on WJLA-TV in Washington, D.C. during its first few months, and then available only online through December 30, 2018. The revival went into hiatus from January 4, 2019 through August 30, 2019, but returned to the air on Maryland Public Television on September 6, 2019. The show began airing nationally on PBS in the United States on January 3, 2020. It again went into hiatus after its broadcast of December 25, 2020.

=== WJLA-TV ===
In a chance meeting with Eleanor Clift in March 2017, BL Media Group chief executive officer Seth Berenzweig proposed a revival of &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot;. Although Clift initially opposed the idea, arguing that the show could not go on without McLaughlin as host, she became more positive about the proposal after meeting with Berenzweig, Clarence Page, Pat Buchanan, &quot;McLaughlin Group&quot; producer and director Shelly Schwartz, and BL Media Group president Tod Castleberry. They decided to offer Tom Rogan the position of host of the revived show, and he accepted.

On August 12, 2017, a pilot episode for a revived &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; appeared on YouTube. The panelists were Buchanan, Clift, Page, and former Central Intelligence Agency officer and 2016 presidential candidate Evan McMullin. Rogan served as the host of the program. According to Buchanan&#x27;s official website, the panelists were hoping to sell the revived show to a network so that &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; could be &quot;back on the air on a full-time basis.&quot;

Berenzweig and Castleberry believed that a revived &quot;McLaughlin Group&quot; could not survive commercially as merely a regional show in the Washington, D.C., area and needed national distribution to be financially viable. At the time the pilot appeared on YouTube, Sinclair Broadcast Group was trying to acquire Tribune Media, and Berenzweig and Castleberry approached WJLA-TV, the Sinclair-owned ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C., about a deal to carry the revived show locally. Based on the YouTube pilot, BL Media Group and WJLA-TV agreed to a deal, with the expectation that the merger of Sinclair and Tribune would go through as expected and lead to national distribution of &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; not long after its WJLA-TV debut. On December 22, 2017, it was announced that the program would return in 2018 with Rogan as host and longtime panelists Buchanan, Clift, and Page also set to return. The new version of &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; premiered on January 7, 2018, airing only on WJLA-TV. It was broadcast on Sundays at noon Eastern Time, with its episodes also available online. Sinclair Broadcasting expressed hopes to syndicate the show during the 2018–19 television season, most likely in a news block also featuring &quot;Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson&quot;.

The proposed Sinclair-Tribune merger came under scrutiny by the Federal Communications Commission, and within three months Tribune Media decided to pull out of the potential deal. Without the merger, there was no chance of national distribution of &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; via Sinclair alone, so BL Media Group opted not to renew its contract with WJLA-TV and parted company amicably with the station. As a result, after a few months, &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; ceased to air on WJLA-TV and became available online only. After it revived the original program&#x27;s two-part end-of-year annual &quot;awards&quot; show in its episodes of December 23 and 30, 2018, the new show went into hiatus. With &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; having no prospect of national distribution at the time, BL Media Group believed that it was unlikely to survive.

===Maryland Public Television===
From January 4, 2019 to August 30, 2019, &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; web site featured a banner that said: &quot;Exciting news coming soon for McLaughlin Group fans! We are taking a brief hiatus on-air and will have a major announcement coming soon. &#x27;The American Original&#x27; for over three decades, the sharpest minds, best sources and hardest talk will be bigger and better in 2019. Thanks for your support and stay tuned right here and on our social media for the latest.&quot; Meanwhile, BL Media Group decided that public television offered the best chance of resurrecting the revived show and approached several PBS stations during 2019 about carrying it. Ultimately, they chose Maryland Public Television (MPT) because of MPT&#x27;s mutual familiarity with BL Media Group, proximity to Washington, D.C., and willingness to promote &quot;The McLauglin Group&quot; as a marquee show.

In August 2019, a redesigned version of the web site announced that the show would return to the air on MPT and would premiere there on September 6, 2019, again moderated by Rogan and with Buchanan, Clift, and Page returning as regular panelists. A redesigned opening title sequence in high definition (the previous opening was letterboxed), featuring a caricature drawing of McLaughlin before the new logo, was added.

On August 12, 2019, MPT and &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; production company, Re-Group Media, LLC, announced an agreement under which the show was recorded on Fridays at a studio in Washington, D.C., and aired on MPT on Fridays at 11:30 p.m. Eastern Time and again on Saturdays at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time; the most recent episode became available online at 12:00 noon Eastern Time on Sunday. Telecasts began on September 6, 2019, with a new logo and set but otherwise retaining the format of the 2018 revival. MPT produced, marketed, promoted, and distributed the program nationally through an agreement with American Public Television, with plans to begin national distribution in January 2020. On January 3, 2020, the program began to air nationally in the United States, exclusively on PBS stations and digital platforms.

&quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; also produced a &quot;Web Exclusive&quot; each week. Available on the show&#x27;s web site, each &quot;Web Exclusive&quot; was a continuation of that week&#x27;s episode in which the panelists discuss an additional topic using footage not included in the broadcast. The first &quot;Web Exclusive&quot; was recorded as a continuation of the television episode of November 1, 2019.

On November 1, 2019, Westwood One began to produce the show for its podcast network. During the weekend of the show premiered around the United States on the Westwood One radio network.

By early March 2020, &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; aired on 204 television stations around the United States, reaching 60 percent of the American population, including outlets in 14 of the top 25 U.S. television markets, among them Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. At the time, an expanded one-hour version of the show aired on 40 radio stations around the United States through Westwood One, in addition to the Westwood One-produced podcast version of the show.

In the revived &quot;McLaughlin Group&quot;, the panel sought a calmer tone from that fostered by McLaughlin during his years as host, adopting a more conversational style with less shouting and crosstalk and no demands by the host for one-word answers to questions. As host, Rogan also took on a different persona and approach from McLaughlin, weaving his opinions into conversations rather than barking them out at panelists. Reflecting this new tone, the revived show adopted the slogan &quot;Where friends disagree, agreeably.&quot;

When public health restrictions to address the COVID-19 pandemic became widespread and commonplace in the United States in March 2020, &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; stopped taping episodes in a studio and moved to a format in which members of the panel participated remotely. This format continued through the broadcast of December 25, 2020.

After the two-part annual end-of-year &quot;awards&quot; show was broadcast in the episodes of December 18 and 25, 2020, &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; again ceased to air on television or post episodes or &quot;Web Exclusives&quot; on its Web site. On January 8, 2021, the show&#x27;s Twitter feed posted a message that stated &quot;As we kick-off the new year, The McLaughlin Group and its producers would like to thank all of our loyal viewers and listeners. We are taking a brief hiatus as we work with our broadcast partners to continue to bring to you this landmark and vital show during this important time in our country.&quot; An identical message appeared on the show&#x27;s Web page, from which all other content disappeared. During the second half of June 2022, the Web page disappeared, and , both the show&#x27;s website and Facebook page are permanently offline.

<text>The cervical cap is a form of barrier contraception. A cervical cap fits over the cervix and blocks sperm from entering the uterus through the external orifice of the uterus, called the &quot;os&quot;.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;cervical cap&quot; has been used to refer to a number of barrier contraceptives, including the Prentif, Dumas, Vimule, and Oves devices. In the United States, Prentif was the only brand available for several decades (Prentif was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2005). During this time, it was common to use the term &quot;cervical cap&quot; to refer exclusively to the Prentif brand.

The Lea&#x27;s Shield was a cervical barrier device which was discontinued as of 2008. Some sources use &quot;cervical cap&quot; to refer to the FemCap and Lea&#x27;s Shield. Other sources include FemCap in the term &quot;cervical cap&quot;, but classified the Lea&#x27;s Shield as a distinct device.

In the 1920s, cervical caps (and also diaphragms) were often just called &quot;pessaries&quot;.

Cervical caps or conception caps have also been designed as a form of assisted reproductive technology, used to help people experiencing infertility.

==Medical use==
The effectiveness of cervical caps, as with most other forms of contraception, can be assessed two ways: &quot;method effectiveness&quot; and &quot;actual effectiveness&quot;. The method effectiveness is the proportion of couples correctly and consistently using the method who do not become pregnant. Actual effectiveness is the proportion of couples who intended that method as their sole form of birth control and do not become pregnant; it includes couples who sometimes use the method incorrectly, or sometimes not at all. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use. Most commonly the Pearl Index is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use decrement tables.

&quot;Contraceptive Technology&quot; reports that the method failure rate of the Prentif cervical cap with spermicide is 9% per year for nulliparous women (women who have never given birth), and 26% per year for parous women (who have given birth). The actual pregnancy rates among Prentif users vary depending on the population being studied, with yearly rates of 11% to 32% being reported. An FDA-mandated study reported failure rates: Method rate 6.4% (vs. 4.6% for the diaphragm); Overall rate 17.4% (vs. 16.7% for the diaphragm).

Little data is available on the effectiveness of the Oves cap and FemCap. The Oves manufacturer cites one small study of 17 users. The FemCap website does not cite any data on the current version of the FemCap, but lists data for an older version which is no longer approved by the FDA.

The effectiveness trial of Lea&#x27;s Shield was too small to determine method effectiveness. The actual pregnancy rate was 15% per year. Of the women in the trial, 85% were parous (had given birth). The study authors estimate that for nulliparous women (those who have never given birth) the pregnancy rate in typical use may be lower, around 5% per year.

===Compared to other barrier methods===
In the 1920s, Marie Stopes considered the cervical cap to be the best method of contraception available. Among barrier methods it provides the least intervention of a barrier surface between the penis and vagina resulting in natural contact between them. Except for the Fem-Cap, it also leaves exposed all the vaginal wall so that the hormones, etc. in the seminal fluid of the man can be better absorbed by the woman. The condom does not allow any absorption and the diaphragm exposes less area. However the condom does significantly reduce the likelihood of transmission of STDs. The diaphragm is inserted painlessly. It does not stretch the vagina, nor does it interfere with internal muscle movements during sex, as it is too high up in the vagina. The tip of the penis might touch the cap depending on the position and the size of the penis. Note that what Stopes calls the &quot;Dutch cap&quot; is today known as the &quot;diaphragm&quot;. A partial objection to this claim is that most women do not know how to voluntarily control these muscles, and that some size diaphragms do not stretch the vagina that much, especially if they are smaller in size The cervical cap can be worn for a significantly longer period of time than the diaphragm. It can be inserted several hours before intercourse and used successfully even if a woman&#x27;s partner is drunk, etc. Stopes concludes in favor of the cervical cap and &quot;condemns&quot; the diaphragm &quot;for general use&quot; 

==Side effects==
===Insertion and removal===
There are more complaints about difficulties in removal than difficulties with insertion. Since suction holds the cap on, it may sometimes be difficult to remove unless one knows the tricks of removal. Marie Stopes wrote that for rim caps, one should work the tip of one&#x27;s finger under the rim and pull with a jerk. The idea is to release suction before pulling hard. If one&#x27;s fingers are too short (and/or the vagina too long), one can use an inserter (intended for diaphragms) or have one&#x27;s partner do it.

===Odor===
Since the cervical cap can be worn for longer periods of time than the diaphragm, it is more prone to develop odors which might begin to appear after three continuous days of wear.

==Types==
Several brands of caps were manufactured during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. They can be divided into two types: cavity rim caps, and other caps. Cavity rim caps adhere to the cervix, while other caps adhere to the vaginal walls around the cervix. However, the FemCap (the only cervical cap sold in the United States after 2008) adheres to both.

The cavity rim caps are Prentif, made of latex, and the disposable cap Oves, made of silicone. There are four sizes of Prentif: 22, 25, 28, and 31 mm. There are three sizes of Oves: 26, 28, and 30 mm. Unique among cervical caps, it adheres to the cervix by surface tension, rather than by suction.

The other devices are the latex Dumas and Vimule, and the silicone FemCap, Lea&#x27;s Shield, and Shanghai Lily. There are five sizes of Dumas: 50, 55, 60, 65, and 75 mm. There are three sizes of Vimule: 42, 48, and 52 mm. There are three sizes of FemCap: 22, 26, and 30 mm. There are four sizes of Shanghai Lily: 54, 58, 62, and 66 mm. Lea&#x27;s Shield is manufactured in a single size. Unlike the other caps, Lea&#x27;s Shield has a one-way air valve that helps it seal to the vaginal walls. The valve also allows the passage of cervical mucus. FemCap does not have such a valve and as such can be used to collect cervical mucus to support the Billings method. Both Lea&#x27;s Shield and FemCap have loops to assist in removal.

Shanghai Lily is only available in China. As of 2008, many of the other devices are no longer being manufactured: Prentif, Vimule, and Dumas have been discontinued. Oves is only being sold as a conception cap, not as a birth control device. As of February 2009, FemCap was the only brand of cervical cap available in the United States. FemCap is also available in the UK via the NHS on prescription and is often distributed free from Family Planning Clinics depending on the health authority.
Lea&#x27;s Shield is only available as the German brand LEA contraceptivum.

===FemCap===
As of 2009, FemCap is the only brand available in the United States. A new FemCap performed poorly in a user acceptability study, suggesting that the modifications increased coital pain or discomfort among female users and their male sex partners, and that the modifications did not improve ease of use overall. However, FemCap users are still less likely to report such pain or discomfort than diaphragm users.

===Sponge covered cap===
A cap of the 1920s had a sponge permanently attached to the outer surface of the cap to hold a liquid spermaticide such as vinegar. It was not as easy to clean the cap when removed, due to the sponge part.

===2-part cap===
This cap of the 1920s (the &quot;Mizpah&quot;) had a separate ring (rim) which went around the base of the cervix and was worn constantly. The cap portion (which has its own ring/rim) is snapped into the base ring for use. A criticism of it was that due to the groove in the base ring (so it could attach itself to the cap part) it could not be kept perfectly clean without removing it.

==Design==
===Height of dome===
The dome of a cervical cap may be low with little air space between the dome and the cervix, or high with plenty of air space above the cervix enclosed under the dome. Stopes recommends the high dome type for the following reasons: 1. The high dome cap has room to store secretions from the uterus such as menstrual flow or flow possibly resulting from an orgasm. 2. The high dome cap is allegedly less likely to become dislodged should the penis push hard against the cervix.

===Rim===
Per Stopes (in the 1920s) they should be made of very pliable soft rubber which should not be wrinkled or withered.

Caps of the 1920s had three types of rims: solid rubber (like an o-ring), air-inflated rubber, or a spring encased in rubber. Stopes recommended the all-rubber cap with the solid rubber rim There is also the question as to what is the best shape of the rim cross-section so that the penis is less likely to dislodge the cap by contact with the rim. Some caps such as the Prorace, advocated by Stopes, had a wide but flat thin rim so that a penis contact would tend to push the rim against the fornix which it is already resting against.

===Stopes recommendations===
The type of rim cap recommended by Stopes in the 1920s with a high dome of thin rubber was experimentally revived by Lamberts in England in 1981 and called the &quot;test cap&quot;. It came in six sizes and its light weight meant that it was not as apt to be felt during sexual activity. It was not received well. Some thought it was too flimsy and more likely to dislodge, but Stopes had (in the 1920s) claimed just the opposite for this design, as did the director of a woman&#x27;s health center who tried it out.

==Process==
===Fitting===

Individuals who wish to use a cervical cap are screened by a health care provider to determine if a cervical cap, or one brand of cap, is appropriate for them. If a cap is determined to be appropriate, the provider will determine the proper size. The user must be refitted after any duration of pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is aborted, miscarried, or carried to term through vaginal childbirth or caesarean section.

Several factors may make a cap inappropriate for a particular woman. Women who have given birth may have scar tissue or irregularly shaped cervixes that interfere with the cap forming a good seal. For some women, available sizes of cervical caps do not provide a correct fit. Also, cavity rim caps are not recommended for women with an anteflexed uterus. In infrequent cases a woman may have a long vagina but short fingers and thus may not be able to place the cap correctly. Overall, 80% to 85% of women who want caps can be fitted without issues.

The rim cap should be such that the rim tucks into the fornix snugly and evenly so as to maintain good suction to hold it in place.

In some countries, some devices (such as the Lea&#x27;s Shield) are available without a prescription.

===Method of use===
The first step in inserting or removing a cervical cap is hand washing, to avoid introducing harmful bacteria into the vaginal canal. The cap is inserted prior to sexual intercourse; some sources state that insertion prior to sexual arousal decreases the risk of incorrect placement. Most sources recommend the use of spermicide with the cap, but some sources say spermicide use is optional.

The cap remains in the vagina for a minimum of 6 to 8 hours after the last intravaginal ejaculation. It is recommended the cap be removed within 72 hours (within 48 hours is recommended in the U.S.). Other than the disposable Oves cap, cervical caps can be washed and stored for reuse. Silicone devices may be boiled to sterilize them. Reusable caps may last for one or two years.

Some caps have a pull tab for removal, but it is claimed that pulling on it should not be done, since it the cap tends to adhere very tightly to the cervix. Instead, putting a finger under the rim and pulling with a jerk should easily detach it.

==Acceptability==
It was reported in the 1980s (during the cervical cap renaissance in the U.S.) that &quot;women overwhelmingly preferred the cap to the diaphragm&quot;. On average, women also reported an increase in libido and frequency of sex.

The Oves cap and the new version of the FemCap performed poorly in user acceptability studies. The study on the FemCap concluded that the modifications to the FemCap significantly increased pain and discomfort among female users and their male sex partners, and that the modifications decreased acceptability of the device compared with the earlier version. The study of the Oves cap reported that few women indicated that they would use the cap in the future.

A pilot study conducted in Britain prior to the Lea&#x27;s Shield&#x27;s approval concluded that the Lea&#x27;s Shield &quot;may be acceptable to a highly select minority of women&quot;.

As of 2002, the cervical cap was one of the least common methods of contraception in the United States. A 2002 study indicated that of sexually active American women, 0.6% are currently using either the cervical cap, contraceptive sponge, or female condom as their primary method of contraception, and fewer than 1% have ever used a cervical cap.

==History==

===Ancient===
The idea of blocking the cervix to prevent pregnancy is thousands of years old. Various cultures have used cervix-shaped devices such as oiled paper cones or lemon halves. Others made sticky mixtures that included honey or cedar rosin, to be applied to the os. The modern idea of a cervical cap as a fitted device that seals itself against the vaginal walls is of more recent origin; it emerged within the past century.

===19th century===
In 1838, German gynecologist Friedrich Wilde created the first modern cervical cap by making custom-made rubber molds of the cervix for some of his patients. These caps were probably short-lived, as uncured rubber degrades fairly quickly. An important precursor to the invention of more lasting caps was the rubber vulcanization process, patented by Charles Goodyear in 1844. In the 1840s or 1860s E.B. Foote, a U.S. physician claims to have invented the cervical cap but it&#x27;s reported that his patent was denied since the device could be used for obscene purposes. Foote claimed that his invention was &quot;widely counterfeited&quot;. An occlusive pessary marketed in the United States as the &quot;womb veil&quot; seems to have been an early form of diaphragm or cervical cap.

Over the next several decades, the cervical cap became the most widely used barrier contraceptive method in Western Europe and Britain. Although the diaphragm was always more popular in the United States than the cervical cap, the cap was also common.

===20th century===
Many designs were developed in the later 19th and early 20th century in various countries. The Vimule cap became available as early as 1927. A book by Vimule and Co., published in 1898, advertises the Vimule Cap. The Prentif brand cap was introduced in the early 1930s. The Dumas cap was initially made of plastic, and was available by the 1940s. Lamberts (Dalston) Ltd. of the UK manufactured these three cap types. Other types of caps had stems to hold them in place in the cervix; some of the stems actually extended into the uterus. These stem pessaries became precursors to the modern intrauterine device (IUD).

Margaret Sanger brought cervical caps to the U.S. in the 1910s, but later on seemingly preferred the diaphragm, and never repudiated the cap. This may have been influenced by her visit to the Netherlands where the diaphragm (also known as the &quot;Dutch Cap&quot;) reigned supreme.

Use of all barrier methods, but especially cervical barriers, dropped dramatically after the 1960s introduction of the combined oral contraceptive pill and the IUD. In 1976, the U.S. government enacted the Medical Device Regulation Act. This law required all manufacturers of medical devices to provide the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with data on the safety and efficacy of those devices. Lamberts (Dalston) Ltd., the only manufacturer at that time, failed to provide this information, and the FDA banned the use of cervical caps in the United States.

In the late 1970s, the FDA reclassified the cervical cap as an investigational device, and it regained limited availability. Within a few years, the FDA withdrew investigational status from the Vimule cap, following a study that associated its use with vaginal lacerations. In 1988, the then 60-year-old Prentif cap gained FDA approval. The feminist movement played a large role in re-introducing the cervical cap to the United States. One paper called its involvement at all steps of the FDA approval process &quot;unprecedented&quot;. This renewed interest in the cervical cap has been called &quot;The cervical cap renaissance&quot;.

===Quality===
In the 1920s it was reported from England that &quot;careless and hasty construction&quot; could sometimes be found in many brands. Some caps had a seam in the dome (two parts of it were welded together making a seam) and the seam might be defective and even contain minute perforations. Also, the junction between the rim and the dome might be rough and difficult to clean. Caps that were seamless avoided the &quot;seam&quot; problem. It was suggested that caps should be inspected for possible defects by the user under a magnifying glass.

==In popular culture==
A cervical cap is very likely the contraceptive that maid Anna Bates buys for her mistress Lady Mary Crawley in the second episode of the fifth series of the period drama Downton Abbey. Mary Crawley is inspired by the book &quot;Married Love&quot;, from Marie Stopes.

<text>Publication of comic strips and comic books focusing on science fiction became increasingly common during the early 1930s in newspapers published in the United States. They have since spread to many countries around the world.

==History==
The first science fiction comic was the gag cartoon &quot;Mr. Skygack, from Mars&quot; by A.D. Condo, which debuted in newspapers in 1907. The first non-humorous science fiction comic strip, &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, appeared in 1929, 
 and was based on a story published that year in Amazing Stories. It was quickly followed by others in the genre, such as &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Brick Bradford&quot;, and the British strip &quot;Dan Dare&quot;. This influence spread to comic books, in which science fiction themes became increasingly more popular; one title was &quot;Planet Comics&quot;. With the introduction of &quot;Superman&quot;, the superhero genre was born, which often included science fiction elements. EC Comics had success and popularity in publishing science fiction comics of increasing complexity. However, a wave of anti-comic feeling stirred-up among parents and educators by Dr. Fredric Wertham&#x27;s book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; threatened to drive them out of business. In spite of opposition, science fiction in comics continued in the U.S. through the 1960s with stories for children and teenagers, and began to return to the adult market again in the late 1960s with the wave of hippy underground comics.

=== Japan ===
Japanese manga also featured science fiction elements. In the 1950s, Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot; was one of the first major manga that centered around science fiction. In the following decades, many other creators and works would follow, including Leiji Matsumoto (e.g. &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;), Katsuhiro Otomo (e.g. &quot;Akira&quot;) and Masamune Shirow (e.g. &quot;Appleseed&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot;).

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, the publication of &quot;Eagle&quot; gave a platform for the launch of Dan Dare in 1950. Dan Dare and other comics in Briton at this time were aimed at children and they were printed on newsprint. Magazines on the other hand were aimed at adults and were printed on better glossier paper these magazines were mostly in black and white. Starting in the mid-sixties, &quot;The Trigan Empire&quot;, drawn by Don Lawrence (who would later go on to create &quot;Storm&quot;) was featured in &quot;Look and Learn.&quot; In the 1970s, publications, such as &quot;2000 AD&quot;, featured a selection of regular stories putting a science fiction spin on popular themes, like sports or war. Its success spawned a number of spin-offs in imitators like &quot;Tornado&quot;, &quot;Starlord&quot;, and &quot;Crisis&quot;, none of which lasted more than a few years, with the earlier titles being merged back into &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

=== France ===
The first French comic with a science fiction theme was &quot;Zig et Puce au XXIème Siècle&quot; (Zig &amp; Puce In The 21st Century), originally serialized in a French Sunday newspaper before being published as an album in 1935; this was one of the many adventures of the teenage characters Zig and Puce first created in 1925. The first French science fiction comics story that was not geared toward the adolescent audience was &quot;Futuropolis&quot;, serialized in the comics magazine &quot;Junior&quot; in 1937-1938; the pseudo-sequel &quot;Electropolis&quot; followed in 1940. When the Nazi occupation forces banned the import of &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; into France, &quot;Le Rayon U&quot; (The U Ray) was created as replacement in the magazine &quot;Bravo&quot; which had been running the former. Other French science fiction comics which debuted in 1943 include &quot;Otomox&quot;, featuring a powerful robot, serialized in &quot;Pic et Nic&quot;, and &quot;L&#x27;Épervier Bleu&quot; (The Blue Hawk), serialized in &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine. The first French comics magazine exclusively featuring a science fiction hero was in 1947 with the relatively short-lived &quot;Radar&quot;. A far longer lasting French comics magazine would be the small-format &quot;Meteor&quot;, published from 1953 through 1964; its main feature was &quot;Les Connquerants de l&#x27;espace&quot; (The Conquerors of Space). Subsequent notable French science fiction include publications like &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; and authors like Enki Bilal (e.g. The Nikopol Trilogy) and Moebius.

=== Webcomics ===
With the invention of the Internet, a number of science fiction comics have been published primarily online. Among the earliest science fiction webcomics was &quot;Polymer City Chronicles&quot;, which first appeared in 1994. Other notable comics include &quot;Schlock Mercenary&quot;, and &quot;Starslip Crisis&quot;. 

==Graphic novels==
A science fiction graphic novel is a full-length book that uses images necessarily to depict a story of a fictional nature that explores different/future time lines, theoretical societies, technology and/or both. 

The first recorded usage of the term, according to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), is in 1978 by Will Eisner: &quot;A contract with God: and other tenement stories... A graphic novel&quot;, though graphic novels existed for years prior. While predating the term, a graphic novel based on science fiction, &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, by Osamu Tezuka, was published in 1951, starring a childlike robot Astro Boy who was activated in the year 2003.

<text>A tender or coal-car (US only) is a special rail vehicle hauled by a steam locomotive containing its fuel (wood, coal, oil or torrefied biomass) and water. Steam locomotives consume large quantities of water compared to the quantity of fuel, so their tenders are necessary to keep them running over long distances. A locomotive that pulls a tender is called a tender locomotive. Locomotives that do not have tenders and carry all their fuel and water on board are called &quot;tank locomotives&quot; or &quot;tank engines&quot;.

A [[Gangway_connection#Locomotives_(corridor_tenders)|corridor tender]] is a locomotive tender with a passageway to one side, allowing crew changes on the fly.

A brake tender is a tender that is heavy and used (primarily) to provide greater braking efficiency.

==General functions==
The largest steam locomotives are semi-permanently coupled by a drawbar to a tender that carries the water and fuel. The fuel source used depends on what is economically available locally. In the UK and parts of Europe, a plentiful supply of coal made this the obvious choice from the earliest days of the steam engine. Until around 1850 in the United States, the vast majority of locomotives burned wood until most of the eastern forests were cleared. Subsequently, coal burning became more widespread, and wood burners were restricted to rural and logging districts.

===Water supply===

By the mid-1800s, most steam locomotive tenders consisted of a fuel bunker (that held coal or wood) surrounded by a U-shaped (when viewed from the top) water jacket. The overall shape of the tender was usually rectangular. The bunker which held the coal was sloped downwards toward the locomotive providing easier access to the coal. The ratio of water to fuel capacities of tenders was normally based on two water-stops to each fuel stop because water was more readily available than fuel. One pound [] of coal could turn six pounds of water (0.7 gallons) [] to steam. Therefore, tender capacity ratios were normally close to 7 tons (14,000 lb) [] of coal per 10,000 gallons [] of water.
The water supply in a tender was replenished at water stops and locomotive depots from a dedicated water tower connected to water cranes or gantries. Refilling the tender is the job of the fireman, who is responsible for maintaining the locomotive&#x27;s fire, steam pressure, and supply of fuel and water.

Water carried in the tender must be forced into the boiler, to replace that which is consumed during operation. Early engines used pumps driven by the motion of the pistons. Later, steam injectors replaced the pump while some engines used turbopumps.

====With track pans or water troughs====
In the UK, the US and France, water troughs (in the US, track pans) were provided on some main lines to allow locomotives to replenish their water supply while moving. A &quot;water scoop&quot; was fitted under the tender or the rear water tank in the case of a large tank engine; the fireman remotely lowered the scoop into the trough, the speed of the engine forced the water up into the tank, and the scoop was raised once it was full.

The fuel and water capacities of a tender are usually proportional to the rate at which they are consumed, though there were exceptions. The Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad used track pans on many of their routes, allowing locomotives to pick up water at speed. The result was that the water tanks on these tenders were proportionally much smaller.

In the UK water troughs were used by three of the Big Four railways. The exception was the Southern Railway – mainly because the majority of the Southern&#x27;s operations were based around short-distance commuter, suburban and rural services with frequent station stops where water could be taken on from water columns. The Southern&#x27;s decision to electrify its routes into London with a third rail system also made the installation of water troughs impractical. Only on the former London and South Western Railway routes west of Salisbury, where long-distance express trains operated, was the lack of troughs a problem. Rather than install troughs the L&amp;SWR (and the Southern) equipped its express locomotives with special high-capacity tenders with a water capacity of 4,000 gallons (18,200 L) running on a pair of twin-axle bogies. These were known to railwaymen as &quot;water cart&quot; tenders.

===Condensing tenders===

Condensing steam locomotives were designed to recycle exhaust steam by condensing it into feed water. The principal benefit is conservation of water, but the thermal efficiency of the engine is also increased, since much of the heat otherwise lost in the exhaust is used to preheat water injected into the boiler. In some cases condensing was employed simply to improve visibility by eliminating clouds of exhaust.

A primitive approach to condensation simply injected the spent steam into the tender tank, relying on the mass of water for cooling. More sophisticated tenders, such as those used in the South African Railways Class 25 locomotives designed for service in the Karoo, replaced most of the water tank with a huge radiator, in which the steam was cooled and condensed. Exhaust steam, after passing through an oil-water separator, was conveyed to the tender, where it powered a low-pressure turbine used to drive the radiator fans. The steam then passed into the radiator. The condensate was injected into the boiler with another turbine-driven pump. This was a quite complex bit of machinery, also requiring another turbine in the smokebox to provide the exhaust draft normally obtained by blowing the exhaust steam up the stack. Eventually the SAR examples were converted to conventional locomotives by replacing the radiator with a long water tank.

===Fuel supply===
A factor that limits locomotive performance is the rate at which fuel is fed into the fire. Much of the fireman&#x27;s time is spent throwing wood or shoveling coal into the firebox of the locomotive to maintain constant steam pressure. In the early 20th century some locomotives became so large that the fireman could not shovel coal fast enough. Consequently, in the United States, various steam-powered mechanical stokers (typically using an auger feed between the fuel bunker and the firebox) became standard equipment and were adopted elsewhere, including Australia and South Africa.

==Tender design variants==

In the early days of railroading, tenders were rectangular boxes, with a bunker for coal or wood surrounded by a U-shaped water jacket. This form was retained up to the end of steam on many coal-burning engines. Oil-burning engines substituted a fuel tank for the bunker. Variations on this plan were made for operational reasons, in attempts to economize on structure.

=== Vanderbilt ===

In early 1901, Cornelius Vanderbilt III filed a patent application covering a new type of tender.
Vanderbilt was the great-grandson of the founder of the New York Central Railroad; his tender featured a cylindrical body like a tank car with a fuel bunker set into the front end. This design was soon adopted by a number of American railroads with oil-burning and coal-burning locomotives.

Compared to rectangular tenders, cylindrical Vanderbilt tenders were stronger, lighter, and held more fuel in relation to surface area. Railroads who were noted for using Vanderbilt tenders include:
*Baltimore &amp; Ohio
*Canadian National
*Grand Trunk Western
*Great Northern Railway
*Southern Pacific
*Union Pacific
*Hungarian State Railways (MÁV Class 203)
*New Zealand Railways Department (NZR AB class, NZR J class, NZR G class (1928)).
*Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway
*Seaboard Air Line Railroad
*South African Railways

===Whaleback===

A form peculiar to oil-burning engines was the &quot;whaleback&quot; tender (also sometimes called a &quot;turtle-back&quot; or &quot;loaf&quot; tender). This was a roughly half-cylindrical form with the rounded side up; the forward portion of the tank held the oil, while the remainder held the water. This form was particularly associated with the Southern Pacific.

===Slopeback===

In the United States, tenders with sloped backs were often used for locomotives in yard switching service, because they greatly improved the engineer&#x27;s ability to see behind the locomotive when switching cars. The reduced water capacity was not a problem, as the tender&#x27;s water tank could be frequently refilled in the rail yard. In the 1880s, numerous locomotive manufacturers were offering tenders with this design on small switcher locomotives.

===Corridor===
For the introduction of the London and North Eastern Railway&#x27;s non-stop &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; service on 1 May 1928, ten special tenders were built with means to reach the locomotive from the train through a narrow passageway inside the tender tank plus a flexible bellows connection linking it with the leading coach. The passageway, which ran along the right-hand side of the tender, was high and wide. Further corridor tenders were built at intervals until 1938, and eventually there were 22; at various times, they were coupled to engines of classes A1, A3, A4 and W1, but by the end of 1948, all were running with class A4 locomotives. Use of the corridor tender for changing crews on the move in an A4 loco is shown in the 1953 British Transport film &quot;Elizabethan Express&quot;, the name of another London-Edinburgh non-stop train.
===Water cart===

The &quot;water cart&quot; was a type of high-capacity tender used by the London and South Western Railway in England. Unlike the usual British six-wheel tender, it was a double-bogie design with inside bearings. This gave it a distinctive appearance because the wheels were very obvious.

===Canteen===

An additional tender which holds only water is called a &quot;canteen&quot; or &quot;auxiliary tender&quot;. During the steam era, these were not frequently used. Water tanks were placed at regular intervals along the track, making a canteen unnecessary in most cases. However, there were times that canteens proved economical. The Norfolk and Western Railway used canteens with its giant 2-8-8-2 Y Class and 2-6-6-4 A Class locomotives on coal trains, timed freights, fast freights, and merchandise freights. Use of the canteen allowed one of the water stops to be skipped, allowing the train to avoid climbing a hill from a dead stop. Currently, the Union Pacific Railroad uses two canteens with its steam locomotives 844 and 4014 on excursion trains. Virtually all the trackside tanks were removed when steam locomotives were retired. Nowadays, fire hydrant hookups are used, which fills the tanks much more slowly. The canteens allow for greater range between stops.

Canteens were also used on the Trans-Australian Railway which crosses the waterless Nullarbor Plain. In New South Wales these vehicles were called &quot;gins&quot;, and were used in the predominantly dry western region and on some branch lines. Now prominently use on heritage excursions due to the lack of places with accessible water points. During the catastrophic 2019-2020 bushfire season, as fires devastated towns near the Rail Transport Museum at Thirlmere, south of Sydney, a diesel locomotive from the museum hauled two gins to help replenish firefighting tanker trucks.

In the United Kingdom, a canteen was used on the preserved &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; during enthusiast excursions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The water troughs that had previously supplied long-distance expresses had been removed during dieselisation of the railway network. On 25 July 2009, &quot;Bittern&quot; made a 188-mile run from King&#x27;s Cross to York non-stop using a second tender. As railways in Britain tend to be much shorter than those in the US, the canteen was not an economical proposition.

===Fuel tender===
Sometimes a tender will be used for a diesel locomotive. This is typically a tank car with a fuel line that connects to the locomotive and MU connections to allow locomotives behind the tender to be controlled remotely. The Burlington Northern Railroad used fuel tenders in remote territory where fuel was expensive. Diesel fuel could be bought cheaply and loaded into the tender. A common consist was two EMD SD40-2s with a tender between them. Some of the tenders survived the Burlington Northern Santa Fe merger but retain the black and green BN colors. The Southern Pacific Railroad also briefly experimented with fuel tenders for diesels. Some slugs have fuel tanks and serve as fuel tenders for the attached locomotives, especially those that are converted from locomotives that are retired due to worn-out diesels.

The Union Pacific Railroad used fuel tenders on its turbines. These tenders were originally used with steam locomotives, then reworked to hold heavy &quot;Bunker C&quot; fuel oil. Fuel capacity was about 23,000 gallons (87,000 liters). When the turbines were retired, some of the tenders were reworked to hold water, and employed as canteens for steam locomotives.

Fuel tenders have also been the cause of controversy for railroads, in particular the Soo Line. In the late 1970s, the management of the railroad discovered that it was cheaper for them to fill their fuel tenders at Chicago, and then transport the fuel to Shoreham Wisconsin. Doing this avoided the railroad needing to pay extra taxes on the fuel, and the system was continued until the mid 1980s. When the states of Illinois and Wisconsin caught onto the railroad&#x27;s actions, legislation was passed which charged the same over the road tax on the fuel movement over rail which was charged for truck drivers. Doing this completely negated the benefit of moving the fuel by way of the tenders, and Soo quietly withdrew the practice.

Tenders have also been developed to carry liquefied natural gas for diesel locomotives converted to run on that fuel.

===Brake tender===
On British railways, brake tenders were low, heavy wagons used with early main line diesel locomotives. One or two were coupled in front or behind the locomotive to provide extra braking power when hauling unfitted or partially fitted freight trains (trains formed from wagons not fitted with automatic brakes). They were required as the lighter weight of the new diesel locomotives, compared to steam, meant that they had comparable tractive effort (and thus train hauling capacity) but less braking ability. Originally intended to be used in North East England, where they were usually propelled (pushed) by the locomotive, and later used in other regions. On the Southern Region they were normally hauled behind the locomotive.

The tender took the form of a hollow box, low enough to avoid obscuring the driver&#x27;s view when pushed. The body was carried on a pair of former carriage bogies, which provided the automatic brakes. The body was filled with scrap steel to raise the weight of the vehicle to – tons; consequently increasing the available brake force. Four lamp brackets were provided at each end to display locomotive headcode discs describing the class of train – when propelled, the tender obscured the front of the locomotive, and hence the headcode.

Introduced around 1964–65, they were taken out of use in the 1980s when the practice of using unfitted trains was discontinued. None survived in preservation but an operational replica has been constructed on the Great Central Railway from the remnants of a Mk1 corridor coach and has been given the next number in the brake tender sequence; B964122.

===Powered tender===
Certain early British steam locomotives were fitted with powered tenders. As well as holding coal and water, these had wheels powered from the locomotive to provide greater tractive effort. These were abandoned for economic reasons; railwaymen working on locomotives so equipped demanded extra pay as they were effectively running two locomotives. However, the concept was tried again on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway&#x27;s &quot;River Mite&quot;, and the Garratt locomotive may be seen as an extension of this principle. Powered tenders were also seen on the triplex locomotives in the United States, but these experiments were not considered successful due to the varying mass of the tender. Powered tenders were used extensively on geared logging steam locomotives like the Shay, Climax, and Heisler types where the steep grades and heavy trains necessitated the extra tractive effort.

Nowadays, slugs are used with diesel-electric locomotives. The slug has traction motors that draw electricity from the locomotive&#x27;s prime mover to provide extra traction.

===German practice===
In Germany, attention was given to ensuring that tender locomotives were capable of moderately high speeds in reverse, pushing their tenders. The numerous DRB Class 50 (2-10-0) locomotives, for example, were capable of in either direction, and were commonly used on branch lines without turning facilities.

A source of possible confusion with regards to German locomotives is that in German, &#x27; means a tank locomotive. A locomotive with a separate, hauled tender is a &#x27;.

==Tender-first operations==
In some instances, particularly on branch lines having no turnaround such as a turntable or wye at the terminus point, locomotives ran in reverse with the tender leading the train. In such instances, a headlamp (US) or headcode lamps/discs were placed on the leading end of the tender. Locomotive crews often rigged a tarpaulin (or the locomotive&#x27;s storm sheet, if available) from the rear of the cab roof to the front of the tender to provide protection from the wind and to prevent coal dust being blown into the cab. Tenders designed for more frequent tender-first workings were often fitted with a fixed cab panel and windows, providing an almost fully enclosed cab.

<text>Stalybridge Celtic Football Club is an English football club based in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester. They are currently members of the and play at Bower Fold. The team traditionally plays in a blue and white strip.

In 1921, Stalybridge Celtic became a founder member of the Football League&#x27;s Third Division North. After only two seasons in the new league, they became the first club to leave the new division.

==History==
The club&#x27;s formation is usually given as 1909. However, it may have been as early as 1905 when an amateur club with the same name was formed. There were players called Storrs and Manwood who played in the 1906 and 1909 teams, and a player called Rhodes who played in the amateurs&#x27; first game; a Herbert Rhodes was a significant benefactor of the &#x27;later&#x27; Celtic.

The club played for two seasons in the Lancashire and Cheshire Amateur League, before turning professional and joining the Lancashire Combination becoming second division champions at the first attempt. They followed it up with a fourth place and runners up spot in the Central League. In an attempt to progress the club joined the Southern League. The club rejoined the Central League for the 1919–20 season and in 1921 became one of the founder members of the Football League&#x27;s Third Division North. However the club resigned after two seasons, as it was felt that it could not attract enough support to justify a League side – in spite of the fact that average attendance of 5,480 in 1922 was almost 2,000 more than neighbouring Rochdale, who played in the same Division. The full Celtic story in the League is detailed in &quot;Manchester A Football History&quot; where Celtic are given the same level of analysis and research as the Manchester region&#x27;s other sides.

They joined the Cheshire County League remaining members for 60 years and winning the title only once in 1980. With the league&#x27;s merger with the Lancashire Combination in 1982, they became founder members of the North West Counties League, winning the title in 1984 and 1987, with the latter triumph resulting in them being promoted to the Northern Premier League (NPL). In 1992 the club won the league title and was promoted to the Football Conference, playing at that level for six seasons to 1998 before being relegated to the NPL again, after finishing bottom.

In 2000–01, the club had one of the best seasons in its history, achieving a treble of the Cheshire Senior Cup, the President&#x27;s Cup and the Northern Premier League Premier Division, thus being promoted back to the Football Conference (though they were relegated after only one season). When the conference added a second level for the 2004–05 season, the club became one of the founders of the new Conference North. Until the end of 2006–07 season the manager was John Reed, who had extensive experience as a manager in English non-league football, including three successful seasons as manager of Harrogate Town. On 30 May 2007 Steve Burr was appointed as a manager.
The 2007–08 season was one of the best in recent times; after finishing 18th the previous year, a third-place finish in the league meant a promotion opportunity to the Conference National was presented via the play-offs. After reaching the final, Stalybridge were denied after a 1–0 defeat to Barrow.

The club continued in the Conference North for the three seasons; placing 6th in the 2008–09 season in which manager Steve Burr left for Kidderminster, 10th in the 2009–10 season and 10th again in the 2010–11 season.

In the 2011–12 season, they were a huge contender for a promotion place as late as February before a poor set of results saw their hopes slip away towards the end of the season, finishing sixth, just below the last playoff place.

In the 2012–13 season, after languishing near the relegation zone for most of the year, they finished 11th following a 9-game unbeaten run. Stalybridge also reached the final of the Cheshire Senior Cup, losing 2–1 to Chester F.C.

The 2013–14 season wasn&#x27;t a good one either, as Stalybridge finished 19th, narrowly avoiding relegation by 2 points. Jim Harvey was sacked in October 2013, being replaced by former player Keith Briggs. They secured Conference North football for another season with a 1–1 draw against Bradford Park Avenue in the penultimate game of the season.

The 2014–15 season was arguably the worst for a long time. Stalybridge struggled to keep their heads above water, which led to the resignation of Keith Briggs in March 2015. He was replaced by 3-time Conference North winning manager, Liam Watson. This brought a turn around in results, with Watson only losing 1 of his 7 games in charge, winning 4. Survival came down to the final game against Gainsborough, with Stalybridge needing to better Colwyn Bay&#x27;s and Brackley&#x27;s results. A pulsating match finished 4–4, and they survived on goal difference. The club were relegated from the NPL Premier Division in the 2022–23 season.

==Stadium==
There has been a ground at Bower Fold since 1906. The current main stand was built in 1996, with the covered stand at the Town End (Joe Jackson Stand) dating from 1994. The main stand, replaced a wooden one dating from 1909, which held 500 fans, before being converted to tip-up seating with a reduced capacity of around 400 persons. The Lord Pendry Stand opened in 2004, replacing a covered terrace dating from the 1950s. The Mottram End cover stems from construction starting in the 1970s and finishing in the mid &#x27;80s. The main stand, holding about 700 people, is all seated. Its opposite stand, the Lord Pendry stand has 652 seats.

It is possible for the ground to be segregated with self-contained areas which include separate turnstiles, refreshment facilities and toilets (though this is rarely necessary). The away fans&#x27; area in this case is uncovered. The next area (clockwise from the away fans&#x27; area) around the ground is the Lockwood and Greenwood stand which is a covered standing area. This area is popular with home fans when Stalybridge are kicking towards this goal. Next is an uncovered standing area, followed by the Lord Tom Pendry Stand (a seated area) with a capacity of approximately three hundred. Next is a small uncovered area followed by the covered Joe Jackson stand. The club shop and bar are behind this stand. Away fans are allowed to use the bar and there is no admission charge. Next are the main turnstiles, refreshment facilities and disabled spectators&#x27; area.

The ground&#x27;s capacity of 6,500 has not been reached recently. The attendance was nearly 4,000 when Chester visited for an FA Cup 1st round match in 1999.

<doc id="387837" wikidata="Q191963" url="?curid=387837" title="John Edward Gray">
<text>John Edward Gray (12 February 1800 – 7 March 1875) was a British zoologist. He was the elder brother of zoologist George Robert Gray and son of the pharmacologist and botanist Samuel Frederick Gray (1766–1828). The same is used for a zoological name.

Gray was keeper of zoology at the British Museum in London from 1840 until Christmas 1874, before the natural history holdings were split off to the Natural History Museum. He published several catalogues of the museum collections that included comprehensive discussions of animal groups and descriptions of new species. He improved the zoological collections to make them amongst the best in the world.

==Biography==
Gray was born in Walsall, but his family soon moved to London, where Gray studied medicine. He assisted his father in writing &quot;The Natural Arrangement of British Plants&quot; (1821). After being blackballed by the Linnean Society of London, Gray shifted his interest from botany to zoology. He began his zoological career by volunteering to collect insects for the British Museum at age 15. He officially joined the Zoological Department in 1824 to help John George Children catalog the reptile collection. In some of his early articles, Gray adopted William Sharp Macleay&#x27;s quinarian system for classifications of molluscs (1824), butterflies (1824), echinoderms (1825), reptiles (1825), and mammals (1825). In 1840, he took over Children&#x27;s position as keeper of zoology, which he held for 35 years, publishing well over 1,000 papers. He named many cetacean species, genera, subfamilies, and families.

During this period, he collaborated with Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, the noted natural history artist, in producing &quot;Gleanings from the Menagerie at Knowsley&quot;. The menagerie at Knowsley Hall, near Liverpool, founded by Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby, at the Stanley ancestral seat, was one of the largest private menageries in Victorian England.

Gray married Maria Emma Smith in 1826. She helped him with his scientific work, especially with her drawings.

In 1833, Gray was a founder of what became the Royal Entomological Society.

Gray was a friend of coleopterist Hamlet Clark, and in 1856–57 they sailed on Gray&#x27;s yacht &quot;Miranda&quot; to Spain, Algeria, and Brazil. Gray was an accomplished watercolourist, and his landscape paintings illustrate Clark&#x27;s account of their journeys.

Gray was also interested in postage stamps. On 1 May 1840, the day the Penny Black first went on sale, he purchased several with the intent to save them.

During his 50 years employed at the British Museum, Gray wrote nearly 500 papers, including many descriptions of species new to science. These had been presented to the museum by collectors from around the world, and included all branches of zoology, although Gray usually left the descriptions of new birds to his younger brother and colleague George. Gray was also active in malacology, the study of molluscs. He was an associate of entomologist Eliza Fanny Staveley, supporting her research and reading papers she had prepared to the Linnean and Zoological Societies of London.

John Edward Gray was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lewisham.

==Taxa named by him and in his honour==

Gray was one of the most prolific taxonomists in the history of zoology. He described more than 300 species and subspecies of reptiles, only surpassed by his successors at the British Museum, George A. Boulenger and Albert Günther and American zoologist Edward D. Cope.

Gray described and named numerous marine snails including:
*The genus &quot;Lithopoma&quot; 
*The genus &quot;Euthria&quot; 

Genera named in his honour include:
*The snake genus &quot;Grayia&quot; 
Species and subspecies named in his honour include:

*&quot;Ardeola grayii&quot; – Indian pond heron
*&quot;Mesoplodon grayi&quot; – Gray&#x27;s beaked whale
*&quot;Crocidura grayi&quot; – Luzon shrew
*&quot;Ablepharus grayanus&quot; 
*&quot;Delma grayii&quot; 
*&quot;Microlophus grayii&quot; 
*&quot;Naultinus grayii&quot; 
*&quot;Salvelinus grayi&quot; 
*&quot;Tropidophorus grayi&quot; 
*&quot;Trachemys venusta grayi&quot; 
*Gray&#x27;s pipefish, also known as the Mud Pipefish or Spiny Pipefish &quot;Halicampus grayi&quot; is named after him.

<doc id="387842" wikidata="Q7756040" url="?curid=387842" title="The Parable of the Old Man and the Young">
<text>&quot;The Parable of the Old Man and the Young&quot; is a poem by Wilfred Owen that compares the ascent of Abraham to Mount Moriah and his near-sacrifice of Isaac there with the start of World War I. It had first been published by Siegfried Sassoon in 1920 with the title &quot;The Parable of the Old Man and the Young&quot;, without the last line: &quot;And half the seed of Europe, one by one&quot;. The poem is an allusion to a story in the Bible, Genesis 22:1-18.

==Overview==
In the poem, the biblical patriarch Abraham (significantly called by his former name, Abram, in the poem) takes Isaac—his only begotten son by his wife Sarah—with him to make a sacrificial offering to God. The offering, though Isaac does not know this, is to be Isaac himself. &quot;Then Abram bound the youth with belts and straps&quot;, which suggests imagery relating to a young soldier being sent, possibly against his will, in a uniform to fight. When he makes to sacrifice his son, an angel calls from heaven, and tells Abram not to harm Isaac. Instead, he must offer the &quot;Ram of Pride&quot;. Then the last two lines of the poem diverge from the Biblical account, set apart for greater effect: &quot;But the old man would not so, but slew his son, / and half the seed of Europe, one by one.&quot;

&quot;The Parable of the Old Man and the Young&quot; is written loosely in iambic pentameter. It does not use traditional rhyme; instead, the lines are bound together by assonance, consonance, and alliteration.

As the title mentions, the poem is a parable. It is generally accepted that the old man, Abram, represents the European nations or more probably their governments. Another less common opinion is that he represents Germany or Kaiser Wilhelm II, whom some would claim started the war. However, Owen does not blame any individual nation or person in any of his other poems, so there is no reason to believe that he does so in this one. Rather, he condemns all those in power who took their countries to war.

According to the poem, the rulers of Europe believed that sacrificing their nations&#x27; (Ram of) Pride was too high a price, yet the irony is that the real cost of this Pride was millions of dead—the seed of Europe.

The last two lines are the only ones that rhyme, and the image they paint is chilling: an old man methodically killing the seed of Europe. It is mainly the power of this image, set out in the poem and culminating in the last two lines, that makes it haunting.

The poem is among those set in the &quot;War Requiem&quot; of Benjamin Britten.

<doc id="387847" wikidata="Q744729" url="?curid=387847" title="Cachaça">
<text>Cachaça () is a distilled spirit made from fermented sugarcane juice. Also known as &quot;pinga&quot;, &quot;caninha&quot;, and other names, it is the most popular spirit in Brazil. Outside Brazil, cachaça is used almost exclusively as an ingredient in tropical drinks, with the &quot;caipirinha&quot; being the most famous and popular cocktail. In Brazil, caipirinha is often paired with the dish &quot;feijoada&quot;.

== History ==

Sugar production was mostly switched from the Madeira islands to Brazil by the Portuguese in the 16th century. In Madeira, &quot;aguardente de cana&quot; is made by distilling sugar cane juice into liquor, and the pot stills from Madeira were brought to Brazil to make what today is also called &quot;cachaça&quot;. The process dates from 1532, when one of the Portuguese colonists brought the first cuttings of sugar cane to Brazil from Madeira.

The name &quot;Cachaça&quot; is legally protected; it can only be produced in Brazil, where, according to 2007 figures, are consumed annually, compared with outside the country. It is typically between 38% and 48% alcohol by volume. When homemade, it can be as strong as the distiller wants. Up to six grams of sugar per liter may be added.

Figures from 2003 indicate 1.3 billion liters of cachaça are produced each year; only 1% of this is exported (mainly to Germany).

== Production ==
&quot;Cachaça&quot;, like rum, has two varieties: unaged (, &quot;white&quot; or &quot;prata&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;) and aged (&quot;amarela&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot; or &quot;ouro&quot;, &quot;gold&quot;). White &quot;cachaça&quot; is usually bottled immediately after distillation and tends to be cheaper. Some producers age it for up to 12 months in wooden barrels to achieve a smoother blend. It is often used as an ingredient in caipirinha and other mixed beverages. Dark &quot;cachaça&quot;, usually seen as the &quot;premium&quot; variety, is aged in wood barrels and is meant to be drunk neat. It is usually aged for up to 3 years, though some ultra-premium &quot;cachaças&quot; have been aged for up to 15 years. Its flavour is influenced by the type of wood the barrel is made from.

There are very important regions in Brazil where fine pot still &quot;cachaça&quot; is produced, such as Salinas in Minas Gerais state, Chã Grande in Pernambuco state, Paraty in Rio de Janeiro state, Monte Alegre do Sul in São Paulo, Luiz Alves in Santa Catarina state, and Abaíra in Bahia state. Nowadays, producers of &quot;cachaça&quot; can be found in most Brazilian regions, and in 2011, there were over 40,000 of them.

=== Heavy metals ===
&quot;Cachaça&quot; is produced in copper stills. Levels of copper in homemade &quot;cachaças&quot; can exceed the legal limits established by Brazilian law. Some copper is considered desirable in the distillation process as a catalyst for the oxidation of sulfur compounds produced by fermentation, but the levels must be controlled by adequate maintenance and cleaning of the still to remove accumulated verdigris. Adsorbents are used, but the most commonly used adsorbents, activated carbon and ion-exchange resin, have been shown to alter the chemical composition of &quot;cachaça&quot;. Sugarcane bagasse has been proposed as a selective adsorbent.

== Synonyms ==
For more than four centuries of history, &quot;cachaça&quot; has accumulated synonyms and creative nicknames coined by the Brazilian people. Some of these words were created for the purpose of deceiving the supervision of the metropolis in the days when &quot;cachaça&quot; was banned in Brazil; the beverage was competing with the European distillate grappa. There are more than two thousand words to refer to the Brazilian national distillate. Some of these nicknames are: &quot;abre-coração&quot; (heart-opener), &quot;água-benta&quot; (holy water), &quot;bafo-de-tigre&quot; (tiger breath), and &quot;limpa-olho&quot; (eye-wash).

== Difference from rum ==
In the beginning of the 17th century, the producers of sugar from various European colonies in the Americas used the by-products of sugar, molasses, and scummings as the raw material for the production of alcoholic spirits. The resulting beverage was known by several names: in British colonies, it was named &quot;rum&quot;; in France, &quot;tafia&quot;; in Spain, &quot;aguardiente de caña&quot;; and in Portugal (Brazil), &quot;aguardente da terra&quot;, &quot;aguardente de cana&quot; and later &quot;cachaça&quot; (locals also call it &quot;Pinga&quot;, which translates to drip).

The major difference between &quot;cachaça&quot; and rum is that rum is usually made from molasses, a by-product after a refinery boils the cane juice to extract as much sugar crystal as possible, while &quot;cachaça&quot; is made from fresh sugarcane juice, fermented and distilled. Some rums, in particular, the rhum agricole of the French Caribbean, are also made by the latter process. &quot;Cachaça&quot; is also known as Brazilian rum.

In the United States, &quot;cachaça&quot; is recognized as a type of rum and distinctive Brazilian product, after an agreement was signed in 2013 with Brazil in which it will drop the usage of the term &quot;Brazilian rum&quot;.

<text>Florida International University (FIU) is a public research university with its main campus in University Park, Florida, United States. Founded in 1965 by the Florida Legislature, the school opened its doors to students in 1972. FIU has grown to become the third-largest university in Florida and the eighth-largest public university in the United States by enrollment. FIU is a constituent part of the State University System of Florida and one of four state-designated Preeminent State Research Universities.

The university is classified among the Carnegie &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; institutions. FIU has 11 colleges and more than 40 centers, facilities, labs, and institutes that offer more than 200 programs of study. It has an annual budget of over $1.7 billion and an annual economic impact of over $5 billion. The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

FIU&#x27;s intercollegiate sports teams, the FIU Panthers, compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and the Conference USA (C-USA). FIU&#x27;s varsity sports teams have won five athletic championships and Panther athletes have won various individual NCAA national championships. &lt;br&gt; Jeanette Nuñez has served as interim President of FIU since 2025.

==History==
In 1943, state senator Ernest &#x27;Cap&#x27; Graham (father of future Florida governor and U.S. senator Bob Graham) presented the state legislature with the initial proposal for the establishment of a public university in Miami-Dade County. While his bill did not pass, Graham persisted in presenting his proposal to colleagues, advising them of the county&#x27;s need for a state university. He felt the establishment of a public university was necessary to serve the city&#x27;s growing population.

In 1964, Senate Bill 711 was introduced by Florida senator Robert M. Haverfield. It instructed the state Board of Education and the Board of Regents to begin planning for the development of the state university. The bill was signed into law by then-governor W. Haydon Burns in June 1965. FIU&#x27;s founding president Charles E. &quot;Chuck&quot; Perry was appointed by the board of regents in July 1969, at which time the institution was named Florida International University. At 32 years old, the new president was the youngest in the history of the State University System and, at the time, the youngest university president in the country. Perry recruited three co-founders, Butler Waugh, Donald McDowell and Nick Sileo. Alvah Chapman, Jr., former &quot;Miami Herald&quot; publisher and Knight Ridder chairman, used his civic standing and media power to assist the effort. In the 1980s, Chapman became chair of the FIU Foundation Board of Trustees.

The founders located the campus on the site of the original Tamiami Airport (not related to the later Kendall-Tamiami Airport) on the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41) between Southwest 107th and 117th Avenues, just east of where the West Dade Expressway (now the Homestead Extension of Florida&#x27;s Turnpike) was being planned. The abandoned airport&#x27;s air traffic control tower became FIU&#x27;s first building, with Perry&#x27;s office on the first floor. It originally had no telephones, no drinking water, and no furniture. Perry decided that the tower should never be destroyed, and it remains on campus, where it is now known variously as the &quot;Veterans Office,&quot; &quot;Ivory Tower,&quot; the &quot;Tower Building,&quot; or the &quot;Public Safety Tower,&quot; and is the former location of the FIU Police Department.

The groundbreaking for the Tamiami campus was held in January 1971. U Thant received FIU&#x27;s first honorary degree.

===Miami-Dade County&#x27;s public university===
In September 1972, 5,667 students entered the new state university, the largest opening day enrollment at the time. Eighty percent of the student body had just graduated from Dade County Junior College (now Miami-Dade College). A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the University of Miami and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school; Perry&#x27;s vision foresaw a &quot;no gimmicks&quot; institution with no student housing. It would be nine years before lower-division classes were added.

The first commencement, held in June 1973, took place in the reading room of the ground floor of Primera Casa–the only place large enough on campus for the ceremony. More than 1,500 family members and friends watched FIU&#x27;s first class of 191 graduates receive their diplomas. By late 1975, after seven years at the helm, Charles Perry felt he had accomplished his goal and left the university to become president and publisher of the Sunday newspaper magazine &quot;Family Weekly&quot; (later &quot;USA Weekend&quot;), one of the country&#x27;s largest magazines. When he left, there were more than 10,000 students attending classes and a campus with five major buildings and a sixth being planned.

===Crosby and Wolfe: 1976–1986===

Harold Crosby, the university&#x27;s second president and the founding president of the University of West Florida in Pensacola, agreed in 1976 to serve a three-year &quot;interim&quot; term. Under his leadership, FIU&#x27;s North Miami Campus (which was officially renamed the Bay Vista Campus in 1980, the North Miami Campus in 1987, the North Campus in 1994, and the Biscayne Bay Campus in 2000)—located on the former Interama site on Biscayne Bay—was opened in 1977. State senator Jack Gordon was instrumental in securing funding for the development of the campus. President Crosby emphasized the university&#x27;s international character, prompting the launching of new programs with an international focus and the recruitment of faculty from the Caribbean and Latin America. President Crosby&#x27;s resignation in January 1979 triggered the search for a &quot;permanent&quot; president.

Gregory Baker Wolfe, a former United States diplomat and then-president of Portland State University, became FIU&#x27;s third president, serving from 1979 to 1986. During his tenure, the institution continued to grow; it became a four-year institution, though Wolfe was criticized for not hiring enough minorities and for leading a weak private fundraising effort. After stepping down as president, Wolfe taught in the university&#x27;s international relations department. The student union on the Biscayne Bay Campus is named in his honor.

===Maidique presidency and expansion===
Modesto A. Maidique assumed the presidency at FIU in 1986, becoming the fourth in the university&#x27;s history and the first Hispanic leader of any of Florida&#x27;s state universities. Maidique graduated with a Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, and PhD in Electrical Engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), before joining the private sector. He held academic appointments from MIT, Harvard and Stanford Universities, and has been named to several US presidential boards and committees.

Under his leadership, FIU heralded in an era of unprecedented growth and prestige, with all facets of the university undergoing major transformations. Physically, the university tripled in size and its enrollment grew to nearly 40,000. During his 23 years as president, the school established the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, the FIU College of Law, the FIU School of Architecture, and the Robert Stempel School of Public Health. Also during his tenure, the endowment grew from less than $2 million to over $100 million.

During Maidique&#x27;s tenure, the university added 22 new doctoral programs. Research expenditures grew from about $6 million to nearly $110 million as defined by the National Science Foundation. In 2000, FIU attained the highest ranking in the Carnegie Foundation classification system, that of &quot;Doctoral/Research University-Extensive.&quot; FIU&#x27;s faculty has engaged in research and holds far-reaching expertise in reducing morbidity and mortality from cancer, HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, diabetes and other diseases, and change the approaches to the delivery of health care by medical, public health, nursing and other healthcare professionals, hurricane mitigation, climate change, nano-technologies, forensic sciences, and the development of biomedical devices. The arts also flourished while Maidique was at the helm, with the university acquiring The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum on Miami Beach and building the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum on its main campus. In athletics, FIU made inroads in becoming a powerhouse athletic university during Maidique&#x27;s time as president; he unilaterally changed the mascot from the Sunblazers to the Golden Panthers early in his tenure, and he championed the eventual establishment of an NCAA football program. Finally, the school earned membership into Phi Beta Kappa, the nation&#x27;s oldest honor society.

Maidique was the second longest-serving research university president in the nation. Now President Emeritus, he serves as the Alvah H. Chapman, Jr., Eminent Scholar Chair in Leadership, and Professor of Management at FIU.

===Rosenberg presidency===


On November 14, 2008, Maidique announced that he would be stepping down and asked FIU&#x27;s board of trustees to begin the search of a new president. He said he would remain president until a new one was found. On April 25, 2009, Mark B. Rosenberg was selected to become FIU&#x27;s fifth president. He signed a five-year contract with the board of trustees. On August 29, 2009, Rosenberg became FIU&#x27;s fifth president.
Having begun as a two-year upper division university, FIU has grown into a much larger traditional university and serves international students. More than $600 million has been invested in campus construction, with the addition of new residence halls, the FIU Stadium, recreation center, student center, and Greek life mansions, as well as the fielding of the Division I-A Golden Panthers football team in 2002.

Since 1986, the university established its School of Architecture, College of Law and College of Medicine (named the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in 1999 after Herbert Wertheim donated $20 million to the college, which was matched by state funds and is the largest donation in the university&#x27;s history), and acquired the historic Wolfsonian-FIU Museum in Miami Beach. FIU now emphasizes research as a major component of its mission and is now classed as a &quot;very high research activity&quot; university under the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Sponsored research funding (grants and contracts) from external sources for the year 2007–2008 totaled some $110 million. FIU has a budget of over $649 million. The Florida International University School of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management collaborated with the Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China to work on preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics. FIU was the only university in the United States invited to do so.

In December 2013, it was announced Royal Caribbean was building a $20 million 130,000 sq. ft. training facility for its performers at the school. The facility opened in March 2015. The complex serves architecture, art, and hospitality students and includes lighting, set design, marketing, and other internship and training opportunities. On March 15, 2018, a newly constructed pedestrian bridge collapsed outside the university, resulting in six fatalities. On May 6, 2020, Florida Department of Transportation announced plans to design and rebuild the bridge.

Rosenberg suddenly resigned from the university effective January 21, 2022, citing deteriorating health conditions of his wife. Just a week later it was revealed that he stepped down because of allegations that he had made advances to a younger female employee, &quot;causing discomfort,&quot; and creating a hostile work environment. Rosenberg is currently a professor of political science and international relations at the Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs at FIU.

===Jessell presidency===
Rosenberg was succeeded by Kenneth A. Jessell as president, previously FIU&#x27;s chief financial officer and senior vice president for finance and administration. Jessell was selected as FIU&#x27;s sixth president on October 17, 2022 by FIU&#x27;s board of trustees and was confirmed by the Florida Board of Governors on November 9, 2022.

In April 2024, students at Florida International University started protesting and  set up a &quot;liberated zone&quot; in support of Palestinians in Gaza, joining other campuses nationwide.  With Florida Governor De Santis strongly condemning the protests and threatening to deport foreign students, the ACLU of Florida weighed in with a statement supporting the students right to protest. FIU students cited the threats by the government for staying away from the protests. The protesters called for an end to &quot;the siege on Gaza” and the U.S. providing funding and arms to Israel. 

Jessell&#x27;s three year contract ended in 2025 and he was replaced by Florida&#x27;s lieutenant governor and FIU alumna 
Jeanette Nuñez as interim president on February 17, 2025.

==Campus==

Florida International&#x27;s 344-acre (139 ha) campus is in the neighborhood of University Park in the census-designated place of Westchester in an unincorporated area of western Miami-Dade County, Florida. The Modesto A. Maidique Campus (&quot;MMC&quot;)—formerly called University Park but renamed in 2009—encompasses . The MMC houses almost all of the university&#x27;s colleges and schools as well as all the administrative offices and main university facilities. MMC is also home to the Ronald Reagan Presidential House, the home of FIU&#x27;s president; the Wertheim Performing Arts Center; the Frost Art Museum; the International Hurricane Research Center; and the university&#x27;s athletic facilities such as FIU Stadium, FIU Arena, and the FIU Baseball Stadium.

The postal address of the Modesto Maidique campus is in &quot;Miami, Florida&quot; and the ZIP code is 33199, while the campus is physically in the Westchester census-designated place as of the 2020 U.S. Census. In the 1990 U.S. Census it was in the Olympia Heights CDP. In the 2000 U.S. Census and the 2010 U.S. Census that campus was in the University Park CDP.

The site of the campus was originally used for a general aviation airport called Tamiami Airport (not to be confused with Kendall-Tamiami Airport), which was in operation from the 1940s until 1967, when it relocated to a new site. The airport had three runways and was used for pilot training, among other purposes. The original campus was named the Tamiami Campus, after the nearby Tamiami Trail highway and the former airport, until being designated the University Park Campus in 1987.

Until the early 1990s, the runways, parking ramp, and other features of Tamiami Airport were still visible on campus and clearly discernible in aerial photos. Construction has removed all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university&#x27;s past. University Park is a heavily vegetated campus, with many lakes, a 15-acre nature preserve, and a palm arboretum, with over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.

On June 12, 2009, FIU&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously to rename the University Park campus to the Modesto Maidique Campus; the university had considered naming the law school in his honor but decided not to because that would preclude a future charitable donation to name the school. The change created a large backlash from the FIU community, as many felt it unfitting to name the campus after him. A campaign by FIU students and alumni was created to revert the name change, and to keep the name University Park. A Facebook group, &quot;No to Maidique&#x27;s Campus&quot; with over 2,000 supporters has made national news, in many newspapers, TV news stations, and collegiate magazines, supporting to keep the name &quot;University Park&quot;.

===Engineering Center===

Located five blocks north of Modesto A. Maidique, is the 38-acre (15.3 ha) Engineering Center which houses a part of the College of Engineering and Computing and is the home of FIU&#x27;s Motorola Nanofabrication Research Facility. The Engineering Center is serviced by the CATS Shuttle, FIU&#x27;s student buses, which run throughout the day on weekdays connecting the two parts of campus.

Carlos Finlay Elementary School, of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools, is on the FIU Maidique Campus. The National Weather Service Miami Office is also on FIU property. Both Finlay ES and the Hurricane Center are subleased.

===Biscayne Bay Campus===
The Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC) in North Miami is Florida International&#x27;s 200-acre (91 ha) waterfront branch campus. It was opened in 1977 by Harold Crosby and occupies land, directly on the bay and adjacent to the Oleta River State Park, with which FIU has a research partnership. Access to these resources inspired the creation of a marine biology program on the Biscayne Bay Campus, which has become one of the university&#x27;s most recognized programs. The Biscayne Bay Campus also houses the School of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Management, the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, the Aquatic Center, and the Kovens Conference Center. The Golden Panther Express, FIU&#x27;s student buses, connect the main campus and the Biscayne Bay Campus throughout the day on weekdays.

On the Biscayne Bay Campus, FIU offers housing through Bayview Student Living apartments. BBC&#x27;s first on-campus new housing in 30+ years houses 408 students in a high rise overlooking Biscayne Bay. Through FIU&#x27;s Panther Express Shuttle, current students travel free between campuses.

===Regional centers===
FIU also has other smaller regional centers located throughout South Florida in both Miami-Dade County and Broward County, serving the local communities in research, continuing studies, and in culture. In Miami-Dade County, there are four regional FIU facilities, the Downtown Miami Center, the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum in Miami Beach (Washington Avenue and 10th St), the FIU-Florida Memorial research center in Miami Gardens, and a research site in Homestead.

====FIU at I-75====
The FIU at I-75 academic center is a satellite campus located in Miramar, which borders Pembroke Pines and the southernmost portion of Interstate 75 in Broward County. It finished construction in 2014 and is used to satisfy overwhelming demand from Broward County students and shares a building with Broward College. The campus houses an 89,000-sqft. complex and offers courses and programs from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, College of Business, College of Education, and the College of Engineering &amp; Computing. This campus is also equipped with offices, a computer lab, student lounges, and study spaces for students.

====Downtown Miami Center====

FIU has a center on Brickell Avenue in Downtown Miami at 1101 Brickell Avenue dubbed &quot;FIU Downtown on Brickell&quot;. FIU&#x27;s College of Business Administration has had classes at the Burdines Building on Flagler Street and the Metropolitan Center had offices at 150 SE 2nd Ave since 2004. In August 2011, FIU expanded its Downtown center to 1101 Brickell with the expansion of course offerings for the College of Business Administration and the School of International and Public Affairs, as well as with FIU&#x27;s research center, the Metropolitan Center. Most programs in Downtown are graduate-level evening courses geared for Downtown professionals and residents. As of Spring 2011, there were approximately 500 students enrolled at the Downtown center, with plans to grow the center to over 2,000 students by 2021.

====Global Forensic and Justice Center, Largo====
Founded in 2018, it combines two decades of experience to engage the forensic science and criminal justice industries from the crime scene to the courtroom.
Located at: Bryan Dairy Road, Largo, Florida .

==Organization and administration==

FIU belongs to the 12-campus State University System of Florida and is one of Florida&#x27;s primary graduate research universities, awarding over 3,400 graduate and professional degrees annually. The university offers 191 programs of study with more than 280 majors in 23 colleges and schools. FIU offers many graduate programs, including architecture, business administration, engineering, law, and medicine, offering 81 master&#x27;s degrees, 34 doctoral degrees, and 3 professional degrees.

===Student government===
The Student Government Association presides over and funds the over 300 student clubs, organizations, and honor societies at the university and has an operating budget of about $20 million each year. The Student Government Association is split into three branches. The Executive branch consists of the Student Body President and Vice President, who are chosen in a university-wide election, and well as the Governor of the Biscayne Bay Campus, who is chosen in an election of students pertaining to that campus. The Executive branch also contains the Cabinet of the Student Body President. The Legislative branch consists of the Student Body Senate. The Judicial branch consists of the Supreme Court. The Student Body President serves as a member of the FIU Board of Trustees, while the Student Body Vice President serves as a member of the FIU Foundation&#x27;s Board of Directors.

The Student Government oversees several Agencies which provide programming to the student body: the Homecoming Council, the Student Programming Council, Panther Power, and the Registered Student Organizations Council, which is responsible for registering the over 300 student organizations and distributing funding allocated by the Student Government. Panther Power is the student spirit group, and it can be seen in all FIU athletic events alongside the Band, the Dazzlers dance team, and the cheerleaders. In addition, the Student Government oversees several Bureaus which provide community for identity groups on campus, including the Black Student Union and the Pride Student Union.

====Libraries====
The Green Library is FIU&#x27;s main library and the largest building on campus. Originally designed by Architect David M. Harper in 1973, the Green Library was expanded by the architecture firm M. C. Harry &amp; Associates, Inc. in the early 1990s to its current eight floors, with a capacity to expand to a total of 15 floors, if necessary. The eight-floor structure was built over, through, and around the original three-story library while it was still in use.

The first floor has classrooms, auditorium spaces, and support services for students, such as tutoring, the writing center, and technology assistance. Also on the first floor is an Auntie Anne&#x27;s and a Starbucks. The second floor has the reference section, cartography (GIS Center), circulation, and numerous computer and printing labs. The third floor is the home of the Medical Library, and includes study lounges as well as a resource center for students of the Honors College. The fourth floor houses the special collections department and university archives. The fifth floor is the home of the School of Architecture Library, as well as the music and audiovisual collections. The sixth and seventh floors are strictly quiet floors, and contain the general book collection along with numerous student study lounges. The eighth floor contains the library&#x27;s administration offices and technical services departments.

The FIU Engineering Library is located on the second floor of the main building of the Engineering Center. The FIU Law Library opened in 2002, and has three floors, with all three holding the library&#x27;s general collection. The third floor has a two-story, quiet reading room, as well as numerous study lounges. Although the Law Library is restricted to Law students, other students may use the library for research purposes. The FIU Medical Library opened in August 2009 at the same time as the opening of the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine. The Medical Library is currently located on the third floor of Green Library building. Future construction of buildings for the College of Medicine will include a new space for the Medical Library outside of Green Library, based upon funding and space availability.

The Glenn Hubert Library, previously named the Biscayne Bay Library, is a smaller three-story structure serving the Biscayne Bay Campus. All services at the Green Library are available in the Hubert Library. The Wolfsonian Library is located at the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum in South Beach, on the corner of Washington Avenue and 10th Street. The collection focuses exclusively on architecture, art, design, and history of the Western World from 1885 to 1945. The library serves mostly as a research library with an extensive collection of primary sources.

==Research==

Florida International University spent $246 million in annual research expenditures and was awarded $310 million in research awards for fiscal year 2021.

Not to be confused with the National Hurricane Center (also located at University Park), the IHRC is located on the western side of the campus.

==Student life==

===Traditions===

FIU has many traditions from student spirit groups, alumni association events, and student spirit events. Incoming students can attend Panther Camp, originally a weekend retreat in the summer and now a two-day on-campus event, which began in 2006. Week of Welcome, usually held the first or second week of the fall semester, holds many spirit events, such as Trail of the Torch, when the torch of knowledge in front of the Primera Casa building is lit on campus.


===Residential life===

Florida International University&#x27;s student housing facilities are managed by the Office of Housing and Residential Life located on the Modesto Maidique Campus (MMC). There are 3,300 students living on campus throughout 10 apartment buildings and 6 residence halls. Students reside in the following buildings: University Apartments, Panther Hall, University Towers, Everglades Hall, Lakeview Hall North, Lakeview Hall South, Honors College @ Parkview Hall, and Tamiami Hall. All rooms are suite style or apartment style and none of the buildings have community bathrooms.

On the Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC), FIU offers housing through Bayview Student Living apartments. BBC&#x27;s first on-campus new housing in 30+ years houses 408 students in a high rise overlooking Biscayne Bay. Through FIU&#x27;s Panther Express Shuttle, current students travel free between campuses. The Office of Housing and Residential Life also offers optional communities in the residence halls known as Living Learning Communities (LLCs). These communities offer residents the opportunity to live with individuals of the same major or interest; including, Business, Changemakers, Engineering, Global Engagement, and Honors Place for Honors College students.

===Arts and culture===

FIU has three museums, the Frost Art Museum, the Wolfsonian-FIU Museum and the Jewish Museum of Florida. The Frost Art Museum is located on Modesto A. Maidique campus and was opened in 1977 as The Art Museum at Florida International University. The Frost Art Museum&#x27;s Permanent Collection consists of a broad array of art objects from ancient cultural artifacts to contemporary works of art. The Wolfsonian-FIU Museum is located in Miami Beach and promotes the collection, preservation and understanding of decorative art and design from the period from 1885 to 1945. FIU also has a large sculpture collection, named the Sculpture Park at FIU, with sculptures from such prominent artists as Anthony Caro, Jacques Lipchitz, Daniel Joseph Martinez, and Tony Rosenthal. Many different art structures, statues, paintings and mosaics can be seen throughout campus in gardens, buildings, walkways, and on walls.

The School of Music presents an annual series of concerts in a variety of genres, as well as learning facilities and opportunities for musicians. The concert season incorporates music of all styles including jazz, early music, chamber music, choral/vocal, contemporary music, wind, and opera theater performed by world class musicians and ensembles. Many masterclasses and lectures are also open to the public and offered at no charge. The season runs from August through April each year.

The Department of Theatre presents a season of four professionally designed, produced, and directed productions each year that serve as a laboratory for students. Its Main Stage season is presented at the Herbert and Nicole Wertheim Performing Arts Center. In addition to Main Stage productions, students write, direct and perform productions in the Student Theatre Lab Studio. The department hosts The Green House during the summer months, a development project of a new work by an established playwright. In the past, summers have also included additional department productions, student-directed pieces, Alumni showcases and reunion productions. The Florida International University School of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Managementhosts the Annual Food Network South Beach Wine &amp; Food Festival in South Beach, a major national culinary event.

===Order of the Torch===
The Order of the Torch is a semi-secret honorary leadership society akin to other secret societies in the state such as Florida Blue Key at the University of Florida and the Iron Arrow Honor Society at the University of Miami. The organization is rumored to have been founded in 2003 as a way of organizing student leadership to restructure student life to mirror that of a traditional university. Members now include students, faculty, staff and community members, including FIU alumni Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Alvarez (class of 1974). Top leadership in Student Government, Homecoming, and the most elite campus fraternal organizations rank among its members.

===Greek life===
Approximately 1,100 undergraduate students, or approximately 2% of the entire undergraduate study body, are members of either a fraternity or sorority. The Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life at Florida International University is separated into four divisions: Interfraternity Council (IFC), National Panhellenic Conference (NPC), Multicultural Greek Council (MGC), and the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC). The Order of Omega, a Greek honor society, has had a chapter at the university since 1991 and represents the academic top three percent of FIU Greeks.

The Interfraternity Council (IFC) comprises 12 fraternities, and the Panhellenic Council is made up of 7 sororities. The Multicultural Greek Council consists of 7 cultural organizations (Latino, Asian, South Asian, etc.), three fraternities and four sororities. The National Pan-Hellenic Council comprises nine historically black organizations, five fraternities and four sororities. There are 29 Academic Honor Societies as well Greek service organizations for students such as Phi Delta Epsilon. In December 2017, Greek life activities were temporarily paused by the university in the wake of a series of hazing events nationally and the discovery of a group chat of Tau Kappa Epsilon members that contained photos of nude women. TKE and two other institutions, Phi Gamma Delta (&quot;Fiji&quot;) and Pi Kappa Phi, were suspended when the university allowed fraternities and sororities to resume. FIU obtained the property of the Greek houses occupied by the latter two fraternities, the only such houses on campus.

===Campus and area transportation===

The main campus is located on the south side of the Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41/SW 8th Street) between SW 107th and SW 117th Avenue next to Florida&#x27;s Turnpike and near the western terminus of the Dolphin Expressway. Miami-Dade Transit serves University Park with Metrobus lines 8, 11, 24, and 71. Metrobus lines 75 and 135 serve the Biscayne Bay Campus. Bus lines 8, 11 and the 24 directly connect FIU with Downtown Miami.

Two distinct FIU-operated bus lines are available. The CATS Shuttle runs between University Park and the Engineering Center, and the Golden Panther Express, from University Park to the Biscayne Bay Campus. The CATS Shuttle connects University Park from the Graham Center bus stop and the Engineering and Computer Sciences Building, to the Engineering Center on Flagler Street and 107th Avenue. There have long been plans for Metrorail, the local heavy rail rapid transit system to be extended west, with two proposed lines terminating at Florida International University&#x27;s main campus. This would ease traffic and parking problems at and around the main campus.

===Student media===


FIU Student Media includes &quot;PantherNOW&quot;, the student newspaper and its accompanying website, and FIU&#x27;s radio station, WRGP.

&quot;PantherNOW&quot; is the FIU student newspaper, founded in 1972 and having printed under various titles. &quot;PantherNOW&quot; is published in print form monthly and also maintains a website, PantherNOW.com. WRGP &quot;The Roar&quot;, with antecedents dating to 1988 and broadcasting on FM since 1999, is FIU&#x27;s student-run radio station, with transmitters in Homestead and on the Maidique and Biscayne Bay campuses.

==In television and entertainment==
FIU&#x27;s campus has been the set for many films, television shows, and music videos. One of the earliest television shows to have filmed at FIU was &quot;Miami Vice&quot;; an episode partially filmed in the then-brand-new Sunblazer Arena was recorded in 1986, just after its opening. The TV show &quot;Burn Notice&quot; has also filmed various episodes at FIU, with scenes at the College of Business Buildings and the Diaz-Balart College of Law Building.

In October 2009, former CNN news anchor Rick Sanchez broadcast his CNN show from the Graham Center at FIU. Three years later, in 2012, G4TV held the Northeast and Southeast regional qualifying rounds of the television show American Ninja Warrior at FIU. The competition took place in the traffic loop between the School of Architecture and the College of Business. Three years after that, in 2015, Florida International University hosted the Miss Universe 2014 pageant in the FIU Arena.

Traditional rivals of the FIU Panthers include Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami. The Panthers football team competes in the Shula Bowl, an annual football game played for the Don Shula Award against in-state rival Florida Atlantic University. Due to this competition, the rivalry between the two schools has grown, with the rivalry extending into the men&#x27;s baseball and basketball teams as well.

The Panthers football team plays home games at Riccardo Silva Stadium, nicknamed &quot;The Cage&quot;. In 2005, the Panthers moved to the Sun Belt Conference, making their transition from Division I-FCS to Division I-FBS complete. In their first season in the conference, the Panthers began by finishing 5–6. The football program has one conference title to date—in 2010, when it won the Sun Belt Conference title and played in the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl against Toledo, winning late in the fourth quarter. The FIU men&#x27;s basketball team has one NCAA tournament appearance to its record.

<doc id="387851" wikidata="Q116732893" url="?curid=387851" title="Social construct">
<text>A social construct is any category or thing that is made real by convention or collective agreement. Socially constructed realities are contrasted with natural kinds, which exist independently of human behavior or beliefs.

Simple examples of social constructs are the &quot;meaning&quot; of words, the &quot;value&quot; of paper money, and the &quot;rules&quot; of economic systems. Other examples, such as &quot;race&quot;, were formerly considered controversial but are now accepted by the consensus of scientists to be socially constructed rather than naturally determined. Still other possible examples, such as less empirical and more abstract &quot;concepts&quot; which underlie particular scientific theories, remain the subject of ongoing philosophical debate.

== Relationship with objectivity ==

During the 20th century, philosopher John Searle and sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann argued that some socially constructed realities—such as property ownership, citizenship, and marital status—should be considered forms of objective fact, and posited the existence of such socially constructed objective facts as a philosophical or methodological problem to be explored.

Others, such as György Lukács, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer built upon the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche and Karl Marx to argue that a fallacy of reification is responsible for the practice of treating socially constructed facts as though they were natural—a phenomenon Lukács referred to as &quot;phantom objectivity&quot;.

More recently, biological anthropologists and public health experts have determined that, while race is a social construct, the persistence of racism has objectively demonstrable negative consequences for the health and well-being of marginalized groups.

<text>George Armitage Miller (February 3, 1920 – July 22, 2012) was an American psychologist who was one of the founders of cognitive psychology, and more broadly, of cognitive science. He also contributed to the birth of psycholinguistics. Miller wrote several books and directed the development of WordNet, an online word-linkage database usable by computer programs. He authored the paper, &quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two,&quot; in which he observed that many different experimental findings considered together reveal the presence of an average limit of seven for human short-term memory capacity. This paper is frequently cited by psychologists and in the wider culture. Miller won numerous awards, including the National Medal of Science.

Miller began his career when the reigning theory in psychology was behaviorism, which eschewed the study of mental processes and focused on observable behavior. Rejecting this approach, Miller devised experimental techniques and mathematical methods to analyze mental processes, focusing particularly on speech and language. Working mostly at Harvard University, MIT and Princeton University, he went on to become one of the founders of psycholinguistics and was one of the key figures in founding the broader new field of cognitive science, . He collaborated and co-authored work with other figures in cognitive science and psycholinguistics, such as Noam Chomsky. For moving psychology into the realm of mental processes and for aligning that move with information theory, computation theory, and linguistics, Miller is considered one of the great twentieth-century psychologists. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Miller as the 20th most cited psychologist of that era.

== Biography ==
Miller was born on February 3, 1920, in Charleston, West Virginia, the son of George E. Miller, a steel company executive and Florence (née Armitage) Miller. Soon after his birth, his parents divorced, and he lived with his mother during the Great Depression, attending public school and graduating from Charleston High School in 1937. He moved with his mother and stepfather to Washington, D.C., and attended George Washington University for a year. His family practiced Christian Science, which required turning to prayer, rather than medical science, for healing. After his stepfather was transferred to Birmingham, Alabama, Miller transferred to the University of Alabama.

At the University of Alabama he took courses in phonetics, voice science, and speech pathology, earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and speech in 1940, and a master&#x27;s in a speech in 1941. Membership in the Drama club had fostered his interest in courses in the Speech Department. He was also influenced by Professor Donald Ramsdell, who introduced him both to psychology, and, indirectly through a seminar, to his future wife Katherine James. They married on November 29, 1939. Katherine died in January 1996. He married Margaret Ferguson Skutch Page in 2008.

Miller taught the course &quot;Introduction to Psychology&quot; at Alabama for two years. He enrolled in the Ph.D. program in psychology at Harvard University in 1943, after coming to the university in 1942. At Harvard he worked in Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory, under the supervision of Stanley Smith Stevens, researching military voice communications for the Army Signal Corps during World War II. He received his doctorate in 1946; his doctoral thesis, &quot;The Optimal Design of Jamming Signals,&quot; was classified top secret by the US Army.

=== Career ===
After receiving his doctorate, Miller stayed at Harvard as a research fellow, continuing his research on speech and hearing. He was appointed an assistant professor of psychology in 1948. The course he developed on language and communication eventually led to his first major book, &quot;Language and communication&quot; (1951). He took a sabbatical in 1950, and spent a year as a visiting fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, to pursue his interest in mathematics. Miller befriended J. Robert Oppenheimer, with whom he played squash. In 1951, Miller joined MIT as an associate professor of psychology. He led the psychology group at the MIT Lincoln Lab and worked on voice communication and human engineering. A notable outcome of this research was his identification of the minimal voice features of speech required for it to be intelligible. Based on this work, in 1955, he was invited to talk at the Eastern Psychological Association. That presentation, &quot;The magical number seven, plus or minus two&quot;, was later published as a paper which went on to be a legendary one in cognitive psychology.

Miller moved back to Harvard as a tenured associate professor in 1955 and became a full professor in 1958, expanding his research into how language affects human cognition. At the university, he met a young Noam Chomsky, another of the founders of cognitive science. They spent a summer together at Stanford, where their two families shared a house. In 1958–59, Miller took leave to join the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Palo Alto, California, (now at Stanford University). There he collaborated with Eugene Galanter and Karl Pribram on the book &quot;Plans and the Structure of Behavior&quot;. In 1960, along with Jerome S. Bruner, he co-founded the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard. The cognitive term was a break from the then-dominant school of behaviorism, which insisted cognition was not fit for scientific study. The center attracted such notable visitors as Jean Piaget, Alexander Luria and Chomsky. Miller then became the chair of the psychology department. Miller was instrumental at the time for recruiting Timothy Leary to teach at Harvard. Miller knew Leary from the University of Alabama, where Miller was teaching psychology and Leary graduated with an undergraduate degree from the department.

In 1967, Miller taught at Rockefeller University for a year, as a visiting professor, From 1968 to 1979, he was Professor at the Rockefeller and continued as adjunct professor there from 1979 to 1982. Following the election of a new president at Rockefeller Miller moved to Princeton University as the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Psychology. At Princeton he helped to found (in 1986) the Cognitive Science Laboratory, and also directed the McDonnell-Pew Program in Cognitive Science.. Eventually, he became a professor emeritus and senior research psychologist at Princeton. 
Miller had honorary doctorates from the University of Sussex (1984), Columbia University (1980), Yale University (1979), Catholic University of Louvain (1978), Carnegie Mellon University (in humane letters, 2003), and an honorary DSC from Williams College (2000). He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1957, the National Academy of Sciences in 1962, the presidency of the Eastern Psychological Association in 1962, the presidency of the American Psychological Association in 1969, the American Philosophical Society in 1971, and to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1985. Miller was the keynote speaker at the first convention of the Association for Psychological Science in 1989. He was a Fulbright research fellow at Oxford University in 1964–65, and in 1991, received the National Medal of Science.

===Death===
In his later years, Miller enjoyed playing golf. He died in 2012 at his home in Plainsboro, New Jersey of complications of pneumonia and dementia. At the time of his death, he was survived by his wife Margaret; the children from his first marriage: son Donnally James and daughter Nancy Saunders; two stepsons, David Skutch and Christopher Skutch; and three grandchildren: Gavin Murray-Miller, Morgan Murray-Miller and Nathaniel James Miller.

== Major contributions ==

Miller began his career in a period during which behaviorism dominated research psychology. It was argued that observable processes are the proper subject matter of science, that behavior is observable and mental processes are not. Thus, mental processes were not a fit topic for study. Miller disagreed. He and others such Jerome Bruner and Noam Chomsky founded the field of Cognitive Psychology, which accepted the study of mental processes as fundamental to an understanding of complex behavior. In succeeding years, this cognitive approach largely replaced behaviorism as the framework governing research in psychology.

=== Working memory ===
From the days of William James, psychologists had distinguished short-term from long-term memory. While short-term memory seemed to be limited, its limits were not known. In 1956, Miller put a number on that limit in the paper &quot;The magical number seven, plus or minus two&quot;. He derived this number from tasks such as asking a person to repeat a set of digits, presenting a stimulus and a label and requiring recall of the label, or asking the person to quickly count things in a group. In all three cases, Miller found the average limit to be seven items. He later had mixed feelings about this work, feeling that it had been often been misquoted, and he jokingly suggested that he was being persecuted by an integer. Miller invented the term chunk to characterize the way that individuals could cope with this limitation on memory, effectively reducing the number of elements by grouping them. A chunk might be a single letter or a familiar word or even a larger familiar unit. These and related ideas strongly influenced the budding field of cognitive psychology.

=== WordNet ===
For many years starting from 1986, Miller directed the development of WordNet, a large computer-readable electronic reference usable in applications such as search engines, which was created by a team that included Christiane Fellbaum, among others. Wordnet is a large lexical database representing human semantic memory in English. Its fundamental building block is a synset, which is a collection of synonyms representing a concept or idea. Words can be in multiple synsets. The entire class of synsets is grouped into nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs separately, with links existing only within these four major groups but not between them. Going beyond a thesaurus, WordNet also includes inter-word relationships such as part/whole relationships and hierarchies of inclusion.Although not intended to be a dictionary, Wordnet did have many short definitions added to it as time went on. Miller and colleagues had planned the tool to test psycholinguistic theories on how humans use and understand words. Miller also later worked closely with entrepreneur Jeff Stibel and scientists at Simpli.com Inc., on a meaning-based keyword search engine based on WordNet. Wordnet has proved to be extremely influential on an international scale. It has now been emulated by wordnets in many different languages.

=== Psychology of language ===
Miller is one of the founders of psycholinguistics, which links language and cognition in the analysis of language creation and usage. His 1951 book &quot;Language and Communication&quot; is considered seminal in the field. His later book, &quot;The Science of Words&quot; (1991) also focused on the psychology of language. Together with Noam Chomsky he published papers on the mathematical and computational aspects of language and its syntax, two new areas of study. Miller also studied the human understanding of words and sentences, a problem also faced by artificial speech-recognition technology. The book &quot;Plans and the Structure of Behavior&quot; (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, explored how humans plan and act, trying to extrapolate this to how a robot could be programmed to plan and act. Miller is also known for coining Miller&#x27;s Law: &quot;In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume it is true and try to imagine what it could be true of&quot;.

== Books ==
Miller authored several books, many considered the first major works in their respective fields.

=== &quot;Language and Communication&quot;, 1951 ===
Miller&#x27;s &quot;Language and Communication&quot; was one of the first significant texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon&#x27;s information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.

Reviewing the book, Charles E. Osgood classified the book as a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others not directly related to the author&#x27;s expertise area. He was also critical of Miller&#x27;s use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.

=== &quot;Plans and the Structure of Behavior&quot;, 1960 ===
In &quot;Plans and the Structure of Behavior&quot;, Miller and his co-authors tried to explain through an artificial-intelligence computational perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of stimulus-response actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman&#x27;s cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its initial test phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.

Peter Milner, in a review in the &quot;Canadian Journal of Psychology&quot;, noted the book was short on concrete details on implementing the TOTE strategy. He also critically viewed the book as not being able to tie its model to details from neurophysiology at a molecular level. Per him, the book covered only the brain at the gross level of lesion studies, showing that some of its regions could possibly implement some TOTE strategies, without giving a reader an indication as to &quot;how&quot; the region could implement the strategy.

=== &quot;The Psychology of Communication&quot;, 1967 ===
Miller&#x27;s 1967 work, &quot;The Psychology of Communication&quot;, was a collection of seven previously published articles. The first &quot;Information and Memory&quot; dealt with chunking, presenting the idea of separating physical length (the number of items presented to be learned) and psychological length (the number of ideas the recipient manages to categorize and summarize the items with). Capacity of short-term memory was measured in units of psychological length, arguing against a pure behaviorist interpretation since meaning of items, beyond reinforcement and punishment, was central to psychological length.

The second essay was the paper on magical number seven. The third, &#x27;The human link in communication systems,&#x27; used information theory and its idea of channel capacity to analyze human perception bandwidth. The essay concluded how much of what impinges on us we can absorb as knowledge was limited, for each property of the stimulus, to a handful of items. The paper on &quot;Psycholinguists&quot; described how effort in both speaking or understanding a sentence was related to how much of self-reference to similar-structures-present-inside was there when the sentence was broken down into clauses and phrases. The book, in general, used the Chomskian view of seeing language rules of grammar as having a biological basis—disproving the simple behaviorist idea that language performance improved with reinforcement—and using the tools of information and computation to place hypotheses on a sound theoretical framework and to analyze data practically and efficiently. Miller specifically addressed experimental data refuting the behaviorist framework at concept level in the field of language and cognition. He noted this only qualified behaviorism at the level of cognition, and did not overthrow it in other spheres of psychology.

== Legacy ==
The Cognitive Neuroscience Society established a George A. Miller Prize in 1995 for contributions to the field. The American Psychological Association established a George A. Miller Award in 1995 for an outstanding article on general psychology. From 1987 the department of psychology at Princeton University has presented the George A. Miller prize annually to the best interdisciplinary senior thesis in cognitive science. The paper on the magical number seven continues to be cited by both the popular press to explain the liking for seven-digit phone numbers and to argue against nine-digit zip codes, and by academia, especially modern psychology, to highlight its break with the behaviorist paradigm.

Miller was considered the 20th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century in a list republished by, among others, the American Psychological Association.

<doc id="387854" wikidata="Q703910" url="?curid=387854" title="Singapore sling">
<text>The Singapore sling is a gin-based sling cocktail from Singapore. This long drink was reputed to have been developed in 1915 by Ngiam Tong Boon (), a bartender at the Long Bar in Raffles Hotel, Singapore. It was initially called the gin sling.

==History==
The drink was created sometime between 1899 and 1915 at Raffles Hotel. Simon Difford wrote that the drink was originally Ngiam&#x27;s &quot;house&quot; version of the gin sling. It was socially unacceptable for women to drink alcohol in public at that time, so Ngiam made the cocktail look like fruit juice to enable women to drink it. On the other hand, David Wondrich of &quot;Esquire&quot; claimed that the drink was created in the 1890s and wasn&#x27;t related to the Raffles until the 1920s.

The original recipe of the Singapore sling is debated. This is because the original recipe was lost after the 1930s when the hotel stopped serving the drink. D. A. Embury stated in the &quot;Fine Art of Mixing Drinks&quot;: &quot;Of all the recipes published for [this drink] I have never seen any two that were alike.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; described the &quot;original recipe&quot; as a mixture of two measures of gin with one of cherry brandy and one each of orange, pineapple, and lime juice. The hotel&#x27;s recipe was recreated based on a 1936 note by a visitor.

The Long Bar at Raffles Hotel sells 800-1200 Singapore slings every day. 70% of the total revenue of the bar comes from the sling, which earns the bar S$15 million in annual sales.

==Today==

By the 1980s, in countries such as the United States, the Singapore sling was often little more than gin, bottled sour mix, and grenadine, a mixture showing very little relationship to the recipe used elsewhere under the same name. By that time both in the Raffles Hotel and Hong Kong, and generally in the UK, the recipe had remained standardised as gin and cherry brandy (in various ratios between 2:1 and 1:2). By 2000, Bénédictine was introduced and pineapple juice used more. In New Orleans, sometimes Hurricane mix was used instead of pineapple.

==Gin slings==
The gin sling, attested from 1790, described a North American drink of gin, which was flavoured, sweetened, and served cold. The &quot;Singapore sling&quot; has been documented as early as 1930 as a recipe in the &quot;Savoy Cocktail Book&quot;: Ingredients one-quarter lemon juice, one-quarter dry gin, one-half cherry brandy: &quot;Shake well and strain into medium-sized glass, and fill with soda water. Add 1 lump of ice&quot;.

This recipe persisted for decades and is recalled in 1982 in &quot;The Sainsbury Book of Cocktails &amp; Party Drinks&quot;, where it is also called the Singapore sling and was the classic recipe of the time. A minor difference occurs in that the measures of the spirits were twice the quantity compared with the lemon and soda of the 1930 quotation and garnished with slice of lemon and a glacé cherry. These two very similar forms represent a traditional British version of the Singapore sling.

Also documented in &quot;The Sainsbury Book of Cocktails &amp; Party Drinks&quot; is the Straits sling (also a Raffles Hotel invention named after the nearby Singapore Strait), which was even stronger, but also added Bénédictine, Angostura bitters, and orange bitters, but its garnish was both lemon and orange slices and it did not have the glacé cherry.

&quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; (&quot;Brewer&#x27;s&quot;) refers to the gin sling as &quot;a drink mainly composed of gin and lemon&quot; and states that it has been attributed to bartender John Collins of London, &quot;but it dates from before his time and was found in the U.S.A. by 1800&quot;, which is similar to the John Collins, another cocktail of gin and lemon.

<doc id="387857" wikidata="Q57656" url="?curid=387857" title="Erwin Panofsky">
<text>Erwin Panofsky (March 30, 1892 – March 14, 1968) was a German-Jewish art historian, whose academic career was pursued mostly in the U.S. after the rise of the Nazi regime.

His work represents a high point in the modern academic study of iconography, including his hugely influential &quot;Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art&quot; and his masterpiece &quot;Early Netherlandish Painting&quot;. Many of his books are still in print, including &quot;Studies in Iconology: Humanist Themes in the Art of the Renaissance&quot; (1939), &quot;Meaning in the Visual Arts&quot; (1955), and his 1943 study &quot;The Life and Art of Albrecht Dürer&quot;.

Panofsky&#x27;s ideas were highly influential in intellectual history in general, particularly in his use of historical ideas to interpret artworks and vice versa.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Panofsky was born in 30 March 1892 at Hanover. His parents, Arnold and Caecilie (Solling) Panofsky were a rentier mining family who lived in Upper Silesia. Panofsky&#x27;s background as cultured Jewish family played a significant role in shaping his career as an art historian. He was immersed in an environment that valued education and cultural refinement from a young age and exposed to classical music and literature such as Divine Comedy, Shakespeare’s sonnets and the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. He did not observe Jewish religious customs as an adult, but he remained proud of his heritage such as sharing story about his grandfather as a renowned Talmud scholar.

He received his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1910 at the Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium. These years were particularly influential to him as he believed the humanistic education he received there was fundamental to his scholarly achievements. He start as law student in Berlin University. During his first semester, he attended lecture by Wilhelm Voge about painting by Albrecht Dürer and became his first realization of his interest into art history. This lecture was known by invitation from Kurt Badt.

During his study, he attended various course such as course from Heinrich Wölfflin, Edmund Hildebrandt, Karl Voll, Karl Frey, Werner Weisbach and Adolph Goldschmidt. When he was 19, he joined a competition and won an award from it. The competition was held by the Grimm Foundation. The subject had been set by Wölfflin and Goldschmidt who assessed the work submitted. The title is &quot;Dürers Kunsttheorie vornehmlich in ihrem Verhältnis zur Kunsttheorie der Italiener.&quot; A part of the paper was submitted as dissertation for him to graduate doctoral in University of Freiburg. The dissertation was published as book in 1915 as &quot;Die theoretische Kunstlehre Albrecht Dürers.&quot; Both of the book was published by Georg Reimer thats part of De gruyter. Because of a riding accident, Panofsky was exempted from military service during World War I. In the spring of 1917, he was considered fit for duty on the home front and was assigned a governmental position in Kassel, and later in Berlin, where he was responsible for distributing coal to the civilian. Demobilization in January 1919 finally released him from military service.

In December 1918, while working in Berlin, Panofsky applied for habilitation at the University of Heidelberg, proposing to submit either his 1915 expanded &quot;Dürers Kunsttheorie vornehmlich in ihrem Verhältnis zur Kunsttheorie der Italiener&quot; or &quot;Der Westbau des Doms zu Minden&quot;. He withdrew the application in March 1919 due to unexplained circumstances. By August 1919, he shifted focus to the University of Tübingen but never finalized the thesis. Following Gustav Pauli&#x27;s invitation on December 1919 to teach art history at the University of Hamburg, Panofsky agreed on the condition of simultaneously pursuing habilitation. By March 11, 1920, he formally submitted the completed first section of his study on Michelangelo’s stylistic development to the university’s Faculty of Philosophy and later, he will complete the second part at the end of the year. Pauli, reviewing the thesis by March 20, privately advised Panofsky to secure housing in Hamburg, anticipating a favorable outcome. Despite Panofsky’s concerns over a three-month administrative silence, the evaluation process advanced: Pauli submitted his endorsement to the habilitation committee on May 10, 1920, and by June 3, committee members Max Lenz, Ernst Cassirer and Otto Lauffer had unanimously approved the application. The Faculty of Philosophy ratified the decision on June 19, scheduling Panofsky’s &quot;Probevorlesung&quot; (trial lecture) for July 3, 1920. Titled &quot;Die Entwicklung der Proportionslehre als Abbild der Stilentwicklung&quot;, the lecture successfully concluded his habilitation, granting him the &quot;venia legendi&quot; and securing his position at Hamburg.During this period, one of his early work was &quot;Idea: Ein Beitrag zur Begriffsgeschichte der älteren Kunstheorie&quot; (1924; translated into English as &quot;Idea: A Concept in Art Theory&quot;), based on the ideas of Ernst Cassirer.

However, shortly after his successful habilitation in July 1920, the manuscript vanished under unclear circumstances. Though on July 3, 1920, based on letter to Dora Panofsky, his wife at that time revealed plans to revise the text suggesting the work was still in his possession. Yet, by 1964, when Egon Verheyen inquired about the thesis after encountering its citation in Gert van der Osten’s article, Panofsky confirmed its loss, stating, “The original manuscript is lost”. There&#x27;s an assumption that the manuscript was lost after he moved out from Germany in 1943/44. Gerda Panofsky was unable to locate it cause there is possibility that Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich, who had studied under Panofsky, was in the possession of this manuscript from 1946 to 1970 and bring it to Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte, in whose basement the manuscript was found. In the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;, Willibald Sauerländer shed some light on the question of whether Heydenreich shared his recovery of the manuscript or not: &quot;Panofsky has historically distanced himself from his early writings on Michelangelo, as he tired of the subject, and,&quot; according to Sauerländer &quot;developed a professional conflict with Austro-Hungarian art historian Johannes Wilde, who accused Panofsky of not crediting him with ideas gleaned from a conversation they had about Michelangelo drawings. Perhaps Panofsky didn&#x27;t care about the whereabouts of his lost work and Heydenreich was not malicious in keeping it a secret ... but questions still remain.&quot; Then, the original 1920 manuscript of Panofsky&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, his second dissertation, which is titled &quot;Die Gestaltungsprinzipien Michelangelos, besonders in ihrem Verhältnis zu denen Raffaels&quot; (&quot;The Composition Principles of Michelangelo, particularly in their relation to those of Raphael&quot;), was found in August 2012 by art historian Stephan Klingen. The manuscript is published as book on 2014 with Gerda as the editor.

===American years (from 1931)===
Panofsky expressed interest in visiting America as early as 1929 on his correspondence with Fritz Saxl, and in 1930, he was invited by New York University to serve as a Visiting Professor by recommendation from Goldschmidt . At that time, NYU&#x27;s College of Fine Arts, which would later become the Institute of Fine Arts, was in the process of establishing America&#x27;s first graduate department for art-historical research. By his participation, he help Richard Offner and Walter William Spencer Cook to shape the department. Then, Panofsky was scheduled to teach during the Fall term of 1931-32, offering graduate-level courses along with a series of public lectures, all delivered in English.

Although initially allowed to spend alternate terms in Hamburg and New York City, after the Nazis came to power in Germany his appointment in Hamburg was terminated because he was Jewish, and he remained permanently in the United States with his wife, Dora. He and his wife became part of the Kahler-Kreis. By 1934 he was teaching concurrently at New York University and Princeton University, and in 1935 he was invited to join the faculty of the new Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained for the rest of his career.

Panofsky was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the British Academy and a number of other national academies. In 1954 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1962 he received the Haskins Medal of The Medieval Academy of America. In 1947–1948 Panofsky was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at Harvard University; the lectures later became &quot;Early Netherlandish Painting&quot;.

He became particularly well known for his studies of symbols and iconography in art. First in a 1934 article, then in his &quot;Early Netherlandish Painting&quot; (1953), Panofsky was the first to interpret Jan van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;Arnolfini Portrait&quot; (1934) as not only a depiction of a wedding ceremony, but also a visual contract testifying to the act of marriage. Panofsky identifies a plethora of hidden symbols that all point to the sacrament of marriage. In recent years, this conclusion has been challenged, but Panofsky&#x27;s work with what he called &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;disguised&quot; symbolism is still very much influential in the study and understanding of Northern Renaissance art. Similarly, in his monograph on Dürer, Panofsky gives lengthy &quot;symbolic&quot; analyses of the prints &quot;Knight, Death, and the Devil&quot; and &quot;Melencolia I&quot;, the former based on Erasmus&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of a Christian Knight&quot;.

Panofsky was known to be a friend with physicists Wolfgang Pauli and Albert Einstein. His younger son, Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, became a renowned physicist who specialized in particle accelerators. His elder son, Hans A. Panofsky, was &quot;an atmospheric scientist who taught at Pennsylvania State University for 30 years and who was credited with several advances in the study of meteorology&quot;. As Wolfgang Panofsky related, his father used to call his sons &quot;meine beiden Klempner&quot; (&quot;my two plumbers&quot;). William S. Heckscher was a student, fellow emigre, and close friend. In 1973 he was succeeded at Princeton by Irving Lavin.
Erwin Panofsky has been recognized as both a &quot;highly distinguished&quot; professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, and in Jeffrey Chipps&#x27; biography of the subject as &quot;the most influential art historian of the twentieth century&quot;. In 1999, the new &quot;Panofsky Lane&quot;, in that Institute&#x27;s faculty housing complex, was named in his honor.

== Iconology ==

Panofsky was the most eminent representative of iconology, a method of studying the history of art created by Aby Warburg and his disciples, especially Fritz Saxl, at the Warburg Institute in Hamburg. A personal and professional friendship linked him to Fritz Saxl in collaboration with whom he produced a large part of his work. He gave a short and precise description of his method in his article &quot;Iconography and Iconology&quot;, published in 1939.

===Three strata of subject matter or meaning===

In &quot;Studies in Iconology&quot; Panofsky details his idea of three levels of art-historical understanding:

*Primary or natural subject matter: The most basic level of understanding, this stratum consists of perception of the work&#x27;s pure form. Take, for example, a painting of the Last Supper. If we stopped at this first stratum, such a picture could only be perceived as a painting of 13 men seated at a table. This first level is the most basic understanding of a work, devoid of any added cultural knowledge.
*Secondary or conventional subject matter (iconography): This stratum goes a step further and brings to the comparison of cultural and iconographic knowledge. For example, a Western viewer would understand that the painting of 13 men around a table would represent the Last Supper. Similarly, a representation of a haloed man with a lion could be interpreted as a depiction of St. Mark.
*Tertiary or intrinsic meaning or content (iconology): This level takes into account personal, technical, and cultural history into the understanding of a work. It looks at art not as an isolated incident, but as the product of an historical environment. Working in this stratum, the art historian can ask questions like &quot;why did the artist choose to represent &quot;The Last Supper&quot; in this way?&quot; or &quot;Why was St. Mark such an important saint to the patron of this work?&quot; Essentially, this last stratum is a synthesis; it is the art historian asking &quot;what does it all mean?&quot;

For Panofsky, it was important to consider all three strata as one examines Renaissance art. Irving Lavin says &quot;it was this insistence on, and search for, meaning — especially in places where no one suspected there was any — that led Panofsky to understand art, as no previous historian had, as an intellectual endeavor on a par with the traditional liberal arts.&quot;

The method of iconology, which had developed following Erwin Panofsky, has been critically discussed since the mid-1950s, in part also strongly (Otto Pächt, Svetlana Alpers). However, among the critics, no one has found a model of interpretation that could completely replace that of Panofsky.

As regards the interpretation of Christian art, that Panofsky researched throughout his life, the iconographic interest in texts as possible sources remains important, because the meaning of Christian images and architecture is closely linked to the content of biblical, liturgical and theological texts, which were usually considered authoritative by most patrons, artists and viewers.

=== Style and the Film Medium ===
In his 1936 essay &quot;Style and Medium in the Motion Pictures (text online), Panofsky seeks to describe the visual symptoms endemic&quot; to the medium of film.

==Legacy==
In 2016, the Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte (Central Institute for Art History) in Munich founded the Panofsky-Professur (Panofsky Professorship). The first Panofsky Professors have been Victor Stoichita (2016), Gauvin Alexander Bailey (2017), Caroline van Eck (2018), and Olivier Bonfait (2019). His work has greatly influenced the theory of taste developed by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, in books such as &quot;The Rules of Art&quot; and &quot;Distinction&quot;. In particular, Bourdieu first adapted his notion of habitus from Panofsky&#x27;s &quot;Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism&quot;, having earlier translated the work into French.

<text>Paul Whitehead Sturrock (born 10 October 1956) is a Scottish former football coach and former player.

As a player, Sturrock spent his entire senior career with Dundee United, making more than five hundred appearances between 1974 and 1989. He won the Scottish Football League title with United in 1982–83 and the Scottish League Cup twice, in 1979 and 1980. He was named the SFWA Footballer of the Year in 1982. At international level, Sturrock played twenty times for Scotland and appeared at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups.
Sturrock&#x27;s managerial career began with St Johnstone in 1993, where he went on to win the Scottish First Division title in 1996–97 before returning to Dundee United as manager. Since 2000, Sturrock has worked as a manager in English football, initially with Plymouth Argyle where he helped the club to win two promotions before moving on to a brief spell with Southampton. He has subsequently also managed Sheffield Wednesday, Swindon Town and Southend United as well as returning to Plymouth for a second spell. He became Yeovil Town manager in April 2015, but left the club eight months later. According to an analysis by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; he was among the country&#x27;s best ever managers, even though he has mostly managed clubs at Championship level and below.

He is known by fans as &quot;Luggy&quot; (from the Scots language word &quot;lugs&quot;, Eng: &quot;ears&quot;). Sturrock announced in July 2008 that he was suffering from a mild form of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. His son, Blair, was also a professional footballer.

== Early life ==
Sturrock was born in Ellon, Aberdeenshire, and grew up in Pitlochry, Perthshire, where he was educated at the local primary and secondary schools and played for amateur side Grandtully Vale. In 1972, he joined Vale of Atholl of the Perthshire Amateur First Division (where he returned as coach in his latter days with Dundee United), and in the 1972–73 season he scored approximately 100 goals. He then moved on to Bankfoot Athletic, and in the 1973–74 season he scored 53 goals as they finished 2nd in the Scottish Junior FA First Division. He had trials with Morton and St Johnstone, but was signed for Dundee United by then manager Jim McLean on 1 July 1974.

== Club career==
Sturrock made his debut in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup match v Juil Petrosani of Romania on 18 September 1974 and his league debut on 28 December 1974 as a substitute against Motherwell.

In his first season at Tannadice he made nine League appearances and came on from the substitutes&#x27; bench for three more and in the process he scored six goals. His first goal for Dundee United was one of two he scored in a 2–2 draw with Rangers at Tannadice on 5 April 1975. Dundee United finished fourth in the League that year. In the following season, he made 18 League appearances, eight as sub, and scored three times. He was also played as a substitute in two of the three Scottish Cup ties and was on from the start in five out of six League Cup games and scored once. He also started in three of the four UEFA Cup games netting one in that competition, too.

1976–77 not only saw Dundee United consolidate their Premier League position but throughout the campaign Sturrock was an ever-present, playing in all 36 League games and scoring 15 times. Adding that total to one each in the Scottish Cup and League Cup he was top scorer at the Club that year. He played in United&#x27;s only Scottish Cup tie, a 4–1 defeat at St Mirren. He also appeared four times plus once as sub out of the six League Cup ties. In a short-lived Anglo Scottish Cup campaign he was brought on as sub in one leg of the tie against Aberdeen.

In 1982–83, Dundee United won the Scottish League Championship, losing only four League games during the season. Sturrock contributed to this success with eight goals in his 28 appearances. He also set up Ralph Milne for his fourth-minute opener against Dundee in the final League game. The Scottish Cup that year had been yet another early exit at the hands of St Mirren. Sturrock scored seven in the nine games he turned out in on the way to a League Cup quarter-final exit. He also played in seven of the eight games and scored once in a UEFA Cup run that ended with an exit in Prague.

His playing career came to an end in 1989, with his final goal for United occurring on 8 April 1989 in a 2-1 victory against local rivals Dundee. Over the course of his playing career from 1974 to 1989, he made 385 league appearances for the club and scored 109 goals. When considering all competitions, he amassed a total of 171 goals in 576 games, which places him as the second-highest goal scorer in Dundee United&#x27;s history. Following his playing career, Sturrock remained at Tannadice for the next five years in a coaching role. After twenty years of continuous service, he eventually departed the club in 1993.

In addition, Sturrock finished runner-up to Alan Rough for the Scottish Writers&#x27; award in 1981.

== International career ==
Sturrock made his first appearance for the Scotland under-21 team on 12 October 1976, in a goalless draw with Czechoslovakia. Four months later, he scored in a 3–2 win against Wales under-21s on 9 February 1977.

Sturrock made his full international debut for Scotland against Wales on 16 May 1981, and on 8 November 1981, he scored his first goal for Scotland in the 2–1 World Cup qualifier defeat against Portugal in Lisbon. Sturrock won 20 caps for his country, scoring three goals. He was a non-playing member of the Scotland squad for the 1982 World Cup finals in Spain and appeared twice in Mexico in 1986.

== Managerial career ==
In a 2012 study by Stefan Szymanski, economics professor at the University of Michigan, Sturrock was rated as one of the best managers in English football.

=== St Johnstone ===
In 1993, Sturrock became the manager of Premier Division team St Johnstone. The team were relegated to the First Division at the end of the 1993–94 season. It took a while for Sturrock to improve the club&#x27;s fortunes, as they lost 4–0 to Stenhousemuir in the 1994–95 Scottish Cup, and he then collapsed in the dugout at Tannadice while managing St Johnstone against Dundee United during the 1995–96 season. While he was recovering in hospital from the collapse, Sturrock was called by his former international manager Alex Ferguson. Ferguson warned Sturrock that he was &quot;trying to make bad players into good players&quot; and to just get rid of the &quot;bad pros&quot; in his squad. Sturrock guided Saints to promotion back to the Premier Division in 1996–97, winning the First Division by 20 points. In their first season back in the Premier Division, St Johnstone finished in fifth place in 1997–98.

=== Dundee United ===
In September 1998 Sturrock was appointed manager at Dundee United. He made a bright start to his time as manager at Tannadice, where he was feted by the fans for his excellent spell as a player. His United team failed to recover from the sale of top scorer Billy Dodds in December 1999, when they were lying third in the table. The team scored few goals following Dodds&#x27;s departure, and Sturrock resigned after two games of the 2000–01 season.

=== Plymouth Argyle ===
In October 2000 Sturrock joined Plymouth Argyle, a club which had reached the lowest ebb in its history, struggling in the English Football League Third Division. A shake-up at boardroom level took place, Sturrock began to build his own squad. The following season, he guided them to the Third Division title breaking numerous records in the process, including a club and league points total of 102. In October 2003, Sturrock had successfully taken Argyle back to the top of the Football League Second Division and left when Plymouth had just 12 games to play in what would prove to be another season when they would finish as divisional champions and return to the Football League Championship, formerly known as the First Division. As a result of his success at Home Park he was named as the manager of Argyle&#x27;s Team of the Century in a BBC Devon poll.

=== Southampton ===
Sturrock was named as the successor to Gordon Strachan as manager of Southampton on 4 March 2004. On 23 August 2004 it was announced that Sturrock was leaving the club &#x27;by mutual consent&#x27;, after a disappointing run of form and rumours of player unrest and boardroom dissatisfaction with his management.

=== Sheffield Wednesday ===
Sturrock was then appointed by League One club Sheffield Wednesday languishing in 14th place on 23 September 2004, and he guided the club to the League One play-offs. After beating Brentford in the semi-final with an aggregate score of 3–1, Sturrock took Wednesday to the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium and beat Hartlepool United 4–2 after extra-time, winning promotion to the Championship. Despite numerous injuries to key players he helped Wednesday to finish 10 points clear of relegation in their first season back in The Championship.

A slow start to the 2006–07 season sparked rumours that Wednesday were about to sack Sturrock, but this speculation looked to be false when he agreed a new four-year contract on 14 September. But he was sacked on the evening of 19 October, just five weeks and three games after agreeing this new deal. The new contract was agreed while the club were at the bottom of the League, while he was sacked when they were fourth from bottom.

=== Swindon Town ===
In late October 2006, Swindon Town allowed their management team of Dennis Wise and Gustavo Poyet to join Leeds United. Swindon pounced at the opportunity to acquire the services of Sturrock and on 7 November 2006 Sturrock was confirmed as manager with Kevin Summerfield and John Blackley following him from Wednesday. Sturrock&#x27;s first season in charge at Swindon was a success, achieving promotion from League Two to League One.

Swindon made a decent start to the 2007–08 season, maintaining their position in the top half of the league table after the first 8 games.

=== Return to Plymouth ===
On 27 November 2007, Sturrock resigned his post as Swindon Town manager after just over a year with the club to rejoin previous club Plymouth Argyle. Sturrock also brought back to the club assistants Kevin Summerfield and John Blackley, who were previously with him during his first successful spell as manager. Sturrock then proceeded to take the club to its highest league position in 20 years: tenth in the Championship. However, the team subsequently struggled and finished five points and one place outside the Championship relegation zone in the 2008–09 season. On 10 December 2009, Sturrock was removed as Plymouth Argyle manager and put into a business support role by chairman Sir Roy Gardner. On 22 April 2010, the Plymouth board confirmed that Sturrock had left his role within the club to pursue other managerial opportunities. Following Sturrock&#x27;s departure, it emerged that the board had mis-managed the finances of the club and Argyle entered administration.

=== Southend United ===
On 5 July 2010, Sturrock was confirmed as manager of League Two Southend United. Former Salisbury City manager Tommy Widdrington was named as Sturrock&#x27;s assistant manager while one of Sturrock&#x27;s former players at Plymouth Argyle and Sheffield Wednesday, who served as captain at the latter, Graham Coughlan was soon appointed as a player-coach.

Sturrock faced the tough task of rebuilding the Southend side with only five first team players available for selection at one stage of pre-season, with only Anthony Grant, Matt Paterson and Scott Spencer surviving. He soon appointed new signing Craig Easton, who he had previously managed at Swindon Town, as captain while another player from one of Sturrock&#x27;s old clubs, Chris Barker, was later appointed as vice-captain, having initially been signed on loan, and then permanently on deadline day. It was not an easy task for Sturrock as his assistant, Tommy Widdrington left for &quot;footballing reasons&quot; on Wednesday 15 December 2010. After a mid table finish in his first season, he enjoyed more success during the 2011–12 season where Southend led League Two for most of the campaign. Sturrock was named Manager of the Month for September 2011 by the Football League.

Sturrock was sacked as manager of Southend United on 24 March 2013 although it was agreed that he could lead out the players in the final of the Football League Trophy to be held at Wembley on 7 April. Sturrock declined the offer.

=== Yeovil Town ===
After a brief spell as an advisor to Conference Premier side Torquay United, he departed just four days after taking the job, after being appointed manager of Football League One side Yeovil Town on 9 April 2015, with the club all but relegated.

Following a poor start to the season, Yeovil announced on 1 December 2015 that they had parted company with Sturrock.

=== Post-retirement ===
Following his retirement from professional management, Sturrock returned to live in the South West of England. He remained involved in local football, being given an advisory role at non-League club Plymouth Parkway. He also writes a regular column for local newspaper, the &quot;Plymouth Evening Herald&quot;.

On 8 March 2018, Sturrock renewed his involvement with Dundee United when he was appointed as the club&#x27;s chief scout in England. Later in March, Sturrock was added to the United coaching staff. He left United during the 2018–19 season.

<text>Ariodante (HWV 33) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel. The anonymous Italian libretto was based on a work by Antonio Salvi, which in turn was adapted from Canti 4, 5 and 6 of Ludovico Ariosto&#x27;s &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;. Each act contains opportunities for dance, originally composed for dancer Marie Sallé and her company.

The opera was first performed in the Covent Garden Theatre, London, on 8 January 1735. &quot;Ariodante&quot; opened Handel&#x27;s first season at Covent Garden and successfully competed against the rival Opera of the Nobility, supported by the Prince of Wales. Handel had the tacit and financial support of the King and Queen and, more vocally, of the Princess Royal. The opera received 11 performances during its premiere season at Covent Garden.

Like Handel&#x27;s other works in the &quot;opera seria&quot; genre, &quot;Ariodante&quot;, despite its initial success, fell into oblivion for nearly two hundred years. An edition of the score was published in the early 1960s, from the Hallische Händel-Ausgabe. In the 1970s, the work began to be revived, and has come to be considered one of Handel&#x27;s finest operas. On 29 March 1971, the Handel Society of New York performed the American premiere of the work in a concert version with mezzo-soprano Sophia Steffan in the title role and Judith Raskin as Ginevra.

Charles Cudworth has discussed the influence of French dance music in the opera. Winton Dean has noted that Act 2 of the opera, in its original version, is the only act in a Handel opera which ends with accompanied recitative.

==Background==

The German-born Handel had brought Italian opera to London stages for the first time in 1711 with his opera &quot;Rinaldo&quot;. An enormous success, &quot;Rinaldo&quot; created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. Handel had presented new operas in London for years with great success. One of the major attractions in Handel&#x27;s operas was the star castrato Senesino whose relationship with the composer was often stormy and who eventually left Handel&#x27;s company to appear with the rival Opera of the Nobility, set up in 1733. Handel moved to another theatre, Covent Garden, and engaged different singers. The new theatre at Covent Garden, run by impresario John Rich, added the attraction of a troupe of dancers led by the celebrated Marie Sallé, so Handel&#x27;s two new operas for 1735, &quot;Ariodante&quot; and
&quot;Alcina&quot; both include dance sequences, for the first time in Handel opera for London. The singers for whom Handel wrote &quot;Ariodante&quot; included a young soprano, Cecilia Young, whom he had not worked with before, considered by contemporary musicologist Charles Burney to be the finest English soprano of the day, and the virtuoso castrato Carestini, whose astonishing technique and huge vocal range Handel made full use of, especially in the &quot;scena&quot; &quot;E vivo ancora? E senza il ferro? oh Dei! ... Scherza infida in grembo al drudo&quot; and in the jubilant and bravura &quot;Dopo notte, atra e funesta&quot;.

==Synopsis==

Medieval Scotland. Ginevra, daughter of the King, is in love with and betrothed to Prince Ariodante. She rejects the amorous advances of the Duke of Albany, Polinesso, who then cruelly tricks Ariodante and Ginevra&#x27;s father into believing that Ginevra has been unfaithful. Ariodante attempts suicide and Ginevra is condemned, but after a challenge to a duel by Lurcanio, Ariodante&#x27;s brother, the dying Polinesso admits his plot and the lovers are reunited.

===Act 1===

&quot;The royal cabinet, in the palace&quot;

Princess Ginevra, in front of her mirror, is adorning herself to make herself beautiful for her beloved. (Aria:&quot;Vezze, lusinghe&quot;). Polinesso, Duke of Albany, bursts into the room and, thinking that having the king&#x27;s daughter as his sweetheart would advance his prospects, declares his love for her. Ginevra indignantly rejects him (Aria:&quot;Orrida a gl&#x27;occhi miei&quot;) and leaves. Dalinda, who is secretly in love with Polinesso, advises him that his rival is Prince Ariodante but also advises him that all he has to do is open his eyes to see someone else who loves him (Aria:&quot;Apri le luci&quot;). Left alone, Polinesso can see that Dalinda is in love with him and plans to use her to thwart his rival and win Ginevra for himself (Aria: &quot;Coperta la frode&quot;).

&quot;The royal gardens&quot;

Ariodante sings of how all nature speaks to him of love (Aria:&quot;Quì d&#x27;amor&quot;). Ginevra joins him and they pledge their love (Duet: &quot;Prendi, prendi da questa mano&quot;). The King joins the lovers, gives them his blessing, and orders his courtier Odoardo to make the preparations for the wedding (Aria: &quot;Voli colla sua tromba&quot;). Alone, Ariodante swears to be faithful to Ginevra (Aria:&quot;Con l&#x27;ali di costanza&quot;). Polinesso hatches his plot – he tells Dalinda that if she will dress as Ginevra that evening and invite him into her apartments, he will be hers (Aria:&quot;Spero per voi&quot;). Lurcanio, Ariodante&#x27;s brother, then appears to Dalinda and declares his love for her (Aria:&quot;Del mio sol vezzosi rai&quot;) but she has totally lost her heart to Polinesso (Aria:&quot;Il primo ardor&quot;).

&quot;A delightful valley&quot;

Ariodante and Ginevra enjoy the beauties of nature and each other&#x27;s company (Duet: &quot;Se rinasce nel mio cor&quot;). They are joined by shepherds and shepherdesses (Duet with chorus:&quot;Si godete al vostro amor&quot;) who dance to entertain them (Ballet).

===Act 2===

&quot;By ancient ruins, within sight of Ginevra&#x27;s apartments; moonlight&quot;

Polinesso and Ariodante meet; Polinesso feigns astonishment when Ariodante tells him he is betrothed to Ginevra, insisting that Ginevra loves him. Ariodante refuses to believe it. This is all being observed by Lurcanio, who is hidden. Polinesso tells Ariodante to watch as &quot;Ginevra&quot;, really Dalinda wearing Ginevra&#x27;s clothes, admits Polinesso into her bedroom for the night. Ariodante is in despair and wants to die (Aria:&quot;Tu preparati a morire&quot;) but Lurcanio comes from the shadows and advises Ariodante to live, and seek revenge (Aria:&quot;Tu vivi&quot;). Ariodante sadly bewails his beloved&#x27;s (supposed) infidelity (Aria:&quot;Scherza infida&quot;). As day breaks, Polinesso and Dalinda emerge from the palace. Polinesso promises he will reward her, to her delight (Aria:&quot;Se tanto piace al cor&quot;) and, alone, Polinesso exults in how well his plot is proceeding (Aria:&quot;Se l&#x27;inganno&quot;).

&quot;A gallery in the palace&quot;

As the King is making the final arrangements for his daughter&#x27;s wedding, the courtier Odoardo brings him bad news – Ariodante has been seen committing suicide by leaping into the sea. The King is heartbroken (Aria:&quot;Invida sorte avara&quot;). Ginevra appears, having a premonition of some approaching calamity (Aria:&quot;Mi palpita il core&quot;). When her father gives her the terrible news, she swoons and is carried away. Lurcanio now appears before the King, who attempts to comfort him on the loss of his brother. The furious Lurcanio, however, hands the King a letter telling him he saw Ginevra admit Polinesso into her bedroom for the night, which caused his brother to kill himself, and Lurcanio now is bent on revenge (Aria:&quot;Il tuo sangue&quot;). The King disowns his daughter and condemns her as a harlot. When Ginevra hears this, she collapses into delirium (Aria:&quot;Il mio crudel martoro&quot;) and all Dalinda&#x27;s attempts to console her fail. Ginevra falls into a fitful, disturbed sleep (Ballet of Good and Bad Dreams). She awakes in distress (Recitativo accompagnato:&quot;Che vidi? oh Dei! misera me!&quot;)

===Act 3===

&quot;A wood near the sea&quot;

Ariodante survived, and he now bitterly rebukes the gods for condemning him to live (Arioso:&quot;Numi! lasciarmi vivere&quot;). Hearing cries, Ariodante finds Dalinda, who is being held by thugs hired by Polinesso, with orders to kill her, as she is the only witness to his plot to discredit Ginevra. Ariodante drives Polinesso&#x27;s henchmen away, and Dalinda reveals the truth to him – it was she, disguised as Ginevra, who let Polinesso into her bedroom. Ariodante rails against the treachery that caused him to doubt his beloved (Aria:&quot;Cieca notte&quot;). Alone, Dalinda expresses her remorse (Aria:&quot;Neghittosi or voi che fate?&quot;).

&quot;The royal gardens&quot;

The King announces that he will never see his daughter again unless a champion appears to defend her honour. Polinesso steps forward and offers to challenge Lurcanio to a duel (Aria:&quot;Dover, giustizia, amor&quot;). Ginevra, condemned to death for sexual irregularity, appears before her father begging to be allowed to kiss his hand (Aria:&quot;Io ti bacio&quot;). Her father clasps her to her bosom, saying that a champion has appeared to defend her – Polinesso. She does not like this idea, but he insists (Aria:&quot;Al sen ti stringo e parto&quot;). Ginevra prefers death to the loss of her honour (Aria:&quot;Sì, morrò&quot;). Lurcanio again offers his love to Dalinda, and she indicates that she is now inclined to accept it (Duet:&quot; Dite spera, e son contento&quot;).

&quot;The duelling ground, the King on his throne&quot;

Polinesso and Lurcanio fight, Lurcanio mortally wounds Polinesso who is carried away by Odaordo. A new champion appears with his visor down. He reveals himself as Ariodante, to the astonishment of all, and declares Ginevra innocent. Dalinda admits her part in the plot. Odoardo returns with the news that Polinesso, as he died, also admitted his guilt. The King pardons Dalinda and goes to find his daughter. Ariodante jubilantly hails a new bright day dawning after nights of darkness (Aria:&quot;Dopo notte&quot;).

&quot;The room where Ginevra is imprisoned&quot;

Ginevra looks death in the face (Arioso:&quot;Manca, oh Dei!&quot;). But her father and the others appear and declare her vindicated. She is reunited with her beloved Ariodante (Duet:&quot;Bramo aver mille vite&quot;).

&quot;The great hall of the palace. A large staircase supported by columns; on the upper part of the stairs musicians playing wind instruments. The King, Lords and Ladies descend the staircase. He begins the chorus, as the Lords and Ladies dance.&quot;

&quot;Ogn&#x27;uno acclami bella virtute&quot; (Chorus) ... Ballo (Gavotte—Rondeau—Bourrée) ... &quot;Sa trionfar ognor virtute in ogni cor&quot; (Chorus).

==Musical features==

The music for the leading soprano, Ginevra, is &quot;outstanding&quot;, according to Paul Henry Lang, moving from joy to despair and back again to happiness. Also of note is the &quot;exquisite&quot; duet for her with Ariodante, &quot;Prendi, prendi da questa mano&quot; and the beautiful pastoral music that concludes the first act. Among a series of remarkable arias for the title role, sung in the first performance by the castrato Carestini, are the mournful aria with bassoon obbligato &quot;Scherza infida&quot;, &quot;one of Handel&#x27;s greatest arias&quot; and the joyful &quot;Dopo notte&quot; with astonishing vocal acrobatics and huge range. For Charles Burney, the opera &quot;abounds with beauties and the strokes of a great master.&quot;

==Reception and performance history==

&quot;Ariodante&quot; was given eleven performances in its original run, a mark of success for the time, and was revived by Handel for his 1736 season. It then went unperformed until a revival in Stuttgart in 1926. Two performances in Birmingham, England, in May 1964, with Janet Baker in the title role and Anthony Lewis conducting, brought the opera into the modern repertory, since when it has been performed on many of the world&#x27;s stages.

Among other performances, a four-way co-production between the Festival d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence, the Canadian Opera Company, Dutch National Opera in Amsterdam, and Lyric Opera of Chicago premiered at Aix in 2014. This updated the setting to the 1960s and altered the ending so that Ginevra departs the celebration, heartbroken.

The English Concert gave semi-staged performances in 2017 in the U.S. and Europe, including at Carnegie Hall, where the event was filmed, and at the Barbican Centre. The Salzburg Whitsun Festival presented a new production by Christof Loy on 2 June 2017 featuring Cecilia Bartoli as Ariodante, Kathryn Lewek as Ginevra, Sandrine Piau as Dalinda, Christophe Dumaux as Polinesso, Rolando Villazón as Lurcanio and Nathan Berg as the King.

<text>Hanslope is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority area of the City of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England. The village is about west northwest of Newport Pagnell, about north of Stony Stratford and north of Central Milton Keynes. The northern parish boundary is part of the county boundary with Northamptonshire.

The West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Glasgow passes through the western part of the parish, just over west of the village.

==Toponymy==
The name of the village has evolved over the centuries. In the 11th century, it was variously spelt &quot;Hammescle&quot;, &quot;Hanslepe&quot; or &quot;Anslepe&quot;. In the 13th century, it was &quot;Hameslepe&quot; or &quot; Hamslape&quot;, and the latter form continued in use into the 14th century. It was &quot;Hanslopp&quot; in the 15th century and &quot;Hanslap&quot; or &quot;Anslope&quot; in the 16th century. &quot;Anslap&quot;, &quot;Anslapp&quot; and &quot;Hanslapp&quot; were used early in the 18th century and &quot;Hanslape&quot; was used in the 19th century. The toponym&#x27;s etymology is from the Old English for a slippery or muddy place belonging to &quot;Haema&quot;, or possibly &quot;hemmed-in land at the slope&quot;.

==History==
Hanslope was included in the grant of land to the Norman Maudit (or Mauduit) family by William the Conqueror following the Norman Conquest and the family&#x27;s seat was Hanslope Castle, which later became Castlethorpe. In the Domesday Book of 1086, the manor was assessed 10 hides and held by Winemar. On 28 November 1215, the castle was captured after William Maudit had started a rebellion against King John and was defeated in battle by the king&#x27;s men, who were led by Falkes de Bréauté. The castle building has been lost but the grassy mounds of the motte and bailey earthworks survive. After King John&#x27;s death, Maudit reclaimed his seat and founded a great park in the parish, remnants of which still survive in Hanslope. Isabel Mauduit was the mother of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick (1237–98). From 1293 the Earl was chartered to have a weekly market in Hanslope on Thursdays and a three-day annual market on the eve, day and morrow of the feast of St. James the Great (24, 25 and 26 July).

In the Middle Ages the parish was part of Salcey Forest and Hanslope Park was originally a medieval deer park. Much later, the park was landscaped by Humphry Repton before 1794.

Hanslope was a centre of Buckinghamshire lacemaking in the 19th century. Early in the 19th century, Hanslope lace was noted as being particularly fine, and in 1862 about 500 women and children in the parish were employed making pillow lace.

===Listed buildings and structures===
The parish has one scheduled monument, one grade I listed building, and 33 grade II listed buildings.

==Governance==

Hanslope has been part of the Borough (now City) of Milton Keynes since 1973, which has been a unitary authority since 1997. This gives Milton Keynes City Council the responsibility for the provision of most local government services. Voters registered in Hanslope are represented on MK City Council, which has (since 2014) been divided into 19 wards each carrying 3 councillors with Hanslope being part of the Newport Pagnell North and Hanslope ward. Between 2002 and 2021, the ward of Newport Pagnell North and Hanslope had a single representative that was voted in every four years and always returned a Conservative councillor.

At the parish level, Hanslope has a parish council based at the village&#x27;s Recreation Ground on Castlethorpe Road.

For the purposes of representation in the House of Commons, Hanslope was part of the Milton Keynes North East constituency from 1992 until its abolition in 2010 and Hanslope has since sat within the Milton Keynes North constituency.

==Geology==
Hanslope is conveniently close to quarries for Great Oolite limestone, which has been used in the parish&#x27;s traditional vernacular architecture.

==Landmarks==

===Parish church===

The Church of England parish church of St. James the Great was originally a Norman building, established as a dependent chapelry of Castlethorpe. Later St. James the Great became the parish&#x27;s principal church, with Castlethorpe as its dependent chapel.

The Perpendicular Gothic church spire is a prominent feature of the village and surrounding landscape. It was originally built early in the 15th century and was high. In 1804 it collapsed after being struck by lightning and afterwards it was rebuilt to the slightly lesser height of . However, it is still the tallest in Buckinghamshire. The church has an open day each summer, when the tower is open to the public.

The spire can be seen for long distances across the low-lying countryside. In 1722, when the spire was 200 feet high, the antiquarian Thomas Hearne, who was a friend of John Knibb, wrote that Knibb &quot;...told me he hath seen Anslapp spire in Bucks from Brill...&quot;. This is a distance of just over .

William Newcome was ordained as a Church of England priest and became curate at Hanslope in Buckinghamshire until 1846, when he was appointed rector of Boothby Pagnell in Lincolnshire.

One notable incumbent was James Mayne MA who was rector from 1841 to 1851, previously curate of St Matthew&#x27;s, Bethnal Green. In series 5 of the &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; television programme, Patsy Kensit discovered that he was one of her ancestors and was shown his grave during a visit to the church.

The church is a Grade I listed building, the highest level of designation.

===Hanslope Park===

About half a mile south-east of the village is Hanslope Park. Once the manorial estate of the village, it is now owned by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and is home to HM Government Communications Centre.

==Transport==

===Road===
Hanslope is served by the 33 bus which has Northampton and Central Milton Keynes as opposite ends of its routes and also passes through Wootton, Quinton, Roade, Ashton, Hartwell, Castlethorpe, Haversham, Wolverton and Bradwell, running approximately hourly from Monday to Saturday and does not run on Sundays or public holidays.

===Rail===
Hanslope does not have its own railway station. Until 1964, it was served by Castlethorpe railway station, about away. At present, the nearest stations are and .

====Hanslope Junction====

The four-track West Coast Main Line passes about south-west of the village, northwest-/southeast-bound. To the north of Hanslope, just north of the former Roade railway station, the line divides. Two tracks go directly to and the other two form the Northampton Loop Line to . Most fast [intercity] trains are on the Rugby route and can continue without changing tracks; the same is true of slower commuter trains taking the Northampton route.

Hanslope Junction (at , roughly midway between Roade and Castlethorpe) is the point where trains may cross between the mainline and the loop tracks, under signal control. In the chainage notation traditionally used on the railway, its location on the line is from .

==Notable people==

In 1316, the Crown official and judge Adam de Harvington was given the living of Hanslope. He became England&#x27;s Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1327.
In 1697 the distinguished clockmaker Joseph Knibb (1640–1711) retired from London to Hanslope, acquiring Green End Farm with a total of about of land. Despite his retirement, he continued at Hanslope to make clocks, some of which survive. His will, proved in 1712 left his Hanslope property to his younger brother John Knibb (1650–1722), who was a notable clockmaker in Oxford. However, John kept his business in Oxford and only one clock marked &quot;John Knibb Hanslapp&quot; is known. Green End Farmhouse predated the Knibbs&#x27; ownership of the farm and was a scheduled monument under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Despite this protection its last owner demolished the historic house in 1954.

In 1714, Gervase Pierrepont, 1st Baron Pierrepont was made Baron Pierrepont of Hanslope in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with this creation giving him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. On his death on 22 May 1715, the barony became extinct, but the title Baron Pierrepont has been used twice since in other parts of the country.

Walter Drawbridge Crick was born in Hanslope on 15 December 1857. He was an English businessman (shoemaker), amateur geologist and palaeontologist who published with Charles Darwin. He was the grandfather of Francis Crick, the molecular geneticist.

<text>Probability is a measure of the likeliness that an event will occur. Probability is used to quantify an attitude of mind towards some proposition whose truth is not certain. The proposition of interest is usually of the form &quot;A specific event will occur.&quot; The attitude of mind is of the form &quot;How certain is it that the event will occur?&quot; The certainty that is adopted can be described in terms of a numerical measure, and this number, between 0 and 1 (where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty) is called the probability. Probability theory is used extensively in statistics, mathematics, science and philosophy to draw conclusions about the likelihood of potential events and the underlying mechanics of complex systems.

<text>Macadam is a type of road construction pioneered by Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam , in which crushed stone is placed in shallow, convex layers and compacted thoroughly. A binding layer of stone dust (crushed stone from the original material) may form; it may also, after rolling, be covered with a cement or bituminous binder to keep dust and stones together. The method simplified what had been considered state-of-the-art at that point.

== Predecessors ==
===Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet===
Pierre-Marie-Jérôme Trésaguet is sometimes considered the first person to bring post-Roman science to road building. A Frenchman from an engineering family, he worked paving roads in Paris from 1757 to 1764. As chief engineer of road construction of Limoges, he had opportunity to develop a better and cheaper method of road construction. In 1775, Tresaguet became engineer-general and presented his answer for road improvement in France, which soon became standard practice there.

Trésaguet had recommended a roadway consisting of three layers of stones laid on a crowned subgrade with side ditches for drainage. The first two layers consisted of angular hand-broken aggregate, maximum size , to a depth of about . The third layer was about thick with a maximum aggregate size of . This top-level surface permitted a smoother shape and protected the larger stones in the road structure from iron wheels and horse hooves. To keep the running surface level with the countryside, this road was put in a trench, which created drainage problems. These problems were addressed by changes that included digging deep side ditches, making the surface as solid as possible, and constructing the road with a difference in elevation (height) between the two edges, that difference being referred to interchangeably as the road&#x27;s camber or cross slope.

===Thomas Telford===

Thomas Telford, born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a surveyor and engineer who applied Tresaguet&#x27;s road building theories. In 1801 Telford worked for the Commission of Highland Roads and Bridges. He became director of the Holyhead Road Commission between 1815 and 1830. Telford extended Tresaguet&#x27;s theories but emphasized high-quality stone. He recognized that some of the road problems of the French could be avoided by using cubical stone blocks.

Telford used roughly partially shaped paving stones (pitchers), with a slight flat face on the bottom surface. He turned the other faces more vertically than Tresaguet&#x27;s method. The longest edge was arranged crossways to the traffic direction, and the joints were broken in the method of conventional brickwork but with the smallest faces of the pitcher forming the upper and lower surfaces.

Broken stone was wedged into the spaces between the tapered perpendicular faces to provide the layer with good lateral control. Telford kept the natural formation level and used masons to camber the upper surface of the blocks. He placed a layer of stone no bigger than on top of the rock foundation. To finish the road surface he covered the stones with a mixture of gravel and broken stone. This structure came to be known as &quot;Telford pitching.&quot; Telford&#x27;s road depended on a resistant structure to prevent water from collecting and corroding the strength of the pavement. Telford raised the pavement structure above ground level whenever possible.

Where the structure could not be raised, Telford drained the area surrounding the roadside. Previous road builders in Britain ignored drainage problems, and Telford&#x27;s rediscovery of drainage principles was a major contribution to road construction. Notably, around the same time, John Metcalf strongly advocated that drainage was in fact an important factor in road construction and astonished colleagues by building dry roads even through marshland. He accomplished this by incorporating a layer of brushwood and heather.

==Advent of macadam==

===John McAdam===
John Loudon McAdam was born in Ayr, Scotland, in 1756. In 1787, he became a trustee of the Ayrshire Turnpike in the Scottish Lowlands and during the next seven years his hobby became an obsession. He moved to Bristol, England, in 1802 and became a Commissioner for Paving in 1806. On 15 January 1816, he was elected surveyor general of roads for the Bristol turnpike trust and was responsible for 149 miles of road. He then put his ideas about road construction into practice, the first &#x27;macadamised&#x27; stretch of road being Marsh Road at Ashton Gate, Bristol. He also began to actively propagate his ideas in two booklets called &quot;Remarks (or Observations) on the Present System of Roadmaking&quot;, (which ran nine editions between 1816 and 1827) and &quot;A Practical Essay on the Scientific Repair and Preservation of Public Roads,&quot; published in 1819.

===McAdam&#x27;s methods===

McAdam&#x27;s method was simpler yet more effective at protecting roadways: he discovered that massive foundations of rock upon rock were unnecessary and asserted that native soil alone would support the road and traffic upon it, as long as it was covered by a road crust that would protect the soil underneath from water and wear. An under-layer of small angular broken stones would act as a solid mass. Keeping the surface stones smaller than the width of a wheel made for a good running surface. The small surface stones also provided low stress on the road, so long as it could be kept reasonably dry.

Unlike Telford and other road builders of the time, McAdam laid his roads almost level. His road required a rise of only from the edges to the centre. Cambering and elevation of the road above the water table enabled rain water to run off into ditches on either side.

Size of stones was central to McAdam&#x27;s road building theory. The lower road thickness was restricted to stones no larger than . The upper layer of stones was limited to stones in diameter; these were checked by supervisors who carried scales. A workman could check the stone size himself by seeing if the stone would fit into his mouth. The importance of the 2 cm stone size was that the stones needed to be much smaller than the width of the iron carriage wheels that travelled on the road.

McAdam believed that the &quot;proper method&quot; of breaking stones for utility and rapidity was accomplished by people sitting down and using small hammers, breaking the stones so that none of them was larger than in weight. He also wrote that the quality of the road would depend on how carefully the stones were spread on the surface over a sizeable space, one shovelful at a time.

McAdam directed that no substance that would absorb water and affect the road by frost should be incorporated into the road. Neither was anything to be laid on the clean stone to bind the road. The action of the road traffic would cause the broken stone to combine with its own angles, merging into a level, solid surface that would withstand weather or traffic.

===North America===
The first macadam road built in the United States was constructed between Hagerstown and Boonsboro, Maryland, and was named at the time Boonsborough Turnpike Road. This was the last section of unimproved road between Baltimore on the Chesapeake Bay to Wheeling on the Ohio River. Before it was macadamized, stagecoaches travelling the Hagerstown to Boonsboro road in the winter had taken 5 to 7 hours to cover the stretch. 

This road was completed in 1823, using McAdam&#x27;s road techniques, except that the finished road was compacted with a cast iron roller instead of relying on road traffic for compaction. The second American road built using McAdam principles was the Cumberland Road which was long and was completed in 1830 after five years of work.

===McAdam&#x27;s influence===
McAdam&#x27;s renown is his effective and economical construction, which was a great improvement over the methods used by his generation. He emphasised that roads could be constructed for any kind of traffic, and he helped to alleviate the resentment travellers felt toward increasing traffic on the roads. His legacy lies in his advocacy of effective road maintenance and management. He advocated a central road authority with trained professional officials who could be paid a salary that would keep them from corruption. These professionals could give their entire time to these duties and be held responsible for their actions.

==Water-bound macadam==
McAdam&#x27;s road building technology was applied to roads by other engineers. One of these engineers was Richard Edgeworth, who filled the gaps between the surface stones with a mixture of stone dust and water, providing a smoother surface for the increased traffic using the roads. This basic method of construction is sometimes known as water-bound macadam. Although this method required a great deal of manual labour, it resulted in a strong and free-draining pavement. Roads constructed in this manner were described as &quot;macadamized.&quot;

==Tar-bound macadam==


With the advent of motor vehicles, dust became a serious problem on macadam roads. The area of low air pressure created under fast-moving vehicles sucked dust from the road surface, creating dust clouds and a gradual unraveling of the road material. This problem was approached by spraying tar on the surface to create tar-bound macadam. In 1902 a Swiss doctor, Ernest Guglielminetti, came upon the idea of using tar from Monaco&#x27;s gasworks for binding the dust. Later a mixture of coal tar and ironworks slag, patented by Edgar Purnell Hooley as tarmac, was introduced.

A more durable road surface (modern mixed asphalt pavement), sometimes referred to in the U.S. as blacktop, was introduced in the 1920s. Instead of laying the stone and sand aggregates on the road and then spraying the top surface with binding material, in the asphalt paving method the aggregates are thoroughly mixed with the binding material and the mixture is laid all together. While macadam roads have been resurfaced in most developed countries, some are preserved along stretches of roads such as the United States&#x27; National Road.

Because of the historic use of macadam as a road surface, roads in some parts of the United States (such as parts of Pennsylvania) are referred to as macadam, even though they might be made of asphalt or concrete. Similarly, the term &quot;tarmac&quot; is sometimes colloquially applied to asphalt roads or aircraft runways.

<doc id="387884" wikidata="Q2683476" url="?curid=387884" title="Portesham">
<text>Portesham, sometimes also spelt Portisham, is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southwest England, situated in the Dorset Council administrative area approximately northwest of Weymouth, southwest of the county town Dorchester, and northeast of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site at Chesil Beach. The parish is quite large, covering several outlying hamlets and what were once their manors. In the 2011 census it had a population of 685 in 316 households and 342 dwellings.

==Description==
In 1905 Sir Frederick Treves described the village&#x27;s site as being &quot;in a hollow among the downs&quot; so that it was &quot;too low to command a view of the sea&quot;, but nevertheless &quot;in a south-westerly gale the roar of the breakers on the Chesil Beach can be heard in the village.&quot; The houses in Portesham comprise a mix of old grey stone cottages and more modern buildings in various styles. A stream runs alongside the main street.

==History==
The area around Portesham is rich in prehistoric remains. On the hills to the north of the village are several Bronze Age barrows and a Neolithic chambered long barrow called the Hell Stone, which may have been used as a resting place for people awaiting burial in the nearby Valley of Stones.

In 1024 Portesham was granted as a manor by King Canute, firstly to one of his servants, and then to the monastery of Abbotsbury. In 1086 at the time of the Domesday Book the village had 34 households, of meadow and 9 ploughlands. It was in Uggescombe Hundred and the lords and tenants-in-chief were Abbotsbury Abbey and Hawise, wife of Hugh son of Grip.

At the Dissolution of the Monasteries the manor was granted to William Paulet, Lord St. John. It was later held by the Trenchards and then the Ricards, before coming to John, Lord Berkeley of Stratton by marriage.

Running through the parish is an outcrop of Purbeck limestone, which was formerly quarried. Portesham quarry operated in the 19th and early 20th centuries, producing stone that was used in domestic and ecclesiastical buildings within the local area, including Abbotsbury Abbey. A limekiln was sited within the quarry.

A week-long fair was held in early August every year in Portesham until the First World War. Known as &quot;Possum Fes&#x27; Wik&quot;, the event included all-night dancing.

Portesham had a railway station sited across fields to the south of the village, on a branch line between Abbotsbury (the neighbouring village to the west) and Upwey (between Dorchester and Weymouth). The line and station closed in 1952.

Portesham has one public house (Kings Arms) and one shop (Ducks Farm Shop), a combined farm shop and cafe. 

==Governance==
Portesham is in the Chesil Bank electoral ward, which also includes the neighbouring settlements of Abbotsbury, Litton Cheney and Rodden. The total ward population at the 2011 census was 2,094. The ward is one of 32 that comprise the West Dorset parliamentary constituency, which is currently represented in the UK national parliament by Edward Morello, a Liberal Democrat.

==Vice-Admiral Hardy==
Captain Thomas Hardy, one of Lord Nelson&#x27;s commanders at the Battle of Trafalgar, lived in the village. He was born a few miles away at Kingston Russell House, lived in Portesham as a boy, and again as an older man at Portesham House. He affectionately referred to the village as &quot;Possum&quot; and is commemorated by the Hardy Monument, a tower high, erected above the village in 1844 on the top of Black Down and visible over half the county.
==Parish church==

The parish church of St Peter is part of the Dorset Wildlife Trust&#x27;s &quot;Living Churchyard Project&quot; and manages the churchyard for the benefit of wildlife. The grass remains uncut at times, to allow wild flowers to flourish: more than 70 species have been identified. In 2011 the church won Best New Entry in the Living Churchyards competition, and was runner-up in this category in 2012. In 2013 it won the Bishop&#x27;s Prize.

In 1897, the 13th century St Bartholomew&#x27;s Chapel at Corton was consecrated as a chapel of ease to St Peter&#x27;s.

<text>In transport engineering, subgrade is the native material underneath a constructed road, pavement or railway track (US: railroad track). It is also called formation level.

The subgrade provides support to the subbase level and acts as an integral load-bearing layer. Failure of the subgrade can cause depressions and rutting of the upper base and surface courses. These in turn can lead to water pooling in deformations and cause vehicle aquaplaning among other issues.

The term can also refer to imported material that has been used to build an embankment.

==Construction==

Subgrades are commonly compacted before the construction of a road, pavement or railway track. This is to ensure their ability to absorb the loads being transferred down from the upper layers, increasing the life and wear of the surface courses.

<text>Burcott is a hamlet in the civil parish of Bierton, in Buckinghamshire, England. Until 2020 it was in Bierton with Broughton parish.

Its name is common one England, and refers to a fortified cottage. This is probably the stronghold referred to in the place name of Bierton. Adversely Bierton is now the larger place while Burcott has hardly grown at all.

Today the hamlet has been completely swallowed up by the growth of Bierton village, though it is still marked on modern maps. The playing field on which stands Bierton Scout hut marks the boundary between the village and the hamlet.

<text>Rushing is an action taken by the offense, usually the running back, but it can also be the quarterback, that means to advance the ball by running with it, as opposed to passing, or kicking.

==Running==
Rushing, on offense, is running with the ball when starting from behind the line of scrimmage with an intent of gaining yardage. While this usually means a running play, any offensive play that does not involve a forward pass is a rush - also called a run. It is usually done by the running back after a handoff from the quarterback, although quarterbacks and wide receivers can also rush. The quarterback will usually run when a passing play has broken down – such as when there is no receiver open to catch the ball – and there is room to run down the field. A team with a quarterback who is fast and skilled at running may regularly call intentional running plays for that quarterback, but this is rare due to the increased risk of injury. A wide receiver can act as a rusher on several kinds of plays, such as on a reverse, on an end-around, or on a lateral pass behind the line of scrimmage, which is a type of screen pass. However, a wide receiver screen play is usually intended to be a forward pass so that if the receiver drops the ball it is an incomplete pass instead of a fumble.

A rushing attempt may also be referred to as a carry, with any yards gained referred to as rushing yards, as in &quot;the running back had 20 carries for 100 rushing yards.&quot;

<doc id="387904" wikidata="Q14793" url="?curid=387904" title="SIL Global">
<text>SIL Global (formerly known as the Summer Institute of Linguistics International) is an evangelical Christian nonprofit organization whose main purpose is to study, develop and document languages, especially those that are lesser-known, in order to expand linguistic knowledge, promote literacy, translate the Christian Bible into local languages, and aid minority language development.

Based on its language documentation work, SIL publishes a database, &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, of its research into the world&#x27;s languages, and develops and publishes software programs for language documentation, such as FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx) and Lexique Pro.

Its main offices in the United States are located at the International Linguistics Center in Dallas, Texas.

== History ==
William Cameron Townsend, a Presbyterian minister, founded the organization in 1934, after undertaking a Christian mission with the Disciples of Christ among the Kaqchikel Maya people in Guatemala in the early 1930s. In 1933, he turned to Mexico with the purpose of translating the Bible into indigenous languages there, as he had done for Kaqchikel. Townsend established a working relationship with the Mexican Secretariat of Public Education under the government of President Lázaro Cárdenas (in office 1934–1940) and founded SIL to educate linguist-missionaries to work in Mexico. Because the Mexican government did not allow missionary work through its educational system, Townsend founded Wycliffe Bible Translators in 1942 as a separate organization from SIL. Wycliffe Bible Translators focused on Bible translation and missionary activities, whereas SIL focused on linguistic documentation and literacy education.

Having initiated collaboration with the Mexican education authorities, Townsend started the institute as a small summer training-session in Sulphur Springs, Arkansas, in 1934 to train missionaries in basic linguistic, anthropological, and translation principles. Through the following decades the SIL linguists worked at providing literacy education to indigenous people of Mexico, while simultaneously working with the Wycliffe Bible Translators on Bible translation. One of the students at the first summer institute in its second year, 1935, Kenneth Lee Pike (1912–2000), would become the foremost figure in the history of SIL. He served as SIL&#x27;s president from 1942 to 1979, then as president emeritus until his death in 2000.

The Mexican branch, , was established in 1948.

In 2016, Michel Kenmogne from Cameroon became president.

 SIL said it had 1,350 language projects in 98 countries and 4,200 staff from 84 countries.

== Contributions ==
SIL&#x27;s principal contribution to linguistics has been the data that have been gathered and analyzed from over 1,000 minority and endangered languages, many of which had not been previously studied academically. SIL endeavors to share both the data and the results of analysis in order to contribute to the overall knowledge of language. This has resulted in publications on languages such as Hixkaryana and Pirahã, which have challenged the universality of some linguistic theories. SIL&#x27;s work has resulted in over 20,000 technical publications, all of which are listed in the SIL Bibliography. Most of these are a reflection of linguistic fieldwork.

SIL&#x27;s focus has not been on the development of new linguistic theories, but tagmemics, though no longer promoted by SIL, was developed by Kenneth Pike, who also coined the words emic and etic, more widely used today in anthropology.

Another focus of SIL is literacy work, particularly in indigenous languages. SIL assists local, regional, and national agencies that are developing formal and informal education in vernacular languages. These cooperative efforts enable new advances in the complex field of educational development in multilingual and multicultural societies.

SIL provides instructors and instructional materials for linguistics programs at several major institutions of higher learning around the world. In the United States, these include Dallas International University, Biola University, Moody Bible Institute, and Dallas Theological Seminary. Other universities with SIL programs include Trinity Western University in Canada, Charles Darwin University in Australia, and Universidad Ricardo Palma in Lima, Peru.

The organization has recently established a new Language and Culture Documentation Services Unit that aims to preserve and revitalize languages threatened by extinction. The creation of this department reflects a growing interest in documenting endangered languages and incorporates a multidisciplinary approach of anthropology and linguistics.

== Affiliations ==
SIL has Consultative Status with UNESCO as an NGO, and has Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) as an advocate for ethnolinguistic communities.

The organization is a member of the Forum of Bible Agencies International and Micah Network, and is a founding member of Maaya, the World Network for Linguistic Diversity.

== Methodological contributions ==
=== Ethnologue and ISO 639-3 codes ===
&quot;Ethnologue: A Guide to the World&#x27;s Languages&quot; has been published by SIL since 1951.

From the 13th edition (1997) onwards, the entire contents of the published book were also shared online. From the 17th edition onwards (2013) the publication shifted to a web-centric paradigm, meaning that the website is now the primary means by which the database is accessed. Among other advantages, this greatly facilitates user contributions. A new edition is now published every February. The 27th edition was released in February 2024 and lists 7,164 languages.

Starting with the 16th edition (2009), &quot;Ethnologue&quot; uses the ISO 639-3 standard, which assigns 3-letter codes to languages; these were derived in part from the 3-letter codes that were used in the &quot;Ethnologue&quot;&#x27;s 15th edition. SIL is the registration authority for the ISO 639-3 standard.

With the publication of the 17th edition (2016), Ethnologue launched a subscription service, but claiming that the paywall would only affect 5% of users. Users who contribute over 100 accepted changes are rewarded with lifetime free access.

A comprehensive review of the 16th, 17th and 18th editions acknowledged that &quot;[Ethnologue] is at present still better than any other nonderivative work of the same scope&quot; except that &quot;[it] fails to disclose the sources for the information presented.

=== Software ===
SIL has developed widely used software for linguistic research.
* Adapt It is a tool for translating text from one language into a related language after performing limited linguistic analysis.
* In the field of lexicon collection, ShoeBox, the newer ToolBox (Field Linguist&#x27;s Toolbox), and Lexique Pro have largely been replaced by FieldWorks Language Explorer (FLEx Windows and Linux) for linguists and WeSay (also Windows and Linux) for non-professionals. SIL also provides a &quot;Webonary&quot; website for publishing dictionaries.
* Graphite is a smart-font technology and rendering system.
* Keyman is a keyboard software solution for typing over 2000 of the world&#x27;s languages and can be used to make custom keyboards.

=== Fonts ===
SIL has developed several widely used font sets that it makes available as free software under the SIL Open Font License (OFL). The names of SIL fonts reflect the Biblical mission of the organization &quot;charis&quot; (Greek for &quot;grace&quot;), &quot;doulos&quot; (Greek for &quot;servant&quot;) and &quot;gentium&quot; (Latin for &quot;of the nations&quot;). These fonts have become standard resources for linguists working on the documentation of the world&#x27;s languages. Most of them are designed only for specific writing systems, such as Ethiopic, Devanagari, New Tai Lue, Hebrew, Arabic, Khmer, Yi, Myanmar, Coptic, and Tai Viet, or some more technical notation, such as cipher musical notation or IPA. Fonts that support Latin include:
* Gentium: &quot;a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supports a wide range of Latin- and Cyrillic-based alphabets.&quot;
* Doulos SIL: &quot;a Unicode serif font similar in design to Times/Times New Roman. It contains a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and symbols useful to linguists. It contains near-complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode 7.0 for Latin and Cyrillic.&quot;
*Charis SIL: &quot;a Unicode-based font family that supports the wide range of languages that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. It is specially designed to make long texts pleasant and easy to read, even in less than ideal reproduction and display environments.&quot;
* Andika: &quot;a sans serif Unicode font designed especially for literacy use and the needs of beginning readers. The focus is on clear letterforms that will not be easily confused with one another. It supports near-complete coverage for Latin and Cyrillic.&quot;

== Recognitions ==
The 1947 Summer Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America passed a resolution that the work of SIL &quot;should be strongly commended by our Society and welcomed as one of the most promising developments in applied linguistics in this country.&quot;

SIL holds formal consultative status with UNESCO and the United Nations, and has been publicly recognized by UNESCO for their work in many parts of Asia. SIL also holds non-governmental organization status in many countries.

SIL&#x27;s work has received appreciation and recognition in a number of international settings. In 1973, SIL was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding. This foundation honors outstanding individuals and organizations working in Asia who manifest greatness of spirit in service to the peoples of Asia. UNESCO Literacy Prizes have been awarded to SIL&#x27;s work in a number of countries: Australia (1969), Cameroon (1986), Papua New Guinea (1979), Philippines (1991).

==Criticism==
In 1979, SIL&#x27;s agreement was officially terminated by the Mexican government after critiques from anthropologists regarding the combination of education and missionary activities in indigenous communities, though SIL continued to be active in that country. At a conference of the Inter-American Indian Institute in Mérida, Yucatán, in November 1980, delegates denounced the Summer Institute of Linguistics, charging that it was using a scientific name to conceal its Protestant agenda and an alleged capitalist view that was alien to indigenous traditions. This led to the agreement with the Ecuadoran government being terminated in 1980, although a token presence remained. In the early 1990s, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) demanded the expulsion of SIL from the country. SIL was also expelled from Brazil, Mexico, and Panama, and restricted in Colombia and Peru.

The organization&#x27;s focus on language description, language development and Bible translation, and the missionary activities carried out by many of its field workers have been criticized by linguists and anthropologists who argue that SIL aims to change indigenous cultures, which exacerbates the problems that cause language endangerment and language death. Linguists have argued that the missionary focus of SIL makes relations with academic linguists and their reliance on SIL software and knowledge infrastructure problematic in that respective goals, while often overlapping, also sometimes diverge considerably.

SIL does not consider efforts to change cultural patterns a form of culture destruction and points out that all their work is based on the voluntary participation of indigenous peoples. In the SIL view, ethnocide is not a valid concept and it would lead to pessimism to characterize culture change resulting from the inevitable progress of civilization as ethnocide. SIL considers itself as actively protecting endangered languages by promoting them within the speech community and providing mother-tongue literacy training. Additionally, their expanded interest in preserving threatened languages has resulted in the creation of a Language and Culture Documentation Services Unit.

<text>Montrose is an area located in west-central Houston, Texas, United States and is one of the city&#x27;s major cultural areas. Montrose is a area roughly bounded by Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 to the south, Allen Parkway to the north, South Shepherd Drive to the west, and Taft to Fairview to Bagby to Highway 59 to Main to the east. Montrose neighborhoods include Cherryhurst, Courtlandt Place, Hyde Park, Montrose, Vermont Commons, North and East Montrose, Mandell Place and Winlow Place. Montrose is also less well known by the moniker Neartown, encompassing Superneighborhood #24.

== History ==
Neartown has many of Houston&#x27;s oldest neighborhoods. The Neartown Association began in 1963. Houston&#x27;s urban real estate boom starting in the 1990s transformed Neartown and significantly increased property values.

The City of Houston&#x27;s Planning Department refers to Neartown as a mixed-use community. Since the 1990s gentrification, musicians and artists are being replaced with higher paid professionals (attorneys, educators, medical professionals) due to higher rents. Montrose has &quot;wound a tortuous course from Silk Stocking and Low Rent and back again.&quot; In 1997 Katherine Feser of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated that &quot;Montrose [is] not for starving artists anymore&quot;.

On June 6, 2006, a teenage MS-13 gang member named Gabriel Granillo was stabbed to death at Ervan Chew Park.

==Culture==
The River Oaks Shopping Center, Houston&#x27;s first shopping center, is located in Neartown, east of River Oaks. Constructed in 1927 and designed by architect Hugh Prather, the center, originally known as River Oaks Community Center, was one of the nation&#x27;s first automobile-oriented retail centers. Its design, with arcs of retail space on either side of West Gray Avenue, was considered a model for future development. Portions of the historic shopping center were demolished in September 2007 to redevelop the site for bookstore and a parking garage. As of 2008, Landmark Theatres operates the River Oaks Theatre, an &quot;arthouse&quot; theater, located in the center. The theater is the last historic movie theater in Houston that is still being used as it was originally designed.

==Cityscape==
Neartown was described in 1973 as &quot;old buildings ranging all the way from Victorian Epic to Ramshackle Plywood.&quot; Neartown has European-style restaurants and sidewalk cafés along five blocks of Westheimer with many housed in renovated pre-World War I houses. The Neartown neighborhood along Van Buren Street was the &quot;Houston Press&quot; &quot;Best Hidden Neighborhood&quot; in 2002.

==Demographics==
In 2015 the Houston city government-defined Neartown/Montrose Super Neighborhood had 31,037 residents. 71% were non-Hispanic white, 18% were Hispanic, 6% were non-Hispanic Asians, 4% were non-Hispanic blacks, and 1% were non-Hispanic others. In 2000 the super neighborhood had 28,015 people. 68% were non-Hispanic whites, 23% were Hispanic, 4% each were non-Hispanic black and Asian, and 2% were non-Hispanic others.

<text>Raymond John Leppard (11 August 1927 – 22 October 2019) was a British-American conductor, harpsichordist, composer and editor. In the 1960s, he played a prime role in the rebirth of interest in Baroque music; in particular, he was one of the first major conductors to perform Baroque opera, reviving works by Claudio Monteverdi and Francesco Cavalli. He conducted operas at major international opera houses and festivals, including the Glyndebourne Festival where he led the world premiere of Nicholas Maw&#x27;s &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot;, the Metropolitan Opera and the Royal Opera House. He composed film scores such as &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; and &quot;Alfred the Great&quot;.

== Life and career ==
Leppard (pronounced LEPP-ard) was born in London and grew up in Bath, Somerset, where he was educated at the City of Bath Boys&#x27; School, now known as the Beechen Cliff School. He studied harpsichord and viola at Trinity College, Cambridge, and became interested in choral conducting.

In 1952, he made his London debut at Wigmore Hall in London, conducted his own Leppard Ensemble. He became closely associated with the Goldsbrough Orchestra, which became the English Chamber Orchestra in 1960. Also, he gave recitals as harpsichordist, and was a fellow of Trinity College and a lecturer in music from 1958 to 1968. He retired from his post as Director of Music at Trinity College in 1968.
His interest in early music prompted him to prepare several realisations of scores from the period. While musicologists considered his editions controversial, his performances were important for introducing early operatic masterpieces to the general public. In 1962, he prepared a performing score of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot; for a production at the Glyndebourne Festival. He subsequently edited Monteverdi&#x27;s other surviving stage works, &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; and &quot;Il ritorno d&#x27;Ulisse in patria&quot;, as well as operas by Francesco Cavalli and Jean-Philippe Rameau. He conducted several of his realisations both in the theatre and in the recording studio.

In 1963, he composed the original film score for Peter Brook&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, the adaptation of William Golding&#x27;s novel. His other film work included composing the score to &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (1969), and arranging the music for &quot;Laughter in the Dark&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; (1984).

In November 1969, he made his American debut conducting the Westminster Choir and the New York Philharmonic, at which occasion he also appeared as soloist in Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Harpsichord Concerto in D major. In 1973 he became principal conductor of the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra in Manchester (now the BBC Philharmonic), a position he retained until 1980.

Leppard conducted Britten&#x27;s &quot;Billy Budd&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera and the San Francisco Opera, as well as Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot; and Handel&#x27;s &quot;Alcina&quot; at the New York City Opera. He also conducted at the Royal Opera House in London, in Paris, at the Hamburg State Opera, the Santa Fe Opera, in Stockholm and Geneva.

In September 1986 Raymond Leppard conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Singers and Chorus at the Last Night of the Proms in the Royal Albert Hall, London.

At Glyndebourne, he conducted the world premiere of Nicholas Maw&#x27;s &quot;The Rising of the Moon&quot;. From 1987 to 2001, Leppard was the music director of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, where he collaborated with concertmaster Hidetaro Suzuki. From 2004 to 2006, he served as music advisor to the Louisville Orchestra.

In 1973, the Republic of Italy conferred upon him the title of Commendatore della Republica Italiana for services to Italian music. He received an Honorary Degree of a Doctor of Letters by the University of Bath in 1973. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 1983. Leppard became an American citizen in 2003. He died in Indianapolis on 22 October 2019. He bequeathed his extensive archive of opera realisations to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.

Leppard received a total of 7 Grammy Award nominations during his career:

* Best Opera Recording in 1970 (for &quot;L&#x27;Ormindo)&quot;
* Best Choral Performance in 1973 (for &quot;Monteverdi: Madrigals, Books 8, 9 &amp; 10)&quot;

<text>Viktor Ivanovich Belenko (; February 15, 1947 – September 24, 2023) was a Russian-born American aerospace engineer and Soviet pilot who defected in 1976 to the West while flying his MiG-25 &quot;Foxbat&quot; jet interceptor and landed in Hakodate, Japan. George H. W. Bush, the Director of Central Intelligence at the time, called the opportunity to examine the plane up close an &quot;intelligence bonanza&quot; for the West. Belenko later became a U.S. aerospace engineer.

==Early life and defection==

Belenko was born in Nalchik, Russian SFSR, in a Russian family (his passport states his ethnicity as Russian). Lieutenant Belenko was a pilot with the 513th Fighter Regiment, 11th Air Army, Soviet Air Defence Forces based in Chuguyevka, Primorsky Krai. On 6 September 1976, he successfully defected to the West by flying his MiG-25 jet fighter to Hakodate Airport in Hokkaido, Japan.

This was the first time that Western military intelligence were able to get a close look at the aircraft and its specifications, and many secrets and surprises were revealed. His defection caused significant damage to the Soviet Air Force. Belenko was granted asylum by U.S. President Gerald Ford, and a trust fund was set up for him, which granted him a very comfortable living in later years. The US government debriefed him for five months after his defection and employed him as a consultant for several years thereafter. Belenko had brought with him the pilot&#x27;s manual for the MiG-25 since he expected to assist US pilots in evaluating and testing the aircraft.

Belenko was not the only pilot to have defected from the Soviet Union in this way or even the first to defect from a Soviet-bloc country. He might have been aware of the US government&#x27;s policy of awarding large cash prizes to defecting pilots of communist countries. In March and May 1953, two Polish Air Force pilots Lieutenant Franciszek Jarecki and Lieutenant Zdzisław Jaźwiński flew MiG-15s to Denmark. Later in 1953, North Korean pilot No Kum Sok flew his MiG-15 to a US air base in South Korea; the MiG is in the permanent collection of the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, displayed in its original owner markings. Later, Soviet Captain Aleksandr Zuyev flew his MiG-29 to Trabzon, Turkey, on 20 May 1989. That MiG-29 was promptly returned to the Soviets.

==Aftermath==
The MiG-25&#x27;s arrival in Japan was a windfall for Western military planners. The Japanese government had originally allowed the United States to examine the plane and to conduct ground tests of the radar and engines only; however, it subsequently allowed the US to dismantle the plane to examine it extensively. The plane was moved by a US Air Force C-5 Galaxy cargo aircraft from Hakodate to Hyakuri Air Base on 25 September, and by then, experts had determined that the plane was an interceptor, not a fighter-bomber, which was a welcome reassurance for Japanese defense planners.

On 2 October 1976, the Japanese Government announced that it would ship the aircraft in crates from the port of Hitachi and billed the Soviets US$40,000 for crating services and airfield damage at Hakodate. The Soviets responded with a request to return the plane via their own Antonov An-22 aircraft after a rigorous inspection of the crates. The Japanese government refused, and the Soviets finally submitted to the Japanese terms on 22 October 1976. The aircraft was moved from Hyakuri to the port of Hitachi on 11 November 1976 on a convoy of trailers. It left in 30 crates aboard the Soviet cargo ship &quot;Taigonos&quot; on 15 November 1976 and arrived about three days later in Vladivostok. A team of Soviet technicians had been allowed to view subassemblies at Hitachi, and upon finding 20 missing parts, one being film of the flight to Hakodate, the Soviets attempted to charge Japan US $10 million. Neither the Japanese nor the Soviet bill is known to have been paid.

A senior diplomat described the Soviet position as &quot;sulky about the whole affair.&quot; The CIA concluded at the time that &quot;both countries seem anxious to put the problem behind them&quot; and speculated that the Soviets were reluctant to cancel a series of upcoming diplomatic visits because &quot;some useful business is likely to be transacted, and because the USSR, with its political standing in Tokyo so low, can ill-afford setbacks in Soviet–Japanese economic cooperation.&quot;

==Life in the United States==
Belenko started a new life in the United States. In 1980, the US Congress enacted S. 2961, authorizing citizenship for him, which was signed into law by President Jimmy Carter on 14 October 1980, as Private Law 96-62. Eager to avoid attention, and reprisal from the Soviet Union, he took the surname Schmidt and moved around often, mostly living in small towns across the Midwest. He worked as a consultant to aerospace companies and government agencies, and married a music teacher from North Dakota, Coral Garaas. They had two sons before divorcing.

The Soviet Union repeatedly spread false stories about Belenko being killed in a car accident, returning to Russia, being arrested and executed, or otherwise brought to justice. Russian journalists claimed that Belenko allegedly also had a son from his first marriage, never divorced his first wife, and never provided child support to her after his defection, but Belenko denied this. The journalists also claimed that his Soviet wife appealed for his return after his defection. 

Belenko co-wrote a 1980 autobiography, &quot;MiG Pilot: The Final Escape of Lieutenant Belenko&quot; with &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; writer John Barron, which confirmed that he had a wife and son in the USSR, although Belenko had previously told his son that this was Soviet propaganda.

Belenko almost never appeared in interviews during his life in the United States. He feared for his life until the day he died. However, in a brief and informal bar interview in 2000, he said that he was happy in the United States, remarking, &quot;[Americans] have tolerance regarding other people&#x27;s opinion. In certain cultures, if you do not accept the mainstream, you would be booted out or might disappear. Here we have people—you know, who hug trees, and people who want to cut them down—and they live side by side!&quot; In this interview he also claimed that he visited Moscow but did not provide any evidence of his trip.

Viktor Belenko died in a nursing home in the small town of Red Bud, Illinois on September 24, 2023, at the age of 76. 
He is survived by two sons and four grandchildren. However, journalists learned about his death only at the end of November. One of his sons told the newspaper that his father had died after a short illness. There was no memorial service.

<doc id="387917" wikidata="Q5531504" url="?curid=387917" title="Gene Tyranny">
<text>Robert Nathan Sheff (January 1, 1945 – December 12, 2020), known professionally as &quot;Blue&quot; Gene Tyranny, was an American avant-garde composer and pianist.

&quot;His memorable pseudonym, coined during his brief stint with Iggy and the Stooges, was derived partly from Jean, his adoptive mother’s middle name,&quot; wrote Steve Smith, in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary for Tyranny. &quot;It also referred to what he called &#x27;the tyranny of the genes&#x27; — a predisposition to being &#x27;strongly overcome by emotion,&#x27; he said in &quot;Just for the Record: Conversations With and About ‘Blue’ Gene Tyranny&quot;, a documentary film.&quot;

== Early life ==
Tyranny was born Joseph Gantic in San Antonio on January 1, 1945, to William and Eleanor Gantic. Later that year, after his birth father, an Army paratrooper, went missing in the Asian theater of World War II, his mother put him up for adoption. He was adopted by Dorothy and Meyer Sheff of San Antonio, who changed his name to Robert Nathan Sheff. Tyranny was raised in the Lutheran church. He studied piano with Meta Hertwig and Rodney Hoare, and composition with Otto Wick and Frank Hughes.

== Career ==
Tyranny began his performance career in high school, playing pieces by major composers (such as John Cage) with Philip Krumm in a concert series in San Antonio. He toured with the Carla Bley Band in 1977 and the Prime Movers (which included Iggy Pop and Michael Erlewine) as well as Iggy &amp; The Stooges. &quot;After releasing the album &quot;Raw Power&quot; in 1973, [Pop] invited his former bandmate to join him on tour,&quot; Steve Smith noted in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary for Tyranny. &quot;Mr. Tyranny accepted, performing with red LED lights woven into his hair.&quot; He performed on albums by Laurie Anderson (&quot;Strange Angels&quot;), David Behrman (&quot;On the Other Ocean&quot;), John Cage (&quot;Cheap Imitation&quot; and &quot;Empty Words&quot;), Peter Gordon, and Robert Ashley (&quot;Perfect Lives, Dust, Celestial Excursions&quot;), with whom he frequently collaborated. Tyranny composed and performed the song &quot;Choral Ode 3&quot; for the 1993 opera &quot;Agamemnon&quot;.

He taught at Mills College from 1971 to 1982, where his students included composer Hsiung-Zee Wong, and also worked at the Center for Contemporary Music at Mills. He moved to New York in 1983 and received a Bessie in 1988 and in 1989 a Composer Fellowship from the NY Foundation for the Arts.

Tyranny was a contributor for AllMusic, reviewing albums and creating biographies for many notable contemporary artists.

According to Kyle Gann in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, Tyranny had &quot;Cecil Taylor&#x27;s keyboard energy [and] Morton Feldman&#x27;s ear.&quot; &quot;The most original aspect of [his] works,&quot; wrote Gann, &quot;is the way they create continuity: they&#x27;re tonal, yet rigorously asymmetrical. They satisfy the ear without letting it take anything for granted. They evolve...with the labyrinthine irreversibility of deep psychic forces.&quot; In another &quot;Voice&quot; article, Gann was lyrical in his evocation of Tyranny&#x27;s virtuosity: &quot;God plays the piano through this man. Science cannot explain the speed with which trillions of inspired brain impulses zip through his...hands, resulting in note-perfect works...the 1988 Kitchen improv-with-delay [The Intermediary Following Traces of the Song]...I called &#x27;the most inspired piano performance I&#x27;ve ever heard.&#x27; It still is. At his schmaltziest (&quot;Sunrise or Sunset in Texas&quot;) he&#x27;s like Keith Jarrett on an extremely good day. At his best, it&#x27;s like listening to Ives improvise &#x27;Hawthorne&#x27; from the Concord Sonata.&quot;

In October 2020, &quot;Just for the Record: Conversations With and About &quot;Blue&quot; Gene Tyranny&quot;, a documentary film directed by David Bernabo, premiered at the TUSK Festival 2020. In a review of the film for &quot;The Wire&quot;, Joshua Minsoo Kim wrote, &quot;Hearing Tyranny talk and learning how he lived his life encourages one to go the same way.&quot;

Tyranny died in hospice in Long Island City, Queens, on December 12, 2020, of complications of diabetes.

In David Bernabo&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Just for the Record: Conversations With and About ‘Blue’ Gene Tyranny&quot;, Tyranny said music was a source of solace, but also a means “of deeply informing myself that there’s another world. Music is my way of being in the world.”

<text>A T-square is a technical drawing instrument used by draftsmen primarily as a guide for drawing horizontal lines on a drafting table. The instrument is named after its resemblance to the letter T, with a long shaft called the &quot;blade&quot; and a short shaft called the &quot;stock&quot; or &quot;head&quot;. T-squares are available in a range of sizes, with common lengths being , , , and .

In addition to drawing horizontal lines, a T-square can be used with a set square to draw vertical or diagonal lines. The T-square usually has a transparent edge made of plastic which should be free of nicks and cracks in order to provide smooth, straight lines.

T-squares are also used in various industries, such as construction. For example, drywall T-squares are typically made of aluminum and have a tongue, allowing them to be used for measuring and cutting drywall. In woodworking, higher-end table saws often have T-square fences attached to a rail on the front side of the table, providing improved accuracy and precision when cutting wood.

<text>Morton Subotnick (born April 14, 1933) is an American composer of electronic music, best known for his 1967 composition &quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot;, the first electronic work commissioned by a record company, Nonesuch. He was one of the founding members of California Institute of the Arts, where he taught for many years.

Subotnick has worked extensively with interactive electronics and multi-media, co-founding the San Francisco Tape Music Center with Pauline Oliveros and Ramon Sender, often collaborating with his wife Joan La Barbara. Morton Subotnick is one of the pioneers in the development of electronic music and multi-media performance and an innovator in works involving instruments and other media, including interactive computer music systems. Most of his music calls for a computer part, or live electronic processing; his oeuvre utilizes many of the important technological breakthroughs in the history of the genre.

==Early career==

Subotnick was born in Los Angeles, California, and graduated from the University of Denver. In the early 1960s, Subotnick taught at Mills College and with Ramon Sender, he co-founded the San Francisco Tape Music Center. During this period he also collaborated with Anna Halprin on two works (&quot;the 3 legged stool&quot; and &quot;Parades and Changes&quot;) and acted as music director of the Actors Workshop.

In 1966 Subotnick was instrumental in getting a Rockefeller Grant to join the Tape Center with the Mills Chamber Players (a chamber group at Mills College with performers Nate Rubin (violin); Bonnie Hampton (cello); Naomi Sparrow (piano) and Subotnick on clarinet). The grant required that the Tape Center relocate to a host institution that became Mills College. Subotnick, however, did not stay with the move, but went to New York with the Actor&#x27;s Workshop to become the first music director of the Lincoln Center Rep Company in the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. Along with Len Lye, he became an artist in residence at the newly formed Tisch School of the Arts at NYU. The School of the Arts provided him with a studio and a Buchla Synthesizer (now at the Library of Congress). He then helped to develop the Electric Circus and the Electric Ear, and became their artistic director. At the same time he created &quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot;, &quot;The Wild Bull&quot;, and &quot;Touch&quot;.

==&quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot;==
Early electronic music was made using wave generators and tape-manipulated sounds. Subotnick was among the first composers to work with electronic instrument designer Don Buchla. Buchla&#x27;s modular voltage-controlled synthesizer, which he called the Electric Music Box and which was constructed partly based on suggestions by Subotnick and Sender, was both more flexible and easier to use, and its sequencing ability was integral to Subotnick&#x27;s music.

In the late 1960s, a time when much United States&#x27; academic &quot;avant-gardist&quot; electronic music was highly abstract, (largely concerned with pitch and timbre, where (metric) rhythm might be an afterthought or of no consequence, and simple patterned structures were largely avoided), Subotnick broke with this direction by including sections with metric rhythms – those based on pulses and beats. Both &quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot; and 1968&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Bull&quot; (another Nonesuch-commissioned work for tape; they have since been combined on a Wergo CD) have been choreographed by dance companies around the world.

In 1969 Subotnick was invited to be part of a team of artists to move to Los Angeles to plan a new school. Mel Powell as Dean, Subotnick as Associate Dean, and a team of four other pairs of artists carved out a new path of music education and created the now famous California Institute of the Arts. Subotnick remained Associate Dean of the music school for 4 years and then, resigning from that position, became the head of the composition program where, a few years later, he created a new media program that introduced interactive technology and multimedia into the curriculum. In 1978 Subotnick, with Roger Reynolds and Bernard Rands, produced 5 annual internationally acclaimed new music festivals.

==Approach to music==
Where previous electronic music had used non-traditional structures, Subotnick&#x27;s electronic compositions are structured more like the classical music for acoustic instruments with which audiences are familiar, but with nontraditional timbres and pitch manipulations no orchestra could produce. He has also written for acoustic instruments, and he has studied with Darius Milhaud and Leon Kirchner at Mills College in Oakland, California.

In addition to music in the electronic medium, Subotnick has written for symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, theater and multimedia productions. His &quot;staged tone poem” &quot;The Double Life of Amphibians&quot;, a collaboration with director Lee Breuer and visual artist Irving Petlin, utilizing live interaction between singers, instrumentalists and computer, was premiered at the 1984 Olympics Arts Festival in Los Angeles.

The concert version of &quot;Jacob’s Room&quot;, a mono drama commissioned by Betty Freeman for the Kronos Quartet and singer Joan La Barbara, received its premiere in San Francisco in 1985. Jacob&#x27;s Room, Subotnick&#x27;s multimedia opera chamber opera (directed by Herbert Blau with video imagery by Steina and Woody Vasulka, featuring Joan La Barbara), received its premiere in Philadelphia in April 1993 under the auspices of The American Music Theater Festival. &quot;The Key To Songs&quot;, for chamber orchestra and computer, was premiered at the 1985 Aspen Music Festival. &quot;Return&quot;, commissioned to celebrate the return of Halley&#x27;s Comet, premiered with an accompanying sky show in the planetarium of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles in 1986. Subotnick&#x27;s recent works—among them &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Room&quot;, &quot;The Key to Songs&quot;, &quot;Hunger&quot;, &quot;In Two Worlds&quot;, &quot;And the Butterflies Begin to Sing&quot; and &quot;A Desert Flowers&quot;—utilize computerized sound generation, specially designed software Interactor and &quot;intelligent&quot; computer controls which allow the performers to interact with the computer technology.

&quot;All My Hummingbirds Have Alibis&quot; (1994) was an interactive concert work and a CD-ROM (perhaps the first of its kind), &quot;Making Music&quot; (1995), &quot;Making More Music&quot; (1998) were his first works for children, and an interactive &#x27;Media Poem&#x27;, &quot;Intimate Immensity&quot;, premiered at the Lincoln Center Festival in NY (1997). The European premiere (1998) was in Karlsruhe, Germany. A string quartet with CDROM, &quot;Echoes from the Silent Call of Girona&quot; (1998), was premiered in Los Angeles by Southwest Chamber Music.

Subotnick was commissioned to complete a larger version of the opera, &quot;Jacobs Room&quot;. This premiered in 2010 at the Bregenz Festival in Austria.

Subotnick is developing tools for young children to create music. He has authored a series of six CDROMs for children, mounted a children&#x27;s website and he is developing a related school program. Subotnick&#x27;s Pitch Painter for iPad and iPhone (not available on App Store) is a musical finger painting app which presents a new intuitive way for kids to create music.

Subotnick is working with the Library of Congress as they are preparing an archival presentation of his electronic works. He tours extensively throughout the U.S. and Europe as a lecturer and composer/performer. Morton Subotnick is published by Schott Music. Students of his include Ingram Marshall, Mark Coniglio, Carl Stone, Rhys Chatham, Charlemagne Palestine, Ann Millikan, Nicholas Frances Chase, Brian Evans, Julia Stilman-Lasansky, John King, Lois V Vierk, Betty Ann Wong, and Jeremy Zuckerman.

==Personal life==
Subotnick is married to Joan La Barbara, a singer and composer. Subotnick&#x27;s older son, Steven Subotnick, is an animator; his younger son, Jacob Subotnick, is a sound designer and his daughter, Tamara Winer, is a psychiatric social worker.

<text>A French curve is a template usually made from metal, wood or plastic composed of many different curved segments. It is used in manual drafting and in fashion design to draw smooth curves of varying radii. The curve is placed on the drawing material, and a pencil, knife or other implement is traced around its curves to produce the desired result. They were invented by the German mathematician Ludwig Burmester and are also known as Burmester (curve) set.

== Clothing design ==
French curves are used in fashion design and sewing alongside hip curves, straight edges and right-angle rulers. Commercial clothing patterns can be personalized for fit by using French curves to draw neckline, sleeve, bust and waist variations.

<text>Metalogic is the metatheory of logic. Whereas &quot;logic&quot; studies how logical systems can be used to construct valid and sound arguments, metalogic studies the properties of logical systems. Logic concerns the truths that may be derived using a logical system; metalogic concerns the truths that may be derived &quot;about&quot; the languages and systems that are used to express truths.

The basic objects of metalogical study are formal languages, formal systems, and their interpretations. The study of interpretation of formal systems is the branch of mathematical logic that is known as model theory, and the study of deductive systems is the branch that is known as proof theory.

== Overview ==

=== Formal language ===
A &quot;formal language&quot; is an organized set of symbols, the symbols of which precisely define it by shape and place. Such a language therefore can be defined without reference to the meanings of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it—that is, before it has any meaning. First-order logic is expressed in some formal language. A formal grammar determines which symbols and sets of symbols are formulas in a formal language.

A formal language can be formally defined as a set &quot;A&quot; of strings (finite sequences) on a fixed alphabet α. Some authors, including Rudolf Carnap, define the language as the ordered pair &lt;α, &quot;A&quot;&gt;. Carnap also requires that each element of α must occur in at least one string in &quot;A&quot;.

=== Formation rules ===
&quot;Formation rules&quot; (also called &quot;formal grammar&quot;) are a precise description of the well-formed formulas of a formal language. They are synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language that constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean).

=== Formal systems ===
A &quot;formal system&quot; (also called a &quot;logical calculus&quot;, or a &quot;logical system&quot;) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a &quot;deductive system&quot;). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called &quot;inference rules&quot;) or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions.

A &quot;formal system&quot; can be formally defined as an ordered triple &lt;α,formula_1,formula_2d&gt;, where formula_2d is the relation of direct derivability. This relation is understood in a comprehensive sense such that the primitive sentences of the formal system are taken as directly derivable from the empty set of sentences. Direct derivability is a relation between a sentence and a finite, possibly empty set of sentences. Axioms are so chosen that every first place member of formula_2d is a member of formula_1 and every second place member is a finite subset of formula_1.

A &quot;formal system&quot; can also be defined with only the relation formula_2d. Thereby can be omitted formula_1 and α in the definitions of &quot;interpreted formal language&quot;, and &quot;interpreted formal system&quot;. However, this method can be more difficult to understand and use.

=== Formal proofs ===
A &quot;formal proof&quot; is a sequence of well-formed formulas of a formal language, the last of which is a theorem of a formal system. The theorem is a syntactic consequence of all the well formed formulae that precede it in the proof system. For a well formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must result from applying a rule of the deductive apparatus of some formal system to the previous well formed formulae in the proof sequence.

=== Interpretations ===
An &quot;interpretation&quot; of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols and truth-values to the sentences of the formal system. The study of interpretations is called Formal semantics. &quot;Giving an interpretation&quot; is synonymous with &quot;constructing a model&quot;.

== Important distinctions ==

=== Metalanguage–object language ===

In metalogic, formal languages are sometimes called &quot;object languages&quot;. The language used to make statements about an object language is called a &quot;metalanguage&quot;. This distinction is a key difference between logic and metalogic. While logic deals with &quot;proofs in a formal system&quot;, expressed in some formal language, metalogic deals with &quot;proofs about a formal system&quot; which are expressed in a metalanguage about some object language.

=== Syntax–semantics ===
In metalogic, &#x27;syntax&#x27; has to do with formal languages or formal systems without regard to any interpretation of them, whereas, &#x27;semantics&#x27; has to do with interpretations of formal languages. The term &#x27;syntactic&#x27; has a slightly wider scope than &#x27;proof-theoretic&#x27;, since it may be applied to properties of formal languages without any deductive systems, as well as to formal systems. &#x27;Semantic&#x27; is synonymous with &#x27;model-theoretic&#x27;.

=== Use–mention ===
In metalogic, the words &quot;use&quot; and &quot;mention&quot;, in both their noun and verb forms, take on a technical sense in order to identify an important distinction. The &quot;use–mention distinction&quot; (sometimes referred to as the &quot;words-as-words distinction&quot;) is the distinction between &quot;using&quot; a word (or phrase) and &quot;mentioning&quot; it. Usually it is indicated that an expression is being mentioned rather than used by enclosing it in quotation marks, printing it in italics, or setting the expression by itself on a line. The enclosing in quotes of an expression gives us the name of an expression, for example:

=== Type–token ===
The &quot;type-token distinction&quot; is a distinction in metalogic, that separates an abstract concept from the objects which are particular instances of the concept. For example, the particular bicycle in your garage is a token of the type of thing known as &quot;The bicycle.&quot; Whereas, the bicycle in your garage is in a particular place at a particular time, that is not true of &quot;the bicycle&quot; as used in the sentence: &quot;&quot;The bicycle&quot; has become more popular recently.&quot; This distinction is used to clarify the meaning of symbols of formal languages.

== History ==
Metalogical questions have been asked since the time of Aristotle. However, it was only with the rise of formal languages in the late 19th and early 20th century that investigations into the foundations of logic began to flourish. In 1904, David Hilbert observed that in investigating the foundations of mathematics that logical notions are presupposed, and therefore a simultaneous account of metalogical and metamathematical principles was required. Today, metalogic and metamathematics are largely synonymous with each other, and both have been substantially subsumed by mathematical logic in academia. A possible alternate, less mathematical model may be found in the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce and other semioticians.

== Results ==

Results in metalogic consist of such things as formal proofs demonstrating the consistency, completeness, and decidability of particular formal systems.

Major results in metalogic include:

* Proof of the uncountability of the power set of the natural numbers (Cantor&#x27;s theorem 1891)
* Löwenheim–Skolem theorem (Leopold Löwenheim 1915 and Thoralf Skolem 1919)
* Proof of the consistency of truth-functional propositional logic (Emil Post 1920)
* Proof of the semantic completeness of truth-functional propositional logic (Paul Bernays 1918), (Emil Post 1920)
* Proof of the syntactic completeness of truth-functional propositional logic (Emil Post 1920)
* Proof of the decidability of truth-functional propositional logic (Emil Post 1920)
* Proof of the consistency of first-order monadic predicate logic (Leopold Löwenheim 1915)
* Proof of the semantic completeness of first-order monadic predicate logic (Leopold Löwenheim 1915)
* Proof of the decidability of first-order monadic predicate logic (Leopold Löwenheim 1915)
* Proof of the consistency of first-order predicate logic (David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann 1928)
* Proof of the semantic completeness of first-order predicate logic (Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem 1930)
* Proof of the cut-elimination theorem for the sequent calculus (Gentzen&#x27;s &quot;Hauptsatz&quot; 1934)
* Proof of the undecidability of first-order predicate logic (Church&#x27;s theorem 1936)
* Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem 1931
* Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem 1931
* Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem (Gödel and Tarski in the 1930s)
