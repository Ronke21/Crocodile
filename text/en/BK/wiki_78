<text>Acton (population 9,376 in 2021) is a community located in the town of Halton Hills, in Halton Region, Ontario, Canada. At the northern end of the Region, it is on the outer edge of the Greater Toronto Area and is one of two of the primary population centres of the Town; the other is Georgetown. From 1842 until 1986, the town was a major centre for the tanning and leather goods industry. In the early years, it was often referred to as &quot;Leathertown&quot;.

==History==
In 1825, the area now known as Acton was settled by the Rev. Ezra, Rev. Zenas, and Rufus Adams. These men were Methodist preachers who took a sabbatical and began farming here on a branch of the Credit River. A fourth brother, Eliphalet, also settled here later. In the 1840s, the community had a grist mill and tannery. The community was initially named Danville when settler Wheeler Green opened a dry-goods store in 1828. It was later called Adamsville, after the three original settlers. In 1844, postmaster Robert Swan named the village Acton after the area of Acton, London, in England.

When the Mississaugas still had their reserve at Port Credit in the 19th century, they would come up to Acton every spring to tap the sugar bush just south of the village.

In 1856, the Grand Trunk Railway arrived and helped spur growth in the area, especially along Mill Street. By 1869, Acton had businesses that included woodworking mills, tanneries, glove makers and carriage works. Originally part of Esquesing Township, Acton&#x27;s principal trade was in grain, lumber, cordwood, leather and hops.

The village would acquire a local newspaper in 1875, when &quot;The Acton Free Press&quot; was established. It continued to publish until its closure in 1984.

===Evolution===
Under a bylaw passed by the Halton County Council in September 1873, it was incorporated as a village in 1874, and erected into a town in 1950. A new town hall was opened in 1883 (later designated as a Heritage Building in 1996).

Since its formation, the boundaries were expanded in several stages over the years prior to its amalgamation in 1974:

* The first effort was in 1918, when an application was made to annex of parkland and housing lots adjoining Fairy Lake, along with consting of the Crescent subdivision and the lands occupied by the Acton Tanning Company. Only the first parcel of land was approved for annexation, but it helped to resolve some anomalies among the affected properties.
* The Crescent subdivision was annexed at the beginning of 1949.
* In March 1955, the new Town increased in size from to , through the annexation of the industrial lands occupied by Beardmore and the Wool Combing Corporation, together with farmland that would later be developed into the Glenlea and Lakeview subdivisions.
* of industrial land north of the Town limits was annexed in September 1958.
* of land to the south and west of the Fairview Cemetery, and south of Cobble Hill Road (then known as Queen Street), was annexed in 1968 for residential development.

===Leather industry===
Tanning has been an important industry in Acton since 1842, when the first tannery was established by Abraham Nelles, as the area was attractive to the leather industry because of the large numbers of hemlock and spruce trees. These provided the tannin required for a firm, high quality leather of a reddish colour.

A number of subsequent owners operated the tannery business, before the Beardmore family purchased it in 1865, running it for over 50 years. At one time, it was the largest tanner in Canada.

The Beardmores also opened tanneries in other parts of southern Ontario. From 1877 to 1922, they operated another large facility in Bracebridge, having been attracted by the area&#x27;s large supply of hemlock. It closed due to the decline of American markets around 1920.

By 1889, their main tanneries in Acton were very large, with a combined floor space of almost . They also built a large brick warehouse that year beside the railway tracks. Hides arrived by rail and were taken for processing by horse-drawn wagons and then shipped by rail to customers.

The Beardmore tannery was successfully sued for wrongful death in 1899, after an employee died in 1897 from anthrax poisoning arising from the handling of infected hides.

In 1944, the tannery was sold to Canada Packers who ran it until its closure in 1986.

In March 1946, a breach in the tannery&#x27;s filter dam lead to the release of of waste water and debris, which flooded the village water supply and caused extensive property damage downstream as far as Limehouse and Stewarttown.

In 1980, three investors decided to transform the tannery&#x27;s warehouse into the Old Hide House, a retail store with leather clothing, goods and furniture. From 1980 to 1993, the Old Hide House also housed a restaurant, Jack Tanner&#x27;s Table. It was famous for its commercial slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s worth the drive to Acton!&quot; The business was interrupted at times because of bankruptcy and other reasons, and was finally closed in late 2024.

Other specialty tanners and leather products manufacturers were also established in the town. These included Hewetson Shoe, Coronna Shoe, Superior Glove, Marzo Glove and Frank Heller and Co. In the early 20th century, Acton was the main urban community of Esquesing Township, much larger than nearby Georgetown, Ontario which now has four times the population.

Because of the extensive tanning industry that was located in the area during the 19th century and early 20th century, the area has earned the nickname of &quot;Leathertown&quot;.

===Passenger transport===
GO Transit provides bus and train service on its Kitchener corridor, with a stop at Acton GO Station.

The Grand Trunk brought trains to the area in 1856, and its station was next to the Beardmore leather warehouse. Canadian National closed the station in November 1967, (although the agent would stay until 1968) and later applied to formally cease service, which was not heard by the Canadian Transport Commission until January 1970. The Commission refused the application in October 1970, ordering the then minimal operation to continue. CN, together with Gray Coach Lines, would later add an additional train/bus line in April 1971. While the service remained, the station was disposed in 1973 and replaced with a shelter for the GO Bus service between Guelph and Toronto. CN would cease picking up area passengers in November 1975.

GO Trains would begin stopping in Acton in October 1990, but were later suspended in July 1993 because of budget cuts. The service later resumed in January 2013.

Bus service first appeared in April 1926, when Toronto, Kitchener and London Coach Lines began operating a route between Kitchener and Toronto. Following TKL&#x27;s bankruptcy in January 1927, the route was taken over by Arrow Coach Lines.

Arrow was acquired by Gray Coach in May 1937, which continued to operate buses through Acton until GO Transit took over in February 1976.

From 1917 to 1931, Acton was also served by the Toronto Suburban Railway, which early on entered into a notable dispute with the Beardmore tannery over a crossing with a Grand Trunk spur line in the town, that went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada for resolution.

===Identity===
====Permission to use arms====
In 1926, with the help of Sir Harry Brittain, the Village of Acton was given permission by the Municipal Borough of Acton in Middlesex, England, to adopt a variant of the latter&#x27;s coat of arms.

The arms were more particularly described as follows (substituting &quot;Canadian sugar maple&quot; for &quot;oak&quot;, as the case may be):

*ARMS: Gules an Oak Tree issuant from a Mount in base proper on a Chief Or between to the dexter an open Book and the sinister a Cog-Wheel both proper a Pale of the first charged with three Seaxes fessewise in pale proper pommelled and hilted Or points to the sinister and cutting edge upwards in chief a Saxon Crown of the last.
*CREST: Issuant from a Mural Crown Or a Sprig of Oak fructed proper.
*MOTTO: &quot;Floreat Actona&quot; - .

The municipal council continued to use it until 1974, when Acton amalgamated with the Town of Georgetown and most of the Township of Esquesing to form the Town of Halton Hills.

====Actonite or Actonian====
In older books and papers of the area, two demonyms have existed for residents of the area at the same time. &quot;Actonite&quot; was used to identify people who moved to the area, and &quot;Actonian&quot; referred to people who grew up there. The first designation now predominates, due to the influx of new residents in the 1960s, but older residents still remember it.

==Geography==
Acton is located at the intersection of and . 

The town&#x27;s location was chosen because of the good source of water power from the Black Creek, and the flour mill established at the beginning is still in operation today, as part of Parrish &amp; Heimbecker. It is also near the watershed between the Credit River and the Grand River which is just west of the urban area, where the Blue Springs Creek begins. Acton also has Fairy Lake at Prospect Park, which is the fairgrounds for the Acton Fall Fair every September.

There was once a moraine south of Fairy Lake called Cobble Hill (for a time also known as Mount Campbell), which was high enough to afford panoramic views that were appreciated by local photographers. A gravel pit was established on it in the 19th century, and the top of the hill was lopped off in two stages: first to form a dam for one of the tannery&#x27;s filtering beds, and secondly for helping to level off sections of road during the construction of Highway 25 in 1949.

<doc id="388752" wikidata="Q2138816" url="?curid=388752" title="Regular Masonic jurisdiction">
<text>In Freemasonry, regularity is one of the factors by which individual Grand Lodges judge whether to recognise one another for the purposes of allowing formal interaction at the Grand Lodge level and visitation by members of other jurisdictions. Each individual Grand Lodge determines which other Grand Lodges it considers Regular (and the standards for determining this are not uniform between Grand Lodges).

==Regularity and its origins==

===History===

There are a number of groupings of Masonic jurisdictions which consider themselves regular, and recognise others as regular, yet consider others to be irregular. There is no globally centralised Masonic organisational system, and therefore the criteria for regularity are not consistent across all Grand Lodges.

====Ancients and Moderns====
The concept of &quot;Regularity&quot; first appears in Payne&#x27;s regulations, and was printed in Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Constitutions&quot;. In regulation VIII we find –
* If any Set or Number of Masons shall take upon themselves to form a Lodge without the Grand-Master&#x27;s Warrant, the regular Lodges are not to countenance them, or own them as fair Brethren and duly form’d, nor approve of their Acts and Deeds; but must treat them as Rebels, until they humble themselves, as the Grand-Master shall in his Prudence direct, and until he approve of them by his Warrant, which must be signify’d to the other Lodges, as the Custom is when a new Lodge is to be register’d in the List of Lodges.

The revisions published in the 1738 constitutions introduced the term &quot;Regular Lodge&quot;.

Arguments regarding what ought to constitute &quot;proper&quot; Freemasonry appear in the 1720s, when some lodges of the Premier Grand Lodge of England began to replace the old method of drawing the lodge symbols on the floor in chalk and charcoal with tape, tacked to the floor, and portable metal letters. This earned the new Grand Lodge the nickname of the &quot;Moderns&quot;. In 1735, the same Grand Lodge refused admission to the master and wardens of an Irish lodge, who claimed to be a deputation from the Grand Master of Ireland, unless they accepted the English constitution, which they refused. In 1751 the nucleus of a second Grand Lodge, which did not accept the innovations of the original, was formed. Their book of constitutions, the &quot;Ahiman Rezon&quot; of their Grand Secretary Laurence Dermott, suggests that the Moderns had now changed their passwords in alarm over masonic exposures printed in the 1730s, which would not allow their members admission into any lodges outside their own jurisdiction. The process of uniting of these two Grand Lodges began in 1809, when the Moderns set up a travelling &quot;Lodge of Promulgation&quot; to return their ritual to its &quot;Ancient&quot; form. This made possible the creation, in 1813, of the United Grand Lodge of England.

====Landmarks of Freemasonry====

Payne&#x27;s 1720 regulations mention the necessity of maintaining the &quot;old Land-Marks&quot; of the order, but it was much later that anybody attempted to define them. It was not until 1858 that Albert Mackey published a list of 25 landmarks, which while not universally accepted, formed the basis of some American jurisdictions.

Attempts to formulate the basis of regularity came even later in England, and appear to have arisen from recognition of a new Grand Lodge in France, which had just split from the Grand Orient de France, already branded as irregular (see below). A letter of 1913 from the new Grand Master of the Independent and Regular National Grand Lodge of France and of the French Colonies stated the obligations of his lodges as his claim to regularity.
# While the Lodge is at work the Bible will always be open on the altar.
# The ceremonies will be conducted in strict conformity with the Ritual of the &quot;Regime Rectifié&quot; which is followed by these Lodges, a Ritual which was drawn up in 1778 and sanctioned in 1782, and with which the Duke of Kent was initiated in 1792[47].
# The Lodge will always be opened and closed with invocation and in the name of the Great Architect of the Universe. All the summonses of the Order and of the Lodges will be printed with the symbols of the Great Architect of the Universe.
# No religious or political discussion will be permitted in the Lodge.
# The Lodge as such will never take part officially in any political affair but every individual Brother will preserve complete liberty of opinion and action.
# Only those Brethren who are recognised as true Brethren by the Grand Lodge of England will be received in Lodge.

These appear to have formed the basis for the 1929 &quot;Basic Principles for Grand Lodge Recognition&quot;, still used by the United Grand Lodge of England.

====Great Architect of the Universe====
In 1813, upon the union of Antients and Moderns, the UGLE had created a new Constitution, based on the &quot;Constitutions&quot; of Anderson of the &quot;Moderns&quot; and the &quot;Ahiman Rezon&quot; of the &quot;Antients&quot;, which required 
acceptance of the Great Architect of the Universe.

The Grand Orient de France (GOdF) initially adapted its Constitution in order to comply. In 1877, however, on a proposal of the Protestant priest Frédéric Desmons at the convention of the GOdF, the members of the convention removed references to the Great Architect of the Universe (GAOTU) from their Constitution. They saw their decision as a way to return to the original Constitution of James Anderson of 1723. The first two sentences of the constitution of the GOdF (in English translation) had been:
:&quot;Its principles of Freemasonry are the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and human solidarity. It considers liberty of conscience as an inherent right of each man and excludes no one because of his beliefs.&quot;
These became:
:&quot;Its principles are liberty of conscience and human solidarity. It excludes no one because of his beliefs.&quot;

This decision led to a schism between the Grand Orient de France and the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE). 
Since the great schism of 1877 freemasonry is divided in two branches, &quot;Continental&quot; style Freemasonry and &quot;Anglo&quot; Freemasonry. These two branches are not in mutual regular amity, since most English style lodges consider Continental style lodges to be irregular. The Grand Orient de France (Grand Orients) and the United Grand Lodge of England (Grand Lodges) are the basic models for each variety of freemasonry.

===Present===

====Home Grand Lodges – related jurisdictions====
The largest collection of mutually recognised Grand Lodges derives its regularity from one or more of the Home Grand Lodges (United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), Grand Lodge of Scotland (GLoS) and Grand Lodge of Ireland (GLoI)) based on criteria known as &quot;Basic Principles for Grand Lodge Recognition&quot; which together they codified and published on 4 September 1929 (although not new – they had been developed and refined over at least the preceding 150 years):

# Regularity of origin; i.e.each Grand Lodge shall have been established lawfully by a duly recognised Grand Lodge or by three or more regularly constituted Lodges.
# That a belief in the G.A.O.T.U. and His revealed will shall be an essential qualification for membership.
# That all Initiates shall take their Obligation on or in full view of an open Volume of Sacred Law, by which is meant the revelation from above which is binding on the conscience of the particular individual who is being initiated.
# That the membership of the Grand Lodge and individual Lodges shall be composed exclusively of men; and that each Grand Lodge shall have no Masonic intercourse of any kind with mixed Lodges or bodies which admit women to membership.
# That the Grand Lodge shall have sovereign jurisdiction over Lodges under its control; i.e. that it shall be a responsible, independent, self-governing organisation, with sole and undisputed authority over the Craft or Symbolic Degrees (Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason) within its Jurisdiction; and shall not in any way be subject to, or divide such authority with, a Supreme Council or other Power claiming any control or supervision over those degrees.
# That the three Great Lights of Freemasonry (namely, a Volume of Sacred Law, the Square, and the Compasses) shall always be exhibited when the Grand Lodge or its subordinate Lodges are at work, the chief of these being the Volume of Sacred Law.
# That the discussion of religion and politics within the Lodge shall be strictly prohibited.
# That the principles of the Antient Landmarks, customs, and usages of the Craft be strictly observed.

The first attempt to codify the governance of Freemasonry was The Constitution of the Freemasons of Strasbourg in 1459, which the Masonic Bodies of Continental Freemasonry hold as the essence of Freemasonry. However, the more popular codification in English - speaking nations was created by James Anderson in his &quot;Constitutions&quot;, published in 1723, which contain his idea of the basic principles. Dr. Albert Mackey built on this in 1856, when he identified 25 Landmarks or characteristics of Masonry which have been widely adopted in America.

UGLE considers itself to be the most ancient Grand Lodge in continuous existence. Although it was founded in 1813 with its first Grand Master, it considers itself a continuation of the much older Grand Lodge of London, founded in 1717 by four pre-existent lodges. No record exists of any earlier Lodge organisation styling itself as a Grand Lodge. Three of the four original lodges still exist. Today they are UGLE lodges No 2, No 4, and No 12. Naturally, since they were founded even before the creation of the Grand Lodge of London, they function without the normal warrant, and also have some internal offices and regulations which differ from the standard UGLE constitutions. As they pre-date the foundation of the oldest grand lodge, and as their actual date of foundation is unknown, these three lodges are referred to as being &quot;time immemorial&quot; lodges. Since 1717 other grand lodges have been founded, and many have sought recognition by UGLE, hence it has claimed the &#x27;benchmark&#x27; of masonic regularity.

====&quot;Continental&quot; style jurisdictions====
The Continental style Grand Lodges and Grand Orients have created several organizations in order to organize their international relations, such as CLIPSAS, the International Masonic Union Catena, CIMAS, COMAM, TRACIA and, formerly, the International Secretariat of the Masonic Adogmatic Powers before it was re-absorbed into CLIPSAS.

Other bodies predicate their assessment of regularity on the 8th decree of Anderson&#x27;s Constitution; a Lodge is regular if it works in conformity to the rules of its granted constitutional patent. Grand Lodges certify regularity to their recognized Member Lodges and Grand Lodges with patents.

==Europe==

===Austria===
The first Grand Lodge in Austria, the Große Landesloge von Österreich was founded in Vienna in 1784 but only ten years later in 1794 Freemasonry was forbidden by the then Holy Roman Emperor Franz II. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 Freemasonry was re-established, but only in the Hungarian part of the Empire. After the end of World War I, only four weeks after the proclamation of the Republic of German-Austria the Grand Lodge of Vienna was founded on 8 December 1918. She was recognised by UGLE in 1930. Immediately after the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany in 1938 Freemasonry was again forbidden. After the end of World War II the Grand Lodge of Vienna was formally re-established on 4 August 1945. In 1952 UGLE restored relations with her. 1955 after the end of the Allied occupation of Austria the Grandlodge changed its name into Grand Lodge of Austria.

The Grand Lodge of Austria has currently 77 lodges with approx. 3500 brethren.

===Belgium===
Several Grand Lodges are active in Belgium.

The Regular Grand Lodge of Belgium (R.G.L.B.) is currently the only Belgian Grand Lodge which is recognised as regular by UGLE and its concordant jurisdictions.

The oldest Grand Lodge of Belgium, the Grand Orient of Belgium (G.O.B.) lost its recognition by the UGLE in the 19th century when it decided to remove the requirement for Masons to have a belief in a Supreme Being. In an attempt to regain recognition by the UGLE, five lodges from the GOB founded the Grand Lodge of Belgium (G.L.B.) in 1959. When in 1979 the G.L.B. also lost its recognition by UGLE, nine lodges founded the Regular Grand Loge of Belgium on 15 June 1979.

===Bulgaria===

The oldest obedience in Bulgaria is the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Bulgaria, established in 1917. Until it was banned in 1940 by a Nazi Law called &quot;Law of the Homeland protection&quot; this Grand Lodge was recognized by 47 regular and mainstream Grand Lodges worldwide. Most of the recognitions were never withdrawn and after Grand Lodge of Bulgaria (GLB) was reactivated it gained additional recognitions. Today GLB is recognized by 54 Grand Lodges from Europe, North and South America and Africa. It works in the Antient &amp; Accepted Scottish Rite, has 16 Constituent lodges including one English speaking Lodge &quot;HIRAM&quot;.

===Ireland===
Regular Freemasonry in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland is controlled by the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which is based in Dublin. It has jurisdiction over 13 Provincial Grand Lodges covering all the Freemasons of the island of Ireland, and another 12 provinces worldwide.

=== France ===
In 2021 they were 38 Grand Lodges operating in France including overseas territories.
They range from 200 to 60,000 members.

The Grande Loge Nationale Française (GLNF) is the only French Grand Lodge to be recognised as regular by UGLE and its concordant jurisdictions.

The Grand Orient de France (GOdF) was recognised by most Grand Lodges in the world until the middle of the 19th century, when the GOdF recognized the Supreme Council of Louisiana. This caused several US Grand Lodges to withdraw recognition from the GOdF. The final breaking point, however, came about due to a decision by the GOdF in 1877 to remove the requirement for Masons to have a belief in a Supreme Being. UGLE and most other Anglo-Saxon Grand Lodges suspended all relations with, and recognition of, the Grand Orient de France as a result.

===Germany===
The Vereinigte Großlogen von Deutschland or United Grand Lodges of Germany (VGLvD) is the regular Grand Lodge in Germany, it comprises five united Grand Lodges of varying traditions: two traditional German Grand Lodges, one Prussian Swedish Rite Grand Lodge, one English tradition Grand Lodge and one North American tradition Grand Lodge, the latter two Grand Lodges having been formed by occupying forces.

There are also irregular masonic Grand Lodges in Germany including Women Freemasons (FGLD) as well as Co-Freemasons.

===Italy===
There are no fewer than three national Grand Lodges operating in Italy.

The Grand Regular Italian Lodge and the Grand Orient of Italy are regular obediences recognized by United Grand Lodge of England.

Portugal

In Portugal the Grand Lodge is called Grande Loja Legal de Portugal (GLLP/GLRP).

The Grand Lodge of Portugal (GLLP / GLRP) is a regular Portuguese Masonic obedience. GLLP and the Regular Grand Lodge of Portugal vied for the leadership of regular Portuguese Masonry until their reconciliation in 2011, the second was officially recognized by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE).

===Slovakia===
In Slovakia is a Grand Lodge that called Veľká lóža Slovenska (Great Lodge of Slovakia) .

===United Kingdom===
Masonic activity in the United Kingdom is governed by three bodies which are independent from each other. The United Grand Lodge of England has jurisdiction over Freemasonry in England, Wales, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man (&quot;English Constitution&quot; – &quot;EC&quot;), the Grand Lodge of Scotland over Freemasonry in Scotland (&quot;Scottish Constitution&quot; – &quot;SC&quot;), and the Grand Lodge of Ireland over Freemasonry in Ireland (&quot;Irish Constitution&quot; – &quot;IC&quot;).

Because of the historical role of the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) in the development of Freemasonry, the term &quot;Regular Freemasonry&quot;, when it is not further defined, usually refers to the United Grand Lodge of England and its recognized jurisdictions. Since UGLE is considered to be not only the oldest, but also the largest grouping of lodges, UGLE recognition (or the lack thereof) is generally the barometer by which a Masonic jurisdiction is deemed regular. UGLE provides a list of recognised Grand Lodges on its website.

==North America==

===Canada===
The majority of Canadian Grand Lodges are in amity with UGLE. There is also a healthy presence of GOdF-affiliated Grand Lodges and Orients that follow Continental Freemasonry, particularly in the French-speaking province of Quebec.

===United States===
In the United States, each state has a Grand Lodge that supervises the lodges within that state and is sovereign and independent within that jurisdiction. These are commonly referred to as the &quot;regular&quot; or &quot;mainstream&quot; Grand Lodges. There is no national Grand Lodge. All regular Grand Lodges in the US are in mutual amity with each other and with UGLE.

Because of historical segregation, many states also have a sovereign and independent Prince Hall Grand Lodge that is predominantly African-American. For many years the mainstream Grand Lodges did not recognize Prince Hall Freemasonry and considered their Prince Hall Freemasonry irregular, despite the UGLE&#x27;s approval of their regularity. In the 1980s, many mainstream Grand Lodges began to recognize Prince Hall Grand Lodges as Freemasons.

Due to a 19th-century argument and a resulting schism, not all Prince Hall Grand Lodges recognize each other (see Prince Hall National Grand Lodge), and generally the mainstream Grand Lodges have followed the lead of their Prince Hall counterparts when it comes to recognizing Prince Hall Grand Lodges in other states.

Throughout the US there are also numerous independent Masonic Lodges and Grand Lodges, which are not recognized as such by UGLE, the mainstream Grand Lodges, or their Prince Hall counterparts. Many of these are affiliated with international organizations of Continental Freemasonry. These are deemed to be irregular by UGLE - affiliated Masonic Obediences.

=== Mexico ===
The regularity of Masonic lodges in Mexico is a topic of considerable controversy, primarily due to the prevalence of irregular lodges compared to regular ones. This discrepancy has sparked ongoing debates within the Masonic community in Mexico.

Among the numerous Masonic bodies in the country, one notable exception stands out: The York Grand Lodge of Mexico. Established in 1865, it holds the distinction of being the sole Grand Lodge with federal character in Mexico. Since its inception, The York Grand Lodge of Mexico has maintained consistent recognition from the United Grand Lodge of England, a recognition that persists to the present day.

This unique status underscores the significance of The York Grand Lodge of Mexico within the broader context of Mexican Freemasonry, serving as a beacon of regularity amid the complexities of the Masonic landscape in the country.

==South America==

===Chile===

The Only regular regular Masonic body in Chile is the Grand Lodge of Chile, founded on May 24, 1862 in Valparaíso. The earthquake of 1906 destroyed the original headquarters and the archives of the Grand Lodge, which determined its definitive transfer to Santiago, settling in the Club de la República, located in 659 Marcoleta street.

In 1862, the Grand Lodge of Chile was recognized by the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, that is, the same year it was founded, and the following year it would obtain recognition from the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia.

In 1864, when the problems caused by Napoleon III in French Freemasonry had already been overcome, official recognition was obtained by the Central Grand Orient de France. By 1862, the first Constitution was promulgated under the name of Statutes of the Masonic Order in Chile.

The Grand Lodge of Chile has jurisdiction over the symbolic lodges (they work in the degrees of apprentice, fellow craft and Master Mason), these can work three different rites: Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, York Rite and Schröder Rite. His currently Grand Master is W. Bro. Sebastián Jans, since 2018.

Chile has a Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite, with jurisdiction over 4 to 33 degree too, was foundes on 1870 and reactivated on 1899, with Eduardo de la Barra as his first Sovereign Grand Commander

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are several regular Lodges that depend on other regular Masonic bodies, such as Harmony Lodge 1411 (based in Valparaiso, dependent on the District Grand Lodge of South America, southern division of the United Grand Lodge of England), Britannia Lodge 1033 (located in Santiago, Grand Lodge of Scotland) Bethesda and Huelen Lodges (dependent on American Freemasonry)

<text>Prime95, also distributed as the command-line utility mprime for FreeBSD and Linux, is a freeware application written by George Woltman. It is the official client of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS), a volunteer computing project dedicated to searching for Mersenne primes. It is also used in overclocking to test for system stability.

Although most of its source code is available, Prime95 is not free and open-source software because its end-user license agreement states that if the software is used to find a prime qualifying for a bounty offered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, then that bounty will be claimed and distributed by GIMPS.

==Finding Mersenne primes by volunteer computing==
Prime95 tests numbers for primality using the Fermat primality test (referred to internally as PRP, or &quot;probable prime&quot;). For much of its history, it used the Lucas–Lehmer primality test, but the availability of Lucas–Lehmer assignments was deprecated in April 2021 to increase search throughput. Specifically, to guard against faulty results, every Lucas–Lehmer test had to be performed twice in its entirety, while Fermat tests can be verified in a small fraction of their original run time using a proof generated during the test by Prime95. Current versions of Prime95 remain capable of Lucas–Lehmer testing for the purpose of double-checking existing Lucas–Lehmer results, and for fully verifying &quot;probably prime&quot; Fermat test results (which, unlike &quot;prime&quot; Lucas–Lehmer results, are not conclusive).

To reduce the number of full-length primality tests needed, Prime95 first checks numbers for trivial compositeness by attempting to find a small factor. As of 2024, test candidates are mainly filtered using Pollard&#x27;s p – 1 algorithm. Trial division is implemented, but Prime95 is rarely used for that work in practice because it can be done much more efficiently using a GPU, due to the type of arithmetic involved. Finally, the elliptic-curve factorization method and Williams&#x27;s p + 1 algorithm are implemented, but are considered not useful at modern GIMPS testing levels and mostly used in attempts to factor much smaller Mersenne numbers that have already undergone primality testing.

GIMPS has discovered 18 new Mersenne primes since its foundation in 1996, the first 17 of which using Prime95. The 18th and most recent, M136279841, was discovered in October 2024 using an Nvidia GPU, being the first GIMPS discovery to not have used Prime95 and its CPU computation. 15 of the 17 primes discovered with Prime95 were the largest known prime number at the time of their respective discoveries, the exceptions being M37156667 and M42643801, which were discovered out of order from the larger M43112609.

== Use for stress testing ==

To maximize search throughput, most of Prime95 is written in hand-tuned assembly, which makes its system resource usage much greater than most other computer programs. Additionally, due to the high precision requirements of primality testing, the program is very sensitive to computation errors and proactively reports them. These factors make it a commonly used tool among overclockers to check the stability of a particular configuration.

<text>Nampo (North Korean official spelling: Nampho; ), also spelled Nampo, is a major city in North Korea which is the country&#x27;s fourth-largest by population. The city is an important seaport in the country as it lies on the northern shore of the Taedong River estuary, 15 km east of the estuary&#x27;s mouth. Formerly known as Chinnampo, it was a provincial-level &quot;Directly Governed City&quot; (&quot;Chikhalsi&quot;) from 1980 to 2004, and was designated a &quot;Special City&quot; (&quot;T&#x27;ŭkpyŏlsi&quot;, 특별시; 特別市) in 2010. Nampo is approximately 50 km southwest of Pyongyang, at the mouth of the Taedong River. Since North Korean independence, the city has developed a wide range of industry and has seen significant recent redevelopment.

== History ==

=== Before formation of North Korea ===
The city belonged to Gojoseon until the Three Kingdoms era, when it was taken by Goguryeo. During this time, the city was part of Sogyong (now Pyongyang) until the Goryeo dynasty, when in the aftermath of the Myocheong rebellion, Sogyong was split into six counties, of which currently constitute Nampo are Kangso-hyon, Ryonggang-hyon and Samhwa-hyon. In the late Goryeo period, the area was named Chungnampo for the village of Pogu, located to the south of Chungsan County. After the establishment of Joseon dynsasty, the area belonged to Pyongan Province.
The name of the city comes from the fishing village that was originally located in the Samhwa-hyon area of South Pyongan Province. The city was renamed to Chinnampo during the Japanese occupation of Korea, by adding the character &#x27;鎭&#x27; as during the First Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese landed in Nampo and defeated the Qing dynasty forces. The name was immediately reverted to Nampo after liberation to be rid of colonial legacies.
=== After formation of North Korea ===
The city was founded in 1950 and contained 27 &quot;ri&quot;. Various rearrangements occurred in 1952 and by 1960, there were 15 &quot;dong&quot; and 8 &quot;ri&quot;.

In December 1979, Nampo became a directly-governed city. Taean-si, Ryonggang-gun were absorbed into Nampo and the former Nampo-si was reorganised into Nampo-guyok with jurisdiction over 26 &quot;dong&quot;s.

In 1983, a major reorganisation occurred and Nampo-guyok was split up into Waudo-guyok and Hanggu-guyok while Taean-si was split into Chollima-guyok, Taean-guyok and Kangso-guyok.

On 9 January 2004, the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly downgraded Nampo from a directly governed city (&quot;chikhalsi&quot;) to a normal city belonging to South Pyongan Province. For some time after this, Chollima-guyok, Kangso-guyok and Taean-guyok districts became counties (&quot;gun)&quot; of South Pyongan Province. By 2012, these counties were re-promoted to districts.

In 2010, the city was detached from South Pyongan Province, and the counties which were originally part of the city reassigned to it along with transferring administration of Onchon-gun to Nampo. Due to these changes, Nampo became the second largest city in North Korea. 

In September 2020, a major uplifting of the city was completed, in accordance to the state policy of &#x27;building local cities into distinctive towns&#x27;. This resulted in a seaside theme, with buildings mainly remodelled in blue, but also orange and browns. The strong local glass industry produced windows to glaze the apartment buildings. The supply of electricity, water and public transport was improved. As previously, the water supply was quoted to be &#x27;insufficient&#x27; due to &#x27;topographical conditions&#x27;.

== Economy ==
Nampo was originally a small fishing village that became a port for foreign trade in 1897, developing into a modern port in 1945 after World War II. With the rapid increase in state investment, the city&#x27;s industrial capacity grew. Some of the city&#x27;s industrial facilities include the city&#x27;s Smelter Complex, Glass Corporation, Shipbuilding complex, Fishery Complex, and other central and local factories. Nampo is a center for the DPRK shipbuilding industry. North of the city are facilities for freight transportation, aquatic products, and fishery, and a sea salt factory. Apples grown in the city&#x27;s Ryonggang county (룡강군) are a famous local product.

In a May 1981, Kim Il Sung drew up a plan for the city which included three goals:

* to be developed into an international port city
* to increase export volume and be developed into the largest trading port in the DPRK
* to develop into the largest industrial area in the west of North Korea and to have a focus on heavy industry

=== Farming ===
As the city is located on the Taedong River, the surrounding area is well suited to agriculture. Land reclamation occurs along the river and is used for rice growing. Before liberation, the economy was mainly agricultural at 97%, but was in a very backwards condition. This was made worse by the Japanese plundering the rice grown locally. After the foundation of North Korea, the conditions rapidly improved and it was transformed into a modern rural economy and fishery industry.

47.8% of the agricultural land are paddy fields, 40% are fields, 8.7% are orchards and 2.7% are Mulberry fields. The majority of fields sown are for grains, while around 20% is for vegetables. Various livestock are grown on cooperative farms, but also in private farms. The fishery industry in Nampo is one of the most important on the west coast.

=== Health ===
The main hospital in Nampo is the Nampho City People&#x27;s Hospital, which underwent major reconstruction in 2020. The new hospital is reported to greatly enhance the quality of medical services provided by the hospital. It has a telemedicine link to hospitals in Pyongyang to further improve the medical care provided.

Other treatment facilities in the city include the Nampho City Koryo Medicine Hospital, Nampho City Maternity Hospital and the Waudo District People&#x27;s Hospital. 

=== Industry ===
Prior to liberation, the industry was fully committed to military needs to supply the Japanese imperialist ambition and was an important port for munitions transport. For convenience, the Japanese-built industries were clustered around what are now the districts of Waudo-guyok and Hunggu-guyok. Since then, Nampo has developed a strong economy with some industries in these areas being demolished and rebuilt in the corridor from Nampo to Pyongyang, such as in Chollima-guyok, Kangso-guyok or Taean-guyok.

The Nampo Smelting Complex is a key production complex and produces various copper products. It also smelts zinc and lead, although the zinc smelter was allegedly dismantled in 2001 due to pollution concerns. Four other important industries of the city are the Chollima Steel Complex, Taean Friendship Glass Factory, Kumsong Tractor Factory and Taean Heavy Machine Complex. Although the city also has a range of light industry, the major companies are all invested in various forms of heavy industry.

The position of the city has attracted foreign investment, an example being Pyeonghwa Motors, which was a joint venture between the Unification Church and the North Korean government, where about 340 workers built cars from knock-down kits, mainly various Chinese cars and Fiats. 

==== Defence ====
Nampo has an extensive shipbuilding capability, which along with cargo ships, also builds various warships. A submersible submarine-launched ballistic missile launch platform is based out of Nampo. The platform was first observed in 2017 and was likely operational in 2019, although in 2020 the platform was captured out of the water, possibly for repairs, as at the same time, the first platform in the Sinpho South Shipyard also underwent repairs.

A number of Hainan (Taechong) class patrol vessels, Osa (Soju)-class missile boats, Nongo class fast attack crafts, Komar-class missile boats, Nampo-class corvettes and a Najin-class frigate are based in Nampo.

==== Alleged uranium enrichment facility ====
In 2018, a report in &quot;The Diplomat&quot; claimed to have uncovered a Uranium enrichment facility in Chollima-guyok. A large building is said to contain the centrifuges for isotope separation and is surrounded by a wall, which according to the report, is a sign of a high security facility. The lack of snow on the roof of the building suggest that heat is being produced the entire year, and thus suggested that it is likely to be a uranium enrichment site. 

However, these features are common in North Korea, and buildings with security fencing, on-site housing and monuments to the Kim family and are not proof of a uranium enrichment facility. The Korean People&#x27;s Army brigades that were assigned to the nuclear program are fixed, unlike the shock troops deployed for hydroelectric power station or apartment construction and if they were moved to Nampo, there should be evident signs in satellite imagery, of which there were none. Similarly, the security at the facility is comparably low, being accessed on an open road off the Youth Hero Motorway and with few facilities for security personal onsite. In comparison, the nearby Chamjin Missile Factory (Tae-sung Machine Plant) has noticeably higher security; an actual enrichment facility at the Nyongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center has multiple gates and inspection posts and is in a significantly less exposed position.

==Administrative divisions==
Nampo is divided into 5 g&quot;uyŏk&quot; and 2 g&quot;un&quot;, which are in turn subdivided into &quot;dong&quot; and &quot;ri&quot;:
== Demographics ==
According to the 2008 North Korea Census, a population of 366,815 lived in the city, of which 310,864 lived in urban areas and 55,951 lived in rural areas.

==Environment==

=== Climate ===
=== Geography ===

Nampo is located on the west coast of Korea, and is mostly low-lying with 82% of the city below 50 metres elevation. There are mountains mostly in the south and east, which are generally below 100 metres above sea level, forming a wavy plain. The highest points in the city are on the Osok mountain range, with Osok-san at 566 m and Guksabong at 506 m. The many rivers and streams flowing through the city provide good conditions for agriculture. Underneath the city, there are iron, manganese, titanium along with other precious metals, including gold and silver.

=== Natural environment ===
Around 5,000 birds visit the Kumsong tideland and 76,000 waterbirds visit the lake created by the West Sea Barrage, which includes a number of endangered and vulnerable birds. 

==Transportation==
===Road===
The Youth Hero Motorway, completed in October 2000 connects Nampo to Pyongyang. The motorway was built mainly by younger people, and hence the road was renamed in commemoration of their efforts from Pyongyang-Nampo Motorway to the Youth Hero Motorway. 

==== Public transport ====
Nampo has a trolleybus system which opened around 1982. The system has a main line, running from Nampo Stadium to the northeast of the city and a branch from the main line to the west of the city, near the salt pans. The branch could be only served from the direction of the stadium, and was in poor condition with the overhead line no longer stretched with it not being used at least since 2011. In 2015, the service was reported intermittently operated if at all, and only on weekdays. Operation was returned to normal from 24 August 2021, when the city authorities declared a push to improve transport, which included normalising the trolleybus service. As part of this push, around 20 derelict buses were repaired and brought back into service. 

In November 2015, a solar panel electric bus developed by the science and technological committee of Nampo was tested in the city. It is powered by 32 100-watt solar panels charging 50 Taedonggang Batteries and powering a 95 kW DC motor to carry up to 140 passengers at 40 km/h and is part of the effort to alleviate the energy shortages in North Korea.

Tarkhov, Sergei and Dmitriy Merzlov. &quot;North Korean Surprises - Part 3&quot;. (Trolleybus Magazine No. 246, November–December 2002).

===Air===
The only airport in Nampo is the military Onch&#x27;ŏn Air Base in Onch&#x27;ŏn-gun.

===Rail===

The first rail line in Korea was built connecting Pyongyang and Chinnampo in 1895 by the Japanese military. It was an 88 km line with cars that were man-powered and running on tracks but was dismantled not long after it began operation.

The greater Nampo area is densely served by the Korean State Railway, with a number of stations on the P&#x27;yŏngnam Line, the entirety of the Ryonggang, Sŏhaekammun, Posan, Nampohang and Taean lines, and one station on the Ŭllyul Line being located inside the boundaries of Namp&#x27;o-t&#x27;ŭkpyŏlsi. Branches off the Pyongnam line at Nampo station specifically serve the Nampo Smelting Complex and Nampo Electrode Factory.

=== Water ===

==== River ====
With the city sitting on the Taedong River, river transport is a significant form of transport. Passenger ships run from Nampo Port to Sohae-ri, Songrim, Unchon County and Pyongyang. Cruise ships run between Waudo and the West Sea Barrage, and between Waudo and Mangyongdae.

====Sea====
The West Sea Barrage of the port of Nampo, built by erecting an 8-km long sea wall, has three lock chambers which allow the passage of ships up to 50,000 tons, and 36 sluices. Nampo Harbour is often used as the primary port of call for receiving foreign food aid assistance into North Korea. The port of Nampo has modern harbour facilities that can accommodate ships of 20,000 tonnes but is frozen during the winter. Nampo serves as Pyongyang&#x27;s port on the Yellow Sea. Contrary to most ports, containers that are offloaded at the port are not transported; instead, the contents are removed and transported by cargo trucks, while the containers remain at the port, waiting for goods to be shipped out.

In 2008, the harbour received several batches of grain delivery; the first batch delivered in June was sent by the United States and weighed 38,000 tons. A South Korean-based relief organisation, Join Together Society, donated one batch of flour in October of the same year weighing approximately 500 tons.

Vehicle transport ships carry trucks between Nampo port and South Hwanghae Province through the West Sea Barrage, which saves time and fuel from driving a longer distance to the province.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a noticeable decrease in traffic at the Nampo Coal Port, with just a few or no ships visible. Two tanks for petroleum or oil were finally built in 2020 after the bases were completed in 2016, while the other bases for the tanks remains unused. A separate oil terminal also started construction in 2020, including a new offshore wharf. Walls were built with shipping containers which marked a path to the warehouses and divided the port into cargo storage areas, although the purpose is not known but possibly related to COVID-19. The port mainly handles trade of concrete and coal.

=== Historical relics ===
Parts of the World Cultural Heritage listed Koguryo tombs are located in Ryonggang County, dating to the 5th century which provides much information on the study of the social, architectural, painting and castles of the Koguryo dynasty. Although most of the murals have faded away, a portrait and a map are still present on the south walls. 

An early Koryo Dynasty era granite Buddhist image was unearthed by the Kim Il Sung University and and registered to the list of national treasures in 2019. Various other artefacts were also unearthed along with it, such as iron arrowheads, metallic currency and pottery. It appears to depict Bhaisajyaguru as it is holding a gallipot with both hands.

The Hwangnyong Fortress was built during Koguryo and repaired in year 919 under the Koryo Dynasty. The original purpose was to defend Pyongyang from invaders in the southwest. The peaks in the north, east, south and west of the fort are used as observation posts during peacetime and can be used as command posts during wartime.

There are three historical tombs in Nampo, all dating to the Goguryeo dynasty.

<doc id="388770" wikidata="Q1185254" url="?curid=388770" title="Vladimir Guerrero">
<text>Vladimir Guerrero Alvino (born February 9, 1975), nicknamed &quot;Vlad the Impaler&quot;, is a Dominican former professional baseball player who spent 16 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a right fielder and designated hitter. He played for the Montreal Expos (–), Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (–), Texas Rangers (), and Baltimore Orioles ().

A nine-time All-Star, Guerrero was widely recognized for his impressive offensive production — regularly hitting for power and average — as well as his defensive range and strong throwing arm. In 2004, he was voted the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP). Guerrero helped lead the Angels to five AL West championships between 2004 and 2009 and was voted one of the most feared hitters in baseball in a 2008 poll of all 30 major league managers.

Regarded as the game&#x27;s premier &quot;bad-ball hitter&quot;, Guerrero consistently hit balls thrown well outside the strike zone, a skill evident on August 14, 2009, when he hit a pitch after it bounced in front of home plate. With his aggressive batting style, he hit more than 30 home runs (HR) in each of 8 seasons and surpassed 100 runs batted in (RBI) 10 times, though he had just 2 seasons with at least 65 walks. In the first pitch of an at-bat, Guerrero hit 126 home runs and put 1,780 balls in play.

On September 26, 2011, Guerrero surpassed Julio Franco as the all-time MLB leader for hits by a Dominican player, a record since broken by Adrián Beltré in 2014. In 2018, Guerrero was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2021, Guerrero and his son Vladimir Jr. became the second father-son duo in MLB history to each have a 40-home run season in their careers, joining Cecil and Prince Fielder. His .318 career batting average is the highest of any player who primarily played in the 21st century.

==Early life and career==
Guerrero was raised in Don Gregorio, Dominican Republic, in a house made of mud and brick and a palm-leaf roof. Guerrero&#x27;s mother, Altagracia, made money selling food on the street until Hurricane David ravaged the country in 1979. After the hurricane, his mother traveled between the Dominican Republic and Venezuela in order to find work, while Guerrero and his siblings were in the care of a great aunt.

One of nine children, Guerrero is the younger brother of ex-major leaguer Wilton Guerrero of the Montreal Expos, where the two were teammates for several seasons. Guerrero and his brothers played baseball using makeshift gloves assembled from milk cartons and socks filled with plastic bags as baseballs. Guerrero did not own a real baseball glove until he was 15 years old, when he received one from his older brother, a minor leaguer. Guerrero&#x27;s brothers, Eleazar and Julio Cesar, played in the farm systems of the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers, respectively. Guerrero is also the cousin of minor leaguers Armando Guerrero and Cristian Guerrero, and the uncle of major leaguer Gabriel Guerrero.

As a teenager, Guerrero worked out for the Dodgers at their baseball complex in the Dominican Republic but he was ultimately sent home after eight months without a contract. In 1993, scout Arturo DeFreites convinced the Montreal Expos to sign Guerrero for $2,100 (). During the process he lied about his age, claiming to be born February 9, 1976. It was not until March 2009 that he inadvertently revealed to Major League Baseball that he was born in 1975.

==Career==

===Montreal Expos===
Guerrero was signed by the Montreal Expos as an unsigned amateur free agent, on March 1, 1993. He advanced quickly through the Expos&#x27; Minor League Baseball (MiLB) farm system, making his MLB debut on September 19, 1996. That night, Guerrero went 1-for-5 at the plate; his first big league hit, a single to center field, came against Atlanta Braves starting pitcher Steve Avery, in the top of the fourth inning, at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium. Two nights later, on September 21, 1996, Braves closer Mark Wohlers yielded Guerrero&#x27;s first career home run (HR) — a ninth-inning blast that capped Montreal&#x27;s scoring, in a 5–4 loss. That contest is also significant, in that it marks Guerrero&#x27;s first multi-hit game.

Guerrero was criticized during his first full season, in 1997 (he had played only nine games, in 1996), for being too aggressive at the plate. Nonetheless, he put up solid numbers for a rookie, batting .302, with 11 home runs and 40 runs batted in (RBI), in just 325 at bats (AB).

Guerrero led all big league outfielders in errors, in 1997 (12; tied), 1998 (17), 1999 (19), 2000 (10; tied), and 2001 (12; tied). He also led all NL outfielders in errors in 2002 (10), and led all AL outfielders in 2006 (11), and 2007 (nine).

Scorn for Guerrero&#x27;s free-swinging ways changed into admiration, in 1998. While he continued to swing at pitches that were clearly balls, he also continued to hit them with authority. In one instance, Guerrero got a base hit off a pitch that bounced before arriving at home plate. His superior hand-eye coordination and prodigious strength allowed him to be unusually aggressive at the plate, but still put up high batting averages year after year. Despite Guerrero&#x27;s freeswinging style, he never struck out 100 times in a season.

Guerrero batted .324, with 38 home runs, and 109 RBI, in 1998. Before the end of the 1998 season, he agreed to a $28 million deal. Guerrero represented the Expos at the 1999 All-Star Game. During the 1999 season, he maintained a 31-game hitting streak‚ the longest in the majors in 12 years. Guerrero finished 1999 with 131 RBI, and in 2000, he hit 44 home runs; both figures are career highs.

On July 7, 2001, Guerrero threw out Alberto Castillo in one of the best throws in MLB history. After a base hit by Toronto, Castillo, then a baserunner on second base, saw an opportunity to score a run, as the batter had hit the ball well into deep right field. Guerrero caught the ball off a bounce and threw it to his catcher, who caught it squarely. Castillo was tagged out short of home plate. The throw&#x27;s distance has been estimated to have been roughly three hundred feet, with its vertical arch peaking at merely 21 feet.

Guerrero posted similar or slightly improved numbers through the 2002 season. He had also developed a running game, stealing 37 bases in 2001. Guerrero also hit 34 home runs, joining the 30–30 club for the first time in his career and leading the major leagues in power-speed number (35.4).

In 2002, Guerrero led the National League with 206 base hits and 364 total bases. He also stole a career-high 40 bases and fell one home run short of becoming the fourth member of the 40–40 club. He became the first player in major league history to hit 30 home runs, steal 40 bases, and hit above .330 in one season. However, Guerrero led the majors in times caught stealing (20).

Guerrero&#x27;s 2003 season was shortened due to a back injury. In 394 at-bats, he hit .330, with 25 home runs and 79 RBIs. Because of the injury, some in the media thought signing him would be a risk. While Guerrero was playing injured, though, he still managed to hit for the cycle, on September 14, 2003. He would be the final Expo to hit for the cycle before their relocation to Washington after the 2004 season.

Throughout his career, Guerrero set single season Expos records in batting average, slugging, on-base plus slugging (OPS), home runs, RBI, total bases (TB), hits, extra base hits (XBH), TOB, IBB, as well as several other records. He is the all time Expos career leader in batting (.323), homers (234), slugging (.588), and OPS (.978). Guerrero won the Montreal Expos Player of the Year award in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2002.

===Anaheim Angels / Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim===
Guerrero was a free agent for the first time after the 2003 season, and signed a five-year, $70 million deal that included a mutual $15 million option for a sixth year with the Anaheim Angels on January 14, 2004, after being courted by several teams. The owner of the Angels, Arte Moreno, was the first Hispanic and Latino American controlling owner of a Major League ball club, and Guerrero cited Moreno&#x27;s heritage as a motivating factor for choosing the Angels over other teams.

During his first season with Angels, Guerrero led his club, and in some cases the American League (AL), in several offensive categories, including 124 runs (set new club record and led the AL), 13 outfield assists (Tied for 1st in AL), 366 total bases (tied club record and led AL), and a season ending batting average of .337 (3rd in AL). He was the second player in club history with .300/30/100 numbers. Among AL leaders, he finished in the top 10 of 20 major offensive categories,
which led to Guerrero being voted the Gene Autry Trophy (Team MVP) by his teammates. Making his fifth MLB All-Star game appearance in July, he led AL outfielders with 3,024,870 votes and was the first Angel outfielder to be a starter since Reggie Jackson in 1984.

Guerrero continued his offensive dominance in September, earning American League Player of the Month after batting .371 with 24 runs scored, six doubles, a triple, 10 home runs and 23 RBI. Guerrero was clutch down the stretch. Over the final seven games of the season, his 10 runs, six home runs and 11 RBI helped the Angels overcome a 3-game deficit, which ultimately led to an American League West Division Crown.

Down the stretch of the 2004 MLB season, Guerrero was impressive. Mike Scioscia, the Angels manager, said that Guerrero &quot;really carried us on his back&quot; in the last month of the season, as the Angels overtook first place from the faltering Oakland Athletics who finished the season one game behind in the standings. Guerrero leading the Angels to their first Western Division title since 1986 (The Angels won the 2002 World Series as the American League Wild Card). These late-season heroics led to Guerrero being chosen as the second Angel to win the AL MVP in franchise history. He finished with 354 points, 100 more than second-place finisher Gary Sheffield.

In the opening best-of-5 round of the playoffs, the Angels were swept by the Boston Red Sox, and Guerrero had an odd batting line: just a .167 average, but six RBIs in three games. He would also have a grand slam in Game 3.
The Angels won the Western Division again in 2005, with Guerrero batting .317 with 32 home runs and 108 RBIs in 520 at bats. Late in the season, Guerrero became the 12th player to hit his 300th home run before the age of 30 (along with Hank Aaron, Jimmie Foxx, Mickey Mantle, Eddie Mathews, Harmon Killebrew, Mel Ott, Frank Robinson, Alex Rodriguez, Ken Griffey Jr., Juan González, and Andruw Jones, who achieved the mark about the same time as Guerrero).

Guerrero had an up-and-down 2005 postseason, batting .389 in ALDS victory over the New York Yankees, but just .050 in the ALCS against the eventual world champion Chicago White Sox. He fared better in a national TV ad for Pepsi with the Yankees&#x27; third baseman Alex Rodriguez; the two engaged in a personal home run competition that ended up with the moon being broken. Guerrero also appeared at Game Four of the 2005 World Series, where he was introduced as a member of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Latino Legends Team.

Guerrero recorded his 1,000th career RBI on July 15, 2006, at home against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.

Making his 8th Major League Baseball All-Star Game appearance, Guerrero subsequently won his first career Home Run Derby in the 2007 season, highlighted by a home run. He is the third Angel to win the Derby (after Wally Joyner in 1986, and Garret Anderson in 2003). Guerrero was chosen for the All-Star Game in each of his first four seasons with the Angels (2004–2007). 

Guerrero and the Angels exercised their mutual option and Guerrero remained with the team for a sixth year in 2009. Guerrero&#x27;s stellar fielding talent dwindled in the later 2000s due to age and injuries, prompting the long-time outfielder to be reassigned as a designated hitter at the start of the 2009 season.

In 2009, Guerrero was named number 37 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball. A panel of 100 baseball people, many of them members of the Baseball Hall of Fame and winners of major baseball awards, was polled to arrive at the list.

On August 10, Guerrero hit his 400th career home run off Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Russ Springer. On August 26, he recorded his 1,000th career hit as an Angel, a single off Detroit Tigers pitcher Edwin Jackson. This hit made Guerrero only the fourth player (following Frank Robinson, Dave Winfield, and Fred McGriff) to record 1,000 hits as both a National League player &quot;and&quot; as an American League player.

On October 11, in the ninth inning, Guerrero delivered a two-run single, off Jonathan Papelbon of the Boston Red Sox, scoring Bobby Abreu and Chone Figgins. The clutch base knock gave the Angels a 7–6 lead and eventually the win to finally advance to the ALCS, beating the Red Sox for the first time ever in the postseason.

2009 was the first time that Guerrero had a batting average below .300 (.295), an OPS below .800 (.794), or a doubles total less than 20 (16).

===Texas Rangers===

On January 11, 2010, Guerrero signed a one-year, $5.5 million deal with incentives and a 2011 option with the Texas Rangers.

He broke up a no-hitter by Shaun Marcum in the seventh inning of the Opening Day game against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 5, 2010.
On May 6, 2010, Guerrero hit two home runs versus the Kansas City Royals to secure a 13–12 win. On May 13, 2010, Guerrero&#x27;s walk off line drive to left field won the final game of a three-game series against the Oakland Athletics in the bottom of the 12th. On May 25, 2010, he hit two more home runs to secure another win over the Kansas City Royals. On June 30, 2010, against his former team, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Guerrero hit two home runs and went 4-for-4 with 5 RBIs.

Guerrero wound up appearing in 152 games with a batting average of .300, 29 home runs and 115 RBIs. He earned a Silver Slugger Award in the regular season for a Texas Rangers club that wound up winning its division and ultimately, the first pennant in Rangers history. He also won the Edgar Martínez Award and earned his ninth invitation to the All-Star Game. On October 22, 2010, Guerrero drove in 3 runs during game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees, capturing the first American League pennant for the Texas Rangers. The Rangers would go on to lose the World Series to the San Francisco Giants in five games. On November 3 the Rangers declined to pick up Guerrero&#x27;s 2011 option making him a free agent.

===Baltimore Orioles===

Guerrero signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles on February 18, 2011. He became the all-time MLB hits leader among Dominican-born players when he singled off Josh Beckett in the sixth inning of a 6–3 victory over the Boston Red Sox at Camden Yards on September 26, 2011. In 2011, Guerrero hit .290, his lowest batting average since his rookie year with the Montreal Expos in 1996. He also had 13 home runs, 63 RBIs, and 163 base hits for Orioles.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Guerrero remained unsigned by any team going into the 2012 Major League Baseball season, leading to much speculation about his potential retirement, though Guerrero insisted that he would not retire. On May 10, 2012, Guerrero signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. During his first game for the Class-A Dunedin Blue Jays on Sunday May 27, 2012, Guerrero hit a home run. Guerrero played in 4 games for Dunedin, with 9 hits in 20 at bats, including 4 home runs and was then promoted to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s. With the 51s he played in 8 games, with 10 hits in 33 at-bats (.303 avg). He asked for, and was granted, his release on June 12, 2012.

===Dominican Professional Baseball League===
He started playing in the Dominican Professional Baseball League with the San Pedro de Macorís team Estrellas Orientales. On November 4, 2012, Guerrero came back to the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de la República Dominicana with Tigres del Licey. He played only eight games with Tigres logging a batting average of .188 without a home run. On November 20, 2012, Guerrero quit the team after he was informed by team management that he would be used only as a pinch hitter.

===Long Island Ducks===
On April 4, 2013, Guerrero signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League. He informed the team that he had family issues to attend to and would not be joining them to start the season. He never appeared with the team in the 2013 season.

===Retirement and Hall of Fame induction===

On March 31, 2014, Guerrero signed a one-day contract with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and officially retired from professional baseball. Having played his last game in 2011, he became eligible for induction to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2017 and was inducted in 2018 along with Chipper Jones, Jim Thome, and Trevor Hoffman, earning 92.9% of the vote. Guerrero is the first member of the Hall to be depicted with an Angels cap, even though he appeared in more games (1004-846) and played in more seasons (8-6) as a Montreal Expo.

===Career statistics===
In 2,147 games over 16 seasons, Guerrero posted a .318 batting average (2,590 for 8,155) with 1,328 runs, 477 doubles, 46 triples, 449 home runs, 1,496 RBI, 181 stolen bases, 737 bases on balls, .379 on-base percentage, and .553 slugging percentage. Defensively, he finished his career with a .963 fielding percentage. In 44 postseason games, he hit .263 (45-for-171) with 17 runs, seven doubles, two home runs, 20 RBI, two stolen bases, and 14 walks.

==Batting style==
Guerrero batted without wearing batting gloves, a custom rarely seen in modern baseball. In an interview with Yahoo! Sports, he attributed this to helping his grandfather pull cows home barehanded as a young boy in the Dominican Republic. To improve his grip on the bat, Guerrero coated his helmet with pine tar and rubbed his helmet before going to the on-deck circle. As the season progressed, his batting helmet would become covered in the substance.

Guerrero batted over .300 from 1997 to 2008. He drove in over 100 runs every season between 1998 and 2007, except for 2003. Along with his 2004 MVP season, he finished 6th (2000), 4th (2002), 3rd (2005), 9th (2006), and 3rd (2007) in MVP voting.

In 2008, Guerrero swung at a higher percentage of pitches outside the strike zone, 45.5%, than any other hitter in major league baseball up to that time. This resulted in significantly fewer balls taken by Guerrero compared to other batters of his caliber, although did reduce the percentage of strikes Guerrero took.

Guerrero had a 44-game hitting streak exclusively against the Texas Rangers, from 2004 to 2006, the longest such player-vs.-team streak in MLB history, since 1969. The streak occurred over his first 44 appearances against the Rangers. The streak finally came to an end in August 2006 in a game in which Guerrero was intentionally walked three times, walked four times overall, and finished 0-for-1. He decimated Ranger pitching over the course of his major league career, putting up a career batting line of .395/.461/.661/1.122, with 25 home runs, 34 doubles, and 70 RBI, in 108 games played. During the 2009 postseason, Cal Ripken Jr. commented during a TBS postgame report that Guerrero was &quot;the best bad-ball hitter I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. On one occasion in a game against the Baltimore Orioles, Guerrero hit a pitch that bounced in the dirt before home plate. Even more unusual, his bat struck the ground as well before hitting the ball.

==World Baseball Classic==
Guerrero was named to the Dominican Republic&#x27;s roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic, although he eventually withdrew due to the death of three cousins in a car accident immediately before the tournament.

== Personal life ==
His son, Vladimir Jr., was born in Montreal in 1999 during the elder Guerrero&#x27;s time with the Expos. Vladimir Jr. signed with the Toronto Blue Jays on July 2, 2015, made his major league debut on April 26, 2019, and won the All-Star Game MVP on July 13, 2021. Another son, Pablo Guerrero, signed with the Texas Rangers as an international free agent in January 2023. Another son, Vladimir Miguel Guerrero, signed with the New York Mets on January 15, 2024.

Guerrero has provided job opportunities in his hometown in the Dominican Republic through his business ventures: a concrete-block factory, a propane distribution company, a supermarket, a livestock and vegetable farm, and a women&#x27;s clothing store.

<doc id="388772" wikidata="Q324433" url="?curid=388772" title="Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)">
<text>The Queen of Hearts is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1865 book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; by Lewis Carroll. She is a childish, foul-tempered monarch whom Carroll himself describes as &quot;a blind fury&quot;, and who is quick to give death sentences at even the slightest of offenses. One of her most famous lines is the oft-repeated &quot;Off with his/her head!&quot; / &quot;Off with their heads!&quot;

The Queen is referred to as a card from a pack of playing cards by Alice, yet somehow she is able to talk and is the ruler of the lands in the story, alongside her husband, the King of Hearts. She is often confused with the Red Queen from the 1871 sequel, &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, although the two are very different.

==Overview==
Alice observes three playing cards painting white roses red. They drop to the ground face down at the approach of the Queen of Hearts, whom Alice has never met. When the Queen arrives, along with the King and their ten children, and asks Alice who is lying on the ground (since the backs of all playing cards look alike), Alice tells her that she does not know. The Queen then becomes frustrated and commands that her head be chopped off. She is deterred by her comparatively moderate husband by being reminded that Alice is only a child.

Generally, however, as we are told by Carroll:

:&quot;The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. &#x27;Off with his head!&#x27; she said, without even looking around.&quot;

One of the Queen&#x27;s hobbies – besides ordering executions – is croquet; however, it is Wonderland croquet, where the balls are live hedgehogs and the mallets are flamingoes. This is presumably with the aim that the birds&#x27; blunt beaks should strike, but, as Alice observes, it is complicated by the fact that they keep looking back up at the players- as well as the hedgehogs&#x27; tendency to scuttle away without waiting to be hit. The Queen&#x27;s soldiers act as the arches (or hoops) on the croquet grounds, but have to leave off being arches every time the Queen has an executioner drag away the victim, so that, by the end of the game in the story, the only players that remain are the Queen herself, the King, and Alice.

Despite the frequency of death sentences, it would appear few people are actually beheaded. The King of Hearts quietly pardons many of his subjects when the Queen is not looking (although this did not seem to be the case with The Duchess), and her soldiers humor her but do not carry out her orders. The Gryphon tells Alice, &quot;It&#x27;s all her fancy: she executes nobody, you know.&quot; Nevertheless, all creatures in Wonderland fear the Queen. In the final chapters, the Queen sentences Alice again (for defending the Knave of Hearts), and she offers a bizarre approach towards justice: sentence before the verdict.

Modern portrayals in popular culture usually let her play the role of a villain because of the menace the character exemplifies, but in the book she does not fill that purpose. She is just one of the many obstacles that Alice has to encounter on the journey, but unlike other obstacles, she makes a higher potential threat.

==Origins==
The Queen is believed by some to be a caricature of Queen Victoria, with elements of reality that Carroll felt correctly would make her at once instantly recognizable to parents reading the story to children, and also fantastical enough to make her unrecognizable to children. Some elements of reality in line that would make the Queen of Hearts recognizable as Queen Victoria were the way in which their subjects viewed them as rulers as one Queen was loved while the other was feared. Queen Victoria was loved more by her people in contrast with her consort, Prince Albert, in part because some did not trust him as he wasn&#x27;t English. The Queen of Hearts was feared by the people of Wonderland and would give the order for execution for even the slightest offense, although her husband would often quietly pardon them. The reference to Queen Victoria is explicit in Jonathan Miller&#x27;s 1966 television version where she and the King of Hearts are portrayed without any attempt at fantasy, or disguise as to their true natures or personality.

The Queen may also be a reference to Queen Margaret of the House of Lancaster. During the War of the Roses, a red rose was the symbol of the House Lancaster. Their rivals, the House of York, had a white rose for their symbol. The gardeners&#x27; painting the white roses red may be a reference to these two houses. It is also possible that she is based on Queen Elizabeth I, as her yelling &quot;off with their head&quot; demonstrates the Victorian stereotype of a Tudor king/queen.

==Illustrations==
After unsuccessfully attempting to illustrate &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; himself, Lewis Carroll was persuaded to engage a professional artist to provide the illustrations. He turned to cartoonist John Tenniel, who was known for his regular contributions to the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot; (published 1841–1992, 1996–2002).

Tenniel&#x27;s inspiration for the Queen of Hearts was an image of Elizabeth de Mowbray, Duchess of Norfolk in one of the medieval stained glass windows at Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford, Suffolk.

The illustrations for the &quot;Alice&quot; books were engraved onto blocks of wood, to be printed in the wood engraving process. The original wood blocks are now in the collection of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England. They are not usually on public display, but were exhibited in 2003.

==Confusion with the Red Queen==

She is commonly mistaken for the Red Queen in the story&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, but in reality shares none of her characteristics other than being a queen. Carroll, in his lifetime, made the distinction of the two Queens by saying:

The 1951 animated film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; perpetuates the long-standing confusion between the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts. In the film, the Queen of Hearts delivers several of the Red Queen&#x27;s statements, the most notable being based on her &quot;all the ways about here belong to me&quot;. Both characters say this to suggest their importance and possible arrogance, but in the Red Queen&#x27;s case, it has a double meaning since her status as a Chess-queen means that she can move in any direction she desires.

In the &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; adaptation of the books, the characters are also conflated, leading to further popular misconception.

==Adaptations==

===Disney===

In the Disney animated feature &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, the Queen of Hearts appears as the movie&#x27;s main villain. She makes her appearance at the climax of the movie.

The character was voiced by Verna Felton. She is portrayed as a haughty sadist, who enjoys decapitating anyone who merely annoys her. Her presence is all the more striking because of how tiny her husband the King is (he barely comes up to her knee). Similar to the book, Alice meets three cards painting the roses red, since they planted white roses by mistake. When the Queen arrives, she finds those three cards guilty and shouts &quot;Off with their heads!&quot; Once the unfortunate cards are dragged away, she turns her attention to Alice. Refusing to answer her questions with a presumption that only she can ask them, she quickly ropes her into a game of croquet. The game ends with the Queen tripping herself over, and Alice is punished unfairly by the Queen as a result of the Cheshire Cat&#x27;s mischievous antics. Before the Queen can give the order, the King suggests holding a trial for Alice. The Queen, grudgingly, but reasonably, agrees. At Alice’s trial, the Queen calls the March Hare, the Dormouse, and the Mad Hatter to witness, who hold an unbirthday party for her and cheer her up considerably. During the party, the Cheshire Cat reappears and upsets the Dormouse. The frightened Dormouse runs all over, and in an attempt to crush the Dormouse, the King of Hearts accidentally hits the Queen on the head with the gavel, which is hastily passed into the March Hare&#x27;s hands, then the Hatter&#x27;s, and finally Alice&#x27;s. The Queen, of course, punishes Alice unfairly for it and is going to have her arrested. But Alice eats mushrooms she had procured earlier, which make her grow bigger. Although Rule No. 42 says that anyone more than a mile high must leave the court immediately, Alice feels free to call the Queen a &quot;fat, pompous, bad tempered old tyrant&quot;. Unfortunately, she subsequently shrinks down to her normal size, but flees and is able to escape.

Of interest is the fact that Disney&#x27;s Queen of Hearts seems to be an amalgamation of the Queen from the book, the Duchess, and the Red Queen of &quot;Through The Looking-Glass&quot;. When pleased, she can be quite pleasant, but is still bossy and often impatient, and can almost at once change to enraged.

She is one of the primary members of the &quot;Disney Villains&quot; franchise. She is also a greetable character at the Disney Parks.

==== Other films and television appearances ====
In the 1991 Disney Channel series &quot;Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, the Queen was played by Armelia McQueen. She appears as a short-tempered and childish but basically benevolent ruler. She was alternately called &quot;The Queen of Hearts&quot; and &quot;The Red Queen&quot; during the course of the series.

She has recurring cameos in the television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, voiced by Tress MacNeille, as well as its direct-to-video films &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s House of Villains&quot;, in the last one being one of the main villains who take over the House of Mouse.

Another Queen of Hearts (real name Valentina Corazón) appeared in the animated series &quot;Alice&#x27;s Wonderland Bakery&quot; (possibly a descendant of her like the rest of the characters in the series with respect to the characters in the 1951 film), voiced by Eden Espinosa, who was nominated for the Children&#x27;s and Family Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice Performance in a Preschool Animated Program for her performance. She also has a daughter named Rosa, who is one of the best friends of Alice (great-granddaughter of the Alice from the film).

The Queen of Hearts appears in the live-action film &quot;&quot;, played by Rita Ora and Ruby Rose Turner (this last as Bridget, a young Queen of Hearts), where her daughter Red is a main character.

==== Disney video games ====
The Queen of Hearts is the final boss on the Japanese version of &quot;Mickey Mousecapade&quot; (being replaced by Maleficent in the North American version), a 1987 video game where Alice is her hostage.

The Queen of Hearts exacted her revenge upon Alice in the game &quot;Disney&#x27;s Villains&#x27; Revenge&quot; where she stole the ending page of the story and changed the ending, so Alice lost her head. Jiminy Cricket, the player and Alice&#x27;s headless body retrieve the head and escape the labyrinth of the Queen. They meet one last time in the final battle and she surrenders.

The Queen appears in the Square-Enix/Disney video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, in her homeworld. As in the film, she holds Alice on trial, only this time for attempting to steal her heart. The main heroes in the game, Sora, Donald, and Goofy, intervene, telling the Queen that Alice is innocent. The Queen challenges them to provide proof of their theory, and with help from the Cheshire Cat, the three are able to do so. The Queen, however, enraged at being proven wrong, orders them executed and Alice imprisoned in a cage on the roof. The three are able to fight off the Queen&#x27;s guards and destroy the cage controls, but Alice is kidnapped before they can save her. The Queen orders a search for Alice, and temporarily pardons Sora, Donald, and Goofy, requesting that they look for Alice as well. She returns in &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, only this time as a figment of Sora&#x27;s memories. Again, she holds Alice on trial, this time for attempting to steal her memories. In both games, Sora, Donald, and Goofy prove Alice&#x27;s innocence by defeating the Trickmaster Heartless, the real culprit. The Queen congratulates Sora for solving the mystery, and once again demonstrates her bi-polar personality by pardoning Alice. She is absent in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, but appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot; along with her homeworld. A digital version of her later appears in &quot;Kingdom Hearts coded&quot;.

The Queen of Hearts appears as a playable character to unlock for a limited time in the video game &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;.

===Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (2010)===
===&quot;Alice&#x27;s Warped Wonderland&quot;===
In the Sunsoft&#x27;s 2006 mobile game , the Queen of Hearts&#x27;s personality and appearance is vastly different from other versions of the character. She is depicted as a beautiful young girl with long blond hair in a pink dress and wields a large scythe. While emotional at times and a has morbid fondness for beheading people, the Queen loves Ariko (the &quot;Alice&quot; of the game), claiming to love her most out of all the other Wonderland denizens, and wants to protect her from remembering her suppressed memories of her traumatic childhood. However, due to Ariko&#x27;s depressed state of mind, the Queen&#x27;s love for Alice is warped and seeks to behead her as way to protect her (which she succeed in one of the bad endings). Like the Cheshire Cat and the White Rabbit, the Queen possess the power to enter the real world and interact with people besides Ariko.

===&quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;===
In the video game &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, the Queen of Hearts is the final boss and the reason for Wonderland&#x27;s decay. When Alice fights her, she discovers that the Queen is her dark side – an embodiment of her insanity; the Queen must be destroyed for Alice to become sane once more. The Queen&#x27;s appearance is different in &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot; from how she is in the book: she appears first as a faceless entity having tentacles for arms, legs, and hair. It is later revealed that this is a mere puppet and that the true Queen of Hearts is a horrible monster in the image of a real anatomical heart. She is called both the Queen of Hearts and the Red Queen interchangeably throughout the game. No mention is made of the Red Queen from &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;. However, the White Queen is seen for only a moment, as her head is chopped off by the enemy in The Pale Realm. It&#x27;s implied that after Alice was placed in the asylum the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts fused together which explains why the Queen of Hearts is able to control the red piece and the cards at the same time.

In the sequel, &quot;&quot;, the Queen of Hearts is sought by Alice for assistance in stopping an Infernal Train from tearing apart Wonderland and driving her back into insanity. The Queen claims, when found in the ruins of the Red Kingdom, that Alice is being manipulated by someone other than herself, that this person is trying to erase her memories, particularly about the fire in her childhood, which is tearing her sanity apart. It later turns out that this person is none other than her psychiatrist Dr. Angus Bumby, who has been revealed to have raped Alice&#x27;s older sister Lizzy and burned down the house with Lizzy and Alice&#x27;s parents to cover up the crime, and that he is attempting to erase Alice&#x27;s memories and subject her to prostitution after it. In this sequel, the Red Queen has changed considerably, taking the appearance of a younger Alice, only in a royal dress befitting the Queen of Hearts, with large fleshy claws rather than hands, and her lower body composed of fleshy tentacles that spread throughout the entire castle, which is actually the Queen&#x27;s body itself. Some argue she is actually based not on Alice herself, but her sister, as she also referred to her as &quot;Lizzy&quot; in the following dialogue, and considering she felt guilty of the death of her family, its possible her subconscious projected her dead sister in the queen she herself killed in the previous game.

===&quot;The Looking Glass Wars&quot;===
In &quot;The Looking Glass Wars&quot; by Frank Beddor, the ruling dynasty of the Wonderland is the Heart family. The title of Queen of Hearts is a hereditary title for the Queen of Wonderland. The Queen of Hearts from &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; is reimagined as Queen Redd, the enemy and aunt of the heroine, Alyss. She kills Alyss&#x27;s parents and usurps the throne of Wonderland.

The true Queen of Hearts in this story is Genevieve Heart, Alyss&#x27;s mother as an apparent re-imagining of the White Queen. Alyss is, therefore, the Princess of Hearts.

===&quot;Alice in the Country of Hearts&quot;===
In the manga &quot;Alice in the Country of Hearts&quot;, the Queen of Hearts is known as Vivaldi. She isn&#x27;t as much a main character, though, and she has very few parts in the current books. Vivaldi rules Heart Castle and is feuding with the other territories over Wonderland. She is beautiful with black hair, unlike other adaptations. She speaks in the majestic plural, e.g., &quot;We are happy you are here to see us.&quot; As discovered through Heart no Kuni no Alice the game by Quinrose (the predecessor to the manga). Blood Dupree (The Hatter) is Vivaldi&#x27;s little brother though it is alluded to be a romantic interest for Vivaldi until Alice discovers the secret.

===SyFy TV miniseries===
In the two-part series &quot;Alice&quot;, hosted by the SyFy Channel, the Queen of Hearts is portrayed by Kathy Bates as a refined but ruthless drug lord. The miniseries is set one hundred and fifty years after the original Alice&#x27;s first visit to Wonderland (the heroine is an unrelated character) and the Queen is (as usual) the primary villain of the series. As is customary, the Queen is depicted as narcissistic, declaring herself as &quot;the most powerful woman in the history of literature&quot; and obese. Her calm, cold demeanour suggests that she too is a mixture of the Queen of Hearts and the Red Queen. Her name is given as &quot;Mary Elizabeth Heart&quot;, and it is suggested that the Hearts are the &quot;Red&quot; royal family who seized control of Wonderland from the &quot;White&quot; royal family.

===&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;===

The Queen of Hearts appears in the &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; episode &quot;Hat Trick&quot;, played by Jennifer Koenig. In the show&#x27;s second season, it is revealed that the Queen of Hearts is, in fact, Cora (Barbara Hershey), the mother of the Evil Queen and the Wicked Witch of the West. In her earlier life, Cora (portrayed by Rose McGowan) was also the miller&#x27;s daughter (the heroine of the &quot;Rumpelstiltskin&quot; story).

Cora abandons her first born, Zelena, after realising that the father is not royalty as she believed. When she has a baby girl with King Henry, she names her Regina and raises Regina to be queen. Cora stages the death of Snow White&#x27;s mother, and manipulates Regina into becoming Snow&#x27;s stepmother by marrying the girl&#x27;s father, King Leopold. After killing Regina&#x27;s true love, Daniel the stable boy, Regina banishes Cora to Wonderland through a looking-glass, where she eventually becomes the Queen of Hearts. The show&#x27;s spin-off, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Wonderland&quot;, shows that Cora was the Red Queen&#x27;s tutor in magic whilst in Wonderland; Cora apparently ruled part of the land and was a political rival of the Red King.

Years later, after Regina has become the Evil Queen, she sets out to cast a Dark Curse and send all the fairytale characters to the Land Without Magic. Regina hires Captain Hook to kill Cora so she won&#x27;t follow Regina to this new land. However, Cora convinces Hook to team up with her, and once the curse is eventually broken, Cora and Hook travel to the town of Storybrooke where Regina believes her mother is dead. Cora thwarts Regina&#x27;s plans for redemption by framing her for murder in order to manipulate her back into villainy so that they can take over the town and kill Rumplestiltskin, obtaining his great power. However, Snow White tricks Regina into killing Cora before they succeed.

Years later, Cora&#x27;s soul resides in the Underworld, believing Regina to be her unfinished business. When a redeemed Regina visits the Underworld with her new allies, Cora reunites with her daughter and, forcibly working for Hades, tries to convince Regina to go home. When Zelena, who has grown up to be the Wicked Witch of the West, visits the Underworld, Cora realises that her unfinished business was to make amends with the daughter she abandoned and unite her estranged daughters. Cora is successful with both, and is finally able to move on to Mount Olympus.

===&quot;Come Away&quot;===
The Queen is portrayed by Angelina Jolie in the 2020 movie &quot;Come Away&quot;, and is depicted as an imaginary counterpart to Alice&#x27;s alcoholic mother Rose (also played by Jolie). This version of the Queen of Hearts is kept as separate character from the Red Queen, who is the imaginary counterpart to Rose&#x27;s stuffy and disapproving older sister Eleanor.

=== &quot;Ever After High&quot; ===
In the fashion doll franchise &quot;Ever After High&quot;, the Queen of Hearts has a daughter named Lizzie Hearts, who is also a recurring character in the franchise&#x27;s animated series. The Queen of Hearts appears in one of the animated specials where she is voiced by Karen Strassman. She also appears in some of the tie-in novels.

===Other versions and adaptations===

* In the 1999 &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; television movie, the character is played by Miranda Richardson, whose portrayal is strongly reminiscent of her role as the spoiled Queenie in &quot;Blackadder&quot;.
* In Sandra the Fairytale Detective, her name is Theressa.
* &quot;Pandora Hearts&quot; has Miranda Barma who would later become the chain Demios the Executor also nicknamed Queen of Hearts and they have a similar obsession of cutting heads.
* The Queen is one of the characters adopted by Gwen Stefani in her Wonderland-themed music video What You Waiting For?. She wears a red gown and a crown reminiscent of the Imperial State Crown from the British Crown Jewels. The Queen wanders through a garden populated with flamingos and pushes Alice (also Stefani) into a pool of her own tears.
* The Queen of Hearts features in Unsuk Chin&#x27;s 2007 opera &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;; the role was created for Dame Gwyneth Jones.
* The Queen is a major character in Christopher Wheeldon&#x27;s 2011 full-length ballet &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;, created for The Royal Ballet. The role was created for principal dancer Zenaida Yanowsky and includes a hilarious spoof of the Rose Adagio from &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;.
* The Queen appeared briefly during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in London in a segment dedicated to the villains of British children&#x27;s literature.
* In Marissa Meyer&#x27;s 2016 novel &quot;Heartless&quot;, the backstory of the Queen of Hearts is told, in which she is a young girl who aspires to be a baker, but is instead taken off course by the anticipated proposal of the King of Hearts.
* The Queen of Hearts appears in the twelfth episode (&quot;And the Broken Staff&quot;) of &quot;The Librarians&quot;. She is brought to life by the wizard Prospero as a distraction for the Librarians but is subsequently tricked into attacking her own reflection, turning her into a pack of cards (mirroring the ending of the original story).
* The manga &quot;One Piece&quot; has Charlotte Linlin, also known as &quot;Big Mom&quot;, whose appearance and character is mostly based on the Queen of Hearts.
* In Andrzej Sapkowski&#x27;s short story &quot;Złote popołudnie&quot; (&quot;The Golden Afternoon&quot;) which is postmodern retelling of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; the Queen of Hearts is identified with Queen Mab.
* In the 1998 television film &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; directed by Thomas Michael Donnelly Marianne&#x27;s character is foreshadowed at the end of the card game when the last card laid down is the Queen of Hearts.
* During the 4.5 anniversary for &quot;Dead or Alive Xtreme Venus Vacation&quot;, the character Monica plays the role of the Queen of Hearts. Her role was significantly softened compared to usual, simply dealing a game of chance regarding finding a heart, as well as willingly letting the Owner leave Wonderland after he won.
*In the manga &quot;Queen of Hearts in Wonderland&quot;, she is the protagonist; a girl who reincarnated as her from an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; video game. On the day she takes the throne, a curse twists everything she says into something cruel; meaning someone is trying to kill her. Hope comes from her allies Mad Hatter (who understands her intent) and Aleth Liddell, whom can hear her true words.
*In the 2015 Cbeebies Pantomime the Queen of Hearts is portrayed by Justin Fletcher, she is the Dame in this version and, in the tradition of Pantomime Dames, is played by a man for comedy rather than drama, as such, while she is the closest thing to a villain in the Panto, she cuts a insane toddler-like figure instead of a threat. She sings the song &quot;the Queen&quot;, about herself, with the card soldiers played by a child chorus. The King is absent &amp; the knave is reduced to a bit part.

<text>Joseph Warren Robinett Jr. (born December 25, 1951) is an American video game designer. He is most notable as the developer of the Atari 2600&#x27;s &quot;Adventure&quot; and as a founder of The Learning Company, where he designed &quot;Rocky&#x27;s Boots&quot; and &quot;Robot Odyssey&quot;. More recently he has worked on virtual reality projects.

Robinett graduated in 1974 with a B.A. from Rice University, with a major in &quot;Computer Applications to Language and Art&quot;. After graduating from Rice University, he was a Fortran programmer for Western Geophysical in Houston, Texas. He received an M.S. from University of California, Berkeley in 1976, and went to work at Atari, Inc. in November 1977.

==Atari, Inc.==
His first effort at Atari was &quot;Slot Racers&quot; for the Atari 2600. While he was working on it, he had discovered and played Crowther and Woods&#x27; &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot; at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and decided that a graphical video game version &quot;would be really cool&quot;. However, with 128 bytes of RAM and 4096 bytes of ROM, Atari&#x27;s &quot;Adventure&quot; was a much simpler program, and with only a joystick for input, the set of &quot;commands&quot; was necessarily brief. &quot;Adventure&quot; was a hit upon its 1979 release, and it eventually sold a million copies.

Atari designers at the time were not given credit for their games, because Atari feared having to bargain with well-known designers. In response to this, Robinett placed a hidden object in the game that would allow the player to reach a hidden screen which displayed the words &quot;Created by Warren Robinett,&quot; hence creating one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game, and the first to which the name &quot;Easter egg&quot; was applied.

Robinett then wrote the &quot;BASIC Programming&quot; cartridge, finishing both &quot;BASIC Programming&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot; in June 1979, and quit Atari.

==The Learning Company and later==
He founded The Learning Company in 1980, and he worked on several educational games there, including &quot;Rocky&#x27;s Boots&quot; and &quot;Robot Odyssey&quot; for the Apple II. The Learning Company was acquired by Softkey in 1995 for US$606 million.

He has since worked on virtual reality projects for NASA and the University of North Carolina.

In 2016, Robinett announced &quot;The Annotated Adventure&quot;, a book describing the design and implementation of &quot;Adventure&quot; for the Atari 2600. In 2018 Robinett stated that the initial book was being split into two books: &quot;The Annotated Adventure&quot; focusing on the technical aspect of the game and &quot;Making the Dragon&quot; focusing on the political story. As of December 2022 only the table of contents has been made public.

Robinett&#x27;s &quot;Adventure&quot; Easter egg is a plot element in the 2011 novel and 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One&quot;.

<text>Miami Executive Airport, formerly known until 2014 as Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport, is a public airport in unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida, southwest of Downtown Miami.Operated by the Miami-Dade Aviation Department, the airport is one of Florida&#x27;s busiest general aviation facilities. It supports corporate, recreational, flight training, and government aviation operations.

Miami Executive Airport airport opened on November 18, 1967, replacing the original Tamiami Airport, which was located near the Tamiami Trail. The relocation was prompted by the growth of the surrounding area and the proximity to the flight path to Miami International Airport, which necessitated the move to the southwest, near the community of Kendall. The site of the former Tamiami Airport is now home to Florida International University. 450 aircraft are based there, mostly single-engine light aircraft.

The airport serves as a port of entry, with U.S. Customs personnel available. Although not certified for airline use, Miami Executive Airport has become a hub for corporate aviation in recent years.
==History==
The airport opened in 1967, replacing an eponymous airfield to the north which closed due to its proximity to Miami International Airport. When built, the airport also had a seaplane runway which is still visible on the north side of the airfield. The airport was renamed from Kendall-Tamiami Executive Airport to Miami Executive Airport on October 7, 2014, by the Miami-Dade County Commission. All secondary airports in Miami-Dade County were rebranded to include the name &quot;Miami&quot;.

== Facilities==
The airport covers and has three asphalt runways:
* 9L/27R: 5,003 x 150 ft (1,525 x 46 m)
* 9R/27L: 6,000 x 150 ft (1,829 x 46 m)
* 13/31: 4,001 x 150 ft (1,220 x 46 m)

In the year ending 3 May 2018, the airport had 194,111 aircraft operations, average 531 per day: 99% general aviation, 1% air taxi and &lt;1% military. 135 aircraft were based at the airport: 104 single-engine, 17 multi-engine, 6 helicopter, 5 jet, and 3 glider.

==Services==
The airport serves as the primary airbase for the Miami-Dade Police Aviation Unit and is also home to the Miami-Dade College&#x27;s aviation programs. Additionally The Wings Over Miami aviation museum is located at the airport.

It is the base for the Tamiami Composite Squadron (SER-FL-355), a local unit of the Civil Air Patrol(United States Air Force Auxiliary), which is tasked with aerial and ground search and rescue missions.

Fire protection at the airport is provided by station 24 of the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department

==Runway 9R/27L extension==
A request for $1-million was added to the 2007 Miami-Dade Federal Legislative Package to extend runway 9R/27L 550 feet to the east and 1,798 feet to the west to &quot;...allow aircraft to increase their fuel and/or cargo load and ... allow for the accommodation of nearly 100 percent of midsize jet aircraft under wet runway conditions.&quot;

==Ohio University all-season test facility==
Ohio University Avionics Engineering Center operates a controversial avionics test facility on Runway 9L, the north runway at Miami Executive Airport. This facility was used in 2007–8 to certify the steep approach landing system on the Embraer ERJ-170 and ERJ-190 transport category jet airliners. Embraer conducted this testing and software development in order to meet stringent requirements and approval to land at London City Airport, an airport in central London, England. The test facility was under intense scrutiny due to numerous controversial test flights involving the challenging development and modifications to the fly-by-wire flight control systems in these advanced aircraft.

Testing of experimental aircraft over congested areas such as Kendall is prohibited by the FAA. Media coverage in the Miami Herald and Kendall Gazette about the safety issues led the Kendall Federation of Homeowners Associations to call for a meeting to discuss the problem.

== Incidents and accidents ==
* On November 29, 1978, a Convair CV-240 crashed when the trainee pilot lost control during a simulated engine failure at V2 speed during takeoff. The aircraft touched down left of the runway and wound up in a canal, catching fire and killing one of the two people on board.
* On February 11, 2015, a Beechcraft 1900C operated by Aeropanamericano, C.A., experienced an engine failure after takeoff from Miami Executive Airport and attempted to return but crashed, killing all four people on board.

<doc id="388782" wikidata="Q1816328" url="?curid=388782" title="Ospedale della Pietà">
<text>The Ospedale della Pietà was a convent, orphanage, and music school in Venice. Like other Venetian &quot;ospedali&quot;, the Pietà was first established as a hospice for the needy. A group of Venetian nuns, called the Consorelle di Santa Maria dell’Umiltà, established this charitable institution for orphans and abandoned girls in the fourteenth century. 

By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Pietà – along with the three other charitable Ospedali Grandi – was well known for its all-female musical ensembles that attracted tourists and patrons from around Europe. 

Its fame is largely connected to its resident composer and violin teacher Antonio Vivaldi.

==Musical activity==
Infants could be left at the Pietà via the &quot;scaffetta&quot;, a window only large enough to admit infants. Not all infants were female, nor were they necessarily orphans. Through the seventeenth century all four of the surviving &quot;ospedali&quot; gained increasing attention through the performances of sacred music by their female musicians, known as &quot;figlie di coro&quot;. Formal rules for the training of &quot;figlie&quot; were carefully drafted and periodically revised. Many of these concerts were given for select audiences consisting of important visitors. The audience was separated from the performers by a metal grill, following the example of convents to protect the women from the gaze of the visitors. As the institution became celebrated, it sometimes received infants related (not always legitimately) to members of the nobility. In the later decades of the Venetian Republic, which collapsed in 1797, it also accepted adolescent music students – called &quot;figlie di spese&quot; – whose fees were paid by sponsoring foreign courts or dignitaries.

The Pietà produced many &quot;virtuose&quot; like the violinist Chiara della Pietà and the soprano vocalist Fortunata Cantora, as well as composers, such as Agata della Pietà, and at least two composers who made careers outside of the institutions: Anna Bon and Vincenta Da Ponte. The life of successful &quot;figlie&quot; was much coveted. Some were given lavish gifts by admirers, and many were offered periods of vacation in villas on the Italian mainland. Most remained there their entire lives, though as the Venetian economy declined in the eighteenth century, some left to make (usually advantageous) marriages. In this instance, the institution provided a future bride with a small dowry.

Each Ospedale Grande usually had an orchestra of at least thirty to forty musicians (La Pietà&#x27;s orchestra counted up to sixty), all females, and the institutions competed with each other by hiring the best musicians in the city, promoting high quality concerts. Through such activities. they provided countless commissions for violin and other instruments makers to provide for the maintenance and repair of such instruments. These artisans were named &quot;liuter del loco&quot;. The office of &quot;liuter del loco&quot; guaranteed a constant flow of income: curating the instruments of an entire orchestra was a burdensome activity which required the work of more than one person; instruments had to be picked up, continuously repaired because of breakage and ungluing from use, and sometimes instruments had to be built. The responsible violin maker also had to supply strings for the entire orchestra, keep an accounting book detailing all operations, and issue semi-annual or annual invoices. These invoices, or ‘policies’ as they were called at the time, were handwritten by the appointed violin maker and had to be approved by the &quot;maestre del coro&quot; or the maestro di cappella – who would usually be granted a discount – before being paid by the hospital administration. These ‘policies’ are not only a precious source of information for the study of an author (luthier) and his work, but they are also a valid tool to gather more information on the musical practice of the &quot;sonadori&quot; (players) of the time. There is also much information that can be gleaned from their organological study. For a reading of some of the most interesting invoices, we refer to the appendix of the book by Pio where some of them (the author has found and catalogued more than 110, totaling 400 pages) are listed in chronological order and cover the years from 1750 to 1810.

The composer Antonio Vivaldi was appointed a violin teacher in 1703 and served in various roles through 1715, and again from 1723 to 1740. Much of Vivaldi&#x27;s sacred vocal and instrumental music was written for performance at the Pietà. The conservatory of the Pietà hospital was the only hospital to remain active until approximately 1830. All the other hospitals completely closed their musical activity during the first years of the nineteenth century. From an instrument inventory dated 1790 we learn that during that year the Pietà hospital had still “four violins with used bows, four cellos, seventeen violins, two marine trumpets (these may have been &quot;violini in tromba marina&quot;), six small violas, two viola d’amore, two mandolines, two lutes, one theorbo, four hunting horns with accessories, two psalteries with harmonic box, two cymbals, three flutes, two big cymbals with spinets, six spinets&quot;.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s account of 1770 conveys his impressions but has been over-generalized as a description of the institution over an entire century. After describing how the performers were hidden behind metal grilles, he related in his &quot;Confessions&quot; (1770):

I have not an idea of anything so voluptuous and affecting as this music; the richness of the art, the exquisite taste of the vocal part, the excellence of the voices, the justness of the execution, everything in these delightful concerts concurs to produce an impression which certainly is not the mode, but from which I am of opinion no heart is secure.

He goes on to describe meeting the musicians.

The original building (shown above) is currently a hotel-restaurant complex (the Metropole). The nearby church of the Pietà was completed in 1761, two decades after the death of Vivaldi. The facade of the church was only completed in the early 20th century. An early childhood education center is still housed in the rear of the building complex behind the church. Most of this complex was donated to the Ospedale in the 1720s, enabling it to expand its activities. Some of Vivaldi&#x27;s premiere pupils, such as Anna Maria del Violino, were given individual rooms in these newly acquired buildings. It is possible that in the salon of one of them the famous concert for &quot;i conti del Nord&quot;, celebrated in a painting by Francesco Guardi, took place on January 22, 1782. Guardi&#x27;s painting is mistitled &quot;The Dinner and Ball in the Teatro San Benedetto&quot;.

<doc id="388783" wikidata="Q1096635" url="?curid=388783" title="Lantana">
<text>Lantana () is a genus of about 150 species of perennial flowering plants in the verbena family, Verbenaceae. They are native to tropical regions of the Americas and Africa but exist as an introduced species in numerous areas, especially in the Australian-Pacific region, South and Northeastern part of India. The genus includes both herbaceous plants and shrubs growing to tall. Their common names are shrub verbenas or lantanas. The generic name originated in Late Latin, where it refers to the unrelated &quot;Viburnum lantana&quot;.

Lantana&#x27;s aromatic flower clusters (called umbels) are a mix of red, orange, yellow, or blue and white florets. Other colors exist as new varieties are being selected. The flowers typically change color as they mature, resulting in inflorescences that are two- or three-colored.

&quot;Wild lantanas&quot; are plants of the unrelated genus &quot;Abronia&quot;, usually called &quot;sand-verbenas&quot;.

==Ecology==

Some species are invasive, and are considered to be noxious weeds, such as in South Asia, Southern Africa and Australia. In the United States, lantanas are invasive in the southeast, especially coastal regions of the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, and the Gulf Coast.
The spread of lantana is aided by the fact that their leaves are poisonous to most animals and thus avoided by herbivores, while their fruit is a delicacy for many birds, including the yellow-fronted white-eye of Vanuatu, the superb fairy-wren in Australia, the scaly-breasted munia, and the Mauritius bulbul in the Mascarenes; these distribute the seeds and thereby unwittingly contribute to the degradation of their home ecosystem.

Biological control of introduced lantanas has been attempted, without robust success. In Australia, about 30 insects have been introduced in an attempt to control the spread of lantanas, and this has caused problems of its own. The lantana bug (&quot;Aconophora compressa&quot;) for example is a species introduced in 1995 that feeds on dozens of plants, and not only has it failed to have a noticeable impact on the lantana population, it has even become a pest in horticulture, parasitizing the related fiddlewoods (&quot;Citharexylum&quot;). The small &quot;Lantana&quot;-feeding moths &quot;Epinotia lantana&quot; and &quot;Lantanophaga pusillidactyla&quot;, while not becoming pests, have nonetheless failed to stem the spread of the invasive weed, as has the lantana scrub-hairstreak butterfly (&quot;Strymon bazochii&quot;) which was introduced to control lantanas on the Hawaiian Islands.

Other Lepidoptera whose caterpillars feed on lantana species include the common splendid ghost moth (&quot;Aenetus ligniveren)&quot;, &quot;Aenetus scotti&quot;, &quot;Endoclita malabaricus&quot;, &quot;Hypercompe orsa&quot; and the setaceous Hebrew character (&quot;Xestia c-nigrum&quot;). The swamp wallaby (&quot;Wallabia bicolor&quot;) is one of the few mammals that eat lantana leaves without apparent ill effect.

Lantanas are useful as honey plants, and Spanish flag (&quot;L. camara&quot;), &quot;L. lilacina&quot; and &quot;L. trifolia&quot; are sometimes planted for this purpose, or in butterfly gardening. Butterflies which are attracted to lantana flowers are most notably Papilioninae (swallowtail and birdwing butterflies). Hesperiidae (skippers) and certain brush-footed butterflies (namely Danainae and Heliconiinae), as well as some Pieridae (e.g. cloudless sulphur, &quot;Phoebis sennae&quot;), Lycaenidae (e.g. the aforementioned lantana scrub-hairstreak), and Nymphalidae (e.g. &quot;Greta oto&quot;) also like to visit the plants&#x27; flowers. Consequently, as total eradication of &quot;Lantana&quot; seems often impossible, it may in many cases be better to simply remove plants with immature (green) fruit to prevent them from spreading.
Some weaverbirds such as the black-throated weaver (&quot;Ploceus benghalensis&quot;) and the streaked weaver (&quot;P. manyar&quot;) highly value &quot;Lantana&quot; flowers for decorating their nests. An ability to procure spectacular and innovative decorations appears to be desired by females, and consequently is an indicator of the males&#x27; fitness.

In Australia it has been found that removing Lantana from urban greenspaces can have negative impacts on bird diversity locally, as it provides refuge for species like the superb fairy (&quot;Malurus cyaneus&quot;) and silvereye (&quot;Zosterops lateralis&quot;) in the absence of native plant equivalents. There seems to be a density threshold in which too much Lantana (thus homogeneity in vegetation cover) can lead to a decrease in bird species richness or abundance.

&quot;Ceratobasidium cornigerum&quot; is a higher fungus which parasitizes &quot;Lantana&quot; among other plants. The sweet potato whitefly (&quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot;) is a common greenhouse pest and is often distributed with infested lantanas.

&quot;Lantana&quot; species, especially &quot;L. camara&quot;, contain pentacyclic triterpenoids that cause hepatotoxicity and photosensitivity when ingested by grazing animals such as sheep, goats, bovines, and horses. This has led to widespread livestock loss in the United States, South Africa, India, Mexico, and Australia.

==Uses==
&quot;Lantana&quot; species are widely cultivated for their flowers in tropical and subtropical environments and (as an annual plant) in temperate climates.

Most of the plants sold as lantana are either Spanish flag (species of section &quot;Lantana&quot; and their hybrids, including &quot;L. camara&quot;, &quot;L. depressa&quot;, &quot;L. hirsuta&quot;, &quot;L. horrida&quot;, &quot;L. splendens&quot;, &quot;L. strigocamara&quot;, etc.), or trailing lantana (&quot;L. montevidensis&quot;). Numerous cultivars of the Spanish flag exist, including &#x27;Irene&#x27;, &#x27;Christine&#x27; and &#x27;Dallas Red&#x27; (all tall-growing cultivars) and several recently introduced shorter ones. The shorter cultivars may flower more prolifically than the taller ones. &quot;Lantana montevidensis&quot; gives blue (or white) flowers all year round. Its foliage is dark green and has a distinct odor.

Although lantanas are generally hardy and, being somewhat toxic, usually rejected by herbivores, they may still become infested with pests.

The edibility of &quot;Lantana&quot; berries is contested. Some experts claim &quot;Lantana&quot; berries are edible when ripe though like many other kinds of fruit, they are mildly poisonous if eaten while still green. Other experts claim that experimental research indicates that both unripe and ripe &quot;Lantana&quot; berries are potentially lethal, despite the claims by others that ripe berries are not poisonous.

Extracts of &quot;Lantana camara&quot; may be used for protection of cabbage against the aphid &quot;Lipaphis erysimi&quot;.

Tribal people of the MM Hills in southern Karnataka, India, produce roughly 50 different types of furniture from lantana. It is considered a &quot;near match&quot; to the more highly-priced cane and bamboo, while being resistant to sun, rain, and termite damage.

<text>Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832), was a landmark case in which the United States Supreme Court vacated the conviction of Samuel Worcester and held that the Georgia criminal statute that prohibited non-Native Americans from being present on Native American lands without a license from the state was unconstitutional.
The opinion is most famous for its &quot;dicta&quot;, which laid out the relationship between tribes, state, and federal governments. It is considered to have built the foundations of the doctrine of tribal sovereignty in the United States.

==Background==
Samuel Austin Worcester was a missionary to the Cherokee, translator of the Bible, printer, and defender of the Cherokee&#x27;s sovereignty. He collaborated with Elias Boudinot in the American Southeast to establish the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot;, the first Native American newspaper.

During this period, the westward push of European-American settlers was continually encroaching on Cherokee territory, even after they had made some land cessions to the US government. With the help of Worcester and his sponsor, the American Board of missionaries made a plan to fight the encroachment by using the courts. They wanted to take a case to the U.S. Supreme Court to define the relationship between the federal and state governments, and establish the sovereignty of the Cherokee nation. 

Hiring William Wirt, a former U.S. Attorney General, the Cherokee argued their position before the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Georgia v. Tassel.&quot; The court granted a writ of error for a Cherokee convicted in a Georgia court for a murder occurring in Cherokee territory, though the state refused to accept the writ. 

In 1831, &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; case was dismissed by the court on technical grounds for lack of jurisdiction. In the latter&#x27;s majority opinion, Chief Justice Marshall described the Cherokee Nation as a &quot;domestic dependent nation&quot; with no rights binding on a state.

Worcester and eleven other missionaries met and published a resolution in protest of an 1830 Georgia law prohibiting all white men from living on Native American land without a state license. While the state law was an effort to restrict white settlement on Cherokee territory, Worcester reasoned that obeying the law would, in effect, be surrendering the sovereignty of the Cherokee Nation to manage their own territory. Once the law had taken effect, Governor George Rockingham Gilmer ordered the militia to arrest Worcester and the others who signed the document and refused to get a license.

After two series of trials, all eleven men were convicted and sentenced to four years of hard labor at the state penitentiary in Milledgeville. Nine accepted pardons, but Worcester and Elizur Butler declined their pardons, so the Cherokee could take the case to the Supreme Court. William Wirt argued the case, but Georgia refused to have a legal counsel represent it, because the state believed the Supreme Court did not have authority to hear the case.

==Decision==
Chief Justice John Marshall laid out in this opinion that the relationship between the Indian Nations and the United States is that of nations, consistent with the principles of the law of nations. He reasoned that the United States, in the character of the federal government, inherited the legal rights of The Crown. Those rights, he stated, included the sole right to negotiate with the Indian nations of North America, to the exclusion of all other European powers. This did not include the rights of possession to their land or political dominion over their laws. He acknowledged that the exercise of conquest and purchase can give political dominion, but those are in the hands of the federal government, and individual states had no authority in American Indian affairs. Georgia&#x27;s statute was therefore invalid.

Associate Justice Henry Baldwin dissented, stating that, in his opinion, the record was not properly returned upon the writ of error, and ought to have been returned by the State court of Georgia, and not by the clerk of the Court of Gwinnett County. As to the merits, he said that his opinion remained the same as was expressed by him in the case of the &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; in 1831.

Marshall&#x27;s language in &quot;Worcester&quot; may have been motivated by his regret that his earlier opinions in &quot;Fletcher v. Peck&quot; and &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot; had been used as a justification for Georgia&#x27;s actions. Joseph Story considered it similarly, writing in a letter to his wife dated March 4, 1832: &quot;Thanks be to God, the Court can wash their hands clean of the iniquity of oppressing the Indians and disregarding their rights.&quot;

==Enforcement==

In a popular quotation that is believed to be apocryphal, President Andrew Jackson reportedly responded: &quot;John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!&quot; This quotation first appeared twenty years after Jackson&#x27;s death in newspaper publisher Horace Greeley&#x27;s 1865 history of the U.S. Civil War, &quot;The American Conflict&quot;. It was reported in the press in March 1832 that Jackson was unlikely to aid in carrying out the court&#x27;s decision if his assistance were to be requested. In an April 1832 letter to John Coffee, Jackson wrote that &quot;the decision of the Supreme Court has fell still born, and they find that they cannot coerce Georgia to yield to its mandate.&quot; In a letter in March 1832, Virginia politician David Campbell reported a private conversation in which Jackson had &quot;sportively&quot; suggested calling on the Massachusetts state militia to enforce the order if the Supreme Court requested he intervene, because Jackson believed Northern partisans had brought about the court&#x27;s ruling.

The Court did not ask federal marshals to carry out the decision. &quot;Worcester&quot; thus imposed no obligations on Jackson; there was nothing for him to enforce, although Jackson&#x27;s political enemies conspired to find evidence, to be used in the forthcoming political election, to claim that he would refuse to enforce the &quot;Worcester&quot; decision. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, Supreme Court cases were to be remanded back down to the lower court for final execution of the Supreme Court&#x27;s judgment. The Supreme Court could only execute the final judgment in cases where the lower court failed to act on the Supreme Court&#x27;s directive. Shortly after the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling had been issued in March 1832, the court recessed for the term, and would not convene again for the following term until January 1833.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s March 3, 1832, ruling ordered that Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler be freed from prison. On March 17, Worcester&#x27;s lawyers petitioned the Georgia court to release Worcester, but the court refused. Over the following months, Worcester&#x27;s lawyers petitioned the newly elected governor of Georgia, Wilson Lumpkin, to offer an unconditional pardon, but Lumpkin declined on the basis that the federal government was overstepping its authority. At the same time, the federal government, under Secretary of War Lewis Cass, began an intensive campaign to secure a removal treaty with the Cherokee nation, which would render the Supreme Court decision and Worcester&#x27;s continued political imprisonment inconsequential. On November 6, Lumpkin delivered his annual message to the Georgia state legislature, announcing he would continue to resist the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision:

Eighteen days later, on November 24, the state of South Carolina issued an Ordinance of Nullification, a separate and unrelated attempt by a state to defy federal authority. This began a series of events known as the Nullification Crisis. In an effort to isolate Georgia from South Carolina, the Jackson administration changed course in their approach to the &quot;Worcester&quot; decision. Secretary of War Lewis Cass, U.S. Senator John Forsyth of Georgia, incoming Vice President Martin Van Buren, and Van Buren&#x27;s political allies of the Albany Regency began to lobby Lumpkin to offer a pardon, citing the probability that a removal treaty with the Cherokees could be achieved once Worcester and Butler were released from prison. To sustain his states&#x27; rights position, Lumpkin stipulated that Worcester and Butler had to petition for the pardon with an admission they had violated state law. The two missionaries at first refused, because the Supreme Court decision had ruled they had not broken any law. The two decided to continue their appeal once the Supreme Court convened in early 1833.

The national situation began to deteriorate in December. On December 8, Andrew Jackson issued a Nullification Proclamation, denouncing nullification in South Carolina, declaring secession to be unconstitutional, and proclaiming the United States government would resort to force if South Carolina did not back down. Further entreaties by Georgia politicians and representatives of the federal government convinced Worcester and Butler of the risk to the Cherokee nation if Georgia were to join South Carolina&#x27;s attempt at secession. Worcester and Butler began to reconsider their appeal to the Supreme Court.

On December 22, Georgia repealed the law under which Worcester and Butler were imprisoned, allowing them to petition for a pardon without having to take an oath to leave the state of Georgia or Cherokee land. On January 8, 1833, the missionaries petitioned for their pardon, but it did not contain an admission they had broken state law, and Lumpkin believed its wording was insulting to the state of Georgia. Representatives for both sides negotiated for a new letter to be drafted by the missionaries, which was delivered to Lumpkin the following day. In the final letter, Worcester and Butler appealed to the &quot;magnanimity of the State&quot; of Georgia to end their prison sentences. On January 14, Lumpkin issued a general proclamation, not a formal pardon. Worcester and Butler were freed from prison.

Two days later, on January 16, President Andrew Jackson sent a message to Congress requesting the military power to put down the South Carolina insurrection. This request would be granted in the form of the Force Bill. Worcester and Butler were criticized by supporters of the Nullification effort, accusing them of aiding Jackson&#x27;s effort to inaugurate war against South Carolina.

On January 19, Worcester and Butler arrived back at New Echota, the capital of the Cherokee Nation. In February, they sent a letter to the &quot;Missionary Herald&quot;, explaining that their abandonment of the Supreme Court case was &quot;not . . . from any change in our views, but on account of changing circumstances&quot;.

==Aftermath==
On December 29, 1835, members of the Cherokee nation signed the controversial removal treaty, the Treaty of New Echota, which was immediately protested by the large majority of the Cherokees. Samuel Worcester moved to the Cherokee nation&#x27;s western Indian Territory in 1836, after removal had commenced. Worcester resumed his ministry, continued translating the Bible into Cherokee, and established the first printing press in that part of the United States, working with the Cherokee to publish their newspaper.

In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book &quot;The Supreme Court in United States History&quot;, Charles Warren asserted that the sequence of events in the aftermath of the &quot;Worcester&quot; case allowed the Supreme Court to go from its lowest point in history in late 1832, to its strongest position in fifteen years by early 1833. In 2000, Justice Stephen Breyer observed that the Supreme Court was an &quot;obvious winner&quot; in the case once its judgment was enforced, but the Cherokee nation was the &quot;obvious loser&quot; since the judgment did not benefit them in any way. Because Jackson proceeded with Cherokee removal, &quot;Worcester&quot; did not aid indigenous rights at the time. Removal of the Cherokee nation would begin just three years after Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler were released from Georgia prison, and forced migration would commence via the Trail of Tears in 1838.

&quot;Worcester&quot; has been cited in several later opinions on the subject of tribal sovereignty in the United States. In 2022, the Court ruled on &quot;Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta&quot;, a case that resulted from the Court&#x27;s earlier decision in &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot; (2020) that the tribal lands in the eastern half of Oklahoma had never been disestablished by Congress, and as a result, crimes committed on tribal lands by Native Americans were considered to be covered by tribal and federal jurisdiction rather than the state. &quot;Castro-Huertra&quot; was decided to clarify that crimes committed by non-Native Americans on tribal lands would have simultaneous jurisdiction by both federal and state. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing the majority in &quot;Castro-Huetra&quot;, stated that &quot;the &quot;Worcester&quot;-era understanding of Indian country as separate from the State was abandoned later in the 1800s&quot;, based on both &quot;United States v. McBratney&quot; and &quot;Draper v. United States&quot;.

<text>In aircraft, an ejection seat or ejector seat is a system designed to rescue the pilot or other crew of an aircraft (usually military) in an emergency. In most designs, the seat is propelled out of the aircraft by an explosive charge or rocket motor, carrying the pilot with it. The concept of an ejectable escape crew capsule has also been tried (see B-58 Hustler). Once clear of the aircraft, the ejection seat deploys a parachute. Ejection seats are common on certain types of military aircraft.

==History==

A bungee-assisted escape from an aircraft took place in 1910. In 1916, Everard Calthrop, an early inventor of parachutes, patented an ejector seat using compressed air. Compression springs installed under the seat were tested.

The modern layout for an ejection seat was first introduced by Romanian inventor Anastase Dragomir in the late 1920s. The design featured a &quot;parachuted cell&quot; (a dischargeable chair from an aircraft or other vehicle). It was successfully tested on 25 August 1929 at the Paris-Orly Airport near Paris and in October 1929 at Băneasa, near Bucharest. Dragomir patented his &quot;catapult-able cockpit&quot; at the French Patent Office.

The design was perfected during World War II. Prior to this, the only means of escape from an incapacitated aircraft was to jump clear (&quot;bail out&quot;), and in many cases this was difficult due to injury, the difficulty of egress from a confined space, &quot;g&quot; forces, the airflow past the aircraft, and other factors.

The first ejection seats were developed independently during World War II by Heinkel and SAAB. Early models were powered by compressed air and the first aircraft to be fitted with such a system was the Heinkel He 280 prototype jet-engined fighter in 1940. One of the He 280 test pilots, Helmut Schenk, became the first person to escape from a stricken aircraft with an ejection seat on 13 January 1942 after his control surfaces iced up and became inoperative. The fighter was being used in tests of the Argus As 014 impulse jets for V-1 flying bomb development. It had its usual Heinkel HeS 8A turbojets removed, and was towed aloft from the &quot;Erprobungsstelle Rechlin&quot; central test facility of the Luftwaffe in Germany by a pair of Messerschmitt Bf 110C tugs in a heavy snow-shower. At , Schenk found he had no control, jettisoned his towline, and ejected. The He 280 was never put into production status. The first operational type built anywhere to provide ejection seats for the crew was the Heinkel He 219 &quot;Uhu&quot; night fighter in 1942.

In Sweden, a version using compressed air was tested in 1941. A gunpowder ejection seat was developed by Bofors and tested in 1943 for the Saab 21. The first test in the air was on a Saab 17 on 27 February 1944, and the first real use occurred by Lt. Bengt Johansson on 29 July 1946 after a mid-air collision between a J 21 and a J 22.

As the first operational military jet in late 1944 to ever feature one, the winner of the German &quot;Volksjäger&quot; &quot;people&#x27;s fighter&quot; home defense jet fighter design competition; the lightweight Heinkel He 162A &quot;Spatz&quot;, featured a new type of ejection seat, this time fired by an explosive cartridge. In this system, the seat rode on wheels set between two pipes running up the back of the cockpit. When lowered into position, caps at the top of the seat fitted over the pipes to close them. Cartridges, basically identical to shotgun shells, were placed in the bottom of the pipes, facing upward. When fired, the gases would fill the pipes, &quot;popping&quot; the caps off the end, and thereby forcing the seat to ride up the pipes on its wheels and out of the aircraft. By the end of the war, the Dornier Do 335 &quot;Pfeil&quot;—primarily from it having a rear-mounted engine (of the twin engines powering the design) powering a pusher propeller located at the aft end of the fuselage presenting a hazard to a normal &quot;bailout&quot; escape—and a few late-war prototype aircraft were also fitted with ejection seats.

After World War II, the need for such systems became pressing, as aircraft speeds were getting ever higher, and it was not long before the sound barrier was broken. Manual escape at such speeds would be impossible. The United States Army Air Forces experimented with downward-ejecting systems operated by a spring, but it was the work of James Martin and his company Martin-Baker that proved crucial.

The first live flight test of the Martin-Baker system took place on 24 July 1946, when fitter Bernard Lynch ejected from a Gloster Meteor Mk III jet. Shortly afterward, on 17 August 1946, 1st Sgt. Larry Lambert was the first live U.S. ejectee. Lynch demonstrated the ejection seat at the &quot;Daily Express&quot; Air Pageant in 1948, ejecting from a Meteor. Martin-Baker ejector seats were fitted to prototype and production aircraft from the late 1940s, and the first emergency use of such a seat occurred in 1949 during testing of the jet-powered Armstrong Whitworth A.W.52 experimental flying wing.

Early seats used a solid propellant charge to eject the pilot and seat by igniting the charge inside a telescoping tube attached to the seat. As aircraft speeds increased still further, this method proved inadequate to get the pilot sufficiently clear of the airframe. Increasing the amount of propellant risked damaging the occupant&#x27;s spine, so experiments with rocket propulsion began. In 1958, the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger was the first aircraft to be fitted with a rocket-propelled seat. Martin-Baker developed a similar design, using multiple rocket units feeding a single nozzle. The greater thrust from this configuration had the advantage of being able to eject the pilot to a safe height even if the aircraft was on or very near the ground.

In the early 1960s, deployment of rocket-powered ejection seats designed for use at supersonic speeds began in such planes as the Convair F-106 Delta Dart. Six pilots have ejected at speeds exceeding . The highest altitude at which a Martin-Baker seat was deployed was 57,000 ft (17,400 m) (from a Canberra bomber in 1958). Following an accident on 30 July 1966 in the attempted launch of a D-21 drone, two Lockheed M-21 crew members ejected at Mach 3.25 at an altitude of . The pilot was recovered successfully, but the launch control officer drowned after a water landing. Despite these records, most ejections occur at fairly low speeds and altitudes, when the pilot can see that there is no hope of regaining aircraft control before impact with the ground.

Late in the Vietnam War, the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy became concerned about its pilots ejecting over hostile territory and those pilots either being captured or killed and the losses in men and aircraft in attempts to rescue them. Both services began a program titled &quot;Air Crew Escape/Rescue Capability&quot; or &quot;Aerial Escape and Rescue Capability&quot; (AERCAB) ejection seats (both terms have been used by the US military and defence industry), where after the pilot ejected, the ejection seat would fly them to a location far enough away from where they ejected to where they could safely be picked up. A Request for Proposals for concepts for AERCAB ejection seats were issued in the late 1960s. Three companies submitted papers for further development: A Rogallo wing design by Bell Systems; a gyrocopter design by Kaman Aircraft; and a mini-conventional fixed wing aircraft employing a Princeton Wing (i.e. a wing made of flexible material that rolls out and then becomes rigid by means of internal struts or supports etc. deploying) by Fairchild Hiller. All three, after ejection, would be propelled by small turbojet engine developed for target drones. With the exception of the Kaman design, the pilot would still be required to parachute to the ground after reaching a safety-point for rescue. The AERCAB project was terminated in the 1970s with the end of the Vietnam War. The Kaman design, in early 1972, was the only one which was to reach the hardware stage. It came close to being tested with a special landing-gear platform attached to the AERCAB ejection seat for first-stage ground take offs and landings with a test pilot.

==Pilot safety==


The purpose of an ejection seat is pilot survival. The pilot typically experiences an acceleration of about 12–14g. Western seats usually impose lighter loads on the pilots; 1960s–70s era Soviet technology often goes up to 20–22 &quot;g&quot; (with SM-1 and KM-1 gunbarrel-type ejection seats). Compression fractures of vertebrae are a recurrent side effect of ejection.

It was theorised early on that ejection at supersonic speeds would be unsurvivable; extensive tests, including Project Whoosh with chimpanzee test subjects, were undertaken to determine that it was feasible.

The capabilities of the NPP Zvezda K-36 were unintentionally demonstrated at the Fairford Air Show on 24 July 1993 when the pilots of two MiG-29 fighters ejected after a mid-air collision.

The minimal ejection altitude for ACES II seat in inverted flight is about above ground level at 150 KIAS, while the Russian counterpart – K-36DM has the minimal ejection altitude from inverted flight of AGL.
When an aircraft is equipped with the NPP Zvezda K-36DM ejection seat and the pilot is wearing the КО-15 protective gear, they are able to eject at airspeeds from 0 to and altitudes of 0 to 25 km (16 mi or about 82,000 ft). The K-36DM ejection seat features drag chutes and a small shield that rises between the pilot&#x27;s legs to deflect air around the pilot.

Pilots have successfully ejected from underwater in a handful of instances, after being forced to ditch in water. The first recorded case was Lt. B. D. Macfarlane of the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm when he successfully ejected under water using his Martin-Baker Mk.1 ejection seat after his Westland Wyvern had ditched on launch and been cut in two by the carrier on 13 October 1954. Documented evidence also exists that pilots of the US and Indian navies have also performed this feat.

 – when two Spanish Air Force pilots ejected over San Javier airport – the number of lives saved by Martin-Baker products was 7,402 from 93 air forces. The company runs a club called the &quot;Ejection Tie Club&quot; and gives survivors a unique tie and lapel pin. The total figure for all types of ejection seats is unknown, but may be considerably higher.

Early models of the ejection seat were equipped with only an overhead ejection handle which doubled in function by forcing the pilot to assume the right posture and by having them pull a screen down to protect both their face and oxygen mask from the subsequent air blast. Martin Baker added a secondary handle in the front of the seat to allow ejection even when pilots weren&#x27;t able to reach upwards because of high g-force. Later (e.g. in Martin Baker&#x27;s MK9) the top handle was discarded because the lower handle had proven easier to operate and the technology of helmets had advanced to also protect from the air blast.

==Egress systems==

The &quot;standard&quot; ejection system operates in two stages. First, the entire canopy or hatch above the aviator is opened, shattered, or jettisoned, and the seat and occupant are launched through the opening. In most earlier aircraft this required two separate actions by the aviator, while later egress system designs, such as the Advanced Concept Ejection Seat model 2 (ACES II), perform both functions as a single action.

The ACES II ejection seat is used in most American-built fighters. The A-10 uses connected firing handles that activate both the canopy jettison systems, followed by the seat ejection. The F-15 has the same connected system as the A-10 seat. Both handles accomplish the same task, so pulling either one suffices. The F-16 has only one handle located between the pilot&#x27;s knees, since the cockpit is too narrow for side-mounted handles.

Non-standard egress systems include Downward Track (used for some crew positions in bomber aircraft, including the B-52 Stratofortress), Canopy Destruct (CD) and Through-Canopy Penetration (TCP), Drag Extraction, Encapsulated Seat, and even Crew Capsule.

Early models of the F-104 Starfighter were equipped with a Downward Track ejection seat due to the hazard of the T-tail. In order to make this work, the pilot was equipped with &quot;spurs&quot; which were attached to cables that would pull the legs inward so the pilot could be ejected. Following this development, some other egress systems began using leg retractors as a way to prevent injuries to flailing legs, and to provide a more stable center of gravity. Some models of the F-104 were equipped with upward-ejecting seats.

Similarly, two of the six ejection seats on the B-52 Stratofortress fire downward, through hatch openings on the bottom of the aircraft; the downward hatches are released from the aircraft by a thruster that unlocks the hatch, while gravity and wind remove the hatch and arm the seat. The four seats on the forward upper deck (two of them, EWO and Gunner, facing the rear of the airplane) fire upwards as usual. Any such downward-firing system is of no use on or near the ground if aircraft is in level flight at the time of the ejection.

Aircraft designed for low-level use sometimes have ejection seats which fire through the canopy, as waiting for the canopy to be ejected is too slow. Many aircraft types (e.g., the BAE Hawk and the Harrier line of aircraft) use Canopy Destruct systems, which have an explosive cord (MDC – Miniature Detonation Cord or FLSC – Flexible Linear Shaped Charge) embedded within the acrylic plastic of the canopy. The MDC is initiated when the eject handle is pulled, and shatters the canopy over the seat a few milliseconds before the seat is launched. This system was developed for the Hawker Siddeley Harrier family of VTOL aircraft as ejection may be necessary while the aircraft was in the hover, and jettisoning the canopy might result in the pilot and seat striking it. This system is also used in the T-6 Texan II and F-35 Lightning II.

Through-Canopy Penetration is similar to Canopy Destruct, but a sharp spike on the top of the seat, known as the &quot;shell tooth&quot;, strikes the underside of the canopy and shatters it. The A-10 Thunderbolt II is equipped with canopy breakers on either side of its headrest in the event that the canopy fails to jettison. The T-6 is also equipped with such breakers if the MDC fails to detonate. In ground emergencies, a ground crewman or pilot can use a breaker knife attached to the inside of the canopy to shatter the transparency. The A-6 Intruder and EA-6B Prowler seats were capable of ejecting through the canopy, with canopy jettison a separate option if there is enough time.

CD and TCP systems cannot be used with canopies made of flexible materials, such as the Lexan polycarbonate canopy used on the F-16.

Soviet VTOL naval fighter planes such as the Yakovlev Yak-38 were equipped with ejection seats which were automatically activated during at least some part of the flight envelope.

Drag Extraction is the lightest and simplest egress system available, and has been used on many experimental aircraft. Halfway between simply &quot;bailing out&quot; and using explosive-eject systems, Drag Extraction uses the airflow past the aircraft (or spacecraft) to move the aviator out of the cockpit and away from the stricken craft on a guide rail. Some operate like a standard ejector seat, by jettisoning the canopy, then deploying a drag chute into the airflow. That chute pulls the occupant out of the aircraft, either with the seat or following release of the seat straps, who then rides off the end of a rail extending far enough out to help clear the structure. In the case of the Space Shuttle, the astronauts would have ridden a long, curved rail, blown by the wind against their bodies, then deployed their chutes after free-falling to a safe altitude.

Encapsulated Seat egress systems were developed for use in the B-58 Hustler and B-70 Valkyrie supersonic bombers. These seats were enclosed in an air-operated clamshell, which permitted the aircrew to escape at airspeeds and altitudes high enough to otherwise cause bodily harm. These seats were designed to allow the pilot to control the plane even with the clamshell closed, and the capsule would float in case of water landings.

Some aircraft designs, such as the General Dynamics F-111, do not have individual ejection seats, but instead, the entire section of the airframe containing the crew can be ejected as a single capsule. In this system, very powerful rockets are used, and multiple large parachutes are used to bring the capsule down, in a manner similar to the Launch Escape System of the Apollo spacecraft. On landing, an airbag system is used to cushion the landing, and this also acts as a flotation device if the Crew Capsule lands in water.

===Zero-zero ejection seat===
A zero-zero ejection seat is designed to safely extract upward and land its occupant from a grounded stationary position (i.e., zero altitude and zero airspeed), specifically from aircraft cockpits. The zero-zero capability was developed to help aircrews escape upward from unrecoverable emergencies during low-altitude and/or low-speed flight, as well as ground mishaps. Parachutes require a minimum altitude for opening, to give time for deceleration to a safe landing speed. Thus, prior to the introduction of zero-zero capability, ejections could only be performed above minimum altitudes and airspeeds. If the seat was to work from zero (aircraft) altitude, the seat would have to lift itself to a sufficient altitude.

These early seats were fired from the aircraft with a cannon, providing the high impulse needed over the very short length on the cannon barrel within the seat. This limited the total energy, and thus the additional height possible, as otherwise the high forces needed would crush the pilot.

Modern zero-zero technology use small rockets to propel the seat upward to an adequate altitude and a small explosive charge to open the parachute canopy quickly for a successful parachute descent, so that proper deployment of the parachute no longer relies on airspeed and altitude. The seat cannon clears the seat from the aircraft, then the under-seat rocket pack fires to lift the seat to altitude. As the rockets fire for longer than the cannon, they do not require the same high forces. Zero-zero rocket seats also reduced forces on the pilot during any ejection, reducing injuries and spinal compression.

==Other vehicles==
The Kamov Ka-50 and its successor, the Kamov Ka-52, were the first and only serial production helicopters with ejection seats. The system is similar to that of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft; however the main rotors are equipped with explosive bolts to jettison the blades moments before the seat is fired, preventing the pilots being gored to death by them.

The only commercial jetliner ever fitted with ejection seats was the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144. However, the seats were present in the prototype only, and were only available for the crew and not the passengers. The Tu-144 that crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1973 was a production model, and did not have ejection seats.

The Lunar Landing Research Vehicle, (LLRV) and its successor Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV), used ejection seats. Neil Armstrong ejected on 6 May 1968, following Joe Algranti and Stuart M. Present.

The only spacecraft ever flown with installed ejection seats were Vostok, Gemini, and the Space Shuttle.

Early flights of the Space Shuttle, which used &quot;Columbia&quot;, were with a crew of two, both provided with ejector seats (STS-1 to STS-4), but the seats were disabled and then removed as the crew size was increased. &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; were the only two Space Shuttle orbiters fitted with ejection seats. The Buran-class orbiters were planned to be fitted with K-36RB (K-36M-11F35) seats, but as the program was canceled, the seats were never used.

No real life land vehicle has ever been fitted with an ejection seat, though it is a common trope in fiction. A notable example is the Aston Martin DB5 from the James Bond films, which had an ejecting passenger seat.

<text>Charles Edward Taylor (May 24, 1868 – January 30, 1956) was an American inventor, mechanic and machinist. He built the first aircraft engine used by the Wright brothers in the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;, and was a vital contributor of mechanical skills in the building and maintaining of early Wright engines and airplanes.

==Biography==
He was born in a log cabin on May 24, 1868, in Cerro Gordo, Illinois, to William Stephen Taylor and Mary Jane Germain. Taylor worked as a binder at the &quot;Nebraska State Journal&quot; at age 12, later becoming a tool maker. At 24, he met and married Henrietta Webbert, who was from Dayton, Ohio. They had a child and moved to Dayton, where prospects were better. Stoddard Manufacturing Co. hired him to make farm machinery and bicycles. But when the Wright brothers began renting from his wife&#x27;s uncle a building for their bicycle shop, he went to work for them. Initially, Taylor was hired to fix bicycles, but increasingly took over running of the bicycle business as the Wright brothers spent more time on their aeronautical pursuits. By 1902, they trusted him enough to run the shop in their absence while they went to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to fly gliders.

When it became clear that an off-the-shelf engine with the required power-to-weight ratio was not available in the U.S. for their first engine-driven Flyer, the Wrights turned to Taylor for the job. He designed and built the aluminum-copper, water-cooled, four-cylinder aircraft engine in only six weeks, based partly on rough sketches provided by the Wrights. The cast aluminum block and crankcase weighed and were produced at either Miami Brass Foundry or the Buckeye Iron and Brass Works, near Dayton, Ohio. The Wrights needed an engine with at least . The engine that Taylor built produced .

In 1908 Taylor helped Orville build and prepare the &quot;military Flyer&quot; for demonstration to the U.S. Army at Fort Myer, Virginia. On September 17, the airplane crashed due to a shattered propeller, seriously injuring Orville and killing his passenger, Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge. Taylor was among the first to reach the crash. He helped lift Selfridge out of the wreckage, then undid Orville&#x27;s necktie and opened his shirt as doctors in the crowd pushed their way to the scene. Orville and Selfridge were taken away on stretchers. After that,

Charlie leaned against an upended wing of the wrecked Flyer, buried his face in his arms, and sobbed. A newspaperman tried to comfort him, but he was past comforting until Dr. Watters assured him that the chances for Orville&#x27;s recovery were good. Then he pulled himself together and took charge of carting the wrecked Flyer back to its shed.

Both Taylor and Navy Lieutenant George Sweet had been scheduled to make their first flights with Orville that day, but both were bumped in order to accommodate Selfridge who had to leave town shortly for Missouri. Despite this accident, Taylor wanted to become a pilot and sought Wilbur and Orville to teach him. The Wrights, reluctant to lose Taylor&#x27;s services to the world of exhibition flying, discouraged him.

In September, 1909 Taylor accompanied Wilbur, with a new Model A Flyer, to Governor&#x27;s Island, New York City. Wilbur was to make several over-water flights at the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, demonstrating the airplane to millions of New Yorkers and showcasing the new technology of practical flight. Charlie ably assisted Wilbur, though he did not fly with him. Charlie made sure the engine worked perfectly for the daring and dangerous over-water trips. The pair also installed a watertight canoe to the Flyer&#x27;s lower wing for buoyancy just in case of an emergency landing in the Hudson River.

Taylor became a leading mechanic in the Wright Company after it was formed in 1909. When Calbraith Perry Rodgers made his trip from Long Island to California in 1911 in his newly bought Wright aircraft, he paid Taylor $70 a week (a large sum at the time) to be his mechanic. Taylor followed the flight by train, frequently arriving at the next rendezvous before Rodgers, to make any required repairs and prepare the aircraft for the next day&#x27;s flight.

Taylor worked for the Wright-Martin Company in Dayton until 1920. He later moved to California and invested his life savings in several hundred acres of real estate near the Salton Sea, but the venture failed. He returned to Dayton in 1936, and he and Orville helped Henry Ford in the planning, moving and restoration of the Wright family home and one of the Wright brothers&#x27; bicycle shops to Ford&#x27;s Dearborn, Michigan, heritage village about great Americans. Orville also gave Taylor an annuity of $800 a year.

In 1941 Taylor returned to California, finding work in a defense factory. He had a heart attack in 1945 and was no longer able to work. By 1955 his annuity and Social Security income were inadequate and due to his health problems he ended up in the charity ward of the Los Angeles County Hospital. When his destitute plight was publicized by a reporter who found him, the aviation industry raised funds to move him into a private facility.

He died from complications of asthma in San Fernando on January 30, 1956 - eight years to the day after Orville, his friend and employer. Taylor is buried at the Portal of Folded Wings Shrine to Aviation in Burbank, California, a shrine to aviation history.

==Legacy==
*The FAA&#x27;s Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award is named in his honor.
*The Charles Taylor Aviation Maintenance Science Department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is named for him.
*Aviation Maintenance Technician Day is observed in 45 U.S. states on May 24, Taylor&#x27;s birthday.
*Posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1965.
*FAA mechanic certificates now feature Taylor&#x27;s image rather than the images of the Wright brothers they previously featured, in common with airmen certificates.

<text>James Hardiman (February 1782 – 13 November 1855), also known as Séamus Ó hArgadáin, was a librarian at Queen&#x27;s College, Galway and an important historian.

Hardiman is best remembered for his &quot;History of the Town and County of Galway&quot; (1820) and &quot;Irish Minstrelsy&quot; (1831), one of the first published collections of Irish poetry and songs.

==Biography==
Hardiman was born in Westport, County Mayo, in the west of Ireland. His father owned a small estate in County Mayo. He was trained as a lawyer and became sub-commissioner of public records in Dublin Castle. He was an active member of the Royal Irish Academy, and collected and rescued many examples of Irish traditional music.

In 1855, shortly after its foundation, Hardiman became librarian of Queen&#x27;s College, Galway.

==Eponyms==
The University of Galway (formerly Queen&#x27;s College Galway) library was named in his honour.

Hardiman Road in Drumcondra, Dublin is named after him.

The Hardiman hotel in Galway is named after him.

<doc id="389358" wikidata="Q1658724" url="?curid=389358" title="Swinhoe's storm petrel">
<text>Swinhoe&#x27;s storm petrel or Swinhoe&#x27;s petrel (Hydrobates monorhis) is a small, all-brown seabird of the storm petrel family Hydrobatidae.

==Etymology==
The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek. &quot;Hydrobates&quot; is from &quot;hydro&quot; &#x27;water&#x27;, and &quot;bates&quot; &#x27;walker&#x27;, and &quot;monorhis&quot; is from &quot;monos&quot; &#x27;single&#x27; and &quot;rhinos&quot; &#x27;nostril&#x27;. The common name commemorates the British naturalist Robert Swinhoe, who first described the species in 1867.

It was formerly defined in the genus &quot;Oceanodroma&quot; before that genus was synonymized with &quot;Hydrobates&quot;.

==Distribution==
It breeds on islands in the northwest Pacific off the Russian Far East, China, Japan and Korea. It nests in colonies close to the sea in rock crevices and lays a single white egg. It spends the rest of the year at sea, ranging into the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea.

It breeds on Verkhovsky Island (7,500 pairs), south of Vladivostok, Russia, and Japan (a minimum of 1,000 pairs). There are little-known populations in China, Taiwan, North Korea and South Korea, and records suggest that breeding may also occur in the North Atlantic. In winter, it migrates south and west to the northern Indian Ocean (Brooke 2004). Sato et al. (2010) also estimate the world population at a minimum of 130,000 pairs, confirming that the species has a very large population. However, Birds Korea (2010) state that c. 100,000 pairs nest on Gugeul Islet, implying that possibly over 75% of the global population breed on one very small island. The species nests at six or seven breeding islets in South Korea (Chang-Yong Choi in litt. 2012). There is apparently anecdotal evidence that some colonies are in decline (N. Moores in litt. 2011).

==Description==
Swinhoe&#x27;s storm petrel is a small bird, 18–21 cm in length with a 45–48 cm wingspan, though distinctly larger than the European storm petrel. It is essentially dark brown in all plumages, and has a fluttering flight, pattering on the water surface as it picks planktonic food items from the ocean surface. Unlike the European storm petrel, it does not follow ships.

In structure it most resembles a Leach&#x27;s storm petrel with its forked tail, longish wings, and flight behaviour, but does not have a white rump and the call differs. It is difficult to distinguish from other all-dark &quot;Hydrobates&quot; species, and the first English record had to be DNA-tested to eliminate the possibility that it was a Leach&#x27;s storm petrel, since populations of north-eastern Pacific Leach&#x27;s storm petrels contain individuals that show completely dark rumps.

==Habits and observation==
This storm petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls and skuas, and will even avoid coming to land on clear moonlit nights. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. It is strictly pelagic outside the breeding season, and this, together with its remote breeding sites, makes Swinhoe&#x27;s petrel a difficult bird to see from land. Only in storms might this species be pushed into headlands, but even then an out of range bird would probably defy definite identification. It feeds mainly on the wing by dipping and does not patter.

==Status==
Widespread throughout its large range, the Swinhoe&#x27;s storm petrel was previously evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, but was uplisted to near threatened in 2012. The population is expected to undergo a moderately rapid decline over the next three generations, owing primarily to the impact of introduced species.

==North Atlantic status==
On 8 July 1983, a bird was trapped on the Selvagens, Madeira, and was confirmed to be the first record for the Atlantic Ocean. Since then a number of storm petrels exhibiting plumage and structural characteristics have been recorded at sea, principally in the North Atlantic, while birds were trapped during the summer months in France (1989), England (1989 (two birds), 1990 (with birds retrapped from 1991 to 1994)), Spain (1994), Norway (1996, 1997), and again Madeira (1991, 1994). Other than the east North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea a number of other individuals have been identified in the western North Atlantic. Records of single birds off Hatteras, North Carolina, on 20 August 1993, on 8 August 1998, and 2 June 2008 have all been accepted as valid North American records.

<text>John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl (died 25 April 1579), called the Fair, was a Scottish nobleman and courtier. He was favoured by Mary, Queen of Scots, but later turned against her.

==Biography==
Stewart was the son of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Atholl and Grizel Rattray.

He supported the government of the queen dowager Mary of Guise. He wrote to her on 10 June 1554 describing a skirmish in which his cousin George Drummond of Ledcrieff was killed by the lairds of Ardblair, Drumlochie, and Gormok, his followers. Lord Ruthven, sheriff of Perth, and Lord Drummond had searched for these lairds in vain but arrested six innocent poor men, who also depended on him. He hoped she could arrange a fair trial for them in Edinburgh or Perth, especially because Lord Ruthven favoured the Drummonds. He was coming to see her, but had fallen ill and wrote from Tullibardine. Subsequently, Patrick Blair of Ardblair was found, tried, and beheaded for the murder.

In 1560 he was one of the three nobles who voted in Parliament against the Reformation and the confession of faith, and declared their adherence to Roman Catholicism. Subsequently, however, he joined the league against the Earl of Huntly, whom with Murray and Morton he defeated at Corrichie in October 1562, and he supported the projected marriage of Elizabeth I with Arran.

On the arrival of Mary, Queen of Scots, from France in 1561 he was appointed one of the twelve privy councillors, and on account of his religion obtained a greater share the queen&#x27;s favour than either Murray or Maitland. He was one of the principal supporters of the marriage with Lord Darnley, became the leader of the Roman Catholic nobles, and with John Knox obtained the chief power in the government, successfully protecting Mary and Darnley from Murray&#x27;s attempts to regain his ascendancy by force of arms. According to Knox he openly attended mass in the queen&#x27;s chapel, and was especially trusted by Mary in her project of reinstating Roman Catholicism. The fortress of Tantallon was placed in his keeping, and in 1565 he was made lieutenant of the north of Scotland. He was described the same year by the French ambassador as &quot;très grand catholique hardi et vaillant et remuant, comme l&#x27;on dict, mais de nul&quot;.

After the murder of David Rizzio in 1567, he joined the Protestant lords against Mary, appeared as one of the leaders against her at Carberry Hill, and afterwards approved of her imprisonment at Lochleven Castle. In July he was present at the coronation of James VI, and was included in the council of regency to Mary&#x27;s abdication. He, however, was not present at the battle of Langside in May 1568, and in July became once more a supporter of Mary, voting for her divorce from Bothwell (1569). In March 1570 he formed with other lords the joint letter to Elizabeth asking for the queen&#x27;s intercession and supporting Mary&#x27;s claims, and was present at the convention held at Linlithgow in April in opposition to the assembly of the king&#x27;s party at Edinburgh.

In 1574 he was proceeded against as a Roman Catholic and threatened with excommunication, subsequently holding a conference with the ministers and being allowed till midsummer to overcome his scruples. In October 1578 he stayed with Morton at Dalkeith Palace and was said to have converted to the Protestant faith.

He had failed in 1572 to prevent Morton&#x27;s appointment to the regency, but in 1578 he succeeded with the Earl of Argyll in driving him from office. On 24 March, James VI took the government into his own hands and dissolved the regency, and Atholl and Argyll, to the exclusion of Morton, were made members of the council, while on the 29th Atholl was appointed lord chancellor. Subsequently, on 24 May, Morton succeeded in getting into Stirling Castle and in attaining his guardianship of James. Atholl and Argyll, who were now corresponding with Spain in hopes of assistance from that quarter, then advanced to Stirling with a large force, when a compromise was arranged, the three earls being all included in the government.

==Death==
While on his way from a banquet held on 20 April 1579 at Stirling Castle on the occasion of the reconciliation, Atholl was seized with sudden illness, and despite the attentions of the court physicians Gilbert Moncreiff and Alexander Preston, and a Highland practitioner recorded as the &quot;Irland Leeche&quot;, he died on 25 April at Kincardine.

He was buried at the High Kirk of Edinburgh near the tomb of Regent Moray at the request of the King.

There was a strong suspicion of poisoning and his relatives, including William Stewart of Grandtully, complained to James VI. Some suspected Regent Morton or Annabell Murray, Countess of Mar. Rumours that he was poisoned with the Earl of Montrose, who survived, spread in England.

Regent Morton&#x27;s friend George Auchinleck of Balmanno was tortured with the boot on 15 March 1580 and was said to have confessed that Morton had Atholl poisoned. Affleck blamed another captive associate of Morton, Sanders Jordan, (Alexander Jardine). It was thought that John Provand had provided the poison.

<doc id="389363" wikidata="Q973179" url="?curid=389363" title="Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan">
<text>The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU; ; ) was a militant Islamist group formed in 1998 by Islamic ideologue Tahir Yuldashev and former Soviet paratrooper Juma Namangani; both ethnic Uzbeks from the Fergana Valley. Its original objective was to overthrow President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan and create an Islamic state under Sharia; however, in subsequent years, it reinvented itself as an ally of Al-Qaeda. The group also maintained relations with Afghan Taliban in 1990s. However, later on, relations between the Afghan Taliban and the IMU started declining.

Operating out of bases in Tajikistan and Taliban-controlled areas of northern Afghanistan, the IMU launched a series of raids into southern Kyrgyzstan in the years 1999 and 2000. The IMU suffered heavy casualties in 2001–2002 during the American-led invasion of Afghanistan. Namangani was killed, while Yuldeshev and many of the IMU&#x27;s remaining fighters escaped with remnants of the Taliban to Waziristan, in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. The IMU then focused on fighting the Pakistan Forces in the Tribal Areas, and NATO and Afghan forces in northern Afghanistan.

In mid-2015, its leadership publicly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and announced that the IMU was part of the group&#x27;s regional branch. In 2016, it was reported that a new faction of Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan emerged after the group became part of ISIL. The new faction retained the group&#x27;s name and was independent of ISIL. It has also indicated that it is loyal to al-Qaeda and the Taliban and shared their views against ISIL.

==Background==
During the Soviet era, Islam in Central Asia was officially suppressed – mosques were closed, and all contact with the wider Muslim world was severed. This isolation ended with the Soviet–Afghan War (1979–1989), when thousands of conscripts from Soviet Central Asia were sent to fight the Afghan mujahedin. Many of these conscripts returned home impressed by the Islamic zeal of their opponents, and newly aware of the religious, cultural and linguistic characteristics they shared with their neighbours in the South; and which distinguished them from their rulers in Moscow.

===Adolat (1991–1992)===
One such soldier sent to fight in Afghanistan was the Uzbek paratrooper Juma Namangani (born 1969). Following the war, Khojayev returned to his hometown of Namangan in Uzbekistan&#x27;s Fergana Valley radicalized by his experiences, and became associated with a local Islamic ideologue, Tohir Yuldashev (born 1967). In the period of initial instability that followed Uzbekistan&#x27;s sudden independence in 1991, Yuldeshev and Khojayev (now adopting the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Juma Namangani) established a radical Salafi Islamist group in Namangan which they called Adolat (Justice).

Adolat assumed civil authority in Namangan and quickly established a degree of order and security through the imposition of Sharia Law, which was ruthlessly enforced by Adolat&#x27;s vigilante cadres. Initially tolerated by the newly installed President Karimov, Adolat became increasingly assertive, culminating in a demand that Karimov impose Sharia throughout Uzbekistan. However, by 1992 Karimov had successfully cemented his authority in Tashkent, and was strong enough to outlaw Adolat and re-establish central control over the Fergana Valley region – traditionally one of the most Islamic regions in Central Asia.

===Tajik civil war (1992–1997)===
Evading arrest, Yuldashev and Namagani fled to Tajikistan, where civil war was raging following a bloody but successful coup led by Emomali Rahmonov earlier in 1992. The civil war pitted Rahmonov&#x27;s neo-communist forces against a loose coalition of democrats and Islamists known as the United Tajik Opposition (UTO). The UTO was led by the widely popular and highly respected Islamist Said Abdullah Nuri, whose Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) advocated a moderate and democratic brand of Islamism.

Namangani&#x27;s combat experience in Afghanistan saw him entrusted by the IRPT with the command of active units in the field, based out of the remote, mountainous Tavildara Valley region. He enjoyed considerable success in this role. Meanwhile, Yuldashev left Tajikistan on a tour of Afghanistan, Turkey and the Middle East, during which time he developed contacts with numerous Islamist groups. From 1995 to 1998 Yuldashev was based in Peshawar in Pakistan, where he established relations with Osama bin Laden and the Afghan Arabs based there at the time.

===IMU formation (1998)===
In 1997 Rahmonov and Nuri signed a peace agreement which saw Rahmonov agree to sharing power with the IRPT. Disillusioned with the political concessions made by the Tajik Islamists, Yuldeshev and Namangani formed the IMU in 1998 with the aim of creating a militant Islamic opposition to Karimov in Uzbekistan. The IMU began moving towards the Afghan Taliban and away from their former and more moderate IRPT allies, who were in turn partially backing the ethnic-Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and his Northern Alliance against the Taliban.

Nevertheless, Namangani maintained his base in Tajikistan&#x27;s Tavildara Valley, and was able to recruit large numbers of disaffected youth from the Fergana Valley, where economic hardship and religious persecution were continuing under Karimov&#x27;s authoritarian rule.

==History==

===Initial operations in Central Asia===

In 1999 a series of explosions in the capital Tashkent were orchestrated in an unsuccessful attempt on Karimov&#x27;s life. Karimov placed the blame on the Islamists and the IMU in particular; however this attribution remains disputed, and it is possible the assassination attempt was the work of rival political and regional elites. Irrespective of who was responsible, the result was an escalation in Karimov&#x27;s suppression of Islam, particularly in the traditionally observant Fergana Valley – a move which only increased the number of those fleeing Uzbekistan to join up with Namangani and the IMU in the Tavildara Valley.

Later that year the IMU conducted its first verifiable operations, with an incursion into the Batken region of southern Kyrgyzstan, a region populated mainly by ethnic Uzbeks that is between Tavildara in Tajikistan and the Fergana Valley in Uzbekistan. Insurgents seized the Mayor of Osh (the regional capital) and successfully extorted a ransom from the ill-prepared Kyrgyz government in Bishkek, as well as a helicopter to transport them to Afghanistan. Further incursions into Batken followed, with one raid resulted in a number of Japanese geologists kidnapped. Although denied by Japan, their subsequent release was reported to have followed the payment of a significant ransom.

These raids had a major impact in Central Asia, and resulted in considerable international pressure on Tajikistan, not least from Karimov, to expel the IMU from its base in the Tavildara Valley. The IRPT persuaded their former ally Namangani to abandon Tavildara in late 1999. Controversially, Namangani and his fighters were then flown from Tajikistan to northern Afghanistan in Russian military helicopters, a move which enraged Karimov who claimed the Russians were aiding the IMU in an attempt to undermine Uzbekistan.

===Expansion into Taliban-ruled Afghanistan===
In Afghanistan Yuldeshev was able to exploit the contacts he had made on his earlier travels to negotiate freedom of operation from the Taliban, in return for providing them with assistance in their battle with Massoud&#x27;s Northern Alliance. The IMU established offices and training camps, and began expanding their recruitment of disaffected Uzbeks.

It is estimated in 2000 that the IMU was approximately 2000 strong, and in the spring they contributed around 600 fighters to the Taliban&#x27;s offensive against Massoud, participating in the successful siege of Taloqan, where they fought alongside Bin Laden&#x27;s 055 Brigade. The IMU also provided the Taliban with a useful degree of deniability, under pressure from China to expel Uighur militants the Taliban simply sent them north to the IMU&#x27;s camps.

By the summer of 2000 Western and CIS intelligence sources claim the IMU were equipped with more advanced weaponry such as sniper rifles and night-vision goggles, and had been supplied with a pair of heavy transport helicopters by Bin Laden. Namangani led IMU fighters back to the Tavildara Valley in Tajikistan, and from there launched multipronged attacks into Batken in Kyrgyzstan, and also into northern Uzbekistan, close to Tashkent.

In August 2000 the IMU also kidnapped four U.S. mountain-climbers (Tommy Caldwell, Beth Rodden, Jason &quot;Singer&quot; Smith, and John Dickey) in the Kara-Su Valley of Kyrgyzstan, holding them hostage until they escaped on 12 August. In response, the United States classified the IMU as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.

Once again the raids were followed by a strategic retreat to Tavildara, and once again international pressure on the Tajik government saw Namangani agree to him and his men being flown by the Russians back to Afghanistan, where they arrived in January 2001.

By 2001 the connections between the IMU and the Taliban had become more overt, with media reports of Namangani had been appointed Deputy Defence Minister in the Taliban government, which the Taliban did not deny. In the spring the IMU again supplied the Taliban with 600 fighters for a renewed campaign against Massoud, while in Batken in Kyrgyzstan a number of sleepers armed the previous year executed a series of attacks.

Uzbek government maintained contacts with Afghan Talibans during the final months of Taliban rule over Afghanistan. The contacts were aimed at convincing Talibans to hand over militants belonging to Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.

===Overthrow of Taliban rule===
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the American-led invasion of Afghanistan, the IMU was largely destroyed while fighting alongside the Taliban, with Namangani being killed in November 2001 by a U.S. airstrike in northern Afghanistan. In March 2002, Yuldashev and many IMU members are believed to have fought against Coalition forces during Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan&#x27;s Shahi Kot Valley, suffering heavy casualties before retreating to the Tribal Areas of Pakistan.

Members of the IMU began settling down in the region, with some starting families and becoming involved in local business. The group developed close ties with members of the Taliban and al-Qaeda who had also taken refuge in the region, often serving as bodyguards for senior commanders. Tensions grew with some locals however, with the Uzbeks accused by local Taliban leader Maulvi Nazir of disrespecting local customs, killing tribesmen, and involving themselves in local feuds. In early 2007, fighting broke out between Nazir&#x27;s fighters and the Uzbeks, which resulted in hundreds of casualties on both sides and the expulsion of the IMU from much of South Waziristan.

Many of the retreating IMU members were sheltered by the local militant commander Baitullah Mehsud, and when Mehsud turned against the Pakistani state and formed the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in 2007, the IMU cooperated closely with him. The alliance between the two groups continued after Hakimullah Mehsud succeeded Baitullah as TTP leader in 2009, the IMU and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan carried out joint attacks on the Pakistani State and eventually formed a combined unit called Ansar al-Aseer, with the goal of freeing militant Islamist prisoners held in Pakistani prisons. Close ties were also formed with the militant Haqqani Network following the August 2009 killing of Yuldashev in a US drone strike, as the IMU&#x27;s new leadership relocated the group to the Haqqani strongholds of Mir Ali and Miranshah in North Waziristan.

===Return to Afghanistan and later events===
The IMU became increasingly active in Afghanistan and was regularly cited as a terrorist threat by governments within and outside of the region. IMU fighters first started to become active in Afghanistan in 2007, fighting in the Taliban insurgency against Afghan and ISAF troops. From 2010 the IMU began to expand its presence into northern Afghanistan, particularly in ethnic Uzbek areas in and around Takhar Province. IMU commanders in northern Afghanistan integrated into the Taliban&#x27;s shadow government, exercising governance in areas where the Afghan government&#x27;s presence was weak.

Haji Seyit Dawud, director of the Afghan media-resources center in Kabul, claimed that the move to Afghanistan was natural as Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan was much more likely to find support in Afghanistan than in Pakistan. In Pakistan they were declared as foreign terrorist and Pakistan Army was killing them.

In June 2014, the Pakistan Armed Forces began a major military campaign against militant groups in North Waziristan, in the wake of the IMU and TTP&#x27;s attack on Jinnah International Airport. There were media reports in the following months that many IMU fighters and their families fled these military operations and moved to Afghanistan.

After a period of declining relations between Afghan Talibans and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), the group pledged its allegiance Islamic State (IS).

IMU leader Usman Ghazi declared the group&#x27;s support for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in September 2014, however it continued to cooperate closely with the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to Afghan government sources. In March 2015, a group of IMU militants in northern Afghanistan, led by Sadulla Urgenji, released a video in which they stated they no longer view the Taliban&#x27;s Mullah Omar as leader and pledged allegiance to ISIL&#x27;s Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. This was followed by another video in July 2015, in which Sheikh Muhammad Ali, identified as the IMU&#x27;s spiritual leader, swears allegiance to ISIL. In August 2015, a video was released by the group in which its leader, Usman Ghazi, leads IMU fighters in taking an oath of allegiance to ISIL and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Ghazi also stated that the group should now be considered as fighters for ISIL&#x27;s Afghanistan branch, Wilayat Khorasan. Following the pledge of allegiance, the Taliban launched an offensive against the IMU and forces loyal to dissident Taliban commander Mansoor Dadullah in Zabul Province, inflicting heavy casualties and effectively wiping out the group&#x27;s presence in the province.

In June 2016, a new faction of the IMU announced itself, denouncing ISIL and expressing its loyalty to the Taliban and al Qaeda. The group&#x27;s leader now is Samatov Mamasoli aka (Abu Ali). 
==Organization and leadership==

===Membership===

While IMU was originally an ethnic Uzbek movement, its recruitment base expanded to include Central Asians (Afghans, Tajiks, Uyghurs and Turkmens) and as well as Arabs, Chechens and Westerners.

Hizb ut-Tahrir and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan received Uyghur recruits from the diaspora in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. The movement&#x27;s goal is the takeover of Xinjiang and Central Asia. Uyghurs, Chechens, Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kyrgyz, Kazakhs and other ethnic groups flocked to serve under IMU leader Juma Namangani, who died in November 2001.

A number of the IMU&#x27;s senior leaders and ideologues have been non-Uzbeks, including its Kyrgyz former military commander, Abbas Mansur, and its Mufti (religious authority), Abu Zar al-Burmi, a Pakistani national of Burmese Rohingya descent. In 2011, of the 87 &quot;martyrs&quot; that the IMU listed on its website, only four were Uzbeks from Uzbekistan, while 64 were from Afghanistan, 10 from Tajikistan, six from Kyrgyzstan, and one each from Tatarstan, Germany and Pakistan.

One of the mouthpieces of IMU was Abu Dher al Barmi. He was IMU&#x27;s mufti, joining and then leaving ISIL in a video called ().

Afghan troops liquidated Ammar Sahib. Usman Ghazi, Abu Usman Adil, Tahir Yuldashev, and Juma Namangani were among the commanders of the IMU.

===Leadership===
On 30 September 2009, a man claiming to be a bodyguard of Tahir Yuldashev reported that Yuldashev had been killed in a US missile airstrike that occurred shortly after the death of Pakistan Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud.
 The next day, Pakistan and US officials confirmed this report. Almost a year later, the IMU website confirmed that Yuldashev had been killed on 27 August 2009 by a US Predator drone strike in South Waziristan, and described him as a Shaheed, or martyr.

On 17 August 2010, the IMU announced that Yuldashev&#x27;s long-serving deputy, Abu Usman Adil, had been appointed the group&#x27;s new leader. In his first statement, Adil called on his followers to wage jihad in the southern portion of Kyrgyzstan, in the wake of ethnic violence against the Uzbek minority. Adil was killed in an April 2012 US drone strike in Pakistan. In August 2012 the group announced that Adil&#x27;s deputy, Usman Ghazi, was their new leader.

===Funding===
The IMU is alleged by the magazine &quot;Eurasia Critic&quot; to be involved in organized criminal activities such as controlling and facilitating drug smuggling. The IMU is alleged by the United States of America to receive funding from the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.

===Media===
The IMU&#x27;s media arm is known as &quot;Jundallah Studio&quot;. It produces high-quality videos, publishes audio and written statements, and has released newsletters in Uzbek, Russian, Persian, Arabic, German, Burmese, Urdu and Pashto. The group also ran an Uzbek-language website called &quot;Furqon&quot;, which is no longer accessible.

==Claimed and alleged attacks==
The Government of Uzbekistan accused the IMU of being involved in the 2004 Tashkent bombings, which left 33 militants, 10 policemen, and four civilian dead; however, an IMU splinter group called the Islamic Jihad Union later claimed responsibility.

The Tajik government announced that it was seeking 23 suspected IMU members who Tajik authorities say attacked supporters of Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov on 28 September 2006, wounding two people.

In 2008, a number of men were arrested in eastern France, the Netherlands and Germany, for allegedly raising funds for the IMU between 2003 and 2008. Nine out of the ten men were convicted on 8 January 2013 in a Paris court.

The IMU and Taliban were blamed for the 28 May 2011 bombing in Taloqan, Afghanistan, that killed a top Afghan National Police commander, General Mohammed Daud Daud, and wounded the governor of Takhar Province and a German general.

An IMU suicide bomber was responsible for the December 2011 attack on the funeral of an Afghan government official in Takhar, killing 19 people, including Alhaj Mutalib Baig, an ethnic Uzbek Member of Parliament and former Tahkar Chief of Police.

===IMU attacks on Pakistan===
In April 2012, an estimated 150 IMU and TTP fighters launched a successful attack on Bannu Prison in Pakistan&#x27;s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, freeing nearly 400 prisoners, including Adnan Rashid, who was convicted of involvement in a 2003 assassination attempt against then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.

The BBC reported that members of the IMU took part in the 15 December 2012 Peshawar airport attack, resulting in the deaths of 4 civilians and all 5 attackers.

In June 2014, the IMU claimed responsibility for an attack on Pakistan&#x27;s Jinnah International Airport. At least 39 people were killed in the attack, including all 10 attackers.

A video released by the IMU in April 2015 showed members of the group beheading a Hazara man, one of 31 people kidnapped from a bus in Afghanistan in February 2015. The men threatened to kill more hostages unless their comrades are released from Afghan jails.

==Analysis==
In September 2002, an aide to Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, the Foreign Minister of the Taliban, claimed he had been sent prior to 9/11 to warn the U.S. government of an impending attack and to persuade them to take military action against Al Qaeda&#x27;s presence in Afghanistan. The aide claimed advance knowledge of the attack came from Yuldashev, which if true would indicate a high degree of cooperation between Al-Qaeda and the IMU.

In his book Terror and Consent, Philip Bobbitt noted that Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood, a scientist of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, had met Osama bin Laden in Kabul in August 2001. Mahmood is said to have disclosed that bin Laden &quot;insisted that he already had sufficient fissile material to build a [nuclear] bomb, having obtained it from former Soviet stockpiles through the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.&quot;

In 2003, A. Elizabeth Jones, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, testified on the threat of terrorism in Central Asia before the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia, arguing that the greatest threats were the IMU, and Hizb ut-Tahrir. Jones said that despite the death of Namangani, the &quot;IMU is still active in the region -- particularly in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan -- and it represents a serious threat to the region and therefore to our interests.&quot;

Mahmadsaid Juraqulov, head of the anti-organized crime department in the Interior Ministry of Tajikistan, told reporters in Dushanbe on 16 October 2006 that the &quot;Islamic Movement of Turkestan is the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan,&quot; and that Uzbek secret services manufactured the change in name. Juraqulov also said that the IMT was not a major security threat to Tajikistan or Kyrgyzstan. &quot;Everyone knows that it is in Uzbekistan that [the IMU] wants to create problems. For them, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are just regrouping bases they&#x27;re trying to reach.&quot;

Some analysts have asserted that rather than the image of a unified IMU under Namangani and Yuldeshev, it has always been an organization consisting of two poles: the radical, spiritual (Yuldeshev) and militant, criminal (Namangani).

<text>Tohir Yo&#x27;ldosh (Yunusov Umid), (born Tohir Abdulhalilovich Yuldashev, , 2 October 1967 – 1 October 2009) was an Uzbek Islamist militant who cofounded the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Islamist organization active in Central Asia, with Juma Namangani in August 1998. According to the Defense Intelligence Agency he was a key leader opposing US forces during Operation Anaconda. The United Nations considers the IMU an Islamic terrorist organization.

When Namangan, the IMU&#x27;s military leader and cofounder, was killed in an airstrike in Afghanistan in 2001, Yo&#x27;ldosh (Yunusov Umid) took over the IMU&#x27;s day-to-day operations as well.

According to the &quot;BBC&quot;, Yo&#x27;ldosh (Yunusov Umid) learned Al-Qaeda was planning to use hijacked airliners to attack the United States on 11 September 2001, prior to the attacks.
The &quot;BBC&quot; reported that Yo&#x27;ldosh then informed the Taliban Foreign Minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, who sent an envoy to warn the USA of al Qaeda&#x27;s attack plans prior to 11 September 2001. 

A video message from Tohir Yo&#x27;ldosh was reportedly distributed throughout the Uzbek areas of Central Asia in early 2007. In the video Tohir was reported to have said:

After Baitullah Mehsud was reported to have been killed by missiles fired from an American Predator drone the &quot;Asia Times&quot; reported that Yo&#x27;ldosh had been Baitullah&#x27;s ideological mentor, that Tohir had put 2,500 experienced fighters at his disposal, and that Baitullah lived with the Uzbek, who became his biggest ideological inspiration.

On 30 September 2009, a man, who claimed to be Yo&#x27;ldosh&#x27;s bodyguard, reported to the Pakistan newspaper &quot;The News International&quot; that Yo&#x27;ldosh was killed in a US Predator drone airstrike shortly after Mehsud&#x27;s death.
Pakistan and US officials afterwards confirmed Yo&#x27;ldosh was killed in an airstrike on 27 August 2009. Yuldashev reportedly lost a leg and arm in the drone missile strike on 27 August 2009 and was rushed to a private hospital in Zhob district of Balochistan where he died on 1 October. His death was formally announced by the IMU on 16 August 2010.

<text>Ole Bornemann Bull (; 5 February 181017 August 1880) was a Norwegian virtuoso violinist and composer. According to Robert Schumann, he was on a level with Niccolò Paganini for the speed and clarity of his playing.

==Biography==

===Background===
Bull was born in Bergen, Norway. He was the eldest of ten children of Johan Storm Bull (1787–1838) and Anna Dorothea Borse Geelmuyden (1789–1875). His brother, Georg Andreas Bull became a noted Norwegian architect. He was also the uncle of Edvard Hagerup Bull, Norwegian judge and politician.

His father wished for him to become a minister, but he desired a musical career. At the age of four or five, he could play all of the songs he had heard his mother play on the violin. At age nine, he played first violin in the orchestra of Bergen&#x27;s theatre and was a soloist with the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra.
At eighteen, he was sent to the University of Christiania, but failed his examinations. He joined the Musical Lyceum, a musical society, and after its director Waldemar Thrane was taken ill, Bull became the director of Musical Lyceum and the Theater Orchestra in 1828. He also became friends with Henrik Wergeland, who later wrote a biography of Bull.

==Career==

After living for a while in Germany, where he pretended to study law, he went to Paris but fared badly for a year or two. In 1832 in Paris he shared rooms with Frederic Chopin as well as the Moravian violin virtuoso Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst. He was eventually successful in becoming a high-level virtuoso, giving thousands of concerts. In England alone these included 274 in 1837, during which visit he also travelled to some of the more remote parts of Britain. Catherine Darwin told her brother about a Shrewsbury concert when &quot;the best performer was Ole Bull on the Violin, who I think very superior to Paganini&quot;. Bull became very famous and made a huge fortune. He is believed to have composed more than 70 works, but only about 10 are known today. Best known is &quot;Sæterjentens søndag&quot; (&quot;The dairymaid&#x27;s Sunday&quot;).

Bull was caught up in a rising tide of Norwegian romantic nationalism, and acclaimed the idea of Norway as a sovereign state, separate from Sweden—which became a reality in 1905. In 1850, he co-founded the first theater in which actors spoke Norwegian rather than Danish, namely Det Norske Theater in Bergen—which later became Den Nationale Scene.

In the summer of 1858, Bull met the 15-year-old Edvard Grieg. Bull was a friend of the Grieg family, since Ole Bull&#x27;s brother was married to the sister of Grieg&#x27;s mother. Bull noticed Edvard&#x27;s talent and persuaded his parents to send him to further develop his talents at the Leipzig Conservatory. During the 1860s and 1870s Bull went on several tours across the U.S., often accompanied by soprano Varian Hoffman, baritone Ignatz Pollak, and pianist Edward Hoffman. He was concertmaster at the National Peace Jubilee (June 15–19, 1869) which featured an orchestra of 525 players

Robert Schumann once wrote that Bull was among &quot;the greatest of all,&quot; and that he was on a level with Niccolò Paganini for the speed and clarity of his playing. Bull was also a friend of Franz Liszt and played with him on several occasions.

==Instruments==
Bull also was a clever luthier, after studies in Paris with Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. He collected many beautiful violins and violas of Amati, Gasparo da Salò, Guarneri, Stradivari and others. He was the owner of one of the finest violins of the world, made by Gasparo da Salò around 1574 for Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria. The violin, a gift of his widow to Bull&#x27;s birthplace, is now in the Bergen Vestlandske Kustindustrimuseum. Bull often performed with Guarneri del Gesù violins during his career.

===Ole Bull Colony===
Bull visited the United States several times and was met with great success. In 1852, he obtained a large tract of land in Pennsylvania and founded a colony he called New Norway, but that is commonly referred to as Ole Bull Colony. On 24 May 1852, he formally purchased for $10,388. The land consisted of four communities: New Bergen, now known as Carter Camp; Oleona, named after him and his mother, six miles (10 km) south of New Bergen; New Norway, one mile south of New Bergen; and Valhalla in the Kettle Creek area.

Bull called the highest point in Valhalla, Nordjenskald, which became the location of his unfinished castle. He soon gave up on this venture, as there was scarcely any land to till, and went back to giving concerts.

Today the site is the location of the Ole Bull State Park, 132-acre (53 ha) state park in Stewardson Township, Potter County, Pennsylvania. Norwegian citizens paid for the construction of a monument on site to honor Ole Bull. The statue was placed in the park on the 150th anniversary of New Norway in 2002.

===Family life===
In 1836, Bull married Alexandrine Félicie Villeminot. They had six children, only two of whom survived him. Alexandrine died in 1862. Their children were:
* Ole Storm Felix Bull (1837–39)
* Alexander Ole Felix Etienne Bull (1839–1914)
* Thorvald Bull (1841–62)
* Eleonore Felicie Bull (1843–1923)
* Ernst Bornemann Bull (1844; lived only 5 months)
* Lucie Edvardine Bull (1846–68)

In 1868 Bull met Sara Chapman Thorp (1850–1911), the daughter of a prosperous lumber merchant from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. On a return visit in 1870, despite their age difference (he was 60, she was 20), Bull began a courtship, and the couple was secretly married in Norway in June 1870, with a formal wedding in Madison later that year. They had one daughter, Olea (1871–1913).
In 1871, he bought a summer home on a rise in West Lebanon, Maine which he named &quot;Ironwell&quot;. Sara traveled with Bull for the remainder of his career, sometimes accompanying him on the piano. In 1883 she published a memoir of Bull&#x27;s life.

===Later years===
Ole Bull bought the island of Lysøen in Os, south of Bergen, in 1872. He hired architect Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe (1833–1901) to design a residence on the island. Bull died from cancer in his home on Lysøen on 17 August 1880. He had held his last concert in Chicago the same year, despite his illness. A testament to his fame was his funeral procession, perhaps the most spectacular in Norway&#x27;s history. The ship transporting his body was guided by 15 steamers and a large number of smaller vessels.
==Legacy==
*Ole Bull&#x27;s villa on the island of Lysøen was donated to the Association of Norwegian Ancient Monuments Conservation. Museet Lysøen consists of violinist Ole Bull&#x27;s Villa, an old farm from the 17th century.
*Oleona in Potter County is situated in the mountains of northern Pennsylvania at the intersection of Routes 44 and 144 (Ole Bull Road).
*Ole Bull State Park in the Susquehannock State Forest is on the original site chosen for Bull&#x27;s colony. The unfinished Ole Bull Castle is maintained by the park and can be visited by hikers. A monument to honor Ole Bull was placed in the park on the 150th anniversary of New Norway in 2002.
*Mammoth Cave in Kentucky has a room called Ole Bull&#x27;s Concert Hall where he once gave performances.
*Loring Park in Minneapolis, Minnesota is the site of a bronze statue memorializing Ole Bull.
*Ole Bull Cottage, originally purchased to be a school for music by Ole Bull and his wife, is at Green Acre Baháʼí School in Eliot, Maine. Erected in 1896, the Ole Bull Cottage currently serves as the school library building.
*Ole Bull Academy (&quot;Ole Bull Akademiet&quot;) in Voss, Norway is a music education institution founded in 1977.
*Ole Bull Scene is a stage for cabaret, music and theater at the Ole Bull Plass in Bergen, Norway.

*In 1992, the Guarneri del Gesù &quot;Ole Bull&quot; violin of 1744, one of Bull&#x27;s favorite violins and believed to be the last work of Guarneri del Gesù, was acquired for collection at the Chimei Museum in Taiwan.
*In 2006, director Aslak Aarhus released a motion picture titled &quot;Ole Bull—The Titan&quot;, the story of Bull&#x27;s exploits and the impact it had on his French wife and children, who remained neglected in Bergen.
*In 2010 the Norwegian record label 2L released world premiere recordings of Ole Bull&#x27;s violin concertos and his Spanish fantasy &quot;La Verbena de San Juan&quot; and a previously unknown version for violin and strings of &quot;A Sæterbesøg&quot;. The performers on the disc are Annar Follesø, violin, and the Norwegian Radio Orchestra conducted by Ole Kristian Ruud.
*The violin played by Ole Bull in concert in Wilmington, DE c.1847 is in the Sanderson Museum in Chadds Ford, PA. www.sandersonmuseum.org. A sworn affidavit of provenance states: After Bazel Graves of West Chester, PA. purchased it from Bull in 1847, it was inherited by Graves&#x27; stepson Jefferson Shaner in 1855. Shaner subsequently sold it to Christian Carmack Sanderson in 1922 for $125. The violin is a copy of a Stainer model and was recently restored to concert condition in 2015 by luthier Teal Wintsch in Wilmington, DE.
*Around the turn of the 20th century, a commercial signature line of Ole Bull violins was manufactured in Germany. 
*The Wisconsin Historical Society owns a posthumous, full-length portrait of Ole Bull with violin painted by James Reeve Stuart (1834–1915).
*The subject of Chapter 24 of the Life of Rasmus Anderson is his encounter with Ole Bull.

<doc id="389380" wikidata="Q335493" url="?curid=389380" title="Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton">
<text>Edward Robert Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton, (8 November 1831 – 24 November 1891), was an English statesman, Conservative politician and poet who used the pseudonym Owen Meredith. During his tenure as Viceroy of India between 1876 and 1880, Queen Victoria was proclaimed Empress of India. He served as British Ambassador to France from 1887 to 1891.

His tenure as Viceroy was controversial for its ruthlessness in both domestic and foreign affairs, especially for his handling of the Great Famine of 1876–1878 and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. His son Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton, who was born in India, later served as Governor of Bengal and briefly as acting Viceroy. The senior earl was also the father-in-law of the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who designed New Delhi.

Lytton was a protégé of Benjamin Disraeli in domestic affairs, and of Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, who was his predecessor as Ambassador to France, in foreign affairs. His tenure as Ambassador to Paris was successful, and Lytton was afforded the rare tribute – especially for an Englishman – of a French state funeral in Paris.

==Childhood and education==
Lytton was the son of the novelists Edward Bulwer-Lytton and Rosina Doyle Wheeler (who was the daughter of the early women&#x27;s rights advocate Anna Wheeler). His uncle was Sir Henry Bulwer. His childhood was spoiled by the altercations of his parents, who separated acrimoniously when he was a boy. However, Lytton received the patronage of John Forster – an influential friend of Leigh Hunt, Charles Lamb, Walter Savage Landor, and Charles Dickens – who was generally considered to be the first professional biographer of 19th century England.

Lytton&#x27;s mother, who lost access to her children, satirised his father in her 1839 novel &quot;Cheveley, or the Man of Honour&quot;. His father subsequently had his mother placed under restraint, as a consequence of an assertion of her insanity, which provoked public outcry and her liberation a few weeks later. His mother chronicled this episode in her memoirs.

After being taught at home for a while, he was educated in schools in Twickenham and Brighton and thence Harrow, and at the University of Bonn.

==Diplomatic career==
Lytton entered the Diplomatic Service in 1849, when aged 18, when he was appointed as attaché to his uncle, Sir Henry Bulwer, who was Minister at Washington, DC. It was at this time he met Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. He began his salaried diplomatic career in 1852 as an attaché to Florence, and subsequently served in Paris, in 1854, and in The Hague, in 1856 . In 1858, he served in St Petersburg, Constantinople, and Vienna. In 1860, he was appointed British consul-general at Belgrade.

In 1862, Lytton was promoted to Second Secretary in Vienna, but his success in Belgrade made Lord Russell appoint him, in 1863, as Secretary of the Legation at Copenhagen, during his tenure as which he twice acted as Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in the Schleswig-Holstein conflict. In 1864, Lytton was transferred to the Greek court to advise the young Danish Prince. In 1865, he served in Lisbon, where he concluded a major commercial treaty with Portugal, and subsequently in Madrid. He subsequently became Secretary to the Embassy at Vienna and, in 1872, to Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons, who was Ambassador to Paris. By 1874, Lytton was appointed British Minister Plenipotentiary at Lisbon where he remained until being appointed Governor General and Viceroy of India in 1876. 
==Viceroy of India (1876–1880)==

After turning down an appointment as governor of Madras, Lytton&#x27;s appointment as Viceroy of India was announced in 1876. As he was a man of letters instead of a politician, the appointment caused &quot;general astonishment&quot;, but the appointment owed something to Disraeli&#x27;s appreciation of Lytton&#x27;s literary sensibilities.

On his journey to India, he met up in Egypt with the Prince of Wales, who was returning from his own Indian tour, by prior arrangement. He arrived in India and on 12 April 1876 was installed as viceroy.

=== Domestic policies ===

==== Delhi Durbar ====
The first great occasion of Lytton&#x27;s viceroyalty was the Delhi Durbar on 1 January 1877, known as the &quot;Proclamation Durbar&quot;, to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s acceptance of the title of Empress of India. The durbar was attended 68,000 people and 15,000 British and Indian troops: it marked symbolically the beginnings of Britain&#x27;s alliance with the Indian princes, who pledged their alliance to the new Empress.

Lord Lytton presided over the proceedings in the robes of the Grand Master of the Order of the Star of India. He read a speech, in which he announced the creation of the Order of the Indian Empire.

The Durbar was out of touch to the Indians. Lakhs of rupees were spent on the event but nothing was done for Indians who were in the grip of a famine.

He was created a GCB in late 1877, at the end of his first year in office.

==== Great Famine ====
The most important domestic event of Lytton&#x27;s tenure was the famine which broke out shortly after he assumed office. Lytton&#x27;s handling of the famine was controversial, and it was attacked by the British journalist William Digby and the businessman Dadabhai Naoroji. 

Lytton&#x27;s decision to allocate resources towards the grand ceremony of Delhi Durbar of 1877, which was perceived as a display of British power and wealth, further exacerbated the famine&#x27;s severity, ultimately leading to substantial human suffering and loss of life. 

After the famine, Lytton appointed a commission, headed by Sir Richard Strachey, to study ways to deal with future occurrences. The commission resulted in the enactment of famine codes in every province as well as the establishment of a fund to deal with famine relief, which were effective in dealing with the phenomenon. They have been described as &quot;the most significant—and perhaps the only—achievement of Lytton&#x27;s viceroyalty.&quot;

==== Vernacular Press Act ====
In 1878, he implemented the Vernacular Press Act, which enabled the Viceroy to confiscate the press and paper of any Indian Vernacular newspaper that published content that the Government deemed to be &quot;seditious&quot;, in response to which there was a public protest in Calcutta that was led by the Indian Association and Surendranath Banerjee.

One of the key reasons for passing this act, apart from the onset of the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80), was the reception of the Durbar in the local atmosphere. Durbars held different meanings for Britons, Anglo-Indians, and Indians. While European and Anglo-Indian media, along with agencies like Reuters, praised the Durbars, the Indian press was openly critical. To suppress this dissent, the Vernacular Press Act (VPA) was unanimously passed by the Viceroy&#x27;s Council on 14 March 1878. 

===Second Anglo-Afghan War, 1878–1880===
Britain was deeply concerned throughout the 1870s about Russian attempts to increase its influence in Afghanistan, which provided a Central Asian buffer state between the Russian Empire and British India. Lytton had been given express instructions to recover the friendship of the Amir of Afghanistan, Sher Ali Khan, who was perceived at this point to have sided with Russia against Britain, and made every effort to do so for eighteen months. In September 1878, Lytton sent General Sir Neville Bowles Chamberlain as an emissary to Afghanistan, but he was refused entry. Considering himself left with no real alternative, in November 1878, Lytton ordered an invasion which sparked the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

The British won virtually all the major battles of this war, and in the final settlement, the Treaty of Gandamak, saw a government installed under a new amir which was both by personality and law receptive to British demands; however, the human and material costs of the conflict provoked extensive controversy, particularly among the nascent Indian press, which questioned why Lytton spent so much money prosecuting the conflict with Afghanistan instead of focusing on famine relief. This, along with the massacre of British diplomat Sir Louis Cavagnari and his staff by mutinying Afghan soldiers, contributed to the defeat of Disraeli&#x27;s Conservative government by Gladstone&#x27;s Liberals in 1880.

The war was seen at the time as an ignominious but barely acceptable end to the &quot;Great Game&quot;, closing a long chapter of conflict with the Russian Empire without even a proxy engagement. The pyrrhic victory of British arms in India was a quiet embarrassment which played a small but critical role in the nascent scramble for Africa; in this way, Lytton and his war helped shape the contours of the 20th century in dramatic and unexpected ways. Lytton resigned at the same time as the Conservative government. He was the last Viceroy of India to govern an open frontier.

=== Assassination attempt ===
In December 1879, Lytton was the target of an assassination attempt while on tour in Calcutta, but escaped unharmed. The would-be assassin was George Edward Dessa, who suffered from delusions; he was deemed unfit to stand trial and died in an asylum.

===Commemoration===
A permanent exhibition in Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, is dedicated to his diplomatic service in India. There is a monument dedicated in his name at Nahan, Himachal Pradesh, India, domestically called Delhi Gate.

==Domestic politics==
In 1880, Lytton resigned his Viceroyalty at the same time that Benjamin Disraeli resigned the premiership. Lytton was created Earl of Lytton, in the County of Derby, and Viscount Knebworth, of Knebworth in the County of Hertford. On 10 January 1881, Lytton made his maiden speech in the House of Lords, in which he censured in Gladstone&#x27;s devolutionist Afghan policy. In the summer session of 1881, Lytton joined others in opposing Gladstone&#x27;s second Irish Land Bill. As soon as the summer session was over, he undertook &quot;a solitary ramble about the country&quot;. He visited Oxford for the first time, went for a trip on the Thames, and then revisited the hydropathic establishment at Malvern, where he had been with his father as a boy&quot;. He saw this as an antidote to the otherwise indulgent lifestyle that came with his career, and used his sojourn there to undertake a critique of a new volume of poetry by his friend Wilfrid Blunt.

==Ambassador to Paris: 1887–1891==
Lytton was Ambassador to France from 1887 to 1891. During the second half of the 1880s, before his appointment as Ambassador in 1887, Lytton served as Secretary to the Ambassador to Paris, Lord Lyons. He succeeded Lyons, as Ambassador, subsequent to the resignation of Lyons in 1887. Lytton had previously expressed an interest in the post and enjoyed himself &quot;once more back in his old profession&quot;.

Lord Lytton died in Paris on 24 November 1891, where he was given the rare honour of a state funeral. His body was then brought back for interment in the private family mausoleum in Knebworth Park.

There is also a memorial to him in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London.

==Writings as &quot;Owen Meredith&quot;==

When Lytton was twenty-five years old, he published in London a volume of poems under the name of Owen Meredith. He went on to publish several other volumes under the same name. The most popular is &quot;Lucile&quot;, a story in verse published in 1860. His poetry was extremely popular and critically commended in his own day. He was a great experimenter with form. His best work is beautiful, and much of it is of a melancholy nature, as this short extract from a poem called &quot;A Soul&#x27;s Loss&quot; shows, where the poet bids farewell to a lover who has betrayed him:

Lytton underesteemed his poetic ability: in his &quot;Chronicles and Characters&quot; (1868), the poor response to which distressed him, Lytton states, &#x27;Talk not of genius baffled. Genius is master of man./Genius does what it must, and Talent does what it can&#x27;. However, Lytton&#x27;s poetic ability was highly esteemed by other literary personalities of the day, and Oscar Wilde dedicated his play &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; to him.

Lytton&#x27;s publications included:
* &quot;Clytemnestra&quot;, &quot;The Earl&#x27;s Return&quot;, &quot;The Artist and Other Poems&quot; (1855)
* &quot;The Wanderer&quot; (1859), a Byron-esque lyric of Continental adventures that was popular on its release
* &quot;Lucile&quot; (1860). Lytton was accused of plagiarizing George Sand&#x27;s novel Lavinia for the story.
* &quot;Serbski Pesme&quot; (1861). Plagiarized from a French translation of Serbian poems.
* &quot;The Ring of Ainasis&quot; (1863)
* &quot;Fables in Song&quot; (1874)
* &quot;Speeches of Edward Lord Lytton with some of his Political Writings, Hitherto unpublished, and a Prefactory Memoir by His Son&quot; (1874)
* &quot;The Life Letters and Literary Remains of Edward Bulwer, Lord Lytton&quot; (1883)
* &quot;Glenaveril&quot; (1885)
* &quot;After Paradise, or Legends of Exile&quot; (1887)
* &quot;King Poppy: A Story Without End&quot; (partially composed in early 1870s: only first published in 1892), an allegorical romance in blank verse that was Lytton&#x27;s favourite of his verse romances

Based on the French translation, in 1868 he published a drama titled &quot;Orval, or the Fool of Time&quot; which has been inspired by Krasiński&#x27;s &quot;The Undivine Comedy&quot; to the point it has been discussed in scholarly literature as an example of a &quot;rough translation&quot;, paraphrase or even plagiarism.

== Marriage and children==

On 4 October 1864 Lytton married Edith Villiers. She was the daughter of Edward Ernest Villiers (1806–1843) and Elizabeth Charlotte Liddell and the granddaughter of George Villiers.

They had at least seven children:
* Edward Rowland John Bulwer-Lytton (1865–1871)
* Lady Elizabeth Edith &quot;Betty&quot; Bulwer-Lytton (1867–1942). Married Gerald Balfour, 2nd Earl of Balfour, brother of Prime Minister Arthur Balfour.
* Lady Constance Bulwer-Lytton (1869–1923)
* Hon. Henry Meredith Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1872–1874)
* Lady Emily Bulwer-Lytton (1874–1964). Married Edwin Lutyens. Associate of Krishnamurti.
* Victor Bulwer-Lytton, 2nd Earl of Lytton (1876–1947)
* Neville Bulwer-Lytton, 3rd Earl of Lytton (1879–1951)

<text>John William Rolfe Kempe (29 October 1917 – 10 May 2010) was headmaster of Gordonstoun School from 1968 to 1978, during the period that the Princes Andrew and Edward arrived at the school. He was a noted mountaineer and a member of the Alpine Club.

==Early life==
He was born in Nairobi, the son of an officer in the Colonial Service. His father died of fever when he was four and Kempe was brought up in Norfolk by his mother. He was educated at Stowe School and Clare College, Cambridge, where he read economics and mathematics.

At Cambridge he joined the University Air Squadron and in 1937 was commissioned in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. In 1941, he was posted to No. 602 Squadron RAF, which was initially stationed at RAF Drem near Haddington. During the Battle of Britain, the squadron was relocated to Sussex where Kempe flew Spitfires. In May 1942, he was promoted to squadron leader and the following year was mentioned in despatches. From 1944 he flew, principally Mosquitos, in North Africa and acted as a convoy escort on the Malta run. Before being demobilised in 1946, he was again mentioned in despatches.

==Mountaineering==
In 1952 he was a member of the British N.W. Garhwal Expedition with John Jackson. The party went on to attempt an ascent of the unclimbed 6,500 metres (21,300 ft) Nilkanta, on the route they bivouaced at 16,000’ and 17,000’, but ultimately they were defeated by heavy snow.

In 1954, Kempe led a party to Kangchenjunga, the 3rd highest mountain in the world, which had not then been climbed. This was intended as a reconnaissance expedition, the party also included J. W. Tucker (who wrote a book about the expedition&#x27;s activities), S. R. Jackson (the brother of John Jackson), T. H. Braham, G. C. Lewis and medical officer, Dr. D. S. Mathews, they explored the upper Yalung glacier with the intention to discover a practicable route to the great ice-shelf that runs across the south-west face of Kangchenjunga. This reconnaissance led to the route used by the successful 1955 expedition. John Hunt wrote in the Foreword to Tucker&#x27;s book that the 1954 reconnaissance was &quot;&quot;a first step in solving what I have long reckoned to be the greatest problem in mountaineering&quot; and &quot;thanks to the fine efforts of Kempe and his comrades, the momentus decision was made to take the second, and as it proved to be, final step towards the top of the third highest point on Earth&quot;&quot;, that final step was the successful 1955 expedition, when George Band and Joe Brown made the first ascent of Kangchenjunga.

Kempe was the leader of an expedition to the Peruvian Andes in 1956. The party, comprised three from the 1954 Kangchenjunga expedition (Kempe, Tucker and Matthews) supplemented by Mike Westmacott, George Band and John Streetly.

<text>Alexandre Cabanel (; 28 September 1823 – 23 January 1889) was a French painter. He painted historical, classical and religious subjects in the academic style. He was also well known as a portrait painter. He was Napoleon III&#x27;s preferred painter and, with Gérôme and Meissonier, was one of &quot;the three most successful artists of the Second Empire.&quot;

==Biography==
Cabanel was the son of a modest carpenter, and he began his apprenticeship at the Montpellier School of Fine Arts in the class of Charles Matet, curator of the Musée Fabre. Equipped with a scholarship, he moved to Paris in 1839.

Cabanel entered the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris at the age of seventeen, in 1840, where he studied with François-Édouard Picot.

After two failures, with the paintings &quot;Cincinnatus receiving the ambassadors of Rome&quot;, in 1843, and &quot;Christ in the Garden of Olives&quot;, in 1844, he won the Prix de Rome scholarship, in 1845 at the age of 22. He would be a resident of the Villa Medici until 1850.

Cabanel was both a history painter and a genre painter, and he evolved over the years towards romantic themes, like &quot;Albaydé&quot; (1848), inspired by &quot;Les Orientales&quot;, by Victor Hugo (1829).

He received the insignia of knight of the Legion of Honor, in 1855.

He gained more recognition with &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot;, exhibited at the Salon of 1863, and which was immediately purchased by Napoleon III for his personal collection. The acclaimed painting entered the Luxembourg Museum, in 1881, and is now held at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, in Paris. He signed a contract with the Goupil house for the marketing of engraved reproductions of this painting. There is a smaller replica, painted in 1875 for a banker, John Wolf, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York City. It was offered to the museum by Wolf in 1893. The classical composition embodies ideals of Academic art: a mythological subject, graceful modeling, silky brushwork, and perfected forms. This style was perennially popular with collectors, even as when it was challenged by artists seeking a more realistic approach, such as Gustave Courbet. He was also criticized by writers and critics like Émile Zola and Joris-Karl Huysmans, who were more open to the modern artistic tendencies.

Cabanel was elected a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in the 10th chair, in 1863. He was appointed professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1864, where he taught until his death. He was in the same year promoted to the rank of officer of the Legion of Honor. 

Between 1868 and 1888, he was a member of the Salon jury seventeen times: &quot;He was elected regularly to the Salon jury and his pupils could be counted by the hundred at the Salons. Through them, Cabanel did more than any other artist of his generation to form the character of the &quot;belle époque&quot; French painting&quot;. His refusal together with William-Adolphe Bouguereau to allow the impressionist painter Édouard Manet, and other painters, to exhibit their work in the Salon of 1863 led to the establishment of the Salon des Refusés by the French government. Cabanel won the Great Medal of Honour at the Salons of 1865, 1867, and 1878.

However, he intervened in 1881 during the presentation of &quot;Pertuiset, Le chasseur de lions&quot;, by Manet, and defended it by saying: &quot;Gentlemen, there is not one among us who is capable of doing a head like that in the open air!&quot;

At the Universal Exhibition of 1867, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the First Class of the Order of Merit of Saint Michael of Bavaria, following his &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, commissioned for the Maximilianeum, in Munich, by Ludwig II of Bavaria.

He was promoted to the rank of Commander of the Legion of Honor in 1884, and was elected associate of the Royal Academy of Belgium on 6 January 1887.

He died on 24 January 1889, in his hotel at 14 rue Alfred de Vigny, in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. His funeral took place in Paris, on 26 January 1889, in the Saint-Philippe du Roule church, then his body was transported to Montpellier, where it was buried in the Saint-Lazare on 28 January 1889. A monument was erected to him in 1892 by the architect Jean Camille Formigé, decorated with a marble bust by Paul Dubois and a sculpture, &quot;Regret&quot;, by Antonin Mercié.

<text>Scientific management is a theory of management that analyzes and workflows. Its main objective is improving economic efficiency, especially labor productivity. It was one of the earliest attempts to apply science to the engineering of processes in management. Scientific management is sometimes known as Taylorism after its pioneer, Frederick Winslow Taylor.

Taylor began the theory&#x27;s development in the United States during the 1880s and 1890s within manufacturing industries, especially steel. Its peak of influence came in the 1910s. Although Taylor died in 1915, by the 1920s scientific management was still influential but had entered into competition and syncretism with opposing or complementary ideas.

Although scientific management as a distinct theory or school of thought was obsolete by the 1930s, most of its themes are still important parts of industrial engineering and management today. These include: analysis; synthesis; logic; rationality; empiricism; work ethic; efficiency through elimination of wasteful activities (as in &quot;muda&quot;, &quot;muri&quot; and &quot;mura&quot;); standardization of best practices; disdain for tradition preserved merely for its own sake or to protect the social status of particular workers with particular skill sets; the transformation of craft production into mass production; and knowledge transfer between workers and from workers into tools, processes, and documentation.

== Name ==
Taylor&#x27;s own names for his approach initially included &quot;shop management&quot; and &quot;process management&quot;. However, &quot;scientific management&quot; came to national attention in 1910 when attorney Louis Brandeis (then not yet Supreme Court justice) popularized the term. Brandeis had sought a consensus term for the approach with the help of practitioners like Henry L. Gantt and Frank B. Gilbreth. Brandeis then used the consensus of &quot;SCIENTIFIC management&quot; when he argued before the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) that a proposed increase in railroad rates was unnecessary despite an increase in labor costs; he alleged scientific management would overcome railroad inefficiencies (The ICC ruled against the rate increase, but also dismissed as insufficiently substantiated that concept the railroads were necessarily inefficient.) Taylor recognized the nationally known term &quot;scientific management&quot; as another good name for the concept, and adopted it in the title of his influential 1911 monograph.

== History ==
The Midvale Steel Company, &quot;one of America&#x27;s great armor plate making plants,&quot; was the birthplace of scientific management. In 1877, Frederick W. Taylor started as a clerk in Midvale, but advanced to foreman in 1880. As foreman, Taylor was &quot;constantly impressed by the failure of his [team members] to produce more than about one-third of [what he deemed] a good day&#x27;s work&quot;. Taylor determined to discover, by scientific methods, how long it should take men to perform each given piece of work; and it was in the fall of 1882 that he started to put the first features of scientific management into operation.

Horace Bookwalter Drury, in his 1918 work, &quot;Scientific management: A History and Criticism&quot;, identified seven other leaders in the movement, most of whom learned of and extended scientific management from Taylor&#x27;s efforts:
* Henry L. Gantt (1861–1919)
* Carl G. Barth (1860–1939)
* Horace K. Hathaway (1878–1944)
* Morris L. Cooke (1872–1960)
* Sanford E. Thompson (1867–1949)
* Frank B. Gilbreth (1868–1924). Gilbreth&#x27;s independent work on &quot;motion study&quot; is on record as early as 1885; after meeting Taylor in 1906 and being introduced to scientific management, Gilbreth devoted his efforts to introducing scientific management into factories. Gilbreth and his wife Lillian Moller Gilbreth (1878–1972) performed micro-motion studies using stop-motion cameras as well as developing the profession of industrial/organizational psychology.
* Harrington Emerson (1853–1931) began determining what industrial plants&#x27; products and costs were compared to what they ought to be in 1895. Emerson did not meet Taylor until December 1900, and the two never worked together.

Emerson&#x27;s testimony in late 1910 to the Interstate Commerce Commission brought the movement to national attention and instigated serious opposition. Emerson contended the railroads might save $1,000,000 a day by paying greater attention to efficiency of operation. By January 1911, a leading railroad journal began a series of articles denying they were inefficiently managed.

When steps were taken to introduce scientific management at the government-owned Rock Island Arsenal in early 1911, it was opposed by Samuel Gompers, founder and President of the American Federation of Labor (an alliance of craft unions). When a subsequent attempt was made to introduce the bonus system into the government&#x27;s Watertown Arsenal foundry during the summer of 1911, the entire force walked out for a few days. Congressional investigations followed, resulting in a ban on the use of time studies and pay premiums in Government service.

Taylor&#x27;s death in 1915 at age 59 left the movement without its original leader. In management literature today, the term &quot;scientific management&quot; mostly refers to the work of Taylor and his disciples (&quot;classical&quot;, implying &quot;no longer current, but still respected for its seminal value&quot;) in contrast to newer, improved iterations of efficiency-seeking methods. Today, task-oriented optimization of work tasks is nearly ubiquitous in industry.

== Scientific Management Principles ==
Frederick Taylor tackled the challenge of making a business productive and profitable in his years of service and research in a steel company. He believed in a scientific solution. In his &quot;Shop Management&quot; article, Taylor explained that there were two facts that appeared &quot;most noteworthy&quot; in the field of management: (a) &quot;Great unevenness&quot;: the lack of uniformity in what is called &quot;the management&quot;, (b) The lack of relation between good (shop) management and the pay. He added, &quot;The art of management has been defined, &quot;as knowing exactly what you want men to do, and then seeing that they do it in the best and cheapest way&quot;.&quot;

In this regard, he highlighted that although there is &quot;no concise definition&quot; for this art, &quot;the relations between employers and men form without question the most important part of this art&quot;. He then continued that a good management must in long run give satisfaction to both managers and workers. Taylor emphasized that he was advocating &quot;high wages&quot; and &quot;low labor cost&quot; as &quot;the foundation of the best management&quot;. Discussing the pays for different classes of workers and what he called a &quot;first-class&quot; workman, he compared different scenarios of workmanship and their pros and cons. For best management, he asserted with ample reasons that managers in an organization should follow the following guideline: (a) Each worker should be given the highest grade of work they are capable of.

(b) Each worker should be demanded the work that a first-grade worker can do and thrive.

(c) When each worker works at the pace of a first-grade worker, they should be paid 30% to 100% beyond the average of their class. While Taylor stated that sharing &quot;the equitable division of the profits&quot; is required in an organization, he believed that management could unite high wages with a low labor cost by application of the following principles:(a) A large daily task: Each worker in the organization, should have a clearly defined task.

(b) Standard Conditions: Each worker should be given standard conditions and appliances that will enable him to perform his tasks.

(c) High pay for success: Each worker should be rewarded when he accomplishes their task.

(d) Loss in case of failure: When a worker fails, he should know that he would share the loss.In Scientific Management, the responsibility of the success or failure of an organization is not solely on the shoulder of the workers, as it is in the old management systems. According to Scientific Management, the managers are taking half of the burden by being responsible for securing the proper work conditions for workers&#x27; prosperity.

In his book &quot;Principles of Scientific Management&quot;, Taylor formally introduced his methodically investigated theory of Scientific Management. Although he explained the details of Scientific Management in his works, he did not provide its concise definition. Shortly before his death, Taylor approved the following summary and definition of Scientific Management that Hoxie prepared: &quot;Scientific management is a system devised by industrial engineers for the purpose of serving the common interests of employers, workmen and society at large through the elimination of avoidable wastes, the general improvement of the processes and methods of production, and the just and scientific distribution of the product.&quot; Taylor indicated that Scientific Management consisted of four underlying principles:1) the development of a true science: We must scientifically analyze all parts of a job. This consists of examining the elements and steps that required to carry out the work, as well as measuring the optimum time for each task. We also need to know the working time per day for a qualified worker.

2) the scientific selection of the workers: The most suitable person for the job is selected.

3) the scientific education and training of the workers: There is a clear division of work and responsibility between managers and workers. While workers are carrying out the job with quality and workmanship, managers are responsible for planning, supervision, and proper training of the workers.

4) cooperation between managers and workers: Managers and workers scientific cooperation is required to ensure the proper and high-quality execution of the jobs.There are various tools that would enable us to serve these principles, such as time and motion study, functional foremanship, standardization of tools and movements of workers for each type of work, clear instructions for workers, and cost accounting.

There are many other features, tools, and methods that Taylor developed and recommended during his job at the steel plant and research, which have footprints in other fields, such as accounting and Engineering. Some of his concepts, studies, and findings has led to intellectual revolution in organization management. Taylor made contributions to various fields such as work measurement, production planning and control, process design, quality control, ergonomics, and human engineering.

== Pursuit of economic efficiency ==
Flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th century, scientific management built on earlier pursuits of economic efficiency. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of , it favored empirical methods to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus it was followed by a profusion of successors in applied science, including time and motion study, the Efficiency Movement (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management&#x27;s impact on business managers specifically), Fordism, operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, management science, manufacturing engineering, logistics, business process management, business process reengineering, lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.

Taylor rejected the notion, which was universal in his day and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In the course of his empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; material handling equipment as we know it today was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.

Subsequent forms of scientific management were articulated by Taylor&#x27;s disciples, such as Henry Gantt; other engineers and managers, such as Benjamin S. Graham; and other theorists, such as Max Weber. Taylor&#x27;s work also contrasts with other efforts, including those of Henri Fayol and those of Frank Gilbreth, Sr. and Lillian Moller Gilbreth (whose views originally shared much with Taylor&#x27;s but later diverged in response to Taylorism&#x27;s inadequate handling of human relations).

== Soldiering ==

Scientific management requires a high level of managerial control over employee work practices and entails a higher ratio of managerial workers to laborers than previous management methods. Such detail-oriented management may cause friction between workers and managers.

Taylor observed that some workers were more talented than others, and that even smart ones were often unmotivated. He observed that most workers who are forced to perform repetitive tasks tend to work at the slowest rate that goes unpunished. This slow rate of work has been observed in many industries and many countries and has been called by various terms. Taylor used the term &quot;soldiering&quot;, a term that reflects the way conscripts may approach following orders, and observed that, when paid the same amount, workers will tend to do the amount of work that the slowest among them does. Taylor describes soldiering as &quot;the greatest evil with which the working-people ... are now afflicted&quot;.

This reflects the idea that workers have a vested interest in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He, therefore, proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were rarely equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee&#x27;s compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large productivity gains while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.

== Productivity, automation, and unemployment ==
Taylorism led to productivity increases, meaning fewer workers or working hours were needed to produce the same amount of goods. In the short term, productivity increases like those achieved by Taylor&#x27;s efficiency techniques can cause considerable disruption. Labor relations often become contentious over whether the financial benefits will accrue to owners in the form of increased profits, or workers in the form of increased wages. As a result of decomposition and documentation of manufacturing processes, companies employing Taylor&#x27;s methods might be able to hire lower-skill workers, enlarging the pool of workers and thus lowering wages and job security.

In the long term, most economists consider productivity increases as a benefit to the economy overall, and necessary to improve the standard of living for consumers in general. By the time Taylor was doing his work, improvements in agricultural productivity had freed up a large portion of the workforce for the manufacturing sector, allowing those workers in turn to buy new types of consumer goods instead of working as subsistence farmers. In later years, increased manufacturing efficiency would free up large sections of the workforce for the service sector. If captured as profits or wages, the money generated by more-productive companies would be spent on new goods and services; if free market competition forces prices down close to the cost of production, consumers effectively capture the benefits and have more money to spend on new goods and services. Either way, new companies and industries spring up to profit from increased demand, and due to freed-up labor are able to hire workers. But the long-term benefits are no guarantee that individual displaced workers will be able to get new jobs that paid them as well or better as their old jobs, as this may require access to education or job training, or moving to different part of the country where new industries are growing. Inability to obtain new employment due to mismatches like these is known as structural unemployment, and economists debate to what extent this is happening in the long term, if at all, as well as the impact on income inequality for those who do find jobs.

Though not foreseen by early proponents of scientific management, detailed decomposition and documentation of an optimal production method also makes automation of the process easier, especially physical processes that would later use industrial control systems and numerical control. Widespread economic globalization also creates opportunity for work to be outsourced to lower-wage areas, with knowledge transfer made easier if an optimal method is already clearly documented. Especially when wages or wage differentials are high, automation and offshoring can result in significant productivity gains and similar questions of who benefits and whether or not technological unemployment is persistent. Because automation is often best suited to tasks that are repetitive and boring, and can also be used for tasks that are dirty, dangerous, and demeaning, proponents believe that in the long run it will free up human workers for more creative, safer, and more enjoyable work.

== Taylorism and unions ==
The early history of labor relations with scientific management in the U.S. was described by Horace Bookwalter Drury:

In 1911, organized labor erupted with strong opposition to scientific management, including from Samuel Gompers, founder and president of the American Federation of Labor (AFL).

Once the time-and-motion men had completed their studies of a particular task, the workers had very little opportunity for further thinking, experimenting, or suggestion-making. Taylorism was criticized for turning the worker into an &quot;automaton&quot; or &quot;machine&quot;, making work monotonous and unfulfilling by doing one small and rigidly defined piece of work instead of using complex skills with the whole production process done by one person. &quot;The further &#x27;progress&#x27; of industrial development... increased the anomic or forced division of labor,&quot; the opposite of what Taylor thought would be the effect. Some workers also complained about being made to work at a faster pace and producing goods of lower quality.


The Watertown Arsenal in Massachusetts provides an example of the application and repeal of the Taylor system in the workplace, due to worker opposition. In the early 20th century, neglect in the Watertown shops included overcrowding, dim lighting, lack of tools and equipment, and questionable management strategies in the eyes of the workers. Frederick W. Taylor and Carl G. Barth visited Watertown in April 1909 and reported on their observations at the shops. Their conclusion was to apply the Taylor system of management to the shops to produce better results. Efforts to install the Taylor system began in June 1909. Over the years of time study and trying to improve the efficiency of workers, criticisms began to evolve. Workers complained of having to compete with one another, feeling strained and resentful, and feeling excessively tired after work. In June 1913, employees of the Watertown Arsenal petitioned to abolish the practice of scientific management there. A number of magazine writers inquiring into the effects of scientific management found that the &quot;conditions in shops investigated contrasted favorably with those in other plants&quot;.

A committee of the U.S. House of Representatives investigated and reported in 1912, concluding that scientific management did provide some useful techniques and offered valuable organizational suggestions, but that it also gave production managers a dangerously high level of uncontrolled power. After an attitude survey of the workers revealed a high level of resentment and hostility towards scientific management, the Senate banned Taylor&#x27;s methods at the arsenal.

Taylor had a largely negative view of unions, and believed they only led to decreased productivity. Efforts to resolve conflicts with workers included methods of scientific collectivism, making agreements with unions, and the personnel management movement.

== Relationship to Fordism ==

It is often assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor&#x27;s work. Taylor apparently made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Michigan plants not too long before he died, but it is likely that the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor&#x27;s work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world&#x27;s experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded &quot;in spite of&quot;, not &quot;because of&quot;, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient floorplan layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905–1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905–1915.

== Adoption in planned economies ==

Scientific management appealed to managers of planned economies because central economic planning relies on the idea that the expenses that go into economic production can be precisely predicted and can be optimized by design.

=== Soviet Union ===

By 1913 Vladimir Lenin wrote that the &quot;most widely discussed topic today in Europe, and to some extent in Russia, is the &#x27;system&#x27; of the American engineer, Frederick Taylor&quot;; Lenin decried it as merely a &quot;&#x27;scientific&#x27; system of sweating&quot; more work from laborers. Again in 1914, Lenin derided Taylorism as &quot;man&#x27;s enslavement by the machine&quot;. However, after the Russian Revolutions brought him to power, Lenin wrote in 1918 that the &quot;Russian is a bad worker [who must] learn to work. The Taylor system... is a combination of the refined brutality of bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific achievements in the field of analysing mechanical motions during work, the elimination of superfluous and awkward motions, the elaboration of correct methods of work, the introduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of science and technology in this field.&quot;

In the Soviet Union, Taylorism was advocated by Aleksei Gastev and &quot;nauchnaia organizatsia truda&quot; (&quot;the movement for the scientific organization of labor&quot;). It found support in both Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Gastev continued to promote this system of labor management until his arrest and execution in 1939. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Soviet Union enthusiastically embraced Fordism and Taylorism, importing American experts in both fields as well as American engineering firms to build parts of its new industrial infrastructure. The concepts of the Five Year Plan and the centrally planned economy can be traced directly to the influence of Taylorism on Soviet thinking. As scientific management was believed to epitomize American efficiency, Joseph Stalin even claimed that &quot;the combination of the Russian revolutionary sweep with American efficiency is the essence of Leninism.&quot;

Sorensen was one of the consultants who brought American know-how to the USSR during this era, before the Cold War made such exchanges unthinkable. As the Soviet Union developed and grew in power, both sides, the Soviets and the Americans, chose to ignore or deny the contribution that American ideas and expertise had made: the Soviets because they wished to portray themselves as creators of their own destiny and not indebted to a rival, and the Americans because they did not wish to acknowledge their part in creating a powerful communist rival. Anti-communism had always enjoyed widespread popularity in America, and anti-capitalism in Russia, but after World War II, they precluded any admission by either side that technologies or ideas might be either freely shared or clandestinely stolen.

=== East Germany ===
By the 1950s, scientific management had grown dated, but its goals and practices remained attractive and were also being adopted by the German Democratic Republic as it sought to increase efficiency in its industrial sectors. Workers engaged in a state-planned instance of process improvement, pursuing the same goals that were contemporaneously pursued in capitalist societies, as in the Toyota Production System.

==Criticism of rigor==
Taylor believed that the scientific method of management included the calculations of exactly how much time it takes a man to do a particular task, or his rate of work. Critics of Taylor complained that such a calculation relies on certain arbitrary, non-scientific decisions such as what constituted the job, which men were timed, and under which conditions. Any of these factors are subject to change, and therefore can produce inconsistencies. Some dismiss so-called &quot;scientific management&quot; or Taylorism as pseudoscience.
Others are critical of the representativeness of the workers Taylor selected to take his measurements.

== Variations of scientific management after Taylorism ==
===In the 1900s===
Taylorism was one of the first attempts to systematically treat management and process improvement as a scientific problem, and Taylor is considered a founder of modern industrial engineering. Taylorism may have been the first &quot;bottom-up&quot; method and found a lineage of successors that have many elements in common. Later methods took a broader approach, measuring not only productivity but quality. With the advancement of statistical methods, quality assurance and quality control began in the 1920s and 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, the body of knowledge for doing scientific management evolved into operations management, operations research, and management cybernetics. In the 1980s total quality management became widely popular, growing from quality control techniques. In the 1990s &quot;re-engineering&quot; went from a simple word to a mystique. Today&#x27;s Six Sigma and lean manufacturing could be seen as new kinds of scientific management, although their evolutionary distance from the original is so great that the comparison might be misleading. In particular, Shigeo Shingo, one of the originators of the Toyota Production System, believed that this system and Japanese management culture in general should be seen as a kind of scientific management. These newer methods are all based on systematic analysis rather than relying on tradition and rule of thumb.

Other thinkers, even in Taylor&#x27;s own time, also proposed considering the individual worker&#x27;s needs, not just the needs of the process. Critics said that in Taylorism, &quot;the worker was taken for granted as a cog in the machinery.&quot; James Hartness published &quot;The Human Factor in Works Management&quot; in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management (founded by the work of Elton Mayo) evolved in the 1930s as a counterpoint or complement of scientific management. Taylorism focused on the organization of the work process, and human relations helped workers adapt to the new procedures. Modern definitions of &quot;quality control&quot; like ISO-9000 include not only clearly documented and optimized manufacturing tasks, but also consideration of human factors like expertise, motivation, and organizational culture. The Toyota Production System, from which lean manufacturing in general is derived, includes &quot;respect for people&quot; and teamwork as core principles.

Peter Drucker saw Frederick Taylor as the creator of knowledge management, because the aim of scientific management was to produce knowledge about how to improve work processes. Although the typical application of scientific management was manufacturing, Taylor himself advocated scientific management for all sorts of work, including the management of schools, universities and government. For example, Taylor believed scientific management could be extended to &quot;the work of our salesmen&quot;. Shortly after his death, his acolyte Harlow S. Person began to lecture corporate audiences on the possibility of using Taylorism for &quot;sales engineering&quot; (Person was talking about what is now called sales process engineering—engineering the processes that salespeople use—not about what we call sales engineering today.) This was a watershed insight in the history of corporate marketing.

===In the 2000s===
Google&#x27;s methods of increasing productivity and output can be seen to be influenced by Taylorism as well. The Silicon Valley company is a forerunner in applying behavioral science (such as the motivations of purpose, mastery, and autonomy set out by Daniel Pink in his 2009 book &quot;&quot;) to increase knowledge worker productivity. In classic scientific management as well as approaches like lean management where leaders facilitate and empower teams to continuously improve their standards and values. Leading high-tech companies use the concept of nudge management to increase productivity of employees. More and more business leaders start to make use of this new scientific management.

Today&#x27;s militaries employ all of the major goals and tactics of scientific management, if not under that name. Of the key points, all but wage incentives for increased output are used by modern military organizations. Wage incentives rather appear in the form of skill bonuses for enlistments.

Scientific management has had an important influence in sports, where stop watches and motion studies rule the day. (Taylor himself enjoyed sports, especially tennis and golf. He and a partner won a national championship in doubles tennis. He invented improved tennis racquets and improved golf clubs, although other players liked to tease him for his unorthodox designs, and they did not catch on as replacements for the mainstream implements).

Modern human resources can be seen to have begun in the scientific management era, most notably in the writings of Katherine M. H. Blackford.

Practices descended from scientific management are currently used in offices and in medicine (e.g. managed care) as well.

In countries with a post-industrial economy, manufacturing jobs are a relatively few, with most workers in the service sector. One approach to efficiency in information work is called digital Taylorism, which uses software to monitor the performance of employees who use computers all day.

<text>Mario D&#x27;Agata (29 May 1926 – 4 April 2009) was an Italian professional boxer, who was the first, and so far only, deaf world champion in boxing. He was a lineal, European, and Italian bantamweight champion.

==Early life==
D&#x27;Agata was born on 29 May 1926, in Arezzo, Italy. He had a tough childhood as a consequence of his disabilities, the victim of taunting from fellow school children. Feeling the need to prove himself equal, he resorted to street fighting as a way to demonstrate his equality. D&#x27;Agata was one of three children (out of seven) to be born deaf in his family. His parents moved him from Tuscany to Rome at an early age, hoping to find doctors who would cure him.

One afternoon he noticed a poster of a boxer adorning the door to a boxing gym. Upon entering he was enamored with how the boxers practiced their fighting in a polished, stylized way. D&#x27;Agata was drawn into boxing from that moment on. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, however, D&#x27;Agata had to wait until he was 20 years old to fight as an amateur. In 1946, he began an amateur career that saw him win 90 out of 110 bouts.

==Professional career==
On 14 October 1950, D&#x27;Agata turned professional, defeating Giuseppe Saladari by a decision in six rounds. He built a record of 10–0 with 1 knockout before suffering his first loss, at the hands of Romolo Re, 2 August 1951, by a decision in ten. Another loss to Re would follow, but D&#x27;Agata was able to build a 19–3–2 record with 4 knockouts before challenging for the Italian bantamweight title, on 26 September 1953, beating Gianni Zuddas by a disqualification in round nine to claim the belt. After five more wins, he travelled to Tunisia, where he met the future world champion Robert Cohen, losing a ten-round decision. After two more wins, he embarked on what would have been a long tour of Australia, a trip cut short after three wins when he was shot by his associate.

D&#x27;Agata then returned to Italy, where he was no longer recognized as champion. On 25 May 1955, he defeated Arthur Emboule by decision in eight rounds, in his first bout after the shooting. After eight more wins in a row (which raised his winning streak to a total of thirteen wins in a row), he was given a shot at the European bantamweight title by Andre Valignat on 29 October of the same year, and he defeated Valignat by a fifth round disqualification.

On 29 June 1956, D&#x27;Agata finally received his world title opportunity, when former conqueror Cohen gave him a chance to win the world bantamweight title in Rome. D&#x27;Agata made his dream come true by knocking Cohen out in six rounds in front of 38,000 fans, many of whom rushed to the ring the moment the fight was over, carrying D&#x27;Agata out of the ring on their arms. With that win, D&#x27;Agata made history as the first deaf world champion of boxing.

D&#x27;Agata went to Paris to defend his title for the first time, on 1 April 1957, against local challenger Alphonse Halimi. Special lights had been set specially for this fight, so that D&#x27;Agata, who could not hear the bell after each round, would be able to tell when each round was finished. These lights would flash the moment the bell rang. There was a storm on the day of the fight, which was held in an open-air area. Lightning struck one of the special lights in round three, and D&#x27;Agata was struck by sparkles, suffering a burned neck and back. It was decided the fight would go on, and D&#x27;Agata tried to defy the odds for the remaining of the fight, but he lost the title by a fifteen-round decision.

D&#x27;Agata never received a rematch from Halimi. He then fought on with mixed success, until 1 August 1962, when he announced his retirement. He was able to stay away from boxing for the rest of his life.

==Legacy==
D&#x27;Agata became an example to many in his native Italy, where some boxing fans still regard him as a hero. In addition to enduring disabilities, he also survived an attempt on his life before becoming a world champion, after being shot in the chest by a business partner in Australia, on 12 February 1955. This cost him a shot at the world bantamweight title, at the time held by Raul Macias.

<doc id="389419" wikidata="Q6538597" url="?curid=389419" title="Li'l Abner (musical)">
<text>Li&#x27;l Abner is a 1956 musical with a book by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, music by Gene De Paul, and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. Based on the comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; by Al Capp, the show is, on the surface, a broad spoof of hillbillies, but it is also a pointed satire on other topics, ranging from American politics and incompetence in the United States federal government to propriety and gender roles.

After several other writers and composers considered musicalizing the comic strip, Al Capp finally made a deal in 1955 with the eventual creators for a musical to be financed by Paramount Pictures, which wanted to follow the stage version with a film musical. The Broadway production opened on November 15, 1956, and ran for a moderately successful 693 performances. The score and Michael Kidd&#x27;s choreography received critical praise, but some critics felt that the book&#x27;s adaptation lost the spirit of the comic strip. Kidd and Edie Adams, as Daisy Mae, won Tony Awards, while newcomer Peter Palmer, in the title role, won a Theatre World Award. Paramount released a film version with the same title in 1959, with most of the Broadway cast reprising their roles.

==History==
A musical version of the popular comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was first planned in 1946, with the book to be written by the comic strip&#x27;s author, Al Capp. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were named as potential producers, though reports did not state whether they intended to write the score. However, this version never materialized, and over the next several years, various authors and composers sought to musicalize &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, including writers Arnold Horwitt and Josh Logan.

In 1953, Arthur Schwartz and Alan Jay Lerner obtained the rights to the show from Al Capp; the three were to co-produce the show, with Schwartz writing the music and Lerner writing the book and lyrics for an opening during the 1954–55 season. The familiar comic strip characters were to be retained but Li&#x27;l Abner and his longtime sweetheart Daisy Mae would not yet be married in the musical. Hollywood star Van Johnson expressed interest in the title role, saying he would dye his hair black to match the comic strip character; he had not appeared on Broadway since the 1940 production of &quot;Pal Joey&quot;.

The Schwartz–Lerner version also fell through, but by the next year Lerner and composer Burton Lane planned to write the musical. Herman Levin would serve as producer, and rehearsals were scheduled to begin in November 1954. However, later that year, Levin announced a musical version of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, by Lerner and Loewe. Although work was supposed to continue on the Lane–Lerner &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, this version never appeared, and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, opened in 1956, becoming the hit musical of the decade.

In 1955, Norman Panama and Melvin Frank announced a &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; musical to open on Broadway in 1956, followed by a film of the musical. The music was to be written by Gene de Paul with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. De Paul and Mercer had previously written the score for the popular movie musical, &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;. Michael Kidd, who had choreographed &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;, was to direct and choreograph &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. Al Capp approved the production and was to receive a share of any profits. Paramount Pictures was the sole backer of the musical and also paid $300,000 for its film rights, with Panama and Frank slated to adapt, direct, and produce the film version.

The producers conducted a long search for the actor to play the title role: over 400 actors auditioned for the part, and at one time, Dick Shawn was reported to be their preferred choice. However, the producers eventually chose unknown singer Peter Palmer, who had been serving in an army entertainment unit; Panama and Frank saw him perform on a segment of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; featuring talented American soldiers. Palmer was a trained singer with a music degree from the University of Illinois, where he had also played football; at 6&#x27;4&quot; and 228 pounds, Palmer had the right &quot;look&quot; to play Li&#x27;l Abner. He was 15 years younger than Van Johnson, who had expressed an interest in the role.

The leading female role, Daisy Mae, was relatively easier to cast. The producers knew that they wanted soprano Edie Adams, who had given a star-making performance as Eileen in the 1953 musical &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;. Adams, however, had also been offered the lead role in the original production of &quot;Candide&quot;. Adams asked director George Abbott, who had directed her in &quot;Wonderful Town&quot;, which show she should choose, and he advised her to take Daisy Mae, which she subsequently did. Coincidentally, Al Capp had been one of the three judges for the &quot;Miss U.S. Television&quot; contest broadcast on the DuMont Television Network in 1950 that first brought Adams national attention.

==Synopsis==

===Act One===
&quot;It&#x27;s a Typical Day&quot; as the citizens of Dogpatch, U.S.A. go about their daily activities. As usual, sweet, curvaceous Daisy Mae Scragg is pursuing Li&#x27;l Abner Yokum who, despite being a strapping, handsome young man, isn&#x27;t interested in girls or employment. Abner&#x27;s domineering, diminutive Mammy sends Daisy Mae to tell Abner to come to the Cornpone Meetin&#x27; in the town square. At the fishing hole with his friends, Abner lazily reflects that if he could be anyone in the world, he&#x27;d rather be himself (&quot;If I had my Druthers&quot;). Daisy Mae tells the young men about the meeting, and they rush into town. Daisy is frustrated because Abner has failed to take any romantic interest in her (&quot;If I Had My Druthers&quot; (reprise)).

The townspeople assemble for the Cornpone Meetin&#x27;, where parson Marryin&#x27; Sam leads a celebration of Dogpatch&#x27;s founder, &quot;Jubilation T. Cornpone&quot;, a bumbling Confederate general whose leadership was more beneficial to the North than to the South. Senator Fogbound, Dogpatch&#x27;s U.S. congressman, tells the citizens that Congress has declared Dogpatch the most unnecessary town in the U.S., and so it must be evacuated to be used as a nuclear bomb test site to be overseen by Dr. Finsdale, a government scientist. Everyone is thrilled that Dogpatch has been picked out of the entire U.S. (&quot;Rag Offen the Bush&quot;).

But Earthquake McGoon reminds them that if they leave Dogpatch, the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race won&#x27;t take place: in Dogpatch, the only way anyone can be married is if a young woman catches a boy on Sadie Hawkins Day. Daisy Mae&#x27;s sleazy unscrupulous relative, Romeo Scragg, gives Earthquake permission to marry Daisy Mae (in exchange for a $1 bribe). The townspeople decide to save Dogpatch and Sadie Hawkins Day by proving there is something necessary in the town. Daisy Mae asks Abner if he will let her catch him on Sadie Hawkins Day and tries to persuade him that he deserves to marry a girl like her, and Abner agrees that she should marry a boy like him (&quot;Namely You&quot;). The townspeople lament that their beloved home has been declared an &quot;Unnecessary Town&quot; as Dr. Finsdale declares all of their attempts to prove their worth were in vain.
It turns out that Mammy Yokum&#x27;s Yokumberry Tonic, which she makes from the one-of-a-kind Yokumberry tree growing outside her home, is what has made Abner so strong and handsome.

When a short, pudgy government scientist is given a spoonful, he turns into a tall, muscular man. Abner also agrees to go to Washington, accompanied by Marryin&#x27; Sam, to allow Dr. Finsdale and the government to test the tonic on the scrawny men of Dogpatch. There, greedy, tyrannical General Bullmoose wants to buy the formula for Yokumberry Tonic, and he is angry that Li&#x27;l Abner intends to turn the formula over to the government for free (&quot;What&#x27;s Good for General Bullmoose&quot;). He hatches a dastardly scheme in which his girlfriend, femme fatale Appassionata Von Climax, will catch Abner on Sadie Hawkins Day. Once they&#x27;re married, Bullmoose will kill Abner, and the formula will belong to his widow, Appassionata.

Abner and Marryin&#x27; Sam return to Dogpatch with the happy news that &quot;The Country&#x27;s In the Very Best of Hands&quot;. On Sadie Hawkins Day, General Bullmoose and Appassionata arrive in Dogpatch. They hire Evil Eye Fleagle to help Appassionata catch Abner. The race begins, and the young women of Dogpatch pursue the young men (&quot;Sadie Hawkins Day&quot; ballet). Though Daisy Mae, with the help of Stupefyin&#x27; Jones (any man who looks at her freezes), almost succeeds in catching Abner, Evil Eye Fleagle uses his evil eye to freeze everyone in the race, and Appassionata calmly walks up to Abner and claims him as hers.

===Act Two===
In Washington, Dr. Finsdale and the scientists testing Yokumberry Tonic dream of a time when life will be totally controlled by science (&quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;). In Dogpatch, Daisy Mae concludes that the reason she couldn&#x27;t win Abner is that she, at age seventeen, is too old and no longer beautiful, and Marryin&#x27; Sam joins her lament (&quot;I&#x27;m Past My Prime&quot;). Mammy Yokum has a vision in which she sees Bullmoose and Appassionata&#x27;s plot to kill Li&#x27;l Abner. Daisy Mae asks Earthquake McGoon to go to Washington, D.C. to save Li&#x27;l Abner, promising to marry him if he does.

In Washington, an engagement party is being held for Li&#x27;l Abner and Appassionata. General Bullmoose has Evil Eye Fleagle on hand; since Fleagle&#x27;s evil eye can require him to do anything requested, Appassionata won&#x27;t even have to marry Abner to get the formula. The General is planning to simply have Fleagle use his eye on Abner, get the formula for Yokumberry Tonic, and then order Abner to commit suicide. Mammy and Pappy Yokum, Earthquake, Daisy Mae, and the ladies of Dogpatch all show up to sabotage the party. When Fleagle tries to use his evil eye on Abner, Earthquake holds up a mirrored serving tray to protect himself, and the beam from Fleagle&#x27;s eye bounces off the tray and rebounds onto General Bullmoose. Mammy Yokum questions the General, and he reveals the entire plot. The police arrest him and Appassionata.

The women of Dogpatch go to the laboratory to see the results of Yokumberry Tonic. Their scrawny husbands have been transformed into handsome men, but they have no interest in their wives. Dr. Finsdale explains that this is an unfortunate side effect of the tonic: it kills men&#x27;s romantic interests. The women beg for him to &quot;Put &#x27;Em Back&quot; the way they were before they took the tonic. Daisy tells Abner that she&#x27;s promised to marry Earthquake since he came to Washington and saved Abner, but she&#x27;d rather marry Abner (&quot;Namely You&quot; (reprise)). Softspoken Pappy Yokum tells Abner that he has a secret potion which will make Abner want to marry Daisy Mae. Abner agrees to take it once they get back to Dogpatch.

Back in Dogpatch, Marryin&#x27; Sam is officiating at Daisy Mae and Earthquake&#x27;s wedding. Before the wedding, Daisy introduces her filthy relatives to Earthquake, saying that they&#x27;ll be coming to live with them once they are married. Marryin&#x27; Sam begins the ceremony by warning Earthquake of the potential consequences of marriage (&quot;The Matrimonial Stomp&quot;). Abner and Pappy interrupt the ceremony, and Abner takes the potion (Pappy whispers to Mammy that it&#x27;s really just water) and declares that he wants to marry Daisy Mae. Earthquake now happily relinquishes Daisy Mae to marry Abner instead. Dr. Finsdale arrives, warning that the atomic bombs will arrive soon. As the townspeople try to move the town&#x27;s statue of Jubilation T. Cornpone, a plaque bearing a declaration by Abraham Lincoln is revealed: because Cornpone&#x27;s military blunders almost single-handedly allowed the North to win the Civil War, Dogpatch is designated a national shrine. Dr. Finsdale cancels the bombings, the scrawny men of Dogpatch return home to their happy wives, and the citizens of Dogpatch honor Jubilation T. Cornpone as Abner kisses Daisy Mae (Finale).

==Productions==

The Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd and orchestrated by Philip J. Lang, opened on November 15, 1956, at the St. James Theatre where it ran for 693 performances. Alvin Colt designed the costumes, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Costume Design. The wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida.

In 1998, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was presented in concert as part of the New York City Center&#x27;s &quot;Encores!&quot; series.

Goodspeed Musicals in East Haddam, Connecticut, presented the musical from April 21 to July 2, 2006. The production was updated to contemporary times and included references to Martha Stewart, Donald Trump, and Al Sharpton, among others, and the actor who played General Bullmoose was a Dick Cheney (at the time the U.S. vice president) look-alike.

&quot;Reprise! Broadway&#x27;s Best&quot; produced the musical in Los Angeles in February 2008.

==Film and television==

A film based on the stage musical was made by Paramount and released in 1959, with most of the Broadway cast reprising their roles. The film was shot to resemble a stage set, with the buildings and surroundings in two-dimensions, giving the sense of a &quot;proscenium dividing audience and performer&quot;.

A TV adaptation was produced in 1971 starring Ray Young as Li&#x27;l Abner, Nancee Parkinson as Daisy Mae, Billy Bletcher as Pappy Yokum, Donald O’Connor as General Bullmoose and Billie Hayes, reprising her role as Mammy Yokum, which she had played in the 1959 film version.

==Response==

===Critical reception===
;1956 Original Broadway Production
The 1956 original Broadway production opened to great praise for Michael Kidd&#x27;s choreography, and the score was generally well received. However, some critics thought that the creators of the musical had not effectively translated the original comic strip to the stage, and there was some critical disagreement about whether the satirical elements were effective. In the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, for example, Walter Kerr praised Kidd&#x27;s direction and choreography, saying that Kidd &quot;knows how to set fists and feet pounding against the floor. ... Every time he does it the air sizzles and crackles&quot;. He also praised the score, stating, &quot;Every time ... the orchestra strikes up for one of Johnny Mercer&#x27;s and Gene de Paul&#x27;s salutes to comic-strip fury, the beat is driving, the voices are clamoring. ... It&#x27;s all done with zip and zingo&quot;. John Chapman of the &quot;Daily News&quot; found &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; very enjoyable, stating, &quot;I decided I was going to like it all very much soon after the curtain rose and this fetching little Edith Adams sidled up to this big hunk, Peter Palmer, and said, shyly, &#x27;Abner, I brought you some worms.&#x27; There is a cast which is as remarkable for its ability to entertain as for its picturesqueness&quot;. He praised the satirical lyrics, stating, &quot;Johnny Mercer&#x27;s lyrics bring to mind the salty and saucy days of Lorenz Hart and Ira Gershwin [as they] jab at our personal and national foibles&quot;.

Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded Michael Kidd&#x27;s choreography, stating, &quot;If everyone in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; were as talented as Michael Kidd, everything would be as brilliant as the ballets, and probably the world would be gayer, too. But it is difficult to make a fluent musical romance out of some characters who may have hearts of gold but are not very bright in the upper story&quot;. Atkinson thought the book of the musical was inferior to the choreography, stating that the book did &quot;not have the lightness, simplicity, and speed of the Dogpatch folks. ... Mr. Kidd has caught the spirit of Dogpatch civilization brilliantly enough to suggest that ballet is a more suitable medium than words for animating Al Capp&#x27;s cartoon drawings&quot;.

Tom Donnelly of the &quot;New York World-Telegram &amp; Sun&quot; thought that the production had not retained the spirit of the comic strip, stating, &quot;Those aren&#x27;t real Dogpatch people stompin&#x27; and whompin&#x27; and cavortin&#x27; across that stage. Those are (sob!) Broadway actors done up in funny looking costumes&quot;. He also thought that too much of the libretto was spent explaining the Dogpatch milieu, which Donnelly assumed would be familiar to most audience members since &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was at that time a very popular comic strip. Conversely, John McClain of the &quot;New York Journal American&quot; thought the show would have been incomprehensible to anyone not already familiar with the comic strip. McClain also thought the show&#x27;s political satire was of &quot;questionable taste&quot;, asserting, &quot;it&#x27;s poor timing to feature a song about &#x27;The Country&#x27;s in the Very Best of Hands&#x27;, which attempts to show it isn&#x27;t, and to haul out and shove all over the stage that dreary caricature of a relentless millionaire&quot;. However, McClain still concluded, &quot;it is sure to be a great big hit. &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; is bountiful, lively, and tuneful&quot;.

;1998 Encores! Production
In his review of the 1998 &quot;Encores!&quot; production, Anthony Tommasini of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the production, calling it a &quot;stylish revisiting&quot;, saying, &quot;everything we have come to expect of [the &quot;Encores!&quot; series] is in evidence here: a fresh faced, multitalented cast; imaginative staging from the director, Christopher Ashley; careful attention ... to recreating the original orchestrations; stylish playing from the band, and wonderfully kinetic choreography&quot;. However, Tommasini thought the show itself was flawed, pronouncing the book &quot;dated-on-arrival&quot; and saying, &quot;Even in 1956 it must have been hard to find much satirical humor in [the plot]. Today it&#x27;s downright creepy&quot;. He conceded that &quot;the Mercer–De Paul has some tuneful gems&quot; but opined that &quot;Mercer&#x27;s witty lyrics create a paradox for the actors: characters who sing clever lyrics inevitably sound clever. ... So the score undermines the dimwitted characterizations&quot;. Irv Lichtman of &quot;Billboard&quot; favorably reviewed both the production and the show itself, saying the performance exemplified Encores&#x27; &quot;utterly delightful, right-on-the-mark performances&quot;. He wrote, &quot;The successful but largely forgotten 1956 musical &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; is certainly not a dud, for it has good-natured energy and a bright and tuneful score by Gene DePaul and Johnny Mercer ... the show serves well as one of those solid &quot;knockabout&quot; shows Broadway turned out with regularity through the &#x27;50s&quot;. He praised the &quot;playful zest&quot; of the characterizations and &quot;fine re-creations of the original choreography&quot;.

;2006 Goodspeed Revival
In &quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the 2006 Goodspeed production, Anita Gates generally approved of the new topical references added to the show, noting that &quot;Scott Schwartz&#x27;s colorful new production at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam has updated some of the political references, but the show&#x27;s message – typified by the gullible Dogpatchers&#x27; song &quot;The Country&#x27;s in the Very Best of Hands&quot; – remains the same&quot;. Gates stated that &quot;the musical is cartoonish by definition and hardly one of Broadway&#x27;s great treasures, but the show grows on you&quot;, opining that &quot;most of the Johnny Mercer–Gene de Paul songs are forgettable, but &quot;Namely Me&quot; ... stands out&quot;. Frank Rizzo of &quot;Variety&quot; was more critical of the production, declaring, &quot;even cartoon characters with a diminishing fan base should be shown some respect. This production, helmed with ever-increasing doses of exaggeration by Scott Schwartz, pushes the idiot quotient to new levels and overwhelms the piece&#x27;s playful political commentary&quot;. He praised the show itself, asserting that it contained &quot;many Mercer–de Paul gems in a tuneful, bright score&quot;. Rizzo stated that updating &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was &quot;not a bad idea, given that there are perennial themes ... that fit into today&#x27;s social zeitgeist&quot;, but he thought that the updates had not been applied consistently, as the show had retained many 1950s references.

<doc id="389420" wikidata="Q800618" url="?curid=389420" title="Chalfont &amp; Latimer station">
<text>Chalfont &amp; Latimer is a London Underground and National Rail station in Travelcard Zone 8 (previously zone C) on the Metropolitan line, in Buckinghamshire.
It also serves the Chiltern Railways line to Aylesbury. Chalfont &amp; Latimer station is located just before the junction for trains to Chesham.
The station serves Chalfont St Giles, Chalfont St Peter, Little Chalfont and Latimer. It is located in Little Chalfont. It opened as &quot;Chalfont Road&quot; on 8 July 1889 but changed to the present name from 1 November 1915. The station is a good location to alight from to explore the Chess Valley.

==History==

Chalfont &amp; Latimer station was formerly served by steam–hauled Metropolitan line trains with a changeover to an electric locomotive at Rickmansworth. The electrification north of Rickmansworth to Amersham and Chesham was completed in 1960, with steam trains being finally withdrawn in 1961. British Railways took over the operation of the service north of Amersham at the same time, using Class 115 diesel multiple unit trains. The station had a goods yard, which closed on 14 November 1966.

From 1961, Metropolitan line trains at Chalfont &amp; Latimer were formed of A60 and A62 Stock. Prior to 11 December 2010, the branch was served by a single four-car shuttle train (using Chalfont &amp; Latimer station&#x27;s bay platform), except for two through trains in either direction during peak periods. From 12 December 2010, the Chesham service now consists of half hourly direct services formed of eight car S Stock trains being introduced at that time. Chiltern Railways (Aylesbury-Marylebone) trains are formed by Class 165 and Class 168 diesel multiple units.

On the up, south-bound, platform there is one of the few surviving K8 telephone kiosks. Now used for the TfL internal system, the kiosk is Grade II listed

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch report considered the likely cause of the incident was driver fatigue.

<text>Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book is a humour book comprising mostly material derived and reworked from the first two series of the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; BBC television series. Edited by Eric Idle, it was first published in the UK in 1971 by Methuen Publishing Ltd. It was later published in the United States in 1975 by Warner Books.

As well as the comedy content, the title itself is a humorous reference to Mao Zedong&#x27;s &quot;Little Red Book&quot;— despite the title, the book has a blue cover. To add to the confusion, the credits page refers to it as &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Brown Book&quot;.

The book contains some stills of footage shot for &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot; but not used, including &quot;Ken Shabby&quot; and &quot;Le Pouff Celebre/Flying Sheep&quot;.

Shortly after publication the book ran into trouble when a music publishing company objected to the use of their trade name being used on the &quot;Bing Tiddle Tiddle Bong&quot; sheet music. After the first 75,000 copies were sold, all subsequent editions removed the reference to &quot;The Wright Ukulele Tutor&quot; and replaced it with &quot;The Volti Subito&quot;.

In 1972 a paperback edition was issued with the words &quot;Special New Hardback Edition&quot; replacing the &quot;Very Urgent&quot; sticker on the front cover. In 1981 both this book and &quot;The Brand New Monty Python Bok&quot; were reissued as a hardback book entitled The Complete Works Of Shakespeare And Monty Python: Volume One – Monty Python. Paperback editions of both these books were reissued again in 1986 as The Monty Python Gift Boks, sold together inside an outer cover which folded out into a mini poster.

The concept of a drabble is said to have originated in UK science fiction fandom in the 1980s; the 100-word format was established by the Birmingham University SF Society, taking a term from Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book. In the book, &quot;Drabble&quot; was described as a word game where the first participant to write a novel was the winner. In order to make the game possible in the real world, it was agreed that 100 words would suffice. French writer Félix Fénéon may be considered as a precursor with his &quot;nouvelles en trois lignes&quot; (three lines short stories), inspired by new items.

In 2008 Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book was referenced in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Silence in the Library&quot;.

<text>Chalfont St Giles is a village and civil parish in southeast Buckinghamshire, England. It is in a group of villages called The Chalfonts, which also includes Chalfont St Peter and Little Chalfont.

It lies on the edge of the Chiltern Hills, west-northwest of Charing Cross, central London, and near Seer Green, Jordans, Chalfont St Peter, Little Chalfont and Amersham. 

The cockney rhyming slang term &quot;chalfonts&quot;, meaning haemorrhoids (piles), is derived from the name of the village. The village has a duck pond that is fed by the River Misbourne. The village sign was designed and painted by Doreen Wilcockson ARCA in 2001. Chalfont St Giles is famous for the poet Milton’s only surviving home.

==History==
In the Domesday Book of 1086, Chalfont St Giles and Chalfont St Peter were listed as separate Manors with different owners, called &#x27;Celfunte&#x27;. They were separate holdings before the Norman Conquest.

The Church of England parish church of Saint Giles is of Norman architecture and dates from the 12th century. The church features a lychgate and wall paintings from the early 14th century. During the English Civil War, some iron cannonballs were embedded in the stonework around the east window; they were believed to have been fired by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s troops when camped in the neighbouring field after the Battle of Aylesbury. Three of these balls are now on display in John Milton&#x27;s Cottage in the village. Bishop Francis Hare is buried in his family mausoleum in the churchyard.
During the Great Plague of London in 1665, John Milton retired to Chalfont St Giles where he completed his epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Milton&#x27;s Cottage still stands in the village, and is open to the public. The inspiration for &quot;Paradise Regained&quot; is said to have been found in this parish from a conversation with a former pupil, Thomas Ellwood. In 1887, after an attempt was made to relocate the house to America and rebuild it there, a movement was begun locally to purchase the house by local public subscription. Queen Victoria headed the list with a gift of £20, a considerable amount at the time – approximately £2,360 as of 2016.

Like most other rural parishes, it managed its civil affairs through the vestry until the Local Government Act 1894 required all parishes of over 300 people to have a Parish council independent of the Church.
The village was the birthplace of cricketer J. T. Hearne, one of the greatest bowlers of the 1890s and 1900s, who died there in 1944, and of the actress Alexandra Gilbreath.

Notable residents of the village have included Ozzy Osbourne, Harry Golombek, Brian Connolly, Brian Cant, Chicane, Armando Iannucci, Noel Gallagher, and Nick Clegg who became the Liberal Democrats party leader in 2007 and Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2015.

The village has given its name to Chalfont, Pennsylvania, which is a borough in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

The Chiltern Open Air Museum, located immediately outside the parish boundary, rescues and re-erects historic buildings which face demolition, from medieval to modern. Its collection includes a cottage from around 1600, and a variety of 19th century buildings, within 45 acres of parkland.

The Buckinghamshire Building Society was founded in 1907 as the 
Chalfont &amp; District Permanent Building Society, and it continues to have its headquarters and sole branch in the village.

==Future==
High Speed 2 will pass underneath the village in the Chiltern tunnel. A ventilation shaft will be constructed near the village, disguised as a barn.

==Amenities==
The village is the closest to Hodgemoor Wood, a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The village is twinned with Graft-De Rijp, Netherlands.

===Education===
Chalfont St Giles Village School educates children between the ages of 3 to 7 (at an infant school and nursery) and 7 to 11 (at the junior school).

===Sport===
The local football club is Chalfont Wasps, which was promoted to the Hellenic Football League Premier Division for the 2008–09 season. They play their home games at &#x27;The Nest&#x27;. Chalfont St Giles has a tennis club, affiliated to the Lawn Tennis Association. The village is home to Oakland Park Golf Club, and nearby to Harewood Downs Golf Club.

The local cricket club is Chalfont St Giles CC, which plays in the Thames Valley Cricket League and Morrant Chiltern League. They play their home games at Bowstridge Lane in the heart of the village.

==Film and television==

Chalfont St Giles has been the location of several film and television programmes. It doubled as Walmington-on-Sea in the 1971 film version of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;. John Laurie, one of the main actors, lived in Chalfont St Peter. &quot;The Miller&#x27;s Tale&quot; episode of the BBC Television drama &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; was filmed in and around Chalfont St Giles as was an episode of the BBC Television sitcom &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;. It was the location for the filming of Episode 6 of Series 3 of &quot;Peep Show&quot;. A series 2 episode of the Channel 5 series No Place Like Home was predominantly filmed in Chalfont St Giles, with Fern Britton, a former resident, touring viewers around the village. The village hosted a 2015 episode of Storage Hunters UK.
The village is also mentioned in the series 3 episode of &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; entitled &quot;Bertie Sets Sail&quot;, when Bertie Wooster likens Lord Wilmot Pershaw&#x27;s demeanour to &quot;a wet weekend in Chalfont St. Giles&quot;. Other films and TV shows filmed in Chalfont St Giles include &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, and &quot;The Big Job&quot; (1965), starring Sid James and Dick Emery. The village is ideal for film production due to its close proximity to Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath, and London.

The Chalfont St Giles Community Library has featured twice on BBC&#x27;s The One Show; first in 2010 and for a second time in 2012. The segments highlighted the importance of the library to the community and how volunteers have helped keep it operational.

<text>Chalfont St Peter is a large village and civil parish in southeastern Buckinghamshire, England. It is in a group of villages called The Chalfonts which also includes Chalfont St Giles and Little Chalfont. The villages lie between High Wycombe and Rickmansworth. Chalfont St Peter is one of the largest villages, with nearly 13,000 residents. The urban population for Chalfont St Peter and Gerrards Cross is 19,622, the two places being considered a single area by the Office for National Statistics.

Gerrards Cross was once a hamlet in the parish of Chalfont St Peter, but became a village and civil parish in its own right and is now a town.

Chalfont St Peter is west-north-west of Charing Cross, central London and is also in close proximity to Heathrow Airport, Pinewood and Elstree film studios, and the motorway network (M25, and M40).

==History==

===Early history===
At the time of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; in 949 there was no distinction made between the three separate villages: the whole area was known as &quot;Ceadeles funtan&quot;, meaning &quot;chalk springs&quot;. The villages were however separated by 1237 when in manorial rolls Chalfont St Peter was referred to as &quot;Chalfund Sancti Petri&quot;. The suffix St Peter is taken from the dedication of the church in the village.
Chalfont St Peter was described in 1806 in &quot;Magna Britannia&quot; as follows:
:&quot;Chalfont St Peter, in the hundred and deanery of Burnham, lies about five miles from Amersham, on the road to London, and nearly six miles from Uxbridge in Middlesex. The manor, which belonged to Missenden Abbey, was granted in 1536 to Robert Drury, esquire, whose descendants sold it in 1626 to the Bulstrodes: in 1646 it was conveyed to Thomas Gower esq. of whom, in 1650, it was purchased by Mr. Richard Whitchurch, ancestor of Mrs. Anne Whitchurch, the present proprietor.

:&quot;An ancient manor in this parish takes its name from the family of Brudenell, (collateral ancestors of the Earl of Cardigan), who formerly possessed it; from them it descended by female heirs to the Drurys and Osbornes. It afterwards came into the Duke of Portland&#x27;s family, of whom it was purchased by Charles Churchill esq. the late proprietor; it is now the property of Thomas Hibbert esq. Mr. Hibbert&#x27;s seat, which is called Chalfont-house, was a distinct property; and before it came into Mr. Churchill&#x27;s hands, was in the families of Wilkins and Selman.
:&quot;Newlands, in this parish, the seat of Sir Henry Thomas Gott, was purchased by its present possessor about the year 1770, of Mr. Croke of Beaconsfield: it had been formerly in the family of Saunders, and was sold by Sir John Saunders to Mr. Hopkins, of whom it was purchased by Mr. Croke.

:&quot;In the church are memorials for the family of Whitchurch. The advowson and impropriation which belonged formerly to Missenden abbey, and afterwards to the Drurys, was given by Sir Thomas Allen to the president and scholars of St. John&#x27;s college in Oxford, who present the vicar and grant him a lease of the great tithes.
:&quot;The Earl of Portland built a school at Gerrard&#x27;s Cross, in this parish, adjoining the road from London to High Wycombe. It has no endowment, but has always been supported by the Portland family: the duke appoints the master, and allows him a salary for teaching a number of boys of this and some of the neighbouring parishes.
:&quot;William Courtnay, who died in 1770, gave a loaf of bread weekly to each of eleven unmarried poor women of this parish, and one to the clerk.&quot;

===Modern history===
Today, Chalfont St Peter is one of the largest villages in the United Kingdom partly due to the proximity to Gerrards Cross railway station which lies between London Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill on the Chiltern Main Line. Modern buildings and urbanisation now dominate the village centre and very little historic architecture remains. The first major development of the village were rows of Georgian shops (some of which still remain). Much larger developments came in the late 1920s and these shops that run up the main street towards Gold Hill common now comprise most of the village centre. Modernisation and urbanisation continued up until the 1960s when most of the Georgian shops were demolished in favour of a concrete development of flats, offices and shops fronts surrounding a central car park.

==Population==

Since the building of Gerrards Cross railway station in the late 19th century, the population of Chalfont St Peter has risen dramatically. From 1801 to 1901, the populations of the village only saw a 700-person rise – giving a population of 1700. But from 1901 to the present, it has become one of the largest villages in the United Kingdom, with nearly 13,000 inhabitants.

==Tourist attractions==
Chalfont St Peter is often described as the Gateway to the Chiltern Hills. It is not a major tourist centre but has many places to stay, the most notable being The Greyhound (former local court house where hangings took place), which is situated at the foot of the village on the banks of the River Misbourne. Nearby there are several manor houses of note, as well as many museums, cottages and parks. Milton&#x27;s Cottage in Chalfont St Giles, the Colne Valley regional park, Bekonscot Model Village, Chenies Manor House, the Chiltern Open Air Museum, Odds Farm Park, Cliveden, Dorney Court, Harrow Museum &amp; Heritage Centre, Royal Windsor Racecourse and Hughenden Manor are the nearest attractions to the village itself. The Chiltern Open Air Museum is situated mainly within the village.

<text>Little Chalfont is a village and civil parish in south-east Buckinghamshire, England. It is one of a group of villages known collectively as &quot;The Chalfonts&quot;, which also comprises Chalfont St Giles and Chalfont St Peter. Little Chalfont is located around east of Amersham and northwest of Charing Cross, central London.

==History==
Little Chalfont is a 20th-century creation triggered by the coming of the Metropolitan Railway. A station called Chalfont Road was opened in 1889 at the northernmost point of Chalfont St Giles Parish where the parishes of Amersham, Chenies, and Chalfont St Giles met. At that time, the area was remote from the centres of the villages and towns, and consisted of isolated farms and cottages, and did not have a specific name.

The coming of the railway eventually brought local housing development, and a community developed around the station, which was renamed Chalfont &amp; Latimer station in 1915, a name which it retains today.

The first appearance of the name Little Chalfont is in the minutes of the Chalfont St Giles Parish Council on 15 January 1925, when, at the request of the inhabitants, it was agreed that the group of houses near the station should be named Little Chalfont instead of &quot;Chalfont Road Village&quot;. For many years, Little Chalfont was split mainly in the Amersham Town Council area, and partly in Chalfont St Giles parish. Following a period of campaigning by local residents, the village was awarded separate Parish status in 2007. Most of the new Parish came from Amersham, but a small part (in area, rather larger in population) of Chalfont St Giles was also included.

==Transport==
Little Chalfont is served by Chalfont &amp; Latimer station, on the Metropolitan line of the London Underground and the London to Aylesbury Line of Chiltern Railways. There are also bus services to Amersham, Chesham and other surrounding towns and villages.

==Education==
There are three schools in Little Chalfont: two primary schools (Little Chalfont Primary School, and Chalfont Valley E-ACT Primary Academy (formerly Bell Lane Primary School)), and Dr Challoner&#x27;s High School - a girls&#x27; grammar school.

Little Chalfont Community Library was originally part of the Buckinghamshire County Library Service but is now run as a community library by local volunteers since 2007. It is one of the most successful community libraries in England.

==Community==

Little Chalfont Farmers Market was launched in September 2009 with the support of the Parish Council and local regeneration groups. The Farmers Market takes place in the Village Hall car park on the second Saturday of each month.

 Little Chalfont Nature Park is a 4.6 acre Nature Park with rare MG5 grassland / wildflower meadow and semi-natural woodland. It was purchased for and by the community and opened on 1 June 2016. It is freely open to visitors all year round from dawn until dusk.

Little Chalfont Community Association is active and organises the Annual Village Day.

==Landmarks==
Beel House is a Grade II listed 16th-century house on the edge of Little Chalfont. Originally owned by the Duke of Buckingham. It was the home of Mary Penington whose daughter Gulielma Springett married William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. Later residents include Dirk Bogarde, Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, and Robert Kilroy-Silk.

==Religion==
Little Chalfont is part of the Church of England parish of Chenies and Little Chalfont. In 1987, it joined with the neighbouring parishes of Latimer and Flaunden to form the Chenies Benefice. The parish church of St George&#x27;s is on White Lion Road.

St Aidan&#x27;s Roman Catholic church is on Finch Lane. It was opened in 1964, having been built on land bought from the Beel House estate.

Little Chalfont Methodist Church is on Chalfont Avenue. The original church building was opened in 1959. After the church was damaged by fire in 1993, the current church building was opened in 1996.

==Economy==
Little Chalfont is home to two industrial laboratories and an office development, part of GE Healthcare, originally the Radiochemical Centre, and then Amersham International. Recently, the building housing GE Healthcare, was acquired by Cytiva, rebranding the building.

<text>Fisherman&#x27;s Friend is a brand of strong menthol lozenges manufactured by the Lofthouse company in Fleetwood, Lancashire, England.
== History ==
Fisherman&#x27;s Friend was originally developed by pharmacist James Lofthouse in 1865 to relieve various respiratory problems suffered by fishermen working in the extreme conditions of the northern deep-sea fishing areas. Though he developed it as an extremely strong liquid remedy containing menthol and eucalyptus oil, Lofthouse later made the liquid into small lozenges, which were easier to transport and administer. According to the manufacturer, the fishermen began to refer to the lozenges as &quot;friends&quot;, hence the name.

The company expanded its reach after the 1963 marriage of Doreen and Tony Lofthouse, a grandson of the founder, following which Doreen became a director; it transitioned from direct sales to stocking by retailers and subsequently spread abroad, initially to Norway in 1974, and different flavours were added to appeal to regional tastes. The shape of the lozenges was reportedly based on the buttons of a dress worn by Mrs Lofthouse.

British prime minister Margaret Thatcher is said to have used the product when her throat became strained from public speaking. French president Emmanuel Macron uses them too: &quot;He finds his energy in &quot;les Fisherman&#x27;s&quot;, those lozenges which rip your throat out. He keeps them in his pockets and in the car-seats. When speaking publicly, he needs water, some slices of lemon and a small dish of Fisherman&#x27;s. During the Presidential campaign, he was reported to have devoured crates of them, delivered to his campaign headquarters.&quot;

The lozenges are relatively unchanged since their creation. The original paper packets later became foil-lined and packaged in a cardboard carton.

Lofthouse of Fleetwood has won the Queen&#x27;s Award to Industry for Export Achievement on three occasions.

<doc id="389446" wikidata="Q2802719" url="?curid=389446" title="Quainton">
<text>Quainton (formerly Quainton Malet) is a village and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, north-west of Aylesbury. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 1,295. The village has two churches (Anglican and Baptist), a school and one public house. The location means that while many commute to London, others are employed in neighbouring towns and villages.

Its name is Old English and means &quot;Queen&#x27;s Estate&quot; (&quot;cwen tun&quot;). It is not known to which queen this refers, but possibly the Queen was Edith, the wife of Edward the Confessor. Known as &quot;Fair Edith&quot; she held manors in this part of Buckinghamshire, including a hunting lodge at Mentmore. Edward the Confessor had a palace at nearby Brill.

The former suffix Malet refers to the Malet family who were lords of the manor from 1066 until about 1348. At least one member went on the crusades, and had associations with the Hospitallers, the organization credited with rebuilding Quainton church circa 1340. The Hospitallers erected the cross on the village green, the base and shaft of which still remain.

The village green in the centre of the village has grouped around it some of the half-timbered thatched cottages for which the village is known.

The parish church is dedicated to St Mary and the Holy Cross. It is a 14th-century building of the style of gothic architecture known as Decorated. The west tower was built later in the 15th century. The church contains many memorial brasses and sculpture, including the 1689 tomb of Sir Richard Winwood carved by Thomas Stayner. The stone effigies depict the deceased lying in full armour, while his widow, Ann, who paid for the tomb, rests beside him, half sitting regarding her husband. In the chancel are a reredos and sedilia by William White who was responsible for the heavy Victorian restoration and rebuilding of the chancel in 1877. The church also contains Victorian stained glass windows. Richard Brett, a former rector of Quainton and one of the translators of the King James Version of the Bible, is buried in the chancel.

Close by the church is the former rectory, a large house described by Pevsner as of vitreous red brick. The principal facade has a three–bayed centre and two canted bays. The house contains 16th-century linenfold panelling.

The Winwood Almshouses, still inhabited, were built to house the poor, their gothic style of architecture belying the construction date of 1687. They are a terrace of eight small cottages, one storey high with a row of dormers in the attics. These attic windows have alternating small and large gables. The terrace is decorated by two porches, with a plaque above. The almshouses are further adorned by diagonally placed chimney stacks.

One of the most visible buildings is the 70 ft high Quainton Windmill, built in 1830–32. Derelict for the greater part of the 20th century it was restored in 1997 and can grind wheat into flour. Further restoration continues.

The local headquarters for the RSPCA are in the parish, outside the village.

Quainton has a mix of old and new dwellings.

Located just out from Quainton beyond the church is what was, at one point, one of the largest beef cattle farms in Buckinghamshire, Denham Farm. This ceased being a going farm towards the end of 1990s and it is now a house. 

==Education==
Quainton Church of England Combined School is a mixed Church of England primary school. It is a voluntary controlled school, which takes children from 4 to 11. The school currently has around 185 pupils.

==Transport==
;Rail
Quainton&#x27;s nearest National Rail station is Aylesbury Vale Parkway, about 5 miles away. Quainton was once linked to London by train from Quainton Road station to Marylebone and Baker Street; in the opposite direction travel was available to Rugby, Verney Junction and elsewhere. Passenger services ceased in 1963, but trains from Aylesbury run to connect with events at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre at Quainton Road station on some Bank Holidays. The station was also once a junction for the light railway (closed in 1936), sometimes known as the Brill Tramway, connecting Quainton with Brill.

;Buses
Quainton is served by Red Rose&#x27;s 16 service between Aylesbury and Steeple Claydon via Aylesbury Vale Parkway station. There around 5 buses daily in each direction on Mondays to Fridays and a reduced service on Saturdays.

<text>A transverse flute or side-blown flute is a flute which is held horizontally when played. The player blows across the embouchure hole, in a direction perpendicular to the flute&#x27;s body length.

Transverse flutes include the Western concert flute, the Irish flute, the Indian classical flutes (the bansuri and the venu), the Chinese dizi, the Western fife, a number of Japanese fue, and Korean flutes such as daegeum, junggeum and sogeum.

<doc id="389458" wikidata="Q5078" url="?curid=389458" title="South Sulawesi">
<text>South Sulawesi () is a province in the southern peninsula of Sulawesi, Indonesia. The Selayar Islands archipelago to the south of Sulawesi is also part of the province. The capital and largest city is Makassar. The province is bordered by Central Sulawesi and West Sulawesi to the north, the Gulf of Bone and Southeast Sulawesi to the east, Makassar Strait to the west, and Flores Sea to the south.

The 2010 census estimated the population as 8,032,551, which makes South Sulawesi the most populous province on the island (46% of the population of Sulawesi is in South Sulawesi), and the sixth most populous province in Indonesia. At the 2020 Census, this had risen to 9,073,509, and the official estimate as of mid-2023 was 9,362,290 (comprising 4,651,180 males and 4,711,110 females). The main ethnic groups in South Sulawesi are the Buginese, Makassarese and Torajan. The economy of the province is based on agriculture, fishing, and the mining of gold, magnesium, iron, and other metals. The pinisi, a traditional Indonesian two-masted sailing ship, is still used widely by the Buginese and Makassarese, mostly for inter-insular transportation, cargo, and fishing purposes within the Indonesian archipelago.

During the golden era of the spice trade, from the 15th to 19th centuries, South Sulawesi served as the gateway to the Maluku Islands. There were several small kingdoms, including two prominent ones, the kingdom of Makassar and the Bugis kingdom Bone. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) began operating in the region in the 17th century. VOC later allied with the Bugis prince, Arung Palakka, and they defeated the kingdom of Makassar. The king of Makassar, Sultan Hasanuddin was forced to sign a treaty that greatly reduced the power of Bungaya Gowa.

==History==
Sulawesi was first inhabited by humans around 30,000 years ago. The archaeological remains of the earliest inhabitants were discovered in caves near limestone hills around Maros, about 30 km northeast of Makassar. Pebble and flake stone tools have been collected from the river terraces in the valley of Walanae, among Soppeng and Sengkang, including the bones from giant pig and elephant species that are now extinct. Handprint paintings, estimated to be around 35,000 to 40,000 years old, have been found in the Pettakere cave, located from the town of Maros and from Makassar.

The increase in commerce due to the rise of external demand for South Sulawesi rice encouraged major agricultural expansion and political centralization in the early 14th century. Swidden agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive wet rice cultivation, leading to a rise in population density. New settlements were founded in the interior part of the peninsula as pristine forests were cleared. These changes accompanied the rise of new interior agricultural policies, such as the Bugis chiefdoms of Boné and Wajoq, as well as the Makassar polity of Gowa.

By the early 16th century, Boné had assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula, while the Makassar twin kingdoms of Gowa and Talloq started to expand their influence throughout the western part. Their competition for hegemony over South Sulawesi caused Gowa-Talloq and Boné to clash in the 1560s.

In 1582, Boné, Soppéng, and Wajoq signed a mutual defense pact known as the Treaty of Timurung. The alliance also referred to as the &quot;Tellumpocco&quot; (&quot;Three Powers&quot;, lit. &quot;Three Peaks&quot;), sought to stop Gowa&#x27;s expansionism and to reclaim the autonomy of the Bugis polities under Gowa&#x27;s vassalage. Gowa&#x27;s campaigns against the alliance in 1582, 1585, and 1588 were all successfully repulsed, with another one in 1590 abandoned following the death of Gowa&#x27;s ruler. By the early 17th century, however, Gowa and Talloq had become the dominant powers in South Sulawesi as they supported international commerce and embraced Islam. Gowa waged successful campaigns against the Bugis kingdoms, defeating Soppéng in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Boné in 1611.

The Dutch East India Company (VOC) began operating in the region in the 17th century and saw the Kingdom of Gowa as an obstacle to its desire to control the spice trade in this area. VOC later allied with the Bugis prince, Arung Palakka, who was living in exile after the fall of the Bugis. After a year-long battle, they defeated the kingdom of Gowa. And the king of Gowa, Sultan Hasanuddin was forced to sign a treaty greatly reducing the power of Bungaya Gowa. Furthermore, Palakka became ruler in South Sulawesi.

A Bugis queen later emerged to lead the resistance against the Dutch, who were busy dealing with the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, but after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Dutch returned to South Sulawesi and eradicated the queen&#x27;s rebellion. However resistance of the Bugis people against colonial rule continued until 1905. In 1905, the Dutch also managed to conquer Tana Toraja.

Before the proclamation of the Republic of Indonesia, South Sulawesi consisted of several independent kingdoms territory and was inhabited by four ethnic groups namely the Buginese, Makassarese, Mandarese, and Torajan.

On June 16, 2022, a tornado struck the province, damaging 63 homes. One man died of a stress-induced medical issue during the tornado, but was not a direct tornado-related fatality.

==Geography==
South Sulawesi is located at 4°20&#x27;S 120°15&#x27;E and covers a land area of 45,330.55 square kilometres. The province is bordered by Central Sulawesi and West Sulawesi to the north, the Gulf of Bone and Southeast Sulawesi to the east, Makassar Strait to the west, and Flores Sea to the south.

== Government and administrative divisions ==
Five years after independence, the government issued Law No. 21 of 1950, which became the basis of the legal establishment of what was then the Sulawesi province. Ten years later, the government passed Law No. 47 of 1960 which endorsed the formation of the South/Southeast Sulawesi province. Four years after that, with Act No. 13 of 1964, the provinces of South Sulawesi and Southeast Sulawesi were separated. Forty years later, the South Sulawesi government was split into two, with the regencies of Majene, Mamasa, Mamuju, Pasangkayu, and Polewali Mandar being separated off into a new West Sulawesi province on 5 October 2004 under Act No. 26 of 2004.

The remaining South Sulawesi Province is divided into 21 regencies and three independent cities.

The province comprises three of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The South Sulawesi I Electoral District consists of 5 regencies (Bantaeng, Jeneponto, Takalar, Gowa, and Selayar Islands), together with the city of Makassar, and elects 8 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The South Sulawesi II Electoral District consists of 8 regencies (Bulukumba, Sinjai, Maros, Pangkajene and Islands, Barru, Bone, Soppeng, and Wajo), together with the city of Parepare, and elects 9 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The South Sulawesi III Electoral District consists of 8 regencies (Sidenrang Rappang, Pinrang, Enrekang, Luwu, Tana Toraja, North Toraja, North Luwu, and East Luwu), together with the city of Palopo, and elects 7 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. 

==Demographics==

===Ethnic groups===


South Sulawesi has a diverse range of ethnic groups. The main three are:
* The Buginese (&quot;Suku Bugis&quot;) are the largest ethnic group in South Sulawesi, comprising almost 4 million people. These people inhabit the middle of the southern peninsula of South Sulawesi. Many of these people have migrated to the outer islands around Sulawesi, even as far as Malaysia.
* The Makassarese (&quot;Suku Makassar&quot;) are the second largest ethnic group in South Sulawesi. Their language is Makassar. Makassar people inhabit the southern part of the southern peninsula of South Sulawesi including the Jeneponto, Takalar, Bulukumba, Bantaeng, Gowa and Maros Regencies, Pangkajene and Islands, and Makassar city. The total population is over 2 million people.
* The Torajan (&quot;Suku Toraja&quot;) are the indigenous ethnic group that inhabits the mountainous northern region of the province, comprising Tana Toraja (&quot;Land of Toraja&quot;) and North Toraja Regencies.

===Language===
There are various languages and dialects spoken in South Sulawesi. The majority of them belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of Austronesian languages. Below is the list of major languages spoken in the province.

* Makassarese is spoken in the southwestern part of the province, including the city of Makassar. It has a total of 2.1 million speakers.
* Buginese is spoken in an area stretching from Pinrang in the northwest to Bulukumba in the southeast. This language is the predominant language used by many communities in South Sulawesi. It is natively spoken by around 5 million people as a first language, plus 500,000 as second language speakers, making it one of the most widely spoken languages in both South Sulawesi and the island of Sulawesi.
* The Tae&#x27; language is mostly spoken in Tana Luwu, the region in the northeast of the province comprising the Luwu, North Luwu, and East Luwu Regencies, together with Palopo city. It had approximately 400,000 native speakers in 2020.
* The Toraja language is the native language of Tana Toraja, comprising Tana Toraja Regency and Toraja Utara Regency. It has a total of over 800,000 speakers.
* Mandar, Mamuju, and Pattae&#x27; are the languages spoken by the Mandar people in the province of West Sulawesi, especially in Mamuju, Polewali Mandar, Majene, and Pasangkayu Regencies. In addition to the core in the tribal areas, they are also scattered in coastal parts of South Sulawesi. It is spoken by around 400,000 people.
* The Duri language is a language spoken in the north of Mount Bambapuang, Enrekang, and into the border of Tana Toraja. There are an estimated around 130,000 native speakers. It is the prestige variety of the Massenrempulu languages.
* The Konjo language is divided into two groups: the Coastal Konjo language and the Highland Konjo language. The Coastal Konjo live in coastal areas, notably the Bulukumba area, in the southeastern corner of the southern part of the island of Sulawesi. The Mountain Konjo lives in the mountains of southeastern Sulawesi, around Bawakaraeng. It has a total of almost 300,000 native speakers.

In 2010 there were 3,921,543 males and 4,111,008 females with 1,848,132 housing units, with an average of 4.34 people per unit versus the national average of 3.86. Some 13.3 percent of the population was under the national poverty line.

* The Human Development Index (HDI) for South Sulawesi in 2008 reached 70.22.
* Life expectancy was 69.60 in 2008.
* The poor population was at 12.31 percent in 2009, amounting to 963.6 thousand persons.
* There was an unemployment rate of 8.90 percent in 2009, amounting to 296,559 people.

===Religion===
The main religion in South Sulawesi is Islam at 89.62% (7,200,938). Other major religions include Protestantism 7.62% (612,751), Roman Catholicism 1.54% (124,255), Buddhism 0.24% (19,867), Hinduism 0.72% (58,393), and Confucianism 0.004% (367).

==Economy==
The Sulawesi economy grew by 7.78 percent in 2008 and grew by 6.20 percent in 2009. Economic Growth in the First Quarter of 2010 reached 7.77 percent. The GDP in 2009 (ADHK) amounted to Rp 47.31 trillion and 99.90 Trillion (ADHB).

===Natural resources===
As one of the national rice granaries, South Sulawesi annually produces 2,305,469 tons of rice. Of that amount, rice designated for local consumption is around 884,375 tons and 1,421,094 tons of reserves remain for distribution to other eastern areas. Rice is even exported to Malaysia, to the Philippines, and Papua New Guinea. The locations of the largest rice production are in the Bone regency, in Soppeng, in Wajo, in Sidrap, in Pinrang, and Luwu (Bodowasipilu Area).

====Food====
In addition to corn, the South Sulawesi region also produces cassava, sweet potatoes, green beans, peanuts, and soybeans. Some luxuries such as hybrid coconuts, cocoa, coffee, pepper, vanilla, tea, cashews, and cotton are also produced. The Tata Guna Horan Agreement (TGHK) of 2004 protects a lot of the forest in South Sulawesi creating a limited output of timber-related products.

Tuna and snapper-grouper are caught in large proportions and seaweed is grown to eat. Farms also have all of the typical animals such as chickens, cows, pigs, goats, etc.

====Mining====

One of the factors that contributes to the high GRDP of South Sulawesi is the mining sector. Nickel, gold, magnesium, iron, granite, lead, and stone products are mined.
==Transportation==

Trans-Sulawesi Railway is being constructed. It will connect Makassar and Parepare. 44 km of the railway, connecting Barru to Palanro is targeted to operate in the end of 2018. The entire Makassar-Parepare railway, with a length of 150 km, will be completed in 2019.

Airports in South Sulawesi include Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport (Makassar), Palopo Lagaligo Airport (Palopo), Pongtiku Airport (Tana Toraja), and Haji Aroepala Airport (Selayar), Andi Jemma Airport (Masamba), Soroako Airport (Soroako).

Ports include Soekarno-Hatta (Makassar), Tanjung Ringgit (Palopo), Nusantara, (Pare-Pare) and Pattumbukang (Selayar).

==Culture==

===Philosophy===
* Siri Na Pacce (ᨔᨗᨑᨗ ᨊ ᨄᨌᨙ) is one cultural philosophy of the Bugis-Makassar Society which must be upheld. If one is a siri&#x27; na pacce (not a person), then that person does not exceed the behavior of animals, because it has no sense of shame, self-esteem, and social concerns. The people of Bugis-Makassar teach morality in the form of advice about decency, prohibition, and the rights and obligations that dominate human action to preserve and defend himself and his honor. They have a very strong relationship with the view of Islam in terms of spirituality, where the strength of the soul can conquer the body. The core concept of siri&#x27; na pacce covers all aspects of community life and is the identity of the Bugis-Makassar.
* Siri Nipakasiri (ᨔᨗᨑᨗ ᨊᨗᨄᨀᨔᨗᨑᨗ) occurs when someone insulted or treated someone outside the boundaries of reasonableness. Then he or his family had to enforce siri&#x27; (ᨔᨗᨑᨗ) to restore the honour that has been deprived of, if not it would be called &quot;mate siri&#x27; (ᨆᨈᨙ ᨔᨗᨑᨗ)&quot; or dead status and dignity as a human being. The Bugis-Makassar would rather die than live without siri&#x27;.
* Siri Masiri (ᨔᨗᨑᨗ ᨆᨔᨗᨑᨗ) is a way of life that intends to maintain, improve, or achieve a feat performed by earnest and hard.

===Traditional costume===
Baju Bodo (ᨅᨍᨘ ᨅᨚᨉᨚ) or Waju Tokko (ᨓᨍᨘ ᨈᨚᨀᨚ) is the traditional costume of the women. Baju Bodo is rectangular and is usually short sleeved. According to customs, every color of the clothes worn by women shows the age or the dignity of the wearer. Clothing is often used for ceremonies such as weddings. But now, Baju Bodo is worn in other events such as dance competitions or to welcome guests.

===Traditional dance===

The traditional dance in South Sulawesi is a combination of dance elements in the form of movement, music, lighting and fashion used by dancers. The combination tells the message about the story of the habits of the community in the past. Like there is a dance that tells about the war, an expression of community excitement and welcoming guests.

In this case, the Bugis-Makassar tribe, whose numbers dominate in representing dance styles in South Sulawesi. However, the Toraja also have many traditional dances that are ritualistic. Some Mandar tribes also inhabit this province and have their own uniqueness in the arts. The rest are tribes of Duri, Pattinjo, Maiwa, Endekan, Pattae, and Ammatoa Kajang, who also paint the distinctive art of South Sulawesi.

===Traditional ship===

The pinisi or phinisi (ᨄᨗᨊᨗᨔᨗ) is a traditional Indonesian two-masted sailing ship. It was mainly built by the Konjo tribe, a sub-ethnic group but was, and still is used widely by the Buginese and Makassarese, mostly for inter-insular transportation, cargo, and fishing purposes within the Indonesian archipelago.

The hull of the ships looks similar to that of a dhow while the fore-and-aft rigging is similar to that of western schooners, although it might be more correctly termed to resemble a ketch, as the front mast is the larger.
The large mainsails differ from western style gaff rigs though, as they often do not have a boom and the sail is not lowered with the gaff. Instead it is reefed towards the mast, much like a curtain, thus allowing the gaff to be used as deck crane in the harbor. The lower part of the mast itself may resemble a tripod or is made of two poles. Pinisi may be 20 to 35 meters long and can weigh up to 350 tons. The masts may be as high as 30 meters above the deck.

===Traditional houses===
South Sulawesi has three types of traditional houses. The most known are the &quot;Rumah Panggung&quot; (Balla/Bola) from Bugis Makassar and the Tongkonan from Toraja.
* Rumah Panggung ( Balla ᨅᨒ / Bola ᨅᨚᨒ ) Some of the considerations for the building of the house are should it face the sunrise, overlook a plateau, or overlook a cardinal direction.

Usually a good day or a month to build the house is determined by those who have the skill in that regard. Building the house is preceded by a ritual ceremony.

* Tongkonan is the traditional ancestral house, or rumah adat of the Torajan people. Tongkonan have a distinguishing boat-shaped and oversized saddleback roof. Like most of Indonesia&#x27;s Austronesian-based traditional architecture, tongkonan are built on piles. The construction of a tongkonan is laborious work and it is usually built with the help of all of one&#x27;s family members. In the original Toraja society, only nobles had the right to build tongkonan while commoners lived in smaller and less decorated homes called &quot;banua&quot;.

===Traditional food===
Rice and other crops such as bananas are abundant so almost all dishes are, like the Bugis Makassar cake, made from rice and bananas. Coastal areas of South Sulawesi eat Bolu (milkfish), Shrimp, Sunu (grouper), and Crab.

In South Sulawesi, the traditional food is diverse, ranging from soup to traditional cakes.

===Traditional game===
Mallogo is a traditional game similar to golf, played with a coconut shell and bamboo.

===Traditional weapons===

* Badik (ᨅᨉᨗ) or Kawali (ᨀᨓᨒᨗ) A badik is a knife with a specific form developed by the Bugis and Makassar. The Badik is sharp, single or double sided, and has a length of about half a meter. Like with a kris, the blade shape is asymmetric and often decorated with prestige. However, different from the kris, the badik never had a &quot;ganja&quot; (buffer strip). Some versions from Sulawesi are decorated with inlaid gold figure on the blade called jeko. The handle is made of wood, horn or ivory in a shape of a pistol grip at a 45° to 90° angle and is often decorated with carvings. From Sulawesi, the badik soon spread to neighbouring islands like Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and as far as the Malay Peninsula, creating a wide variety of badik according to each region and ethnic group.

As with other blades in the Malay Archipelago, traditionally-made badik are believed to be imbued with a supernatural force during the time of their forging. The pamor in particular is said to affect its owner, bringing either well-being and prosperity or misfortune and poverty. Aside from being used as a weapon and hunting tool, the badik is a symbol of cultural identity in Sulawesi. The Bugis and Makassar people still carry badik as part of their daily attire. The badik is worn on the right side, with the butt end of the handle pointing to the rear.

<text>Makassar ( ), formerly Ujung Pandang ( ), is the capital of the Indonesian province of South Sulawesi. It is the largest city in the region of Eastern Indonesia and the country&#x27;s fifth-largest urban center after Jakarta, Surabaya, Medan, and Bandung. The city is located on the southwest coast of the island of Sulawesi, facing the Makassar Strait.

Throughout its history, Makassar has been an important trading port, hosting the center of the Gowa Sultanate and a Portuguese naval base before its conquest by the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century. It remained an important port in the Dutch East Indies, serving Eastern Indonesian regions with Makassarese fishers going as far south as the Australian coast. For a brief period after Indonesian independence, Makassar became the capital of the State of East Indonesia, during which an uprising occurred.

The city&#x27;s area is , and it had a population of around 1.474 million (732,391 males and 742,002 females) in mid 2023 within Makassar City&#x27;s fifteen administrative districts. Its official metropolitan area, known as &quot;Mamminasata&quot;, with the addition of thirty-three further districts of neighbouring regencies, covers an area of and had a population of around 2,795,639 according to the mid 2023 official estimates.

According to the National Development Planning Agency, Makassar is one of the four main central cities of Indonesia, alongside Medan, Jakarta, and Surabaya.

According to Bank Indonesia, Makassar has the second-highest commercial property values in Indonesia, after Greater Jakarta.

==Names and etymology==
The name Makassar was long spelled &quot;Macassar&quot; in English and many other European languages, although the Portuguese spelled it &quot;Macáçar&quot; during their presence there in the 17th century.

The Dutch spelled the name both &quot;Makasser&quot; and &quot;Makassar&quot; during their rule over the city as part of the Dutch East Indies. With the independence following World War II, the Indonesians kept the Dutch spelling of &quot;Makassar&quot; with a double &#x27;s&#x27;, despite the fact that the Indonesian language does not have geminate consonants (although the Makassar and Bugis languages do).

On 1 September 1971, the city was renamed after a variant of the pre-colonial name of the city&#x27;s Fort Rotterdam, &quot;Ujung Pandang&quot; (Makassarese: &quot;Jumpandang&quot;).

The action was taken at the time Makassar was expanding from its original 21 km2 to encompass neighbouring regions to de-emphasise the ethnic connotations of the name, enlarged to its present area. Ujung Pandang remained locally unpopular and, on 13 October 1999, the name reverted to &quot;Makassar&quot; under President B. J. Habibie, himself a native of South Sulawesi.

In the local language, the city is known as &quot;Mangkasara′&quot;, written in the Lontara script traditionally used to write Makassarese as well as Buginese, which is also widely spoken in the city.

The adjective form of the city&#x27;s name and the eponymous ethnic group has varied over time. In English, &quot;Macassarese&quot;, &quot;Makassarese&quot;, and &quot;Macassan&quot; have all been used, although the latter is usually used in the historical context of trepangers in northern Australia (the Macassan contact with Australia) and may include people not from Makassar. More recently, forms such as &quot;Makasarese&quot; and simply &quot;Makasar&quot; (both with a single &#x27;s&#x27;) have appeared.

==History==
The trade in spices figured prominently in the history of Sulawesi, which involved frequent struggles between rival native and foreign powers for control of the lucrative trade during the pre-colonial and colonial period when spices from the region were in high demand in the West. Much of South Sulawesi&#x27;s early history was written in old texts that can be traced back to the 13th and 14th centuries.

Makassar is mentioned in the Nagarakretagama, a Javanese eulogy composed in 14th century during the reign of Majapahit king Hayam Wuruk. In the text, Makassar is mentioned as an island under Majapahit dominance, alongside Butun, Salaya and Banggawi.

===Makassarese kingdom===
The 9th King of Gowa Tumaparisi Kallonna (1512–1546) is described in the royal chronicle as the first Gowa ruler to ally with the nearby trade-oriented polity of Tallo, a partnership which endured throughout Makassar&#x27;s apogee as an independent kingdom. The center of the dual kingdom was at Sombaopu, near the then mouth of the Jeneberang River about 10 km south of the present city center, where an international port and a fortress were gradually developed. First Malay traders (expelled from their Melaka metropolis by the Portuguese in 1511), then Portuguese from at least the 1540s, began to make this port their base for trading to the Spice Islands (Maluku), further east.

The growth of Dutch maritime power over the spice trade after 1600 made Makassar more vital as an alternative port open to all traders, as well as a source of rice to trade with rice-deficient Maluku.

The Dutch East India Company (VOC) sought a monopoly of Malukan nutmeg and cloves and came close to succeeding at the expense of English, Portuguese and Muslims from the 1620s. The Makassar kings maintained a policy of free trade, insisting on the right of any visitor to do business in the city, and rejecting the attempts of the Dutch to establish a monopoly.

Makassar depended mainly on the Muslim Malay and Catholic Portuguese sailors communities as its two crucial economic assets. However the English East India Company also established a post there in 1613, the Danish Company arrived in 1618, and Chinese, Spanish and Indian traders were all important. When the Dutch conquered Portuguese Melaka in 1641, Makassar became the most extensive Portuguese base in Southeast Asia.

The Portuguese population had been in the hundreds but rose to several thousand, served by churches of the Franciscans, Dominicans and Jesuits as well as the regular clergy. By the 16th century, Makassar had become Sulawesi&#x27;s principal port and center of the powerful Gowa and Tallo sultanates which between them had a series of 11 fortresses and strongholds and a fortified sea wall that extended along the coast.

Portuguese rulers called the city &quot;Macáçar&quot;. Makassar was very ably led in the first half of the 17th century when it effectively resisted Dutch pressure to close down its trade to Maluku and made allies rather than enemies of the neighboring Bugis states. Karaeng Matoaya (c.1573–1636) was the ruler of Tallo from 1593, as well as Chancellor or Chief Minister (&quot;Tuma&#x27;bicara-butta&quot;) of the partner kingdom of Gowa. He managed the succession to the Gowa throne in 1593 of the 7-year-old boy later known as Sultan Alaud-din, and guided him through the acceptance of Islam in 1603, numerous modernizations in military and civil governance, and cordial relations with the foreign traders. The conversion of the citizens to Islam was followed by the first official Friday Prayer in the city, traditionally dated to 9 November 1607, which is celebrated today as the city&#x27;s official anniversary. John Jourdain called Makassar in his day &quot;the kindest people in all the Indias to strangers&quot;.

Matoaya&#x27;s eldest son succeeded him on the throne of Tallo, but as Chancellor, he had evidently groomed his brilliant second son, Karaeng Pattingalloang (1600–54), who exercised that position from 1639 until his death. Pattingalloang must have been partly educated by Portuguese, since as an adult he spoke Portuguese &quot;as fluently as people from Lisbon itself&quot;, and avidly read all the books that came his way in Portuguese, Spanish or Latin. A French Jesuit, Father Alexandre de Rhodes, described Pattingalloang&#x27;s passion for mathematics and astronomy, on which he pestered the priest endlessly, while even one of his Dutch adversaries conceded he was &quot;a man of great knowledge, science and understanding&quot;.

===Dutch colonial period===
After Pattingalloang&#x27;s death in 1654, a new king of Gowa, Sultan Hasanuddin, rejected the alliance with Tallo by declaring he would be his own Chancellor. Conflicts within the kingdom quickly escalated, the Bugis rebelled under the leadership of Bone, and the Dutch VOC seized its long-awaited chance to conquer Makassar with the help of the Bugis (1667–69).

Their first conquest in 1667 was the northern Makassar fort of Ujung Pandang, while in 1669 they conquered and destroyed Sombaopu in one of the greatest battles of 17th century Indonesia. The VOC moved the city center northward, around the Ujung Pandang fort they rebuilt and renamed Fort Rotterdam. From this base, they managed to destroy the strongholds of the Sultan of Gowa, who was then forced to live on the outskirts of Makassar. Following the Diponegoro War (1825–30), Prince Diponegoro was exiled to Fort Rotterdam until his death in 1855.

After the arrival of the Dutch, there was an important Portuguese community, also called a &quot;bandel&quot;, that received the name of Borrobos.

Around 1660 the leader of this community, which today would be equivalent to a neighbourhood, was the Portuguese Francisco Vieira de Figueiredo.

The character of this old trading center changed as a walled city known as Vlaardingen grew. Gradually, in defiance of the Dutch, the Arabs, Malays and Buddhist returned to trade outside the fortress walls and were joined later by the Chinese.

The town again became a collecting point for the produce of eastern Indonesia – the copra, rattan, Pearls, trepang and sandalwood and the famous oil made from bado nuts used in Europe as men&#x27;s hairdressing – hence the anti-macassars (embroidered cloths protecting the head-rests of upholstered chairs).

Although the Dutch controlled the coast, it was not until the early 20th century that they gained power over the southern interior through a series of treaties with local rulers. Meanwhile, Dutch missionaries converted many of the Toraja people to Christianity. By 1938, the population of Makassar had reached around 84,000 – a town described by writer Joseph Conrad as &quot;the prettiest and perhaps, cleanest looking of all the towns in the islands&quot;.

During World War II, the Makassar area was defended by approximately 1000 men of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army commanded by Colonel M. Vooren. He decided that he could not defend the coast, and was planning to fight a guerrilla war inland. The Japanese landed near Makassar on 9 February 1942. The defenders retreated but were soon overtaken and captured.

===After independence===
In 1945, Indonesia proclaimed its Independence, and in 1946, Makassar became the capital of the State of East Indonesia, part of the United States of Indonesia. In 1950, it was the site of fighting between pro-Federalist forces under Captain Kahar Muzakkar and Republican forces under Colonel Sunkono during the Makassar uprising.

==Geography==
Makassar is the capital of the province of South Sulawesi, located in the southern part of Sulawesi Island, formerly known as Ujung Pandang, bordered to the north by Maros Regency and Pangkajene and Islands Regency, to the east by Maros Regency, to the south by Gowa Regency, and to the west by Makassar Strait. The area of Makassar City is recorded as 175.77 square kilometers.

Makassar City is a city located near the coast that stretches along the western and northern corridors and is also known as the &quot;Waterfront City&quot; which contains several rivers such as the Tallo River, Jeneberang River, and Pampang River) all of which flow into the city. Makassar City is a stretch of lowland at an altitude of between 0-25 meters above sea level.

===Climate===
Makassar has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;). The average temperature for the year in Makassar is , with little variation due to its near-equatorial latitude: the average high is around and the average low around all year long. 

In contrast to the virtually consistent temperature, rainfall shows wide variation between months due to the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Makassar averages around of rain on 163 days during the year, but during the month with least rainfall – August – only on one day of rain can be expected. In contrast, during its wet season, Makassar can expect more than per month between December and February. During the wettest month of January, can be expected to fall on twenty-seven rainy days.
==Government==
The executive head of the city is the mayor, who is elected by direct vote for a period of five years. The mayor is assisted by a vice mayor, who is also an elected official. There is a legislative assembly for the city, members of which are also elected for a period of five years.

===Administrative divisions===
Makassar City is divided into 15 administrative districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) and subdivided into 153 urban villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;). The districts are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the number of administrative villages (all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;) in each district.

Note (a) The 2010 population of the Sangkarrang Islands District (&quot;Kecamatan Kepulauan Sangkarrang&quot;) is included in the figure for the Ujung Tanah district, from which it was cut out.

==Demographics==
Makassar is a multi-ethnic city, populated mostly by the native Makassarese and Buginese. The remainder are Torajans, Mandarese, Butonese, Chinese (predominantly from the Cantonese dialect group) and Javanese. The current population as of mid-2023 is approximately 1,474,393, with a Metropolitan total of 2,795,639.

==Economy==

The city is one of Indonesia&#x27;s primary ports, with regular international and domestic shipping connections. It is nationally famous as an essential port of call for the pinisi ships, wooden sailing ships which are among the last in use for regular long-distance trade.

During the colonial era, the city was widely known as the namesake of Makassar oil, which it exported in substantial quantity. Makassar ebony is a warm black hue, streaked with tan or brown tones, and highly prized for use in making fine cabinetry and veneers.

Nowadays, as the largest city in Sulawesi and Eastern Indonesia, the city&#x27;s economy depends highly on the service sector, which makes up approximately 70% of activity. Restaurant and hotel services are the most significant contributor (29.14%), followed by transportation and communication (14.86%), trading (14.86), and finance (10.58%). Industrial activity is the next most important after the service sector, with 21.34% of overall activity. The Makassar Industrial Estate (&quot;Kawasan Industri Makassar&quot;), located within the city&#x27;s boundaries, measures at 270.84 hectares.

===Connection with Australia===

Makassar is also a significant fishing center in Sulawesi. One of its major industries is the trepang (sea cucumber) industry. Trepang fishing brought the Makassan people into contact with Indigenous Australian peoples of northern Australia, long before European settlement (from 1788).

C. C. MacKnight in his 1976 work entitled &quot;Voyage to Marege: Macassan Trepangers in Northern Australia&quot; has shown that they began frequenting the north of Australia around 1700 in search of trepang (sea-slug, sea cucumber, Beche-de-mer), an edible Holothurian. They left their waters during the Northwest Monsoon in December or January for what is now Arnhem Land, Marriage or Marega and the Kimberley region or Kayu Djawa. They returned home with the south-east trade winds in April. 

A fleet of between 24 and 26 Macassan perahus was seen in 1803 by French explorers under Nicolas Baudin on the Holothuria Banks in the Timor Sea. In February 1803, Matthew Flinders in the &quot;Investigator&quot; met six perahus with 20–25 men each on board and was told by the fleet&#x27;s chief Pobasso, that there were 60 perahus then on the north Australian coast. They were fishing for trepang and appeared to have only a small compass as a navigation aid. In June 1818 Macassan trepang fishing was noted by Phillip Parker King in the vicinity of Port Essington in the Arafura Sea.

In 1865, R.J. Sholl, then Government Resident for the British settlement at Camden Sound (near Augustus Island in the Kimberley region) observed seven &#x27;Macassan&#x27; perahus with a total of around 300 men on board. He believed that they made kidnapping raids and ranged as far south as Roebuck Bay (later Broome) where &#x27;quite a fleet&#x27; was seen around 1866. Sholl believed that they did not venture south into other areas such as Nickol Bay (where the European pearling industry commenced around 1865) due to the absence of trepang in those waters.

The Macassan voyages appear to have ceased sometime in the late nineteenth century, and their place was taken by other sailors operating from elsewhere in the Indonesian archipelago.

A radio documentary on the trade between Makassar and North-East Arnhem Land, entitled &quot;Trepang Trade&quot;, was made by the historian and film-maker Tom Murray for ABC Radio National in 2000. This work included descriptions of the trade made by Yolngu Aboriginal people who had visited Makassar with the trading boats, including a man called Djalatjerri (variously spelt as Djalatjirri or Djaladjari) who was interviewed by the anthropologists Ronald Berndt and Catherine Berndt. Other Yolngu recollections of the trade featured in this work are by Charlie Matjuwi Burarrwanga, a Gumatj man from Elcho Island, and Mowarra Ganambarr OAM, a Dätiwuy man from Rorruwuy in NE Arnhem Land. 

==Transportation==
Makassar has a public transportation system called &quot;pete-pete&quot;. A pete-pete (known elsewhere in Indonesia as an &quot;angkot&quot;) is a share taxi that has been modified to carry passengers. The route of Makassar&#x27;s pete-petes is denoted by the letter on the windshield. Makassar is also known for its &quot;becak&quot; (pedicabs), which are smaller than the &quot;becak&quot; on the island of Java. In addition to becak and pete-pete, the city has a government-run bus system, taxis and ride-hailing services such as Gojek.

A bus rapid transit (BRT), which is known as &quot;Trans Mamminasata&quot; was started in 2014. It has some routes through Makassar and connects to nearby cities including Maros, Takallar, and Gowa. Run by the Indonesian Transportation Department, each bus can accommodate 20 standing passengers in addition to 20 seats.

A 35-kilometer monorail in the areas of Makassar, Maros Regency, Sungguminasa (Gowa Regency), and Takalar Regency (the &quot;Mamminasata&quot; region) was proposed in 2011, with operations commencing in 2014, at a predicted cost of Rp.4 trillion ($468 million). The memorandum of understanding was signed on 25 July 2011 by Makassar city, Maros Regency and Gowa Regency. In 2014, the project was officially abandoned, citing insufficient ridership and a lack of financial feasibility.

The city of Makassar, its outlying districts, and the South Sulawesi Province are served by Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport. The airport is located outside the Makassar city administration area, being situated in the nearby Maros Regency.

The city is served by &quot;Soekarno-Hatta Sea Port&quot;. In January 2012 it was announced that due to limited capacity of the current dock at Soekarno-Hatta sea port, it would be expanded to 150x30 square meters to avoid the need for at least two ships to queue every day.

== Media ==
The oldest newspaper in the Makassar region is &quot;Fajar&quot;, part of Jawa Pos Group. Several other newspapers such as &quot;Tribun Timur&quot; and &quot;Ujungpandang Ekspres&quot; are also available.

The privately owned Fajar TV are the local TV stations based in Makassar. The public TVRI South Sulawesi is also covered the city.

== Traditional cuisine ==

Makassar has several famous traditional foods, the most famous of which is &quot;coto makassar&quot;. It is a &quot;soto&quot; (stew) made from a mixture of nuts, spices, and selected offal which may include beef brain, tongue and intestine. &quot;Konro&quot;, a rib dish, is also a popular traditional food in Makassar. Both &quot;coto makassar&quot; and &quot;konro&quot; are usually consumed with &quot;burasa&quot; or &quot;ketupat&quot;, a glutinous rice cake. Another famous dish from Makassar is &quot;ayam goreng sulawesi&quot; (Celebes fried chicken); the chicken is marinated with a traditional soy sauce recipe for up to 24 hours before being fried to a golden color. The dish is usually served with chicken broth, rice and special &quot;sambal&quot; (chilli sauce).

In addition, Makassar is the home of &quot;pisang epe&quot; (pressed banana), as well as &quot;pisang ijo&quot; (green banana). &quot;Pisang epe&quot; is a banana which is pressed, grilled, and covered with palm sugar sauce and sometimes consumed with durian. Many street vendors sell &quot;pisang epe&quot;, especially around the area of Losari Beach. &quot;Pisang ijo&quot; is a banana covered with green colored flour, coconut milk, and syrup. &quot;Pisang ijo&quot; is sometimes served iced and local fasting Muslims often consume it at iftar during Ramadan.

<doc id="389469" wikidata="Q1069138" url="?curid=389469" title="Oscar Bernadotte">
<text>Prince Oscar Carl August Bernadotte, Count of Wisborg (15 November 1859 – 4 October 1953) was a Swedish religious activist, the second son of King Oscar II of Sweden and his consort, Sofia of Nassau. Born as a Prince of Sweden and Norway, he was known as Prince Oscar, Duke of Gotland. However, by marrying contrary to Swedish constitutional requirements, he lost those titles, becoming instead Luxembourgish nobility as Prince Bernadotte and Count of Wisborg.

==Career==
Prince Oscar, before his marriage, served in the Swedish Navy, where he was enlisted for 25 years and attained the rank of Vice Admiral. In his youth, he visited the United States several times, beginning in 1876, and sailed around the world from 1883 to 1885 on the &quot;Vanadis&quot;.

Bernadotte was very active in social organizations, especially religious ones, such as the YMCA of Sweden and &quot;Friends of Mission to the Laps&quot;, both of which he chaired for many years. As the only member of Swedish royalty known to be &quot;born again&quot;, he founded the Södertälje Conferences, as inspired by the Keswick Convention, in 1898 and was an engaging inter-denominational Christian lay preacher of wide repute.

==Title==

Through Oscar&#x27;s marriage in Bournemouth on 15 March 1888 to Swedish noblewoman Ebba Munck af Fulkila, lady-in-waiting to the Crown Princess, without the consent of his father, the King, he gave up his right of succession to the Swedish throne and his royal title.

Ebba was a lady-in-waiting of the crown princess, Victoria of Baden, who in 1885 visited her brother-in-law in Amsterdam, where he was to undergo a medical examination. Ebba and Oscar visited the Norwegian sailor church during their stay in Amsterdam and fell in love: Ebba was religious and influenced Oscar in this regard. When Oscar told his family that he wished to marry Ebba, they were scandalized. He was forced to take a two-year consideration period, and Ebba was dismissed as a lady-in-waiting. In 1887, Oscar told his family that he had not changed his mind, and the royal house gave its consent to the marriage on condition that Oscar&#x27;s brothers signed a document promising that they should never enter a similar marriage, which they did. On 21 January 1888, a ball was arranged at the Royal Palace of Stockholm, where Ebba and Oscar were allowed to dance with each other, and on 29 January 1888, the engagement was formally announced. The match was regarded as a great sorrow within the royal house, but it received a lot of sympathy from the public. It was said that a bridge had been placed between the people and the royal house, &quot;The Munck bridge&quot;, and the fact that Oscar had to give up his royal title made people say that the king no longer had four sons but only three, as one of them &quot;married and had to quit&quot;. When the couple left Stockholm, a large crowd had gathered at the train station to see them off and show their support.

They were married on 15 March 1888 in St Stephen&#x27;s Church at Bournemouth in England by the vicar Gustaf Beskow, who was close to the queen, Sofia of Nassau, in the presence of Oscar&#x27;s mother, Queen Sophia, two of his brothers (Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland, and Prince Eugen, Duke of Närke), his cousin the Danish crown princess Louise of Sweden, as well as the mother and brother of Ebba.

He and his wife were named with new titles as &quot;Prince and Princess Bernadotte&quot; as of their wedding day. It has never been determined if that was a Swedish title of nobility or another form of unofficial courtesy title (such as some later dynasty members have been given). On 2 April 1892, he and his wife were given personal noble titles as Prince and Princess Bernadotte when admitted into the nobility of Luxembourg by Oscar&#x27;s uncle Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, previously Duke of Nassau, and also then given a Luxembourgish hereditary title as Count and Countess of Wisborg. &quot;Wisborg&quot; was derived from Visborg, castle ruins in Oscar&#x27;s former Duchy of Gotland.

The &quot;Prince Couple&quot;, as they were called, at first lived in Karlskrona, but in 1892 moved to Stockholm and remained there. They maintained summer residences at Villa Fridhem in Gotland and Malmsjö Manor in Sudermania.

==Personal life==
His wife was the daughter of Carl Jacob Munck af Fulkila (1808–1882) and his spouse, Baroness Henrika Ulrika Antoinetta Carolina Cederström (1819–1912).

They had five children:
* Countess &quot;Maria&quot; Sophie Henrietta Bernadotte af Wisborg (1889–1974)
* Count &quot;Carl&quot; Oscar Bernadotte af Wisborg (1890–1977)
* Ebba &quot;Sofia&quot; Fleetwood (1892–1936)
* &quot;Elsa&quot; Victoria Cedergren (1893–1996)
* Count &quot;Folke&quot; Bernadotte af Wisborg (1895–1948)

He was the last surviving son of Oscar II.

<doc id="389471" wikidata="Q560505" url="?curid=389471" title="Benny Moré">
<text>Bartolomé Maximiliano Moré Gutiérrez (24 August 1919 – 19 February 1963), better known as Benny Moré (also spelled Beny Moré), was a Cuban singer, bandleader and songwriter. Due to his fluid tenor voice and his great expressivity, he was known variously as &quot;El Bárbaro del Ritmo&quot; and &quot;El Sonero Mayor&quot;. Moré was a master of the – the art of vocal improvisation in son cubano – and many of his tunes developed this way. He often took part in &quot;controversias&quot; (vocal duels) with other singers, including Cheo Marquetti and Joseíto Fernández. Apart from &quot;son cubano&quot;, Moré was a popular singer of guarachas, cha cha cha, mambo, son montuno, and boleros.

Moré started his career with the Trío Matamoros in the 1940s and after a tour in Mexico he decided to stay in the country. Both Moré and dancer Ninón Sevilla made their cinematic debut in 1946&#x27;s &quot;Carita de cielo&quot;, but Moré focused on his music career. In the late 1940s, he sang guaracha-mambos with Pérez Prado, achieving great success. Moré returned to Cuba in 1952 and worked with Bebo Valdés and Ernesto Duarte. In 1953, he formed the Banda Gigante, which became one of the leading Cuban big bands of the 1950s. He suffered from alcoholism and died of liver cirrhosis in 1963 at the age of 43.

==Early life==

The eldest of 18 children, Moré was born in the town of Santa Isabel de las Lajas in the former Santa Clara Province, current Cienfuegos Province, in central Cuba. His parents were Virginia Moré and Silvestre Gutiérrez. His maternal great-great grandfather, Ta Ramón Gundo Paredes (later changed to Ta Ramón Gundo Moré), was said to be the son of the king of a tribe in the Kingdom of Kongo who was captured by slave traders and sold to a Cuban plantation owner named Ramon Paredes and subsequently to another Cuban landowner named Conde Moré (Paredes/Moré was later liberated and died as a freeman at age 94.)

As a child, Moré learned to play the guitar, making his first instrument at the age of six, according to his mother, from &quot;a stick and a sardine can that served as the sound box&quot;. In 1936, at the age of 17, he left Las Lajas for Havana, where he made a living by selling bruised and damaged fruits and vegetables and medicinal herbs. Six months later, he returned to Las Lajas and went to cut cane for a season with his brother Teodoro. With the money he earned and Teodoro&#x27;s savings, Moré bought his first guitar in Morón, Cuba.

==Career==
In 1940, Moré returned to Havana. He lived from hand-to-mouth, playing in bars and cafés, passing the hat. His first breakthrough was winning a radio competition. In the early 1940s, radio station CMQ had a program called &quot;The Supreme Court of Art&quot;, in which a wide variety of artists participated. Winners were given contracts by unscrupulous businessmen, who exploited them. The less fortunate were treated to the humiliation of a loud church bell that brutally terminated their performances.

In his first appearance, Moré had scarcely begun to sing when the bell sounded, and he was booed off the stage. He later competed again and won first prize. He then landed his first stable job with the Conjunto Cauto led by Mozo Borgellá. He also sang with success on the radio station CMZ with Lázaro Cordero&#x27;s Sexteto Fígaro. In 1941, Moré made his debut on Radio Mil Diez, performing with the Conjunto Cauto, directed by Mozo Borgella.

===Conjunto Matamoros and Mexico===
Ciro Rodríguez, of the famed Trío Matamoros, heard Moré singing in the bar El Temple and was greatly impressed. In 1942, Conjunto Matamoros was engaged for a live performance for Radio Mil Diez. However, Miguel Matamoros was indisposed and asked Mozo Borgellá to lend him a singer. Borgellá sent Moré, who worked for several years with Conjunto Matamoros, making a number of recordings.

Moré replaced Miguel Matamoros as lead singer, and the latter dedicated himself to leading the band. On 21 June 1945, Moré went with Conjunto Matamoros to Mexico, where he performed in two of the most famous cabarets: the Montparnasse and the Río Rosa. He made several recordings. Conjunto Matamoros returned to Havana, but Moré remained in Mexico. Rafael Cueto said to him: &quot;Fine, but just remember that they call burros &#x27;bartolo&#x27; here. Stay, but change your name.&quot; &quot;Ok,&quot; replied Moré, &quot;from now on my name is Beny, Beny Moré.&quot; Moré was left penniless and got permission to work from the performing artists&#x27; union. With this, he was able to get a job at the Río Rosa, where he formed the Dueto Fantasma (also known as Dueto Antillano) with Lalo Montané, in December 1945.

In Mexico City, Moré made recordings for RCA Victor, with Perez Prado: &quot;Anabacoa&quot;, &quot;Bonito y Sabroso&quot;, &quot;Mucho Corazón&quot;, &quot;Pachito Eché&quot;, &quot;La Múcura&quot;, &quot;Rabo y Oreja&quot; and other numbers. He recorded &quot;Dolor Karabalí&quot;, which Moré considered his best composition recorded with Pérez Prado, one he never wanted to re-record, also his recording in Mexico with Rafael de Paz Orchestra of &quot;Bonito y Sabroso&quot; was never recorded again by Moré, even though his famous composition of the months prior to leaving Mexico became in time the theme of his big band in Cuba. Moré was always reluctant to record newer versions of his hit songs, as he thought &quot;you don&#x27;t fix what&#x27;s not broken&quot;. Moré and Prado recorded 28 songs in total, mostly mambos.

Moré also recorded with the orchestra of Mariano Mercerón: &quot;Me Voy Pa&#x27;l Pueblo&quot;, &quot;Desdichado&quot;, &quot;Mucho Corazon&quot;, &quot;Ensalada de Mambo&quot;, &quot;Rumberos de Ayer&quot; and &quot;Encantado de la Vida&quot; with &quot;El Conjunto de Lalo Montane&quot;, a Colombian singer and composer, with which he recorded in Mexico, conforming a famous duo called &quot;The Phantom Duet&quot; or &quot;Dueto Fantasma&quot;. He also recorded with Mexican orchestras, specially with the one directed by Rafael de Paz; they recorded &quot;Yiri Yiri Bon&quot;, &quot;La Culebra&quot;, &quot;Mata Siguaraya&quot;, &quot;Solamente Una Vez&quot; and &quot;Bonito y Sabroso&quot;, a mambo song where he praises the dancing skills of the Mexicans and claims that Mexico City and La Habana are sister cities. In this time Benny also recorded with the orchestra of Jesús &quot;Chucho&quot; Rodríguez. El &quot;Chucho&quot; was so impressed with Benny&#x27;s musical ability that he referred to him as &quot;El Bárbaro del Ritmo&quot;. 

Moré and other performers such as Amalia Aguilar appeared as themselves in the Ernesto Cortázar-directed 1949 film &quot;En cada puerto un amor&quot;, a film in the musical comedy and drama genres.

===Return to Cuba===

During the spring of 1952, around April, Moré returned to Cuba. He was a star in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Colombia, Brazil and Puerto Rico, but virtually unknown on the island. His first Cuban recordings were with Mariano Mercerón &amp; his Orchestra, including songs such as &quot;Fiesta de Tambores&quot;, &quot;Salomón&quot;, &quot;La Chola&quot;, among others. Moré began alternating between performances in the Cadena Oriental radio station and trips to Havana to record at the RCA studios in CMQ Radiocentro.

In Havana, Moré worked for the radio station RHC-Cadena Azul, with the orchestra of Bebo Valdés, who introduced the new style called &quot;batanga&quot;. The presenter of the show, Ibraín Urbino, presented him as &quot;El Bárbaro del Ritmo.&quot; They offered him the opportunity to record with Sonora Matancera, but he declined the offer because he did not care for the sound of the group. After the batanga fell out of fashion, Moré was contracted by Radio Progreso with the orchestra of Ernesto Duarte Brito. In addition to the radio, he also performed at dances, cabarets and parties. When he sang in Havana&#x27;s Centro Gallego, people filled the sidewalks and the gardens of the Capitolio to hear him. In 1952, Moré made a recording with the Orquesta Aragón with whom he would perform in dance halls. Orquesta Aragón was from Cienfuegos and was having trouble breaking into Havana and Moré helped them in this way.

===Banda Gigante===

Also in 1952, Moré was told that Duarte Brito was not taking Moré to certain Saturday engagements because Moré was black. Moré was furious and brought the issue up to the RCA Records agent in Cuba (Maurico Conde). When nothing was done, Moré decided to form his own orchestra. The first performance of Moré&#x27;s Banda Gigante was in the CMQ radio program &quot;Cascabeles Candado&quot; on August 3, 1953. The original lineup featured Ignacio Cabrera &quot;Cabrerita&quot; (piano); Miguel Franca, Santiago Peñalver, Roberto Barreto, Celso Gómez and Virgilio Vixama (saxophones); Alfredo &quot;Chocolate&quot; Armenteros, Rigoberto &quot;Rabanito&quot; Jiménez and Domingo Corbacho (trumpets); José Miguel Gómez (trombone); Alberto Limonta (double bass); Tabaquito (congas); Clemente Piquero &quot;Chicho&quot; (bongos); Rolando Laserie (drums), and Fernando Álvarez and Enrique Benitez (vocals). The Banda was generally sixteen musicians, comparable in size with the orchestras of Xavier Cugat and Pérez Prado. Although Moré could not read music, he arranged material by singing parts to his arrangers, which included pianists Cabrerita and Peruchín, as well as trombonist Generoso Jiménez.

Between the years 1953 and 1955, the Banda Gigante became immensely popular. Their first recording session took place in November 1953, which included the hit &quot;Manzanillo&quot;. Other hits followed, including self-penned songs such as &quot;Mi saoco&quot;, &quot;Santa Isabel de las Lajas&quot;, &quot;Cienfuegos&quot; and &quot;Dolor y perdón&quot;. In 1956 and 1957, they toured Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Jamaica, Haiti, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United States, where the group played at the Academy Awards. In Havana, they played at a multitude of dance halls and cabarets such as the Tropicana Club, La Campana, El Sierra, Night and Day, Alí Bar Club, and the Hotel Habana Riviera and Hotel Tryp Habana Libre.

Moré was offered a tour of Europe, France in particular, but he rejected it because of his fear of flying; he had by that time been in three airplane accidents.

===Final years===
In the aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, many of Cuba&#x27;s top musical figures emigrated, but Moré stayed in Cuba, among, as he said, &quot;mi gente&quot; (my people).

==Death==
Moré suffered from alcoholism and died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1963 at the age of 43. His funeral was attended by tens of thousands of people.

==Awards and recognition==

Moré has been cited as the greatest singer in Cuban music history by critics and musicians. In 1999, Moré was posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016. The Benny Moré Memorial Award was named in honor of the artist and was given to artists who were influential in Latin music. On 11 June 2006, Moré was honored with a star on the Walk of Fame at Celia Cruz Park in Union City, New Jersey, a heavily Cuban-American community that has hosted musical presentations and multimedia lectures on the singer.

==Legacy==
Beny Moré appears as a character in the novel &quot;The Island of Eternal Love &quot; (Penguin Random House, 2008), by Cuban-American writer Daína Chaviano, who also concludes her novel with a chapter titled &quot;Today as Yesterday&quot;, one of the best interpretations of this singer. Moré is also remembered in the 2006 film &quot;El Benny&quot;, which is based on parts of his life, and includes new versions of his songs performed by musicians including Chucho Valdés, Juan Formell and Orishas.

Numerous tribute albums consisting of cover versions of Moré&#x27;s songs have been released by artists such as Tito Puente (1978, 1979 and 1985), Charanga de la 4 (1981), Bobby Carcassés (1985), Tropicana All-Stars (2004) and Jon Secada (2017).

<text>Apries () is the name by which Herodotus (ii. 161) and Diodorus (i. 68) designate Wahibre Haaibre, a pharaoh of Egypt (589 BC570 BC), the fourth king (counting from Psamtik I) of the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt. He was equated with the Waphres of Manetho, who correctly records that he reigned for 19 years. Apries is also called Hophra in Jeremiah 44:30 (; ).

== Biography ==
Apries inherited the throne from his father, pharaoh Psamtik II, in February 589 BC. Apries was an active builder who constructed &quot;additions to the temples at Athribis (Tell Atrib), Bahariya Oasis, Memphis and Sais.&quot; In Year 4 of his reign, Apries&#x27; sister Ankhnesneferibre was adopted as the new God&#x27;s Wife of Amun at Thebes. However, Apries&#x27; reign was also fraught with internal problems. In 588 BC, Apries dispatched a force to Jerusalem to protect it from Babylonian forces sent by Nebuchadnezzar II (Jer. 37:5; 34:21). His forces quickly withdrew, however, apparently avoiding a major confrontation with the Babylonians. Jerusalem, following an 18-month-long siege, was destroyed by the Babylonians in either 587 BC or 586 BC. Apries&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to intervene in the politics of the Kingdom of Judah was followed by a mutiny of soldiers from the strategically important Aswan garrison.

According to classical historians, Apries campaigned in the Levant, took Sidon and so terrified the other cities of Phoenicia that he secured their submission. However, this supposed submission was likely short lived. A recently uncovered stela from Tahpanhes records that Nebuchadnezzar II attempted to invade Egypt in 582 BC, but Apries&#x27; forces were capable to repel the invasion.

In Cyrenaica to the west, Battus II of Cyrene had encouraged further Greek settlement in his city, especially from the Peloponnese and Crete. This sparked conflict with the indigenous Libyans, whose king Adicran appealed to Apries for help around 570 BC. Apries launched a military expedition against Cyrene, but was decisively defeated at the Battle of Irasa. 

When the defeated army returned home, a civil war broke out in the Egyptian army between the indigenous troops and the foreign mercenaries. The Egyptians threw their support to Amasis II, a general who had led Egyptian forces in a highly successful invasion of Nubia in 592 BC under Pharaoh Psamtik II, Apries&#x27; father. Amasis quickly declared himself pharaoh in 570 BC, and Apries fled Egypt and sought refuge in a foreign country. When Apries marched back to Egypt in 567 BC with the aid of a Babylonian army to reclaim the throne of Egypt, he was likely killed in battle with Amasis&#x27; forces. Alternatively, Herodotus (Histories 2.169) holds that Apries survived the battle, and was captured and treated well by the victorious Amasis, until the Egyptian people demanded justice against him, whereby he was placed into their hands and strangled to death. Amasis thus secured his kingship over Egypt and was then its unchallenged ruler.

Amasis, however, reportedly treated Apries&#x27; mortal remains with respect and observed the proper funerary rituals by having Apries&#x27; body carried to Sais and buried there with &quot;full military honours.&quot; Amasis, the former general who had declared himself pharaoh, also married Apries&#x27; daughter, Khedebneithirbinet II, to legitimise his accession to power. While Herodotus claimed that the wife of Apries was called Nitetis (Νιτῆτις) (in Greek), &quot;there are no contemporary references naming her&quot; in Egyptian records. 

Eusebius placed the eclipse of Thales in 585 BC, in the eighth or twelfth year of Apries&#x27; reign.

==Monuments==
An obelisk which Apries erected at Sais was moved by the 3rd century AD Roman Emperor Diocletian and originally placed at the Temple of Isis in Rome. It is today located in front of the Santa Maria sopra Minerva basilica church in Rome.

<text>A Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) is an undergraduate degree in business administration awarded by colleges and universities after completion of four years and typically 120 credits of undergraduate study in the fundamentals of business administration.

==Curriculum structure==
The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional aspects of a company and their interconnection, while also allowing specialization in a particular business-related academic discipline. BBA programs expose students to a range of core subjects and generally allow students to specialize in a specific business-related academic discipline or disciplines.

The BBA degree also develops a student&#x27;s practical, managerial, and communication skills, and business decision-making capabilities that prepare them for the management of a business entity. Many programs incorporate training and practical experience in the form of case projects, presentations, internships, industrial visits, and interaction with established industry experts. 

General educational requirements emphasize humanities and social sciences, including history, economics, and literature. Core mathematics curriculum are usually required and business-related, including quantitative mathematics accounting, statistics, and related courses. Calculus and business statistics are usually required.

===BSBA===
The Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) is a quantitative variant of the BBA. General educational requirements are even more mathematics-oriented; furthermore, the general focus within business may also be more analytic, often allowing additional quantitative optional coursework.

==Accreditation==
Particularly in the United States, undergraduate business administration programs are almost always accredited, which represents that the college or university&#x27;s BBA program meets curriculum quality standards.

==Rankings==
Most business schools operate as schools of business within universities and colleges. In its 2024 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the following undergraduate business administration programs as the ten best globally:

*1: Harvard University (Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.)
*2: Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.)
*3: University of Chicago (Chicago, Illinois, U.S.)
*4: Stanford University (Stanford, California, U.S.)
*5: University of California, Berkeley (Berkeley, California, U.S.)
*6: Columbia University (New York City, U.S.)
*7: University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.)
*8: London School of Economics (London, UK)
*9: Monash University (Clayton, Victoria, Australia)
*10: Erasmus University Rotterdam (Rotterdam, Netherlands)

<doc id="389489" wikidata="Q1280017" url="?curid=389489" title="Ebony (magazine)">
<text>Ebony is a monthly magazine that focuses on news, culture, and entertainment. Its target audience is the African-American community, and its coverage includes the lifestyles and accomplishments of influential black people, fashion, beauty, and politics.

&quot;Ebony&quot; magazine was founded in Chicago in 1945 by John H. Johnson, for his Johnson Publishing Company. He sought to address African-American issues, personalities and interests in a positive and self-affirming manner. Its cover photography typically showcases African-American public figures, including entertainers and politicians, such as Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, former U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama, Beyoncé, Tyrese Gibson, and Tyler Perry. Each year, &quot;Ebony&quot; selects the &quot;100 Most Influential Blacks in America&quot;.

After 71 years, in June 2016, Johnson Publishing sold both &quot;Ebony&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot;, another Johnson publication, to a private equity firm called Clear View Group. The new publisher is known as Ebony Media Corporation. After the publication went bankrupt in July 2020, it was purchased for $14 million by Junior Bridgeman in December 2020.

==History==
===1945–1969===
&quot;Ebony&quot; was founded by John H. Johnson in 1945. The magazine was named by Johnson&#x27;s wife, Eunice Walker Johnson, thinking of the dark wood. The magazine was patterned after the format of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. &quot;Ebony&quot; published its first issue on November 1, 1945, with an initial press run of 25,000 copies that sold out completely. &quot;Ebony&quot;&#x27;s earlier content focused on African-American sports and entertainment figures, but eventually began including black achievers and celebrities of many different professions.

Editors stated in the first issue: We like to look at the zesty side of life. Sure, you can get all hot and bothered about the race question (and don&#x27;t think we don&#x27;t), but not enough is said about all the swell things we Negroes can do and will accomplish. Ebony will try to mirror the happier side of Negro life – the positive, everyday achievements from Harlem to Hollywood. But when we talk about race as the No. 1 problem of America, we&#x27;ll talk turkey.

During the 1960s, the magazine increasingly covered the civil rights movement. Articles were published about political events happening all over the U.S. where activists protested racial violence and advocated for increasing social mobility for African Americans across the diaspora. Also published was content about the Black Power movement. In 1965, executive editor Lerone Bennett Jr. wrote a recurring column entitled &quot;Black Power&quot;, which featured an in-depth profile of Stokely Carmichael in 1966. &quot;Ebony&quot; also commemorated historical events that contributed to black citizenship and freedom such as the September 1963 issue that honored the 100th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.

===1969–1985===
&quot;Ebony&quot;&#x27;s design and content began to shift in the late–1960s and early–1970s. A new level of competition for subscribers and readers began during the 1970s. Due to the emergence of new African-American oriented magazines such as &quot;Essence,&quot; &quot;Ebony&quot; began to cover more political activism and achievements in the 1970s. The magazine&#x27;s February 1971 cover featured 13 black congressmen and women. &quot;Ebony&quot; highlighted the black professionals serving in Jimmy Carter&#x27;s administration in the March 1977 issue.

===1985–2005===
The magazine reached unprecedented levels of popularity, with marketers estimating that &quot;Ebony&quot; reached over 40% of the African-American adults in the United States during the 1980s, a feat unmatched by any other general–interest magazine at the time. Beginning in the mid-1970s, advertisers created customized ads for the magazine which featured African-American models using their products. In 1985, &quot;Ebony Man&quot;, a monthly men&#x27;s magazine was created, printing the first issue in September 1985. By &quot;Ebony&quot;&#x27;s 40th anniversary in November 1985, it had a circulation of 1.7 million.

===2005–present===
In December 2008, Google announced that it was scanning back issues for Google Book Search. As of that date, all issues from November 1959 to December 2008 were made available for free. 

In 2010, the Johnson Publishing Company sold its historic building at 820 S. Michigan Avenue in Chicago&#x27;s South Loop to Columbia College Chicago. The same year, &quot;Ebony&quot; was redesigned to update its longtime brand. In the past, the magazine was persistently upbeat, much like its postwar contemporary &quot;Life&quot; magazine. However, in the 21st century, &quot;Ebony&quot; featured more controversial content.

The November 2011 cover featured a pregnant Nia Long, reminiscent of the iconic image of actress Demi Moore portrayed naked while pregnant on a major magazine cover two decades before. Some of &quot;Ebony&quot;′s more conservative readers objected to the cover, stating it was inappropriate to feature an unwed, pregnant woman on the cover. The cover made national headlines in &quot;US Weekly&quot; and in a five-minute segment on CNN. More recent issues questioned whether President Obama was still right for black America and whether biracial Americans need more acknowledgment in today&#x27;s society.

In May 2016, Johnson Publishing, the family business that founded &quot;Ebony&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot;, sold both publications to Texas-based private equity firm CVG Group for an undisclosed price. Under CVG&#x27;s ownership, &quot;Ebony&quot; struggled to find its footing, culminating in its 2017 move to lay off a third of its staff and move editorial operations to Los Angeles. 

In 2018, &quot;Ebony&quot;&#x27;s publishing schedule was changed from being published monthly to a double issue published once each month. 

On May 24, 2019, CVG suspended the print edition of the magazine, with the Spring 2019 issue the last to be printed. Johnson Publishing filed for bankruptcy protections that same year.

In December 2020, Milwaukee Bucks alum and Black businessman Junior Bridgeman bought &quot;Ebony&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot; for $14 million from CVG. Under Bridgeman, the publication stated its intention to pivot toward themes of financial literacy and building Black wealth.

In March 2021, the magazine relaunched in a digital format. 

In June 2024, it returned to Chicago for its Juneteenth celebration at Soho House.

== Notable coverage ==
=== 100 Most Influential Blacks ===
One of the most famous aspects of the magazine was its list of &quot;100 Most Influential Blacks&quot;. This list—which began in 1963, took a hiatus until 1971, and has continued on ever since—lists those who have made the greatest impact in the African-American community during the year. Most of those listed were well-educated, with 55 percent having completed a graduate degree. However, some researchers have noted that black scholars, teachers, and higher-education administrators are rarely, if ever, included on the list. The list exclusively focuses on entertainment figures, politicians, philanthropists, and entrepreneurs.

The May 2001 &quot;100+ Most Influential Black Americans&quot; issue did not include a number of influential African Americans such as Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, Armstrong Williams, Walter Williams and, most notably, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. &quot;The Economist&quot; described the exclusion of Justice Thomas from the list as spiteful.

=== Coolest Black Family in America ===
In 2018, the magazine published a series highlighting Black families from across the United States with the intention of showcasing Black family dynamics.

=== 25 Coolest Brothers of All Time ===
In August 2008, the magazine had published a special eight-cover edition featuring the &quot;25 Coolest Brothers of All Time&quot;. The lineup featured popular figures like Jay-Z, Barack Obama, Prince, Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, Marvin Gaye, Muhammad Ali and Billy Dee Williams.

=== 65th anniversary edition ===
In November 2010, the magazine featured a special 65th-anniversary edition cover featuring Taraji P. Henson, Samuel L. Jackson, Usher and Mary J. Blige. The issue included eight cover recreations from historic and iconic previous covers of &quot;Ebony&quot;. Blair Underwood posed inside, as did Omar Epps and Jurnee Smollett. National Public Radio marked this anniversary edition as the beginning of redesign of &quot;Ebony&quot;. Former White House social secretary Desiree Rogers, of the Obama administration, had become the chief executive officer of the magazine.

==Ownership==
In 2016, Johnson Publishing Company sold the magazine along with &quot;Jet&quot; to private equity firm Clear View Group. In May 2017, the editorial staff for the magazine moved from Chicago to Los Angeles along with the editorial staff for &quot;Jet&quot; magazine. In December 2020, the magazine and its sister publication &quot;Jet&quot; were purchased for $14 million by Junior Bridgeman.

==Ensuing financial difficulties==
In July 2019, three months after Johnson Publishing Company filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy liquidation, it sold its historic photo archives including the prints and negatives to a consortium of foundations to be made available to the public. After suspending the print edition of the magazine in May 2019, Clear View Group and Ebony Media Operations laid off the majority of the editing staff in June 2019.

===Lawsuits===
In 2017, 50 freelance writers created a social media campaign #EbonyOwes due to not being paid by the magazines&#x27; current owner, Clear View Group. In response to the campaign, Clear View Group made an effort to pay 11 of the 50 writers $18,000, ending with only three being paid in full. In late 2017, the remaining writers with the help of The National Writers Union filed suit against Clear View Group and Ebony Media Operations.

The remaining writers settled their lawsuit with the company in February 2018. The magazine owners were ordered to pay $80,000 Ebony Media Operations, Clear View Group and the National Writers Union agreed that all unpaid invoices would be paid over four quarterly installments by the end of 2018. In October 2018, the magazines&#x27; owner missed its third quarter payment and another lawsuit was filed in November 2018. Clear View Group made the final payment to the writers in December 2018.

<text>Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel (Oceanites oceanicus), also known as Wilson&#x27;s petrel, is a small seabird of the austral storm petrel family Oceanitidae. It is one of the most abundant bird species in the world and has a circumpolar distribution mainly in the seas of the southern hemisphere but extending northwards during the summer of the northern hemisphere. The world population was estimated in 2022 as stable at 8 to 20 million birds. In 2010 it had been estimated at 12–30 million. A 1998 book had estimated more than 50 million pairs. The name commemorates the Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson. The genus name &quot;Oceanites&quot; refers to the mythical Oceanids, the three thousand daughters of Tethys. The species name is from Latin &quot;oceanus&quot;, &quot;ocean&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Originally described in the genus &quot;Procellaria&quot; it has been placed under the genus &quot;Oceanites&quot;. Two or three subspecies are recognized and one population &quot;maorianus&quot; from New Zealand may be extinct. The nominate population breeds from Cape Horn to the Kerguelen Islands while &quot;exasperatus&quot; breeds along the Antarctic coast in the South Shetland and other islands. The population from Tierra del Fuego was described as &quot;chilensis&quot; (=&quot;wollastoni&quot;, &quot;magellanicus&quot;) but this is considered a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; although some authors have reinstated it, noting that it can be distinguished by white mottling on the belly.

The name &quot;Mother Carey&#x27;s chicken&quot; was used in early literature and often applied to several petrel species while the generic name of stormy petrel referred to the idea that their appearance foretold stormy weather. F. M. Littler and others called it the yellow-webbed storm-petrel.

==Description==

Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel is a small bird, in length with a wingspan. It is slightly larger than the European storm petrel and is essentially dark brown in all plumages, except for the white rump and flanks. The feet extend just beyond the square ended tail in flight. The European storm petrel has a very distinct whitish lining to the underwing and a nearly all dark upperwing. Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel has a diffuse pale band along the upper wing coverts and lacks the distinctive white underwing lining. The webbing between the toes is yellow with black spots in pre-breeding age individuals.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species breeds on the Antarctic coastlines and nearby islands such as the South Shetland Islands during the summer of the southern hemisphere. It spends the rest of the year at sea, and moves into the northern oceans in the southern hemisphere&#x27;s winter. It is much more common in the north Atlantic than the Pacific. Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel is common off eastern North America in the northern summer and the seasonal abundance of this bird in suitable European waters has been revealed through pelagic boat trips, most notably in the area of the Isles of Scilly and Great Britain.
It is strictly pelagic outside the breeding season, and this, together with its remote breeding sites, makes Wilson&#x27;s petrel a difficult bird to see from land. Only in severe storms might this species be pushed into headlands.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel has a more direct gliding flight than other small petrels, and like most others it flies low over the seas surface and has the habit of pattering on the water surface as it picks planktonic food items from the ocean surface. Their unique fluttering and hovering flight is achieved often with their wings held high. Even in calm weather, they can make use of the slight breeze produced by the waves and in effect soar while using their feet to stabilize themselves. Like the European storm petrel, it is highly gregarious, and will also follow ships and fishing boats. A soft peeping noise is often heard while the birds are feeding. They feed predominantly on planktonic invertebrates close to the surface, rarely plunging below the surface to capture prey. They may however sometimes take 3–8 cm long fish in the family Myctophidae.

At 40 g on average, it is the smallest warm-blooded animal that breeds in the Antarctic region. It nests in colonies close to the sea in rock crevices or small burrows in soft earth and lays a single white egg. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle to the burrow. In the Antarctic, nests may sometimes get snowed over leading to destruction of the nest or chicks. This storm petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by larger gulls and skuas, and will even avoid coming to land on clear moonlit nights. Both parents tend the nest and feed the single chick. The chicks call and beg for food, more vigorously when hungry. Chicks remain at nest for about 60 days and are fed on krill, fish and amphipods. Adults have the ability to identify their nest burrows in the dark and their mates by olfactory cues.

Population estimates in Antarctica evaluate the species to have about between 105 and 106 pairs. Widespread throughout its large range, Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

<doc id="389496" wikidata="Q313063" url="?curid=389496" title="Brendan Behan">
<text>Brendan Francis Aidan Behan (christened Francis Behan) ( ; ; 9 February 1923 – 20 March 1964) was an Irish poet, short story writer, novelist, playwright, and Irish Republican, an activist who wrote in both English and Irish. His widely acknowledged alcohol dependence, despite attempts to treat it, impacted his creative capacities and contributed to health and social problems which curtailed his artistic output and finally his life. 

An Irish Republican and a volunteer in the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Behan was born in Dublin into a staunchly republican family, becoming a member of the IRA&#x27;s youth organization Fianna Éireann at the age of fourteen. There was also a strong emphasis on Irish history and culture in his home, which meant he was steeped in literature and patriotic ballads from an early age. At the age of 16, Behan joined the IRA, which led to his serving time in a borstal youth prison in the United Kingdom and imprisonment in Ireland. During this time, he took it upon himself to study and became a fluent speaker of the Irish language. Subsequently released from prison as part of a general amnesty given by the Fianna Fáil government in 1946, Behan moved between homes in Dublin, Kerry and Connemara and also resided in Paris for a time.

In 1954, Behan&#x27;s first play, &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot;, was produced in Dublin. It was well received; however, it was the 1956 production at Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop in Stratford, London, that gained Behan a wider reputation. This was helped by a famous drunken interview on BBC television with Malcolm Muggeridge. In 1958, Behan&#x27;s play in the Irish language, &quot;An Giall&quot; had its debut at Dublin&#x27;s Damer Theatre. Later, &quot;The Hostage&quot;, Behan&#x27;s English-language adaptation of &quot;An Giall&quot;, met with great success internationally. Behan&#x27;s autobiographical novel, &quot;Borstal Boy&quot;, was published the same year and became a worldwide best-seller.

By the early 1960s, Behan reached the peak of his fame. He spent increasing amounts of time in New York City, famously declaring, &quot;To America, my new found land: The man that hates you hates the human race.&quot; By this point, Behan began spending time with various prominent people such as Harpo Marx and Arthur Miller and was followed by a young Bob Dylan. However, this newfound fame did nothing to aid his health or his work, with his alcohol dependence and diabetic conditions continuing to deteriorate. &quot;Brendan Behan&#x27;s New York&quot; and &quot;Confessions of an Irish Rebel&quot; received little praise. He briefly attempted to combat this by a dry stretch while staying at the Chelsea Hotel in New York, and in 1961 was admitted to Sunnyside Private Hospital, an institution for the treatment of alcohol dependence in Toronto, but he once again turned back to alcohol and relapsed back into active alcohol use.

==Early life==

Behan was born in the inner city of Dublin at Holles Street Hospital on 9 February 1923 into an educated working-class family.

His mother, Kathleen Behan, née Kearney, had two sons, Sean Furlong and Rory (Roger Casement Furlong), from her first marriage to compositor Jack Furlong; after Brendan was born she had three more sons and a daughter: Seamus, Brian, Dominic and Carmel.

They first lived in a house on Russell Street near Mountjoy Square owned by his grandmother, Christine English, who owned a number of properties in the area. Brendan&#x27;s father Stephen Behan, a house painter who had fought in the War of Independence, read classic literature to the children at bedtime including the works of Zola, Galsworthy, and Maupassant; their mother Kathleen took them on literary tours of the city. She remained politically active all her life and was a personal friend of the Irish leader Michael Collins. Kathleen published her autobiography, &quot;Mother of All The Behans&quot;, a collaboration with her son Brian, in 1984.

Brendan Behan wrote a lament to Collins, &quot;The Laughing Boy&quot;, at the age of thirteen. The title was from the affectionate nickname Mrs Behan gave to Collins.

Behan&#x27;s uncle Peadar Kearney wrote The Soldier&#x27;s Song, which became the Irish national anthem &quot;Amhrán na bhFiann&quot; when translated into Irish. His brother Dominic was also a songwriter, best known for the song &quot;The Patriot Game&quot;; His brother Brian was a prominent radical political activist and public speaker, actor, author, and playwright.

Biographer Ulick O&#x27;Connor wrote that one day, aged eight, Brendan was returning home with his granny and a friend from a pub. A passer-by remarked, &quot;Oh, my! Isn&#x27;t it terrible, ma&#x27;am, to see such a beautiful child deformed?&quot; &quot;How dare you,&quot; joked his granny. &quot;He&#x27;s not deformed; he&#x27;s just drunk!&quot;

In 1937, the Behan family moved to a newly-built local council housing scheme in Kildare Road, Crumlin, then seen by Dubliners as the countryside – Stephen muttered that the working classes were being sent &quot;To Hell or to Kimmage&quot; a parody of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s demand that the Irish be sent &quot;To Hell or to Connacht&quot;. At this stage, Behan left school at 13 to enter an apprenticeship to follow in his father&#x27;s and both grandfathers&#x27; footsteps as a house painter.

==IRA activities==
Behan became a member of Fianna Éireann, the boy scout group of the Anti-Treaty IRA. He published his first poems and prose in the organisation&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Fianna: the Voice of Young Ireland&quot;. In 1931 he also became the youngest contributor to be published in &quot;The Irish Press&quot; with his poem &quot;Reply of Young Boy to Pro-English verses&quot;.

At 16, Behan joined the IRA and embarked on an unauthorised solo mission to England to set off a bomb at Cammell Laird shipyard. He was arrested while in possession of explosives. British prosecutors tried to persuade him to testify against his IRA superiors and offered in return to relocate him under a new name to Canada or another distant part of the British Commonwealth.

Refusing to be turned, the 16-year-old Behan was sentenced to three years in a borstal (Hollesley Bay, once under the care of Cyril Joyce) and did not return to Ireland until 1941. He wrote about the experience in the memoir &quot;Borstal Boy&quot;.

In 1942, during the wartime state of emergency declared by Irish Taoiseach Éamon de Valera, Behan was arrested by the Garda Síochána following a protest of the execution of IRA man George Plant Later that same year Behan was arrested at another commemoration - which the IRA had planned to take place during a Dublin commemoration ceremony for Theobald Wolfe Tone. When the group of IRA men were confronted by the police one member pointed his revolver at them but did not fire. Behan urged him to &quot;use it use it&quot;, when no shot was fired Behan shouted: &quot;Give it to me and I will shoot the bastards&quot;. When Behan received the gun he fired two shots at police and escaped the scene but was later arrested (10 April 1942). ” He was put on trial for conspiracy to murder and the attempted murder of two Garda detectives, Behan was found guilty and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.

He was first incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison in Dublin where he sketched out his play The Quare Fellow, based on a fellow prisoner. In June 1944 Behan was interned both with other IRA men and with Allied and German airmen at the Curragh Camp in County Kildare. He later related his experiences there in his memoir &quot;Confessions of an Irish Rebel&quot;. Released under a general amnesty for IRA prisoners and internees in 1946, Behan&#x27;s active IRA career was largely over by the age of 23. Aside from a short prison sentence in 1947 for trying to break an imprisoned IRA man out of prison in Manchester, Behan effectively left the organisation but remained friends with the IRAs long term Chief of Staff Cathal Goulding.

==Writer==
Behan&#x27;s prison experiences were central to his writing career. In Mountjoy, he wrote his first play, &quot;The Landlady&quot; and also began to write short stories and other prose. It was a literary magazine called &quot;Envoy&quot; (A Review of Literature and Art), founded by John Ryan, that first published Behan&#x27;s short stories and his first poem. Some of his early work was also published in &quot;The Bell,&quot; the leading Irish literary magazine of the time. He learned Irish in prison and, after his release in 1946, he spent some time in the Gaeltacht areas of counties Galway and Kerry, where he started writing poetry in Irish.

During this period he was employed by the Commissioners of Irish Lights, where the lighthouse keeper of Saint John&#x27;s Point, County Down, recommending his dismissal, described him as “the worst specimen” he had met in 30 years of service, adding that he showed &quot;careless indifference&quot; and &quot;no respect for property&quot;.

He left Ireland and all its perceived social pressures to live in Paris in the early 1950s. There, he felt he could lose himself and release the artist within. Although he still drank heavily, he managed to earn a living, supposedly by writing pornography. He returned to Dublin and began to write seriously, and to be published in serious papers such as &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, for which he wrote In 1953, drawing on his extensive knowledge of criminal activity in Dublin and Paris, he wrote a serial that was later published as &quot;The Scarperer&quot;.

Throughout the rest of his writing career, he would rise at seven in the morning and work until noon, when the pubs opened. He began to write for radio, and his play &quot;The Leaving Party&quot; was broadcast. Literary Ireland in the 1950s was a place where people drank. Behan cultivated a reputation as carouser-in-chief and swayed shoulder-to-shoulder with other literati of the day who used the pub McDaid&#x27;s as their base: Flann O&#x27;Brien, Patrick Kavanagh, Patrick Swift, Anthony Cronin, John Jordan, J. P. Donleavy and artist Desmond MacNamara whose bust of Behan is on display at the National Writers Museum. Behan fell out with the spiky Kavanagh, who reportedly would visibly shudder at the mention of Behan&#x27;s name and who referred to him as &quot;evil incarnate&quot;.

Behan&#x27;s fortunes changed in 1954, with the appearance of his play &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot;. Originally called &quot;The Twisting of Another Rope&quot; and influenced by his time spent in jail, it chronicles the vicissitudes of prison life leading up to the execution of &quot;The quare fellow&quot;, a character who is never seen. The prison dialogue is vivid and laced with satire but reveals to the reader the human detritus that surrounds capital punishment. Produced in the Pike Theatre, in Dublin, the play ran for six months. In May 1956, &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; opened in the Theatre Royal Stratford East, in a production by Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop. Subsequently, it transferred to the West End. Behan generated immense publicity for &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; as a result of a drunken appearance on the Malcolm Muggeridge TV show. The English, relatively unaccustomed to public drunkenness in authors, took him to their hearts. A fellow guest on the show, Irish-American actor Jackie Gleason, reportedly said about the incident: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t an act of God, but an act of Guinness!&quot; Behan and Gleason went on to forge a friendship. Behan loved the story of how, walking along the street in London shortly after this episode, a Cockney approached him and exclaimed that he understood every word he had said—drunk or not—but had not a clue what &quot;that bugger Muggeridge was on about!&quot; While addled, Brendan would clamber on stage and recite the play&#x27;s signature song, &quot;The Auld Triangle&quot;. The transfer of the play to Broadway provided Behan with international recognition. Rumours still abound that Littlewood contributed much of the text of &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; and led to the saying, &quot;Dylan Thomas wrote &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, Brendan Behan wrote under Littlewood&quot;. Littlewood remained a supporter, visiting him in Dublin in 1960.

In 1958, his Irish-language play &quot;An Giall&quot; (&quot;The Hostage&quot;) opened in the Damer Theatre, Dublin. Reminiscent of Frank O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;Guests of the Nation&quot;, it portrays the detention in a teeming Dublin house in the late 1950s of a British conscript soldier, seized by the IRA as a hostage pending the scheduled execution in Northern Ireland of an imprisoned IRA volunteer. The hostage falls in love with an Irish convent girl, Teresa, working as a maid in the house. Their innocent world of love is incongruous among their surroundings since the house also serves as a brothel. In the end, the hostage dies accidentally during a bungled police raid, revealing the human cost of war, a universal suffering. The subsequent English-language version &quot;The Hostage&quot; (1958), reflecting Behan&#x27;s own translation from the Irish but also much influenced by Joan Littlewood during a troubled collaboration with Behan, is a bawdy, slapstick play that adds a number of flamboyantly gay characters and bears only a limited resemblance to the original version.

His autobiographical novel &quot;Borstal Boy&quot; followed in 1958. In the vivid memoir of his time in St Andrews House, Hollesley Bay Colony Borstal, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England. (The site of St Andrews House is now a Category D men&#x27;s prison and Young Offenders Institution). An original voice in Irish literature boomed out from its pages. The language is both acerbic and delicate, the portrayal of inmates and &quot;screws&quot; cerebral. For a Republican, though, it is not a vitriolic attack on Britain; it delineates Behan&#x27;s move away from violence. In one account, an inmate strives to entice Behan into chanting political slogans with him. Behan curses and damns him in his mind, hoping that he would cease his rantings-hardly the sign of a troublesome prisoner. By the end, the idealistic boy rebel emerges as a realistic young man, who recognises the truth: violence, especially political violence, is futile. The 1950s literary critic Kenneth Tynan said: &quot;If the English hoard words like misers... Behan sends them out on a spree, ribald, flushed, and spoiling for a fight.&quot; He was now established as one of the leading Irish writers of his generation.

Behan revered the memory of Father William Doyle, a Dublin priest of the Society of Jesus, who served as military chaplain to the Royal Dublin Fusiliers as they fought in the trenches of the Western Front. Father Doyle was killed in action while running to the aid of wounded soldiers from his regiment during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Behan expressed his affection for Father Doyle&#x27;s memory in the memoir &quot;Borstal Boy&quot;. Alfred O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s 1920 biography of the fallen chaplain was one of Behan&#x27;s favourite books.

==Personal life==
In February 1955, Behan married horticultural illustrator for &quot;The Irish Times,&quot; Beatrice Ffrench Salkeld, daughter of the painter Cecil Ffrench Salkeld. A daughter, Blanaid, was born in 1963, shortly before Behan&#x27;s death. Various biographies have established that Behan was bisexual to some degree.

==Decline and death==

Behan found fame difficult. He was a long-term heavy drinker (describing himself, on one occasion, as &quot;a drinker with a writing problem&quot; and claiming &quot;I only drink on two occasions—when I&#x27;m thirsty and when I&#x27;m not&quot;) and developed diabetes in the early 1950s but this was not diagnosed until 1956. As his fame grew, so too did his alcohol addiction. This combination resulted in a series of famously drunken public appearances, on both stage and television. Behan&#x27;s favourite drink was champagne and sherry.

The public wanted the witty, iconoclastic, genial &quot;broth of a boy&quot;, and he gave that to them in abundance, once exclaiming: &quot;There&#x27;s no bad publicity except an obituary.&quot; His health suffered, with diabetic comas and seizures occurring regularly. The public who once extended their arms now closed ranks against him; publicans flung him from their premises. His books, &quot;Brendan Behan&#x27;s Island&quot;, &quot;Brendan Behan&#x27;s New York&quot; and &quot;Confessions of an Irish Rebel&quot;, published in 1962 and 1964, were dictated into a tape recorder because he was no longer able to write or type for long enough to be able to finish them.

Behan died on 20 March 1964 after collapsing at the Harbour Lights bar (now Harkin&#x27;s Harbour Bar) in Echlin Street, Dublin. He was transferred to the Meath Hospital in central Dublin, where he died, aged 41. At his funeral, he was given a full IRA guard of honour, which escorted his coffin. It was described by several newspapers as the biggest Irish funeral of all time after those of Michael Collins and Charles Stewart Parnell.

Acclaimed Irish sculptor James Power sculpted Brendan Behan&#x27;s death mask.

Following his death, his widow had a son, Paudge Behan, with Cathal Goulding, Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army and the Official IRA.

Behan had a one-night stand in 1961 with Valerie Danby-Smith, who was Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s personal assistant and later married his son, Dr Gregory Hemingway. Nine months later, Valerie gave birth to a son she named Brendan. Brendan Behan died two years later, having never met his son.

==In popular culture==

Behan is frequently mentioned in works of popular culture. His work has been a significant influence in the writings of Shane MacGowan, and he is the subject of &quot;Streams of Whiskey&quot;, a song by The Pogues. The Pogues&#x27; &quot;Thousands Are Sailing&quot; written by lead guitarist Philip Chevron, features the lyric &quot;and in Brendan Behan&#x27;s footsteps / I danced up and down the street&quot;. Behan is also referenced in Damien Dempsey&#x27;s &#x27;Jar Song&#x27;. Behan&#x27;s version of the third verse of &quot;The Internationale&quot;, from &quot;Borstal Boy&quot; was reproduced on the LP sleeve of Dexys Midnight Runners&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Searching for the Young Soul Rebels&quot;.

He was named by the US website Irish Central as one of the greatest Irish writers of all time.

Australian singer-songwriter Paul Kelly wrote &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; as a tribute to Behan, and it was covered by Weddings, Parties, Anything on their &quot;Roaring Days&quot; album. The Mighty Mighty Bosstones 2000 album &quot;Pay Attention&quot; features the song &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, which contains the lyrics &quot;Most of what he tells us no one&#x27;s verified / He swears he was there the day that Brendan Behan died&quot;.

Behan is referenced in &quot;Thinking Voyager 2 Type Things&quot;, a song from the 1990 Bob Geldof album, Vegetarians of Love, with the lyrics &quot;So rise up Brendan Behan and like a drunken Lazarus / Let&#x27;s traipse the high bronze of the evening sky like crack crazed kings&quot;.

Chicago-based band The Tossers wrote the song &quot;Breandan Ó Beacháin&quot;, released on their 2008 album &quot;On A Fine Spring Evening&quot;. Shortly after Behan&#x27;s death a student, Fred Geis, wrote the song &quot;Lament for Brendan Behan&quot; and passed it on to the Clancy Brothers, who sang it on their album &quot;Recorded Live in Ireland&quot; the same year. This song, which calls &quot;bold Brendan&quot; Ireland&#x27;s &quot;sweet angry singer&quot;, was later covered by the Australian trio The Doug Anthony All Stars, better known as a comedy band, on their album &quot;Blue&quot;. &quot;Brendan&quot; is Seamus Robinson&#x27;s song tribute to Behan. Behan&#x27;s prison song &quot;The Auld Triangle&quot; (which featured in his play &quot;The Quare Fellow&quot; —this term being prison slang for a prisoner condemned to be hanged), has become a standard and has been recorded on numerous occasions by folk musicians as well as popular bands such as The Pogues, The Dubliners, the Dropkick Murphys and The Doug Anthony All Stars. Behan is also referenced in the opening line of the Mountain Goats song &quot;Commandante&quot;, where the narrator proclaims that he will &quot;drink more whiskey than Brendan Behan&quot;.

Behan&#x27;s two poems from his work &quot;The Hostage&quot;, &quot;On the Eighteenth Day of November&quot; and &quot;The Laughing Boy&quot; were translated into Swedish and recorded by Ann Sofi Nilsson on the album &quot;När kommer dagen&quot;. The same poems were translated in 1966 to Greek and recorded by Maria Farantouri on the album &quot;Ένας όμηρος&quot; (&quot;The hostage&quot;) by Mikis Theodorakis.

Irish actor Shay Duffin wrote and performed a one-person show in which he portrayed Behan.

A pub named after Behan is located in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston, Massachusetts. A bronze sculpture of the writer sits on the banks of the Royal Canal, while a bronze of Behan&#x27;s head sits inside Searson&#x27;s bar, one of his watering holes, on Pembroke Road, Dublin..

According to J.P. Donleavy&#x27;s &quot;History of The Ginger Man&quot;, Behan was instrumental in bringing Donleavy in contact with M. Girodios of Olympia Press (Paris) to help Donleavy&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Ginger Man&quot;, be published despite its having been ostracised by the world literature community for its &quot;filth&quot; and &quot;obscenity&quot;.

In the season 4 &quot;Mad Men&quot; episode &quot;Blowing Smoke&quot;, which premiered on 10 October 2010, Midge Daniels introduces Don to her playwright husband, Perry, and says, &quot;When we met, I said he looked like Brendan Behan.&quot;

In May 2011, &quot;Brendan at the Chelsea&quot;, written by Behan&#x27;s niece Janet Behan, was the first play performed in the Naughton Studio at the new Lyric Theatre in Belfast. The production tells the story of Behan&#x27;s residence at New York&#x27;s Hotel Chelsea in 1963. It was a critical success and is being revived for a tour to Theatre Row in New York in September 2013 before returning to the Lyric in October 2013.

Morrissey&#x27;s 2014 song &quot;Mountjoy&quot; references the writer: &quot;Brendan Behan&#x27;s laughter rings / For what he had or hadn’t done / For he knew then as I know now / That for each and every one of us / We all lose / Rich or poor, / We all lose / Rich or poor, they all lose&quot;.

In 1959, on the Album Songs for Swingin&#x27; Sellers, Peter Sellers parodies Behan&#x27;s TV interviews in the sketch &#x27;In a Free State&#x27; - an interview with Mr Bedham, an Irish playwright who is &quot;slurred, angry, panting and ready to commit murder to get at a drink&quot;. According to the journalist William J. Weatherby, Behan&#x27;s wife admired Sellers&#x27; impersonation of her husband and considered Bedham&#x27;s references to &quot;the thirst&quot; the most accurate part of the sketch. The Sketch was written by Max Schreiner with music by Ron Goodwin.

<text>Peter Howard Costello (born 14 August 1957) is an Australian businessman, lawyer and former politician who served as the treasurer of Australia in government of John Howard from 1996 to 2007. He is the longest-serving treasurer in Australia&#x27;s history. Costello was a member of parliament (MP) of the Australian House of Representatives from 1990 to 2009, representing the Division of Higgins. He also served as the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party from 1994 to 2007.

On 18 September 2008, Costello was appointed as chairman of the World Bank&#x27;s new Independent Advisory Board (IAB) to provide advice on anti-corruption measures. Costello served as Chairman of Nine Entertainment from February 2016 until June 2024. Costello is Chairman of the Board of Guardians of Australian Future Fund.

==Early life==
Costello was born on 14 August 1957 in Melbourne into a middle-class family of practising Christians. He was the second of three children; his elder brother, Tim, is a prominent Baptist minister and former CEO of World Vision Australia. Costello was educated at Carey Baptist Grammar School (graduating in 1974) and Monash University, where he studied arts and law, graduating with honours in 1982. Costello is a descendant of Irish immigrant Patrick Costello, who was expelled from the Parliament of Victoria in the 1860s for electoral fraud.

During the 1980s, Costello was a solicitor at the law firm Mallesons Stephen Jaques, then became a barrister and represented employers in some of Australia&#x27;s best-known industrial relations disputes.

In 1982 Costello married Tanya (née Coleman), daughter of writer and former Liberal politician Peter Coleman and historian Verna Coleman.

In 1983 and 1984, Costello represented the National Farmers&#x27; Federation in legal action against the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU). The AMIEU was seeking a unit tally system to be set up in abattoirs in the Northern Territory. The dispute focussed on one abattoir, Mudginberri, which chose to fight the AMIEU claim. Ultimately the AMIEU claim was unsuccessful.

Costello became counsel to organisations representing small business and rose to prominence in the 1985 Dollar Sweets case, as junior counsel assisting Alan Goldberg QC, successfully representing a confectionery company involved in a bitter industrial dispute.

==Political background==
In his student years, Costello was active in student politics. For a time, he was an office-bearer of the Social Democratic Students Association of Victoria, an affiliate of the Balaclava Branch of Australian Young Labor. In 1977, Costello was assaulted by a left-wing student politician, receiving mainstream media attention for the first time in his career as a result.

After graduating, Costello became more conservative but retained progressive views on some social issues. In 1984 he was a founding member of the H. R. Nicholls Society, a think tank on industrial relations. In the late 1980s, he was identified as part of the New Right movement, which was organised to some extent in the H. R. Nicholls Society.

==Political career==

===Early political career===
In 1990, Costello defeated sitting member Roger Shipton in a preselection ballot for the comfortably safe Liberal inner-east Melbourne electorate of Higgins, the seat once held by Harold Holt and John Gorton. He entered the House of Representatives at the age of 32. Costello made his maiden speech in May 1990 and mentioned &quot;government should be subservient to the citizen; the Executive accountable to the representative parliament; and the monopoly give way in the face of the individual.&quot; 
Following the resignation of Andrew Peacock, Costello voted for John Hewson to replace Peacock as Liberal Leader and Costello was made shadow minister for Consumer affairs and later Shadow Attorney General. However, Hewson, despite launching Peter&#x27;s local campaign in Higgins, was said to have been suspicious of Costello due to his admiration for John Howard; and is alleged to have made it clear to Costello that he would not be appointed a Minister in a Hewson government.

On one occasion Hewson accused Costello of bad mouthing him to journalist Laurie Oakes, which Costello denied.

Hewson&#x27;s shock defeat at the 1993 election, Costello believes, can be attributed to Hewson lacking the experience to know which things to try to change and which things to avoid trying to change. Costello believed Hewson fought everyone from Churches and Welfare groups over the GST to the Superannuation and Medicare organisations and recipients. Costello claimed he found it hard to promote the Liberal party&#x27;s zero Tariff policy to the car industry.

Costello developed a higher profile following the 1993 election, becoming Shadow Finance Minister (though apparently failing to become deputy Liberal Party leader). Costello came to be seen as an alternative leader to Hewson, especially through, but not limited to, the &quot;sports rorts affair&quot; where, at the urging of Costello and Hewson, Sport Minister Ros Kelly was forced to resign after it was revealed she had not handled sports&#x27; funding proposals properly. Hewson was deposed as Liberal leader in May 1994, Costello supported Alexander Downer for the leadership, becoming his Deputy Leader and shadow Treasurer. But what may well have prevented Costello from challenging Hewson for the leadership himself was an accusation by Victorian Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett that Costello and his friend, former Victorian Liberal party president Michael Kroger, had undermined Hewson&#x27;s leadership prior to Hewson calling the leadership spill.

However, when Downer in turn resigned in January 1995. Costello did not seek the leadership, instead supporting John Howard. It was later alleged—in July 2006—that this was due to a December 1994 meeting of Howard, Costello and Ian McLachlan in which Costello is said to have agreed not to challenge for the leadership in 1995 and Howard is said to have agreed to stand aside after one and a half terms as prime minister for Costello to take over. Howard denied that this was a formal arrangement.

In 2009, Hewson stated that Costello&#x27;s best chances of becoming leader were at the 1994 leadership spill or when Downer stood down 7-8 months later.

Costello became the longest serving Deputy Leader in 2006, breaking the record held by the party&#x27;s first Deputy Leader Sir Eric Harrison. He also spent all but the last two years of his political career on the front bench.

===Federal Treasurer (1996–2007)===
The Liberal/National coalition headed by Howard won the 1996 election, defeating the Keating government on a 29-seat swing, and Costello became Federal Treasurer at age 38, the same age at which Howard himself had become treasurer in 1977. He oversaw the return to and maintenance of federal budget surpluses, which enabled significant reduction in government debt. Costello brought down twelve consecutive Federal Budgets, including ten surpluses. During this period he eliminated the Commonwealth Government net debt of $96 billion. He also sold 2/3rds of the Reserve Bank&#x27;s substantial gold holdings at a record low price. Inflation, interest rates and unemployment all fell and remained generally low during Costello&#x27;s term as Treasurer.

Tax reform became a major policy focus for Costello. Although John Howard had promised during the 1996 election campaign that he would &quot;never, ever&quot; introduce a GST, it returned as Liberal Party policy for the 1998 election. It was passed through the Senate with the help of the Australian Democrats. Until July 2005, Costello&#x27;s own agenda of labour market deregulation remained blocked by the government&#x27;s lack of a Senate majority.

In 1998, Costello and his wife Tanya, along with Tony Abbott and his wife Margaret, successfully sued author Bob Ellis for false statements he made about them in his book &quot;Goodbye Jerusalem&quot;.

Costello advocated for change to a republic at the Australian Constitutional Convention 1998. He rejected any suggestion that Australia was not already an independent nation and said that the Australian Constitution works &quot;remarkably well&quot;. It was the institution of monarchy that was the crux of his argument for change:

Costello supported the 1999 referendum on whether Australia should become a republic.

After the 2001 election, he attracted criticism for not securing funding for a key election promise to extend the Medicare safety net.

In 2002, The Baby bonus scheme was reintroduced by the Federal Government of Australia in the 2002 budget was aimed at offsetting the expenses associated with bearing a child. The scheme was also introduced as a means of increasing Australia&#x27;s fertility rate and to mitigate the effects of Australia&#x27;s ageing population. Costello famously had a slogan to encourage Australians to &quot;have one for mum, one for dad and one for the country&quot;.

In February 2006, Costello caused controversy during a lecture at the Sydney Institute when questioned about the government&#x27;s refusal to legally recognise same-sex marriage. He stated, &quot;I think we do recognise the rights of gay and lesbian people in Australia. We do not criminalise [their] conduct or behaviour.&quot; He also pointed out that the law was changed in 2004 to recognise same-sex couples with regards to superannuation. He stated that marriage should only be recognised between heterosexual couples. Also during the same speech, Costello criticised &quot;mushy misguided multiculturalism,&quot; warning immigrants that the acceptance of Australian values was &quot;not optional.&quot;

===Leadership aspirations===

====Under Howard====

Costello expected to gain the Liberal leadership some time during Howard&#x27;s second term as prime minister, as per Howard&#x27;s alleged December 1994 offer. When this did not eventuate, it is alleged that Costello became frustrated, particularly when Howard announced, in July 2003, his intention to lead the government into the 2004 election.

During the 2004 election campaign, Howard avoided saying whether he would serve a full term if re-elected, saying only he would remain as long as his party supported him. The government&#x27;s subsequent success in winning control of the Senate raised speculation that Howard would further delay his retirement, with the prospect of a Costello leadership succession diminishing. And that is what happened.

In July 2006, the alleged Costello/Howard succession deal was made public by Ian McLachlan. Costello confirmed the incident had occurred and that he shared McLachlan&#x27;s interpretation of events. Howard denied the claims repeatedly, stating the continued public drama displayed &quot;hubris and arrogance&quot; and that the leadership was the party room&#x27;s to decide, not a prize to be handed over by leaders to successors.

Press Gallery columnist Michelle Grattan described Costello&#x27;s actions :
Despite tensions between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, nothing further came of those events. Neither Howard nor Costello took any action to remove the other from office, or resign. However, on 12 September 2007, amid renewed leadership tensions and a series of unfavourable public polls, Howard confirmed he would step aside well into the next term, if re-elected, and that Costello would be his &quot;logical successor&quot;.

A federal election was held on 24 November 2007. An exit poll of 2,787 voters by Auspoll, commissioned by Sky News, included a question on the statement &quot;I don’t want Peter Costello to become Prime Minister&quot;. Fifty-nine per cent agreed, while 41 per cent disagreed. The Coalition lost the election.

Given the well publicised working relationship between Howard and Costello, the two did not stay in touch after the Howard Government left office.

====In opposition (2007–2009)====
Costello was widely expected to assume the Liberal leadership after the 2007 election, but the day after the election, in a surprise announcement, he said that he would not seek or accept the leadership or deputy leadership of the Liberal Party. This was after John Howard, in his concession speech on the night of the election, specifically endorsed Costello as the next leader for the Coalition. A week later, he indicated that he would be unlikely to serve out in full his parliamentary term of three years.

However, as opposition leader Brendan Nelson struggled, speculation mounted that Costello would change his mind and seek the leadership. In August 2008, he ruled out challenging Nelson, but did not comment on the prospect of Nelson stepping aside in his favour.

Finally in September 2008, just before the release of his memoirs, &quot;The Costello Memoirs&quot;, Costello specifically re-confirmed that he would not be seeking leadership of the party and would leave politics at a time that suited him. Media attention immediately shifted to whether Costello&#x27;s decision cleared the way for a leadership challenge by Malcolm Turnbull (who was the shadow treasurer at the time). Tony Abbott described the decision as a great loss to Australia and to Costello himself, who might continue to have regrets for the rest of his life at what might have been. Media outlets capitalised on Costello&#x27;s failure to categorically rule out any future leadership challenge. An incumbent-announced leadership spill on the morning of Costello&#x27;s book release saw Turnbull defeat Nelson. Costello remained as an opposition backbencher. On 18 September 2008, Costello was appointed to the World Bank&#x27;s new Independent Advisory Board, (IAB), which will provide advice on anti-corruption measures.

On 15 June 2009, Costello announced that he would retire from Parliament at the next Federal election. However on 7 October 2009, Costello announced he would be resigning from Parliament when it resumed later in the month. He resigned on 19 October 2009, triggering the 2009 Higgins by-election. Costello&#x27;s departure came just prior to the ETS crisis that lead to Malcolm Turnbull losing the Liberal party leadership to Tony Abbott.

==Post-political career==

Costello was a member of the Board of Guardians of the Australian Government Future Fund from December 2009 until February 2024. Amidst some controversy it was announced that David Gonski would succeed the inaugural Chairman, David Murray when Murray&#x27;s term expired on 3 April 2012. Gonski&#x27;s appointment was in spite of an independent review (that was conducted by Gonski). Gonski reported to the Australian Government that the existing Guardians favoured Costello to succeed Murray as Chairman.

Costello is a managing partner of BKK Partners, a boutique corporate advisory run by former Goldman Sachs JBWere managers. He also chairs the advisory board of specialist corporate advisory firm ECG Advisory Solutions.

In 2008, his best-selling memoir was published by Melbourne University Press.

Costello wrote a regular column for Fairfax newspapers until 2013.

In October 2010, Howard published a memoir, &quot;Lazarus Rising&quot;, that drew the ire of Costello and others. Howard used the memoir to settle some personal scores, calling Costello &quot;an elitist, who&#x27;s unable to connect to ordinary Australians&quot; and accused Costello of bungling the leadership handover issue. Costello responded by claiming that Howard &quot;appears to be incapable of taking responsibility for the defeat of the government and for losing his seat of Bennelong.&quot;

In May 2012, Michael Kroger accused Costello of being interested in returning to Federal Parliament, most likely by getting a Liberal MP to step aside, with the hope of becoming leader of the Liberal Party. Costello denied this, saying that Kroger had approached him asking to help preserve his ex-wife Helen Kroger&#x27;s Senate position. At around the same time, Helen Kroger was demoted on the Senate Liberal ticket for Victoria. Kroger believes Costello was targeting her along with others; Kroger also claimed Costello very often criticises past and present Liberal party MPs and officials.

In February 2016, Costello was appointed chairman of Nine Entertainment. He resigned from Nine in June 2024 after allegedly assaulting a reporter at Canberra Airport. Costello denied the assault occurred.

==Honours==
On 26 January 2011, Peter Costello was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for &quot;eminent service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly through the development of landmark economic policy reforms in the areas of taxation, foreign investment, superannuation and corporate regulation, and through representative roles with global financial organisations&quot;.

<text>Joseph ben Caiaphas (; c. 14 BC – c. 46 AD) was the High Priest of Israel during the first century. In the New Testament, the Gospels of Matthew, Luke and John indicate he was an organizer of the plot to kill Jesus. He is portrayed as presiding over the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus. The primary sources for Caiaphas&#x27; life are the New Testament, and the writings of Josephus. The latter records he was made high priest by the Roman procurator Valerius Gratus after Simon ben Camithus had been deposed.

==Etymology==
The Babylonian Talmud (Yevamot 15B) gives the family name as Kuppai, while the Jerusalem Talmud (Yevamot 1:6) mentions &quot;Nekifi&quot;. The &quot;Mishnah&quot;, Parah 3:5, refers to the family name as hakKof (perhaps &quot;the Monkey&quot;, a play on his name for opposing the Pharisees).

The family name &quot;Caiaphas&quot; קַיָּפָה has a few possible origins:
* from קוּפָּה &#x27;basket&#x27;, &#x27;tub&#x27;, verbalized as קִיֵּף , whence קַיָּף meaning &#x27;basket maker&#x27;, or a worker utilizing baskets such as to sell spices
* κεφάλαιος: from κεφαλή (kephalḗ, “head”) + -ιος (-ios, adjective suffix) - meaning: main, chief, principal, primary
* &quot;as comely&quot; in Aramaic
* a &quot;dell&quot;, or a &quot;depression&quot; in Akkadian.

==Accounts==

===New Testament===
====John: relations with Romans====
Annas, father-in-law of Caiaphas (John 18:13), had been high-priest from AD 6 to 15, and continued to exercise a significant influence over Jewish affairs. Annas and Caiaphas may have sympathized with the Sadducees, a religious movement in Judaea that found most of its members among the wealthy Jewish elite. The comparatively long eighteen-year tenure of Caiaphas suggests he had a good working relationship with the Roman authorities.

In the Gospel of John (John 11), the high priests call a gathering of the Sanhedrin in reaction to the raising of Lazarus. In the parable related in the Gospel of Luke (Luke 16:28–30), the likely reaction of the &quot;five brothers&quot; to the possibility of the return of the beggar Lazarus has given rise to the suggestion by Claude-Joseph Drioux and others that the &quot;rich man&quot; is itself an attack on Caiaphas, his father-in-law, and his five brothers-in-law.

Caiaphas considers, with &quot;the Chief Priests and Pharisees&quot;, what to do about Jesus, whose influence was spreading. They worry that if they &quot;let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation.&quot;

In the Gospel of John (John 18), Jesus is brought before Annas, whose palace was closer. Annas questioned him regarding his disciples and teaching, and then sent him on to Caiaphas. Caiaphas makes a political calculation, suggesting that it would be better for &quot;one man&quot; (Jesus) to die than for &quot;the whole nation&quot; to be destroyed. Similar ideas can be found in rabbinical discussion in Talmud and Midrash. According to John 11:51-52 it states that &quot;He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but also to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.&quot;

Afterward, Jesus is taken to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea. Pilate tells the priests to judge Jesus themselves, to which they respond they lack authority to do so. Pilate questions Jesus, after which he states, &quot;I find no basis for a charge against him.&quot; Pilate then offers the gathered crowd the choice of one prisoner to release—said to be a Passover tradition—and they choose a criminal named Barabbas instead of Jesus.

====Matthew: trial of Jesus====
In the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 26:56–67), Caiaphas and others of the Sanhedrin are depicted interrogating Jesus. They are looking for evidence with which to convict Jesus, but are unable to find any. Jesus remains silent throughout the proceedings until Caiaphas demands that Jesus say whether he is the Christ (which means Messiah). Jesus replies &quot;The words are your own: and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.&quot; (Mark 14:62) Caiaphas and the other men charge him with blasphemy and sentence him to corporal punishment for his crime.

====Political implications====
Caiaphas was the son-in-law of Annas by marriage to his daughter and ruled longer than any high priest in New Testament times. For Jewish leaders of the time, there were serious concerns about Roman rule and an insurgent Zealot movement to eject the Romans from Israel. The Romans would not perform executions for violations of Halakha, therefore a charge of blasphemy would not have mattered to Pilate. Caiaphas&#x27; position, therefore, was to establish that Jesus was guilty not only of blasphemy, but also of proclaiming himself to be the Messiah, which was understood as the return of the Davidic kingship.

====Acts: Peter and John refuse to be silenced====
Later, in Acts 4, Peter and John went before Annas and Caiaphas after having healed a crippled beggar. Caiaphas and Annas questioned the apostles&#x27; authority to perform such a miracle. When Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, answered that Jesus of Nazareth was the source of their power, Caiaphas and the other priests realized that the two men had no formal education yet spoke eloquently about the man they called their saviour. Caiaphas sent the apostles away, and agreed with the other priests that the word of the miracle had already been spread too much to attempt to refute, and instead the priests would need to warn the apostles not to spread the name of Jesus. However, when they gave Peter and John this command, the two refused, saying &quot;Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God&#x27;s sight to obey you rather than God. For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard.&quot;

===Josephus===
The 1st-century Jewish historian Josephus is considered the most reliable extra-biblical literary source for Caiaphas. His works contain information on the dates for Caiaphas&#x27; tenure of the high priesthood, along with reports on other high priests, and also help to establish a coherent description of the responsibilities of the high-priestly office. Josephus (&quot;Antiquitates Judaicae&quot; 18.33–35) relates that Caiaphas became a high priest during a turbulent period. He also states that the Legate of Syria Lucius Vitellius the Elder deposed Caiaphas (&quot;Antiquitates Judaicae&quot; 18.95–97). Josephus&#x27; account is based on an older source, in which incumbents of the high priesthood were listed chronologically.

According to Josephus, Caiaphas was appointed in AD 18 by the Roman prefect Valerius Gratus who preceded Pontius Pilate.

According to John, Caiaphas was the son-in-law of the high priest Annas, who is widely identified with Ananus the son of Seth, mentioned by Josephus. Annas was deposed after the death of Augustus, but had five sons who served as high priest after him.
The terms of Annas, Caiaphas, and the five brothers are:

* Ananus (or Annas) the son of Seth (6–15)
:* Eleazar the son of Ananus (16–17)
:* &quot;Caiaphas&quot;, properly called Joseph son of Caiaphas (18–36/37), who had married the daughter of Annas ()
:* Jonathan the son of Ananus (spring 37)
:* Theophilus ben Ananus (37–41)
:* Matthias ben Ananus (43)
:* Ananus ben Ananus (63)

===Rabbinic literature===
According to Helen Bond, there may be some references to Caiaphas in the rabbinic literature.

==Archaeology==
In November 1990, workers found an ornate limestone ossuary while paving a road in the Peace Forest south of the Abu Tor neighborhood of Jerusalem. This ossuary appeared authentic and contained human remains. An Aramaic inscription on the side was thought to read &quot;Joseph son of Caiaphas&quot; and on the basis of this the bones of an elderly man were considered to belong to the High Priest Caiaphas. Since the original discovery, this identification has been challenged by some scholars on various grounds, including the spelling of the inscription, the lack of any mention of Caiaphas&#x27; status as High Priest, the plainness of the tomb (although the ossuary itself is as ornate as might be expected from someone of his rank and family), and other reasons.

In June 2011, archaeologists from Bar-Ilan University and Tel Aviv University announced the recovery of a stolen ossuary, plundered from a tomb in the Valley of Elah. The Israel Antiquities Authority declared it authentic, and expressed regret that it could not be studied &quot;in situ&quot;. It is inscribed with the text: &quot;Miriam, daughter of Yeshua, son of Caiaphas, Priest of Ma’aziah from Beth ‘Imri&quot;. Based on it, Caiaphas can be assigned to the priestly division of Ma’aziah, instituted by king David.

==Literature and arts==

===Literature===
In the thirteenth-century French text &quot;Estoire del Saint Graal&quot;, Caiaphas is responsible for imprisoning Joseph of Arimathea. The Roman emperor Vespasian promises not to slay or burn him for information about Joseph. To punish him, he instead sets him adrift at sea.

In &quot;Inferno&quot;, Dante Alighieri places Caiaphas in the sixth realm of the eighth circle of Hell, where hypocrites are punished in the afterlife. His punishment is to be eternally crucified across the hypocrites&#x27; path, who eternally step on him.

Caiaphas is mentioned throughout the works of William Blake as a byword for a traitor or Pharisee.

Caiaphas and his ossuary are the subjects of Bob Hostetler&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Bone Box&quot; (2008).

Caiaphas is mentioned in the 19th verse of &quot;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&quot; by Oscar Wilde:

He is also depicted having an argument with Pontius Pilate regarding the passing of the death sentence against Jesus in &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; by Mikhail Bulgakov.

===Arts===
&quot;Christ before Caiaphas,&quot; c.1490, is one of only a handful of works attributed to Antonio della Corna, who was active primarily in his native Lombardy in northern Italy.

===Film portrayals===
Actors who have portrayed Caiaphas include Rudolph Schildkraut in Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s film &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1927), Guy Rolfe in Nicholas Ray&#x27;s film &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), Rodolfo Wilcock in Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s film &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot; (1964), Martin Landau in George Stevens&#x27; film &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), Bob Bingham in Norman Jewison&#x27;s film &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973), Anthony Quinn in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s television miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977), Christian Kohlund in &quot;Jesus&quot; (1999), 
David Schofield in &quot; The Miracle Maker&quot; (2000), Mattia Sbragia in Mel Gibson&#x27;s film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), Valentin Gaft in the TV miniseries &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (2005), Bernard Hepton in &quot;Son of Man&quot;, Adrian Schiller in the TV miniseries &quot;The Bible&quot; (2013) and the film &quot;Son of God&quot; (2014), both by same production team, Rufus Sewell in &quot;Killing Jesus&quot; (2015), Richard Coyle in &quot;A.D. The Bible Continues&quot;, an NBC miniseries by Mark Burnett and Roma Downey, and Makram Khoury in &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (2024). Richard Fancy portrayed Caiaphas in Season 4 of The Chosen.

<text>The Red Hand Commando (RHC) is a small secretive Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland that is closely linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Its aim was to combat Irish republicanism – particularly the Irish Republican Army (IRA) – and to maintain Northern Ireland&#x27;s status as part of the United Kingdom. The Red Hand Commando carried out shootings and bombings, primarily targeting Catholic civilians. As well as allowing other loyalist groupings to claim attacks in their name, the organisation has also allegedly used the cover names &quot;Red Branch Knights&quot; and &quot;Loyalist Retaliation and Defence Group&quot;. It is named after the Red Hand of Ulster, and is unique among loyalist paramilitaries for its use of an Irish language motto, &quot;Lámh Dearg Abú&quot;, meaning &#x27;red hand to victory&#x27;.

Writing in early 1973, Martin Dillon characterized the Red Hand Commando thus: &quot;the composition of this group was highly selective, and it was very secret in its operations. Its membership was composed in the main of Protestant youths – the Tartans who roamed the streets at night looking for trouble. These youths longed for action, and McKeague let them have it.&quot;

The Red Hand Commando was the only major loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland not to have its ranks heavily penetrated by a so-called supergrass or informant during the early 1980s; this was attributed to the group&#x27;s secrecy (described as an &quot;enigma&quot;) and opaque structure. 

The RHC is a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000. The Red Hand Commando made a failed application in September 2017 to be removed from the list of proscribed organisations in the UK.

==History==
===Formation===
Much of the group&#x27;s past is unknown. The RHC was formed in June 1970 among loyalists in the Shankill area of west Belfast, by Ronnie &quot;Flint&quot; McCullough, William &quot;Plum&quot; Smith and colleagues from the Shankill Defence Association. Membership was high in the Shankill, east Belfast, Sandy Row and Newtownabbey areas as well as in parts of County Down. A cell was also allegedly based in County Tyrone, near Castlederg. The RHC also reportedly had a presence in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone region in the 1970s, involved in bombings and issuing threats to nationalists. The RHC agreed in 1972 to become an integral part of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). It kept its own structures but in operational matters agreed to share weapons and personnel and often carried out attacks in the name of the UVF. It was proscribed by William Whitelaw, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, on 12 November 1973. According to Jim Wilson, chairman of the Reach Programme with association of the Red Hand Commando, the RHC numbered well over one thousand members during its campaign, and as of 2017 membership numbers were in the small hundreds who are engaged in community work.

===Progressive Unionist Party formation===
A number of senior Red Hand Commando members played an integral part in the formation of the Progressive Unionist Party in 1979. The beginnings of the party were in the compounds of Long Kesh, where members such as William Smith and Winston Churchill Rea joined members of the UVF in taking a new political direction.

===Paramilitary campaign===
Following the group&#x27;s formation in 1970, RHC attacks usually took the form of random drive-by shootings targeting assumed Catholic civilians and no-warning bombs left at social spots (e.g. pubs) the group believed to be frequented by Catholics. The RHC also claimed responsibility for a number of killings in the Republic of Ireland in 1975 and 1976. During the 1980s Loyalist paramilitary violence had dropped significantly from its height in the mid-1970s, and the RHC wasn&#x27;t implicated in any killings for several years. The organisation was reportedly considered &quot;extinct&quot; by 1988, although it was also described as &quot;largely intact&quot; and capable of violence in 1984. However Loyalist paramilitary activity generally began to increase following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in 1988 the RHC was tied to at least two attempted murders. The group routinely used cover names during the first years of this resurgence in activity but later opted to claim attacks under the RHC title. RHC violence intensified in the years leading up to the 1994 Loyalist ceasefire, although never claiming as many victims as it did in the 1970s.

According to the Sutton database of deaths at the University of Ulster&#x27;s CAIN project, the RHC has allegedly killed 13 people, including 12 civilians, and one of its own members. However, as a satellite grouping of the UVF, attacks carried out by the RHC have been in some cases attributed to the UVF; per other sources the RHC has killed at least 40 people.

===Ceasefire and decommissioning===
In October 1994, the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) declared a ceasefire on behalf of all loyalist paramilitary groups. The RHC, along with all major Loyalist groups, supported the signing of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement and maintained a ceasefire from 1994 until (arguably) 2005. On 3 May 2007, the RHC declared it was officially ending its armed campaign, following recent negotiations between the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and with Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde. The RHC made a statement that it would transform to a &quot;non-military, civilianised&quot; organisation. This was to take effect from midnight. It also stated that it would retain its weaponry but put them beyond reach of normal volunteers. Its weapon stockpiles were to be retained under the watch of the RHC leadership.

===2007 official statement===
Following a direct engagement with all the units and departments of our organisation, the leadership of the Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando today make public the outcome of our three year consultation process.

We do so against a backdrop of increasing community acceptance that the mainstream republican offensive has ended; that the six principles upon which our ceasefire was predicated are maintained; that the principle of consent has been firmly established and thus, that the union remains safe.

We welcome recent developments in securing stable, durable democratic structures in Northern Ireland and accept as significant, support by the mainstream republican movement of the constitutional status quo.

Commensurate with these developments, as of 12 midnight, Thursday 3 May 2007, the Ulster Volunteer Force and Red Hand Commando will assume a non-military, civilianised, role.

To consolidate this fundamental change in outlook we have addressed the methodology of transformation from military to civilian organisation by implementing the following measures in every operational and command area.

==== Recruitment ====
All recruitment has ceased; military training has ceased; targeting has ceased and all intelligence rendered obsolete; all active service units have been de-activated; all ordinance has been put beyond reach and the IICD instructed accordingly.

We encourage our volunteers to embrace the challenges which continue to face their communities and support their continued participation in non-military capacities.

We reaffirm our opposition to all criminality and instruct our volunteers to cooperate fully with the lawful authorities in all possible instances.

Moreover, we state unequivocally, that any volunteer engaged in criminality does so in direct contravention of brigade command and thus we welcome any recourse through due process of law.

All volunteers are further encouraged to show support for credible restorative justice projects so that they, with their respective communities, may help to eradicate criminality and anti-social behaviour in our society.

We call on all violent dissidents to desist immediately.

We ask the government to facilitate this process and remove the obstacles which currently prevent our volunteers and their families from assuming full and meaningful citizenship.

We call on all violent dissidents to desist immediately and urge all relevant governments and their security apparatus to deal swiftly and efficiently with this threat.

Failure to do so will inevitably provoke another generation of loyalists toward armed resistance.

We have taken the above measures in an earnest attempt to augment the return of accountable democracy to the people of Northern Ireland and as such, to engender confidence that the constitutional question has now been firmly settled.

In doing so we reaffirm the legitimacy of our tactical response to violent nationalism yet reiterate the sincere expression of abject and true remorse to all innocent victims of the conflict.

Brigade command salutes the dedication and fortitude of officers, NCOs, and volunteers throughout the difficult, brutal years of armed resistance.

We reflect with honour on those from our organisation who made the ultimate sacrifice; those who endured long years of incarceration and the loyal families who shared their suffering and supported them throughout.

Finally, we convey our appreciation for their honest forthright exchange with officers, NCOs and volunteers throughout the organisation over the past three years which has allowed us to assume with confidence the position we adopt today.

For God and Ulster. Captain William Johnston, Adjutant.
The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) stated that this statement was &quot;unacceptable.&quot; In June 2009, after talks with the IICD, it was announced that the RHC and UVF had decommissioned their weapons before independent witnesses.

The group is noted for using an Irish language motto, &quot;Lámh Dearg Abú&quot; (Victory to the Red Hand) as opposed to a Latin motto like most other Loyalist groups.

<doc id="389516" wikidata="Q764262" url="?curid=389516" title="Red Hand Defenders">
<text>The Red Hand Defenders (RHD) is an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. It was formed in 1998 by loyalists who opposed the Belfast Agreement and the loyalist ceasefires. Its members were drawn mostly from the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). The name had first been used by Red Hand Commandos dissident Frankie Curry in 1996 and he was the leading figure in what was a somewhat unstructured organization until he was killed in 1999. It is named after the Red Hand of Ulster.

The RHD emerged when it claimed responsibility for a blast bomb attack on 7 September 1998 during a loyalist protest in Portadown. Loyalists had been protesting against the decision to ban the Orange Order from marching through the town&#x27;s mainly Catholic and Irish nationalist quarter (see Drumcree conflict). The attack killed a Catholic Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer. Since then, the RHD has claimed responsibility for killing a further ten people. It has also claimed responsibility for many pipe bomb attacks, mostly on the homes of Catholics. One of the RHD&#x27;s most notable attacks was the assassination of human rights lawyer Rosemary Nelson on 15 March 1999. She had represented alleged Irish republican paramilitaries, the family of Robert Hamill, and the Garvaghy Road Residents Association. Of the eleven people the RHD claimed to have killed, nine were civilians, one was a former UDA member and one was an RUC officer.

The RHD are a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000.

==Links with the wider loyalist movement==
It has been alleged that the name &quot;Red Hand Defenders&quot; is merely a covername for members of the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) so the organizations can claim on the surface to have honoured their ceasefire agreements. Similar accusations have been made regarding the name &quot;Orange Volunteers&quot;, another loyalist paramilitary group that emerged in 1998. Claims of responsibility by the RHD for certain attacks have overlapped with those of the Orange Volunteers. The Council on Foreign Relations indicates the membership of the RHD, LVF and Orange Volunteers likely overlap. These organizations are generally composed of young Ulster Protestant males from Northern Ireland.

McDonald (2001) characterizes the LVF and UDA ceasefire agreements as &quot;official fiction&quot;. The LVF denies these claims, stating that its armed campaign has ended. LVF members were aware that any breach of the ceasefire could result in the return to jail for those paramilitary prisoners freed as part of the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998. This essentially served as an incentive for the groups to create a cover name. As a result, the actual existence of the RHD has consistently been called into question. Jim Cusack and Henry McDonald have argued that the RHD and the Orange Volunteers are both overseen by a Christian fundamentalist preacher they identify only as the Pastor. The Pastor, a former associate of William McGrath, John McKeague and George Seawright and a long-established British intelligence agent, is said by the authors to provide his own form of fundamentalist, anti-Catholic Protestantism to the two groups&#x27; fluid membership of young men, most of whom are also UDA or LVF members.

==Ideology and &quot;modus operandi&quot;==
The Red Hand Defenders use violence toward the goal of maintaining British control in Northern Ireland. Like other loyalist groups, the RHD is an adversary of Irish nationalists who seek to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and create a united Ireland. In essence, (mostly) Irish Catholic nationalists aspire to be part of the Republic of Ireland, while (mostly) Protestant unionists wish to remain united with Great Britain. The resulting long-term conflict in Northern Ireland was often referred to as &quot;the Troubles&quot;. However, unlike the two biggest loyalist paramilitary groups—the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force—the group fully opposes the peace process and peace agreements, including the Good Friday Agreement.

Their tactics include shootings, bombings and arson, with victims usually being Catholic civilians. The religious emphasis has exacerbated the underlying political problems. The group&#x27;s civilian targets have included Catholic schools and Catholic postal workers. The weapons used by RHD members include pipe bombs, handguns and grenades. The group does not appear to receive aid from outside the UK.

==Notable attacks==
The RHD emerged when it claimed responsibility for a blast bomb attack on 7 September 1998 during a loyalist protest in Portadown. The loyalists had been protesting against the decision to ban the Orange Order from marching through the town&#x27;s mainly Irish Catholic and Irish nationalist quarter (see Drumcree conflict). The attack killed a Catholic Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) officer. Since then, the RHD has claimed responsibility for killing a further ten people. Of the eleven people the RHD claimed to have killed, nine were civilians, one was a former UDA member and one was an RUC officer. The group admitted shooting to death a Catholic man, Brian Service, while he was walking home in North Belfast on 31 October 1998, and to an attack on a pub in West Belfast earlier that day. 
One of the RHD&#x27;s most notable attacks was the assassination of human rights lawyer Rosemary Nelson on 15 March 1999. She had represented alleged Irish republican paramilitaries, the family of Robert Hamill, and the Garvaghy Road Residents Association. Nelson had been working with Prime Minister Tony Blair toward resolving the conflict in Northern Ireland. She had also testified in Washington, D.C. about the plight of attorneys who were subjected to harassment and threats for representing Irish nationalists. Nelson further informed that she and her family had received death threats. The killing of Nelson was a significant setback to the peace process due to a fear of the need for retaliation. Moreover, this killing was the first high-profile assassination since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. 
In August 2001, the RHD claimed responsibility for an attempted pipe-bomb attack on a Sinn Féin Member of Parliament and an attempted car bomb attack at a fair shortly thereafter where streets were filled with civilians, though both plots were thwarted by police. The RHD also claimed responsibility for the murder of a journalist named Martin O’Hagan in September 2001, who was shot dead while walking home from a pub with his wife. O’Hagan had previously been threatened by Ulster Volunteer Force brigadier Billy Wright, who became the leader of the LVF and was subsequently killed in the Maze Prison. The attack may have stemmed from the journalist&#x27;s report on alleged collusion between loyalist paramilitaries and security forces in Northern Ireland.

According to the U.S. Department of State, the RHD claimed responsibility for killing a total of five individuals in 2001. In 2002, the RHD claimed responsibility for the murders of a Catholic teenager and a Catholic postman (with the UDA and the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) also subsequently claiming responsibility for the attacks), and also bombed the home of a prison officer. On 16 January 2002, the RHD allegedly made a statement agreeing to &quot;stand down&quot; at the request of the UDA/UFF after threatening Catholic postal workers and teachers. The sincerity of the statement was immediately called into question. The RHD resumed its campaign a few months later with a nail-bomb attack on a well-known republican. The RHD successfully separated itself from the UDA in February 2003 with the murder of UDA member John Gregg, who had attempted to kill Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams almost 20 years before. The attack on Gregg may have stemmed from disapproval with the RHD that had been expressed by the UFF. The RHD is believed to have engaged in periodic bombings and shootings in 2003, and further claimed responsibility for an attack in September 2004.

<text>Jordi Sabater Pi (2 August 1922 – 5 August 2009) was a Spanish primatologist and worldwide specialist in ethology, the study of animal behavior. Sabater was known for describing the cultural behaviors of several species, including the use of tools by chimpanzees. During the 1960s, he purchased Snowflake, a very rare albino gorilla, and transported him to Barcelona Zoo, where he lived until his death in 2003.

Sabater Pi was born in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. He was professor of ethology at the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Barcelona and pioneered the study of animal behaviour and primatology in Spain. His line of work has been continued inside and outside the University of Barcelona by several of his disciples, such as Joaquim J. Veà Baró, Matthew Escobar Aliaga, and Montserrat Colell Mimó.

As a sign of his commitment to chimpanzees, and prompted by the finding of their proximity (both genetically and behavioural) with humans, and the threats hanging over their habitats, Sabater Pi once said that the decline in population and, in the case of some subspecies, their near extinction, was comparable to genocide among human beings. Since the initial years of the 21st century, Sabater Pi took sides in favour of the protection and conservation of primates, supporting projects such as the Proyecto Gran Simio in Spain or Fundación Mona in Girona.

A nature enthusiast, Jordi Sabater Pi was very passionate about his work. One of his pleasures was going out on expeditions to draw; he was known for producing numerous paintings which focused on animals and nature.

<text>Stanislav Grof (born July 1, 1931) is a Czech-born American psychiatrist. Grof is one of the principal developers of transpersonal psychology and research into the use of non-ordinary states of consciousness for purposes of psychological healing, deep self-exploration, and obtaining growth and insights into the human psyche.

== Early life and education ==
Stanislav Grof was born July 1, 1931 in Prague, Czechoslovak Republic. Grof received his M.D. from Charles University in Prague in 1957 and then completed his Ph.D. in medicine at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1965, training as a Freudian psychoanalyst at this time.

== Career ==
Czechoslovakia was the centre of psychedelic research behind the Iron Curtain during the 1950s and 1960s. Grof’s early research in the clinical uses of psychedelic substances was conducted at the Psychiatric Research Institute in Prague, where he was principal investigator of a program that systematically explored the heuristic and therapeutic potential of LSD and other psychedelic substances.

In 1967, he received a scholarship from the Foundations Fund for Research in Psychiatry in New Haven, Connecticut, and was invited by Joel Elkes to be a Clinical and Research Fellow at Henry Phipps Clinic, a part of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, United States. In 1969, he went on to become Chief of Psychiatric Research for the Spring Grove Experiment at the Research Unit of Spring Grove State Hospital (later part of the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center where he worked with Walter Pahnke. In 1969, Grof also became Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University.

In 1973 he was invited to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California, and lived there until 1987 as a Scholar-in-Residence, developing his ideas and conducting month-long workshops. In 1977, Grof was the founding president of the International Transpersonal Association, serving as president for several subsequent decades. He went on to become distinguished adjunct faculty member of the Department of Philosophy, Cosmology, and Consciousness at the California Institute of Integral Studies, a position he remained in until 2018.

In May 2020, he launched, with his wife Brigitte Grof, a new training in working with holotropic states of consciousness, the international Grof Legacy Training.

==Thought==
===Psychedelics and breathwork===
Grof&#x27;s early studies were of LSD and its effects on the psyche—the field of psychedelic therapy. Building on his observations while conducting LSD research and on Otto Rank&#x27;s theory of birth trauma, Grof constructed a theoretical framework regarding prenatal and perinatal psychology and transpersonal psychology. In Grof&#x27;s view, LSD sessions reveal the psychopathology of an individual to reflect their experience of the stages of birth. He describes four stages: (1) embryonic peace and transpersonal connection, (2) inundation with bodily matter during fetal growth, (3) the stress of the prenatal period, and (4) the release of birth. Various neuroses are mapped to traumas at particular stages, e.g. ennui could be caused by Caesarean section, resulting in an individual feeling like they have little reason to exert effort. Suicidal ideation is explained by the deep memory of prenatal suffering being terminated by release from the womb (transposed to an escape from life itself). Chemical addiction could stem from the use of anesthesia during birth. Religious belief (e.g. identification with the crucifixion of Jesus) is also linked to birth, with reincarnation explaining transpersonal experiences.

Grof called a developed form of his theory an &quot;expanded cartography of the human psyche&quot;. Following the suppression of legal LSD use in the early 1970s, Grof pursued this therapeutic direction without drugs, by codeveloping with his wife, Christina Grof, a combination of deep and rapid breathing, evocative music, focused bodywork, and mandala drawing. Originally termed &quot;Holotropic Breathwork&quot;, he now uses the trademark Grof Breathwork to describe this technique.

===Interplay of hylotropic and holotropic impulses in the psyche===
Grof distinguishes between two modes of consciousness: the &quot;hylotropic&quot; and the &quot;holotropic&quot;. The hylotropic mode relates to &quot;the normal, everyday experience of consensus reality&quot;. In contrast, holotropic is characteristic of non-ordinary states of consciousness such as meditative, mystical, or psychedelic experiences. According to Grof, contemporary psychiatry often categorizes these non-ordinary states as pathological. Grof connects the hylotropic to the Buddhist conception of namarupa (&quot;name and form&quot;), the separate, individual, illusory lower self. He connects the holotropic to the Hindu conception of Atman-Brahman.

===Hypothesis on near-death experiences===
In the late 1970s Grof proposed a psychological hypothesis to explain the near-death experience (NDE). According to Grof the NDE reflects memories of the birth process with the tunnel representing the birth canal. Susan Blackmore wrote that the hypothesis is &quot;pitifully inadequate to explain the NDE. For a start the newborn infant would not see anything like a tunnel as it was being born.&quot; The psychologist Chris French has written &quot;the experience of being born is only very superficially similar to the NDE&quot; and the hypothesis has been refuted as it is common for those born by caesarean section to experience a tunnel during the NDE. Michael Shermer also criticized the hypothesis &quot;there is no evidence for infantile memories of any kind. Furthermore, the birth canal does not look like a tunnel and besides the infant&#x27;s head is normally down and its eyes are closed.&quot; An article in the peer-reviewed APA journal &quot;Psychology of Consciousness&quot; suggested that Grof&#x27;s patients may have experienced false memories of birth and before birth.

==Influence on other researchers==
Grof&#x27;s collaboration with Richard Tarnas began in the early 1970s, when Tarnas moved to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur to write his dissertation on psychedelic therapy under the auspices of Grof. They would eventually research a new way of understanding the timing and content of experiences encountered in holotropic states of consciousness, which Tarnas refers to as &quot;archetypal cosmology&quot;.

== Accolades ==
In 1993, Grof received an Honorary Award from the Association for Transpersonal Psychology for major contributions to and development of the field of transpersonal psychology, given at the occasion of the 25th Anniversary Convocation held in Asilomar, California. He also received the VISION 97 award granted by the Foundation of Dagmar and Václav Havel in Prague on October 5, 2007. In 2010, he received the Thomas R. Verny Award from the Association for Pre- and Perinatal Psychology and Health.

== Documentaries ==
In 1962, Grof was in a short documentary about LSD called &quot;Looking for Toxin X&quot;.

Grof was featured in the film &quot;Entheogen: Awakening the Divine Within&quot;, a 2006 documentary about rediscovering an enchanted cosmos in the modern world.

The 2018 documentary &quot;Bufo Alvarius: The Underground Secret&quot; features Grof talking in detail about the effects of 5-MeO-DMT on the brain and consciousness.

In 2020, the documentary &quot;The Way of the Psychonaut&quot; was released, which explores Grof&#x27;s lifework and contributions to transpersonal psychology.

<doc id="389525" wikidata="Q818900" url="?curid=389525" title="Berechiah ha-Nakdan">
<text>Berechiah ben Natronai Krespia ha-Nakdan (; ) was a Jewish exegete, ethical writer, grammarian, translator, poet, and philosopher. His best-known works are &quot;Mishlè Shu&#x27;alim&quot; (&quot;Fox Fables&quot;) and &quot;Sefer ha-Ḥibbur&quot; (The Book of Compilation).

==Biography==
Little is known for certain about Berechiah&#x27;s life and much discussion has taken place concerning his date and native country. He is thought to have lived sometime in the 12th or 13th century, and is likely to have lived in Normandy and England, with some placing him about 1260 in Provence. It is possible that he was a descendant of Jewish scholars of Babylonia. He also knew foreign languages and translated and adapted several books into Hebrew.

Berechiah&#x27;s appellation &quot;ha-Nakdan&quot; (&quot;the punctuator&quot;) suggests that Berechiah punctuated Hebrew books. Hermann Gollancz, on the other hand, conjectured that he had a brother, a French Tosaphist, called Samuel ha-Nakdan who is mentioned for the year 1175 and that Berechiah was not so much a punctuator of the Bible himself but hailed from a family of &quot;Nakdanim&quot;.

Joseph Jacobs argued that Berechiah lived in England toward the end of the 12th century. This was confirmed by Adolf Neubauer&#x27;s discovery that, in the preface to his fables, Berechiah mentions the &quot;turning of the wheels of fate to the island of the sea (England) for one to die and the other to live,&quot; a reference to the English massacres of 1190. There is evidence that he was the same person as the Benedictus le Puncteur mentioned in a late-twelfth century Oxford document who presented a gift to Richard I in 1194, as Berechiah means &quot;blessed&quot; (&quot;benedictus&quot;) and ha-Nakdan means &quot;the punctuator&quot; (&quot;le puncteur&quot;).

Berechiah&#x27;s son, Elijah, who lived in Dreux, was a copyist and grammarian. In those of his texts which have survived he expresses his feeling of honour at his father&#x27;s respected position and refers to him as a &quot;&quot;tanna&quot; and pedant.&quot;

==&quot;Fox Fables&quot;==
Berechiah is known chiefly as the author of &quot;Mishle Shu&#x27;alim&quot; (, &#x27;Fox Fables&#x27;), a set of over a hundred fables in rhymed prose, some of his own invention and some reworked from Aesop&#x27;s Fables, the Talmud, and Eastern sources. Most were probably translated from the French fable collection &quot;Ysopet&quot; by Marie de France (though uncertainties about the exact dates of both authors preclude any final decision about which of them was the source for the other). Other likely sources include the Latin translations of Aesop by Romulus and Avianus and of the Panchatantra. Berechiah&#x27;s work adds a layer of Biblical quotations and allusions to Aesop&#x27;s tales, adapting them as a way to teach Jewish ethics.

The following fable (entitled The Wolf and the Animals) is one paralleled by Marie de France (no. 73), and derives from an Eastern source, probably the &quot;Vaka Jataka&quot;:

Manuscripts exist at the Bodleian and Munich Libraries (written before 1268). The first published edition appeared in Mantua in 1557; another with a Latin version by M. Hanel followed from Prague in 1661. An English translation titled &quot;Fables of a Jewish Aesop&quot; appeared in 1967 and has since been republished.

==Other works==
&quot;Sefer ha-Ḥibbur&quot; () is Berechiah&#x27;s best-known philosophical work, wherein he develops on the works of Saadia Gaon, Bahya ibn Pakuda, and Solomon ibn Gabirol. Berechiah was also the author of an ethical treatise entitled &quot;Sefer Matzref&quot;, divided into thirteen chapters. In it he quotes Rabbi Abraham ibn Daud (died c. 1198) without the formula for the dead, so that it is quite probable that the book was composed before 1180. In these essays he invented several Hebrew terms for philosophical concepts.

In addition to these, Berechiah wrote a commentary on the Book of Job. He was acquainted with most of the grammarians of the 11th and 12th centuries, and his &quot;Uncle Benjamin,&quot; whom he quotes, has been identified with Benjamin of Canterbury.

Berechiah was also a translator, his version being extant of Adelard of Bath&#x27;s &quot;Quæstiones Naturales&quot;, entitled &quot;Dodi ve-Nekhdi&quot; or &quot;Ha-She&#x27;elot&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Ko&#x27;aḥ Avanim&quot;, a translation-adaption of a Latin lapidary containing a description of sixty-three species of stones and their magical properties. Besides these works, Berechiah is also said by Zunz to have contributed to the &quot;Tosafot&quot;, and, as his name implies, was probably an expert in Hebrew grammar, for which reason he is quoted by Moses ben Issac ha-Nessiah of London, in his &quot;Sefer ha-Shoham.&quot; As this work was probably written before 1215, these references confirm the date and place suggested above.

<text>The Trenton Thunder are a collegiate summer baseball team of the MLB Draft League. They are located in Trenton, New Jersey, and play their home games at Trenton Thunder Ballpark.

From 1994 to 2020, it was a Minor League Baseball team of the Double-A Eastern League until Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minors following the 2020 season. Prior to this, they were affiliates of the Chicago White Sox (1980-1985), Detroit Tigers (1986-1994), Boston Red Sox (1995–2002), and New York Yankees (2003–2020).

==History==
===As a member of Minor League Baseball/Eastern League===
Trenton Thunder Baseball was established in 1994 with the relocation of the London Tigers from London, Ontario to Trenton, New Jersey, the London Tigers played at historic Labatt Park and served as a Detroit Tigers affiliate. The London Tigers were previously based at East Field Stadium in Glens Falls, New York under the names Glens Falls White Sox (1980–1985) as a Chicago White Sox affiliate and Glens Falls Tigers (1986-1988) as a Detroit Tigers affiliate. The Tigers affiliation moved with the relocation from London to Trenton but it lasted for one season only before switching affiliations to the Boston Red Sox in 1995. 

On June 4, 1994, Phil Stidham became the first Thunder alumnus to play in the major leagues, for the Detroit Tigers, giving up six runs on six hits, including two home runs, as part of a 21–7 romp by the Minnesota Twins. As a Red Sox affiliate, the club recorded three first-place finishes, but was eliminated from the playoffs in the first round each time. In 2003, the Thunder became the Yankees affiliate, and the Portland Sea Dogs became the new Red Sox affiliate. The switch reflected both teams&#x27; fanbases, as Central New Jersey is home to many Yankees fans, while Maine is home to many Red Sox fans. 

In , the Thunder became the first team in Minor League Baseball history to draw over 400,000 fans for 12 consecutive seasons at the Double-A level or below. Through 13 seasons, over 5.4 million people had attended a Thunder game.

Surpassing the previous mark of 8,729, set while Derek Jeter was on a rehab stint with the team, the Thunder set a new single-game attendance record on May 23, 2007, when 9,134 fans attended, to watch Roger Clemens make his second minor-league start, as he worked toward a return to the Yankees. On Sunday, July 3, 2011, a paid attendance of 9,212 set a new record, as Derek Jeter returned once again, for a rehab start.

On September 15, 2007, the Thunder defeated the Akron Aeros to win their first Eastern League Championship Series in team history. Trenton defended its league title with 5–1 win over the Aeros on September 14, 2008. The Thunder lost to the Altoona Curve in the 2010 Eastern League Championship Series.

In 2013, the Minor League Baseball website named the Trenton Thunder the Minor League team of the year. Trenton also took home two other awards which included &quot;Promo of the Year&quot; for the Retirement Party for team bat dog Chase That Golden Thunder. The 13-year-old Golden Retriever retired this year and in his final game the team included a bobble head give away in honor of the long time mascot. The third award was for &quot;Mascot of the Year&quot; which included an online four minute which garnered the most hits of any other team&#x27;s mascot video.

===As a member of the MLB Draft League===
On November 7, 2020, the Yankees announced that they would end their affiliation with the Thunder organization in favor of the previously independent Somerset Patriots, located in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey. The Thunder organization was offered the Patriots&#x27; spot in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. Instead, they became members of the newly created MLB Draft League, which serves as a showcase for draft-eligible prospects.

The Thunder organization won the first MLB Draft League title in 2021.

====Triple-A Buffalo Bisons====
In April 2021, it was announced that the Thunder organization will host the Buffalo Bisons, the Triple-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. “After 27 years serving as the Double-A home of the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox, and New York Yankees, we are excited to welcome the highest level of Minor League Baseball to New Jersey,” said Jeff Hurley, Thunder GM &amp; COO. “We look forward to working with the Bisons, Blue Jays, and Major League Baseball to make this a successful season start.” The Blue Jays began the 2021 MLB season by calling their spring training facilities in Dunedin, Florida, as a result of COVID-19 restrictions in Canada. Toronto had played the coronavirus-shortened 60-game 2020 season in Buffalo. According to the Bisons, the move to Trenton allowed the club to complete a joint renovation project to prepare Buffalo’s Sahlen Field for major-league regular-season games. Buffalo expects the upgrades will “far exceed the new required Major League Baseball Player Development League facility standards, making Sahlen Field one of the premier locations for player training and performance amenities in Minor League Baseball.” 

At the Bisons home games in Trenton, the Bisons wore the Trenton Thunder uniforms and were referred to as Trenton Thunder while the Thunder MLB Draft League team was referred to as Draft League Thunder by the Thunder organization; the Bisons were still referred to as the Buffalo Bisons on the road and the Thunder MLB Draft League team was referred to as Trenton Thunder on the road. The Bisons played the season through July in Trenton and moved back to Buffalo for August. As of September 4, 2023, Team President Jeff Hurley stated that the team&#x27;s goal is to be affiliated again with a major league organization.

==Ballpark==

The Thunder have played at Trenton Thunder Ballpark since the team&#x27;s inception in 1994. The ballpark was previously named Mercer County Waterfront Park from its inaugural season until 2012, when it was renamed Arm &amp; Hammer Park as part of a sponsorship deal with Arm &amp; Hammer that lasted until 2021. Trenton Thunder Ballpark has a capacity of 6,440, the largest for any home ballpark in the MLB Draft League.

==Team culture==

=== Mascots ===

==== Boomer ====
The Thunder&#x27;s mascot is a blue &quot;Thunderbird&quot; named Boomer. He wears a Thunder uniform as well as purple and yellow shades. Boomer traditionally takes part in many of the promotions and activities throughout Thunder home games, such as a race around the bases against a young fan. Boomer&#x27;s likeness has appeared on numerous pieces of merchandise, and he is involved with several programs assisting children in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

==== Cloudman ====
Cloudman is the Thunder&#x27;s newest mascot, debuting during the 2015 season. He is a fearless caped crusader who serves the greater good in our community. The Cloudman&#x27;s Hometown Heroes program debuted in 2015. Fans have the opportunity to nominate local heroes in their community to be honored in the middle of the seventh inning of every home game. Current and former armed forces members, first-responders and individuals who do good in the community are often nominated. Cloudman can be seen all over Arm &amp; Hammer Park during a Thunder game, usually in tandem with Boomer, the Thunder&#x27;s original mascot. Together Cloudman and Boomer take part in such in-game activities as shooting T-shirts off into the crowd, racing a youngster around the bases for a prize, and competing against one another to pick the loudest section in the stadium on a given night.

=== Batdogs ===

Chase &quot;That Golden Thunder&quot; was a Golden Retriever who was part of the Thunder family from late in the 2002 season until his death in 2013. He often served as &quot;batdog&quot; during the first inning at most Thunder home games, retrieving bats and balls and returning them to the Thunder dugout.Later in the game, Chase usually caught frisbees to win a cash prize for a lucky fan. Chase had garnered significant media attention, appearing on FOX, CNN, YES Network, UPN9, WNBC4, and even Japanese television. In 2008, Chase sired a litter of pups. One of the pups was trained to be his successor and was named Home Run Derby (or Derby for short) in a fan poll during the offseason. Another of the pups from that litter was named Ollie, and served as a batdog for the New Hampshire Fisher Cats until September, 2016. Chase died July 8, 2013, aged 13. He was diagnosed with cancer in February and had been suffering from arthritis.

One of Derby&#x27;s pups, Rookie, has been trained to keep the family business intact as a third-generation &quot;batdog&quot;. In 2017, Rookie and Derby shared &quot;batdog&quot; duties with Rookie retrieving bats in the first inning and Derby retrieving in the second inning during every game. On January 8, 2018, Derby died from cancer. Rookie became the Thunder&#x27;s batdog beginning with the 2018 season.

=== Alternate identities ===
In 2018, the team began to temporarily rename itself as the Thunder Pork Roll, honoring Trenton&#x27;s role in developing the Pork roll. The Pork Roll would play every Friday home game at Trenton Thunder Ballpark wearing Thunder navy blue/light blue uniforms with a &quot;Pork Roll&quot; wordmark logo on the front. In 2024, the Thunder Pork Roll refreshed the original on-field uniforms, switching from blue to pink to further celebrate the local favorite breakfast food.

In 2019, as part of Minor League Baseball&#x27;s Copa de la Diversion promotion to celebrate Latino heritage, the Thunder created the Spanish-language identity El Trueno de Trenton.

In 2024, the Thunder expanded on their long, pioneering tradition of bat dogs in the franchise, temporarily renaming themselves as the Trenton Goldens on select nights during the season. The Goldens first took the field on June 26th, donning a white jersey with black accents with the Goldens wordmark across the chest, as well as a gold cap with the Goldens&#x27; G lettermark. In the second half of the season, the Goldens would return again wearing their secondary on-field cap- black with the Goldens hydrant logo. With the overwhelming positive response from fans, the Trenton Thunder announced the team would permanently keep the Goldens brand alongside their other identities.

==Ownership==
Joe Plumeri, Trenton-born and Vice Chairman of the First Data Board of Directors, Joseph Finley and Joseph Caruso are the owners of the Trenton Thunder. Together, they make up Garden State Baseball, LP. Both Plumeri and Finley also owned the Jersey Shore BlueClaws as American Baseball Company, LLC until July 2017. Finley also is part owner of the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.
