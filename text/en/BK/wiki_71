<text>The Monk: A Romance is a Gothic novel by Matthew Gregory Lewis, published in 1796 across three volumes. Written early in Lewis&#x27;s career, it was published before he turned twenty, and he withheld his name from the first edition. It tells the story of a virtuous monk who gives into his lustful urges, setting off a chain of events that leave him damned. It is a prime example of the type of Gothic that specializes in horror. 

Upon publication, the novel proved scandalous. Readers were shocked by its sexually explicit content, and themes of rape and incest, leading it to become arguably the most controversial Gothic novel of the 18th century. There was public outcry, but the novel was hugely popular. Over time, Lewis came to feel that its writing had been in poor taste. Later editions were heavily censored by the author himself. 

&quot;The Monk&quot; is considered part of the gothic literary canon, a forerunner to the popular gothic novels of the 19th century, and an influence on the modern horror genre. It has been adapted or significantly inspired a number of plays, films, and writings.

==Plot==
The story revolves around a devoted monk, Ambrosio, who is tempted to break his sacred vows when a young man, Rosario, reveals that he is a woman, also known as &quot;Matilda,&quot; and comes to the monastery and disguises himself as a nun to become closer to him. Caught between two strong plotlines—one being a struggle between sexual desire and religious integrity—Ambrosio soon succumbs to the temptations he has sought his entire life to shun. It is one of the most important Gothic novels of its time, often imitated and adapted for stage and the screen.

=== Ambrosio, the monk ===
Ambrosio was left at an abbey in Madrid as an infant and is now a famously celebrated monk. A beautiful and virtuous young woman, Antonia, goes to hear one of his sermons, and meets Lorenzo, who falls in love with her.

Ambrosio&#x27;s closest friend among the monks, Rosario, reveals that he is a woman named Matilda, who disguised herself to be near Ambrosio. While picking a rose for her, Ambrosio is bitten by a serpent and falls deathly ill. Matilda nurses him. When he recovers, Matilda reveals that she sucked the poison from Ambrosio&#x27;s wound and is now dying herself. At the point of her death, Matilda begs him to make love to her, and he agrees reluctantly. After having sex with Ambrosio, Matilda performs a ritual in the cemetery which cures her of the poison. She and Ambrosio continue to be secret lovers, but Ambrosio grows tired of her.

Ambrosio meets Antonia and is immediately attracted to her. He begins visiting Antonia&#x27;s mother regularly, hoping to seduce Antonia. In the meantime, Lorenzo has secured his family&#x27;s blessing for his marriage with Antonia. Matilda tells Ambrosio she can help him gain Antonia&#x27;s charms, the same way she was healed of the poison: witchcraft. Ambrosio is initially horrified, but agrees. Matilda and Ambrosio return to the cemetery, where Matilda calls upon Lucifer, who appears young and handsome. He gives Matilda a magic myrtle bough, which will allow Ambrosio to open any door, as well as rape Antonia without her knowing. Ambrosio uses the magic bough to enter Antonia&#x27;s bedroom. He is on the point of raping her when Antonia&#x27;s mother arrives and confronts him. In panic, Ambrosio murders her and returns to the abbey, unsatisfied in his lust and horrified that he has now become a murderer.

Antonia, grief-stricken at the death of her mother, sees her mother&#x27;s ghost. She faints and Ambrosio is called to help. Matilda helps Ambrosio acquire a concoction that will put Antonia in a deathlike coma. While attending to Antonia, Ambrosio administers the poison, and Antonia appears to die. He takes Antonia to the crypt beneath the convent, where, she awakens from her drugged sleep and Ambrosio rapes her. Afterward, he is as disgusted with Antonia as he was with Matilda, who arrives to warn him that the convent is burning down due to a riot (caused by the events of Raymond and Agnes&#x27;s story). Antonia attempts to escape, and Ambrosio kills her.

Ambrosio and Matilda are brought before the Inquisition. Matilda confesses her guilt and is sentenced to death. Before she is executed, she sells her soul to the devil in exchange for her freedom and her life. Ambrosio insists upon his innocence and is tortured. He is visited by Matilda, who tells him to yield his soul to Satan. Ambrosio again proclaims his innocence, but when faced with torture, he admits to his sins of rape, murder, and sorcery and is condemned to burn. In despair, Ambrosio asks Lucifer to save his life, who tells him it will be at the cost of his soul. Ambrosio is reluctant to give up the hope of God&#x27;s forgiveness, but Lucifer tells him that there is none. After much resistance, Ambrosio signs the contract. Lucifer transports him from his cell to the wilderness. Lucifer informs him that Antonia&#x27;s mother, whom he murdered, was also his mother, making Antonia his sister, adding to his crimes the sin of incest. Ambrosio then learns that he accepted Lucifer&#x27;s deal only moments before he was to be pardoned. Lucifer reveals that it has long been his plan to gain Ambrosio&#x27;s soul, and Matilda was a demon helping him. Finally, Lucifer points out the loophole in the deal Ambrosio struck: Ambrosio only asked to get out of his cell. Lucifer carries Ambrosio into the sky and drops him onto rocks below. Ambrosio suffers for six days before dying alone and damned for eternity.

=== Raymond and Agnes ===
Lorenzo&#x27;s sister, Agnes, is a nun at the nearby abbey who is romantically involved with Raymond, son of a Marquis. Ambrosio hears the confession of the nuns at Agnes&#x27;s convent. When Agnes confesses that she is pregnant with Raymond&#x27;s child, Ambrosio turns her over to the Prioress of her abbey for punishment.

Lorenzo confronts Raymond about his relationship with his sister Agnes. Raymond tells their long history. Raymond was travelling in Germany when he was nearly killed by bandits. He avoided being killed, and rescued a Baroness who was also travelling. Visiting the Baroness afterward, Raymond fell in love with her niece Agnes. However, the Baroness was in love with Raymond; when he refused her advances, she made arrangements to send Agnes to a convent. Raymond and Agnes made plans to elope before Agnes left her aunt&#x27;s castle for the convent. Agnes planned to dress as the Bleeding Nun, a ghost who haunted the castle and exited its gates at midnight. Raymond accidentally eloped with the real ghost of the real Bleeding Nun. Exorcising the ghost of the Bleeding Nun required assistance from the Wandering Jew. When Raymond was free, he found Agnes in the convent. There he seduced Agnes. When she discovered that she was pregnant, she begged him to help her escape.

When Raymond finishes his story, Lorenzo agrees to help him elope with Agnes. He acquires a papal bull releasing Agnes from her vows as a nun so that she may marry Raymond. However, when he shows it to the Prioress, she tells Lorenzo that Agnes died several days before. Lorenzo does not believe it, but after two months, there is no other word concerning Agnes. Eventually, to try to find Agnes, Raymond&#x27;s servant disguises himself as a beggar and goes to the convent, where Mother St. Ursula sneaks him a note that tells Raymond to have the cardinal arrest the Prioress for Agnes&#x27;s murder.

During a procession honouring Saint Clare, the Prioress is arrested. Mother St. Ursula publicly describes Agnes&#x27;s death at the hand of the sisters. When the procession crowd hears that the Prioress is a murderer, they turn into a rioting mob. They kill the Prioress, attack other nuns, and set the convent on fire. In the confusion, Lorenzo finds a group of nuns and a young woman named Virginia hiding in the crypt. Lorenzo discovers a passage leading down into a dungeon, where he finds Agnes, alive and holding the dead body of the baby she had given birth to while abandoned in the dungeon. With Virginia&#x27;s help, Lorenzo rescues Agnes and the other nuns from the crypt.

Virginia visits Lorenzo as he is recovering from his grief and the two become closer. Agnes tells the story of her miserable experience in the dungeon. Agnes and Raymond are married, and the couple leaves Madrid for Raymond&#x27;s castle, accompanied by Lorenzo and Virginia, who are also eventually married.

==Characters==
* Agnes is Don Lorenzo&#x27;s younger sister and Don Raymond&#x27;s lover. Her mother fell ill while pregnant with Agnes and vowed to send Agnes to the convent if she delivered her safely. She is a virtuous young lady who intends to marry Don Raymond but her parents want her to become a nun, so she decides to run away with him. Their plans are foiled and, thinking Don Raymond has abandoned her forever, she enters the convent.
* Ambrosio is an extremely devout monk about 30 years old. He was found left at the Abbey doorstep when he was too young to tell his tale. The monks consider him a present from the Virgin Mary and they educate him at the monastery.
* Antonia is a timid and innocent girl of 15. She was brought up in an old castle in Murcia with only her mother Elvira and is therefore very sheltered. She is the object of Don Lorenzo&#x27;s attentions. The novel&#x27;s evil characters are considered to be better written than the virtuous ones, and Antonia&#x27;s character is so virtuous that some have found her &quot;deadly dull&quot;.
* Elvira is the mother of Antonia and Ambrosio. She married a young nobleman in secret. His family does not approve of her and because of this she and her husband escape to the Indies, leaving her 2-year-old son behind. After 13 years, when Antonia is very young, her husband dies and she returns to Murcia where she lives on an allowance given to her by her father-in-law.
* Leonella is Elvira&#x27;s sister and Antonia&#x27;s spinster aunt. She takes an immediate dislike to Ambrosio after hearing his sermon. She believes Don Christoval&#x27;s polite attentions are more significant than they actually are and is hurt when he fails to call at her house. She eventually marries a younger man and lives in Cordova.
* Don Lorenzo de Medina is Agnes&#x27;s older brother and friend of Don Raymond and Don Christoval. Immediately intrigued by Antonia after meeting her at Ambrosio&#x27;s sermon, Don Lorenzo resolves to marry her.
* Matilda is first known as Rosario, the young boy who looks up to Ambrosio &quot;with a respect approaching idolatry&quot;. Rosario is brought to the Monastery by a well dressed rich stranger but not much more is known of his past. He always hides under his cowl and later reveals that he is actually Matilda, a beautiful young lady who loves Ambrosio. Matilda &#x27;loved&#x27; Ambrosio even before she joined the monastery (as a boy), and therefore requested a painting of herself as Madonna to be given to Ambrosio, which hangs in his room. She seduces Ambrosio and aids in his destruction of Antonia with magic. The character of Matilda was highly praised by Coleridge as Lewis&#x27;s masterpiece, and is said to be &quot;exquisitely imagined&quot; and &quot;superior in wickedness to the most wicked of men.&quot; Though she is considered by some critics to be the most intelligent, articulate, and interesting, she is difficult to characterise. The plot of the novel relies on her being a supernatural force with magical powers, but she begins as a human. She tells Ambrosio she loves him when she thinks he is asleep and cries &quot;involuntary&quot; tears when she realises he no longer cares for her. These passages, together with the haste in which the novel was written, seem to indicate &quot;that Lewis changed his mind in the course of the narrative&quot;.
* The Prioress, also known as Mother St. Agatha, punishes Agnes severely to uphold the honour of the convent of St. Clare. &quot;Viciously cruel in the name of virtue&quot;, she keeps Agnes prisoner in the dungeons beneath the convent with only enough bread and water to sustain her but not nourish her. The prioress circulates the story of Agnes&#x27;s death to everyone, including Agnes&#x27;s own relations. She is beaten to a bloody pulp by the crowd that gathers to honour St. Clare when they realise she is responsible for Agnes&#x27;s supposed death. She is also the inspiration for the Abbess of San Stephano in Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Italian&quot;.
* Don Raymond is the son of a Marquis and is also known as Alphonso d&#x27;Alvarada. He takes the name Alphonso when his father, by the urging of his friend the Duke of Villa Hermosa, advises him that taking a new name will allow him to be known for his merits rather than his rank. He travels to Paris, but finds the Parisians &quot;frivolous, unfeeling and insincere&quot; and sets out for Germany. Near Strasbourg he is forced to seek accommodations in a cottage after his chaise supposedly breaks down. He is the target of the robber Baptiste but with help from Baptiste&#x27;s wife Marguerite, Raymond is able to save himself and the Baroness Lindenberg. Grateful, the Baroness invites Don Raymond to stay with her and her husband at their castle in Bavaria.
* Donna Rodolpha, Baroness of Lindenburg meets Don Raymond while travelling to Strasbourg. She is in love with Don Raymond and becomes jealous when she finds out Don Raymond is in love with her niece, Agnes. She asks him to leave the Castle of Lindenberg and later speaks poorly of his character.
* Mother St. Ursula assists in Agnes&#x27;s rescue. She is a witness to the Prioress&#x27;s crimes and without her, Don Lorenzo would not be able to accuse the Prioress.
* Theodore is Don Raymond&#x27;s page. He enjoys writing poetry and authors the poems &quot;Love and Age&quot; and &quot;The Water King&quot;. After reading &quot;Love and Age&quot;, Don Raymond points out the flaws in the piece, which may be flaws Lewis noticed in his own work. Far from being the unwaiveringly faithful servant stock character, Theodore plays a key role in moving the plot forward by helping with Don Raymond&#x27;s plans to escape with Agnes. Theodore&#x27;s character also provides foreshadowing through his poems. His poems parallel the action of the story. For instance, in his poem &quot;The Water King&quot;, the lovely maid&#x27;s fate foreshadows Antonia&#x27;s. In addition, Theodore also bears a striking resemblance to other characters in other of Lewis&#x27;s works, including Leolyn in One O&#x27;clock (1811) and Eugene in &quot;Mistrust&quot; from Romantic Tales (1808).
* Virginia de Villa Franca, introduced late in the story, is a beautiful, virtuous young relation of the Prioress who represents St. Clare in the Procession. Virginia nurses the ill Agnes back to health and thus wins Lorenzo&#x27;s affections. Like Isabella in &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, she is introduced as an acceptable marriage partner for Lorenzo, but plays an unessential part in the plot.

==Publication history==
===Composition===
Lewis said he got his first inspiration for the novel from a short story by Richard Steele called &quot;The History of Santon Barsisa,&quot; which was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1713. Lewis summarized the story as the tale of &quot;a holy man led by the devil into seduction and murder and tricked at the point of death into forfeiting his soul.&quot; In one letter, Lewis claimed to have written &quot;The Monk&quot; in ten weeks, but other correspondence suggests that he had at least started it, or something similar, a couple of years earlier.

===First edition===
The first edition of &quot;The Monk&quot; was published some time between 1795 and 1796. Older scholarship tended toward a 1795 publication year, but because no copies of the book so dated could be found, and because contemporary sources did not begin announcing or referencing the work until March 1796, the latter date began to be preferred. It was published anonymously, but for Lewis&#x27;s initials after the preface and was highly praised by reviewers in &quot;The Monthly Mirror&quot; of June 1796 as well as the &quot;Analytical Review&quot;.

===Second edition===
The first edition sold well, and a second edition was published in October 1796. The good sales and reviews of the first had emboldened Lewis, and he signed the new edition with his full name, adding &quot;M.P.&quot; to reflect his newly acquired seat in the House of Commons. The book continued to rise in popularity, but in a February 1797 review by a writer for the &quot;European Magazine&quot;, the novel was criticised for &quot;plagiarism, immorality, and wild extravagance.&quot;

===Fourth edition===
Lewis wrote to his father on 23 February 1798, attempting to make reparations: the controversy caused by &quot;The Monk&quot; was a source of distress to his family. As recorded by Irwin: “&quot;twenty&quot; is not the age at which prudence is most to be expected. Inexperience prevented my distinguishing what should give offence; but as soon as I found that offence was given, I made the only reparation in my power: I carefully revised the work, and expunged every syllable on which could be grounded the slightest construction of immorality. This, indeed, was no difficult task, for the objection rested entirely on expressions too strong, and words carelessly chosen; not on the sentiments, characters, or general tendency of the work&quot;.

The fourth edition of the novel was published in 1798, and, according to Peck, &quot;contains nothing which could endanger the most fragile virtue... He expunged every remotely offensive word in his three volumes, with meticulous attention to &quot;lust&quot;. Ambrosio, formerly a &quot;ravisher&quot;, becomes an &quot;intruder&quot; or &quot;betrayer&quot;; his &quot;incontinence&quot; changes to &quot;weakness&quot; or &quot;infamy&quot;, his &quot;lust&quot; to &quot;desire&quot;, his &quot;desires&quot; to &quot;emotions&quot;. Having &quot;indulged in excesses&quot; for three editions, he &quot;committed an error&quot; in the fourth&quot;. Lewis wrote an apology for &quot;The Monk&quot; in the preface of another work, as recorded by Peck:&quot;Without entering into the discussion whether the principles inculcated in &quot;The Monk&quot; are right or wrong, or whether the &quot;means&quot; by which the story is conducted is likely to do more mischief than the &quot;tendency&quot; is likely to produce good, I solemnly declare, that when I published the work I had no idea that its publication &quot;could&quot; be prejudicial; if I was wrong, the error proceeded from my judgment, not from my intention. Without entering into the merits of the advice which it proposes to convey, or attempting to defend (what I now condemn myself) the &quot;language and manner&quot; in which that advice was delivered, I solemnly declare, that in writing the passage which regards the Bible (consisting of a single page, and the only passage which I ever wrote on the subject) I had not the most distant intention to bring the sacred Writings into contempt, and that, had I suspected it of producing such an effect, I should not have written the paragraph&quot;.

==Reviews==
Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote a piece in &quot;The Critical Review&quot;, in which he both praises and criticizes the novel. He acknowledges that it is &quot;the offspring of no common genius,&quot; and that the &quot;underplot... is skillfully and closely connected with the main story, and is subservient to its development.&quot; However he notes that, ”we declare it to be our opinion, that &quot;the Monk&quot; is a romance, which if a parent saw in the hands of a son or daughter, he might reasonably turn pale&quot;.

Thomas James Mathias followed Coleridge&#x27;s lead in &quot;The Pursuits of Literature&quot;, a poem in the 18th-Century satiric tradition, but takes a step farther than Coleridge by claiming that a specific passage made the novel indictable under law. The passage, found in Chapter Seven Volume II, discusses an interpretation of the Bible as too lewd for youth to read.

These two major pieces led the way for a multitude of other attacks on the novel, from such sources as the &quot;Monthly Review&quot;, the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Scots Magazine&quot;; the last of these attacked the novel six years after its publication. It was a general trend amongst those who criticised, however, to offer praise of some aspect of the novel. &quot;It looked,&quot; writes André Parreaux, &quot;as if every reviewer or critic of the book, no matter how hostile he was, felt compelled to at least pay lip-service to Lewis&#x27;s genius.&quot;

The criticism of his novel, extending even into criticism of his person, never truly left Lewis, and an attack on his character was published by the &quot;Courier&quot; posthumously, calling itself a &quot;just estimate of his character.&quot; As recorded by MacDonald: &quot;He had devoted the first fruits of his mind to the propagation of evil, and the whole long harvest was burnt up ... There is a moral in the life of this man ... He was a reckless defiler of the public mind; a profligate, he cared not how many were to be undone when he drew back the curtain of his profligacy; he had infected his reason with the insolent belief that the power to corrupt made the right, and that conscience might be laughed, so long as he could evade law. &quot;The Monk&quot; was an eloquent evil; but the man who compounded it knew in his soul that he was compounding poison for the multitude, and in that knowledge he sent it into the world&quot;.

There were those who defended &quot;The Monk&quot; as well. Joseph Bell, publisher of the novel, spent half of his essay &quot;Impartial Strictures on the Poem Called &quot;The Pursuits of Literature&quot; and Particularly a Vindication of the Romance of &quot;The Monk&quot;&quot; defending Lewis; Thomas Dutton, in his &quot;Literary Census: A Satirical Poem&quot;, retaliated against Mathias and praised Lewis; Henry Francis Robert Soame compared Lewis to Dante in his &quot;The Epistle in Rhyme to M. G. Lewis, Esq. M. P.&quot;

&quot;Assurances that &quot;The Monk&quot; was not as dangerous as its enemies maintained failed to dampen its success with the reading public&quot;, writes Peck. &quot;They had been told that the book was horrible, blasphemous, and lewd, and they rushed to put their morality to the test&quot;. Indeed, the novel&#x27;s popularity continued to rise and by 1800 there were five London and two Dublin editions.

== Manuscripts ==
An original manuscript is in the collections of Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum, Isle of Ely.

The W&amp;F Museum was awarded a grant of £7,222 in 2022 for the conservation and digitisation of the manuscript of The Monk by M.G. Lewis which is part of the Townshend Collection.

==Major themes==
=== Struggle with temptation ===

Ambrosio displays traces of hubris and lust very early in the novel. It is explained that &quot;he [Ambrosio] dismissed them [the monks] with an air of conscious superiority, in which humility&#x27;s semblance combated with the reality of pride. Similarly, &quot;he fixed his eyes on the Virgin… Gracious God, should I then resist the temptation? Should I not barter for a single embrace the reward of my sufferings for thirty years?&quot; Both passages explicitly show the conflicting forces, that is, the moral choices that rage within Ambrosio. His nature instructs him to exult himself above others and lust for the Virgin Mary, while his religious inclinations, or at least his awareness of his position within the church, command him to humility and chastity. Ambrosio begins to deviate from his holy conduct when he encounters Matilda, a character revealed at the end of the novel to be an emissary of Satan. Ambrosio&#x27;s story focuses on temptation which is made to be extreme by the oppression of his upbringing. All of these circumstances are consistent with the classic model of the morality tale, and, true to form, once Ambrosio is tempted into sin he enters into a tailspin of increasing desire, which leads him to transgression and culminates in the loss of his eternal salvation and his grisly murder at the hands of the devil.

This pattern of wicked actions leading to ill consequences is exactly what is expected in a morality tale and is reflected in other Gothic novels. For example, Lewis&#x27;s work is often discussed in conjunction with that of Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s. Robert Miles writes that &quot;Ann Radcliffe and Matthew Lewis were the two most significant Gothic novelists of the 1790s, an estimate of their importance shared by their contemporaries.&quot;. Indeed, the repercussions of malevolent and self-serving actions are represented extraordinarily well in Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Romance of the Forest&quot;. The Marquis in the story was driven to murder for &quot;the title of his brother… and riches which would enable him to indulge his voluptuous inclinations.&quot; Similar to Ambrosio, the Marquis was tempted and succumbed to sin, which sets him on a wicked path leading to his public shame and suicide.

=== The triumph of evil ===
Matilda is the catalyst of evil in The Monk, as Ambrosio battles the temptations she exposes him to. The first triumph of evil seen in the novel occurs after Matilda has saved Ambrosio&#x27;s life by sucking out poison from a snake bite. When Ambrosio finds out about her allegedly altruistic sacrifice, she is able to exploit his gratitude. In order to save Matilda, Ambrosio must break the vows he has held for the entirety of his life and expose himself to evil. Throughout the story Matilda wields pity, lust, and innocence as a weapon, breaking down the beliefs Ambrosio used to define himself by. The rest of the story is the result of Matilda&#x27;s influence over Ambrosio as she leads him through progressively unforgivable sins— rape, murder, and witchcraft—until he eventually signs his own soul over to the devil. The story&#x27;s many horrific acts and their consequences for other characters are also victories of evil, but the pinnacle of evil is Ambrosio&#x27;s total relinquishment of his beliefs when he offers his soul to the devil.

=== Harm to innocents ===

Lewis also deviates from what is typically expected from morality tales when he includes the sacrifice of innocent people in the latter chapters of the novel. As a result of Ambrosio&#x27;s personal vices, both Elvira and Antonia are slain. Elvira finds Ambrosio, &quot;the man whom Madrid esteems a saint…at this late hour near the couch of my unhappy child&quot; on the verge of committing rape and Ambrosio murders her to prevent her from revealing his crimes. Elvira was guilty of no crime and throughout the novel was committed to the welfare of her family and her daughter in particular. Likewise, Antonia is murdered to prevent her from alerting Officers of the Inquisition of Ambrosio&#x27;s crimes. Antonia is also undeserving of her fate, as she was always a loyal daughter and honest woman throughout the novel.

Another Gothic novel in which one individual&#x27;s quest for a gratification of the senses leads to the ruin of others is &quot;Vathek&quot; by William Beckford. In the novel, the Caliph Vathek attempts to sacrifice fifty children to a demon to gain his favour. Without mercy he &quot;pushed the poor innocent into the gulph [open to hell].&quot; Similarly, in &quot;The Necromancer&quot; by Lawrence Flammenberg, an entire village is sacrificed to a troop of banditti who are angered at their hideout being revealed. The leader of group explaining that &quot;the villagers are not yet punished… for having assisted them, but they shall not escape their doom.&quot; Admittedly, &quot;Vathek&quot; can be more readily identified as a morality tale, but &quot;The Necromancer&quot; warns against the pernicious effects of a legal system that is bereft of mercy. A criminal declares during his confession that his life &quot;will afford a useful lesson to judges, and teach the guardians of the people to be careful how they inflict punishments if they will not make a complete rogue of many a hapless wretch…&quot;

=== Anti-Catholic themes ===

&quot;The Monk&quot; is one of many Gothic novels that criticises the Catholic Church and Catholic tradition. By the time of the Gothic novel, the English were, to some extent, institutionally anti-Catholic. Characters such as the wicked abbess, the unchaste nun, and the lascivious monk represent the naked anti-Catholicism projected by the Gothic. Lewis&#x27;s condemnation of the Church is apparent throughout the novel in his characterisation of Catholic religious. Ambrosio and the Prioress represent all that is seen as wrong with the Catholic Church. The vow of celibacy, which many Protestant writers at the time condemned as unnatural, is presented as contributing significantly to Ambrosio&#x27;s repressed sexuality, which in turn leads to the heinous acts he commits against Antonia. Agnes&#x27;s breaking of her vow is seen by the Prioress as an unforgivable crime, which drives her to punish Agnes so severely. Blakemore argues that in England, the sexual demonization of the aberrant Catholic &quot;Other&quot; was part and parcel of the ideological formation of the English, Protestant national identity.&quot;

Lewis also appears to mock Catholic superstition through use of iconoclasm repeatedly over the course of the novel, such as when Lorenzo moves a statue of the virgin St. Clare to reveal the chamber in which Agnes is being kept prisoner. This demystification of idols makes light of Catholic superstition in relation to statues and sacred objects. Lewis&#x27;s treatment of the Catholic Church clearly shows that he harbours negative sentiments about the Church&#x27;s activities.

The lack of divinity shown throughout the novel is not unique to &quot;The Monk&quot;. John Moore&#x27;s &quot;Zeluco&quot; focuses on the nefarious plots of a single man who cannot control his passions. Like Ambrosio, Zeluco&#x27;s disposition is shown very early in the novel to be disagreeable. In his youth Zeluco &quot;seized it [his pet sparrow] with his hand, and while it struggled to get free, with a curse he squeezed the little animal to death.&quot; Zeluco continually gratifies his vices much to his discredit and dishonor, and, as in &quot;The Monk&quot;, his sins compound upon themselves culminating in the infanticide of his only son. Unlike Ambrosio, however, Zeluco has no physical demons spurring him onwards, but rather his insatiable appetite for sin.

=== Sinful sexuality ===

The Bleeding Nun, who appears in the subplot of Raymond and Agnes, epitomises the sin of erotic desires. Raymond mistakes her for his lover, Agnes, because she is veiled and he cannot see her face. The veil that &quot;conceals and inhibits sexuality comes by the same gesture to represent it.&quot; Both Antonia and Matilda are veiled to protect their virginity and innocence and it is expected that Agnes also covers her face for this reason when she meets Raymond. However, the removal of the veil reveals the Bleeding Nun, dead and punished because of her sins. While she was alive, she was a prostitute and a murderer before she was murdered by her lover. Her story is the first we receive of how giving in to sexual desires leads to death and eternal unrest. Raymond expects to find Agnes&#x27;s beautiful, virgin face beneath the veil, but instead finds death. Her unveiling connects the loss of virginity and the giving in to sexual desires with death and punishment. Both the Bleeding Nun and Ambrosio begin pious, but then fall prey to their sexual desires. Ambrosio has already given into his desire for Matilda and the story of the Bleeding Nun told in the subplot foreshadows his further downfall with Antonia and his eternal punishment in the hands of the devil.

=== The reality of the supernatural ===

The Bleeding Nun also introduces the world of the supernatural into &quot;The Monk&quot;. The supernatural something &quot;that is above nature or belonging to a higher realm or system than that of nature&quot;. This introduction brings another Gothic element into the book. Up until this point, the plot has relied on natural elements of the sublime to invoke the terror expected of a Gothic novel. The entrance of the Bleeding Nun transforms this natural world into a world where the supernatural is possible. When she gets into Raymond&#x27;s carriage, &quot;Immediately thick clouds obscured the sky: The winds howled around us, the lightning flashed, and the Thunder roared tremendously&quot;. Nature is acknowledging the presence of a supernatural force.

When Agnes tells Raymond the story of how the Bleeding Nun&#x27;s ghost haunts the Castle of Lindenberg, Raymond asks her whether she believes the story and she replies &quot;How can you ask such a question? No, no, Alphonso! I have too much reason to lament superstition’s influence to be its Victim myself&quot;. It is not until the Bleeding Nun appears to Raymond at night that the idea of the existence of the supernatural begins to be a reality. The Wandering Jew&#x27;s appearance coincides with this first instance of the supernatural. He can see the Bleeding Nun, proving that she is not a figment of Raymond&#x27;s imagination. His supernatural abilities give access to the Bleeding Nun&#x27;s story and provide plausibility to the existence of the supernatural. He also has the power to free Raymond from her presence. The later confirmation of Raymond&#x27;s uncle to the existence of the Wandering Jew allows the whole story to be taken for fact. This establishes the reality of the supernatural and lays the groundwork for Matilda&#x27;s later use of magic and her and Ambrosio&#x27;s interaction with evil spirits.

Characteristics of the French Revolution

It is unclear which side Lewis stood on when it came to the French Revolution; however, one thing is sure: he was influenced by it, as seen in his work. For example, Ambrosio is a devout Monk who believes he is incapable of human error and finds himself a prisoner by the lustful desires of his heart. Still, the willpower he exemplifies to repress his desires represents the problems during the French Revolution—a struggle for freedom and oppression. Ronald Paulson writes that Ambrosio&#x27;s desire for sexual freedom results in the restraint of others&#x27; liberties. &quot;&quot;The Monk&quot; was kept in the monastery for so long that when he finally had the opportunity for self-liberation, it cost him his sacred vows of celibacy.&quot; In addition, the angry mob murders the nuns for falling into sexual sins, which is the same act that Ambrosio is guilty of; Ronald believes Ambrosio is justified for his actions due to being held captive for so many years. There is a resemblance to the unrest of the French Revolution when the angry mobs murdered the Nuns of St. Clare&#x27;s. Matthew Lewis uses Gothic fiction to play a role in &quot;The Monk&quot; by reliving the terror, surprise, and horror of the French Revolution through the lives of his characters.

Equally important, author Daniel Watkins views &quot;The Monk&quot; as significant to social hierarchy and thinks we should consider the importance of social classes and their violations throughout the novel. Ambrosio&#x27;s problem with sexuality is not simply an issue of moral conduct but one of political rights. For example, he discusses how &quot;Matilda denies social and patriarchal claims without mentioning class, and even though Ambrosio is attracted to Matilda, he seeks to preserve his sexual purity because of the high standard of class that he represents.&quot; Therefore, Matthew Lewis doesn&#x27;t use Ambrosio&#x27;s sexuality in the novel to lead the reader to focus on his moral degradation but on the values that have been instilled in him since birth. Ambrosio has entangled himself in a class ranking system, and failing to adhere to its rules results in social collapse. The social hierarchy portrayed in Matthew Lewis&#x27;s novel is significant to the French Revolution due to its social perception of the characters. During the 1700s, the Kingdom of France established the Ancien Régime, a term for social and political structure also known as the &quot;Third Estate,&quot; which was made up of the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. In &quot;The Monk&quot;, we see this system of class relations. Lorenzo is a wealthy nobleman, Ambrosio is the clergy, and Antonia is the peasant. During the French Revolution and in the novel, each class of society was expected to behave in a certain way and live up to the standards of their rank.

Matthew Lewis published &quot;The Monk&quot; when the French Revolution was associated with horror and terror. Łowczanin states that &quot;Lewis wrote &quot;The Monk&quot; in response to the horrors that revolved around the war, which are seen in how he characterizes women in the novel. The novel&#x27;s atmosphere focuses on the political upheavals of the anxieties of the time.&quot; He speaks about how the Catholic church depicted females as always aiming to broadcast their beauty, especially the Virgin Mary and other saints, and how the novel sought to expose Catholicism by relying on the images of women. To add, the Church and the Revolution used the female body as a display of degradation. On one hand, the female is a representation of beauty and, on the other, is abused at the time of revolt. For example, the once elegant and beautiful Prioress is described in Chapter 10 as beaten, shapeless, and disgusting—one whose lifeless body was dragged through the streets of Madrid. As Edmund Burke&#x27;s Reflections on the French Revolution (1790) writes, &quot;Lewis represents the female body as beautified and mutilated.&quot; Łowczanin thinks the horrors of the time affected the artistic imagination of many authors, leading them to channel their fears through their writings. Gothic is used metaphorically rather than literally because many writers sought coping mechanisms for what happened in the 1790s.

==Adaptations==
While not a direct adaptation E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s 1815 novel &quot;Die Elixiere des Teufels (The Devil&#x27;s Elixirs)&quot; is based on the basic idea of &quot;The Monk&quot; and draws heavily from its themes of the corruption of a monk of unknown descent, who is celebrated for his sermons, his involvement in an incestuous affair and temptation by the devil. Lewis&#x27; work is also mentioned at one point by a character, who talks about having read it.

&quot;La nonne sanglante&quot;, a 5-act play by Auguste Anicet-Bourgeois and Julien de Mallian, which premiered on 16 February 1835 in Paris at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, was very popular in its day. The legendary actress Mlle Georges created the role of Marie de Rudenz. The melodrama derives its title and certain images and motifs from &quot;The Monk&quot;.

&quot;Maria de Rudenz&quot; is a tragic opera by Gaetano Donizetti (1797–1848). The libretto by Salvadore Cammarano is based on a 5-act French play (1835), &quot;La nonne sanglante&quot;, by Auguste Anicet-Bourgeois and Julien de Mallian, a drama informed by motifs and imagery from &quot;The Monk&quot;. The opera premiered at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice, 30 January 1838, with soprano Carolina Ungher (1803–1877) singing the eponymous role.

&quot;La nonne sanglante&quot; (The Bloody Nun), freely based on &quot;The Monk&quot;, is a five-act opera by Charles Gounod to a libretto by Eugène Scribe and Germain Delavigne. Written between 1852 and 1854, it was first produced on 18 October 1854 at the Salle Le Peletier by the Paris Opéra. Soprano Anne Poinsot created the role of Agnès.

Edward Loder used the work as the basis for his 1855 opera &quot;Raymond and Agnes&quot;.

The French writer Antonin Artaud&#x27;s only full-length novel bears the same name and is a &quot;loose translation&quot; of Lewis&#x27;s work.

Luis Buñuel and Jean-Claude Carrière attempted to film a version of &quot;The Monk&quot; in the 1960s, but the project was halted due to lack of funds. Buñuel&#x27;s friend, the Greek director Ado Kyrou, used this script as the basis for his 1972 film version. &quot;Le Moine&quot; (English &quot;The Monk&quot;) boasted an international cast with Franco Nero in the title role. The film also starred Nathalie Delon, Eliana de Santis, Nadja Tiller and Nicol Williamson.

Juan Tovar, Mexican author, wrote a theatrical adaptation &quot;El Monje&quot; in 1986. It was originally planned as an interlude to his work &quot;The manuscript found in Saragossa&quot; (adaptation of the novel of the same name by Jan Potocki).

In 1990 &quot;The Monk&quot; was produced by Celtic Films. It starred Paul McGann as the title character, and was written and directed by Francisco Lara Polop.

Grant Morrison and Klaus Janson&#x27;s 1990 DC Comics graphic novel &quot;&quot; relies heavily and overtly upon &quot;The Monk&quot;, combined with elements of Don Giovanni, as the inspiration for the plot.

A film adaption, &quot;The Monk&quot;, was made by French-German director Dominik Moll in 2011. It was shot in Santes Creus, Girona and Madrid and stars Vincent Cassel, Déborah François, Geraldine Chaplin, and Sergi López. Shooting was scheduled for 12 weeks in April 2010. The film released in France on 13 July 2011, and in the UK on 27 April 2012.

A stage adaptation by Benji Sperring for Tarquin Productions ran at Baron&#x27;s Court Theatre, London, from 16 October to 3 November 2012.

One of the three fictional films shown in the 2022 video game &quot;Immortality&quot; is an adaptation of the novel, called &quot;Ambrosio.&quot;

<doc id="386868" wikidata="Q1637847" url="?curid=386868" title="Hungry ghost">
<text>Hungry ghost is a term in Buddhism and Chinese traditional religion, representing beings who are driven by intense emotional needs in an animalistic way.
The terms literally &quot;hungry ghost&quot;, are the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit term &quot;preta&quot; in Buddhism.
&quot;Hungry ghosts&quot; play a role in Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, and in Chinese folk religion.
The term is not to be confused with the generic term for &quot;ghost&quot; or damnation, (i.e. the residual spirit of a deceased ancestor). The understanding is that people first become a regular ghost when they die and then slowly weaken and eventually die a second time. The hungry ghosts, along with animals and hell beings, consists of the three realms of existence no one desires. In these realms it is extremely difficult to be reborn in a better realm (i.e. the realm of humans, asura or deva) because it is nearly impossible to perform deeds that cultivate good karma.

With the rise in popularity of Buddhism, the idea that souls would live in space until reincarnation became popular. In the Taoist tradition, it is believed that hungry ghosts can arise from people whose deaths have been violent or unhappy. Both Buddhism and Taoism share the idea that hungry ghosts can emerge from neglect or desertion of ancestors. According to the Hua-yen Sutra evil deeds will cause a soul to be reborn in one of six different realms. The highest degree of evil deed will cause a soul to be reborn as a denizen of hell, a lower degree of evil will cause a soul to be reborn as an animal, and the lowest degree will cause a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost. According to the tradition, evil deeds that lead to becoming a hungry ghost are killing, stealing and sexual misconduct. Desire, greed, anger and ignorance are all factors in causing a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost because they are motives for people to perform evil deeds. The biggest factor is greed as hungry ghosts are ever discontent and anguished because they are unable to satify their feelings of greed.

Some traditions imagine hungry ghosts living inside the bowels of earth or they live in the midst of humans but go unnoticed by those around them or they choose to distance themselves.

== Myths of origin ==
There are many legends regarding the origin of hungry ghosts. It is likely that the idea of hungry ghosts originated from ancient Indian culture, where they were referred to as Preta.

In the Buddhist tradition, hungry ghosts appear in stories from the &quot;Chuan-chi po-yuan ching&quot; (&quot;Sutra of One Hundred Selected Legends&quot;) that is from the early third century. Some examples of these stories are as follows:

Once, a rich man who travelled was selling sugar-cane juice. One day, a monk came to his house in search of some juice to cure an illness. The man had to leave, so he instructed his wife to give the monk the drink in his absence. Instead of doing this, she secretly urinated in the monk&#x27;s bowl, added sugar cane juice to it and gave it to the monk. The monk was not deceived; he poured out the bowl and left. When the wife died, she was reborn as a hungry ghost.

Another such tale is of a man who was giving and kind. One day, he was about to leave his house when a monk came by begging. The man instructed his wife to give the monk some food. After the man left his house, his wife was overcome with greed. She took it upon herself to teach the monk a lesson, so she locked the monk in an empty room all day with no food. She was reborn as a hungry ghost for innumerable lifetimes.

The legends often speak of hungry ghosts who, in a previous lifetime, were greedy women who refused to give away food. Other stories in the Buddhist tradition come from the &quot;Sutra on Ghosts Questioning Maudgalyāyana&quot; 鬼問目連經 (&quot;Gui wen Mulian jing&quot;). One of the stories tells of a diviner who constantly misled people due to his own avarice, and thus, he was reborn as a hungry ghost. Another story in &quot;The Legend of Mu-lien Entering the City and Seeing Five Hundred Hungry Ghosts&quot; is about five hundred men that were sons of elders of the city they lived in. When monks came begging to the city for food, the sons denied them because they thought the monks would keep coming back and eventually take all their food. After the sons died, they were reborn as hungry ghosts.

=== Avadānaśataka &quot;One Hundred Stories&quot; ===
The &quot;Avadānaśataka&quot; is one of the earliest collections of stories about hungry ghosts and was compiled by a Buddhist monk from northwest India between the second and fourth centuries CE. The stories in this work may have functioned as a prescription for appropriate behaviour. The text is divided into ten &quot;decades&quot;, the fifth decade being stories that concern hungry ghosts. This part of the &quot;Avadānaśataka&quot; recounts the bad thoughts and behavior the hungry ghosts have cultivated in their human existence which led them to the hungry ghost realm. The accumulation of malignancy or meanness is called &quot;mātsarya.&quot;

The notion of &quot;mātsarya&quot; in this volume is explained to understand the logic of mātsarya&#x27;s development, the actions it envokes, the suffering it causes and in which ways it can be eradicated. Therefore, it describes the causal chain (&quot;pratītyasamutpāda&quot;) that leads to the existence of a hungry ghost. At the end of nearly every story the phrase &quot;Work hard to get rid of your &quot;mātsarya&quot;!&quot; is repeated.

== In China ==
In Chinese Buddhism, The World of the Hungry Ghosts (鬼法界, 鬼界) is one of the six domains of the desire realm of Buddhism. The oral tradition of Chinese ancestral worship believes that the ghosts of the ancestors may be granted permission to return to the world of the living at a certain time of the year. If the spirits are hungry and not given sufficient offerings by their living relatives, they take what they can from the world.

A festival called the Hungry Ghost Festival ( is held to honor the hungry ancestor ghosts and food and drink is put out to satisfy their needs. The Hungry Ghost Festival is celebrated during the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. It also falls at the same time as a full moon, the new season, the fall harvest, the peak of monastic asceticism, the rebirth of ancestors, and the assembly of the local community. According to tradition, during this month, the gates of hell are opened up and the hungry ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment. These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who have forgotten to pay tribute to them after they died. They have long thin necks because they have not been fed by their families. Tradition states that families should offer prayers to their deceased relatives and burn &quot;hell money&quot;. It is believed that &quot;hell money&quot; is a valid currency in the underworld and helps ghosts to live comfortably in the afterlife. People also burn other forms of joss paper such as paper houses, cars and televisions to please the ghosts. This festival is one of numerous tantric practices from Chinese Esoteric Buddhism preserved in modern Chinese Buddhism after the various Buddhist traditions started to merge in the early modern period.

Families also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune. A big feast is held for the ghosts on the 15th day of the seventh month, where people bring samples of food and place them on the offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. Live shows are also put on and everyone is invited to attend. The first row of seats is always empty as this is where the ghosts are supposed to sit to better enjoy the live entertainment. The shows are always put on at night and at high volumes, so that the sound attracts and pleases the ghosts. These acts were better known as &quot;Merry-making&quot;.

The chief Taoist priest of the town wears an ornate crown of five gold and red panels, a practice borrowed from Buddhism. This represented the five most powerful deities (The Jade Emperor, Lord Guan, Tu Di Gong, Mazu and Xi Wangmu). He is believed to become their voice on earth.

A sacrificial altar and a chair are built for a priest either at a street entrance or in front of the village. The Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha sits in front of the chair. Under the chair are plates of rice flour and peaches. Sitting on the altar are three spirit tablets and three funeral banners. After noon, sheep, pigs, chicken, fruits, and cakes are donated by families that are displayed on the altar. A priest will put a triangular paper banner of three colors with special characters on every sacrifice. After the music begins to play, the priest hits the bell to call the hungry ghosts back to the table. He then throws the rice and peaches into the air in all directions to distribute them to the ghosts.

During the evening, incense is burnt in front of the doors of households. Incense stands for prosperity, the more incense burnt, the greater one&#x27;s prosperity. During the festival, shops are closed to leave the streets open for the ghosts. In the middle of each street stands an altar of incense with fresh fruit and sacrifices displayed on it. Behind the altar, monks will sing songs that it is believed only the ghosts can understand. This rite is called &quot;shi ge&#x27;r&quot;, meaning &quot;singing ghost songs&quot;.

Fifteen days after the feast, to make sure all the hungry ghosts find their way back to hell, people float lanterns on water and set them outside their houses. These lanterns are made by setting a lotus flower-shaped lantern on a piece of board. Hungry ghosts are believed to have found their way back when the lanterns go out.

There are many folk beliefs and taboos surrounding the Hungry Ghost Festival. Spirits are thought to be dangerous, and can take many forms, including snakes, moths, birds, foxes, wolves, and tigers. Some can even use the guise of a beautiful man or woman to seduce and possess. One story refers to a ghost which takes the form of a pretty girl and seduces a young man until a priest intervenes and sends the spirit back to hell. It is believed that possession can cause illness and/or mental disorders.

During the seventh month of the Chinese calendar, children are advised (usually by an elder in the family) to be home before dark, and not to wander the streets at night for fear a ghost might possess them. Swimming is thought to be dangerous as well, as spirits are believed to have drowned people. People will generally avoid driving at night, for fear of a &quot;collision&quot;, or spiritual offence, which is any event leading to illness or misfortune. While &quot;ghost&quot; is a commonly used term throughout the year, many people use the phrase &quot;backdoor god&quot; or &quot;good brother&quot; instead during the 7th month, so as not to anger the ghosts. Another thing to avoid is sampling any of the food placed on the offering table, as doing this can result in &quot;mysterious illness&quot;. Any person attending a show at indoor entertainment venues (&quot;getai&quot;) will notice the first row of chairs is left empty. These seats are reserved for the spirits, and it is considered bad form to sit in them. After an offering has been burnt for the spirits, stepping on or near the burnt area should be avoided, as it is considered an &quot;opening&quot; to the spirit world and touching it may cause the person to be possessed.

The English term has often been used metaphorically to describe the insatiable craving of an addict.

==In Tibet==
In Tibetan Buddhism, Hungry Ghosts (Tib. ཡི་དྭགས་, Wyl. &quot;yi dwags&quot;, Sanskrit: &quot;preta&quot;) have their own realm depicted on the Bhavacakra and are represented as teardrop or paisley-shaped with bloated stomachs and necks too thin to pass food so that attempting to eat is also incredibly painful. Some are described as having &quot;mouths the size of a needle&#x27;s eye and a stomach the size of a mountain&quot;. This is a metaphor for people futilely attempting to fulfill their illusory physical desires.

According to the History of Buddhism, as elements of Chinese Buddhism entered a dialogue with Indian Buddhism in the Tibetan Plateau, this synthesis is evident in the compassion rendered in the form of blessed remains of food, etc., offered to the &quot;pretas&quot; in rites such as Ganachakra. 

In Mahayana Buddhism Chenrezig offers the hungry ghosts the nectar flowing from his fingers that relieves their suffering. This buddha helps the hungry ghosts as he is the manifestation of the Lotus Family that has the special ability to support those who suffer, in this case the hungry ghost realm that is filled with suffering. This nectar symbolises purification which is able to cleanse all negativities, karma, obscurations, and defilements.

== In Japan ==

In Japanese Buddhism, the Hungry Ghosts are considered to have two variants: the gaki and the jikininki. Gaki (餓鬼) are the spirits of jealous or greedy people who, as punishment for their mortal vices, have been cursed with an insatiable hunger for a particular substance or object. Traditionally, this is something repugnant or humiliating, such as human corpses or feces, though in more recent legends, it may be virtually anything, no matter how bizarre. Jikininki (食人鬼 &quot;people-eating ghosts&quot;) are the spirits of greedy, selfish or impious individuals who are cursed after death to seek out and eat human corpses. They do this at night, scavenging for newly dead bodies and food offerings left for the dead. They sometimes also loot the corpses they eat for valuables. Nevertheless, jikininki lament their condition and hate their repugnant cravings for dead human flesh. 

The Hungry Ghosts Scroll kept at the Kyoto National Museum depicts the world of the hungry ghosts and the suffering of these creatures, and contains tales of salvation of the ghosts. The whole scroll has been designated as National Treasure of Japan and it was possibly part of a set of scrolls depicting the six realms which was kept at Sanjūsangen-dō.

LaFleur comments that these depictions symbolise that hungry ghosts are not just hungry but they are constituted by their very hunger. Unlike mankind&#x27;s hunger that comes and goes for hungry ghosts &quot;there is only an ongoing, alleviated gnawing of the stomach and parching of the throat.&quot; The body of the hungry ghost is important as it has a huge stomach and a throat as narrow as a needle which leaves the hungry ghost in the dilemma of always having appetite but no way to ever satisfy that hunger. The hungry ghost depicted in art in medieval Japan were thought of as &quot;consumer of fires&quot; because they mistook fire for something edible in their constant strive to satisfy their hunger. This only makes their hunger worse, they start to emit fire from their mouths and start to consume even more fire. LaFleur interprets that the art of hungry ghosts might have provided viewers of a look into the world they inhabit and which they normally do not see clearly. Therefore, the images might offer the insights that hungry ghosts interact with the world of humans from their world and that the human realm is oblivious to these beings affecting them.

== Types of spirits ==
It is believed that the soul contains elements of both yin and yang. The yin is the &quot;gui&quot;, or demon part, and the yang is the &quot;shen&quot;, or spirit part. When death occurs, the &quot;gui&quot; should return to earth, and the &quot;shen&quot; to the grave or family shrine. If a ghost is neglected, it will become a &quot;gui&quot;. The &quot;shen&quot;, or ancestral spirit, watches over its descendants, and can bring good fortune if properly worshipped.

Hungry ghosts are different from the ghosts of Chinese which all people are believed to become after death.

According to the Nyāyānusāriṇī, there are three main groups of hungry ghosts, each of which are divided into three sub-groups:
*ghosts of no wealth (無財鬼)
** torch or flaming mouths (炬口鬼): These ghosts regurgitate fierce flames with mouths of inextinguishable embers. Their bodies are like that of a palmyra tree. This is the karmic result of stinginess.
** needle mouths (針口鬼): These ghosts have bellies as vast as mountain valleys. Their mouth are like the hole of a needle. Even if they find food or drink, they cannot consume it. Thus they suffer from hunger and thirst.
** putrid mouths (臭口鬼): These ghosts give off a great decomposing odor from their mouths. They may be found at privies overflowing with filth and fecal matter. They constantly emit a nauseating, evil fumes. Although they find food, they cannot eat it. This fills them with anger and they run about shrieking.
*ghosts of little wealth (少財鬼)
** needle hair (針毛鬼): These ghosts have bodies made of hair, firm like spears. They are unapproachable. Their insides burn, as a deer shot with a poison arrow. They run about suffering from ulcers. Only small quantities of impure food can allay their hunger. 
** putrid hair (臭毛鬼): These ghosts also have bodies made of hair that smells incredibly foul. Their flesh and bones emit noxious fumes and their bowels are full of grime. They are agitated from poison in their throats and their skin splits when their hair is pulled out. Only small quantities of impure food can allay their hunger.
** swollen (癭鬼): Large protuberances grow in their throats. They suffer from aches and fever. They smell of pus that gushes forth from their bodies. They fight with each other over food. They consume small bits of pus and blood and can be somewhat satiated. 
*ghosts of much wealth (多財鬼)
**ghosts of sacrifices (希祠鬼): These ghosts live off sacrifices offered by humans. One is reborn here by ethically gathering wealth, but with a stingy heart does not practice generosity. If one is reborn here, their descendants can make offerings to satiate their hunger. 
**ghosts of losses (希棄鬼): These ghosts are always covetous, searching out filth like vomit and feces to eat. In life, they sought out and found enjoyment in both clean and unclean things, and were thus reborn here.
**ghosts of great power (大勢鬼): includes certain &quot;yakshas&quot;, &quot;rakshasas&quot;, &quot;kumbhandas&quot; and the like who are the powerful rulers of the spirits. They reside in forests, stupas, mountain valleys, and empty palaces. Those with no authoritative power live on all four continents except for Uttarakuru. Those with authoritative power may also be found in the heavens and on two of the five-hundred islands that lie to the west of Jambudvipa. One island holds their castle while the other holds the castle of those ghosts with no authority.
Sixteen hungry ghosts are said to live in hell or in a region of hell. Unlike other hell dwellers, they can leave hell and wander. They look through garbage and human waste on the outskirts of human cities. They are said to be invisible during the daylight hours but visible at night. Some hungry ghosts can only eat corpses, or their food is burnt up in their mouths, sometimes they have a big belly and a neck as thin as a needle (this image is the basic one for hungry ghosts in Asian Buddhism).

According to the &quot;Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra&quot;, there are thirty-six different types of hungry ghost.

== Interpretation ==

=== Depiction ===
The depictions and stories about hungry ghosts especially in the early Indian context can show the viewer a commentary about the &quot;manual scavengers&quot;, members of the lowest caste in India. They are regarded as people whose bad stigma comes from their birth and the group they belong to. They represent a group of starving people who are wandering the outside of cities, are homeless and hungry. As most people have adopted an ingrained blindness to this underclass.

Furthermore, the bodies of hungry ghosts bear similarities with humans who are deprived of food. This malnourishment causes a disorder known as &quot;kwashiorkor&quot; that encompasses symptoms like stomach bloating from fluid retention, hair and tooth loss and dry and cracked skin. These people have skeletal like figures and big stomachs.

Looking at these hungry ghosts and their figure one might interpret hungry ghosts as teachers. They do not teach the causes of karma like solitary buddhas, however, instead of words with their bodies. Their whole body embodies suffering (&quot;dukkha&quot;) to such an extend that seeing them gives the viewer the chance to witness the truth of &quot;dukkha&quot;.

=== The Body of the Hungry Ghost as Hell ===
The realm of the hungry ghosts is just one above that of the beings in naraka, however, while the hungry ghosts are not directly in hell their body is constituted by a hunger that they cannot satisfy due to the nature of their bodies, having big bellies and the throat of a needle. Whereas the hell have walls that keep the beings in a permanent state of torture, the body of the hungry ghosts is like a hell because they cannot escape their bodies, free to wander the world at will.

=== In Buddhist Philosophy ===
The influential Indian monk Vasubandhu used hungry ghosts in his argumentation of the Yogācāra concept that &quot;everything in the three realms is nothing but appearance.&quot; He argues against the objective reality of external objects (physical and non-physical) by asserting that the appearance of external objects is mind-dependent, as they happen to be different at specific times and places across different minds. Since different minds encounter the same objects differently, similar to dreams, these objects do not need to have a physical reality. 

The author offers an example about a river perceived as clear by humans, but full of pus by hungry ghosts. Thus, the appearances of external objects across different minds is distinct. By that, the author establishes an argument for a lack of substantial reality among external objects.

== In Popular Culture ==

丁寧な暮らしをする餓鬼 (&quot;The Hungry Ghost who leads a polite life&quot;): This three volume work explores the life of an hungry ghost who, unlike others of their kind, is very compassionate and pure-hearted. They spend half a day grinding coffee beans in a mortar, folding plastic bags into triangles, sweeping up leaves, and so on.

<doc id="386873" wikidata="Q3058383" url="?curid=386873" title="Espanola, Ontario">
<text>Espanola (2021 population census 5,185) is a town in Northern Ontario, Canada, in the Sudbury District. It is situated on the Spanish River, approximately west of downtown Sudbury, and just south of the junction of Highway 6 and Highway 17.

The town is where the first experimental rules for the sport of ringette were created in 1963 by Mirl Arthur &quot;Red&quot; McCarthy using a group of local high school girls. Today, Espanola is considered &quot;The Home of Ringette&quot; while North Bay, Ontario, is considered &quot;The Birthplace of Ringette&quot; though the title is often shared by both.

== History ==
===Origin===
The name &quot;Espanola&quot; has been attributed to a story which dates back to the mid-18th century. The story goes that a First Nations Ojibwa tribe met a man who had travelled far from Spain. The Spanish man, named Frise Espagnol, married a local Anishinaabe (First Nations) of a family living near the mouth of the river and he taught her and their children to speak Spanish. Later, when the French voyageurs and coureurs des bois came upon the settlement and heard fragments of Spanish spoken by the local natives, they remarked &quot;Espagnole&quot;, which had been later anglicized to &quot;Espanola&quot;, and the river was named the Spanish River.

===Company town===
The town of Espanola was sited next to a waterfall on the Spanish River, which was sometimes called Webbwood Falls. Before the existence of the town, a hydropower dam was constructed at the falls to power the pulp and paper mill of the Spanish River Pulp and Paper Company, a subsidiary of the Mead Corporation. A company town, Espanola, was also established for the mill&#x27;s workers and their families. The town expanded quickly and was soon a bustling centre with a hotel, school and theatre.

On January 21, 1910, a Canadian Pacific Railway passenger train derailed off a trestle east of Espanola. Forty-three people died from the railcar&#x27;s plunge into the icy water of the Spanish River. It was one of the CPR&#x27;s worst railway accidents.

In 1927, Abitibi Power and Paper Company acquired the Spanish River Pulp and Paper Mills from Mead, in a transaction that was subsequently seen to be highly overvalued and having a conflict of interest that was ultimately detrimental to Abitibi&#x27;s shareholders. Changing economic conditions brought on by the Great Depression forced the closure of the Spanish River facility in 1929.

Espanola became a ghost town until the Second World War, when the mill site became a camp for German prisoners of war. During the final years of the Hepburn government, it sought to stimulate employment in Northern Ontario in order to stabilize its political position. In that regard, it encouraged negotiations between Abitibi and the Kalamazoo Vegetable Parchment Company of Parchment, Michigan, which resulted in the sale of Abitibi&#x27;s Spanish River facility (at that time its largest non-economic asset) in 1943. It subsequently resumed operation as the KVP Company, producing specialty kraft paper.

In 1948, KVP was sued for nuisance in allowing noxious effluent to be discharged into the Spanish River, and an injunction was issued barring it from making any further discharge. The order was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada without success. In 1950, the injunction was dissolved by an Act of the provincial legislature, which provided for any subsequent disputes with KVP to be taken to arbitration, which, together with other legislative changes, effectively curtailed chances for any further injunctions to be issued. The 1950 Act was not repealed until 2006.

The 1950 Act effectively gave KVP a limited licence to pollute, and serious cleanup efforts did not happen until the 1980s.

In 1966 KVP was bought by Brown Forest Industries, a division of Charles Bluhdorn&#x27;s industrial conglomerate Gulf and Western Industries. The Brown Forest Industries operation was later sold to E.B. Eddy, who operated the mill until June 1998. As of 2023, the plant was owned by Domtar, and at the time was the town&#x27;s largest employer. In September 2023, Domtar announced that it intended to shut down the mill.

Espanola got some negative press in the early 1980s when the mill accidentally discharged toxic effluent into the Spanish River, killing fish by the thousands. The spill acted like a flush, and when the fish came back a few years later, they were reportedly untainted and thriving, although the toxic smell still remained. Now the mill is said to be one of the most stringent &quot;zero-emissions&quot; pulp bleaching processes in the world , and the area below the Spanish River Dam is a designated fish sanctuary.

===Recent history===
Espanola was officially incorporated as a town on March 1, 1958.

The 1969 CBC Television series &quot;Adventures in Rainbow Country&quot; was filmed near Espanola, near the small First Nations community of Birch Island and at Whitefish Falls. The series starred Lois Maxwell, the actress who played &quot;Miss Moneypenny&quot; in Bond films such as &quot;Dr. No&quot; and &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. Canadian-born, she was a long-time resident of the town.

In 2001, a group of volunteers staged a fundraiser for the local hospital by attempting to set a world record for the world&#x27;s longest ice hockey game. They were successful, playing for over three days straight. The record was broken in April 2004 in nearby Sudbury, where the teams played for six hours longer. Currently, the record holders are team Hope and team Cure from Sherwood Park near Edmonton, Alberta, who played for 250 hours (10 days).

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Espanola had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As of the 2016 census, Espanola is ethnically 87% European, 11.5% Indigenous, and 1.5% Visible Minority (mostly Chinese and South Asian).


==Transportation==
===Road===
 is routed through Espanola, with its junction with just to the north, across the Spanish River in Baldwin township near McKerrow. It also connects Espanola with communities to the south along the way to Manitoulin Island, reaching its land terminus at South Baymouth before continuing on the other side of Lake Huron starting at Tobermory and passing through a number of Southern Ontario communities before reaching its ultimate southern terminus of Port Dover.

===Rail===
Historically, Espanola was a station stop along the Algoma Eastern Railway (AER) and featured a distinctive station and water tower (built in 1911) which were similar to other AER stations such as the one in McKerrow. It marked the first major stop after the AER line turned south toward Manitoulin Island and its ultimate terminus at Little Current. After the financially troubled AER was acquired by the CPR, the portion of the line continuing south from the junction at McKerrow was maintained as the CPR Little Current Subdivision and saw regular passenger traffic, especially due to the difficulties in crossing the Spanish River before a modern highway bridge was constructed in the 1960s. In 1943, the Espanola station was served by a single southbound and single northbound passenger train per day, with a travel time of just over two hours to Sudbury. The approximately 50-year-old water tower was demolished in 1960 as a part of the CPR&#x27;s final switch from steam to diesel trains. In 1963, passenger service along the spur line was discontinued, though passengers were still able to board CP&#x27;s iconic Budd cars at the Webbwood and McKerrow stations until service along the Sault Ste. Marie line was also discontinued in 1976, cutting off Espanola&#x27;s access to passenger rail for the first time in its history. The historic Algoma Eastern Railway station was demolished shortly after in the mid-1980s.

===Bus===
In 2018, Ontario Northland announced a major service expansion west of Sudbury, which included Espanola. Passengers may board buses headed to Sault Ste. Marie, or Sudbury.

===Walking and cycling===
A segment of the Great Lakes Waterfront Trail runs through Espanola. It approaches the town from the direction of the rural area of Lee Valley to the west. In downtown Espanola, the trail forks, with one section going to the north, where it bypasses McKerrow to the south on the way to Nairn and Sudbury, and the other going south toward Manitoulin, where it eventually connects to the Bruce Trail via ferry to the Bruce Peninsula. Both directions partially follow a paved shoulder along , as well as on-street and off-street sections around the town.

== Public services ==
Espanola&#x27;s three primary schools, A.B. Ellis Public School, Sacred Heart School (Roman Catholic), and École St. Joseph (French Roman Catholic), and two secondary schools, Espanola High School and École secondaire catholique Franco-Ouest, service the local students, as well as those from surrounding communities such as Massey, Webbwood, McKerrow, Nairn Centre, Willisville, Whitefish Falls, Walford and Birch Island.

In 1999 a modern recreation complex was constructed, replacing the aging arena and community swimming pool. In addition, Espanola has a public library.

== Sports ==
===Ringette===
The town is where the first experimental rules for the Canadian sport of Ringette were drafted in 1963 at the Espanola Arena by Mirl Arthur &quot;Red&quot; McCarthy using a group of local high school girls who had played ice hockey during gym classes at the Espanola High School.

===Ice hockey===
Espanola has had four Junior A hockey teams throughout the town&#x27;s history. The first was the Espanola Screaming Eagles which were founded in 1962 in the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association and won the league title the same year. The team moved to the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey League in 1972 when the NOJHA disbanded and stayed there until 2003 when the team relocated to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan where they are now known as the Soo Eagles in the same league.

The town&#x27;s second team was the Espanola Kings which were founded in 2007 in the Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League. However, the team only lasted two season before folding after the 2008-2009 season.

The third team was the Espanola Rivermen which were founded in 2013 in the NOJHL. However, the team lasted one season in the league before relocating to the newly formed Canadian International Hockey League. The team folded in 2015 after the league disbanded after one season.

The fourth team is the Espanola Express which were founded in 2015 in the NOJHL. The team is still active in the league today.

<doc id="386875" wikidata="Q7295" url="?curid=386875" title="Egyptian Mau">
<text>The Egyptian Mau is a small to medium-sized, short to medium-haired cat breed. They are one of the few naturally spotted breeds of domesticated cat. The spots of the Mau occur on only the tips of the hairs of its coat. It is considered a rare breed.

==History==
===Origins===
Historical evidence points to the Mau being an Egyptian breed. The feline genome data published in the Pentascope document shows the Egyptian Mau to be very closely related to the Maine Coon, Korat, and American Turkish Angoras (indistinguishable from native Turkish Angoras). The phylogenetic tree published in PlosOne demonstrates that the Egyptian Mau belongs to the group of Western-derived breeds. The East Mediterranean/Anatolian group is omitted because breeds that supposedly originate in that geographic area do not do so.

In 1953 in Italy, Princess Natalie Trubetskoy saw a cat belonging to the Egyptian ambassador to Italy and after asking about the cat she persuaded him to help her obtain a cat from Cairo. She obtained a female named Baba who was later bred with the ambassador&#x27;s cat. A male bronze tabby was born and he was bred with his mother to produce a female named Lisa. These progenitors were first shown in 1955 at the Rome Cat Show. English fanciers attempted to reproduce this novel breed by using Abyssinians, Siamese, and tabby cats which became the Ocicat. Princess Natalie travelled with her three Maus to the United States in 1956 and in the following year Baba became a champion. The American Maus are purportedly from Baba although other reports claim they&#x27;re descended from a pair named Gepa and Ludol, brought into the country in 1953.

===Breed recognition===
The breed first received championship in 1968 with the Cat Fanciers Federation followed later on with recognition from the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association in 1977 and The International Cat Association in 1979. By the 1990s there were breeders in North America, Europe, and Japan. The Egyptian Mau did not reach British shores until 1998 when the first Maus were imported by Melissa Bateson, 8 years after it received full recognition from the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF).

==Popularity==
Egyptian Maus are a relatively rare breed worldwide. Fewer than 200 kittens are registered with the GCCF each year. In 2022, only 39 Mau kittens were registered at the GCCF, ranking the cat breed at position 27 out of 40 breeds in popularity. In 2018, the Egyptian Mau ranked at position 27 out of 45 cat breeds registered with the Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association (CFA).

The breed conformation is described as &quot;a balance between the compactness of a Burmese and the slim elegance of a Siamese. Its medium-length body is muscular, with the hind legs longer than the front, giving the Mau the appearance of standing on tiptoes when upright.&quot;

The Egyptian Mau is the fastest of the domestic cats, with its longer hind legs, and unique flap of skin extending from the flank to the back knee, which assists in running by allowing the legs to stretch back farther, providing for greater agility and length of stride. Maus have been clocked running more than .

The typical gestation period for a regular house cat is 64–67 days, but the Egyptian Mau has a longer gestation period, at 73 days.

==Appearance==
The Egyptian Mau is a muscular cat with notable features being their spotted coat and a tabby marking on their forehead that is said to resemble a scarab design. The head is gently rounded and of medium size. The ears are medium to moderately large, broad at the base with a bit of pointing at the tip. The hair on the ears is short and may have tufting. The eyes are round and large. The eyes are light green although kittens may have amber eyes. The body is of medium length with prominent shoulder blades. There is a loose flap of skin extending from the flank to the knee of the hind legs. The tail is of medium length and thick at the base.

===Coat===
The Egyptian Mau has a medium length coat with two or more bands of ticking.

====Coat colours====
Maus come in six colours. From most to least common, these colours are silver, bronze, smoke, black, caramel and blue/pewter.

====Coat patterns====

The Egyptian Mau&#x27;s coat contains dark patterns of varying size and shape, located all over the body and limbs. They also may have a stripe running down the lower spine and tail.

==Health==
The Egyptian Mau has a higher prevalence of urate urolithiasis (bladder stones) than mixed-breeds. A review of over 5,000 cases of urate uroliths had almost half the population of Egyptian Maus as having had the condition with an odds ratio of 44.41. A Canadian study of over 10,000 examinations of uroliths in cats found that 14 out of 17 Egyptian Maus surveyed had urate urolithiasis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmidhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC28574&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Alfred Eisenstaedt (December 6, 1898 – August 23, 1995) was a German-born American photographer and photojournalist. He began his career in Germany prior to World War II but achieved prominence as a staff photographer for &quot;Life&quot; magazine after moving to the U.S. &quot;Life&quot; featured more than 90 of his pictures on its covers, and more than 2,500 of his photo stories were published.

Among his most famous cover photographs was &quot;V-J Day in Times Square&quot;, taken during the V-J Day celebration in New York City, showing an American sailor kissing a nurse in a &quot;dancelike dip&quot; which &quot;summed up the euphoria many Americans felt as the war came to a close&quot;, in the words of his obituary. He was &quot;renowned for his ability to capture memorable images of important people in the news&quot; and for his candid photographs taken with a small 35mm Leica camera, typically with natural lighting.

== Early life ==
Eisenstaedt was born in Dirschau (Tczew) in West Prussia, Imperial Germany in 1898. His family was Jewish and moved to Berlin in 1906. Eisenstaedt was fascinated by photography from his youth and began taking pictures at age 11 when he was given his first camera, an Eastman Kodak Folding Camera with roll film. He later served in the German Army&#x27;s artillery during World War I and was wounded in 1918. While working as a belt and button salesman in the 1920s in Weimar Germany, Eisenstaedt began taking photographs as a freelancer for the Pacific and Atlantic Photos&#x27; Berlin office in 1928. The office was taken over by the Associated Press in 1931.

== Professional photographer ==

Eisenstaedt became a full-time photographer in 1929 when he was hired by the Associated Press office in Germany, and within a year he was described as a &quot;photographer extraordinaire.&quot; He also worked for &quot;Illustrierte Zeitung&quot;, published by Ullstein Verlag, then the world&#x27;s largest publishing house. Four years later he photographed the famous first meeting between Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini in Italy. Other notable early pictures by Eisenstaedt include his depiction of a waiter at the ice rink of the Grand Hotel in St. Moritz in 1932 and Joseph Goebbels at the League of Nations in Geneva in 1933. Although initially friendly, Goebbels scowled at Eisenstaedt when he took the photograph, after learning that Eisenstaedt was Jewish.

In 1935, Fascist Italy&#x27;s impending invasion of Ethiopia led to a burst of international interest in Ethiopia. While working for &quot;Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung&quot;, Alfred took over 3,500 photographs in Ethiopia, before emigrating to the United States, where he joined &quot;Life&quot; magazine, but returned in the following year to Ethiopia to continue his photography.

Eisenstaedt&#x27;s family was Jewish. Oppression in Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Germany caused them to emigrate to the U.S. They arrived in 1935 and settled in New York, where he subsequently became a naturalized citizen, and joined fellow Associated Press émigrés Leon Daniel and Celia Kutschuk in their PIX Publishing photo agency founded that year. The following year, 1936, &quot;Time&quot; founder Henry Luce bought &quot;Life&quot; magazine, and Eisenstaedt, already noted for his photography in Europe, was asked to join the new magazine as one of its original staff of four photographers, including Margaret Bourke-White and Robert Capa. He remained a staff photographer from 1936 to 1972, achieving notability for his photojournalism of news events and celebrities.

Along with entertainers and celebrities, he photographed politicians, philosophers, artists, industrialists, and authors during his career with &quot;Life&quot;. By 1972, he had photographed nearly 2,500 stories and had more than 90 of his photos on the cover. With &quot;Life&quot;&#x27;s circulation of two million readers, Eisenstaedt&#x27;s reputation increased substantially. According to one historian, &quot;his photographs have a power and a symbolic resonance that made him one of the best &quot;Life&quot; photographers.&quot; In subsequent years, he also worked for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; and others.

=== Style and technique ===
From his early years as professional photographer he became an enthusiast for small 35 mm film cameras, especially the Leica camera. Unlike most news photographers at the time who relied on much larger and less portable 4&quot;×5&quot; press cameras with flash attachments, Eisenstaedt preferred the smaller hand-held Leica, which gave him greater speed and more flexibility when shooting news events or capturing candids of people in action. His photos were also notable as a result of his typical use of natural light as opposed to relying on flash lighting. In 1944, &quot;Life&quot; described him as the &quot;dean of today&#x27;s miniature-camera experts.&quot;

At the time, this style of photojournalism, with a smaller camera with its ability to use available light, was then in its infancy. It also helped Eisenstaedt create a more relaxed atmosphere when photographing famous people where he was able to capture more natural poses and expressions: &quot;They don&#x27;t take me too seriously with my little camera,&quot; he stated. &quot;I don&#x27;t come as a photographer. I come as a friend.&quot; It was a style he learned from his 35 years in Europe, where he preferred making informal, unposed portraits, along with extended picture stories. As a result, &quot;Life&quot; began using more such photo stories, with the magazine becoming a recognized source of such photojournalism of the world&#x27;s luminaries. Of &quot;Life&#x27;s&quot; photographers, Eisenstaedt was most noted for his &quot;human interest&quot; photos and less the hard news images used by most news publications.

His success at establishing a relaxed setting for his subjects was not without difficulties, however, when he needed to capture the feeling he wanted. Anthony Eden, resistant to being photographed, called Eisenstaedt &quot;the gentle executioner.&quot; Similarly, Winston Churchill told him where to place the camera to get a good picture, and during a photo shoot of Ernest Hemingway in his boat, Hemingway, in a rage, tore his own shirt to shreds and threatened to throw Eisenstaedt overboard.

=== Martha&#x27;s Vineyard ===

Eisenstaedt, known as &quot;Eisie&quot; to his close friends, enjoyed his annual August vacations on the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard for 50 years. During these summers, he would conduct photographic experiments, working with different lenses, filters, and prisms in natural light. Eisenstaedt was fond of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard&#x27;s photogenic lighthouses and was the focus of lighthouse fundraisers organized by Vineyard Environmental Research Institute (VERI).

Two years before his death, Eisenstaedt photographed President Bill Clinton with wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea. The session took place at the Granary Gallery in West Tisbury on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and was documented by a photograph published in &quot;People&quot; magazine on September 13, 1993.

== Personal life ==
After first settling in New York City in 1935, Eisenstaedt lived in Jackson Heights, Queens (NYC) for the rest of his life. He met Kathy Kaye, a South African woman, and married her in 1949. The couple had no children and remained together until her death in 1972. Until shortly before Eisenstaedt&#x27;s death, he would walk daily from his home to his &quot;Life&quot; office on the Avenue of the Americas and 51st Street.

He died in August 1995 at age 96 at his Martha&#x27;s Vineyard vacation cottage named &quot;Pilot House&quot;, in the company of his sister-in-law, Lucille Kaye, and a photographer friend, William E. Marks.

He was buried at Mount Hebron Cemetery in Flushing, Queens.

== Notable Eisenstaedt photographs ==
* &quot;V-J day in Times Square&quot;
 Eisenstaedt&#x27;s most famous photograph is of an American sailor grabbing and kissing a stranger—a young woman—on August 14, 1945, in Times Square. He took this photograph using a Leica IIIa. (The photograph is known under various names: &quot;V-J Day in Times Square, V-Day,&quot; and others.) Because Eisenstaedt was photographing rapidly changing events during the V-J Day celebrations, he stated that he did not get a chance to obtain names and details, which has encouraged a number of mutually incompatible claims to the identities of the subjects. Their identities turned out to be George Mendonsa (1923–2019) and Edith Shane (1918–2009).

* &quot;Portraits of Sophia Loren&quot;
The portraits of Sophia Loren have been described by Marianne Fulton of The Digital Journalist as conveying mischievousness, dignity, and love on the part of both Eisenstaedt and Loren.
* &quot;Ice Skating Waiter, St. Moritz&quot;
This 1932 photograph depicts a waiter at the ice rink of the Grand Hotel. &quot;I did one smashing picture&quot;, Eisenstaedt wrote, &quot;of the skating headwaiter. To be sure the picture was sharp, I put a chair on the ice and asked the waiter to skate by it. I had a Miroflex camera and focused on the chair.&quot;
* &quot;Children at a Puppet Theatre, Paris&quot;
Eisenstaedt took this photo in 1963 at the Tuileries Garden. He later recalled in his self-portrait, &quot;It took a long time to get the angle I liked. There are some close-ups of the children that are good. But the best picture is the one I took at the climax of the action. It carries all the excitement of the children screaming, &#x27;The dragon is slain!&#x27; &quot;. The photo sold in Lot #91 at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2006 for an artist-record price of $55,200.

== Awards and recognition ==
* 1989: National Medal of Arts. Awarded by President George H. W. Bush in a ceremony on the White House lawn.
* 1999: The Digital Journalist chose Alfred Eisenstaedt as its &#x27;Photojournalist of the Century&#x27;. Dirck Halstead wrote, &quot;When it came to choosing the one photojournalist who had the most profound impact, and who leaves the greatest legacy, there was no question whom that person is – Alfred Eisenstaedt.&quot;
* 2020: Eisenstaedt was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

== Exhibitions ==
* &quot;Alfred Eisenstaedt: &#x27;Eisie&#x27; at 88,&quot; International Center of Photography, New York City, 1986. A retrospective.

== Alfred Eisenstaedt Awards for Magazine Photography ==

<text>Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi, China. Located in the north-central part of the province and in the hinterland of Poyang Lake Plain, it is bounded on the west by the Jiuling Mountains, and on the east by Poyang Lake. Because of its strategic location connecting the prosperous East and South China, it has become a major railway hub in Southern China in recent decades.

As the Nanchang Uprising in 1927 is distinctively recognized by the ruling Communist Party as &quot;firing the first gunshot against the Nationalists&quot;, the current government has therefore named the city since 1949 &quot;the place where the People&#x27;s Liberation Army was born&quot;, and the most widely known &quot;place where the military banner of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army was first raised&quot;.

Nanchang is also a major city, appearing among the top 100 cities in the world by scientific research outputs, as tracked by the Nature Index and home to Nanchang University.

==History==


=== Imperial era ===
The territories encompassing modern-day Jiangxi Province—including Nanchang—was first incorporated into China during the Qin dynasty, when it was conquered from the Baiyue peoples and organized as Jiujiang Commandery (). In 201 BC, during the Han dynasty, the city was given the Chinese name Nanchang and became the administrative seat of Yuzhang Commandery (), and was governed by Guan Ying, one of Emperor Gaozu of Han&#x27;s generals. The name Nanchang means &quot;southern flourishing&quot;, derived from a motto of developing what is now southern China that is traditionally attributed to Emperor Gaozu himself.

In AD 589, during the Sui dynasty, this commandery was changed into a prefecture named Hongzhou (), and after 763 it became the provincial center of Jiangxi, which was then beginning the rapid growth that by the 12th century made it the most populous province in China.

In 653 the Tengwang Pavilion was constructed, and in 675 Wang Bo wrote the classic &quot;Tengwang Ge Xu&quot;, a poetic introductory masterpiece celebrating the building, making the building, the city, and the author himself known to literate Chinese-speaking population ever since. The Pavilion has been destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout history. Its present form was reconstructed in the 1980s after being destroyed in 1929 during the Chinese Civil War.

In 959, under the Southern Tang regime, Nanchang was made superior prefecture and the southern capital. After the conquest by the Song regime in 981 it was reverted to the name Hongzhou. In 1164 it was renamed Longxing prefecture, which name it retained until 1368. During the Yuan dynasty it was the capital of Jiangxi Province, an area that included Guangdong as well. At the end of the Yuan (Mongol) period (1279–1368), it became a battleground between Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), and the rival local warlord, Chen Youliang. At the beginning of the 16th century it was the power base from which Zhu Chenhao, the Prince of Ning, launched a rebellion against the emperor.

During the Yuan Dynasty, it might have been the centre of porcelain trade.

During the reign of the Wanli Emperor of the Ming dynasty, it housed relatives of the emperor who had been exiled because they were potential claimants of the imperial throne, members of the imperial family constituting about one quarter of the city&#x27;s population; as a result of this, Matteo Ricci came here when trying to gain entry to Beijing.

In the 1850s it suffered considerably as a result of the Taiping Rebellion (1850–64), and its importance as a commercial centre declined as the overland routes to Canton were replaced by coastal steamship services in the latter half of the 19th century. Nanchang has, however, remained the undisputed regional metropolis of Jiangxi.

=== Republican era ===
On August 1, 1927, Nanchang was the site of one of a series of insurrections organized by the communists. The Nanchang Uprising, led by pro-communist Kuomintang officers under Soviet direction, succeeded in holding the city for only a few days, and provided a core of troops and a method of organization from which the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) later developed.

In 1939, the Battle of Nanchang, a ferocious battle between the Chinese National Revolutionary Army and the Imperial Japan Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War took place.

=== People&#x27;s Republic era ===
By 1949, Nanchang was still essentially an old-style administrative and commercial city, with little industry apart from food processing; it had a population of about 275,000. Nanchang first acquired a rail connection in 1915, only connecting to the port city of Jiujiang by the Yangtze. Several other rail links have since been opened. After World War II a line was completed to Linchuan and Gongqi in the Ru River Valley to the south-southeast.

Since 1949, Nanchang has been extensively industrialized. It is now a large-scale producer of cotton textiles and cotton yarn. Paper making is also a major industry, as is food processing (especially rice milling). Heavy industry began to gain prominence in the mid-1950s. A large thermal-power plant was installed and uses coal brought by rail from Fengcheng to the south. A machinery industry also grew up, at first mainly concentrating on the production of agricultural equipment and diesel engines. Nanchang then became a minor centre of the automotive industry in China, producing trucks and tractors and also accessories such as tires. An iron-smelting plant helping to supply local industry was installed in the later 1950s. There is also a large chemical industry, producing agricultural chemicals and insecticides as well as pharmaceuticals.

<text>Łęczna is a town in eastern Poland with 19,780 inhabitants (2014), situated in Lublin Voivodeship. It is the seat of Łęczna County and the smaller administrative district of Gmina Łęczna. The town is located in northeastern corner of historic province of Lesser Poland. Łęczna tops among the hills of the Lublin Upland, at the confluence of two rivers—the Wieprz, and the Świnka. On December 31, 2010, the population of the town was 20,706. Łęczna does not have a rail station, the town has been placed on a national Route 82 from Lublin to Włodawa. And shall be considered as a start point to Kameralne Pojezierze, as the town has decided to rebrand the lakeland district, from Pojezierze Łęczyńsko-Włodawskie, or Pojezierze Łęczyńskie, to Kameralne Pojezierze.

== History ==
===Middle Ages===
First documented mention of the village of Łęczna comes from the year 1252. At that time, the area east of Lublin (eastern borderlands of Lesser Poland) was sparsely populated, without any towns and with few villages, as the region was frequently raided by the Mongols, Tatars, Lithuanians, Yotvingians and East Slavs. This changed in the late 14th century, after the Union of Krewo (1385), when the Polish–Lithuanian Union was established between the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1462, a local nobleman (see szlachta), Zbigniew z Łęcznej, sold the village to the Tęczyński family. Five years later, on January 7, 1467, Jan of Tęczyn, the castellan of Kraków, received the Magdeburg town rights for the town of Łęczna (named after the village), on the Wieprz river. King Casimir IV Jagiellon issued the document in Kozienice, and Łęczna was strategically located on a hill, above sea level. Its first residents came from other town and villages of the region. It was located within the Lublin Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

===Early modern era===

Thanks to trade privileges granted by King Stephen Báthory in 1581, the town became one of the most important centres for trading horses and cattle in Poland. Merchants from both the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and abroad came here, and in the early 16th century, first Jewish settlers came to Łęczna. The town, located on a busy merchant route towards Volhynia and Lithuania, quickly developed, despite Tatar raids (late 15th and early 16th centuries), and several fires (1525, 1552, 1564, 1569). The Polish Golden Age and the first half of the 17th century were the period of prosperity of the town. Łęczna was in private hands, with a castle, a town hall, tenement houses, churches and a synagogue.

This ended in the mid-17th century, when in the Swedish invasion of Poland and other wars, Łęczna was destroyed several times. In 1693 almost all residents died in an epidemic, and 1710, the population was decimated by the plague. In the mid-18th century, the town burned in two fires (1746, 1761), and in the 1760s, Łęczna belonged to Bishop of Płock, Hieronim Szeptycki. In 1778, the 4th Infantry Regiment of the Polish Crown Army was garrisoned in Łęczna.

===Late modern era and recent times===

After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the town, with population of 1,500, became part of the Habsburg Empire, then it belonged to the Duchy of Warsaw (1809), and finally was part of the Congress Poland under Russian Empire (1815–1915). In the 19th and early 20th century, Łęczna was a small, unimportant town, located away from main roads and railways. Until 1866, it remained in private hands, and belonged to several families. Among its owners was Jan Gotlib Bloch. During the January Uprising, clashes between Polish insurgents and Russian troops took place on 30 October, 10 November and 25 December 1863 and 4 May 1864. In 1914, before the outbreak of World War I, Łęczna was the smallest of fourteen towns of Lublin Governorate. During the war, Łęczna lost 41% of its population, as a result of evacuation, forced by Russians. Again part of Poland, after the country regained independence in 1918, administratively it was part of the Lublin Voivodeship. By 1939, its population was 4,300. In the Invasion of Poland, Łęczna was briefly captured by the Red Army (late September 1939), and then handed over by them to Nazi Germany (see Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact).

In the 1960s, rich deposits of Bituminous coal were discovered here. Construction of first coal mine (Bogdanka Coal Mine) began in the nearby village of Bogdanka in 1975. In January 1999, for the first time in history, Łęczna became the seat of a county.

=== Jewish history ===
Łęczna had an evident Jewish community since the 15th century and until the Holocaust, after which no Jewish community existed in town. During the second half of the second millennia Łęczna became an important Jewish center in Central Europe, hosting the Council of Four Lands for several times. By 1803, 38% of the town population were Jews. This ratio of Jews had doubled itself by 1840 into 64%. The Jewish community continued to be prominent in town until World War II, when Nazi Germany occupied the town. In January 1940, a local Judenrat was established in order to organize the Jewish life in Łęczna under Nazi restrictions. During the Holocaust, around 2,500 Jews who lived in town were sent to Sobibor extermination camp and died. The Jewish community of Łęczna had ceased to exist.

Nowadays, a few Jewish establishments from the past still exist in town, among them the big synagogue, hosting the local museum, the small museum, hosting a local library and a Jewish cemetery.

== Tourism ==

Łęczna is located in the picturesque region known as &quot;Łęczna-Włodawa Lakeland&quot; (&quot;Pojezierze Łęczyńsko-Włodawskie&quot;). There are 68 lakes in the region, whose total area is 2,726 hectares. Furthermore, there are forests rich in birds and animals, and Polesie National Park lies a few kilometers north of the town. The &quot;Regional Museum of Łęczna&quot;, opened in 1966, is located in a 17th-century synagogue. The town also has St. Mary Magdalene church, built in 1618–1631.

== Economy ==
Since the 1970s the town has benefited from the proximity of profitable coal mining industry. The village of Bogdanka near Łęczna was the place of the first coal mine in the whole area of the Lublin Coal Basin (&quot;Lubelskie Zagłębie Węglowe&quot;). The town has other small industries, and is regarded as the center of the coal basin

<text>Lubartów () is a town in eastern Poland, with 23,000 inhabitants (2004), situated in Lublin Voivodeship. It is the capital of Lubartów County and the Lubartów Commune. Historically it belongs to Lesser Poland.

Lubartów was established in 1543 by Piotr Firlej under a founding order issued by King Sigismund the Old.

The town is located north of Lublin, on the Wieprz river, on the border between two geographical regions of Poland - Lublin Upland, and South Podlasie Lowland. Near Lubartów, the &quot;Kozłowiec Landscape Park&quot; (&quot;Kozłowiecki Park Krajobrazowy&quot;) is located. The town is the 10th largest urban center of the voivodeship, and its area is .

==Name==
The town&#x27;s original Polish name was &quot;Lewartów&quot; (pronounced [lɛ&#x27;vartuf]) until 1744, when it was changed to Lubartów. Yiddish language, however, retains the original name &quot;Lewartów&quot; to this day (but pronounced [&#x27;lɛvatof]).

== History ==

The history of Lubartów begins on May 29, 1543, when King Sigismund the Old allowed local nobleman Piotr Firlej to found a town called &quot;Lewartów&quot; (the original name comes from Lewart, the coat of arms of the Firlej family). Lubartów was a private town, administratively located in the Lublin Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province. The town became famous when it belonged to Mikołaj Firlej, the son of Piotr Firlej. In 1559, Wojciech Calissius founded a Protestant school in the town, which was one of centers of Calvinism in Lesser Poland in the late 16th century. Mikołaj Firlej invited a number of skilled artisans from France, Germany and Holland, as well as cattle breeders. Lewartów frequently changed owners. In the early 18th century it belonged to the Sanguszko family, who rebuilt the palace, built two Baroque churches and tenement houses. Upon request of Paweł Karol Sanguszko, on November 22, 1744, King Augustus III of Poland changed the name of the town to Lubartów (in honor of Lubart - Liubartas, the son of Lithuanian Prince Gediminas; Sanguszko believed that Liubartas was the founder of his family). King Augustus granted a new coat of arms to the town.

The town was annexed by Austria in the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. Following the Austro-Polish War of 1809 it was included in the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw. The 19th century was not lucky for Lubartów, as the town, which from 1815 to 1915 belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland, burned several times (1831, 1838, 1846). Two battles between Polish insurgents and Russian troops were fought there during the Polish uprisings of 1830–1831 and 1863–1864. In 1866 it became the seat of a county, and slowly began modernization. By 1912 it had seven manufacturing enterprises, including mills and a brewery, in 1922, glassworks were opened.
Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany. In October 1939, the Germans executed nine Poles, accused of possession of weapons. On December 23, 1939, the German police carried out a massacre of 48 Poles in the town. Tadeusz Illukiewicz, starost of the Lubartów County, was imprisoned in the Lublin Castle in October 1939, and then murdered in Lublin in December 1939 in a massacre of 10 Poles perpetrated as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;. In June 1940, during the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;, the Germans carried out mass arrests of around 500 Poles, who were then imprisoned in Lublin, and many of whom were soon deported to the Sachsenhausen and Auschwitz concentration camps. In 1941, the Jews were confined to a ghetto, and in 1942 they were deported to extermination camps and the ghetto was liquidated. The town was liberated by the Polish Home Army in July 1944.

An unusual accumulation of amber deposits has been discovered in areas near Lubartow. A company called Stellarium is already mining these deposits, hailed as &quot;the new amber route. Data from Poland&#x27;s National Geological Institute in 2019 estimated that amber deposits in the Lubartów area of the Lublin region may be up to 25 times larger than those in the northern Pomerania region, 1,500 tons vs. 59 tons. And the region&#x27;s amber deposits are available not as deep as in the north of the country, making mining more economically viable.

== Jews of Lubartów ==
From its foundation until World War II, the town also had a large Jewish community, numbering nearly half of the population in the 1930s. However nearly the entire community was destroyed during the Holocaust. Lubartów was a bilingual town for most of its history, Polish and Yiddish being both widely used. Polish was used among non-Jews as well as for most communication between Jewish and non-Jewish townspeople, while Yiddish was the everyday language of the town&#x27;s Jewish inhabitants.

== Points of interest ==

Among most interesting points of interest is the Sanguszko Palace (18th century). The original palace was built in the mid-16th century as a fortified residence by Piotr Firlej II. In 1693 architect Tylman van Gameren created a plan for rebuilding of the palace for Józef Karol Lubomirski, and in 1705, the complex was partially burned during the Great Northern War. The palace was rebuilt from the funds of Paweł Karol Sanguszko, and burned again in 1933. Rebuilt in 1950–1970, it now is home to starosta of Lubartów County. Another interesting object are: Baroque St. Anne Basilica (1733-1738), and the monastery of Order of Friars Minor Capuchin with the St. Lawrence Church (1737-1741). There is also a museum (&quot;Muzeum Ziemi Lubartowskiej&quot;), located in a historic manor house.

==Transport==
Lubartów is a road hub, where National road 19 (Rzeszów–Białystok) meets Voivodeship road 815. Furthermore, Lubartów is located along the rail line No. 30 (Łuków–Lublin).

==Sports==
The local football club is Lewart Lubartów, founded in 1923. It competes in the lower leagues.

==Cuisine==
Among the protected traditional local foods, as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, are:
* Buckwheat honey, typical to the Lublin Region including Lubartów. Rich in magnesium, iron, vitamin C and protein, it is used to treat a wide range of diseases.
* &quot;Makowiec lubartowski&quot;, a local type of poppy seed roll.
* &quot;Pasztecik z grzybami&quot;, a baked puff pastry stuffed with mushrooms, onions, olive oil and spices, sprinkled with cheese. It is a local dish of Lubartów and nearby Ostrów Lubelski.

<text>Kraśnik is a town in southeastern Poland with 35,602 inhabitants (2012), situated in the Lublin Voivodeship, historic Lesser Poland. It is the seat of Kraśnik County. The town of Kraśnik as it is known today was created in 1975, after the merger of its two districts - &quot;Kraśnik Lubelski&quot;, and &quot;Kraśnik Fabryczny&quot;.

==Location and districts==

Kraśnik is located in Lesser Poland, among the hills of Lublin Upland, 49 kilometers south-west of Lublin. The town is divided into two major parts, which are a few kilometers apart: &quot;Kraśnik Fabryczny&quot; and &quot;Kraśnik Lubelski&quot; (or &quot;Kraśnik Stary, Old Kraśnik&quot;). The town has an area of 25.28 square kilometers, of which arable land makes up 45%, and forests 17%.

===Kraśnik Lubelski===
Kraśnik Lubelski is the original part of the town where all historic buildings are located. It is made of several districts, such as &quot;Old Town, Bojanówka, Koszary, Góry, Zarzecze, Kwiatkowice&quot;, and &quot;Osiedle Kolejowe&quot;. Kraśnik Lubelski has old churches and the oldest cemetery of the town, as well as a rail station, a bus station and main administrative offices of the county. It is also a major road junction, where future Expressway S19 (current National Road No. 19) meets National Road No. 74. Until 2010, the Road 74 went through the center of Kraśnik, but now there is a by-pass.

===Kraśnik Fabryczny===
Kraśnik Fabryczny was founded in the late 1930s, as a settlement for &quot;State Ammunition Factory No. 2&quot; (&quot;Panstwowe Fabryka Amunicji nr. 2&quot;), one of the enterprises built as part of the Central Industrial Region. Previously, in the location of Kraśnik Fabryczny there was the village of Dąbrowa Bór, placed a few kilometers northwest of Kraśnik, in a forest between Kraśnik and Urzędów. The government of the Second Polish Republic planned a new settlement, built from scratch, for 6,000 people around the new Ammunition Factory No. 2, FLT-Kraśnik. After the war, the settlement of Dąbrowa Bór was expanded, and in 1954 its name was changed to Kraśnik Fabryczny. In the 1960s, a number of single-family houses was built, later on, several blocks of flats were constructed. On October 1, 1975, Kraśnik Fabryczny merged with Kraśnik Lubelski, and the villages of Budzyń and Piaski, creating the town of Kraśnik. Currently, Kraśnik Fabryczny has some 20,000 inhabitants.

==History==

The area of Kraśnik was first settled in the 13th century, and the town received its city charter in 1377, by King Louis I of Hungary. At that time it belonged to Sandomierz Voivodeship, one of two voivodeships of Lesser Poland (Lublin Voivodeship was created in 1474, out of parts of Sandomierz Voivodeship). Located on a busy merchant road from Silesia to Kyiv, Kraśnik in the 14th century belonged to the Gorajski family. In 1403, it had a parish church of Saint Paul, and in 1410, as a dowry of Anna of Goraj, it passed into the hands of the Tęczyński family. Later on, it belonged to other families, such as the Radziwiłłs, and in 1604, the town was purchased by hetman Jan Zamoyski. Until 1866, Kraśnik belonged to the Zamoyski family. The town frequently suffered from fires, it was also destroyed by the Swedes in 1657, during the Deluge.

Since the 14th century, Kraśnik was surrounded by a rampart, and ca. 1465, stone-brick walls were built on initiative of Jan Tęczyński, with two gates - &quot;Lublin Gate&quot; and &quot;Sandomierz Gate&quot;. The walls were demolished in the second half of the 19th century. Kraśnik also had a defensive church, surrounded with a high wall, and a castle, built in the 14th century on a hill surrounded by swamps. By 1646, the castle was already neglected. In 1657, it was completely destroyed by the Swedes.

Until the Third Partition of Poland (1795), Kraśnik belonged to Lublin Voivodeship, then passed into Austrian hands. In 1807 it was included in the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and from 1815 until 1915 the town was in the Russian Empire (Congress Poland). In August 1914, the town and surrounding area were a focal point of Battle of Kraśnik, an opening battle of the World War I struggle between Russia and Central Powers over control of Galicia. During the war, the town gained its first railway connection, as a line was built through it by the Russians in 1914 in order to deliver supplies to the front. Later on, the line was expanded, and now it joins Lublin with Stalowa Wola.

In 1938 Kraśnik was selected as the location for an ammunition factory (see Central Industrial Region). The factory was not finished by the time World War II broke out in 1939, and during the German occupation it was used to manufacture parts for Heinkel planes and other purposes. After the war, in 1948, the factory was started up again, this time to produce ball bearings (the first factory to do that in Poland).

===Jews in Kraśnik===
As with much of the Lublin district, Kraśnik was a major center of Judaism, with 5,000 Jews (almost 50% of the population) prior to World War II. Historical accounts place Jews in the area in 1531, but the official right to settle there was granted to Jews in 1584. In 1654, Jewish residence was officially limited to the area near the synagogue, but in practice this was not rigidly enforced.Following the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II, Kraśnik was taken over by the Soviets in 1939 and later by the Nazis during Operation Barbarossa. It was the site of the Budzyń concentration camp, where the prisoners worked for the Heinkel &quot;Flugzeugwerke&quot; factory on aircraft production. This camp, with around 3,000 Jews, became a subcamp of Majdanek.
There was another labor camp in Kraśnik called the WIFO Labor Camp, or the Kraśnik Labor Camp (also called &quot;ZwangsArbeitslager Skret&quot;), located in the ghetto at Szkolna and Bóżnicza streets. It had a similar number of people in it (around 3,000), most of whom were murdered. From a population of more than 5,000 Kraśnik Jews, only an estimated 350 survived the Holocaust; most or all of these survivors left Poland.

==International relations==
===Twin towns===
Kraśnik is twinned with:
* Hajdúböszörmény, Hungary
* Ruiselede, Belgium
* Šilalė, Lithuania
* Korosten, Ukraine
* Turiisk, Ukraine
* Trogir, Croatia

Former twin towns:
* Nogent-sur-Oise, France (In February 2020, the French commune suspended its partnership with Kraśnik as a reaction to the passing of an anti-LGBT resolution by the Kraśnik local authorities.)

==Controversies==
===LGBT-free zone (2019-2021)===


In 2019, Kraśnik&#x27;s city council has adopted an LGBT-free zone resolution, which led to the city&#x27;s budget losing 10 million euros from EEA and Norway Grants, getting expelled from a European Union twin town cooperation program and losing twin town status with Nogent-sur-Oise. In 2021, an appeal to repeal the vote by the mayor was rejected by the town council. The resolution was finally overturned on April 29, 2021.
===5G-free zone===

On 24 September 2020, Kraśnik councilors voted to consider the ban on 5G mobile telephony in the city. Support was given to the petition of the &quot;Poland Free from 5G Coalition Association&quot; &quot;(pl: Stowarzyszenie Koalicja Polska Wolna od 5G)&quot;, which also provides for an order to dismantle Wi-Fi networks in schools.

<doc id="386887" wikidata="Q2346769" url="?curid=386887" title="Rorschach (character)">
<text>Rorschach (Walter Joseph Kovacs) is a fictional antihero and one of the protagonists in the graphic novel limited series &quot;Watchmen&quot;, published by DC Comics in 1986. Rorschach was created by writer Alan Moore with artist Dave Gibbons; as with most of the main characters in the series, he was an analogue for a Charlton Comics character; in this case, Steve Ditko&#x27;s the Question. Moore also modeled Rorschach on Mr. A, another Steve Ditko creation on whom the Question was originally based.

While &quot;Watchmen&quot; has an ensemble cast, many consider Rorschach to be the primary protagonist as he drives most of the plot forward and serves as the series&#x27; narrator. In the beginning of the story, he is introduced as the only masked vigilante to remain active on his own terms and initiative, a criminal outlaw as opposed to other former superheroes now covertly employed by the U.S. government. A ruthless crime-fighter, Rorschach believes in moral absolutism—good and evil as pure ends, with no shades of gray—which compels him to seek to punish any evidence of evil at all costs. His mask displays a constantly morphing inkblot based on the ambiguous designs used in Rorschach inkblot tests, also his namesake, with the mask&#x27;s black and white coloring consistent with his sense and view of morality.

The original character was positively received, with multiple references in other comic titles and appearances in other media. He reappears in the &quot;Before Watchmen&quot; comic book prequel including his own miniseries. Rorschach made his live-action debut in the 2009 film &quot;Watchmen&quot;, played by Jackie Earle Haley, who also voices him in the video game &quot;&quot;.

A successor to the Rorschach mantle, named Reggie Long, debuted in the sequel limited series &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, which connects the &quot;Watchmen&quot; universe with the mainstream DC Universe. Another incarnation of Rorschach, Wil Myerson, appears in the DC Black Label limited series &quot;Rorschach&quot;, a standalone sequel to &quot;Watchmen&quot;.

==Publication history==
As with the rest of the main characters of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Alan Moore based Rorschach on Charlton Comics characters, using them as a &quot;starting point&quot;. The characters Rorschach was specifically based on were the Question (a Charlton character) and Mr. A, two comic book characters created by Steve Ditko.

Ditko, who was inspired by the writings of Ayn Rand&#x27;s personal philosophy of Objectivism, created both the Question and Mr. A as followers of the ideology. Regarding Rand&#x27;s philosophy, Moore said he personally found it &quot;laughable&quot;. In spite of this, Moore had a healthy respect for Ditko despite having different views politically. Moore recalled that Ditko&#x27;s very right-wing agenda was quite interesting to him at the time, and that &quot;probably led to me portraying Rorschach as an extremely right-wing character&quot;.

In trying to create Rorschach, Moore said he was trying to &quot;come up with this quintessential Steve Ditko character—someone who&#x27;s got a funny name, whose surname begins with a &#x27;K,&#x27; who&#x27;s got an oddly designed mask&quot;. On how he decided Rorschach&#x27;s name, Moore recalls:

The Question was used as the prototype for creating Rorschach, while Mr. A, being a far more radical right-wing character than the mainstream-suited Question, served as the main inspiration for Rorschach&#x27;s right-wing views as well as his black-and-white morality. Moore came to view Rorschach as a logical extension of both Mr. A and the Question. On the other hand, upon being asked whether he had seen &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Ditko himself described Rorschach as being &quot;like Mister A, except Rorschach is insane.&quot;
Moore stated that Rorschach was created as a way of exploring what an archetypical Batman-type character—a driven, vengeance-fueled vigilante—would be like in the real world. He concluded that the short answer was &quot;a nutcase&quot;. Moore also stated that the tone of Rorschach&#x27;s diary was inspired by the Son of Sam letters David Berkowitz sent to the newspapers, and that his speech patterns were based on Herbie the Fat Fury.

While Moore came up with Rorschach&#x27;s name and descriptions, Dave Gibbons was in charge of the character&#x27;s appearance. In Gibbons&#x27; initial designs, Rorschach wore white clothing which had inkblots not only on his head but all over his body. He also wore a large blue trench-coat, red gloves, red-blue hat and items that look like jodhpurs or spats over his boots. When designing the characters of the series, Gibbons said Rorschach was his favorite to draw due to his relatively simpler features. He described:

Moore said he did not foresee the death of Rorschach until the fourth issue when he realized that his refusal to compromise would result in his not surviving the story. He claimed that initially he knew a lot about the character&#x27;s surface mannerisms, but did not realize what was inside him until he &quot;started to dig.&quot; Moore added that Rorschach had a &quot;king-sized&quot; deathwish due to his psychologically troubled life, and actively wanted to die but in his own dignified and honorable way, no matter how &quot;twisted&quot; it might have been. In response to why he chose to have Rorschach take off his mask to face death at the end, Moore said that he thought it &quot;just felt right&quot;. He believed that it &quot;is not the mask talking, it&#x27;s not Rorschach, it&#x27;s the actual human being [Walter Kovacs] that is somewhere under there&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
===Before &quot;Watchmen&quot;===
Walter Joseph Kovacs was born on March 21, 1940, the son of Sylvia Kovacs, who was a prostitute, and an unknown father only known to Kovacs as &quot;Charlie&quot;. His mother was frequently abusive and condescending towards him. In July 1951, at the age of 11, Kovacs became involved in a violent fight with two older bullies; subsequently, his living conditions were finally looked into. After his home was investigated, Kovacs was removed from his mother&#x27;s care and put in &quot;The Lillian Charlton Home for Problem Children&quot; in New Jersey, where he rapidly seemed to improve, excelling at scholastics as well as gymnastics and amateur boxing. In 1956, after leaving the Charlton Home when he was 16, Kovacs took a job as a garment worker in a dress shop, which he found &quot;bearable but unpleasant&quot; partly because he had to handle women&#x27;s clothing; it was here that he acquired a certain dress fabric that he would later fashion into the mask he wears as Rorschach. His mother was brutally murdered by her pimp, George Paterson, who forced her to drink Drano cleaning fluid and dumped her body in the back alleyway. In 1962, Kovacs scavenged the material from a rejected dress that had been special-ordered by a young woman with an Italian name. Though Kovacs learned how to cut and fashion the material successfully with heated implements, he soon grew bored with it, as it served him no real purpose at the time.

Two years later when buying a newspaper on his way to work in March 1964, Kovacs read about the rape and murder of Kitty Genovese, who he believed was the Italian woman who had rejected the dress. Ashamed by what he read about the unresponsiveness of her neighbors, Kovacs became disillusioned with the underlying apathy that he saw as inherent in most people. Inspired by Genovese&#x27;s fate, Kovacs returned home, made &quot;a face [he] could bear to look at in the mirror&quot; from the dress&#x27;s fabric, and began fighting crime as the vigilante Rorschach. Initially, Kovacs left criminals alive, but bloodied, for the police to arrest, leaving a calling card in the form of a Rorschach test at every crime scene. In the mid 1960s, he teamed up with Nite Owl II, a partnership which proved highly successful at battling organized crime.

In 1975, an investigation into the kidnapping of a young girl named Blair Roche led to the transformation of the &quot;soft&quot; Kovacs into the ruthlessly uncompromising Rorschach. He tracked the kidnapping to a man named Gerald Grice. At Grice&#x27;s shack, Kovacs found evidence Grice had killed the girl and had fed her remains to his dogs. Discovering this, Rorschach suffered a psychotic breakdown, killed the dogs with Grice&#x27;s meat cleaver and waited for his arrival. When Grice returned, Rorschach hurled the corpses of the dogs through his windows, handcuffed him to a stove, and poured kerosene around him. Leaving Grice a hacksaw, Rorschach told him that his only chance to escape would be by cutting off his hand. Rorschach then set the shack on fire and left. No one emerged. During a later psychological evaluation, the vigilante stated that Kovacs went into the shack, but that Rorschach came out.

When the Keene Act was passed in 1977 to outlaw vigilantes, Rorschach responded by killing a wanted serial rapist and leaving his body outside a police station with a note bearing one word: &quot;never!&quot;

===In &quot;Watchmen&quot;===
By 1985 and the events of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Rorschach is the vigilante who continues to operate in defiance of the Keene Act, the rest having retired or become government operatives. He investigates the murder of a man named Edward Blake, discovering that he is the Comedian. He believes that someone is picking off costumed superheroes, a view that strengthens when Doctor Manhattan is forced into exile and when Adrian Veidt, the former vigilante known as Ozymandias, is targeted in an assassination attempt. Rorschach questions Moloch, a former supervillain who unexpectedly attends Blake&#x27;s funeral, who tells him what little he knows. Later, after reading a note written by Moloch telling him to come over for more information, Rorschach visits him again, only to find him dead, shot through the head. The police, tipped off anonymously over the phone, surround the house. Rorschach scolds himself for falling into such an obvious trap, and is arrested after a fight, in which Rorschach tries to escape by jumping through a window, but is unmasked. After the unmasking, Rorschach is revealed to be the red-haired man who, in addition to being the first character to appear in the series, was shown several times in the early chapters carrying a sign reading &quot;THE END IS NIGH&quot;.

Rorschach is sent to a prison where many of its inmates are criminals he put away, including Big Figure, a dwarf crime boss who is hungry for Rorschach&#x27;s blood. During his incarceration, he is interviewed by the prison psychologist Dr. Malcolm Long. Long believes he can help rehabilitate him; instead, Rorschach&#x27;s explanation of his life and his justifications for his uncompromising worldview lead Long to question his own views.

One day during lunch, one of the inmates attempts to attack Rorschach with a shiv, whereupon Rorschach throws the boiling-oil contents of a deep-fryer into his face in self-defense. As the guards grab and begin to beat him, Rorschach hoarsely yells at the watching crowd, &quot;None of you seem to understand. I&#x27;m not locked in here with you. You&#x27;re locked in here with me.&quot; After the inmate dies, the prison breaks out in a riot. The Big Figure and two of his associates try to kill Rorschach, but he outwits and ultimately kills them all in rapid succession. Rorschach&#x27;s two former colleagues, Nite Owl II and Silk Spectre II, begin to take his &quot;mask killer&quot; theory seriously and break him out of jail to follow up on it.

After the prison break, Doctor Manhattan comes back from his self-exile to transport Silk Spectre II to Mars. After acquiring a spare costume from his apartment, Rorschach, along with Nite Owl, enters underworld bars to find out who ordered the assassination attempt on Veidt. They obtain a name, a company called Pyramid Deliveries, and then break into Veidt&#x27;s office. Nite Owl correctly deduces Veidt&#x27;s password and finds that he runs Pyramid Deliveries. Rorschach, who has been keeping a journal throughout the duration of the novel, realizes that they may be no match for Veidt. He makes one last entry in his journal, stating his certainty that Veidt is responsible for whatever might happen next, and drops it into a mailbox.

Nite Owl and Rorschach fly out to Antarctica. There they learn the true nature of the conspiracy and Veidt&#x27;s motivations: to unite the world against a perceived alien threat and stop the possibility of a nuclear holocaust. Veidt then reveals that he set his plan into motion well before they arrived. Doctor Manhattan and Silk Spectre II arrive at the base after viewing the carnage Veidt&#x27;s false alien has wrought on New York City. Despite their mutual horror, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre II and Doctor Manhattan all agree to keep quiet about the true nature of the events when the United States surprisingly does enter into a peace accord with the Soviet Union.

Rorschach states the others must be joking, and leaves to tell the world. Dr. Manhattan confronts him outside, telling him he cannot allow Rorschach to reveal the truth. Refusing to compromise his principles, Rorschach understands he will be killed. He removes his mask and demands that Manhattan just &quot;do it&quot;, which he does.

In the final scenes of the comic, Rorschach&#x27;s journal has made it to the offices of the &quot;New Frontiersman&quot;, a right-wing newspaper. Outraged by the new accord between the Soviet Union and the United States, the editor pulls a planned two-page story. He leaves it to his assistant Seymour to decide how to fill that space, and Seymour begins to reach for the paper&#x27;s &quot;Crank File,&quot; which contains the journal. The outcome is ambiguous.

=== Events of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; ===

A new character takes on the name of Rorschach in the 2017 series &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; by Geoff Johns and Gary Frank. The events of &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; begin with Robert Redford winning the 1992 election by using the details of Kovacs&#x27; journal, which he gained from the &quot;New Frontiersman&quot;, leading the citizens of New York to rally against Ozymandias, while the United States faces an inevitable nuclear war. Reggie Long, son of Kovacs&#x27;s prison psychologist Dr. Malcolm Long, later takes on the Rorschach mantle after being driven insane by Veidt&#x27;s monster and learning self-defense techniques from former Mothman Byron Lewis, and mistakenly believing that his father and Rorschach had been friends after reading parts of his reports on him. The identity of this new Rorscach is not revealed until issue four.

=== Events of &quot;Rorschach&quot; ===
Thirty-five years after the death of Rorschach, right-wing vigilante Laura &quot;The Kid&quot; Cummings brainwashes two elderly comic book creators, Wil Myerson and Frank Miller, into believing that they are Rorschach&#x27;s reincarnation, before attempting to assassinate Robert Redford&#x27;s political opponent, being killed themselves in the process.

== Characterization ==
===Appearance===
Rorschach is 5&#x27;6&quot; tall and weighs 140 pounds, and, as Walter Kovacs (his &quot;disguise&quot;), he appears as a red-haired, expressionless man who always carries with him a sign that reads &quot;THE END IS NIGH&quot;. Most people who see Kovacs consider him ugly and Rorschach himself states that he cannot bear to look upon his own human face, considering his mask (or true &quot;face&quot;) to be beautiful instead. His clothing then matches those of a homeless man, which seems to be his disguise when he has not donned his vigilante attire.

During Rorschach&#x27;s nighttime patrols, he wears a striped purple business suit, similarly colored leather gloves, a grayed scarf, and heavily unpolished elevator shoes. More signature of his apparel is his brown trench coat with his matching fedora hat that has a light purple stripe. However, Rorschach&#x27;s most defining feature of his costume is his ink-blotted mask.

Rorschach&#x27;s mask, which he considers his true &quot;face&quot;, is a piece of fabric made from a material derived from the technologies of Dr. Manhattan, and it is blank except on the front, where two viscous liquids, one black and one white, are between two layers of latex. The liquids continually shift in response to heat and pressure, which explains why the liquid only animates when Rorschach puts it on his face. The black liquids form symmetrical patterns like those of a Rorschach inkblot test while never mixing with the white color of the mask, thus never producing a gray color, much like Rorschach&#x27;s view of morality and the world.

===Personality===
During his childhood, Walter Kovacs was described as bright, and excelled in literature, mathematics, political science, and religious education. Kovacs continues a one-man battle against crime long after superheroes have become both detested and illegal, eventually replacing his Kovacs identity with the persona of Rorschach. Rorschach considers his mask his true &quot;face&quot; and his unmasked persona to be his &quot;disguise&quot;, refusing to answer to his birth name during his trial and psychiatric sessions. Moore depicted Rorschach as being extremely right-wing, and morally absolute, a viewpoint that has alienated him from the rest of society, even among other superheroes. Rorschach presents his views on right and wrong as starkly black and white with no room for compromise, with the exception of his respect for the Comedian, whose attempted rape of the first Silk Spectre he dismisses as a &quot;moral lapse&quot;. He holds deep contempt for behavior he considers immoral and is openly derogatory toward heroes who do not share his unwavering views, deriding them as &quot;soft&quot;.

Rorschach displays a discomfort with female sexuality as a result of his early childhood, although the crimes that most affected him spiritually were against women: the murders of Kitty Genovese and Blair Roche. Rorschach is often described as being mentally ill by other characters in the comic.

===Skills and abilities===
Like most characters in &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Rorschach has no obvious &quot;superpowers&quot;. He merely has his strong will, peak-human physical strength, and finely-honed sense of timing and precision. Rorschach is very resourceful and creative, adapting ordinary household objects into tools or weapons, such as the use of a can of aerosol spray in combination with multiple matches to set fire to a police officer and throwing ground black pepper to blind another police officer, during a confrontation at Moloch&#x27;s house. During the series he is shown to use cooking fat, a toilet bowl, a cigarette, a fork and his jacket all as weapons; he is also shown using a coat hanger as a makeshift measuring device. He owns a gas-powered grappling gun, which he uses to climb buildings (and once as a makeshift harpoon gun against a police officer), as seen in Chapter One, which was designed and built by Nite Owl II.

Rorschach is well versed in street combat, gymnastics, and boxing. He is also extremely stoic, as shown by his indifference to pain and discomfort. He even tolerated Antarctic temperatures while wearing only a trenchcoat over street clothes, without complaining or even commenting on the severe cold.

Despite his mental instability, Rorschach is extremely intelligent and was described as &quot;tactically brilliant and unpredictable&quot; by Nite Owl, and shows a marked affinity for detective work, as evidenced by his ability to locate the Comedian&#x27;s costume in his apartment when the police could not. Much like Batman in the mainstream DC Universe, Rorschach is given the title of &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Detective.&quot;

He is also skilled at lock picking (although a running gag throughout the series has him simply forcing Nite Owl&#x27;s front door to talk to him).

==Reception==
The character of Rorschach has been received with critical acclaim by critics, reviewers, and readers; he has also been awarded. In 1988, the character won the &quot;Character Most Worthy of Own Title&quot; category in the American Section of the Eagle Awards for comics released during 1987. Rorschach has been labelled the &quot;obvious fan favorite&quot; and the &quot;flagship&quot; character of &quot;Watchmen&quot;, and is often regarded as the most iconic and popular character of the series. The misanthropic character&#x27;s popularity has led author Alan Moore to proclaim &quot;Watchmen&quot;″s failure as literature.

Rorschach was named the 6th-greatest comic book character of all time by &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine in May 2008, with the magazine stating that &quot;Rorschach still stands as one of the most compelling and frightening characters in comics&#x27; history.&quot; In July 2008, he was ranked as the 16th &quot;Greatest Comic Book Character&quot; by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, which, when picking their top &quot;Watchmen&quot; character, proclaimed &quot;from a purely iconic point of view, it had to be Rorschach&quot; and described him as &quot;taut, tortured, complex creation who, as well as being at the centre of some of &quot;Watchmen&quot;″s most memorable sequences [...], ends up being perhaps the most pure out of the graphic novel&#x27;s characters.&quot; TopTenz placed Rorschach 3rd on their 2010 list of the &quot;Top 10 Comic Book Anti-Heroes (Marvel &amp; DC)&quot; where he was described as &quot;just one of many outstanding characters introduced during the landmark &quot;Watchmen&quot; series, but he is far and away the most popular and fascinating.&quot; In 2011, IGN ranked the character 16th on their &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Heroes&quot; list, noting that &quot;One has to admire his determination, if not necessarily his methods.&quot; Rorschach&#x27;s friendship with Nite Owl II was listed 10th on Fandomania&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Top 10 Sci-Fi/Fantasy Friendships&quot; list, which commented that &quot;even though they have contrasting world views, they have the same belief towards crime: it must be fought against.&quot;

In the making of the film adaptation, director Zack Snyder said &quot;no character&quot; was more important than Rorschach. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; further added on Snyder&#x27;s statement, claiming &quot;The filmmaker said [Rorschach] &#x27;is easily one of the greatest comic book characters ever&#x27; and that&#x27;s a view shared by many fans and the press that serves them.&quot; When asked what he thought of the character, Jackie Earle Haley responded that Rorschach was &quot;an awesome character. He is one twisted, sick individual but he&#x27;s still a fascinating character.&quot;

Haley&#x27;s performance as Rorschach in the &quot;Watchmen&quot; film has been acclaimed. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine remarked that the portrayals of Rorschach, along with Nite Owl, were the most successful and commented that Haley&#x27;s performance would make the audience &quot;half-wish Snyder might have stuck with Rorschach as [the sole] protagonist rather than spreading the net so wide.&quot; IGN praised Haley&#x27;s performance, despite his face being obscured for most of the film, as one of the film&#x27;s key highlights, proclaiming that &quot;Haley IS Rorschach. It&#x27;s not just a career-defining performance, it&#x27;s one of the best this genre has seen other than Heath Ledger&#x27;s Joker. He owns the screen whenever he&#x27;s on it.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; praised Haley, &quot;who does right by his grizzled role&quot; and named him and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (The Comedian) as the standout actors of the film.

==Other versions==
Rorschach has been referred to, quoted, and parodied several times in various media. These include:
*In &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; #2, a miniseries published by DC Comics in 1996, Rorschach appears as a background character breaking Brother Power&#x27;s fingers. He is also seen standing between the Question and Obsidian, during a scene in which Superman visits a metahuman bar.
*In 2007, Rorschach was featured in the promo artwork by Art Adams for the &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis: Arena&quot; miniseries by DC Comics, where he is being beaten by Batman from Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot;. However, DC opted to omit Rorschach and the aforementioned Batman from the actual &quot;Countdown to the Final Crisis: Arena&quot; miniseries.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Rorschach appears in &quot;&quot;, where he, along with every other character in the series, is voiced by actor Tom Stechschulte.
* In &quot;Watchmen&quot;, after Rorschach&#x27;s mysterious disappearance (in reality his death, as depicted at the end of the graphic novel), his journal was discovered. Published in a reactionary newspaper known for conspiracy theories, it was initially ignored. However, the journal was later appropriated by the &quot;Seventh Kavalry&quot;, a white supremacist splinter terrorist group, who, given Rorschach&#x27;s right-wing politics and description of morality as &quot;black-and-white&quot;, misinterpreted it as a racist manifesto. Members of the Kavalry wear crude replicas of Rorschach&#x27;s mask and attack members of the Tulsa police and their families for enforcing President Robert Redford&#x27;s reparations to victims of racial injustices, and intend to acquire the powers of Doctor Manhattan for themselves and their masters, the secret white supremacist order &quot;Cyclops&quot; led by Senator Joseph Keene, Jr.

===Film===

* Rorschach appears in &quot;Watchmen&quot;, portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley, with Eli Snyder, the son of the film&#x27;s director Zack Snyder, playing the young Rorschach in flashbacks. While Rorschach in the film adaptation is relatively faithful to his graphic novel counterpart, there are still some differences in description and storyline. Rorschach&#x27;s age in the film is 35, whereas in the graphic novel he is 45 years old (although this was most likely an error in production as his certificate marks him as forty-five). He is depicted in the film as being right-handed (justified by Jackie Earle Haley being right-handed) as opposed to left-handed. In the graphic novel, Rorschach consistently talks in a thudding pidgin while this is toned down in the film, with Rorschach talking in a more growling manner. His psychological instability in the film is downplayed, and he appears to be stronger than his graphic novel-self as he manages to ward off some attacking policemen, even after falling from an apartment window. He is also shown to openly disapprove of Nite Owl and Silk Spectre&#x27;s relationship. In the film, rather than Rorschach, Nite Owl II is the one who warns Ozymandias of the possible mask-killer, although Rorschach was revealed to have visited him earlier. Rorschach&#x27;s method of killing Grice differs also. In the film he uses the meat cleaver that killed Blair Roche to continuously hack the kidnapper, uttering after killing Grice, &quot;Men get arrested. Dogs get put down!&quot;. The number of times Rorschach visits the criminal underworld, Nite Owl and Moloch are reduced, and some of these scenes are also altered. Rorschach&#x27;s landlady, and anything concerning his apartment are left out; when obtaining his costume after the prison break, instead of wearing a spare one in his apartment, he regains his previous one in the prison. While Rorschach&#x27;s meeting with Dr. Malcolm Long is shown, this has been reduced to one meeting; also, Long&#x27;s dark subplot where Rorschach&#x27;s story affects his personal life and philosophy are omitted. Snyder admitted that while he did not film the scene he &quot;would have loved to.&quot; Rorschach&#x27;s confrontation with Dr. Manhattan is extended. Unlike in the novel, Nite Owl is present for Rorschach&#x27;s death, becoming enraged at Ozymandias after witnessing the spectacle. Snyder felt he &quot;needed a moment at the end&quot; and explained that he changed this scene because he wanted to show a glimpse of the &quot;sweet&quot; relationship between Rorschach and Nite Owl that was established in the film.
* Rorschach appears in the animated film Watchmen Chapter I, voiced by Titus Welliver.

===Video games===
* Rorschach appears as a playable character in &quot;&quot;, with Jackie Earle Haley reprising his role.

==In popular culture==
*In &quot;The Question&quot; #17 published by DC Comics in 1988, the Question, on whom Rorschach was partly based, actually read a copy of the &quot;Watchmen&quot; trade paperback. Question is briefly inspired by the comic and the character of Rorschach, leading him to take a more physically aggressive style of crime fighting. At the end of the issue, having been overpowered in hand-to-hand combat by a pair of villains, he is asked if he has any final words, and Question remarks, &quot;Rorschach sucks.&quot; Rorschach is also featured in a dream sequence experienced by the Question in that issue.
*In &quot;Deadpool: Sins of the Past&quot; #4, a miniseries published by Marvel Comics in 1994, Deadpool&#x27;s mask is forcibly removed by the Juggernaut, at which point Deadpool parrots Rorschach by screaming, &quot;My face! Give me back my face!&quot;.
*In &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot; vol. 3 #6 published by Marvel Comics in 2004, Rorschach makes another appearance in one of the riot scenes, running across the panel.
*In the 2009 one-shot comic &quot;Watchmensch&quot; released by Brain Scan Studios which parodies the &quot;Watchmen&quot; series, Rorschach is depicted as a lawyer who is known instead as &quot;Spottyman&quot; and is pretending to be Jewish.
*In &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #525 published by Marvel Comics in 2010, during the &quot;Second Coming&quot; storyline, Fantomex, while fighting a group of Nimrods from the future, imitates Rorschach&#x27;s line from when he was in prison: &quot;I&#x27;m not trapped in here with you... You&#x27;re trapped in here with me&quot; and then adds &quot;That film was stupid.&quot;
*During the Marvel storyline &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; when the master weaver shows the web of life to Solus, Morlun&#x27;s father, to show where Morlun is, various Spider-men are seen, one of them dressed like Rorschach but with red instead of white and with the black spots as eyes with smaller spots around them.
* The character Pastry Face II is used to represent Rorshach in the &quot;Simpsons Comics Spectacular&quot; #13 storyline &quot;Who Splotches the Splotchmen?&quot;
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 2007 episode &quot;Husbands and Knives&quot;, infant versions of Rorschach along with Ozymandias, Dr. Manhattan, and Nite Owl II are shown riding a surfboard on the cover of a DVD of the fictional film &quot;Watchmen Babies in V for Vacation&quot; (a parody of Alan Moore&#x27;s graphic novels &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;).
* The Question, as voiced by Jeffrey Combs in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, mimics Rorschach&#x27;s speaking patterns and monotone voice and his reputation for being crazy by the other heroes. In the episode &quot;Question Authority,&quot; after being beaten and tortured by Lex Luthor, the Question is rescued and unmasked, where it is revealed the ordeal has given him bruises resembling Kovacs&#x27; after his arrest; the Question additionally holds a sign reading &quot;The End is Nigh&quot;, identical to the sign Walter Kovacs is seen holding throughout the graphic novel.
*Rorschach, along with the other main characters of the graphic novel, are shown in &quot;Saturday Morning Watchmen&quot;, a 2009 Newgrounds and YouTube viral video which parodies the &quot;Watchmen&quot; series. In the video, Rorschach appears as a &quot;nutty&quot; character who usually is &quot;clowning around&quot;. He is also a &quot;friend to the animals&quot;, and is shown petting a pair of German Shepherds, in ironic contrast to the graphic novel.
* In the first episode of the second season of &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, Velma is dressed in an overcoat and fedora and asks Fred, &quot;Who were you expecting, Rorschach?&quot;
* Rorschach was briefly portrayed in the documentary &quot;The Mindscape of Alan Moore&quot;, where he is voiced by Alan Moore himself.
* In the Japanese manga &quot;Attack on Titan&quot;, the character Levi Ackerman was inspired by Rorschach, according to the series creator Hajime Isayama. In the same manga, the character Erwin Smith is inspired by Ozymandias, another character from &quot;Watchmen&quot;.
* Rorschach appears in Laura Beatty&#x27;s 2019 novel, &quot;Lost Property&quot;.

<text>Świdnik () is a town in southeastern Poland with 40,186 inhabitants (2012), situated in the Lublin Voivodeship, southeast of the city of Lublin. It is the capital of Świdnik County. Świdnik belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, and was first mentioned in historical records in the year 1392. It remained a village until the end of the 19th century when it began to develop as a spa, due to its location and climate.

In the early Middle Ages, the area of Świdnik was under the authority of a castellan from nearby Lublin. In the location of the current city three villages existed: &quot;Adampol&quot;, &quot;Świdnik&quot; and &quot;Krępiec&quot; (the name of the city itself was later taken from the village which was located in the immediate vicinity of the PZL Świdnik factory).

Świdnik, due to its location, is often considered to be a Satellite town of Lublin. The town is host to various industrial and advanced technology companies. It is a part of the Lublin Agglomeration, extending its business-oriented capabilities.

There are other villages named Świdnik in Poland, as well as Svidník, a town in Slovakia.

==History==
The first documented mention of Świdnik comes from the year 1392, and at that time the village was called &quot;Świdnik Wielki&quot; (&quot;Maior Swidnik, Magna Swydnyk&quot;). In the early 15th century, a &quot;Świdnik Mały&quot; (&quot;Świdnik Minor&quot;) appeared in documents and, in 1450, another village, &quot;Świdniczek&quot;, was mentioned. In 1564, &quot;Świdnik Wielki&quot; had a folwark, 32 peasants, 14 houses and a public house, and belonged to Lesser Poland&#x27;s Lublin Voivodeship. After the Partitions of Poland, all three villages briefly belonged to the Habsburg Empire (1795–1807). In 1815, they became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During the January Uprising, several skirmishes between Russian units and Polish rebels took place in the area of Świdnik. The biggest one was the Battle of Fajsławice (August 24, 1863), in which 63 Poles were killed. The battle is now commemorated by a monument. In 1877, Świdnik received its first rail connection, on the newly completed Vistula River Railroad. In 1905 – 1914, a red brick station was built; it now is the oldest public utility building in the city.

During World War I, heavy fighting between Russian and German and Austro-Hungarian units took place in the area of Świdnik (August 1914, July 1915). On July 30, 1915, the city was captured by the Austro-Hungarian Army, and remained under Austrian occupation until November 1918. A World War I military cemetery is located in the outskirts of Świdnik. In late 1918, the town became part of Lublin Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic. At that time Świdnik developed as a spa due to its unique microclimate. Świdnik&#x27;s district of Adampol was a popular leisure destination among residents of Lublin in the 1920s and 1930s.

Prior to World War II an airfield was built, which probably influenced the postwar decision of the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland to locate the PZL Świdnik plant here in the early 1950s. In 1937, the government of Poland purchased 136 hectares of land from the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and, in the autumn of that same year, construction of the complex of &quot;School of Civilian Pilots of the Airborne and Antigas Defence League&quot; was initiated. The school unofficially opened in late June 1938, and the first pilot training was carried out in the autumn of 1938. The size of the Świdnik airfield was 800 x 750 meters, and the official opening of the school took place on June 4, 1939. Both the airport and the school were bombed by the Luftwaffe on September 2, 1939, but the Wehrmacht did not capture Świdnik until September 17. During World War II, the Germans used the airfield and its facilities for their military purposes; it was one of main centers of the Luftwaffe in initial stages of Operation Barbarossa.

During the war, numerous Polish resistance units operated in the area of Świdnik, including the Home Army. In October 1941, Germans opened the Majdanek concentration camp, located in the village Majdan Tatarski, between Świdnik and Lublin. Furthermore, at the &quot;Krępiec Forest&quot; near Świdnik, numerous executions took place. As many as 30,000 people were murdered in these executions. The victims were largely both Polish and Jewish prisoners from the Majdanek Camp, the Lublin Castle prison and from other nearby towns and villages. The largest execution took place here on November 3, 1943, when German units shot 18,000 Jews. The massacres are commemorated by a monument-tomb, unveiled in the 1970s. In July 1944, Świdnik was captured by the Red Army. The Soviets immediately made use of the airfield, which had been sabotaged by the Germans prior to their retreat. On August 11, 1944 the first Soviet plane carrying members of the legitimate Polish government (see Government Delegation for Poland) took off from the airfield bound for Moscow. The Soviet Air Forces continued to make use of the Świdnik airfield until spring of 1946.

In 1949 the first trees were felled in the location of the future &quot;Transportation Equipment Factory&quot; (&quot;Wytwórnia Sprzętu Komunikacyjnego, WSK&quot;). The factory, which opened in 1951, quickly became one of the main centres of helicopter production both in the Eastern bloc and in Europe as a whole. In 1957 the factory was formally renamed WSK &quot;PZL-Świdnik&quot;. In the 1950s, a number of new blocks of flats for the workers was built, which resulted in rapid population growth. In 1951, a high school was opened to accommodate the families of these workers and, in 1952, production began at the factory. In 1951, the population of the settlement was 2,800 but, by 1955, it grew to almost 7,500. A town charter was granted to Świdnik in 1954. The first helicopter produced here, the Soviet-designed SM-1 (Mil Mi-1), flew in 1956 – around 1,800 were produced in Świdnik. In 1965 production switched to the Mil Mi-2, of which 5,450 were produced over the next three decades. The factory was its exclusive manufacturer. In the 1980s the factory started producing helicopters of Polish design – PZL W-3 Sokół and PZL SW-4 Puszczyk. Świdnik was designed as a model Communist town (see Urban planning in communist countries). New districts were built in the 1960s and 1970s, with schools, health centers, hospital and a cinema. Following the example of Nowa Huta, Communist authorities did not allow the construction of a Roman Catholic church for many years, despite the pledges of residents. The government finally relented in 1977. By then, the population of Świdnik was well over 20,000.
On July 8, 1980 a strike started in the WSK factory, which quickly spread to other factories in the Lublin region and brought the local economy to a standstill. The Communist government eventually managed to quell these mass protests by granting the workers many of their demands. However, the pressure for change generated by the strikes in turn led to the August strikes in Gdańsk and elsewhere on Poland&#x27;s Baltic Sea Coast, which shortly after led to the emergence of the Solidarity movement. During the Martial law in Poland, the town was an important center of both active and nonviolent resistance. On December 13, 1981, the workers at PZL Świdnik began a strike action, in protest of the Communist government. The plant was immediately surrounded by security services and Polish Army tanks and armoured vehicles. The strike was broken on December 15, when armed forces entered the factory. In the summer 1982 the town became famous across Poland for the so-called &quot;Świdnik Walks&quot; (&quot;Świdnickie spacery&quot;), in which its residents went for walks with their families and children at the time of the main news broadcast (&quot;Dziennik Telewizyjny&quot;, at 7:30 p.m. daily), in protest of Communist propaganda.

=== 21st Century ===
In 2010, AgustaWetland acquired PZL-Swidnik. Following this, the factory began production of a new type of medium-lift military helicopter, the AgustaWestland AW149.

==Transport==
The S17 and the S12 expressways, still under construction in some areas, concurrently bypass Świdnik before diverging at Piaski; Lublin Airport, located on the town&#x27;s outskirts, serves the whole voivodeship. Świdnik also has a rail station on a major line from Lublin towards Chełm and the border with Ukraine.

== Sport ==
The city is home to Avia Świdnik, a sports club, which independently runs two departments – men&#x27;s football and men&#x27;s volleyball.

<text>Puławy (, also written Pulawy) is a city in eastern Poland, in Lesser Poland&#x27;s Lublin Voivodeship, at the confluence of the Vistula and Kurówka Rivers. Puławy is the capital of Puławy County. The city&#x27;s 2019 population was estimated at 47,417. Its coat of arms is based on Pogonia.

Puławy was first mentioned in documents of the 15th century. At that time it was spelled &quot;Pollavy&quot;, its name probably coming from a Vistula River ford located nearby. The town is a local center of science, industry and tourism, together with nearby Nałęczów and Kazimierz Dolny. Puławy is home to Poland&#x27;s first permanent museum and is a Vistula River port.

The town has two bridges and four rail stations, and serves as a road junction. Nearby Dęblin has a military airport.

== Location and transport ==
Puławy lies in the western part of Lublin Voivodeship, at the edge of the picturesque Lesser Polish Gorge of the Vistula, and near the easternmost point of the Vistula river. Historically the town belongs to Lesser Poland, and geographically, it lies at the border of Mazovian Lowland and Lublin Upland. The area of the town is . Puławy is located on Polish Expressway S12 (highway), and the intersection of the S17 and S12 highways is located nearby, east of the city. Furthermore, the town has four rail stations (&quot;Puławy, Puławy Azoty, Puławy Chemia&quot; and &quot;Puławy Miasto&quot;). Long-distance rail transport is served by the &quot;Puławy Miasto&quot; station, with connections to all Polish cities.

==History==
The history of Puławy dates back to the 15th century when a settlement near a Vistula river ford was established. In the late 17th century it emerged as the location of a rural residence of the Lubomirski and the Sieniawski noble families and in 1676–1679, Prince Stanisław Herakliusz Lubomirski built a summer palace, now known as the Pałac Czartoryskich or the Czartoryskich Palace. In 1687, Lubomirski&#x27;s daughter Elżbieta (who was called the uncrowned &quot;Queen of Poland&quot;), married Adam Mikołaj Sieniawski, bringing Puławy her dowry. In 1706, during the Great Northern War, the settlement together with the castle were destroyed by Swedish soldiers as Elżbieta was a supporter of King Augustus II the Strong.
In 1731, Maria Zofia Sieniawska (the daughter of Elżbieta and Adam Sieniawski), married August Aleksander Czartoryski. As a result, Puławy remained in the hands of the Czartoryski family for the next 100 years. The settlement prospered, and in 1784 it became the property of Prince Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski and his wife Izabela Czartoryska, &quot;née&quot; Fleming. Under their stewardship, and after the loss of Poland&#x27;s independence in 1795 (see Partitions of Poland) the palace became a museum of Polish national memorabilia and a major cultural and political centre. In 1784 Adam and Izabela moved permanently into the palace, and soon afterwards Puławy became known as &quot;Polish Athens&quot;. All major cultural figures of the late 18th century Poland visited the palace. Among them were Grzegorz Piramowicz, Franciszek Dionizy Kniaźnin, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Adam Naruszewicz, Jan Paweł Woronicz, Franciszek Karpiński, Franciszek Zabłocki, Jan Piotr Norblin, Marcello Bacciarelli. In 1794, during the Kościuszko Uprising, Puławy was plundered and burned by the Russians as punishment for the Czartoryski family&#x27;s support of the rebels. The reconstruction of the palace was initiated in 1796 by Princess Izabela who employed the renowned architect Chrystian Piotr Aigner. In 1801, the Princess opened the first museum in Poland in the Temple of the Sibyl in Puławy.
The end of Puławy&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot; was marked by the November Uprising (1830–31), when after its suppression, the estate was taken over by the Russian government. The museum collections that were saved later became the nucleus of the present Czartoryski Museum in Kraków. In the 1830s, the Czartoryski family was forced to leave Russian-controlled Congress Poland (see Great Emigration), and Puławy was reduced into a small, provincial village. In 1842, to further erase traces of Polish culture, the Russians renamed Puławy to &quot;Nowa Aleksandria&quot;. In 1869, an Agricultural and Forestry Institute was founded here. One of its first students was the future Polish writer Bolesław Prus (who had also spent part of his early childhood in Puławy). Prus would set his 1884 micro-story, &quot;Mold of the Earth,&quot; at the &quot;Temple of the Sibyl&quot;.
===20th century===
Puławy received its town charter in 1906. In 1915, it was seized by the Austro-Hungarian Army, which remained until November 1918. On 13 August 1920, Józef Piłsudski, Poland&#x27;s Chief of State, left Warsaw, and established a military headquarters in Puławy. The Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army held most of eastern Poland and was besieging Warsaw, (see Polish–Soviet War). Piłsudski&#x27;s radio-monitoring, cryptological and intelligence services detected a gap in the Soviet flanks in the Puławy region, and he ordered a concentration of Polish forces in the surrounding area around the Wieprz River. On 18 August 1920, the Polish Army launched a counter-attack from Puławy that encircled and defeated a 177,000-strong Soviet force. The attack drove the Red Army from Poland and established Poland&#x27;s security for two decades, until the German invasion of 1939.

In the Second Polish Republic, Puławy began a slow process of modernization. In 1934, the town significantly grew in size, after several local villages merged with it. Furthermore, in the late 1930s Puławy took advantage of the Central Industrial Area.
In September 1939, during the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Puławy was seized by the Wehrmacht, and afterwards was occupied by Germany. Three German concentration camps operated around Puławy. In 1940 the Germans carried out mass arrests of local Polish intelligentsia, which was then imprisoned in Lublin, and then often deported to concentration camps or murdered in Rury, Lublin. During the occupation, Polish poet Krystyna Krahelska lived in the city from 1940 to 1942 and was part of the Polish underground resistance movement. She is best known as the author of the most popular song of the Polish resistance movement (&quot;Hej chłopcy, bagnet na broń&quot;), which she premiered in 1943 in Warsaw, where she was killed in the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. The town&#x27;s Jewish population of some 3,600 was first confined to a ghetto, then murdered at the Sobibór camp. The Jewish population ceased to exist and was never reconstituted. The town remained under German occupation until July 25, 1944, when it was freed by the Home Army, as well as the Red Army.

A year later, on April 24, 1945, a local unit of the anti-Communist organization Freedom and Independence under Marian Bernaciak captured the local office of Communist secret services temporarily.

The postwar history of Puławy has been dominated by the 1960 decision of the government of People&#x27;s Republic of Poland to build a large chemical plant north of the town (Zakłady Azotowe Puławy). It was opened in 1966 and produced nitrate fertilizer. As a result, in the 1960s and 1970s Pulawy quickly grew in size, with new districts built for the influx of workers. Recently the plant has become the world&#x27;s largest producer of melamine. In 1980 and 1981, &quot;Zakłady Azotowe Puławy&quot; was one of the largest centers of the Solidarity movement in the Lublin Region. After the declaration of Martial law in Poland (December 13, 1981), strike action was initiated in the plant, which was put down by force by the ZOMO on Dec. 19, and 20 people were arrested.

== Points of interest ==
The most notable landmark in Puławy is the Baroque-Classicist Czartoryski Palace, dating from 1676–1679 (architect Tylman van Gameren), burned in 1706, remodeled 1722–36, and again by Chrystian Piotr Aigner ca. 1800. The palace is surrounded by a 30-hectare park, in 1798-1806 fashioned into an English landscape garden, which includes classicist park pavilions dating from the early 19th century. One, the colonnaded round Temple of the Sibyl, is the setting of Bolesław Prus&#x27; striking 1884 micro-story, &quot;Mold of the Earth.&quot;

Near the Temple of the Sibyl is the &quot;Gothic House&quot;, built between 1800 and 1809 to commemorate Prince Józef Poniatowski’s visit to Puławy; it now houses the Regional Museum. Other palace buildings house the Soil and Fertilizer Institute.

Additional interesting buildings within the park include:
* Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary (1800–03) by Chrystian Piotr Aigner, styled after the Pantheon, Rome, originally - Czartoryskis&#x27; Chapel. It is actually located outside the park.
* Marynka&quot;s Palace (1790–94), built for Maria Wirtemberska, 
* Roman Gate, built in 1829 as a permanent ruin, styled after the Arch of Titus,
* Greek House (1778–1791), currently a public library, 
* Yellow House, in which Tsar Alexander II of Russia stayed, 
* Chinese Arbor, 
* marble sarcophagus, brought from Rome in 1799 by Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, 
* a 1790 sculpture of Clorinda and Tancred (see Jerusalem Delivered).

The town of Puławy itself features some interesting buildings, including a former town hall, former Orthodox church, and historic inn.

<doc id="386891" wikidata="Q4154108" url="?curid=386891" title="Chinese pronouns">
<text>Chinese pronouns are pronouns in the Chinese languages. This article highlights Mandarin Chinese pronouns. There are also Cantonese pronouns and Hokkien pronouns.

Chinese pronouns differ somewhat from English pronouns and those of other Indo-European languages. For instance, there is no differentiation in the spoken language between &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot; and &quot;it&quot; (though a written difference was introduced after contact with the West), and pronouns are not inflected to indicate whether they are the subject or object of a sentence. Mandarin Chinese further lacks a distinction between the possessive adjective (&quot;my&quot;) and possessive pronoun (&quot;mine&quot;); both are formed by appending the particle &quot;de&quot;. Pronouns in Chinese are often substituted by honorific alternatives.

== Personal pronouns ==
=== In Mandarin ===

:* / can be either inclusive or exclusive, depending on the circumstance where it is used.
:† / is mainly used by northern speakers.

Following the iconoclastic May Fourth Movement in 1919, and to accommodate the translation of Western literature, written vernacular Chinese developed separate pronouns for gender-differentiated speech, and to address animals, deities, and inanimate objects.
Throughout the 1920s, a debate continued between three camps: those that preferred to preserve the preexisting use of without distinction between genders, those that wished to preserve the spoken non-gendered pronoun but introduce a new female pronoun in writing, and those that wished to introduce a differently pronounced female pronoun . The pronoun enjoyed widespread support in the 1920s and 1930s but lost out to after the Chinese Civil War. Currently, written pronouns are divided between the masculine human (he, him), feminine human (she, her), and non-human (it), and similarly in the plural. This distinction does not exist in the spoken language, where moreover &quot;tā&quot; is restricted to animate reference; inanimate entities are usually referred to with demonstrative pronouns for &#x27;this&#x27; (这/這 &quot;zhè&quot;) and &#x27;that&#x27; (那 &quot;nà&quot;).

Other, rarer new written pronouns in the second person are &quot;nǐ&quot; ( &quot;you, a deity&quot;), &quot;nǐ&quot; ( &quot;you, a male&quot;), and &quot;nǐ&quot; ( &quot;you, a female&quot;). In the third person, they are &quot;tā&quot; ( &quot;it, an animal&quot;), &quot;tā&quot; ( &quot;it, a deity&quot;), and &quot;tā&quot; ( &quot;it, an inanimate object&quot;). Among users of traditional Chinese characters, these distinctions are only made in Taiwanese Mandarin; in simplified Chinese, &quot;tā&quot; () is the only third-person non-human form and &quot;nǐ&quot; () is the only second person form. The third person distinction between &quot;he&quot; () and &quot;she&quot; () remain in use in all forms of written standard Mandarin.

In the early 21st century, some members of genderfluid and queer Chinese online communities started using X也 and TA to refer to a generic, anonymous, or non-binary third person. As of June 2022, neither have been encoded as a single code point in Unicode, and neither are considered standard usage. Since at least 2014, Bilibili has used TA in its user pages.

====Additional notes====
* The first-person pronouns &quot;ǎn&quot; and &quot;ǒu&quot; &quot;I&quot; are infrequently used in Mandarin conversation. They are of dialectal origin. However, their usage is gaining popularity among the young, most notably in online communications.
* According to Wang Li, the second person formal pronoun &quot;nín&quot; ( &quot;you, formal; polite&quot;) is derived from the fusion of the second person plural &quot;nǐmen&quot; ( &quot;you, formal; polite&quot;), making it somewhat analogous to the T-V distinction in Romance languages. Consistent with this hypothesized origin, &quot;*nínmen&quot; is traditionally considered to be a grammatically incorrect expression for the formal second person plural. Instead, the alternative phrases &quot;dàjiā&quot; (大家, &quot;you, formal plural&quot;) and &quot;gèwèi&quot; (各位, &quot;you, formal plural&quot;) are used, with the latter being somewhat more formal than the former. In addition, some dialects use an analogous formal third person pronoun &quot;tān&quot; (怹, &quot;he/she, formal; polite&quot;).
* Traditional Chinese characters, as influenced by translations from Western languages and the Bible in the nineteenth century, occasionally distinguished gender in pronouns, although that distinction is abandoned in simplified Characters. Those traditional characters developed after Western contact include both masculine and feminine forms of &quot;you&quot; ( and ). In the simplified system, is rare.

=== In other Sinitic languages ===
There are many other pronouns in modern Sinitic languages, such as Taiwanese Hokkien () &quot;you&quot; and Written Cantonese (keúih deih) &quot;they.&quot; There exist many more pronouns in Classical Chinese and in literary works, including (rǔ) or (ěr) for &quot;you&quot;, and (wú) for &quot;I&quot; (see Chinese honorifics). They are not routinely encountered in colloquial speech.

== Possessives ==
To indicate alienable possession, (&quot;de&quot;) is appended to the pronoun. For inalienable possession, such as family and entities very close to the owner, this may be omitted, e.g. (&quot;wǒ mā&quot;) &quot;my mother&quot;. For older generations, (&quot;lìng&quot;) is the equivalent to the modern form (&quot;nínde&quot;), as in (&quot;lìngzūn&quot;) &quot;your father&quot;. In literary style, (&quot;qí&quot;) is sometimes used for &quot;his&quot; or &quot;her&quot; or as a gender-neutral pronoun; e.g. means &quot;his father&quot; or &quot;her father&quot;.

In Cantonese, for possessive, (&quot;ge3&quot;) is appended to the pronoun. It is used in the same way as in Mandarin.

In Taiwanese Hokkien, possessive pronouns are homophonous with plural pronouns. For example, () can mean either &quot;your&quot; or &quot;you (plural)&quot;.

==Demonstrative pronouns==

The demonstrative pronouns work the same as in English.

The distinction between singular and plural are made by the classifier (gè) and (xiē), and the following nouns remain the same. Usually inanimate objects are referred using these pronouns rather than the personal pronouns (tā) and (tāmen). Traditional forms of these pronouns are: (zhège), (zhèxiē), (nàge), (nàxiē), and tāmen.

==Interrogative pronouns==

==Indefinite pronouns==
==Pronouns in imperial times==

:&quot;See also Chinese honorifics.&quot;

In imperial times, the pronoun for &quot;I&quot; was commonly omitted when speaking politely or to someone with higher social status. &quot;I&quot; was usually replaced with special pronouns to address specific situations. Examples include &quot;guǎrén&quot; () during early Chinese history and &quot;zhèn&quot; () after the Qin dynasty when the Emperor is speaking to his subjects. When the subjects speak to the Emperor, they address themselves as &quot;chén&quot; (), or &quot;your official&quot;. It was extremely impolite and taboo to address the Emperor as &quot;you&quot; or to refer to oneself as &quot;I&quot;.

In modern times, the practice of self-deprecatory terms is still used in specific formal situations. In résumés, the term &quot;guì&quot; (; lit. &quot;noble&quot;) is used for &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot;; e.g., &quot;guì gōngsī&quot; () refers to &quot;your company&quot;. Běnrén (; lit. &quot;this person&quot;) is used to refer to oneself.

Rorschach is first mentioned in 850 as &quot;Rorscachun&quot;. In 947, Otto I granted the abbot of St. Gall the right to operate markets, mint coins and levy tariffs at Rorschach.

In 1489–90 the Rorschacher Klosterbruch or destruction of the abbey at Rorschach touched off the St. Gallen War. Following decades of conflict with the city of St. Gallen, in late 1480 Abbot Ulrich Rösch began planning to move the abbey away from the city of St. Gallen to Rorschach. By moving he hoped to escape the independence and conflict in the city. Additionally, by moving closer to the important lake trade routes, he could make Rorschach into a major harbor and collect a fortune in taxes. In turn Mayor Varnbüler and the city feared that a new harbor on the lake would cause trade to bypass St. Gallen and Appenzell. They would then be forced to go through the Prince-Bishop&#x27;s harbor to sell their fabric. Though the city of St. Gallen and Appenzell opposed the new monastery, after the approval of Pope Sixtus IV and protracted negotiations with Emperor Friedrich III the corner stone of the new Mariaberg Abbey was laid on 21 March 1487.

At first the city simply protested the Abbot&#x27;s plan, but when that went nowhere, they began planning an attack on the abbey. They believed that the Swiss Confederation would not intervene due to tensions between them and the Swabian League. On 28 July 1489 a group of 1200 Appenzellers and 350 St. Galleners assembled at Grub (now part of Eggersriet) and marched on the Abbey. They quickly tore down the walls and burned everything they could find. After spending the night drinking and feasting on the abbot&#x27;s supplies, they returned to their homes. The attack cost the Abbot the 13,000 gulden he had already spent on construction along with an additional 3,000 in furniture and supplies. The Abbey&#x27;s vassals were supportive of the actions of the city and Appenzell and on 21 October 1489 signed the &quot;Waldkircher Bund&quot; with the rebels.

The Abbot spent the following months seeking support from his allies in the Old Swiss Confederation to punish St. Gallen and Appenzell. Initially he had little success. While the four allied cantons (Zürich, Lucerne, Schwyz and Glarus) generally supported the Abbot, the remainder of the Confederacy did not. However, the creation of the Waldkircher Bund appeared threatening to the Confederation and moved it to support the Abbot. On 24 January 1490, the Confederacy allowed the four cantons to attack the city and Appenzell. Facing forces from the Confederation, the Waldkircher Bund dissolved as each group prepared to defend themselves. The Swiss army besieged St. Gallen on 11 or 12 February and on 15 February the city surrendered. The peace treaty dissolved the Bund, restored the abbot&#x27;s lands, allowed him to rebuild Mariaburg Abbey but required him to remain in St. Gallen. Mariaberg Monastery was rebuilt starting in 1497 and completed 1518. But it only served the monastery of St. Gallen as an administrative center and later became a school.

<text>Rhino Entertainment Company (formerly Rhino Records Inc.) is an American specialty record label and production company founded in 1978. It is currently the catalog division for Warner Music Group. Its current CEO is Mark Pinkus.

==History==
Founded in 1978, Rhino was originally a novelty and reissue label during the 1970s and 1980s. It released compilation albums of pop, rock &amp; roll, and rhythm &amp; blues successes from the 1950s through the 1980s, as well as novelty-song LPs (compiled in-house or by Dr. Demento) and retrospectives of famous comedy performers, including Richard Pryor, Stan Freberg, Tom Lehrer, and Spike Jones.

Rhino started as a record shop on Westwood Boulevard, Los Angeles, in 1973, run by Richard Foos, and became a record distributor five years later thanks to the effort of then-store manager Harold Bronson. Their early releases were mostly novelty records (such as their first single, in 1975, Wild Man Fischer&#x27;s &quot;Go to Rhino Records&quot;). The difficulties involved in getting airplay and distribution for such material eventually caused Foos and Bronson to take the label in other directions. One of Rhino&#x27;s early artists was The Twisters, whose Los Angeles popularity far exceeded their album sales. Rhino&#x27;s mail-order catalogs and early LP labels featured the company&#x27;s mascot character Rocky—a cartoon greaser rhinoceros wearing a black leather jacket, designed by bootleg cover artist William Stout, and later cartoonist Scott Shaw!.
 
Some of the label&#x27;s earliest successes with re-issues were achieved by acquiring the rights to the White Whale Records catalog that included the Turtles. By the mid-1980s, most of Rhino&#x27;s releases were re-issues of previously released recordings licensed from other companies. For superior sound quality, audio mastering of the original tapes (where possible) was done under the direction of Bill Inglot, and the label&#x27;s creative packaging made Rhino one of the most respected re-issue record labels, receiving rave reviews from music collectors, fans, and historians; and later, Grammy nominations and awards. Rhino was quick to get into the compact disc market, releasing dozens of oldies CDs at the dawn of the CD age in 1984. Their retrospective compact disc releases, such as those in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Hits series (&quot;Billboard Top Dance Hits&quot;), are often remastered to restore or improve upon the releases&#x27; original analog audio quality.

In the late 1980s, Rhino transitioned into a complete entertainment company specializing in home video (initially VHS, then DVD and Blu-ray) reissues of television programs such as &quot;The Monkees&quot;, &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;The Transformers&quot;, &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, and &quot;Ed Sullivan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Classics&quot; collection, as well as compact disc releases of select artists and movie soundtracks.

Through the 1980s and 1990s, the company&#x27;s head of A&amp;R, Gary Stewart, signed artists who recorded new music, including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Steve Wynn, Rank and File, Gene Clark and Carla Olson, The Textones, and NRBQ. These albums were released on the main Rhino label and on subsidiary labels such as RNA (Rhino New Artists) and Forward. However, the company&#x27;s artists tended to generate more critical acclaim than public interest; for the most part, sales totals in the low five figures or less were routine for Rhino-produced albums, and the less costly, less risky re-issue business remained the company&#x27;s primary revenue stream. One exception was the success of &quot;At This Moment&quot; by Billy Vera and the Beaters, a 1981 song that went to the top of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in late 1986 after being featured in an episode of the hit NBC TV series &quot;Family Ties&quot;. In 1986, Rhino Records had signed a deal with New World Pictures to set up a feature film company called Rhino Films. The first project planned by Rhino Films was to be a film about the rock band Big Daddy, which was a Rhino group that was returned to the US after several years of absence.

In 1985, Rhino signed a six-year distribution agreement with Capitol Records. During 1989 Rhino and Capitol&#x27;s parent EMI made a deal to jointly acquire Roulette Records; Rhino received the U.S. rights to Roulette&#x27;s catalog, excluding jazz. When the distribution deal with Capitol ended in 1992, Rhino signed a new distribution deal with Atlantic Records, and in turn Time Warner bought a 50 percent stake in the record company. In 1993, Rhino&#x27;s home video unit ended its deal with Uni and moved its deal to A*Vision Entertainment. In 1998, Time Warner bought the other half of Rhino, making the company a wholly owned unit of Time Warner. The Rhino Records retail store, which was part of the 50% sale in 1992 but which reverted to Foos after Time Warner bought out the remainder, closed in 2005.

It was through this merger that the label reissued material from such artists as the Monkees, Eric Burdon, Fanny, Dannii Minogue, the Ramones, the Grateful Dead, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, the Beach Boys, Yes, the Doobie Brothers, the Cars, Chicago, Tom Paxton, Third Eye Blind, the Doors, War, Spirit of the West and, most recently, the Bee Gees; as well as soundtracks spanning the Turner-owned pre-1986 MGM and pre-1950 Warner Bros. periods, in addition to WB&#x27;s own post-1949 period. Rhino&#x27;s soundtrack releases include &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, &quot;King Kong&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Finian&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. The Turner Entertainment and Warner Bros. film soundtrack libraries are currently managed by Warner Bros.&#x27; in-house label subsidiary, WaterTower Music.

In 1999, Rhino started the &#x27;Rhino Handmade&#x27; division of limited-edition releases available primarily from their website. All Handmade deluxe editions were limited to about 3,000 copies or fewer, and once sold out were not re-pressed. In 2003, co-founders and longtime executives Richard Foos and Harold Bronson left Rhino, reportedly due to frustration with the challenges of an increasingly competitive market. In fact, Time Warner&#x27;s final vesting of its 100 percent ownership of the label, and its subsequent &#x27;reorganization&#x27; of label staff, which did not stop at the former owners, were the major factors in their exits. Soon after, Foos inaugurated a new label, Shout! Factory, which began releasing dozens of CDs and videos mirroring the original early-1990s Rhino philosophy.

In 2004, Time Warner spun off its music divisions and today Rhino is part of the newly organized Warner Music Group.

In addition to dealing with archive material, the label also manages the U.S. distribution or worldwide production of compilations for more recent Warner acts, including still-active artists such as Enya, New Order, and Chicago.

In June 2006, Warner Strategic Marketing in the U.K. was dissolved and Rhino Records U.K. was formed. The division has two main factions: TV-advertised compilations (for example &quot;Pure Garage Rewind Back to the Old School&quot;) and catalog material from the Warner vaults. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s 2007 release &quot;Mothership&quot; and the soundtrack to the film &quot;Juno&quot; are among the label&#x27;s successes.

In 2013, WMG acquired certain EMI assets divested by Universal Music Group including Parlophone and worldwide rights to Roulette Records. Those assets are now managed by Rhino.

==Street Jams==
&quot;Street Jams&quot; is a series of compilation albums issued by Rhino Entertainment between 1992 and 1994. The albums catalogue a number of influential old school hip hop and electro 12&quot; singles that were released in the early to mid-1980s.

While a few of the singles are early releases from Hip-Hop artists who would go on to greater success later on in the decade such as Run-DMC and Slick Rick, the majority of the tracks in the series are considered one-hit wonders by acts who have fallen into relative obscurity but that had a profound impact upon the Hip-Hop/electro scene of the 1980s and influenced some of the more well known artists of that time.

<doc id="386897" wikidata="Q224382" url="?curid=386897" title="Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro">
<text>Thomas Wilde, 1st Baron Truro, (7 July 178211 November 1855) was a British lawyer, judge, and politician. He was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain between 1850 and 1852.

==Background and education==
Born in London, Truro was the second son of Thomas Wilde, an attorney, and founder of Wilde Sapte, by his wife, Mary Anne (née Knight). He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School and was admitted as an attorney in 1805. 

He was the younger brother of Sir John Wylde and the uncle of James Wilde, 1st Baron Penzance.

==Legal and political career==
Wilde subsequently entered the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1817, having practised for two years before as a special pleader. Retained for the defence of Queen Caroline in 1820, he distinguished himself by his cross-examination and laid the foundation of an extensive common law practice. In 1824, he was made Serjeant-at-Law, and in 1827 King&#x27;s Serjeant.

He first entered parliament in the Whig interest as a member for Newark (1831–1832 and 1835–1841), afterwards representing Worcester (1841–1846). He was appointed Solicitor General in 1839, knighted in 1840, and became Attorney General in succession to Sir John Campbell in 1841. In 1846 he was appointed Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, an office he held until 1850 when he became Lord Chancellor and was created Baron Truro of Bowes in the County of Middlesex. He held this latter office until the fall of the Russell ministry in 1852.

==Family==

Lord Truro first married Mary Devaynes in 1813 (the widow of William Devaynes (1730–1809) and daughter of William Wileman). They had three surviving children. After Mary died in 1840, he married Augusta Emma d&#x27;Este, daughter of Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex and a first cousin of Queen Victoria, on 13 August 1845. There were no children from this marriage. Lord Truro died in London in November 1855, aged 76. He was succeeded in the barony by his second but eldest surviving son, Charles. Lady Truro died in May 1866, aged 64.

Thomas Wilde is commemorated by a Blue plaque erected on the front of 2 Kelvin Avenue Bowes Park London N13 which reads: 
&quot;Site of Bowes Manor 
THOMAS WILDE
1st BARON TRURO
1782 – 1855
LORD CHANCELLOR
1850 – 1852
LIVED HERE&quot;

Wilde also lived at Truro House, Broomfield Park, Palmers Green London N13, a Grade II listed building that dates back to 1673.

<text>Świebodzin (; ) is a town in western Poland with 20,744 inhabitants (2024). It is the capital of Świebodzin County in Lubusz Voivodeship.

Świebodzin is an important transportation hub, lying at the crossroads of the Polish national roads 2 and 3. The A2 motorway and S3 expressway cross near the town. Świebodzin is located northeast of Zielona Góra, one of the two voivodeship&#x27;s capitals, northwest of Wrocław and west of Poznań; east of the German border and east of Berlin. The crowned statue of Christ in Świebodzin, completed in November 2010, is one of the world&#x27;s tallest statues of Jesus.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The town&#x27;s name derives from the Polish personal name &quot;Świeboda&quot;, related to &quot;swoboda&quot; meaning &quot;freedom&quot;. The area was part of Poland from the time of the state&#x27;s creation in the 10th century. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, it initially was part of Greater Poland, and later it was part of Silesia. The earliest historical records which mention &quot;Sebusianis, Sipusius Silesius, Suebosian, Soebosian, Suebusianus&quot; for today&#x27;s Świebodzin date from the beginning of the 14th century, when the area belonged to the Lower Silesian Polish-ruled Duchy of Głogów. The town sprang up at the intersection of the old trade routes linking Silesia with Pomerania and a branch of the route running from Lusatia to Poznań in Greater Poland and further to Pomerelia. Initially, the town was probably a defensive fortification, built on the western banks of Lake Zamecko at a slight elevation. The town wall was ringed by settlements, which were much later incorporated into the city itself.

In 1319 the Brandenburg margrave Waldemar of Ascania conquered Świebodzin and the town of Sulechów to its south. He died in the same year and the territory fell back to the Silesian Piasts, who in 1329 became vassals of Bohemia, an Electorate of the Holy Roman Empire. When in 1476 Duke Henry XI of Głogów died without issue, fights over his succession broke out between Duke Jan II the Mad of Żagań and the Brandenburg Elector Albert III Achilles of Hohenzollern, who in ca.1479 was able to acquire the northern part of the duchy with the towns of Crossen (Krosno Odrzańskie) and Züllichau (Sulechów), which were incorporated into the Neumark district of Brandenburg in 1537. The area of Świebodzin however remained a Bohemian fief, becoming an exclave of the Silesian crown land which in 1526 passed with the Bohemian Kingdom to the Habsburg monarchy.

===Early modern period===

Because of the town&#x27;s location at an important crossroads, it developed economically, particularly in the areas of commerce and craft production. In the 15th century and particularly in the 16th century, Schwiebus was known for manufacturing beer and exporting cloth. It also developed various urban handicrafts and manufactured goods for local purposes (the weekly market). The salt, wool, grain, horse, and beef trades were also important.
For a time the Schwiebus territory was granted by the emperor to Brandenburg-Prussia. Representatives of well-known Silesian families, including the von Knobelsdorffs, among others, held authority and power in the town as district starosts and castle commanders on behalf of the Habsburgs.

Because of its position near the Holy Roman Empire&#x27;s border with the Kingdom of Poland, the town most likely had a population of mixed Polish and German descent at this time, but Germans were the majority by the early modern period. During the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries, the town expanded economically, spatially, and demographically, in spite of local conflicts and the turbulent Protestant Reformation and Counter-Reformation.

After the victory of King Frederick II of Prussia in the First Silesian War (1740–1742), Schwiebus came under Prussian administration. In 1817 its territory was merged with the southern Züllichau region to form the Züllichau-Schwiebus District in the Province of Brandenburg. Schwiebus remained in this territorial form until 1945. Annexation by Prussia brought about a sharp economic crisis, as the tradesmen of Schwiebus were cut off from many of their traditional markets and outlets. The Prussian authorities also increased local taxes while limiting the town&#x27;s autonomy. The period of revolutions and Napoleonic wars brought about a depression in the cloth trade and limited the economic prospects of the town.

The town&#x27;s extended stagnation ended with the Stein-Hardenberg economic reforms and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-19th century. As a medium-sized town and hub of the local market, lying at the intersection of several routes of communication, including the new Frankfurt (Oder)-Poznań railway line, Schwiebus became a center of local industry (textile, machinery, and agricultural food processing). The town was modernized at this time with improved traffic arteries, renovation of the town hall, reconstruction of the church of St. Michael, and the construction of several new public service buildings (law courts, high school, gas works, and post office). Schwiebus contributed to and benefited from the economic expansion of the German Empire in the years before 1914.

===20th century===

A new period of economic stagnation began with the territorial changes in central Europe after Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I. In the interwar period, Schwiebus found itself in the eastern outskirts of Germany, twenty kilometers west of the newly imposed German-Polish border. During the 1920s, Weimar Germany experienced two major economic crises, the hyperinflation of the early 1920s and the Great Depression beginning in 1929. The citizens of Schwiebus suffered severe economic hardship during this time. As was the case elsewhere in Germany, many of the town&#x27;s citizens were dissatisfied with their lot and turned to political extremism.

Adolf Hitler of the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933. Hitler quickly moved to consolidate and expand his power, adopting severe repressive measures against his political opposition and the German Jewish minority. However, Hitler remained popular with the public because he oversaw the German economic recovery of the 1930s. The new government sponsored many public works programs and a massive rearmament campaign which included the construction of an extensive fortified line of bunkers, &quot;Ostwall&quot; (today known as the Międzyrzecz Fortified Region) twenty kilometers north of Schwiebus.

During World War II, Nazi Germany operated a forced labour camp for Jews in the town. The war first brought hardship to Schwiebus and then total disaster. In early January 1945, the Soviet Red Army began its final advance through Poland into eastern Germany, reaching Schwiebus before the end of the month. By this time, many of its inhabitants had already fled, fearing the Soviet revenge for the atrocities perpetrated by the German occupation forces against the civilian population of the Soviet Union. The town was largely spared from destruction during the fighting, as the bulk of the Soviet forces passed to the north and south on their way to Berlin. It was finally captured on 31 January 1945. The capture was not without casualties.

After Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, the town became again part of Poland, although with a Soviet-imposed communist economic system, which enacted sweeping social, economic, and political reforms. Świebodzin&#x27;s economic recovery was also hampered by the Soviet policy of dismantling industrial facilities in conquered areas, and shipping components back to the Soviet Union. In this way, Świebodzin lost some of its prewar industries, particularly its breweries.

Świebodzin expanded in the period under communist rule, and its population doubled. New neighborhoods were built to the south of the railway line, composed largely of pre-fabricated apartment buildings. The Communist Economic Planning Commissions chose to develop the electromechanical, furniture, and timber industries in Świebodzin. Products were exported throughout Poland and to the other states in the Soviet Bloc.

Świebodzin was formerly part of the Zielona Góra Voivodeship (1975–1998). Since the Local Government Reorganization Act of 1998, it has been part of Lubusz Voivodeship.

However, with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and the revolutions of 1989, Świebodzin once again experienced economic upheaval. With some difficulties, the local economy was adapted to the international market economy. New industries and businesses were established, but others were unable to compete in the new environment and went bankrupt. Many more goods became available in local shops, but at prices that many inhabitants could not afford. In recent years, a few foreign-owned discount supermarkets, pizzerias, hotels, and other businesses have been established in the town, taking advantage of the proximity of Poland&#x27;s main east–west motorway. With the economic changes there have also been political changes. Since the restoration of free elections in 1989 the city council&#x27;s former communist control has been replaced by democratic parties.

==Attractions and sites of interest==
The center of Świebodzin still contains remnants of the town&#x27;s past as a medieval walled settlement, including two nearly intact towers and fragments of the town&#x27;s defensive walls and bastions. The central market square is dominated by the town hall, built around 1550 in the renaissance style and rebuilt in the 19th century with the addition of its prominent clock tower. The town hall still contains its original gothic vaults in the rooms of the Regional Museum and basement cafe. There are two large churches in the town center, the Church of St. Michael the Archangel and the Church of the Mother of God. The Church of St. Michael was first built in the second half of the 15th Century, and its neo-gothic façade was added in the second half of the 19th century. The neo-gothic Church of the Mother of God was built during the Imperial German period as a Protestant Church but was reconsecrated as a Catholic Church after World War II.

In the summer of 2008, assembly of the &quot;Christ the King&quot;, a giant statue of a crowned Jesus Christ, began on a hill on the outskirts of the town. Intended to serve as a future site of pilgrimage, the statue was completed in November 2010, and is claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest statue of Jesus, although if the crown is excluded the &quot;Cristo de la Concordia&quot; in Bolivia is still taller. Construction was funded by donations from local people and as far away as Canada. The existence of the statue has seen fellow Poles referring to the town jokingly as &quot;Rio de Świebodzineiro&quot;.

==Sport==
Świebodzin has a table tennis club KS Jofrakuda Świebodzin which is playing in 3.liga (Polish third division). The club has also the other teams playing in lower divisions of Lubusz. The club is known from a successful work with young table tennis players, who are highly ranked in Polish youth categories.

<doc id="386899" wikidata="Q158459" url="?curid=386899" title="Żagań">
<text>Żagań (French and , ) is a town in western Poland, on the Bóbr river, with 25,731 inhabitants (2019), capital of Żagań County in the Lubusz Voivodeship, located in the historic region of Lower Silesia.

Founded in the 12th century by Polish monarch Bolesław IV the Curly, Żagań was the capital of an eponymous principality from 1274 to 1935. The main sights are the former Augustinian Monastery, one of the burial sites of the Piast dynasty, listed as a Historic Monument of Poland, the Ducal Palace and Park ensemble and the POW Camps Museum, located at the site of German-operated WWII prisoner-of-war camps for over 60,000 Allied soldiers of various nationalities, where the &quot;Great Escape&quot; took place.

The town hosts the Polish 11th Armoured Cavalry Division. An American Armored Brigade Combat Team is constantly rotated through the town under Operation Atlantic Resolve.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name probably means &quot;place of the burnt forest&quot; (, ), probably referring to the burning of primeval forest by early settlers. If this is correct, it is consistent with the names of nearby places Żary, Zgorzelec, and Pożarów.

==Geography==
Żagań is located roughly halfway between Cottbus and Wrocław, approximately 100 meters above sea level and at the centre of the Żagań administrative district. It is about north of the Polish border with the Czech Republic, and approximately to the east of Poland&#x27;s border with Germany. The rural district of Żagań surrounds the town on its northern, eastern and southern sides. Iłowa lies to the south-west and the rural district of Żary is to the north-west. The Rivers Bóbr and Kwisa meet up just outside the town on its south-eastern side.

==History==
===Polish Piast dynasty===

The area formed part of Poland after the creation of the state in the 10th century. Żagań was founded in the 12th century by Polish monarch Bolesław IV the Curly near an old settlement of the same name, which name was then changed to Stary Żagań (&quot;Old Żagań&quot;). The name comes from the Old Polish word &quot;zagon&quot;. It was first mentioned in a 1202 deed, when it belonged to the Duchy of Silesia under the rule of the Piast duke Henry I the Bearded, within fragmented Poland. In 1251, it became part of the newly created Duchy of Głogów under Henry&#x27;s grandson Konrad I. Duke Konrad I granted Żagań town rights between 1248 and 1260. The town developed wealth from development of mining, and attracted German settlers from the west.

After Konrad&#x27;s death in 1274, his heirs again divided the duchy and the castle of Żagań became the residence of his youngest son Przemko of Ścinawa, Duke of Żagań from 1278, who established a monastery of the Augustinian Canons here. Thus the Duchy of Żagań came into the existence. In 1284, he swapped his estates for the Duchy of Ścinawa and was succeeded by his elder brother Konrad II the Hunchback. When Konrad II died in 1304, all the former Głogów estates were reunified under his surviving brother Henry III.
In 1309, Henry III of Głogów was succeeded by his eldest son Henry IV the Faithful, who in 1321 again had to divide the duchy with his younger brothers. He ceded Głogów to Przemko II and retired to Żagań, which again became the capital of a duchy in its own right. In 1329, all the sons of Henry III of Głogów became vassals of John of Luxembourg, the King of Bohemia - with the exception of Przemko II who died suddenly two years later. When in 1393 Henry VI the Elder, grandson of Henry IV, died without issue, the estates were again reunified with Głogów until in 1412 Jan I, the eldest son of Duke Henry VIII the Sparrow, became the sole ruler of the Żagań duchy.

===Saxon, Habsburg and Prussian rule===
After a fierce battle for the inheritance, Jan II the Mad, son of Jan I, finally sold it to Duke Albert III of Saxony from the House of Wettin, thus ending the centuries-long Piast rule.

In 1549, Elector Maurice of Saxony ceded Sagan to the Bohemian king Ferdinand I of Habsburg. Emperor Ferdinand II of Habsburg allotted the fief to Albrecht von Wallenstein, his supreme commander in the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1627. It then passed to the illustrious Bohemian family of Lobkowicz, who had the Baroque Żagań Palace erected. One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland traveled that route numerous times. After the First Silesian War of 1742, Żagań became part of Prussia. It was part of the Province of Silesia of Prussia and after 1871 Germany. In the 19th century Żagań was still a significant Polish center.

In 1786, the fief was purchased by Peter von Biron, Duke of Courland, and in 1843, it passed to his daughter Dorothea, the wife of Edmond de Talleyrand, a nephew of the great French diplomat Talleyrand, who spent her retirement years at Sagan. A patent of King Frederick William IV of Prussia on 6 January 1845 invested her as Duchess of Sagan; and Napoleon III recognized the title in France, in favour of her son Louis.

===Second World War===
The double title (a &quot;prince&quot; and a &quot;duc&quot;) both Prussian and French, served to render the &quot;duc de Sagan&quot; a neutral party during the Second World War: his Château de Valençay provided a safe haven for treasures of the Louvre during the German occupation of France.

During the war, the Germans operated two prisoner-of-war camps and a forced labour camp in the town, all intended for prisoners of various nationalities. Sagan was occupied by Soviet troops during the third week of February 1945, following several days of savage fighting.

====Prisoner of war camps and &quot;The Great Escape&quot;====
As early as 1939, soon after invading Poland, Nazi Germany established a system of prisoner of war (POW) camps in Sagan. In total, the &quot;Mannschafts-Stammlager Stalag VIIIC&quot; and its subsidiaries held over 300,000 prisoners from some 30 different countries. It is estimated that around 120,000 of them died of hunger, disease and maltreatment. Later, in 1942, an additional camp was set up for Allied pilots, called &quot;Stalag Luft III&quot;. 

In March 1942, the town became the location of the &quot;Stalag Luft III&quot; camp for captured airmen (Kriegsgefangenen Stammlager der Luftwaffe 3 Sagan). It was the site of the most courageous escape resulting in the killing of 50 prisoners including the following Polish flight officers: Major Antoni Kiewnarski; Lieutenant Stanisław Król; and navigation Lieutenants Włodzimierz Kolanowski, Jerzy Mondschein, Kazimierz Pawluk and Paweł Tobolski. This episode of history was the subject of the 1963 film &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, starring Steve McQueen. It was the biggest and the most deadly escape of officer aircrew captured by Nazi Germany during the entire war. The number of prisoners attempting the escape was 200, of whom 76 managed to leave the camp; 73 were caught and 50 executed on Hitler&#x27;s orders. Just three successfully escaped, one to Gibraltar and two to Sweden. All three reunited in England.

There were only a few other, similar escapes from German POW camps during the Second World War. A slightly smaller one on March 6, 1943, from Oflag XXI-B in Szubin, involved 43 British officers. On September 19–20, 1943, an escape from the &quot;Oflag VI B&quot; in Dössel near Wartburg involved 47 Polish officers. A day later 67 French officers escaped from Edelbach in Austria. Another involved 54 French soldiers on December 18, 1943, from Marlag near Hamburg.

===Modern Poland===

After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat, the town became again part of Poland as the result of the border changes decided at the Potsdam Conference. The totality of the town&#x27;s population was expelled, and the town was repopulated by Poles, many displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

Clearing the rubble began in 1947, and was followed by the establishment of small enterprises, factories and schools. During the 1970s, a &quot;new town&quot; quarter was built, and by 1983, the historic baronial château (&quot;Żagań Palace&quot;) had been fully rebuilt.

For many years regiments of the Soviet Air Forces flew from the town&#x27;s airbase (Żagań-Tomaszowo?). In 1992 the 42nd Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment finally left and was disbanded after a brief stay at Szprotawa.

In the years 1967–1971 a museum dedicated to the history of prisoners of war of the Stalag VIII-C camp was established. From 1975 to 1998, Żagań was administratively located in the Zielona Góra Voivodeship. In 2011, the former Augustinian monastery complex with the church of the Assumption was designated a Historic Monument of Poland. In 2013, the first Polish monument of Wojtek the Bear, soldier of the Polish II Corps during World War II, was unveiled in Żagań.

<text>Nowa Sól is a city on the Oder River in Lubusz Voivodeship, western Poland. It is the capital of Nowa Sól County and had a population of 38,763 (2019).

==History==
The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century, and following the country&#x27;s fragmentation it formed part of the Duchy of Głogów since 1251, ruled by the Piast and Jagiellonian dynasties, including future Polish Kings John I Albert and Sigismund I the Old. The first mention of the settlement in the region of modern Nowa Sól dates back to the 14th century. The Latin book &quot;Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis&quot; (Polish: &quot;Księga uposażeń biskupstwa wrocławskiego&quot;) records two Slavic Polish settlements of Stare Żabno mentioned as &quot;Sczhabna antiqua&quot; and Nowe Żabno as &quot;Sczhabna nova&quot;. The former is currently a suburb of Nowa Sól and the latter still exists as a village. In 1506, the territory was incorporated into the Kingdom of Bohemia, part of the Holy Roman Empire.

In order to break Silesia&#x27;s dependency on salt from Poland, Emperor Ferdinand I founded the demesne land &quot;Zum Neuen Saltze&quot; in 1563. The sea salt, originally from La Rochelle and the Iberian coast, was transported from Hamburg and Stettin (Szczecin) along the navigable Oder. A flood in 1573 led to the relocation of the salt refinery to the nearby village of Modritz (Modrzyca); the office of the administrator is now the town hall. The settlement was documented as &quot;Neusalzburg&quot; (&quot;New Salzburg&quot;) in 1585 and later as &quot;Neusalz&quot; (&quot;New Salt&quot;). A trading harbor was built on the Oder in 1592. The Protestant Church of St. Michael, built from 1591 to 1597, was converted to Roman Catholicism in 1654.
The entrance of Dutch and English merchants in the Baltic Sea at the end of the 16th century led to difficulties in the supply of unrefined salt. The unprofitable enterprise was also hampered by tolls on the Oder imposed by the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Salt refining in Neusalz nearly collapsed during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–48), while recovery was hampered by the salt trade of Brandenburg and Poland afterwards. As the rulers of Swedish Pomerania, Sweden prevented salt from reaching the town from Stettin in 1710. Three years later Neusalz became an outpost for salt from Magdeburg and Halle.

Neusalz developed into one of the largest ports on the Silesian Oder and handled the majority of salt traffic on the river. It was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 according to the Treaty of Breslau. When King Frederick II of Prussia granted Neusalz town rights on 9 October 1743 and initiated plans to expand the town, it had 97 houses. A colony of the Moravian Church was founded in 1744. After the Battle of Kunersdorf, Neusalz was plundered on 24 September 1759. Forty houses were burnt down, as was the Moravian community, which was restored in 1763.
Neusalz was administered within Landkreis Freystadt i. Niederschles. in Prussian Silesia after the Napoleonic Wars. The modern industrial development began in the 19th century when new factories, especially linen factories and steelworks, were opened. Neusalz was first connected to the Silesian railway in 1871, the same year the town became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany. Expansion and modernization of the harbor began on 11 October 1897. Neusalz became part of the Prussian Province of Lower Silesia in 1919. A wooden bridge across the Oder, originally built in 1870, was rebuilt using reinforced concrete in 1932.

During World War II the town was the site of a forced labor subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, whose prisoners were Jewish women from occupied Poland, Czechoslovakia and Germany. During the final stages of the war, in January 1945, remaining prisoners were sent on a German-perpetrated death march towards Krzystkowice, with one woman escaping and returning to the town, where she was then sheltered by remaining Polish forced laborers. German troops destroyed the concrete bridge on 9 February 1945, but the Soviet Red Army entered Neusalz on 13/14 February 1945. A number of buildings burnt down, including the Catholic Church.

Nowa Sól was rebuilt as an industrial and administrative center, superseding nearby Kożuchów. From 1975 to 1998 it was in the Zielona Gora Voivodeship, after which it became part of the Lubusz Voivodeship. The town is featured in the documentary &quot;5000 Miles&quot;, about a family from Wisconsin in the United States wishing to adopt a Polish child.

<text>Żary (, , , ) is a town in western Poland with 37,502 inhabitants (2019), situated in the Lubusz Voivodeship. It is the administrative seat of the Żary County and of the Gmina Żary within the county, though the town is not part of the gmina (commune).

Żary is located in the east of the historic Lower Lusatia region, in the borderland with the Silesian lowlands and Greater Poland, roughly outlined by the Bóbr and Oder rivers. The city is one of the biggest economic and tourist centers in the southern Lubuskie region and the largest town in the Polish part of Lusatia, and is also referred as its unofficial capital. The city, whose history dates back more than 1000 years, features many historic sites.

== History ==

The beginnings of settlement in the Żary area date back to prehistoric times. The name “Zara”, deriving most likely from a small, independent West Slavic tribe, appeared for the first time in 1007 in the chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg, after Duke Bolesław I Chrobry of Poland had conquered the Żary land along with Lusatia. Regained by Emperor Conrad II in 1031. In the early 13th century it was part of the Duchy of Silesia within fragmented Piast-ruled Poland. Lost by Poland, the town was chartered on the Magdeburg law by the Wettin margrave Henry III of Meissen about 1260. It covered the following three areas: a trade settlement on the “Salt Trail” running from Leipzig to Wrocław, a fortified town erected among bogs (in the area of the later castle), and a Franciscan settlement established in 1274.

The city was under the domain of the Polish Silesian Piasts until Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV in 1364 purchased Lower Lusatia and incorporated it into the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. In 1635 the town became part of the Electorate of Saxony per the Peace of Prague. The Saxon Electors also served as Kings of Poland in 1697–1706 and 1709–1763 and of the two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town at that time. Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland visited the town many times, including in 1705, 1718, 1730, 1748 and 1763. The royal cabinet minister Erdmann II of Promnitz built a new Baroque palace in the town.
After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Sorau fell to the Kingdom of Prussia, which in 1871 was united with other German states into the German Empire. The town&#x27;s prominent families included the Dewins, Packs, Bibersteins and Promnitzs, whose residence was the castle-palace complex.

Near the end of World War II, Soviet Red Army troops conquered the town on 13 February 1945. After the war, British and American representatives at the Potsdam Conference of July–August 1945 were initially unwilling to agree to Polish administration being extended as far west as Stalin demanded. After some negotiations, both the Soviet and Polish representatives indicated that they would be willing to concede a frontier along the historic Lusatian border with Silesia at the Oder-Bóbr-Kwisa rivers, which would have left Sorau in German territory. However, ultimately the town was transferred to Poland under extensive border changes promulgated at the conference. The German residents of Sorau were expelled, and the town was gradually repopulated by Poles, incl. those displaced from former Eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union.

Initially, from 1945 it was administratively located in the Lower Silesian/Wrocław Voivodeship, then from 1950 to 1975 in the &quot;larger&quot; Zielona Góra Voivodeship, and from 1975 to 1998, in the &quot;smaller&quot; Zielona Góra Voivodeship.

==Economy==
During World War II a branch of the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory was moved to the town. In April 1944, after a bombing raid of the Allies, some buildings of the Old Town were reduced to a heap of rubble.

Today Żary, which is a county seat, features headquarters of many offices and institutions, used by residents of this part of the region, including the Tax Office, Social Insurance Institution, Employment Office, 8 bank branches, insurance companies, high schools, and the Lusatian Higher School of the Humanities.

Żary&#x27;s border area location has a significant influence on its economic growth. In the proximity of the city (20–40 km) there are Polish-German border crossings in Olszyna, Łęknica, Przewóz, and Zasieki as well as a railroad checkpoint in Forst. Żary is also an attractive tourist destination.

==Transport==

Two main national roads, no. 12 and 27 intersect in Żary. They run together on a stretch of the city bypass. Two of the three sections of the city bypass that have been opened have significantly improved the traffic in the city. Construction of the bypass was subsidized by the Phare Fund. Presently, work continues on the last section of the bypass, which will be completed in 2005.

In the proximity of the city runs the international European route E36 from Berlin to Bolesławiec, which soon will be transformed into the A18 autostrada. On this road, near the border with Germany, from Żary, in nearby Olszyna there is one of the biggest cargo terminals in the country. Construction of the A18 and A4 highways is underway and should be completed by the end of 2010. The E36 on the German side is known as the Bundesautobahn 15 highway, providing a quick access to Berlin via a network of motorways. The international airports in Berlin are about away, about a one-and-a-half-hour drive away.

Inter-City trains travel from Berlin and Hamburg via Żary to Kraków. In a relatively short distance from Żary there are smaller airports in Babimost near Zielona Góra as well as in the German town of Rothenburg (about from the border crossing at Przewóz).

In Żary there are two telecommunication companies, having a great effect on the quality of provided service. The city has also good coverage of wireless service providers. It also has a fiber optic network that offers quick Internet access.

==Historical sites==

Despite significant war damage, many interesting architectural historic sites have been preserved in Żary, including its medieval municipal urban arrangement.

* In the northwest part of the city there is the Dewins-Packs-Bibersteins&#x27; Castle, a huge, 13th century structure, reconstructed later in the Renaissance style. It neighbors on the Baroque Promnitzs&#x27; Palace, which was designed by Swiss architect Giovanni Simonetti. Both residences, purchased by a private investor, continue to wait for renovation. They are surrounded by the remains of an old geometrical park, with a garden palace and the Blue Gate dating from 1708.
* The Gothic Sacred Heart Church towers above the Old Town. The church, which obtained its principal shape in the 15th century, remembers the times when the city was chartered; fragments of the wall in the northern wing date from the 13th century. Initially it was a Roman Catholic church, then a Protestant Lutheran church from 1524 to 1945, when it became a Roman Catholic church again. The Baroque Promnitz Chapel near the eastern wall was added in 1670–1672. In the vicinity of the church we can find a Gothic rectory and a Gothic-Renaissance building of the old commissariat. Today it houses a museum.
* The garrison Church under the invocation of the Elevation of the Holy Cross build in the turn of the 14th/15th centuries; originally the church of Grey Friars
* Church under the invocation of St. Peter and Paul (13th century) located in the former cemetery

* One of the main treasures of the Market Square is the newly renovated Town Hall dating from the turn of the 14th century, featuring a beautiful Renaissance portal. There are also tenement houses that surround the Market Square and some at Bolesława Chrobrego Street, which is a major commercial thoroughfare of the city. The oldest buildings date from the 17th century.
* The remains of the medieval fortifications of the city are fragments of walls, two defense towers (the taller one of the 14th/15th centuries, with ashlars made from meadow ore, has become a “landmark” of Żary), and a stone belfry from the turn of the 14th century.
* The Blue Gate build in 1708
* One of the tourist and natural attractions of the area is the “Green Forest” located near the southern border of the city, featuring the highest altitude in the Lubuski Region (227 m above sea level).

For six years rock music concerts called “Woodstock Stop Festival” have been organized in Żary.

Żary invites to its new complex of indoor swimming pools called “Wodnik”, featuring state-of-the-art fitness equipment. Other places in the city that offer pleasant atmosphere during meetings include myriad restaurants, cafes, and pubs. On the first Saturday of every month a flea market is held in the pedestrian precinct in Żary and the Exhibition Salon is located in the Żary pedestrian precinct near the Town Hall.

Thanks to an annual growth of revenues from local taxes and quick privatization of the municipal property, the community was able to finance several large-scale investment projects. The city has a sewage treatment plant with throughput of 15,000 cu. m per day, and a municipal landfill that meets the requirements of European standards. In 1998 a new water treatment plant was opened. Work continues on expansion of gas grid, heat distribution system, and water-sewage hookups.

In 2000 a large section of the bypass and a complex of indoor swimming pools were opened. Modernization of local roads is underway. In 2005 the last section of the bypass will be opened. Preparations continue on the revitalization of the Old Town of Żary. The pavement of the market square will soon be renovated. The projects of development of the town&#x27;s pedestrian zone, park and the former military area.

The communication arrangement of the town is being modernized and expenses are being appropriated for the educational infrastructure. The construction of the sports and showroom is underway and junior high schools and primary schools are being redecorated.

<text>A gaucho () or gaúcho () is a skilled horseman, reputed to be brave and unruly. The figure of the gaucho is a folk symbol of Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, the southern part of Bolivia, and the south of Chilean Patagonia. Gauchos became greatly admired and renowned in legend, folklore, and literature and became an important part of their regional cultural tradition. Beginning late in the 19th century, after the heyday of the gauchos, they were celebrated by South American writers.

According to the , in its historical sense a gaucho was a &quot;mestizo who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, inhabited Argentina, Uruguay, and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, and was a migratory horseman, and adept in cattle work&quot;. In Argentina and Uruguay today, gaucho can refer to any &quot;country person, experienced in traditional livestock farming&quot;. Because historical gauchos were reputed to be brave, if unruly, the word is also applied metaphorically to mean &quot;noble, brave and generous&quot;, but also &quot;one who is skillful in subtle tricks, crafty&quot;. In Portuguese the word gaúcho means &quot;an inhabitant of the plains of Rio Grande do Sul or the Pampas of Argentina of European and indigenous American descent who devotes himself to lassoing and raising cattle and horses&quot;; gaúcho has also acquired a metonymic signification in Brazil, meaning anyone, even an urban dweller, who is a citizen of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

==Etymology==
Many explanations have been proposed, but no-one really knows how the word &quot;gaucho&quot; originated. Already in 1933 an author counted 36 different theories; more recently, over fifty. They can proliferate because &quot;there is no documentation of any sort that will fix its origin to any time, place or language&quot;.

===Resemblance theories===
Most seem to have been conjured up by finding a word that looks something like &quot;gaucho&quot; and guessing that it changed to its present form, perhaps without awareness that there are sound laws that describe how languages and words really evolve over time. The etymologist Joan Corominas said most of these theories were &quot;not worthy of discussion&quot;. Of the following explanations, Rona said that only #5, #8 and #9 might be taken seriously.

===The dialect frontier theory===

A different approach is to consider that the word might have originated north of the Río de la Plata, where the indigenous languages were quite different and there is a Portuguese influence.
Two facts that any theory could usefully account for are: 
* The word actually exists in two forms: Port. &quot;gaúcho&quot; and Sp. &quot;gaucho&quot;, both long attested. 
* Gauchos are first mentioned by name in the Spanish colonial records for present-day Uruguay, often in connection with smuggling to Brazil (see below, Origins). Thus Azara wrote (around 1784):

Hence the Uruguayan sociolinguist José Pedro Rona thought the origin of the word was to be sought &quot;on the frontier zone between Spanish and Portuguese, which goes from northern Uruguay to the Argentine province of Corrientes and the Brazilian area between them&quot;.

Rona, himself born on a language frontier in pre-Holocaust Europe, was a pioneer of the concept of linguistic borders, and studied the dialects of northern Uruguay where Portuguese and Spanish intermingle. Rona thought that, of the two forms — &quot;gaúcho&quot; and &quot;gaucho&quot; — the former probably came first, because it was linguistically more natural for &quot;gaúcho&quot; to evolve by accent-shift to &quot;gáucho&quot;, than the other way round. Thus the problem came down to explaining the origin of &quot;gaúcho&quot;.
As to that, Rona thought that &quot;gaúcho&quot; originated in northern Uruguay, and came from &quot;garrucho&quot;, a derisive word possibly of Charrua origin, which meant something like &quot;old indian&quot; or &quot;contemptible person&quot;, and is actually found in the historical record. However in the Portuguese-based dialects of northern Uruguay the phoneme /rr/ is not easily pronounced, and so is rendered as /h/ (sounding rather like English h). Thus &quot;garrucho&quot; would be rendered as &quot;gahucho&quot;, and indeed the French naturalist Augustin Saint-Hilaire, travelling in Uruguay during the Artigas insurgency, wrote in his diary (16 October 1820): The native Spanish-speakers of these borderlands, however, could not process the phoneme /h/, and would render it as a null, thus &quot;gaúcho&quot;. In sum, according to this theory, &quot;gaúcho&quot; originated in the Uruguay-Brazil dialect borderlands, deriving from a derisive indigenous word &quot;garrucho&quot;, then in Spanish lands evolved by accent-shift to &quot;gaucho&quot;.

==History==
The historical &quot;gaucho&quot; is elusive, because there has been more than one kind. Mythologisation has obscured the topic.

===Origins===
Itinerant horsemen, hunting wild cattle on the pampas, originated as a social class during the 17th century. &quot;The great natural abundance of the pampa&quot;, wrote Richard W. Slatta, 

The original gaucho was typically descended from unions between Iberian men and Amerindian women, although he might also have African ancestry. A DNA analysis study of rural inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul, who style themselves &quot;gaúchos&quot;, has claimed to discern, not only Amerindian (Charrúa and Guaraní) ancestry in the female line but, in the male line, a higher proportion of Spanish ancestry than is usual in Brazil. However, gauchos were a social class, not an ethnic group.

Gauchos are first mentioned by name in the 18th century records of the Spanish colonial authorities who administered the Banda Oriental (present-day Uruguay). For them, he is an outlaw, cattle thief, robber and smuggler. Félix de Azara (1790) said gauchos were &quot;the dregs of the Rio de la Plata and of Brazil&quot;. Summarised one scholar: &quot;Fundamentally [the gaucho of the time] was a colonial bootlegger whose business was contraband trade in cattle hides. His work was highly illegal; his character lamentably reprehensible; his social standing exceedingly low.

&quot;Gaucho&quot; was an insult; yet it was possible to use the word to refer, without animosity, to country people in general. Furthermore the gaucho&#x27;s skills, though useful in banditry or smuggling, were just as useful for serving in the frontier police. The Spanish administration recruited its antismuggling Cuerpo de Blandengues from among the outlaws themselves. The Uruguayan patriot José Gervasio Artigas made precisely that career transition.

===Wars of emancipation; independence===

The gaucho was a born cavalryman, and his bravery in the patriot cause in the wars of independence, especially under Artigas and Martín Miguel de Güemes, earned admiration and improved his image. The Spanish general García Gamba, who fought against Güemes in Salta, said: Knowing &quot;gaucho&quot; to be an insult, the Spanish hurled it at the patriot militias; Güemes, however, picked it up as a badge of honour, referring to his troops as &quot;my gauchos&quot;.

Visitors to the newly emergent Argentina and Uruguay perceived that a &quot;gaucho&quot; was a country person or herdsman: seldom was there a pejorative significance. Emeric Essex Vidal, the first artist to paint gauchos, noted their mobility (1820):
Vidal also painted visiting gauchos from up-country Tucumán. (&quot;Their features are particularly Spanish, uncrossed by that mixture observable in the citizens of Buenos Ayres&quot;). They are not horsemen: they are oxcart drivers, and may or may not have called themselves gauchos in their home province.

Charles Darwin observed life on the pampas for six months and reflected in his diary (1833):

===Controlling the wandering gaucho===
====Argentina====


As cattle estates grew bigger the freely wandering gaucho became a nuisance to landed proprietors, except when his casual labour was wanted e.g. at branding. Furthermore his services were needed in the armies that were fighting on the Indian frontiers, or in the frequent civil wars.

Hence in Argentina, vagrancy laws required rural workers to carry employment documents. Some restrictions on the gaucho&#x27;s freedom of movement were imposed under Spanish Viceroy Sobremonte, but they were greatly intensified under Bernardino Rivadavia, and were enforced more vigorously still under Juan Manuel de Rosas. Those who did not carry the documentation could be sentenced to years in the military. From 1822 to 1873 even internal passports were required.

According to Marxist and other scholars the gaucho became &quot;proletarianized&quot;, preferring life as a salaried peon on an estancia to forced enlistment, irregular pay and harsh discipline. However, some resisted. &quot;In words and deeds, soldiers contested the state&#x27;s disciplinary model&quot;, frequently deserting. Deserters often fled to the Indian frontier, or even took refuge with the Indians themselves. José Hernández described the bitter fate of just such a gaucho protagonist in his poem Martín Fierro (1872), a great popular success in the countryside. One estimate was that renegade gauchos comprised half of all Indian raiding parties.

Lucio Victorio Mansilla (1877) thought he could discern two types of gaucho in the soldiers under his command: 
The &quot;paisano gaucho&quot; (country worker) has a home, a fixed abode, work habits, respect for authority, on whose side he will always be, even against his better feelings.

But the &quot;gaucho neto&quot; (out-and-out gaucho) is the typical wandering &quot;criollo&quot;, here today, there tomorrow; gambler, quarreler, enemy of discipline; who flees military service when it is his turn, takes refuge among the Indians if he knifes someone, or joins the &quot;montonera&quot; (armed rabble) if it shows up.

The first has the instincts of civilization; he imitates the man of the cities in his dress, in his customs. The second loves tradition; he hates foreigners; his luxury is his spurs, his flash gear, his leather sash, his facón (dagger-sword). The first takes off his poncho to go into town, the second goes there flaunting his trappings. The first is a cultivator, oxcart driver, cattle drover, herdsman, a peon. The second hires himself out for cattle branding. The first has been a soldier several times. The second was once part of a squadron and as soon as he saw his chance he deserted.

The first is always &quot;federal&quot;, the second is no longer anything. The first still believes in something; the second believes in nothing. He has suffered more than the city slicker, and so has been disillusioned quicker. He votes, because the Commander or the Mayor tells him to, and with that universal suffrage is achieved. If he has a claim, he drops it because he thinks it is frankly a waste of time. In a word, the first is a useful man for industry and work — the second is a dangerous inhabitant anywhere. If he resorts to the courts, it is because he has the instinct to believe that they will do him justice out of fear – and there are examples, if they don&#x27;t do it he takes revenge — he wounds or kills. The former makes up the Argentine social mass; the second is disappearing.

Already in 1845 a local dialect dictionary, by a knowledgeable compiler, gave &quot;gaucho&quot; as meaning any kind of rural worker, including one who cultivated the soil. To refer to the wandering sort, one had to specify further. Documentary research has shown the great majority of rural workers in Buenos Aires province were not herdsmen, but cultivators or shepherds. Thus, the gaucho that survives in today&#x27;s popular imagination — the galloping horseman — was not typical.

====Brazil and Uruguay====
Gauchos north of the Río de la Plata were similar to their Argentine counterparts; however there were some differences, particularly in the region straddling Brazil and Uruguay.

The Portuguese Crown, in order to conquer southern Brazil — it was disputed with the Spanish Empire — distributed vast tracts of land to a few hundred families. Labour in this region was scarce, so great landowners acquired it by allowing a social class, called &quot;agregados&quot;, to settle on their land with their own animals. Values were martial and paternalistic, for the territory went back and forth between Portugal and Spain.

Brazilian inheritance laws compelled landowners to leave their lands in equal shares to their sons and daughters, and since they were numerous, and those laws were hard to evade, great landholdings fractured in a few generations. There were not the huge cattle estates of Buenos Aires province where, as an extreme example, the Anchorena family owned in 1864.

Unlike Argentina, cattlemen in Rio Grande do Sul did not have vagrancy laws to tie gaúchos to their ranches. However, slavery was legal in Brazil; in Rio Grande do Sul it existed until 1884; and perhaps a majority of permanent ranch workers were enslaved. Thus many horse-riding &quot;campeiros&quot; (cowboys) were black slaves. They enjoyed sharply better living conditions than the slaves who worked in the brutal &quot;xarqueadas&quot; (beef-salting plants). John Charles Chasteen explained why:
Land-hungry Rio Grande cattlemen bought up estates cheaply in neighbouring Uruguay until they owned about 30% of that country, which they ranched with their slaves and cattle. The border area was fluid, bilingual and lawless. Though slavery was abolished in Uruguay in 1846, and there were laws against human trafficking, weak governments poorly enforced those laws. Often Brazilian ranchers simply ignored them, even crossing and re-crossing the border with their slaves and cattle. An 1851 extradition treaty required Uruguay to return fugitive Brazilian slaves.

Governments found it hard to establish a monopoly of violence in the border area. In the Federalist Revolution of 1893 gaúcho-manned armies led by elite families fought each other with exceptional barbarity. Powerful Brazilian-Uruguayan families, like the Saraivas, led mounted insurrections in both countries, even in the 20th century. In the satirical cartoon (1904) Aparicio Saravia says it is time for &quot;another little revolution&quot;: they have been at peace long enough and are starting to look ridiculous. This time, however, his mobile, lance-wielding horsemen were put down, and decisively, by Uruguayan troops armed with Mauser rifles and Krupp cannon, efficiently deployed by telegraph and rail.

===European immigration; fencing the pampa===
It was official government policy, enshrined in the Argentine Constitution of 1853, to encourage European immigration. The purpose, which was not concealed, was to supplant the &quot;lower races&quot; of the sparsely populated interior, including gauchos, whom the elite believed to be hopelessly backward. Famously, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Argentina&#x27;s second elected president, had written (in Facundo: Civilización y Barbarie) that gauchos, although audacious and skilled in country lore, were brutal, feckless, lived indolently in squalor, and — by upholding the caudillos (provincial strongmen) — were obstacles to national unity. The population was so thinly spread it was impossible to educate. They were barbarians, inimical to progress. Juan Bautista Alberdi, deviser of the Constitution, held that &quot;to govern is to populate&quot;. 

Once political stability was achieved the results were dramatic. From around 1875 a flood of immigrants altered the country&#x27;s ethnic composition. In 1914, 40% of Argentina&#x27;s residents were foreign-born. Today, Italian surnames are more common than Spanish.

Barbed wire, cheap from 1876, fenced the pampa &quot;and thus eliminated the need for gaucho cowboys&quot;. Gauchos were forced off the land, drifting into rural towns to look for work, though a few were retained as peon labourers. Cunninghame Graham, after whom a Buenos Aires street is named, and who had lived as a gaucho in the 1870s, returned in 1914 to &quot;his first love, Argentina&quot; and found it had greatly changed. &quot;Progress, which he constantly lambasted, had rendered the gaucho virtually extinct&quot;.

Wote S. Samuel Trifilo (1964): &quot;The gaucho of today working on the pampas of Argentina is no more a real gaucho than is our own present-day cowboy the cowboy of the Wild West; both have gone forever.&quot;

Two-thirds of Uruguay lies south of the Río Negro, and this part was fenced most intensively in the decade 1870-1880. The gaucho was marginalised and was frequently driven to live in &quot;pueblos de ratas&quot; (rural slums, literally rat towns).

North of the Río Negro mobile gauchos survived rather longer. A Scottish anthropologist in the central region (1882) saw many of them as unsettled. European immigration to the countryside was smaller. The central government failed to consolidate its power over the countryside, and gaucho-manned armies continued to defy it until 1904. The turbulent gaucho leaders e.g. the Saravias had connections with the cattlemen over the Brazilian border, where there was much less European immigration; Wire fences did not become common in the borderland until the close of the 19th century.

The revolutionary battles in Brazil ended by 1930 under the dictatorship of Getúlio Vargas, who disarmed the private gaúcho armies and prohibited the carrying of guns in public.

===The gaucho as an icon===
====Argentina====
In the 20th century urban intellectuals promoted the gaucho as the Argentine national icon; it was a reaction to massive European immigration and a rapidly changing way of life. Jeane DeLaney has argued that the immigrant was being scapegoated for the problems of modernity; thus, the sentiment was antimodernistic, with a xenophobic, nationalistic edge.

Writers variously reflecting this tendency included José María Ramos Mejía, Manuel Gálvez, Rafael Obligado, José Ingenieros, Miguel Cané, and above all Leopoldo Lugones and Ricardo Güiraldes. Their answer was to go back to values that could be attributed to the old-time gaucho. However, the gaucho they chose was not the one who cultivated the land, but the one who galloped across it.
For Lugones (1913), to discern a people&#x27;s true character, one had to read its epic poetry; and &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; was the Argentine epic poem &quot;par excellence&quot;. Far from being a barbarian, the gaucho was the hero who did what the Spanish Empire could not — civilise the pampa by subjugating the Indian. To be a gaucho demanded &quot;composure, courage, ingenuity, meditation, sobriety, vigour; all this made him a free man&quot;. But in that case, asked Lugones, why did the gaucho disappear? Because, together with his virtues, he had inherited two defects from his Indian and Spanish ancestors: laziness and pessimism. 

Lugones&#x27; lectures, where he canonised &quot;Martín Fierro&quot; with its quarreling gaucho protagonist, had official support: the president of the Republic and his cabinet attended them, as did prominent members of the traditional ruling classes.

However, wrote a Mexican scholar, in exalting this gaucho Lugones and others were not recreating a real historical character, they were weaving a nationalist myth, for political purposes. Jorge Luis Borges thought their choice of gaucho was a poor role model for Argentines.

Wrote musicologist Melanie Plesch:
The iconic gaucho gained traction in popular culture because he appealed to diverse social groups: displaced rural workers; European immigrants anxious to assimilate; traditional ruling classes wanting to affirm their own legitimacy. At a time when the elite was extolling Argentina as a &quot;white&quot; country, a fourth group, those who possessed dark skins, felt validated by the gaucho&#x27;s elevation, seeing that his non-white ancestry was too well known to be concealed.

Political factions have competed to appropriate the gaucho icon and interpret him their way. In a review of Ezequiel Adamovsky&#x27;s &quot;El gaucho indómito. De Martín Fierro a Perón, el emblema imposible de una nación desgarrada&quot; (The indomitable gaucho: from Martín Fierro to Perón, the impossible emblem of a torn nation), Raanan Rein wrote:

Today a popular movement celebrates gaucho culture.

====Brazil====

In Rio Grande do Sul the gaúcho has been mythified too, not in reaction to massive immigration as in Argentina, but to give the state a regional identity. The main celebration is the &quot;Semana Farroupilha&quot;, a week of festivities, mass horseback parades, &quot;churrasco&quot;, rodeos and dances. It refers to the Ragamuffin War (1835–45), an elite-led separatist war against the Brazilian Empire; politicians have reinterpreted it as democratic movement. Hence, wrote Luciano Bornholdt,

The &quot;Movimento Tradicionalista Gaúcho&quot; (MTG) has an active participation of two million people, and claims to be the largest popular culture movement in the Western world. Essentially urban, rooted in nostalgia for rural life, the MTG fosters gaúcho culture. There are 2,000 Centres for Gaúcho Traditions, not only in the state, but elsewhere, even Los Angeles and Osaka, Japan. Gaúcho products include television and radio programs, articles, books, dance halls, performers, records, theme restaurants, and clothing. The movement was founded by intellectuals, apparently sons of downwardly mobile small landowners who had moved to the cities to study. Since gaúcho culture was seen as male, only later were women invited to participate. Though the real gaúchos of history lived in the Campanha (plains region), some of the first to join were of German or Italian ethnicity from outside that area, a social class who had idealised the gaúcho rancher as a type superior to themselves.

==Horsemanship==
For many, an essential attribute of a gaucho is that he is a skilled horseman. Scottish physician and botanist David Christison noted in 1882, &quot;He has taken his first lessons in riding before he is well able to walk&quot;. Without a horse the gaucho himself felt unmanned. During the wars of the 19th century in the Southern Cone, the cavalries on all sides were composed almost entirely of gauchos. In Argentina, gaucho armies such as that of Martín Miguel de Güemes, slowed Spanish advances. Furthermore, many relied on gaucho armies to control the Argentine provinces.

The naturalist William Henry Hudson, who was born on the Pampas of Buenos Aires province, recorded that the gauchos of his childhood used to say that a man without a horse was a man without legs. He described meeting a blind gaucho who was obliged to beg for his food yet behaved with dignity and went about on horseback. Richard W. Slatta, the author of a scholarly work about gauchos, notes that the gaucho used horses to collect, mark, drive or tame cattle, to draw fishing nets, to hunt ostriches, to snare partridges, to draw well water, and even—with the help of his friends—to ride to his own burial.

By reputation the quintessential gaucho Juan Manuel de Rosas could throw his hat on the ground and scoop it up while galloping his horse, without touching the saddle with his hand. For the gaucho, the horse was absolutely essential to his survival for, said Hudson: &quot;he must every day traverse vast distances, see quickly, judge rapidly, be ready at all times to encounter hunger and fatigue, violent changes of temperature, great and sudden perils&quot;.

A popular was:
It was the gaucho&#x27;s passion to own all his steeds in matching colours. Hudson recalled: The gaucho, from the poorest worker on horseback to the largest owner of lands and cattle, has, or had in those days, a fancy for having all his riding-horses of one colour. Every man as a rule had his tropilla — his own half a dozen or a dozen or more saddle-horses, and he would have them all as nearly alike as possible, so that one man had chestnuts, another browns, bays, silver- or iron-greys, duns, fawns, cream-noses, or blacks, or whites, or piebalds.

The Chacho Peñaloza described the low point of his life as &quot;In Chile − and on foot!&quot; ()

===Extreme equestrianship===

Richard W. Slatta collected instances of extreme equestrian sports practiced by 19th century gauchos. To perform these required and developed skills and courage that helped gauchos to survive on the pampas.

*Crowding. Two men would spur their horses to shove against each other, each man&#x27;s object being to drive his opponent to a particular place. In a variant, they raced along a narrow track; if one man could crowd the other off it, he won.
*&quot;Cinchada&quot;. An equestrian tug-of-war, tail to tail; the rope was tied to their saddles. &quot;This contest grew out of the need for mounts strong enough to pull against a wild, lassoed steer&quot;.
*&quot;Pechando&quot;. Two horsemen galloping at full speed charged each other head on. The shock of the collision tumbled the men and perhaps the horses. The object was to recover and charge again and again until prevented by exhaustion or injury. &quot;Pechando provided an opportunity for a gaucho to exhibit his courage and indifference to death or injury.&quot;
*Jumping the bar. A bar was placed above a corral gate with just enough headroom for a horse to pass. A gaucho galloped through, and as he did, he jumped over the bar and landed back in the saddle.
*&quot;Maroma&quot;. A variant in which the gaucho jumped from the bar onto the back of a racing wild horse or wild steer. He had to stay on until the horse was broken or the steer was killed.
*Recado. The horseman galloped across the pampa while he undid his &quot;recado&quot; (a multi-layered saddle), dropping the pieces as he went. He had to go back, snatch up the pieces and reassemble his saddle, all the time riding at full speed.
*&quot;Pialar&quot;, a particularly dangerous sport. One man galloped through a group of gauchos who lassoed his horse&#x27;s legs. This threw the horse, but the man had to land on his feet holding the reins. This skill was useful for survival because the pampa was riddled with vizcacha burrows that threw horses; loss of one&#x27;s mount was probable death for a solitary rider.

Gauchos routinely maltreated their horses since these were plentiful. Even a poor gaucho usually had a &quot;tropilla&quot; of perhaps a dozen. Most of those sports were banned by the elite.

*&quot;La sortija&quot;. Carrying a lance, a galloping horseman had to impale a small ring dangling from a thread. Introduced from Spain, this sport is still practiced in Spanish-speaking countries.
*&quot;Pato&quot;. A game resembling rugby football on horseback, but ranging over miles of terrain. Banned in its original form, which was played with a live duck sewed into a rawhide basket, pato was gentrified and is now Argentina&#x27;s national sport.

The higher skills were lost as the gaucho was marginalized, wrote Slatta:

==Culture==

The gaucho plays an important symbolic role in the nationalist feelings of this region, especially that of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The epic poem by José Hernández (considered by some the national epic of Argentina) used the gaucho as a symbol against corruption and of Argentine national tradition, pitted against Europeanising tendencies. Martín Fierro, the hero of the poem, is drafted into the Argentine military for a border war, deserts, and becomes an outlaw and fugitive. The image of the free gaucho is often contrasted to the slaves who worked the northern Brazilian lands. Further literary descriptions are found in Ricardo Güiraldes&#x27; .

Gauchos were generally reputed to be strong, honest, silent types, but proud and capable of violence when provoked. The gaucho tendency to violence over petty matters is also recognized as a typical trait. Gauchos&#x27; use of the —a large knife generally tucked into the rear of the gaucho&#x27;s sash—is legendary, often associated with considerable bloodletting. Historically, the was typically the only eating instrument that a gaucho carried.

The gaucho diet was composed almost entirely of beef while on the range, supplemented by , an herbal infusion made from the leaves of yerba mate, a type of holly rich in caffeine and nutrients. The water for was heated short of boiling on a stove in a kettle, and traditionally served in a hollowed-out gourd and sipped through a metal straw called a .

Gauchos dressed and wielded tools quite distinct from North American cowboys. In addition to the lariat, gauchos used or ( in Portuguese)—three leather-bound rocks tied together with leather straps. The typical gaucho outfit would include a poncho, which doubled as a saddle blanket and as sleeping gear; a (dagger); a leather whip called a ; and loose-fitting trousers called or a poncho or blanket wrapped around the loins like a diaper called a , belted with a sash called a . A leather belt, sometimes decorated with coins and elaborate buckles, is often worn over the sash. During winters, gauchos wore heavy wool ponchos to protect against cold.

Their tasks were to move the cattle between grazing fields, or to market sites such as the port of Buenos Aires. The consists of branding the animal with the owner&#x27;s sign. The taming of animals was another of their usual activities. Taming was a trade especially appreciated throughout Argentina and competitions to domesticate wild foal remained in force at festivals. The majority of gauchos were illiterate and considered as countrymen.

Gauchos would frequent small businesses known as pulperías, which served as a general store, a tavern, and sometimes as a fence to which stolen goods were sold to. Pulperías were typically located far in the country side and sold items such as yerba mate, liquor, tobacco, sugar, clothing, horse tack, and may other things vital to survival in the countryside.

=== The Modern Gaucho ===
Though the fencing of the pampas ended the need for the gaucho in the traditional sense, much like cowboy culture in north America, gaucho culture is interwoven with the Latin American identity and is a way of life for many rural people to this day. The role of the gaucho has evolved from being a nomadic herder, to fulfilling the role of a ranch hand and cattleman with elite equestrian skills. Gauchos today work on large estancias tending to cattle, sheep, and horses as well as acting as guides for visiting tourists wishing to experience the gaucho way of life. Advances in technology have led to the incorporation of trucks, all-terrain vehicles, and modern equipment into contemporary operations, but horsemanship is still a crucial skill due to the rugged terrain of the area, as well as to pay homage to the culture.

With so much of gaucho life revolving around cattle, beef is still a major part of their culinary culture. The tradition of large cookouts known as asados is still prevalent in certain regions, with the event taking place in an outbuilding fitted with a large grill and outdoor kitchen known as a quincho. Typical foods include meats cooked over an open flame accompanied with chimichurri, and staples such as empanadas and mate.

Oral tradition is an important medium in which the heritage of the gaucho is maintained. Folk music is often used to tell stories, with themes of love, rural life, and the hardships that come with it being prevalent. Genres such as payada make strong use of this spoken word style medium, with performers known as payadors dressing in traditional clothing and exchanging improvised verses in a duel until a winner is clear.

The attire typically associated with gauchos has for the most part disappeared, however the traditional clothing is still sometimes worn to festivals and events, and as work wear in certain estancias that cater to tourism, known as paradores. The Facon is still often worn at asados, both in a symbolic manner and also to cut meat.

In recent years many environmental movements worldwide have drawn inspiration from the gaucho ideology of living in harmony with nature and being sustainable with farming practices. Public support for grass fed beef, maintaining biodiversity, and eco-tourism aligns closely with the way of life of modern gauchos. The gaucho lifestyle has been romanticized heavily in culture, and as a result many people pay to experience this lifestyle at estancias, much like dude ranches in the American west. At these ranches, guests partake in traditional activities such as horseback riding, roping, with other outdoor activities such as hunting (waterfowl, red deer), and trout fishing being common as well.

==Analogies==
The gaucho in some respects resembled members of other nineteenth century rural, horse-based cultures such as the North American cowboy ( in Spanish), of Central Chile, the Peruvian or , the Venezuelan and Colombian , the Ecuadorian , the Hawaiian , the Mexican , and the Portuguese , or even .

<doc id="386906" wikidata="Q3504658" url="?curid=386906" title="Mohawk Valley">
<text>The Mohawk Valley region of the U.S. state of New York is the area surrounding the [[Mohawk River]], sandwiched between the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains, northwest of the Capital District. As of the 2010 United States Census, the region&#x27;s counties have a combined population of 622,133 people. In addition to the Mohawk River valley, the region contains portions of other major watersheds such as the Susquehanna River.

The region is a suburban and rural area surrounding the industrialized cities of Schenectady, Utica and Rome, along with other smaller commercial centers. The area is an important agricultural center and encompasses the heavily forested wilderness areas just to the north that are part of New York&#x27;s Adirondack Park.

The Mohawk Valley is part of a natural passageway connecting the Atlantic Ocean, by way of the Hudson Valley, with the interior of North America. Native American Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy lived in the region. In the 17th century, Dutch, French and English immigrants —and in the 18th century German, Irish and Scottish—settled the area. Following the rapid industrialization of the mid-19th century, Italians and Welsh People settled in the valley.

During the 18th Century, the Mohawk Valley was a frontier of great political, military, and economic importance. Colonists— such as Phillip Schuyler, Nicholas Herkimer, William Johnson—trading with the Iroquois set the stage for commercial and military competition between European nations, leading to the French and Indian Wars and the American Revolution. Almost 100 battles of the American Revolution were fought in New York State, including the Battle of Oriskany, Battle of Saratoga and defense of Fort Stanwix. During the war, a series of raids against valley residents took place led by John Johnson. These raids were collectively known as the &quot;Burning of the Valleys&quot;.

In 1825, the Erie Canal was completed as the first commercial connection between the American East and West.

==Strategic importance==

During the French and Indian War, the Mohawk River Valley was of prime strategic importance; to the British, it provided a corridor to the Great Lakes from which to threaten New France directly, while to the French it provided a corridor to the Hudson Valley and on to the heart of British North America. In addition, many settlements of the Mohawk, Britain&#x27;s crucial Indian ally at the time of the war, were located in or near the valley.

At the beginning of the war, the major British stronghold in the Mohawk corridor was Fort Oswego, located on Lake Ontario. The French captured and destroyed the fort after a short siege in 1756, and the Mohawk Valley lay open to French advance as a result. Although the French did not directly exploit this avenue of attack, its impact swayed some of the Iroquois tribes to the French side.

==Mohawks of Mohawk Valley==

The original inhabitants of the Mohawk Valley can be traced back 10,000 plus years and included Algonquian people that later relocated from the newly established Fort Orange Dutch trading post region as early as 1624, as the name implies, the inhabitants were and remained Mohawks. The name Mohawk Valley has its origins in the years 1614 and 1624-25 following the settlement by Dutch traders who established a trading post in the Valley, the Mohawk tribe became alliances and targets during the Indian Wars.
The Mohawks of Mohawk Valley call themselves &quot;Kanien&#x27;keha&#x27;ka&quot;, and &quot;People of the Flint&quot; in part due to their creation story of a powerful flinted arrow. Among other things, the traditional use of Mohawk Valley flint as Toolmaking Flint is only one attribution to the Mohawk Valley People of the Flint name.

Schoharie County is sometimes considered to be part of the Mohawk Valley because the Schoharie Creek, primarily located in Schoharie County, is a major tributary that empties into the Mohawk River at Fort Hunter in Montgomery County. Furthermore, the northern border of Schoharie County with Montgomery County is very close to the Mohawk River.

Schenectady, Albany, and Saratoga counties are also sometimes considered to be part of the Mohawk Valley because the Mohawk River Flows through those 3 counties, the Mohawk River also ends at the Hudson River where Albany, Saratoga, and Rensselaer counties meet as a delta.

Schoharie, Montgomery, Fulton, Saratoga, Schenectady, and Albany counties are the only 6 counties within the Mohawk Valley to be part of the Capital District, Albany County is also considered part of the Hudson Valley.

==Popular culture==

* &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; (1936), an historical novel written by Walter D. Edmonds, is set in the Mohawk Valley near Deerfield during the American Revolutionary War. It was very carefully researched and portrayed the complexity of the times. The 1939 film of the same name, directed by John Ford, has been criticized for “[abandoning] the historical complexity of the original for the mythic simplification of an all-American Western.” 
* The Mohawk Valley is an important site in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot; published by Ubisoft. The game takes place during the Revolutionary War era and features an assassin tasked with playing a role in the history of early America.

<text>Hrubieszów (; ; , or ) is a town in southeastern Poland, with a population of around 18,212 (2016). It is the capital of Hrubieszów County within the Lublin Voivodeship.

Throughout history, the town&#x27;s culture and architecture was strongly shaped by its Polish Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic and Jewish inhabitants. Almost all of the Jewish community of the town, however, were murdered in the Holocaust. Hrubieszów is also the birthplace of the Polish writer, novelist and author of popular books Bolesław Prus, and the entrepreneur and Holocaust survivor Henry Orenstein.

== History ==
The area formed part of the Cherven Cities, a territory which was included within the emerging Polish state in the 10th century by its first historic ruler Mieszko I. It was invaded and annexed from Poland by Kievan Rus&#x27; in 981, and afterwards it changed possession several times between Poland and Rus&#x27;, and even fell to the Mongol Empire in the mid-13th century. The origins of the town go back to the early Middle Ages, when a defensive gord existed on the Huczwa river island. It was first mentioned in 1254, as a hunting settlement located among forests.

In 1366, the area, along with Hrubieszów, then called Rubieszów, was eventually recaptured by King Casimir III the Great, and reintegrated with the Kingdom of Poland. Sometime in the late 14th century, a wooden castle was built here, as a residence of a local governor. Probably in 1400 Rubieszów received a town charter from Polish king Władysław II Jagiełło, who visited it in 1411, 1413 and 1430. A castle and church were later added. King Casimir IV Jagiellon ordered the construction of a route from Lublin to Lwów passing through Rubieszów. The town was destroyed several times by Crimean Tatars, who raided this area in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries, and by the rebellious Cossacks.

After the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Hrubieszów was annexed by Austria. In 1800, Stanisław Staszic founded the Hrubieszów Agricultural Society, the first cooperative organization in Europe, which existed until 1945. The name of the town was changed in 1802 from Rubieszów to Hrubieszów. Following the Austro-Polish War of 1809 the town became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, then in 1815 it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, within the Lublin Governorate. In 1909, its population was 15,000. In the final weeks of World War I, in November 1918, a newly formed Polish unit from Chełm liberated the town. It was integrated with reborn Poland, within which it was administratively part of the Lublin Voivodeship. In 1919, the 4th Polish Rifles Regiment was based in Hrubieszów, before relocating to Bełz.
During the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the German army entered the town on 15 September 1939. Ten days later the Germans withdrew and the Soviet army occupied the town, but after a fortnight returned it to the Germans, in accordance with a new Soviet-German agreement. During the German occupation, the region witnessed the Zamość Uprising. Many inhabitants, including almost all of the 7,000 Jewish residents, were murdered in the Holocaust. In 1944, the German occupation ended, and the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

After World War II, what remained of the town&#x27;s Ukrainian population was expelled to the Soviet Union. In May 1946, the town was the site of the largest joint action by the partisans of the Polish anti-communist Freedom and Independence movement and those of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.

Between 1975 and 1998, the town was administratively part of the Zamość Voivodeship.

== Jewish community ==
The Jewish population numbered 709 in 1765, 3,276 in 1856, 5,352 (out of 10,636) in 1897, in 1921, there were 5679, and probably around 7500 in 1939.

During World War II, the German army immediately organized a series of &quot;aktions&quot; after it invaded the town on 15 September 1939. Over 2,000 Jews, having experienced the Nazi German terror, left with the withdrawing Soviet army, which shortly occupied the town after 25 September 1939. On 2 December 1939, 1,000 Jews from Hrubieszów and 1,100 from Chełm were led on a death march to the Bug River. Hundreds were murdered along the way, survivors were forced to try to swim across the Bug to the USSR, but the Soviets did not permit them to enter. The survivors returned to Hrubieszów. In August 1940, German police arrested about 800 Jews and deported 600 to a forced labor camp where about half died. Sometime between the summer of 1940 and June 1942, an occupation ghetto was formed. Both local Jews and those forced to move to Hrubieszów were confined to a fixed area. By April 1942, there were more than 5800 Jews in the ghetto.
In June 1942, around 3,000 Jews from the ghetto were rounded up, some were killed in the town, and most were sent to the Sobibor extermination camp where they were all killed. The second deportation from Hrubieszów took place on 28 October 1942, when 2,500 Jews were deported to Sobibor and killed. Around 400 who resisted were executed at the Jewish cemetery and the last 160 Jews were sent to a forced labor camp in Budzyń. About 140 of Hrubieszów&#x27;s Jews are thought to have survived. They were mostly those who had fled to Soviet controlled territory at the beginning of the war.

=== Jewish resistance ===
In the summer of 1941, Julek (Joel/Jakób) Brandt, a leader of the Zionist youth movement Betar from Chorzów who was a relative of the chairman of the Hrubieszów Judenrat (Jewish Council) Samuel Brandt, arranged for several hundred members of the Betar youth movement in the Warsaw Ghetto to work on local farms and estates, including one in Dłużniów and Werbkowice. Before the war, the estate in Dłużniów had belonged to Maks Glazermann, a Jewish engineer from Lwów who was left to run the property. Among those sent to Dłużniów was a young woman from Warsaw named Hanka Tauber. Her account of what went on there was recorded in the ghetto diary of Abraham Lewin.

Most of the Betar youth were killed in the spring of 1942 and in subsequent months together with the local Jewish population. A small number, however, managed to return to the ghetto and later took part in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Julek Brandt escaped from a transport heading for the Sobibor extermination camp. He was denounced by locals who tuned him over to the Gestapo in Hrubieszów. There he was put to work by &quot;Gestapo Obersturmbannführer&quot; Ebner, who named him chief of a small work camp on Jatkowa Street. At the end of 1942 or the beginning of 1943, Brandt was executed by Ebner.

== Transport ==
National road 74 runs through the town, continuing to the road border crossing with Ukraine at Zosin-Ustyluh located about 20 km to the east. In 2015 the road was rerouted to a newly built bypass avoiding the town centre. A wide gauge Hrubieszów–Sławków Południowy LHS railway runs through the town. A normal gauge railway runs parallel to it, which carries two pairs of PKP Intercity trains, first through southern Poland to Jelenia Góra and second through northern-central Poland to Piła. Lublin Airport is the closest international airport, located about 120 km away by road.

<doc id="386910" wikidata="Q319445" url="?curid=386910" title="Biłgoraj">
<text>Biłgoraj (, &quot;Bilgoray&quot;, ) is a town in south-eastern Poland with 25,838 inhabitants as of December 2021. Since 1999 it has been situated in Lublin Voivodeship; it was previously located in Zamość Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is located south of Lublin and it is also the capital of Biłgoraj County. Historically, the town belongs to Lesser Poland, and is located in southeastern corner of the province, near the border with another historic land, Red Ruthenia. Biłgoraj is surrounded by a forest, with three rivers flowing through it.

==Etymology==
The name of the town probably comes from a hill called Biely Goraj, on which Biłgoraj was founded in the 16th century.

==Geography==

Biłgoraj lies in northern part of Sandomierz Basin, near Roztocze. The town is surrounded by Solska Forest, from Roztocze National Park. An average July temperature in Biłgoraj is , an average January temperature . The town is crossed by four small rivers: Biała Łada, Czarna Łada, Osa and Próchnica. Biłgoraj lies on the elevations ranging from 184 to 212 meters above sea level. The area of the town is , of which forests covers 9%. Built-up area stretches along eastern bank of the Biała Łada, for (north–south) and (west–east).

==History==
===From the 16th century until 1918===
The area of current Biłgoraj was covered by dense forests and swamps, where establishment of human settlements was difficult. In the first half of the 16th century, local noble family of Gorajski built first settlements in this sparsely populated corner of Lesser Poland. At that time, the villages of Gromada, Dąbrowica and Olendrów were founded.

The town of Biłgoraj was officially established in 1570 by Adam Gorajski, and incorporated by King Stefan Batory at Lviv on 10 September 1578. Its main market square was placed on the hill called Bialy Goraj. The town, surrounded by rivers, held a strategic position and was easy to defend. Biłgoraj quickly grew, due to a busy merchant road from Jarosław to Lublin. Biłgoraj town was surrounded by a defensive wall with watchtowers, although the town&#x27;s further growth extended into suburbs. A bridge was built over the Biala Lada. Until 1693 Biłgoraj remained in the hands of the Gorajski family. Throughout the 18th century, it belonged either to the Szczuka family or the Potocki family. Most houses in Biłgoraj were made of wood, which resulted in several fires. Furthermore, the wars of the mid-17th century destroyed the town twice; first in 1648, when the town was burned by the Cossacks of Bohdan Khmelnytsky; then in 1655, by the Swedes during the deluge.

Biłgoraj was an important center of the Bar Confederation, and in the area of the town several skirmishes took place between the Poles and the Russians. After the Partition of Poland, Biłgoraj was annexed by the Austrian Empire, and in 1809 it became part of Duchy of Warsaw (since 1815, Russian-controlled Congress Kingdom). In the late 18th century its population was 3,000; and grew to 6,000 by 1865. At that time, it was the third biggest town of Lublin Governorate, after Lublin and Hrubieszów.

In 1806 following the Partitions, Biłgoraj – which was still privately owned and on the verge of bankruptcy – was purchased by the local entrepreneur named Stanisław Nowakowski,&lt;ref name=&quot;bilgoraj.lbl.pl/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who built for himself a palace in Biłgoraj&#x27;s district of Roznowka, modelled after Warsaw&#x27;s famous Łazienki Palace. The town remained in the hands of the Nowakowski family until 1850, when it was sold to the Tsarist official Nikolay Platonov (Mikołaj Płatonow), and in 1864 appropriated by the government as the seat of a county. During the January Uprising, several skirmishes took place Biłgoraj and its vicinity.

===1918 to 1939===
In 1918 Biłgoraj returned to newly created Second Polish Republic. Its population in 1921 reached 5,600. In 1928, electrification reached the town, but Biłgoraj nevertheless remained poor and underdeveloped, where most houses were constructed of wood. Historically, the town was a center of a large Jewish community, whose population in 1931 reached 4,596.

=== WWII and The Holocaust ===
On 11 September 1939 a unit of German-minority Fifth column agents set fire to the town, which destroyed most of it. A few days later Nazi German troops entered the town and immediately organized anti-Jewish pogroms. Furthermore, the Luftwaffe bombed Biłgoraj twice (8 and 14 September). On 15–16 September 1939, units of Kraków Army and Lublin Army retreating towards Tomaszow Lubelski, fought the Wehrmacht in the Battle of Biłgoraj. The Germans tried to capture the towns several times, but they did not manage to do so until 17 September, after yet another fire. On 28 September, units of the Red Army entered Biłgoraj, but they retreated after a few weeks, and the town became part of the Nazi-ruled General Government. On 25 June 1940 a ghetto was established.

During the German occupation, Biłgoraj was an important center of the resistance. Local units of the Home Army and other clandestine organizations took part in the Zamość Uprising. Germans knew well that Solska Forest was filled with Polish fighters, and the Poles frequently attacked German units in Biłgoraj. The most famous incident of this kind took place on 24 September 1943, when a Home Army unit under Tadeusz Sztumberk-Rychter attacked Biłgoraj&#x27;s prison, releasing 72 inmates, including Ludwik Ehrlich.

There was also Jewish partisan resistance in the Bilgoraj area. On 17 and 26 August 1943, two other clashes are recorded: one in the village of Podgranicznik, northwest of Krasnystaw, in which two Jews were killed; and another in the village of Poreba, east of Bilgoraj, between a large partisan unit and the Nazi German Truppenzpolizei.

Six transports to Belzec gas chambers took place from Bilgoraj: 500 Jews in April 1942; 1,000 Jews in May 1942; 1,200 Jews in August 1942; 5,000 Jews in September 1942; 500 Jews in October 1942; and 2,000 Jews in November 1942. On 15 January 1943 the last 27 survivors who had remained in hiding were shot. Very few of the Jewish partisans from Bilgoraj survived the war due to great efforts by the Nazi Germans to hunt them down in the woods.

Most of Biłgoraj&#x27;s Jews were murdered in the Holocaust. Only around 50 Jews survived the war. The Germans left Biłgoraj on 24 July 1944. During the war, 80% of the town was destroyed, and it lost 50% of its population.

The park was designed as a garden in the 17th century. The original gate to the town still stands there. The old garden keeper&#x27;s cottage also survives to this day. The same cannot be said about the small villa which stood deep in the park, but now has been completely vandalised.
* Polish Baroque Church of the Assumption of Mary from the early 17th century. The building is located on Trzeciego Maja Street, next to Plac Wolności (Market Square).
* Church of the St. George on Tadeusz Kościuszko Street, not very large building from the 19th century, former Eastern Orthodox church.

==Transport==
Biłgoraj is located away from main Polish roads. It is a junction of two voivodeship roads - road nr. 835 (north–south, from Lublin to Przemyśl), and road nr. 858 (east–west, from Zamość to Nisko). Nearest national road nr. 74 (Zamość - Stalowa Wola) goes north of the town. Biłgoraj has a rail station on a secondary-importance line from Zamość to Stalowa Wola, through the town also goes the Broad Gauge Metallurgy Line. Nearest airport, Rzeszów-Jasionka Airport, is located to the south.

==Industry==

In Biłgoraj are located a headquarter and main factories of Black Red White, leading furniture manufacturer in Poland. The town is also known as a center of wine industry (&quot;Ambra&quot; company bottling plants are located in village Wola Duża, east of the city), knitting (mainly thanks to &quot;Mewa&quot; factory) and production of cardboard packaging, wooden doors and windows.

==Local folklore==
Biłgoraj is an important center of local folklore, with highly developed folk art, regional clothes and customs. This is due to the town&#x27;s location, among forests, where communication with other communities was limited. There are several “Biłgoraj-style” houses, and in the area numerous wayside shrines can be found. Biłgoraj&#x27;s folklore was used by Grzegorz Ciechowski in his songs written as Grzegorz z Ciechowa. Until the 19th century, famous green Biłgoraj beer was produced in the town. Furthermore, for centuries Biłgoraj was a major national center of sieve makers. The town has a Regional Museum and an Open-air museum Zagroda Sitarska. Due to its proximity to Roztocze National Park, it is visited by a number of tourists. It also has a Baroque church of Holy Trinity (17th century) and 12 different monuments.

<text>Tomaszów Lubelski is a town in south-eastern Poland with 19,365 inhabitants (2017). Situated in the Lublin Voivodeship, near Roztocze National Park, it is the capital of Tomaszów Lubelski County.

==History==

The town was founded at the end of the 16th century by Jan Zamoyski as Jelitowo. It is known by its current name since 1613 when it was renamed after Zamoyski&#x27;s son, Tomasz. It obtained its city charter in 1621. It was administratively located in the Bełz Voivodeship in the Lesser Poland Province of Poland. The area around the city saw serious fighting in 1914 during World War I.

On 17–26 September 1939, during the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland which started World War II, the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski was fought between Poland and Germany. The town was bombed by the Germans and eventually found itself under German occupation. The town&#x27;s Jewish community, which numbered over 5,600 in 1939 at the start of the war, was persecuted by the occupiers in the Holocaust. The Nazi Germans first placed the Jews in a ghetto established in the town, then exterminated them in 1942 at Bełżec extermination camp located a few km. south of the town. The Jewish community ceased to exist.

In 1975–1998, the town was administratively located in the Zamość Voivodeship.

<text>Parry Sound is a town in Ontario, Canada, located on the eastern shore of the sound after which it is named. Parry Sound is located south of Sudbury and north of Toronto. It is a single-tier government located in the territorial District of Parry Sound, which has no second-tier county, regional, or district level of government. Parry Sound is a popular cottage country region for Southern Ontario residents. It also has the world&#x27;s deepest natural freshwater port.

==History==
There was a slight decline in economic activity shortly after World War I with J.R. Booth&#x27;s construction of a rival town, Depot Harbour, on nearby Parry Island, but this setback was overcome through later developments in tourism and commerce, and the accidental destruction by fire of the entire town of Depot Harbour on August 14, 1945.

The body of water that gives the town its name was surveyed and named by Captain (later Admiral) Henry Wolsey Bayfield in the 19th century in honour of the Arctic explorer Sir William Edward Parry. In 1857, the modern townsite was established near the Ojibwa village of Wasauksing (&quot;shining shore&quot;) at the mouth of the Seguin River. The post office was established in 1865. Parry Sound was incorporated as a town in 1887. In the late 19th century, rail service was established, making the town an important depot along the rail lines to Western Canada.

In 1916, a cordite factory was established in the nearby town of Nobel for the Imperial Munitions Board. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, an explosives and munitions factory was also built at Nobel, making Parry Sound an important part of both the First World War and the Second World War effort.

===Forest fire protection history===

The Parry Sound Forest Fire District was founded by Ontario&#x27;s former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario&#x27;s forests from fire by early detection from fire towers. The headquarters for the district were housed in town. It was the central location for 18 fire tower lookouts, including the Parry Sound fire tower, which was erected in the same location as the modern lookout tower at 17 George Street. In the 1970s all the towers had been decommissioned as aerial firefighting techniques were employed. Fire suppression is of enhanced concern in and near Parry Sound due to this area&#x27;s strong tendency toward drier weather coinciding with the period of highest sun, in June and July. In years with drier summers, drought can be a significant concern here, and with it, heightened wildfire risk.

==Climate==
Parry Sound has a humid continental climate, with local variations in cloudiness and precipitation resulting from its location on the eastern shore of the large body of water, comprising Parry Sound and Lake Huron to its west. Parry Sound&#x27;s annual temperature regime reflects a cool summer humid continental climate (Koppen Dfb), with January average temperatures of and July average temperatures near , and the usual minimal seasonal lag typical of continental climates: i.e. January as the coldest month and July as the warmest.

Much more unusual (for Dfb climates) is Parry Sound&#x27;s average annual cycle of precipitation, and cloudiness vs. sunshine. With its location on the eastern side of large bodies of water, where prevailing winds and weather come from the west (typical in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere), Parry Sound experiences an exceptionally strong lake effect. From spring to mid-summer, this means lake waters are cooler than nearby land areas, resulting in diminished intensity of low pressure systems and less precipitation, but alternation of low clouds and fog (resulting from warmer air passing over snow-covered ground, frequent into May most years) with occasional sunshine, especially once the long winter&#x27;s snow cover has melted (mostly May through July). Parry Sound&#x27;s average driest month is July; here, thunderstorms are rare, due to cool lake waters inhibiting the combination of heat and humidity that fuels thunderstorm activity over areas like the central, southern and eastern United States.
From September to January in Parry Sound the lake effect reverses its stabilizing effect from spring into mid-summer, becoming destabilizing. During these months, nearby waters release their stored warmth from the summer season, and increasingly strong polar and Arctic air outbreaks pass over these still-relatively-warm waters before hitting Parry Sound. This results in heavy cumulus cloud formation, instability rain showers (in September and October), transitioning toward heavy snow showers and squalls as temperatures continue to drop from November to January. Parry Sound&#x27;s average monthly precipitation exceeds inches every month from September to January - but this pattern peaks in December, the year&#x27;s average wettest month, which averages over of precipitation, mostly carried by that month&#x27;s average of of snow, followed by January&#x27;s snowfall average of . Such heavy winter-month precipitation and snowfall figures are virtually nonexistent in humid continental climates, which tend to exist away from large bodies of water. As winter transitions toward spring, snowfall drops sharply by March, when lake and land temperatures nearly equalize. In winter, the heavy lake-effect snowfall is augmented by snowfall from sometimes-strong low-pressure systems (mid-latitude cyclones) that often converge on the Great Lakes and areas further east.

Overall, Parry Sound experiences a typical humid continental, cool-summer climate type in terms of temperatures - but a highly unusual climate regime in precipitation and cloudiness; the year&#x27;s driest months are generally from March through July, while its wettest months are from September to January, with autumnal lake effect producing cloudy skies and heavy rainfall from September into November, followed by extremely heavy snowfall in December and January.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Parry Sound was on July 6, 1921. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on February 12. 1967.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Parry Sound had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

According to the 2016 census, the median total income of economic families in 2015 was $69,911.

== Culture ==
Parry Sound is the birthplace of hockey legend Bobby Orr, the namesake of the local community centre and the town&#x27;s own Bobby Orr Hall of Fame. In Orr&#x27;s best-selling autobiography, &quot;&quot;, he speaks highly of Parry Sound, the friends and family who resided there and the happy childhood he had living in that part of Canada.

Canadian actor Don Harron&#x27;s stage character Charlie Farquharson remains one of the town&#x27;s most cherished personalities. Former Ontario premier Ernie Eves also called the town home for many years; he was the MPP for the Parry Sound—Muskoka riding from 1981 through 2001.

The town is home to several cultural festivals, including the Festival of the Sound classical music festival, an annual dragonboat race and a buskers&#x27; festival which takes place as part of the town&#x27;s Canada Day festivities. The Charles W. Stockey Centre for the Performing Arts serves as the principal performance venue during the Festival of the Sound, and also hosts concerts, live theatre and other cultural events throughout the year.

==Recreation and sports==
There are several provincial parks in the Parry Sound area, including Oastler Lake, The Massasauga and Killbear, as well as numerous provincial conservation reserves, including the Georgian Bay Biosphere Reserve, one of only 13 UNESCO sites in Canada. The eastern coast of Georgian Bay where Parry Sound is located is known as the &quot;30,000 Islands&quot; and is considered the world&#x27;s largest freshwater archipelago. It covers 347,000 hectares of shoreline ecosystem, and over 100 species of animals and plants that are at risk in Canada and Ontario, including unique reptiles and amphibians. Parry Sound&#x27;s Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary cares for injured and orphaned animals, and offers an informational and interpretive centre for wildlife education. A 230-kilometre recreational trail, the Park-to-Park Trail, connects Killbear with Algonquin Provincial Park in two locations, to the south at Dwight, and farther north, east of Kearney.

Parry Sound, and much of Central and Northern Ontario, are well known for their tourism businesses. Accommodation businesses range from hotels and full service resorts to lodges and camping grounds. Sightseeing tours of the 30,000 Islands are offered by Georgian Bay Airways, and the Island Queen and MV Chippawa cruise ships. kayak and canoe rentals and tours are available during the summer, as well as winter sporting gear rentals during the winter. The town is home to an annual ATV Jamboree, and guided ATV tours of the region&#x27;s wilderness are available throughout the year. There are several golf courses located in and near Parry Sound; ice hockey, fishing, cross-country skiing, and softball are also popular recreational sports in the area. Cross-country skiing in the Parry Sound area is based out of Georgian Nordic Outdoor Activity Centre (GNOAC). Famous NHLer Bobby Orr played minor hockey for the Parry Sound Shamrocks. Another more recent professional hockey player who played for the Shamrocks is Aidan Dudas who plays for HC TPS of the Finnish SM-Liiga. Aidan was selected in the fourth round (113th overall) of the 2019 NHL Draft by the Los Angeles Kings. The town had a junior team also called the Shamrocks for a short period of time who reached the Northern Ontario Junior Hockey Association championship finals in 1998 and 1999 before the team folded in 2003.

==Transportation==

Parry Sound is located along a highway which currently bears the dual designation of Highway 69/Highway 400. From the opening of this freeway alignment in 2004 until October 26, 2010, a point one kilometre north of Parry Sound&#x27;s Bowes Street/McDougall Road interchange was the terminus of Highway 400, but the freeway now begins 17 kilometres further north, at Highway 559 north of Nobel. The former alignment of Highway 69 from Parry Sound southerly to Holmur now has the street name Oastler Park Drive and serves as the main access road to Oastler Lake Provincial Park.

The western termini of Highway 124, which extends easterly to Sundridge, and Highway 518, which heads east to Kearney, are both located just outside Parry Sound&#x27;s town limits.

Bus service from Toronto is available by Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services, the government-owned transportation company, and buses arrive daily en route to Sudbury. In addition, Via Rail&#x27;s &quot;Canadian&quot; (Toronto – Vancouver) transcontinental passenger train serve Parry Sound railway stations twice a week both east- and westbound. Westbound passenger as well as Canadian Pacific Kansas City and Canadian National Railway freight trains are carried over the Seguin River by the Parry Sound CPR Trestle, a visible presence in the centre of town.

The town is served by the Parry Sound Area Municipal Airport and the Parry Sound Medical Heliport, as well as numerous small water aerodromes:
* Parry Sound Harbour Water Aerodrome (CPS1)
* Parry Sound/Deep Bay Water Aerodrome (CPT6)
* Parry Sound/Derbyshire Island Water Aerodrome (CDS6)
* Parry Sound/Frying Pan Island-Sans Souci Water Aerodrome (CPS9)
* Parry Sound/Huron Island Water Aerodrome (CPS8)
* Parry Sound/St. Waleran Island Water Aerodrome (CPD6)

The Big Sound Marina is a 120-serviced slip marina on Georgian Bay for transient vessels up to .

==Canadian Coast Guard Parry Sound Base==
Canadian Coast Guard has a base in Parry Sound at 28 Waubeek Street. The base has berthing and maintenance facilities for CCG vessels. CCGS Samuel Risley and CCGS Cove Isle are the current home ported vessels at the CCG base. There is an unregistered helipad at the base next to the Waubuno Beach boat launch and is the home base to two helicopters, a Bell 412 and a Bell 429.

The entrance to the station is a shack with lantern room from the historic Cape Robert Lighthouse formerly on Manitoulin Island

<text>Robert Monsey Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth, PC (18 December 1790 – 26 July 1868) was a British lawyer and Liberal politician. He twice served as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

==Background and education==
Born at Cranworth, Norfolk, he was the elder son of the Reverend Edmund Rolfe and Jemima Alexander, James Alexander, 1st Earl of Caledon&#x27;s niece and a granddaughter of physician Messenger Monsey. Rolfe, a relative of Admiral Lord Horatio Nelson, was educated at Bury St Edmunds, Winchester, Trinity College, Cambridge, Downing College, Cambridge (of which he was elected fellow) and was called to the bar, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, in 1816.

==Legal and political career==
Cranworth represented Penryn and Falmouth in Parliament from 1832 until he was appointed a Baron of the Exchequer in 1839. In 1850 he was appointed a Vice-Chancellor and raised to the peerage as Baron Cranworth, of Cranworth in the County of Norfolk. In 1852 Lord Cranworth became Lord Chancellor in Lord Aberdeen&#x27;s coalition ministry.

In 1854, Cranworth was appointed to the Royal Commission for Consolidating the Statute Law, a royal commission to consolidate existing statutes and enactments of English law.

Cranworth continued to hold the chancellorship also in the administration of Lord Palmerston until the latter&#x27;s resignation in 1858. Cranworth was not reappointed when Palmerston returned to office in 1859, but on the retirement of Lord Westbury in 1865 he accepted the office for a second time, and held it till the fall of the Russell administration in 1866.

==Personal life==
In 1845, Cranworth married Laura Carr (1807–1868), daughter of Thomas William Carr (born 1770). The couple had no children.

Lord Cranworth died at his seat, Holwood House, on 26 July 1868, aged 77, after a short illness related to the heat. He was childless and the title became extinct on his death.

<doc id="386916" wikidata="Q1048711" url="?curid=386916" title="Inuksuk">
<text>An inuksuk (plural inuksuit) or inukshuk (from the , plural ; alternatively &#x27; in Inuinnaqtun, &#x27; in Iñupiaq,  in Greenlandic) is a type of stone landmark or cairn built by, and for the use of, Inuit, Iñupiat, Kalaallit, Yupik, and other peoples of the Arctic region of North America. These structures are found in northern Canada, Greenland, and Alaska (United States). This combined region, north of the Arctic Circle, is dominated by the tundra biome and has areas with few natural landmarks.

The inuksuk may historically have been used for navigation, as a point of reference, a marker for travel routes, fishing places, camps, hunting grounds, places of veneration, drift fences used in hunting, or to mark a food cache. The Iñupiat in northern Alaska used inuksuit to assist in the herding of caribou into contained areas for slaughter. Varying in shape and size, the inuksuit have ancient roots in Inuit culture.

Historically, the most common types of inuksuit are built with stone placed upon stone. The simplest type is a single stone positioned in an upright manner. The size of some inuksuit suggests that the construction was often a communal effort.

At Inuksuk Point (Enukso Point) on Baffin Island, there are more than 100 inuksuit. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1969.

==Name==
The word means &quot;that which acts in the capacity of a human&quot;. The word comes from the morphemes () and (). It is pronounced in Nunavik and the southern part of Baffin Island (see Inuit phonology for the linguistic reasons). In many of the central Nunavut dialects, it has the etymologically related name (plural: ).

While the predominant English spelling is , both the Government of Nunavut and the Government of Canada through Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada promote the Inuit-preferred spelling .

A structure similar to an inuksuk is called an (, , plural ); it is meant to represent a human figure. has become widely familiar to non-Inuit, and is particularly found in Greenland. However, it is not the most common type of inuksuk. It is distinguished from inuksuit in general.

The Hammer of Thor, located on the Ungava Peninsula, Quebec is most likely an inuksuk rather than of viking origin. 

==Modern usage==
Inuksuit continue to serve as an Inuit cultural symbol. An inuksuk is the centrepiece of the flag and coat of arms of the Canadian territory of Nunavut, and the flag of Nunatsiavut. The Inuksuk High School in Iqaluit is named after the landmark.

Inuksuitparticularly, but not exclusively, of the varietyare also increasingly serving as a mainstream Canadian national symbol. In 1999, Inukshuk was the name for the International Arctic Art &amp; Music Project of ARBOS in the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Nunavik, and Nunavut; and in Greenland, Austria, Denmark and Norway.

On July 13, 2005, Canadian military personnel erected an inuksuk on Hans Island, along with a plaque and a Canadian flag, as part of Canada&#x27;s longstanding dispute with Denmark over the small Arctic island. The markers have been erected throughout the country, often as generic gateways into tourist regions, including a inuksuk that stands in Toronto on the shores of Lake Ontario. Located in Battery Park, it commemorates the World Youth Day 2002 festival that was held in the city in July 2002.

An is the basis of the logo of the 2010 Winter Olympics designed by Vancouver artist Elena Rivera MacGregor. Its use in this context has been controversial among the Inuit, and the First Nations within British Columbia. Although the design has been questioned, people believe it pays tribute to Alvin Kanak&#x27;s 1986 inuksuk at English Bay. Friendship and the welcoming of the world are the meanings of both the English Bay structure and the 2010 Winter Olympics emblem.
The Vancouver 2010 logo and the construction of inuksuit around the world have led to increasing recognition of them. There are five authentic inuksuit which were donated to other jurisdictions wholly or in partby the government of Canada: they are located in Brisbane, Australia; Monterrey, Mexico; Oslo, Norway; Washington, D.C., United States; and Guatemala City, Guatemala.
A Canadian-donated inuksuk was built in Monterrey, Mexico, in October 2007 by the Inuvialuk artist Bill Nasogaluak. The sculpture was presented to the people of the northern state of Nuevo León as a gift from the Monterrey chapter of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Mexico and the Government of Canada, to mark the chamber&#x27;s 10th anniversary in the city. The sculpture stands over the Santa Lucía Riverwalk. Nasogaluak, of Tuktoyaktuk, personally chose the rocks for the structure from a local quarry near Monterrey. The inuksuk contains two rocks which the artist took to Mexico from Canada, one from the high Arctic and another from his home town of Toronto. Together they form the inuksuk&#x27;s heart.

The inuksuk was also used as the symbol of the Summit of the Americas, because of its connotations of &quot;guidance and unity ... towards common goals.&quot;

Officials in various wilderness parks throughout Canada routinely dismantle inuksuit constructed by hikers and campers, for fear that they could misdirect park visitors from the cairns and other markers that indicate hiking trails. The practice of erecting inuksuit in parks has become so widespread that Killarney Provincial Park, on the north shore of Ontario&#x27;s Georgian Bay, issued a notice in 2007 urging visitors to &quot;stop the invasion&quot; of inuksuit.

A large number of inuksuit have been built in some areas along the Trans-Canada Highway, including Northern Ontario. In 2010, a journalist from Sudbury&#x27;s &quot;Northern Life&quot; counted 93 inuksuit along Highway 69 between Sudbury and Parry Sound. The journalist successfully tracked down a person who had built two inuksuit along the route; he attributed his action to having had a &quot;fill the dreams moment where I needed to stop and do it&quot; while driving home from a family funeral.

In 2015, a small group of women near Hamilton, Ontario, constructed 1,181 inuksuit on the Chedoke Rail Trail to memorialize the issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, while seeking government action. It was one of many types of activism across the county, and the newly elected government committed to conducting a national inquiry that year.

According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, the tallest inuksuk is in Schomberg, Ontario, Canada. Built in 2007, it is tall.

On the occasion of the 20th Anniversary of the Rome Statute, to mark Canada&#x27;s support for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and as a symbol for its commitment to reconciliation with Canada&#x27;s First Nations, Canadian Minister of Justice and Attorney General Wilson-Raybould on 7 March 2018 donated an inuksuk as a gift to the ICC. It was unveiled by her and ICC President Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi at the ICC premises in The Hague.

<doc id="386917" wikidata="Q138229" url="?curid=386917" title="Oleśnica">
<text>Oleśnica (; ) is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland, within the Wrocław metropolitan area. It is the administrative seat of Oleśnica County and also of the rural district of Gmina Oleśnica, although it is not part of the territory of the latter, the town being an urban gmina in its own right.

The town is famed for its large 16th-century castle, which has previously been the seat of several dukes and lords. The castle&#x27;s inner courtyard arcades, a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture, are iconic in the region.

==Name==
The town&#x27;s name comes from Polish &quot;olsza&quot; (&quot;Alder&quot;); &quot;Olcha&quot; is an Old Slavic word for this common plant and tree. On 22 February 1255 the Silesian duke Henry III the White, son of the Polish High Duke Henry II the Pious, vested &quot;civitas nostra Olsnicz&quot; (&quot;our town Oleśnica&quot;) with town privileges.

==Geography==
The town is situated in the Silesian Lowlands east of the Trzebnickie Hills, part of the historical region of Lower Silesia. It is situated on the Oleśnica River, a tributary of Widawa. Located about northeast of the Silesian capital Wrocław, it has been a stop on an important trade route to the Greater Poland region, Kalisz, Łódź and Warsaw; it had close ties with Kraków via Namysłów in the east. It was the site of an important printing press and &quot;gymnasium&quot;.

The town quarters are Centrum, Serbinów, Lucień, Lucień Osiedle, Wądoły, Rataje (Stare, Nowe) and Zielone Ogrody.

== History ==
The Piast castle with a nearby abbey and trading settlement was first mentioned in an 1189 deed. It was part of fragmented Poland under the Piast dynasty. In 1255, it was granted town rights by Duke Henry III the White. From the 13th century onwards, the area was largely settled by Germans in the course of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;. From the 13th century, it had a coin mint. In the 13th century Oleśnica was part of the Duchy of Silesia, in 1294 it became part of the Duchy of Głogów and in 1313 it became capital of the Duchy of Oleśnica, just partitioned from Głogów. By that time a hospital already existed in Oleśnica, mentioned in a document from 1307. From 1320/21 the former castellany served as the residence of the Piast duke Konrad I of Oleśnica; his son Duke Konrad II the Gray also inherited Koźle. The dukes of Oleśnica in the 14th century still claimed to be heirs of the entire Kingdom of Poland, even though they ruled only in their principality, which caused animosity from other Polish dukes in Silesia and monarchs of all Poland. Oleśnica was located on an important trade route which connected Wrocław with Kalisz and Toruń.

In 1329, Duke Konrad I was forced to accept the overlordship of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown, although he retained vast autonomy. Local Polish dukes granted numerous privileges to Oleśnica, and the Duchy of Oleśnica was still ruled from the town until the 1492 death of Duke Konrad X the White, last of the local Piasts. During the Hussite Wars, Oleśnica was invaded by the Hussites in 1432, and later Polish–Hussite negotiations took place there. During the Bohemian–Hungarian War local dukes switched sides several times. In 1469 they recognized the overlordship of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, in the 1470s Duke Konrad X sided with Bohemian King Vladislaus Jagiellon, in 1480 he recognized Hungarian suzerainty again, and then revolted in 1489. Afterwards it was again a Bohemian fief.
According to an agreement from 1491, the duchy was supposed to pass to future Polish King John I Albert, but eventually in 1495 it was sold to Duke Henry I of Münsterberg, son of the Bohemian (Czech) king George of Poděbrady. His grandson Duke John of Münsterberg-Oels established a gymnasium at Oleśnica in 1530. When the Czech Podiebrad family became extinct in 1647, town and duchy were inherited by the Swabian dukes of Württemberg, and in 1792 by the Welf dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

On September 11, 1535, a violent F4 tornado completely destroyed part of the town. The written account of this tornado was done by Dr. Alfred Wegener, which is in the CLIMDAT archive located at Leipzig University and the F4 rating on the Fujita scale was assigned by the European Severe Storms Laboratory.

In the 17th century, the Polish-German language border ran close to Oleśnica, including the town to the territory dominated by the Polish language. Polish religious writers Adam Gdacius (nicknamed &quot;Rey of Silesia&quot;) and Jerzy Bock published their works in Oleśnica.

In the 18th century, one of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route. As a result of the First Silesian War the Duchy of Oels (Oleśnica) came under suzerainty of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742. Following administrative reform in 1807 during the Napoleonic Wars, Oels became the seat of Landkreis Oels in the Province of Silesia, remaining capital of the Duchy of Oels (Oleśnica). In 1884 the duchy was incorporated into Prussia, itself part of Germany since the 1871 Prussian-led unification of Germany.

===20th century===
After World War I, Oels was included within the Province of Lower Silesia. Nazi Germany operated a prison in the town, and a forced labour camp for Italian, English, Yugoslavian, Belgian and Polish prisoners of war during World War II. Dozens of Polish resistance members, including women, were held in the local prison, and at least 14 were sentenced to death in the town in 1942. The German administration evacuated almost the entire population, leaving only a few Germans and the forced laborers. The town was heavily damaged by the Red Army in 1945 in the final stages of World War II, having approximately 60-80% of its buildings destroyed. The city was became again part of Poland after the Potsdam Conference under its historic Polish name &quot;Oleśnica&quot;. The remaining German-speaking population was subsequently expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement and the town was resettled with Poles many of whom were expelled from former eastern Poland annexed in 1945 by the Soviet Union. Some 3,000 Italians remained in the town until the end of 1945, and organized artistic shows to which they invited young Polish activists.

The majority of monuments in the Old Town have been rebuilt since the 1960s.

==Cuisine==
The officially protected traditional food of Oleśnica, as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland, is the Oleśnica wheat and rye gingerbread.

==Sports==
Football club Pogoń Oleśnica is based in the town. It played at the Polish second division in the 1990s.

<text>Oława (, , ) is a historic town in south-western Poland with 33,029 inhabitants (2019). It is situated in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, within the Wrocław metropolitan area. It is the seat of Oława County and of the smaller administrative district of Gmina Oława (although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town is an urban gmina in its own right).

==Etymology==
The name of the city comes from the Polish word root el-, ol-, which in Polish lands took also the form of oła-, meaning &quot;water&quot;. The association with water refers to the location of the settlement between two rivers: the Oder and the Oława, which are close to each other, but only connect in Wrocław, which is 27 km away. The location of the city between rivers, pools and forests, and at the same time in the place of crossing the Oder River, favored the creation of a market settlement of Ślęża, and later a stronghold, a town.

The locality was mentioned in the Old Polish, Latinized form of Oleva in a Latin document issued on August 12, 1201, by the chancellery of Pope Innocent III in Segni. In a document written in Latin by Henry I the Bearded from 1214, the city is mentioned under the name Olaua in the fragment Olauam et Odriczam. In a Latin document issued in Wrocław in 1269, signed by the Silesian duke Władysław of Wrocław, the town is mentioned under two names: Olawa oraz Olauia. Latin language contain much less lettres and sounds that Polish, that&#x27;s why many distorted versions of Polish, Slavic words, toponyms across Europe in various documents. 
In the Latin book Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis (Polish Book of Emoluments of the Bishopric of Wrocław) written in the times of Bishop Henry of Wierzbno in the years 1295–1305, the town is mentioned in the Latinized form Olavia. The town was mentioned in a Latin document from 1310, where the town was recorded as &quot;civitati Olavia versus Nyzam&quot;.
In 1613, the Polish regionalist from the region of Silesia and historian Mikołaj Henel mentioned the town in his Latin work on the geography of Śląsk (also known by the Latinized as &quot;Silesia&quot;), entitled Silesiographia giving two names Olavia and Olawa/Olaw.

==History==
Oława began to develop during the 11th or early 12th century at a site that was protected by the rivers Oder and Oława, when it was part of the Piast-ruled Kingdom of Poland. It was first mentioned as &quot;Oloua&quot; in a document of 1149 confirming Piotr Włostowic&#x27;s donation to the abbey of St. Vincent in Wrocław. In 1206 Oława became one of the residential towns of the dukes of the Silesian branch of the Piast dynasty, who also granted Oława the status of a town in 1234. As a result of the fragmentation of Poland, Oława at various times formed part of the duchies of Silesia, Legnica and Brzeg.
During its history Oława was destroyed completely three times. In 1241 it was destroyed during the first Mongol invasion of Poland, in 1448 by the Hussites, and again in 1634 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. After the Polish King Casimir III had renounced his rights on Silesia with the Treaty of Trenčín in 1335, Silesia became until 1806 a part of the Holy Roman Empire as a Bohemian fief, although the town remained under the rule of the Polish Piast dynasty as part of the Duchy of Legnica until 1675. In 1526, when the Habsburgs gained the Bohemian crown, Silesia came under Austrian suzerainty. In 1527 with the Reformation High German language came in use and with it the first usage of the version of the town&#x27;s name &quot;Ohlau&quot; is reported. Following the death of the last Silesian Piast duke George IV William of Legnica in 1675, Oława ceased to be a residence town. In spite of Habsburg political influence, in the 17th century, the town was still part of the territory dominated by the Polish language. Oława found itself again under Polish rule, when Polish prince James Louis Sobieski, son of King John III Sobieski, became duke of Oława in years 1691–1737. Together with most of Silesia, the town became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742.

The 18th and 19th centuries were a period of economic growth and Oława (then as &quot;Ohlau&quot;) became well known as a centre of tobacco-growing. In 1842 a railroad between Ohlau and Wrocław, the first in Silesia, was opened. Ethnic Polish traditions and population remained strong in the area. Poles smuggled large amounts of gunpowder through the town to the Russian Partition of Poland during the January Uprising in 1863. Folkorist Julius Roger noted local Polish folk songs in his 1863 work, and a substantial concentration of Poles in and around the town was still noted in 1896.

===20th century===
The historic town of Ohlau did not suffer any damage during World War I, however, in World War II about 60% of the buildings were destroyed. On 2 September 1939, a Polish PZL.23 Karaś bomber (scout) plane bombed a German factory in the city in the first attack on German territory after the German invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II the day before. During the war, the Germans established and operated two labour subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 prisoner-of-war camp in the town. At least five Polish resistance members were sentenced to death in the city by a German court in 1942. After Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, the town became again part of Poland.

After the war, a sizeable group of Polish Armenians displaced from Soviet-annexed eastern Poland settled in the town, and the first post-war mayor was Polish-Armenian Jakub Axentowicz. Oława also became a garrison town of the Soviet Red Army Northern Group of Forces and remained so until 1992.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Wrocław Voivodeship.

==Flag and coat of arms==

The flag of Oława presents the coat of arms of Oława, on a diagonally divided white-red background.

The coat of arms presents a white rooster on a red-shield background, looking to the left. There are two traditional hypotheses for the origin of the coat of arms:

#The symbol links in with Walloonian weavers; historically located in Oława&#x27;s land - and the coat of arms of Wallonia - a red rooster on a yellow background.
#The shield originates from the town coat of arms of the Czech knight family of Olav.

Neither hypothesis explains the look of the coat of arms in relation to Oława. 
The coat of arms of Oława is identical on the basis and content of the Kur coat of arms.

On the basis that the coat of arms of Oława is in relation to the Kur coat of arms, such hypothesis can be deemed highly agreeable. The Kur coat of arms can be linked to Jan of Kur, a knight of Konrad I of Głogów, being the owner of the village of Kurów Wielki in 1266, in the Polkowice County. The coat of arms can also be also traced back to the personage of Szyban von Der - the court adjudicator of Henry III of Głogów - erroneously equated to Szaban Tader, a castellan of the Świny Castle, mentioned in Franciszek Piekosiński&#x27;s book - &quot;Heraldyka polska wieków średnich&quot; - (&quot;Heraldry of Polish Middle Ages&quot;) published in Kraków, in 1899; where the document is sealed with the town&#x27;s coat of arms from 1300.

<text>Little Current is a community in the Town of Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands, Ontario, Canada, in the northeast end of Manitoulin Island. It is located at the namesake narrow channel, that connects the North Channel to the west with the Georgian Bay to the east.

Its name refers to the currents that flow through the narrow passage that separates Manitoulin from Goat Island.

== History ==
In the early 19th century, the location was an Anishinaabe settlement called Wewebijiwang, or known as Petit Courant by the Voyageurs. The site was regularly visited by traders from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company trading post at La Cloche. Its convenient location along the North Channel allowed the indigenous to trade with passing steamboats and provide accommodation to travellers. In 1856, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company tried to open a trading post there, even building a store, factor&#x27;s house, and wharf, but its license was withdrawn after residents complained about the threat the company would pose to their trade. In 1860, &quot;Wyabegwong&quot; had a population of 52, and was a &quot;vibrant fishing and trading community&quot;.

After the signing of the Manitoulin Treaty of 1862, the indigenous population was gradually relocated to reserves, such as Sucker Creek 23. In 1864, the population had risen to 79, consisting of a mix of natives and non-natives. That same year, its post office opened and the town site was surveyed, which were both given the name Shaftesbury at that time (but was never used except for some legal purposes). Throughout the 1860s, more non-native settlers arrived at Little Current, taking over the profitable steamboat trade from the indigenous. Reverent Jabez Sims noted at the time: &quot;The settlement of the Island by the whites has operated very much against the interests of the Indians.&quot; By 1870, the community had several wharfs, general stores, hotels, and an Anglican mission. In 1874, a small sawmill was built, followed by two larger mills in the mid-1880s.

In 1873, the Township of Howland, which included Little Current, was incorporated, with James Burnet as its first reeve. In 1890, Little Current separated from the township and was incorporated as a town, with Thomas Capman Sims as its first mayor. In 1892, a telegraph line was built to Little Current, and extended as a telephone system to most of Manitoulin.

In 1902, the place was described as:
In 1913, a swing bridge for the Algoma Eastern Railway was built over the Little Current channel, and the town became the western terminus of the rail line that connected it with Sudbury. The bridge was converted to dual train and automobile traffic in 1946, passenger service on mixed-trains discontinued in 1963, and the tracks were removed in the mid 1980s.

On January 1, 1998, the Town of Little Current was merged with the Township of Howland and unorganized small islands around Manitoulin to form the new Town of Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands.

==Demographics==
Private dwellings occupied by usual residents (2021): 565 (total dwellings: 728)

Mother tongue (2021):
* English as first language: 93.8%
* French as first language: 2.5%
* English and French as first language: 0.4%
* Other as first language: 2.1%

==Transportation==

Except for the seasonal ferry service at South Baymouth, all traffic to and from the island goes through the community, since the only bridge to Manitoulin Island is at Little Current. The Little Current Swing Bridge was built in 1913 as a railroad bridge, and converted to a single lane for automobile traffic. It is designated as an Ontario Heritage Bridge.

Ontario Highway 6 goes through Little Current.

<doc id="386922" wikidata="Q776609" url="?curid=386922" title="Battle of Arcole">
<text>The Battle of Arcole or Battle of Arcola (15–17 November 1796) was fought between French and Austrian forces southeast of Verona during the War of the First Coalition, a part of the French Revolutionary Wars. The battle saw a bold maneuver by Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s French Army of Italy to outflank the Austrian army led by József Alvinczi and cut off its line of retreat. The French victory proved to be a highly significant event during the third Austrian attempt to lift the siege of Mantua. Alvinczi planned to execute a two-pronged offensive against Bonaparte&#x27;s army. The Austrian commander ordered Paul Davidovich to advance south along the Adige River valley with one corps while Alvinczi led the main army in an advance from the east. The Austrians hoped to raise the siege of Mantua where Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser was trapped with a large garrison. If the two Austrian columns linked up and if Wurmser&#x27;s troops were released, French prospects were grim.

Davidovich scored a victory against Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois at Calliano and threatened Verona from the north. Meanwhile, Alvinczi repulsed one attack by Bonaparte at Bassano and advanced almost to the gates of Verona where he defeated a second French attack at Caldiero. Leaving Vaubois&#x27; battered division to contain Davidovich, Bonaparte massed every available man and tried to turn Alvinczi&#x27;s left flank by crossing the Adige. For two days the French assaulted the stoutly defended Austrian position at Arcole without success. Their persistent attacks finally forced Alvinczi to withdraw on the third day. That day Davidovich routed Vaubois, but it was too late. Bonaparte&#x27;s victory at Arcole permitted him to concentrate against Davidovich and chase him up the Adige valley. Left alone, Alvinczi threatened Verona again. But without his colleague&#x27;s support, the Austrian commander was too weak to continue the campaign and he withdrew again. Wurmser attempted a breakout, but his effort came too late in the campaign and had no effect on the result. The third relief attempt failed by the narrowest of margins.

== Background ==
===Armies===

The second relief attempt of the siege of Mantua ended badly for Austria when General Napoleon Bonaparte routed Feldmarschall Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser&#x27;s army at the Battle of Bassano. In the sequel, Wurmser marched for Mantua, evading French attempts to cut him off. He reached there with 16,000 soldiers on 12 September 1796, but was defeated and driven into the fortress by the French on the 15th. With Wurmser&#x27;s Austrians and the original garrison crowded into the encircled city, disease and hunger began exacting a serious toll on the garrison. Emperor Francis II of Austria appointed Feldzeugmeister József Alvinczi to lead a reconstituted field army in the third attempt to relieve Mantua. Alvinczi, Feldmarschall-Leutnant Paul Davidovich, General-major Johann Rudolf Sporck, and Major Franz von Weyrother drew up plans for a two-pronged offensive. The Friaul Corps was assigned to Feldmarschall-Leutnant Peter Vitus von Quosdanovich and directed to move west toward Verona. The Tyrol Corps was entrusted to Davidovich and ordered to advance south from the Alps to join Quosdanovich. Wurmser would break out from Mantua and attack the French field armies in the rear.
Quosdanovich&#x27;s 26,432-strong Friaul Corps was accompanied by Alvinczi as it moved west on Mantua from the Piave River. This force was formed into a 4,397-man Advance Guard under General-major Friedrich Franz Xaver Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, a 4,376-strong Reserve led by General-major Philipp Pittoni von Dannenfeld, and a Main corps supervised by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Giovanni Marchese di Provera. This last unit was subdivided into a 9,380-man First line consisting of the brigades of Generals-major Gerhard Rosselmini and Anton Lipthay de Kisfalud and an 8,279-strong Second line composed of brigades led by Generals-major Anton Schübirz von Chobinin and Adolf Brabeck. There were 54 line and 20 reserve artillery pieces with the Friaul Corps.

On 1 November 1796, Davidovich&#x27;s Tyrol Corps numbered 18,427 infantry and 1,049 cavalry. The corps was split into six brigade-size columns under Generals-major Johann Loudon, Joseph Ocskay von Ocsko, Sporck, and Josef Philipp Vukassovich and Colonel Seulen. Loudon commanded 3,915 infantry and 362 cavalry in Column 1, Ocskay led 4,200-foot soldiers and 463 horsemen in Column 2, Sporck directed 2,560 infantry in Column 3, Vukassovich supervised both Column 4 with 3,772-foot and 30 horse and Column 5 with 2,958-foot and 120 horse, and Seulen led 1,022 infantry and 74 cavalry in Column 6. The Tyrol Corps counted 40 line and 20 reserve guns.

Wurmser commanded 23,708 soldiers within Mantua. However, only 12,420 were reported as capable of taking the field. In addition, General-major Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky&#x27;s brigade occupied the upper Brenta River, connecting the wings under Davidovich and Quosdanovich. Mittrowsky commanded about 3,000 men.

Bonaparte deployed a 10,500-man division under General of Division Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois at Lavis to watch Davidovich. At Bassano, General of Division André Masséna&#x27;s 9,540 soldiers defended the line of the Brenta River. The 8,340 troops of General of Division Pierre Augereau covered the Adige River. General of Division Charles Edward Jennings de Kilmaine with 8,830 soldiers blockaded Wurmser&#x27;s large garrison in Mantua. General of Division François Macquard&#x27;s 2,750-man infantry reserve was posted at Villafranca di Verona while General of Division Thomas-Alexandre Dumas with 1,600 troopers of the cavalry reserve was stationed at Verona.

The Austrians went to a lot of trouble to conceal the strength of Davidovich&#x27;s corps from their enemies. The ruse was so successful that Bonaparte ordered Vaubois to advance and defeat his opponent so that he could shift 3,000 troops to help fight Alvinczi. On 2 November, Vaubois attacked Davidovich near Cembra, inflicting 1,116 casualties before retiring. Though the French suffered only 650 killed and wounded, this included 280 soldiers of the 85th Line Infantry Demi Brigade. This loss seems to have seriously damaged the unit&#x27;s morale. The next day, Vaubois pulled back to Calliano.

===Second Bassano and Calliano===

On 1 November, the Friaul Corps began crossing the Piave. Bonaparte elected to attack the Austrians on the Brenta and called Augereau and Macquard east to join Masséna. In the Second Battle of Bassano on 6 November, the Austrians held off Bonaparte&#x27;s attacks. French losses numbered 3,000 killed, wounded, and missing, plus an additional 508 men and one howitzer captured. In this hard-fought engagement, the Austrians lost 534 killed, 1,731 wounded, and 558 captured for a total of 2,823 casualties. Bonaparte quickly pulled back to Verona.

Davidovich attacked Vaubois at the Battle of Calliano on 6 November but was repulsed after hard fighting. He renewed his assault at daybreak on the 7th. After holding out all day, French morale collapsed in the late afternoon and Vaubois&#x27; men fled the battlefield in a panic. Between 2 and 7 November, Vaubois&#x27; division suffered 4,400 killed, wounded, and missing and lost six artillery pieces. The Austrians also lost heavily, with 2,000 killed and wounded plus a further 1,500 taken prisoner. In a public announcement, Bonaparte vented his fury at the poor performance of the 39th and 85th Line Infantry Demi Brigades.

Poor communications plagued the Austrian commanders throughout the campaign. This was a consequence of the wide separation between the two wings. Furthermore, many of Alvinczi&#x27;s men were indifferently equipped raw recruits who straggled badly. The Austrians also suffered from a serious shortage of officers. After Alvinczi sent him a mistaken report that Masséna was reinforcing Vaubois, Davidovich became very cautious. The report was sent on 9 November but only reached its recipient on the 11th, which was typical of the Austrian communications problems. Alvinczi also repeatedly urged Davidovich to speed up his march toward Verona.

Alvinczi&#x27;s advance guard under GM Friedrich of Hohenzollern-Hechingen pressed toward Verona. Near that city, he encountered Masséna on 11 November and was forced to pull back after losing 400 men in a sharp combat. In a sleet storm on the 12th, Hohenzollern fought off the attacks of Masséna and Augereau in the Battle of Caldiero. When reinforcements under Brabeck, Schübirz, and Provera arrived later in the day, Bonaparte called off the futile attacks and drew his troops back within the walls of Verona. The Austrians reported losses of 1,244 officers and men. French losses were estimated at 1,000 killed and wounded, plus an additional 800 men and two guns captured.

=== Maneuver ===
After two sharp defeats, even Bonaparte &quot;became very despondent about his chances of survival.&quot; He deployed Macquard and 3,000 men to hold Verona. A slightly reinforced Vaubois clung to a strong position with about 8,000 troops, keeping Davidovich&#x27;s 14,000 soldiers bottled up in the Adige valley. To blockade Wurmser&#x27;s garrison within Mantua, Kilmaine could count only 6,626 men after providing reinforcements to other commands. This left Bonaparte a field force consisting of Masséna&#x27;s 7,937, Augereau&#x27;s 6,000, a reserve of 2,600 infantry plus cavalry, for a total of 18,000 soldiers. By this time, Alvinczi&#x27;s main force numbered about 23,000 men. Historian David G. Chandler wrote,

Like a juggler keeping three balls in the air at once, Bonaparte had to balance the dangers of the three sectors against each other, keeping them in clear relative perspective. Although he had singled out Alvinczi as his main target, it was only too clear that an aggressive move on the part of Davidovich or even by Wurmser might compel the French to abandon their operations against the main Austrian army and move every available man to reinforce the threatened area. Defeat on any sector could well spell catastrophe and the destruction of the Army of Italy.

Unknown to the French, Alvinczi planned to throw a pontoon bridge across the Adige below Verona at Zevio on 15 November at nightfall. Meanwhile, Bonaparte determined on an audacious strategy. He force-marched Masséna and Augereau along the west bank of the Adige to a bridging site at Ronco all&#x27;Adige, behind Alvinczi&#x27;s left flank. Once he moved his army across the river, he planned to move north to cut the Austrian line of retreat and seize the enemy&#x27;s trains and artillery park.

On the far bank was an area of marshy land that troops could not penetrate, which meant that all movement was limited to the causeways or dikes on the banks of the river Adige, and the causeways on the banks of a small tributary called the Alpone River that flowed into it from the north. The Alpone was only wide and deep. In the difficult terrain, the French soldiers might have an advantage. Further, the Austrians would not be able to use their superior numbers in the restricted battlefield.

From Ronco, the north-bound road followed a dike for about to a bridge, on the east side of which was the village of Arcole. From there, the road continued going north on the east bank of the stream to San Bonifacio near the main highway. The dikes along the Alpone near Arcole were &quot;26 feet high, and had very steep faces.&quot; Another road followed a dike from Ronco northwest to Belfiore and on to Caldiero.

== Battle ==

=== First day ===
By dawn on 15 November, Bonaparte&#x27;s troops reached the intended crossing, and soon afterward Chef de brigade (Colonel) Antoine-François Andréossy&#x27;s engineers had a pontoon bridge in operation. Augereau&#x27;s division crossed first and headed east and north toward Arcole. Masséna&#x27;s soldiers followed and, to cover the left flank, took a causeway leading north and west toward Belfiore di Porcile.

Alvinczi posted Oberst (Colonel) Wenzel Brigido&#x27;s four battalions in the area; of these, two battalions and two cannons defended Arcole. These troops repulsed Augereau&#x27;s leading demi-brigade under General of Brigade Louis André Bon. Before long, most of the French soldiers were lying in the lee of the causeway to shelter from the searing fire. Brigido pulled every available man into the combat. Augereau threw in demi-brigades led by Generals of Brigade Jean-Antoine Verdier and Pierre Verne. At mid-day, Austrian reinforcements led by General-Major Anton Ferdinand Mittrowsky began arriving to help the defenders. Soon, Bon, Verdier, Verne and General of Brigade Jean Lannes were all wounded and the attack completely stalled.

On the western flank, Alvinczi sent the brigades of Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel) Alois von Gavasini and General-Major Adolf Brabeck to seize the French pontoon bridge. They collided with Masséna near Bionde, midway between Belfiore and Ronco. Initially successful, the Austrians were soon driven back beyond Belfiore after Brabeck&#x27;s troops accidentally fired on Gavasini&#x27;s men, causing a panic. Once they reached Belfiore, the French watched as the Austrian trains rolled east on the main highway, out of their reach.

Attempting to break the stalemate near Arcole, Bonaparte ordered General of Brigade Jean Joseph Guieu with two demi-brigades to boat across the Adige below its confluence with the Alpone at Albaredo d&#x27;Adige. He also sent a French battalion across the Alpone by boat near its mouth. The latter unit fought its way north along the east bank dike.

Trying to inspire his men to attack, Bonaparte grabbed a flag and stood in the open on the dike &quot;about 55 paces&quot; from the bridge. He remained miraculously untouched, but several members of his staff were hit by the intense fire and his aide-de-camp, Jean-Baptiste Muiron, was killed. An unknown officer dragged Bonaparte out of the line of fire and the commanding general ended up in the muddy ditch.

Adding to the confusion, the Austrians launched a sortie from Arcole and defeated the French battalion on the east bank. In the evening, Guieu crossed at Albaredo and eventually managed to flush the Austrian defenders out of Arcole. At midnight, worried that Davidovich was about to fall upon his rear, Bonaparte withdrew Guieu from Arcole and pulled most of his troops back across the Adige. He left a garrison on the Austrian side of the river to hold his bridgehead.

=== Second day ===
Alvinczi left Hohenzollern&#x27;s troops near Verona to guard against an attack from that city. The Austrian leader ordered Provera with six battalions to attack from Belfiore. Alvinczi reinforced Mittrowsky to a total of 14 battalions, including the brigades of Schübirz and Oberst Franz Sticker, and instructed him to advance south from Arcole. The two forces would march at dawn on 16 November and converge on the French bridgehead. Alvinczi sent two battalions to guard Albaredo against a repetition of Guieu&#x27;s attack.

Provera&#x27;s effort came to grief when he ran into Masséna. Brabeck was killed during the encounter and the Austrians were chased back to Belfiore with the loss of five cannons. During the morning, Mittrowsky and Augereau engaged in a see-saw battle that ended when the Austrians fell back to Arcole.

Mittrowsky positioned Sticker&#x27;s four battalions on the western dike, lined the eastern dike with four battalions under Brigido, and packed the rest of his troops into Arcole. These intelligent dispositions blocked Bonaparte&#x27;s repeated attempts to seize the village during the day. French attempts to cross the Adige at Albaredo and the Alpone near its mouth both failed. At nightfall, Bonaparte withdrew Masséna and Augereau toward the bridgehead, but sizable forces stayed on the Austrian side of the Adige.

The former slave Joseph Hercule Domingue, French cavalry lieutenant, was promoted to captain and given a ceremonial sword by Bonaparte for his actions in executing a surprise attack on the Austrian cavalry on this day of the battle.

=== Third day ===
On 17 November, Alvinczi withdrew Hohenzollern to Caldiero, closer to his main body. Again, Provera held Belfiore while Mittrowsky defended Arcole. During the night, Bonaparte&#x27;s engineers floated some pontoons into the Alpone where they built a bridge near its mouth. Augereau&#x27;s division crossed the bridge and began fighting its way along the eastern dike. A French battalion and some cavalry also set out from Legnago and joined Augereau later in the day. Meanwhile, two of Masséna&#x27;s demi-brigades led by General of Brigade Jean Gilles André Robert attacked along the western dike.

By early afternoon, Masséna drubbed Provera near Belfiore again. Alvinczi recalled both Provera and Hohenzollern toward the east and began feeding some of the latter&#x27;s troops into the combat at Arcole. There, the battle went back and forth all day. At 3:00 pm, a large column of Austrian reinforcements surged out of Arcole and drove back the troops under Robert. Augereau&#x27;s men on the east bank saw this development and also fell back. By 4:00 pm, Augereau&#x27;s rattled division pulled back across the pontoon bridge to the west bank.

Just when the day seemed lost, Masséna appeared with reinforcements from the western flank. With these, he ambushed the Austrians on the western dike and sent them reeling back toward Arcole. Heartened, Augereau&#x27;s men recrossed to the east bank of the Alpone and renewed the fight. Masséna and Augereau finally battled their way into Arcole around 5:00 pm. A lieutenant and 25 Guides aided the final attack by riding into the Austrian rear area and blowing several bugles to create the impression of a large force. The French followed up their success by advancing north and threatening to block the main east-west highway. Alvinczi threw in Schübirz&#x27;s brigade to hold off the French, and this allowed Provera&#x27;s division to escape to the east.

== Aftermath ==
French losses at Arcole numbered 3,500 dead and wounded, plus 1,300 captured or missing. The Austrians suffered only 2,200 dead and wounded, but 4,000 men and 11 guns were captured by the French. On the French side, General Jean Gilles André Robert was mortally wounded, while Austrian General-Major Gerhard Rosselmini died in Vicenza on 19 November. On 17 November, Davidovich finally attacked Vaubois at Rivoli. Ocskay&#x27;s brigade from Monte Baldo met Vukassovich&#x27;s brigade from the Adige gorge, and together they drove the French soldiers steadily back. After resisting all morning the French troops stampeded in the afternoon. Again, the 85th Line was among the first units to panic. The French lost 800 killed and wounded, plus 1,000 captured including Generals of Brigade Pascal Antoine Fiorella and Antoine Valette. Austrian casualties were 600. Vaubois pulled back toward Peschiera del Garda while Davidovich pursued as far as Castelnuovo del Garda. Bonaparte sent his cavalry to watch Alvinczi&#x27;s retreat, while turning the bulk of his forces toward Davidovich. On 19 November, Davidovich heard of the Austrian defeat at Arcole and detected signs that Bonaparte was about to fall upon him in full force. The Austrian pulled back to Rivoli on the 20th and began to fall back farther the next morning. At this moment, he received an encouraging note from Alvinczi and halted his retreat. But the French caught up with him at Rivoli. In the ensuing clash, the French suffered 200 casualties while inflicting losses of 250 killed and wounded. An additional 600 Austrians, three guns and a bridging train fell into French hands. Davidovich hastily fell back north. Altogether, Davidovich&#x27;s retreat from Rivoli cost him as many as 1,500 men and nine guns.

After Arcole, Alvinczi pulled back to Olmo where he held a council of war on the morning of 18 November. At this meeting, the Austrian generals gamely decided to return to the field with their 16,000 remaining troops. By 21 November, Alvinczi occupied Caldiero again but could go no farther. While there, he heard of Davidovich&#x27;s defeat on 23 November. That evening the Austrian field army began its retreat to the Brenta. During the three days that the battle of Arcole raged, cannon fire could be heard in Mantua. Observers in the fortress even noticed that some of the French camps seemed to be empty, yet Wurmser unaccountably failed to act. On 23 November, Wurmser assaulted the siege lines, capturing 200 Frenchmen and demolishing some earthworks. The Austrians suffered almost 800 casualties. When he learned that Davidovich was in full retreat, Wurmser withdrew into the city. In November 1796, the French seized Venice and two 44-gun frigates that were being built in the shipyard. One of the warships was named the &quot;Muiron&quot; in honor of Bonaparte&#x27;s aide who was killed at his side on 15 November. When Bonaparte returned from Egypt in 1799, he escaped to France on the &quot;Muiron&quot;. Napoleon&#x27;s actions at the bridge of Arcole were quickly turned legendary by French artists and newspapers, making Napoleon a household name among the French. Thus, Arcole is widely regarded as the beginning of the Napoleonic legend, which would last until Napoleon&#x27;s downfall in 1815.

<text>Świebodzice (; ) is a town in south-western Poland with 22,793 inhabitants (). It is situated in Świdnica County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship.

The town is situated close to Książ Castle, which during World War II, together with the cave complex, was expanded to create private quarters for Adolf Hitler.

==History==
===Medieval period===

The town dates back to the medieval Kingdom of Poland. By 1220, there was a populous settlement. A Romanesque church was built during the rule of Duke Henry the Bearded, and consecrated by Bishop Wawrzyniec of Wrocław in 1228. In 1243, Merboto de Czertheres, knight and close friend of Duke Bolesław II the Horned, was granted the local castle. The castle was a defensive point against possible Czech invasions, however, it lost its importance after the construction of the nearby Książ Castle by Duke Bolko I the Strict. It was granted town rights by 1279, as it was mentioned as a town by Duke Henry Probus that year. In 1291, defensive walls were erected and a guild organization was established. The town received its coat of arms either in 1291 or 1337. Town rights were revoked in 1310 and restored in 1337.

In 1427, the town withstood three attacks by the Hussites. King Vladislaus II established the annual so-called warm fair and an annual weekly markets in 1492 and 1510, respectively.

===Modern period===
In 1615–1617, part of the population died due to the epidemic. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was occupied by Swedish troops in 1633, then it was occupied and plundered twice by the Imperial troops in 1634–1635. In 1639, part of the town wall was made higher. Swedish and Imperial forces clashed in the area further several times in 1642–1648. The town suffered fires in 1640, 1680, 1681, 1688 and 1774. In 1702, the weekly market was moved from Mondays to Tuesdays. The town&#x27;s first grain market was held in 1706. As of 1740, the town had 18 guilds.

Several clashes of the Silesian Wars took place in the town and its vicinity. In 1741, the town was occupied and then annexed by Prussia. In 1745, it was the site of a battle between Prussians, Austrians and Hungarians, and then was recaptured by Prussians. In 1757, it was captured by the Austrians, who made it their headquarters during the siege of nearby Świdnica, and the location of a military hospital. In December 1757, Prussian troops recaptured the town and brought an epidemic that resulted in the deaths of about 1,000 residents. 
In early 1758 the town was the main headquarters of the Prussian Army and was visited by King Frederick the Great, and afterwards a small Prussian garrison remained stationed in the town. On 22 June 1759, the Austrians won another battle against the Prussians, but soon retreated, and the town was once again garrisoned by the Prussians. Austrians returned in June 1760, then the Prussians in November 1760. In 1762 fights occured again.

During the Napoleonic Wars, in 1807–1808, allied French, Württemberg, Bavarian and Saxon soldiers were stationed in the town. In 1809, a linen and cloth factory was established, employing more than 1,300 people. Various armies passed through the town in 1812–1813. The town received a railroad connection to Wrocław and Wałbrzych in 1843 and 1853, respectively. In 1848, it was visited by poet Juliusz Słowacki. A clock factory and a merchant and craft bank were established in 1847 and 1862, respectively. A military hospital was located in the town during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. A new water supply system was built and electric street lighting was launched in 1895–1897 and 1898, respectively.

===20th century===

Many of the town&#x27;s residents participated and died in World War I. The townspeople collected donations for the Red Cross and a hospital for wounded soldiers was established in the town.

During World War II, local industry was subordinated to German armaments needs. The Germans established and operated a forced labour camp for Jewish men and a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, in which a total of more than 1,000 Jewish women were subjected to forced labour. The retreating Germans dismantled and transported equipment from local factories to the west.

After the war, still in 1945, factories for electrical machinery, linen, home appliances, chocolate and furniture resumed work, and a food cooperative, cinema, elementary school and kindergarten were established. In 1951, a rope and technical cord factory and a brewery were opened. In 1952, the Famalen Textile Industry Machine Repair Plant was established. In 1953 Pełcznica, and in 1973 Ciernie, were included within the town limits as its new districts. From 1975 to 1998, Świebodzice was administratively located in the Wałbrzych Voivodeship. In 1976, new neighborhoods of single-family houses Metalowiec and Wilcza Góra were built. The town was struck by the 1997 Central European flood, which resulted in one person drowning and material damage estimated at 7 million złotys.

<text>Nowa Ruda () is a town in south-western Poland near the Czech border, lying on the Włodzica river in the central Sudetes mountain range. it had 22,067 inhabitants. The town is located in Kłodzko County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship. It is the seat of the rural district of Gmina Nowa Ruda, but is not part of its territory (the town is a separate urban gmina in its own right).

==History==
===Under Polish and Bohemian rule===

A medieval village situated in the rich Kłodzko Valley, Nowa Ruda developed in the mid-13th century as part of the Kingdom of Bohemia. German-speaking immigrants settled there as part of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot;. The oldest known mention of the settlement comes from 1337 from a document issued in nearby Kłodzko, when it was part of the Polish Piast-ruled Duchy of Ziębice/Münsterberg under the suzerainty of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown of the Holy Roman Empire. It passed directly to Bohemia in the next decades. Officially, the settlement was granted a city charter in 1363 and received the name of &quot;Newenrode&quot;. In the Late Middle Ages, weaving, clothmaking and shoemaking developed in the town. In the years 1427-1429 the town was invaded by the Hussites. The city was rechartered under a local variant of the Magdeburg Law in 1434 and then again in 1596. From 1459 it was part of the Bohemian-ruled County of Kladsko. The city was invaded and devastated again during the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1622.

===Under Prussia and Germany===
In 1742 it passed to Prussia. In the second half of the 19th century the town developed due to coal mining and the textile industry. In 1884 it suffered a great fire. During World War I, the Germans operated three forced labour camps for Allied prisoners of war at local coal mines. After World War I, it suffered an economic crisis. The town was no longer a district seat after 1932, when it was reincorporated into the &quot;Landkreis Glatz&quot; (Kłodzko district).

During World War II, the Germans established three labour units for French, Belgian and Soviet prisoners of war, as well as two forced labour camps. Also during the war, the largest mining disaster in the town&#x27;s history took place; 187 miners were killed.

===After World War II===
Following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II the region became part of Poland, and the town took on its present name, with the German population being expelled in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. It was repopulated by Poles, expellees from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union, settlers from central Poland and miners returning from France. In 1973 the settlement of Słupiec was included within the town limits as a new district. In 1976 and 1979 mining disasters occurred, in which 17 and 7 miners respectively died. After the adoption of Ostpolitik by the German Chancellor Willy Brandt, the former German inhabitants were allowed to travel to their hometowns and tried to establish relations with the current population and the Holy See redrew the boundaries of the ecclesiastical provinces along the post-war borders. On 28 June 1972 the Catholic parishes of Nowa Ruda were transferred from the traditional Hradec Králové diocese (est. 1664; Ecclesiastical Province of Bohemia) to the Archdiocese of Wrocław.

From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively located in the former Wałbrzych Voivodeship.

The area was notable in the Middle Ages as a source of rich iron ore deposits. Until 2000 there was also a coal mine and a gabbro mine in Nowa Ruda&#x27;s borough of Słupiec.

==Transport==
There is a train station in Nowa Ruda. The Voivodeship roads 381, 384 and 385 pass through the town.

<text>Kłodzko (; ; ; ) is a historic town in south-western Poland, in the region of Lower Silesia. It is situated in the centre of the Kłodzko Valley, on the Eastern Neisse (Nysa Kłodzka) river.

Kłodzko is the seat of Kłodzko County (and of the rural Gmina Kłodzko, although the town itself is a separate urban gmina), and is situated in Lower Silesian Voivodeship. With 25,717 inhabitants at the 2021 Census, Kłodzko is the main commercial centre as well as an important transport and tourist node for the area.

For its historical monuments it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Little Prague&quot; (). It was established as a settlement in the 10th century, and is one of the oldest towns in Poland, having been granted city rights in 1233. Culturally and traditionally a part of Bohemia, administratively it has been periodically part of Silesia in the Middle Ages and again permanently since 1763.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The area of present-day Kłodzko has been populated at least since the 1st century BC. There are several archaeological sites both in and around the town that indicate that there must have been a settlement located on the ancient Amber Road that conducted extensive trade relations with the Roman Empire.

===Medieval Bohemia and Poland===
The earliest mention of the town is in the 12th-century &quot;Chronicle of Bohemians&quot; by Cosmas of Prague. He mentions the town of &quot;Cladzco&quot; as belonging to duke Slavník, father of Adalbert of Prague, in 981. Initially in Bohemia, together with the Kłodzko Land, it changed affiliation several times, passing between Poland and Bohemia in a series of conflicts which in turn devastated the town completely by the beginning of the 12th century. In 1114 Bohemian Duke Soběslav I captured and burnt the town to the ground, but he rebuilt it shortly afterwards. He also rebuilt and strengthened the castle located on a high rock overlooking the town. After the of 1137, Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth of Poland ceded all claims to the Kłodzko Land to the Bohemian Duchy (later Kingdom).

In 1241, Klodzko became the site of a Mongol raid during the Mongol invasion of Europe. However, King Wenceslaus I managed to rally his troops and drove the Mongols out, saving much of Bohemia from Mongol conquest. The town was granted German city rights under Magdeburg Law between 1253 and 1278, though the exact date is unknown. In 1278 it came under Polish rule again, as it was taken over by Duke Henry Probus of Wrocław, from 1288 High Duke of Poland, who claimed the entire Bohemian Kingdom after the death of Ottokar II of Bohemia. In 1290 it was sold to the Dukes of Świdnica and then, in 1301, it was sold to the Dukes of Ziębice. However, in 1334, Duke Bolko II of Ziębice sold the town back to the Kingdom of Bohemia. The same year Bohemian king John of Luxembourg, relocated the town, which led to a period of fast growth, bringing German settlers to the town. A city hall was built in 1341, and in the following year a brick factory was opened. From 1366, the town has been protected by a group of professional firemen. The town gained significant profits from its location on the ancient road from Bohemia to Poland through mountain passes in the Sudetes.

German Augustinian monks were invited to the city and, in 1376, most streets were paved with stone setts. The Augustinian abbey became one of the most important centres of culture in the region – for example, in 1399 one of the earliest texts in the Polish language, the St. Florian&#x27;s Psalter (&quot;Psałterz Floriański&quot;), was written here. In 1390 a Gothic stone bridge over the Młynówka River (local branch of Eastern Neisse River) was built by the local lord.

===County seat within Bohemia===

Kladsko developed rapidly until the start of the Hussite Wars in the 15th century. The wars left the town depopulated by plagues, partially burnt, and demolished by several consecutive floods. In 1459 whole Kłodzko Land was elevated by Bohemian king George of Poděbrady to the status of county – thus the city became a seat of Count (for most of time ruler of Bohemia itself) and local Diet – but still remained integral part of Bohemia as &quot;outer region&quot; (), and was not counted as part of Silesia. In 1472, the Polish prince Vladislaus Jagiellon stayed in the city before his coronation as King of Bohemia in Prague.

In 1526 the Habsburgs succeeded after the Jagiellons as hereditary kings of Bohemia. Thus the County of Kladsko became a part of the Habsburg monarchy; the local counts retained their powers and Bohemian kings (i.e. Habsburg emperors) ruled this land as suzerains. It was not until the 16th century that the local economy began to recover from the previous wars. In 1540 the sewer system was built. In 1549 the remaining streets were paved and the city hall was refurbished. Most of the houses surrounding the town square were rebuilt in a pure Renaissance style.

In 1617 the first census was organised in the County of Kladsko. The city itself had approximately 1,300 houses and over 7,000 inhabitants. However, two years after the census took place the Thirty Years&#x27; War started. Between 1619 and 1649 the fortress was besieged several times. Although the fortress was never captured, the city itself was largely destroyed. Over 900 out of 1,300 buildings were destroyed by fire and artillery and the population dropped by more than a half. After the war the Austrian authorities put an end to all local self-government, and the County of Glatz existed in name only. The city was gradually converted into a small garrison town attached to the ever-growing fortress.

===Kingdom of Prussia===

The Kingdom of Prussia annexed Glatz during the 18th century Silesian Wars, although Austrian influence is still evident in the architecture and culture of the region. The construction of the fortress was continued and the town had to bear the costs of the fortress expansion. In 1760 the town was captured by Austrian forces in the Siege of Glatz, but was subsequently returned to Prussia.

Unlike most of Prussian Silesia, Glatz resisted French bombardment during the War of the Fourth Coalition. In 1826, Fryderyk Chopin travelled through the town. During the 19th-century Polish national liberation fights, Polish publicist , Polish historian Wojciech Kętrzyński and Polish priest were imprisoned in the fortress.

===Germany===
Glatz became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. The restrictions in the city&#x27;s growth were not withdrawn until 1877, after which the town began another period of rapid modernisation and expansion. Some of the forts were demolished, several new bridges were built, and new investments started to arrive in Glatz. The town was connected to the rest of Germany by a railway. In 1864 the gas works were built and in 1880 an electric plant was opened. The buildings along the main streets were rebuilt in Neo-Gothic and Neo-Renaissance style while the city walls with all their gates were demolished. In 1884–1885 a new synagogue was built on the &quot;Grünestraße&quot; [Green Street], designed by the Breslau architect .

The end of the 19th century saw the Kłodzko Valley turned into one of the most popular tourist regions. Many hotels, sanatoria, and spa were opened to the public in the nearby towns of Bad Reinerz (Duszniki Zdrój), Habelschwerdt (Bystrzyca Kłodzka), Bad Altheide (Polanica Zdrój), and Bad Landeck (Lądek-Zdrój). The area of the former county became a popular place among the rich bourgeoisie of Breslau (Wrocław), Berlin, Vienna, and Kraków. In 1910 the city had 17,121 inhabitants: 13,629 Roman Catholics, 3,324 Protestants (mostly members of the Evangelical State Church of Prussia&#x27;s older Provinces), and 150 Jews.

In September 1938 Glatz was severely damaged by &quot;the flooding of the century&quot;, but the damage done was quickly repaired. During the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (9 November 1938), the synagogue was destroyed by an arson attack of Nazis. Most of the Jews emigrated and by 1939 there were only 25 of them left.

====Czech claims====
The Kłodzko Valley region on the Eastern Neisse River was the focus of several attempts to reincorporate the area into Czechoslovakia after the First World War even though it had a German majority. From the Czech perspective, Kłodzko and Kłodzko Land are culturally and traditionally a part of Bohemia, although the region has been a part of Lower Silesia since its conquest by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1763. These efforts to incorporate Kłodzko into Czechoslovakia would continue into the period after World War II.

====World War II====

During World War II, the fortress was changed into a prison administered by the Reich Ministry of Justice and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. It housed prisoners of various nationalities, including Allied prisoners of war. In 1941–1942, many prisoners were sent to forced labour in various locations in German-occupied Poland, Czechoslovakia and Austria, and in 1942–1943, six FStGA field penal battalions (1, 7, 10, 13, 16, 20) were established in the town and afterwards relocated to the Eastern Front. In November 1942 and January 1943, the town was the site of a German trial of 39 members of the &quot;Związek Orła Białego&quot; Polish resistance organization, 18 of which were sentenced to death. 198 prisoners were deported from the prison to various Nazi concentration camps, chiefly Gross-Rosen. Presumably only two men, a Pole and a Russian, managed to escape from the prison (on 23 September 1944). Beginning in 1944, the casemates housed the AEG arms factory evacuated from Łódź, in which some 1,500 Poles were subjected to slave labour. The stronghold was turned into a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. The Germans also established and operated eight forced labour subcamps of the Stalag VIII-B/344 POW camp in the town.

In January and February 1945, many prisoners from other locations, including Katowice, Racibórz, Brzeg and Nysa, were brought to the local prison either during death marches or transports, and many were then sent further west to Bautzen.

The town itself was not damaged by the war and was taken over by the Soviet Red Army without a major battle on 9 May 1945. However, all the bridges, except the Gothic stone bridge of 1390, were destroyed.

===Modern Poland===

After the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945, the town became part of Poland under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, which transferred most of Silesia to Poland. The Polish took over administration in June 1945. German sources report that oppression immediately began. Evictions of the surrounding villages began in winter 1945/46, while Germans of Glatz were deported in February 1946, in accordance to the Potsdam Agreement. The town was repopulated by Poles, some of whom were Polish refugees from former eastern Polish territories annexed by the Soviet Union, from where they had been displaced by Soviet authorities in accordance to new borders decreed at Yalta Conference, while most came from war-devastated central Poland. In May 1945 Czechoslovakia tried to annex the area on behalf of Czech minority (living especially in the western part of the land, called &quot;Czech Corner&quot;) and historical claims, but under pressure from the Soviet Union the Czech minority was expelled to Czechoslovakia. 

On 20 August 1946, the town was struck by a large tornado, rated by the European Severe Storms Laboratory (ESSL) to have been F2–F4 intensity on the Fujita scale. The ESSL documented the path length of the tornado at with a maximum width of and noted, &quot;to less information to&quot; assign a solid rating for the tornado.

In the 1950s and 1960s much of the town centre was damaged by landslides. It turned out that throughout the city&#x27;s history, generations of Kłodzko&#x27;s merchants had developed an extensive net of underground basements and tunnels. They were used for storage and, in times of trouble, as a safe shelter from artillery fire. With time the tunnels were forgotten, especially after the original German population was deported, and during the years after World War II many of them started to collapse, along with the houses above. Since the 1970s the tunnels were conserved and the destruction of the city was stopped. Another disaster happened in 1997, when the city was damaged by flooding even greater than that of 1938. However, the town quickly recovered. The town was badly affected by the 2024 Central European floods.

On 28 June 1972, the Catholic parishes of Kłodzko were redeployed from the traditional Hradec Králové diocese (est. 1664; Ecclesiastical province of Bohemia) into the Archdiocese of Wrocław. From 1975 to 1998 Kłodzko was administratively part of the former Wałbrzych Voivodeship.

Currently, Kłodzko is one of centres of culture, commerce and tourism in Lower Silesia.

== Climate ==
The climate is semicontinental although officially it is considered as oceanic (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), near of the humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;), considered as such by the isotherm of 0 °C. Located in western Poland where there is the clash of marine air masses and the interior of Siberia, they collide and generate a highly variable climate, although the patterns of the west are predominant.

<text>Bielawa () is a town in southwestern Poland. Since 1999, it has been situated in Dzierżoniów County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship. From 1975 to 1998, it was part of the Wałbrzych Voivodeship. As of January 1, 2023, it has a population of 28 344.

Bielawa lies in the central part of Lower Silesia, along the Bielawica stream in the Owl Mountains region. The town covers an area in excess of .

Bielawa lies at an altitude range of 280 and 964 m above sea level, in the Owl Mountains. The town is a year-round tourist destination; its outdoor attractions include four major hiking trails of varying difficulty in an park, as well as cycling trails and ski lifts.

==Etymology==
The name is of Polish origin and is derived from the word &quot;biela&quot;, &quot;bila&quot;, current Polish &quot;biała&quot; (&quot;white&quot;).

==History==
The oldest known mention of Bielawa dates back to 1288, when it was part of fragmented Piast-ruled Poland.

In 1720 the first brick house was built in the village and in 1741 it was captured and afterwards annexed by Prussia. In 1805 Christian Dierig founded a weaving company (&quot;Christian Dierig AG&quot;). During the Napoleonic Wars, the village was occupied by France. In 1844 it was the site of the Weavers&#x27; Uprising, brutally crushed by the Prussians. From 1871 to 1945 it was part of Germany. In 1891 the Dzierżoniów–Bielawa railway line opened. In 1924 Bielawa obtained town rights. During World War II the Germans established the &quot;FAL Langenbielau II&quot; subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in the town. In 1945 it was captured by the Soviets and eventually reintegrated with Poland. Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in Bielawa in the 1950s.

==Demographics==
==Main sights==
There are numerous historical buildings in Bielawa. At its center is the 19th-century Neo-Gothic Church of the Assumption with a 101 m tall tower, the third tallest in Poland. Other buildings include a late-Renaissance palace originally built as a fortified manor house; the Church of the Corpus Christi, erected in 1743; and numerous 18th-century Baroque houses that were restored in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

<text>Dzierżoniów (; until 1946 ; ) is a town located at the foot of the Owl Mountains in southwestern Poland, within the Lower Silesian Voivodeship. It is the seat of Dzierżoniów County, and of Gmina Dzierżoniów (although it is not part of the territory of the latter, since the town forms a separate urban gmina).

Established in the 13th century, Dzierżoniów is a historical Lower Silesian town that covers an area of , and as of December 2021 it has a population of 32,346. It is named after Polish priest and scientist Jan Dzierżon.

Unique and architecturally rich, Dzierżoniów features a central market square with elegant tenements and a town hall as well as few museums and restaurants. The Old Town is a venue for several annual events and fairs.

==History==
In its early history until 1945, the town was known as &quot;Reichenbach&quot;; composed of the German words &quot;reich&quot; (rich, strong) and &quot;Bach&quot; (stream), it refers to the current of the Piława River. The name was rendered in Polish as &quot;Rychbach&quot;. To differentiate between other places named Reichenbach, the Lower Silesian town became known in German as &quot;Reichenbach im Eulengebirge&quot;, or &quot;Reichenbach in the Owl Mountains&quot;.

===Middle Ages===

In the early Middle Ages, the area was inhabited by the tribe of Silesians. After short periods of Great Moravian and Czech rule, in the 10th century the region became part of the emerging Polish state.

Reichenbach was first mentioned in a document dating to 13 February 1258. The parish Church of St. George was also noted early on. The town was part of various Piast-ruled duchies of fragmented Poland. The coat of arms, depicting Saint George slaying a dragon, was used by 1290 at the latest. The town passed successively from the Bishopric of Wrocław, to the Duchy of Ziębice, and to the Duchy of Świdnica-Jawor. The Knights Hospitaller built a school and hospital in the town in 1338. In 1392 the town became part of the Kingdom of Bohemia. It was plundered by the Hussites during the 15th-century Hussite Wars.

===Early modern era===

The Habsburg monarchy of Austria inherited the Bohemian throne in 1526 and became the town&#x27;s new lords. Reichenbach developed into a trading center, especially for textiles and linen, during the 16th century. In 1606, some 2,000 people died during an epidemic. The town suffered during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), and was plundered by Swedish and Imperial troops in 1633 and 1634, respectively.

After the First Silesian War in 1742, most of Silesia, including Reichenbach, became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1762 during the Seven Years&#x27; War, the region between Reichenbach and Schweidnitz (Świdnica) was the setting for the Battle of Burkersdorf between Prussia and Austria. It also saw the frustration of an Austrian attempt to relieve the Prussian Siege of Schweidnitz. In 1790 representatives from Austria, Britain, Poland, Prussia and the Dutch Republic met at Reichenbach to discuss the Ottoman wars in Europe. In 1800, the town was visited by future president of the United States John Quincy Adams.

===19th and 20th century===
In 1813, Tsar Alexander I of Russia met with King Frederick William III of Prussia here to organize the War of the Sixth Coalition. From 1816 to 1945 Reichenbach contained the district office for &quot;Landkreis Reichenbach&quot; (Reichenbach district). Until 1820 the town was the seat of a Prussian district president. In the 19th century, the town became one of the leading centers of textile production in Silesia. In 1848 the Silesian Weavers&#x27; Rebellion took place here. Reichenbach was connected to a rail network in 1855. It became part of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871.
During World War II, in 1944, the Germans established the &quot;FAL Reichenbach&quot; subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, mainly for Jewish women from the Netherlands. Beside the Rychbach subcamp there were another two in nearby towns. These camps were set up to provide slave labour for German industries where mainly Jewish inmates were worked to death. When the town was liberated by the Red Army on 8 May 1945, about 20,000 Jewish inmates had survived the camp, many of whom were Polish Jews. They did not want to go back to their hometowns because of the decimation of their Jewish communities and the fear of antisemitic violence. They were later joined by Polish Jews repatriated from the Soviet Union, and others who had survived in hiding in Poland or returned from concentration camps in Germany.

At its peak, there were 17,800 Jews in Dzierżoniów in November 1946 of the 50,000-Jew commune in Dzierżoniów County (incl. Bielawa, Pieszyce, Piława Górna, etc.) led by Jakub Egit from 1945 to 1948. One of the town&#x27;s synagogues survived the war and has been restored.

Reichenbach was transferred from Germany to Poland in 1945 after World War II. Many of its German inhabitants had fled earlier in 1945 before the war&#x27;s end, while most of those who had stayed were subsequently expelled. The void was filled by Poles moving in, some of whom from the eastern part of the country that had been annexed by the Soviet Union.

In the period immediately following World War II, the town was known by different names. The municipal office, the local office and the railway administration all used different names for it: Rychbach (its traditional Polish name), Reichenbach and Drobniszew. In one of the Polish Ministerial decrees of 1945, another name was used: &quot;Rychonek&quot;. In 1946 the town was renamed &quot;Dzierżoniów&quot; after the apiarist Jan Dzierżon; ironically, Germany also viewed Dzierżon as one of their own, and in 1936, as part of a Nazi effort to remove Slavic-sounding place names, his birthplace, Lowkowitz (now Łowkowice), was renamed &quot;Bienendorf&quot; (&quot;Bee village&quot;) in his honor.

The textile and electromechanical industry developed after the war. In 1945, the first radio receiver production company in post-war Poland, &quot;Zakłady Radiowe Diora&quot;, was founded in Dzierżoniów. Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in Dzierżoniów in the 1950s.
From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively located in the former Wałbrzych Voivodeship.

<doc id="386934" wikidata="Q5358138" url="?curid=386934" title="History of Hanover (region)">
<text>Hanover () is a territory that was at various times a principality within the Holy Roman Empire, an Electorate within the same, an independent Kingdom, and a subordinate Province within the Kingdom of Prussia. The territory was named after its capital, the city of Hanover, which was the principal town of the region from 1636. In contemporary usage, the name is used only for the city. Most of the historical territory of Hanover forms the greater part of the German state of Lower Saxony but excludes certain areas.

== Formation ==
Hanover was formed by the union of several dynastic divisions of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, with the sole exception of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. From 1714 to 1837, it was joined in a personal union with the United Kingdom, which terminated upon the accession in Britain of Queen Victoria, as in Hanover, a woman could not rule if there was a male descendant. Until 1803, when it was occupied by French and Prussian troops, Hanover was a constituent state of the Holy Roman Empire; when it regained independence in 1814, Hanover was raised to a kingdom, which lasted until 1866.

== Duchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg ==
The title &quot;Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg&quot; () was held, from 1235, by various members of the Welf family who ruled several small territories in northwest Germany. These holdings did not have all of the formal characteristics of a state, being neither compact nor indivisible. When several sons of a Duke competed for power, the lands were often divided between them; when a branch of the family lost power or became extinct, the lands were reallocated among surviving members of the family; different dukes might also exchange territories. The territories were named after notable towns where the dukes had (or had had at one time) their residences, e.g. Calenberg, Göttingen, Grubenhagen, Lüneburg, Wolfenbüttel. The unifying element of all these territories was that they were ruled by male-line descendants of Duke Otto I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, nephew of the Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV.

=== Principality of Lüneburg ===

The line that would lead to the House of Hanover was that of Bernard, one of the three sons of Duke Magnus II who had jointly ruled a united Duchy of Brunswick since 1388, but who partitioned the territory in 1428 and 1432. Bernard received the territory of Lüneburg, whose principal town was Celle.

From 1527 until 1642 the Principality of Harburg, seated in Harburg, was partitioned from Lüneburg. In 1569, Lüneburg was divided between Henry III (&quot;line of Dannenberg&quot;) and William VI (&quot;line of Lüneburg&quot;), the sons of Ernest the Confessor, Bernard&#x27;s great-great-grandson.

A distant cousin of the line of Lüneburg, Frederick Ulrich, who ruled the territories of Wolfenbüttel and Calenberg, died in 1634. After some dispute, his territories were divided in 1635 between the Dannenberg and Celle branches of the Lüneburg line. Henry III&#x27;s son Augustus became Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his descendants eventually ruled the Duchy of Brunswick.

William&#x27;s first four sons ruled Lüneburg in sequence from their father&#x27;s death in 1592 to 1648. The fifth son, George received the territories of Calenberg and Göttingen in 1635. In 1636 he moved the seat of the Dukes of Calenberg from Pattensen to the town of Hannover in the Calenberg territory. This was the nucleus of the state of Hanover, though the territory would have to wait until 1814 before receiving &quot;Hanover&quot; as its official name.

In 1648, the Duke of Calenberg inherited Lüneburg from his uncle Frederick, the last survivor of William&#x27;s five sons. From 1648 to 1705, Lüneburg (the larger territory) was held by the senior of the Lüneburg line, and Calenberg by the next junior.

In 1692, the Emperor promised to raise the Duke of Calenberg, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg to the rank of Elector. This promotion did not become effective until it was recognized by the Imperial Diet in 1708, ten years after Ernest Augustus&#x27;s death.

In the meantime, his son, George Louis, inherited Lüneburg from his uncle in 1705, doubling Hanover&#x27;s size.

== Electorate of Hanover 1708–1814 ==
In 1692, the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, elevated George&#x27;s son, Duke Ernest Augustus to the rank of Elector of the Empire as a reward for aid given in the Nine Years&#x27; War. There were protests against the addition of a new Elector, and the elevation did not become official (with the approval of the Imperial Diet) until 1708, in the person of Ernest Augustus&#x27;s son, George Louis. Though the Elector&#x27;s titles were properly &quot;Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg&quot; and &quot;Elector of the Holy Roman Empire&quot;, he is commonly referred to as the &quot;Elector of Hanover&quot; after his residence.

The Electorate was legally bound to be indivisible: it could add to its territory, but not alienate territory or be split up among several heirs; and its succession was to follow male primogeniture. The territory assigned to the Electorate included the Brunswick-Lüneburg principalities of Calenberg, Grubenhagen, and Lüneburg (even though at the time Lüneburg was ruled by Ernest Augustus&#x27;s older brother) and the counties of Diepholz and Hoya.

George Louis became king of Great Britain in 1714 (see House of Hanover). The influence of the electors in Germany grew also: they inherited the formerly Swedish territories of Bremen and Verden in 1719. As part of the German Mediatisation of 1803, the Electorate received the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück.

The Electorate became a battleground during the Seven Years&#x27; War following the French Invasion of Hanover. In the Convention of Klosterzeven it was agreed that Hanover should be neutral with large parts of the Electorate occupied by French forces. George II subsequently revoked the convention, and the re-formed Army of Observation counter-attacked and drove the French from the Electorate. Subsequent French attacks were repulsed.

In 1803, the Electorate of Hanover was occupied by France after the Convention of Artlenburg. From 1807 to 1813, the Hanoverian territory was part of the Kingdom of Westphalia. However, the government of George III did not recognize the French annexation (being at war continuously with France through the entire period) and Hanoverian ministers continued to operate from London. The Hanoverian government maintained its own separate diplomatic service, which maintained links to countries such as Austria and Prussia, with whom the United Kingdom itself was technically at war. The Hanoverian Army was dissolved, but many of the officers and soldiers went to England, where they formed the King&#x27;s German Legion. The KGL was the only German army to fight continually throughout the Napoleonic wars against the French. They played an important part in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

Although the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, George III&#x27;s government did not consider the dissolution to be final, and he continued to be styled &quot;Elector of Hanover&quot; down to 1814.

== Kingdom of Hanover 1814–1866 ==
In 1813, George III was restored to his Hanoverian territories, and in October 1814 they were erected into the independent Kingdom of Hanover at the Congress of Vienna. The Congress of Vienna instituted a territorial exchange between Hanover and Prussia, in which Hanover increased its area substantially, gaining the Bishopric of Hildesheim, East Frisia, the Lower County of Lingen and the northern part of the Bishopric of Münster. It lost the parts of the Duchy of Lauenburg to the right of the Elbe and several small exclaves in the east.

The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 on the accession of Queen Victoria because the semi-Salic succession laws in Hanover prevented a female from inheriting the throne if there was a male descendant.

In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Hanover was annexed by Prussia and became the Province of Hanover.

==Province of Hanover 1866–1946==

The Province of Hanover () was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Free State of Prussia from 1868 to 1946.

In 1946, the British military administration made the Province of Hanover the main part of the land of Lower Saxony, along with the states of Oldenburg, Brunswick, and Schaumburg-Lippe, with the city of Hanover as the capital of the new state.

<text>Grodzisk Mazowiecki () is a town in central Poland, the capital of Grodzisk Mazowiecki County in the Masovian Voivodeship, with 34,718 inhabitants (2024). It is southwest of Warsaw.

==History==

The origins of Grodzisk Mazowiecki can be traced back to the 12th century when medieval village Grodzisk was founded. This settlement was built on the outskirts of the Jaktorowska Forest and its remains are a part of the existing town area. In 1355 the first known owner of the settlement Tomasz Grodzinski founded a church which was later destroyed by fire (1441). In 15th century Grodzisk remained the parish seat. 
Dating from the end of the 15th century to 1623 Grodzisk was owned by the Okunia and Mokrowski families. In 1522 Grodzisk has received municipal rights from king Sigismund I the Old. It was administratively located in the Mszczonów County in the Rawa Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1540 Grodzisk was destroyed by the fire and was not reconstructed until the end of 16th century. After the reconstruction, Grodzisk became a local trade and production centre due to its location and the local traffic routes. In 1655 it was again destroyed during Swedish Deluge and then restored. In 1708 the town was struck by a cholera epidemic and as a result, its population diminished down to 370 people.

Grodzisk was annexed by Prussia in the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. In 1807 it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution in 1815, it fell to the Russian Partition of Poland. During the November Uprising (1830–1831) the town was the place of fights between the insurrectionists’ forces and Russian army. The recovery of the local economy was possible to the prosperous railway route connecting Warsaw and Skierniewice built in 1846. In 1870 the town&#x27;s municipal rights were taken away by the Tsarist authorities as punishment for the unsuccessful Polish January Uprising. Between the 19th and 20th century Grodzisk was known as recreation center with hydropathic establishment founded by Michał Bojasiński. In 1915 Grodzisk regained its municipal rights
In interwar Poland, Grodzisk was the seat of Błonie County in the Warsaw Voivodeship. In 1928, the town was renamed to Grodzisk Mazowiecki by the addition of the adjective &quot;Mazowiecki&quot; after the region of Masovia, within which it is located, to distinguish it from the town of Grodzisk Wielkopolski in western Poland.
Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Grodzisk Mazowiecki was occupied by Germany until 1945. Administratively it was located in the Warsaw District of the General Government. The Polish resistance was active in the town, and even the underground University of the Western Lands gave secret lectures. In 1944, the National Military Union was founded in Grodzisk Mazowiecki. Local Polish farmer Stanisława Sławińska hid Jews from the Nazis in her house in Grodzisk Mazowiecki. In 2008, she was honoured as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Among those she saved was the mother of the Israeli businessperson Yossi Maiman.

After the war, it was administratively located in the &quot;large&quot; Warsaw Voivodeship until 1975, and then the &quot;small&quot; Warsaw Voivodeship until 1998. Currently, Grodzisk Mazowiecki is a local industrial center for the area of Warsaw.

==Legends==

According to a legend regarding the town charter, monarchs were riding through the settlement of Grodzisk on their way to hunt in Jaktorowska forest. One of the monarchs, who was tired, was offered a cup of water from the town&#x27;s spring to regain his strength. It was the extraordinary taste of the water that convinced the king to grant the town a charter.

==Jewish community==
The town had a Jewish community and it had been the center of the Hasidic Grodzhisk dynasty, (Grodzisk Mazowiecki being pronounced as &quot;Grodzhisk&quot; in Yiddish.) Grodzisk was the birthplace of Kalonymus Kalman Shapira (1889–1943), also known as the Rebbe of the Warsaw Ghetto. During the wartime, all the Jewish population was deported and murdered.

In 2016, the remains of the Jewish cemetery in town were saved from being developed into a residential complex, and the city council pledged to preserve the cemetery, restore the original gate with Hebrew inscription, and build a fence around the property. Plans to build the residential complex were originally halted in 2014 when residents of the nearby Jewish community of Warsaw, as well as activist Robert Augustyniak, protested the plan.

<text>Piaseczno is a town in east-central Poland with 47,660 inhabitants. 
It is situated in the Masovian Voivodeship, within the Warsaw metropolitan area, just south of Warsaw, approximately south of its center. It is a residential area and a suburb of Warsaw. It is the capital city of Piaseczno County.

==History==

===Early history===

The origins of the city date back to a 13th-century village, located on the route between Warsaw and Czersk. Its strategic position meant that the village grew quickly. On 5 November 1429 the town obtained a charter, and soon became a local market. A further charter was confirmed in 1461.

In 1537 the town became Royal property and in the second half of the 16th century reached 1200 inhabitants based round the brewing and transport industries. Piaseczno was a royal town of Poland, administratively located in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. However, the city suffered setbacks because of numerous fires in the late 16th and early 17th centuries but returned to its former glory in the first half of the 18th century.

During the Kościuszko Uprising, on 9–10 July 1794, the Battle of Gołków was fought nearby between the Poles and the Russians, and then the town was burned by the Russians. Only a church and a few houses survived.

===Late modern era===
From 1806 to 1807 a French cavalry unit was stationed in the town as part of the Napoleonic wars, and from 1808 to 1811 this was replaced by the Polish 1st Regiment mounted rifles. The Congress of Vienna, saw the area ceded to Russia in 1815.

In 1825 the road from Warsaw and shortly afterward the railway improved links to Warsaw. As a result, Piaseczno experienced a period of economic recovery. Local Poles took part in the large January Uprising of 1863–1864. On June 15, 1864, a clash between Polish insurgents and Russian troops took place near Piaseczno.

In 1890, Countess Cecylia Plater-Zyberk bought the Chyliczki estate with the Poniatówka manor house, where she settled. The following year she established a nationally renowned school for girls, where women from low-income families could also receive an education.

In September and October 1914 Piaseczno was the site of fierce fighting between German and Russian forces in the battle for Warsaw. In May 1917, the new City Council held its first council meeting. In November 1918, German gendarmerie surrendered to local Poles and the town was restored to Poland, which just regained independence. In the interbellum Piaseczno formed part of the Polish Warsaw Voivodeship.

On June 4, 1928, Polish President Ignacy Mościcki laid the cornerstone for the folk house and in 1933 Marshal Józef Piłsudski was made an honorary citizen of the city.

===World War II===

World War II began for the city on 9 and 10 September 1939, when the Polish 54 light artillery regiment fought a skirmish with a German armored division. On September 10, 1939, German troops committed a massacre of 21 Polish prisoners of war in the town (see also &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). Afterwards, the Germans terrorized the population, and Poles over the age of 14 were subjected to forced labour. Additionally, around 400 people were captured in roundups and deported to forced labour in Germany. The Germans also committed massacres of Poles in nearby forests as part of the &quot;AB-Aktion&quot;.

In 1940, during the Nazi Occupation of Poland, German authorities established a Jewish ghetto in Piaseczno (the ), in order to confine its Jewish population for the purpose of persecution and exploitation. The ghetto was liquidated in January 1941, when all its 2,500 inhabitants were transported in cattle trucks to the Warsaw Ghetto, the largest ghetto in all of Nazi occupied Europe with over 400,000 Jews crammed into an area of . From there, most victims were sent to Treblinka extermination camp.

The Polish resistance was active, secret Polish education was organized, and the present-day district of Zalesie Dolne was the location of secret meetings of both the command of the Grey Ranks and the Education Department of the Government Delegation for Poland.

In 1944, local Poles supported the Polish Warsaw Uprising, which took place in nearby Warsaw, and some were killed by the Germans in revenge. During the uprising, the occupiers perpetrated two massacres of Poles within the present-day town limits, killing over 50 people. From August 1944, a secret Polish hospital for wounded insurgents from Warsaw operated in the town. Many Poles fled from the Germans from Warsaw to Piaseczno, and were sheltered by the local population. After the uprising, in October 1944, the German army surrounded Piaseczno and caught some 1,000 Polish refugees from Warsaw. The German occupation ended on January 17, 1945, when the Polish 1st Warsaw Armoured Brigade entered the town without a fight.
===Recent history===
In 1952, town limits were expanded by including the settlements of Orężna, Zalesie Dolne and Zalesinek as new neighbourhoods.

===Town Hall===
The original Town Hall was burned down in 1655 by the Swedes during the Deluge. The second accidentally burned down in 1730. A third Town Hall was constructed in the middle of the 18th century but was burned down during the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794. In 1815 the rebuilding was initiated and the current Town hall was built in a classical style between 1823 and 1824.

===Religious communities===

For some time the town of Piaseczno had a diverse religious community.

* In 1820 there were 893 inhabitants, of whom 171 were Jews (about 19%).
* The 1897 census showed Piaseczno had 2760 inhabitants with 41.5% Catholics, 40% Jewish and 17.9% protestant.
* In 1918 there were 6956 people in the town. Catholics were about 40%, Jews about 56% and sizable protestant and Orthodox populations also existed.

As stated above, the Jewish community was deported by the German occupiers to the Warsaw Ghetto in 1940.

Piaseczno was the seat of a Hasidic dynasty founded by Rabbi Kalonymus Kalman Shapiro, currently maintained by his extended family in Israel.

<text>Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki (pronounced , meaning ″&quot;New Masovian Court&quot;″), often simply referred to as Nowy Dwór, is a town in east-central Poland with ca. 42500 inhabitants (2008). It is situated in the Masovian Voivodeship (since 1999); previously, it was in Warszawa Voivodeship (1975–1998). It is the capital of Nowy Dwór County.

== History ==
One of its districts is Modlin, created from incorporating the former village of Modlin into the growing town in 1961. Modlin Fortress is now also part of the city. Many structures related to the fort can be seen in the Modlin district, including ruins from defensive structures designed by Napoleon Bonaparte and Tsarist Blocks built between 1899 and 1901 to house soldiers of the Russian army, and which are still in use as private flats today.

The Germans occupied the town beginning in September 1939. They immediately began to persecute the Jewish population. Many Jews fled to Warsaw, others to Soviet occupied territory in the east. From 1941 to 1942, the Germans set up a ghetto between the four streets Nałęcza, Warszawska, Mazowiecka, and Piaskowa. Most of the 9000 or more Jewish inhabitants of the town were murdered. Some were murdered in the environs of the town; most were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. Typhus was rampant in the ghetto taking many lives there. Only about 400 Nowy Dwor Jews survived; most of the survivors had fled to Soviet occupied territory and later to the Soviet Union itself, where they stayed throughout the war. Holocaust survivor Yehudis Pshenitse has recounted the efforts of a parish priest from Nowy Dwór to save her life after the murder of more than 2000 Jews in Rembertów ghetto in August 1942. Hiding her in his cellar, he gave her false papers identifying her as a Christian. Betrayed to the German occupying forces, the priest was tortured. He was released, but mortally wounded. Pshenitse described how he blessed her before dying: &quot;Once again, he asked [his housekeeper] that I be hidden in a safe place, and then he died.&quot; The housekeeper took her to Modlin, where she was able to survive, living &quot;by her own wits, posing as a Christian child.&quot;

The Israeli city of Holon has a Nowy Dwór Street (רחוב נובידבור). The name was given at the request of survivors of the Nowy Dwór Jewish community, who arrived in Holon after 1945.

Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki is also renowned for its wooden architecture, which is still faintly visible within the city limits. Some of the wooden houses and villas date back to the late 18th century. The name &quot;Nowy Dwór&quot; itself, which literally means &quot;New Manor&quot; in English, relates to the manor-like architecture of the region.

<text>Wołomin is a town in the Warsaw metropolitan area in the Masovian Voivodship, seat of Wołomin County. Wołomin is situated approximately east of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, near the railway to Białystok. It has approximately 43,000 inhabitants and covers an area of .

In the 1990s and 2000s, the town was synonymous with the &quot;Wołomin gang&quot;, one of two major organised crime groups in the country.

==History==

Wołomin was first mentioned in chronicles from the 15th century. It remained a small village in central Masovia without much significance. Since the 19th century, and especially after the foundation of the railway in 1862, Wołomin became a summer holiday destination for Warsaw citizens. The Wołomin glassworks were founded in the beginning of the 20th century.

Wołomin was declared a town in 1919 after the return of Poland&#x27;s sovereignty. In 1920 the Polish counter-attack in the Battle of Warsaw was conducted near Wołomin. In the interbellum, Wołomin retained its status as a multinational town. There was a big Jewish and Russian minority. Polish writer Zofia Nałkowska had a house in Wołomin, which became an inspiration for her 1925 book &quot;House over meadows&quot; ().

===World War II===
At the beginning of World War II, Wołomin was bombed by the German Air Force. In Wołomin there were no big fights on land, but there were regular air fights between German and Polish planes from the airport in Zielonka. 157 soldiers from Wołomin participated in the war against the Germans. A large proportion were killed, the rest of them were taken prisoner. German forces occupied Wołomin on September 14, 1939. A number of activists of pre-war Polish social organizations were sent to concentration camps by Germans.
A resistance movement was created in Wołomin based on scouts and national organizations. Eventually, the Wołomin conspiracy was subordinated to the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne organization.

During World War II, the Jews of Wołomin were forced into a ghetto set up by Nazi German administration on 15 November 1940, along the railway line between the streets of Kobyłka, Wspólna, Wiejska, Glinka and Cementowa. The ghetto inmates numbered about 2,700 people including Jews expelled from other locations. The &quot;Judenrat&quot; was established in the building at 17 Nałkowskiego Street. Deportations aboard Holocaust trains to Treblinka extermination camp began on 19 August 1942. The ghetto was liquidated on 6 October 1942. A few hundred people (416-620 according to different sources) were shot in the ghetto, including many elderly and sick people. Their bodies were buried in a mass grave near the J. Korsaka Road. Some Jews were deported to the Warsaw Ghetto as slave labour and exterminated during the &quot;Grossaktion Warsaw&quot;.

In 1944 a substantial battle was fought near the town between the Soviet armoured units and German 39th Panzer Corps. Soviet losses were high and the Red Army was forced to retreat. Most of the Russian minority escaped westwards before the arrival of the Red Army.

===Postwar history===
After the war, Wołomin became a capital of the powiat of Wołomin and started to grow rapidly. The window assembly plant was founded and Wołomin soon became a suburb of Warsaw. Even today most of the town&#x27;s inhabitants commute to Warsaw on a daily basis.

After 1989 Wołomin&#x27;s glassworks were temporarily closed during the recession. However, the technology of production of temperature resistant glass, invented in the facility, allowed the factory to continue production and recover under new ownership.

== Sports ==
BS Wołomin is a professional women&#x27;s basketball team, they play in the Basket League.

== Crime ==
The most well known of the Polish organised crime groups in the 1990s was the so-called &quot;Wołomin gang&quot; and their arch-nemesis&#x27; the &quot;Pruszków gang&quot;, with whom they fought bloody turf wars. Eventually the groups were finally crushed by the Polish police in cooperation with the German police in a spectacular raid on the A2 motorway between Konin and Poznań in September 2011.

<doc id="386944" wikidata="Q745059" url="?curid=386944" title="Otwock">
<text>Otwock (Yiddish: אָטוואָצק) is a city in the Masovian Voivodeship in east-central Poland, some south-east of Warsaw, with 44,635 inhabitants (2019). Otwock is part of the Warsaw metropolitan area. It is situated on the right bank of the Vistula River, below the mouth of the Świder River. Otwock is home to a unique architectural style called &quot;Świdermajer&quot;.

It is the capital of Otwock County. The town covers an area of . Forested areas make up 23% of the territory, and there are several nature reserves.

==History==
Even though the first mention of a village called &quot;Otwosko&quot; comes from the early 15th century, Otwock did not fully develop until the second half of the 19th century, when in 1877 the Vistula River Railroad was opened, which ran from Mława via Warsaw, to Lublin and Chełm. Otwock, which is located along the line, became a popular suburb, with numerous spas and several notable guests, including Józef Piłsudski and Władysław Reymont, who wrote his Nobel Prize-winning novel &quot;Chłopi&quot; there. The Zofiówka Sanatorium was opened in Otwock in 1908. In 1916, Otwock was incorporated as a town and became the seat of a powiat.

During the Battle of Warsaw (1920), Otwock, along with nearby Karczew, constituted the edge of the right wing of the first line of Polish defense and was manned by the Polish 15th Infantry Division, whereas the second line of Polish defense began in the present-day neighborhood of Świdry Wielkie; however, there was no Polish-Russian fighting in Otwock.

In 1936 the Warsaw - Otwock railway connection was the first rail line to be electrified in Poland.

===World War II===

Following the German–Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the town was occupied by Germany. In December 1939, the German authorities established a Jewish ghetto in Otwock. A murderous Action T4 euthanasia program was carried out by the Nazis in the local Zofiówka Sanatorium for the psychiatric patients in order to confine its Jewish population for the purpose of persecution and exploitation. The Ghetto was liquidated between August and 19 September 1942, when 75% of its Jewish population of 12,000–15,000 numbering at around 8,000 were assembled by the Nazis at a layover yard in Otwock &quot;(pictured)&quot; and transported in cattle trucks to extermination camps in Treblinka and Auschwitz. Jews who remained were summarily shot at Reymonta Street soon after. 
Otwock is the hometown of Irena Sendler (1910 – 2008), the Polish humanitarian who saved thousands of Jewish children during the Holocaust; as well as Krystyna Dańko, both awarded the titles of Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Writer Calel Perechodnik, a Jewish Ghetto Policeman from Otwock also hailed from this town. Following the liberation, a children&#x27;s home for Holocaust survivors was established in Otwock.

===Post-war period===
In 1952, the town&#x27;s limits were expanded by including Świder, Świdry Wielkie, Teklin and Zamlądz as new neighbourhoods. Following the Korean War, in 1953–1959, Poland admitted 200 North Korean orphans in Świder.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Warsaw Voivodeship.

==Sights==
In Otwock there are many buildings in the &quot;Świdermajer&quot; style, unique to the town and its surroundings. There are also memorials to Józef Piłsudski and to local Jews, who were murdered by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust.

The Mszar Pogorzelski, Świder and Wyspy Świderskie nature reserves are located in Otwock.

==Economy==
In 1958, Ewa, the first Polish nuclear reactor was activated in Swierk district of Otwock. A second research reactor, Maria, was erected in 1974.

==Sports==
Otwock is home to the sports club Start Otwock (founded in 1924). The club is renowned for its weight-lifters such as Szymon Kołecki and Marcin Dołęga.The club&#x27;s own prodigy is football forward Janusz Żmijewski, who in the 1960s played for Legia Warszawa and the national team of Poland.

The name comes from Jabłonna, the nearby village, where in 1774-1779 Bishop Michał Poniatowski (brother of Poland&#x27;s last king, Stanisław Poniatowski) built his palace Jabłonna Palace () - now owned by the Polish Academy of Sciences.
* In 1892, the Russian army barracks were built near the railroad station () and a local garrison of the Russian army was stationed there, as a part of Warsaw Stronghold Region (), until the beginning of World War I, when this region was occupied by the German troops.
* In 1912, Legionowo is given a city rights.
* In 1919, Jabłonna Nowa was renamed as Legionowo to honour Polish Legions.
* Ca. 1920 Institute of Aerology (currently Aerology Centre within Institute of Meteorology and Water Administration, ) was opened.
* During the Battle for Warsaw () in August 1920, from barracks in Legionowo, General Żeligowski led the 10th Infantry Division () to Radzymin, which helped to save Warsaw from the Red Army.
* In 1922, the Aviotex balloon and parachute factory, which also produced tents and other camping equipment (e.g. sleeping bags), opened in Legionowo.
* After 1925, Legionowo became a summer resort for inhabitants of Warsaw, as by that time, it was a wooded and unpolluted area.
* Between World War I and World War II, narrow-gauge railroad line connected Legionowo with Warsaw, going through Jabłonna.
* In 1930, Legionowo became a commune ().
* During World War II, a ward of the Stalag 368 prisoner-of-war camp in Beniaminów and a ghetto were located in Legionowo.
* During World War II, in 1944, Legionowo took part in Warsaw uprising, as so-called District 7: Collar (). During the first week of August 1944, Legionowo was a place of regular fights between German troops and Polish rebels. After a week or so, Germans put down the uprising and several Poles were executed in one of the military shelters near the railroad line.
* After World War II, there was a brick factory, now non-existent.
* In the 1950s, the standard-gauge railroad line was electrified.
* In the late 1960s, a narrow-gauge railroad line was closed and in the early 1970s, the tracks were removed. The terminus and depot buildings remain, currently in private use.
* In the 1960s, the first 4-storey blocks of flats were built. In the 1970s and 1980s, three large groups of flats (4-storey and 11-storey) were built.

<text>Pruszków ( &quot;Prushkov&quot;) is a city in east-central Poland, capital of Pruszków County in the Masovian Voivodeship. Pruszków is located along the western edge of the Warsaw metropolitan area.

In the 1990s and 2000s the city was synonymous with the &quot;Pruszków gang&quot;, one of two major organised crime groups in the country. Currently it is best known for being the country&#x27;s cycling centre with a purpose built indoor velodrome.

== History ==

Pruszków was incorporated as a town in 1916 during World War I, although the village was first mentioned in chronicles in the 15th century. Within the Kingdom of Poland, it was a private village of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province. The development of the town was aided by the construction of the Warsaw-Vienna Railway in the 19th century and the construction of the Elektryczna Kolej Dojazdowa (now Warszawska Kolej Dojazdowa), Poland&#x27;s first electrified commuter train line, in 1927. In the late 19th century, industry developed intensively in Pruszków. There were needles, porcelain, faience, and soap factories in Pruszków. A large psychiatric hospital opened in the outlying village of Tworki in 1891 and is still operating to this day. During World War I, a battle between German and Russian forces took place in Pruszków on 12–18 October 1914 (part of Battle of the Vistula River). Despite the initial success of the German forces on 12 October, they were push-backed out of town after successful Russian counter-attack on 14th. An intense artillery fire by both sides caused severe damages to many buildings in Pruszków including train station, power plant, and two churches. In August 1915 Pruszków was taken by the German forces without a fight. Within interwar Poland, it was administratively located in the Warsaw County in the Warsaw Voivodeship.

===World War II===

The city was occupied by Germany following the German–Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939. On 14 December 1939, the Germans murdered 46 Poles from Pruszków during the large Palmiry massacre. Before the invasion, the city had a large Jewish population. In 1940, the German occupation authorities established a Jewish ghetto in Pruszków, in order to confine its Jewish population for the purpose of persecution and exploitation. The ghetto was liquidated on 31 January 1941, when all its 1,400–3,000 inhabitants were transported in cattle trucks to Warsaw Ghetto, the largest ghetto in all of Nazi occupied Europe with over 400,000 Jews crammed into an area of . From there, most victims were sent to Treblinka extermination camp.
During the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, the Nazis created the large &quot;Durchgangslager 121&quot; (&quot;Dulag 121&quot;) transit camp in Pruszków on the site of the Train Repair Shops (Zakłady Naprawcze Taboru Kolejowego) to intern the evacuees expelled from the capital. Around 550,000 Warsaw residents and approximately 100,000 more from its outskirts were incarcerated in the camp. The SS and Gestapo segregated the Poles, who were then either deported to forced labour in Germany, sent to Nazi concentration camps, or expelled to more southern locations of German-occupied Poland. Approximately 650,000 Poles passed through the Pruszków camp in August, September and October 1944. Approximately 55,000 were sent to concentration camps, including 13,500 to Auschwitz, 12,000 to Ravensbrück and 8,700 to Mauthausen. They included people from a variety of social classes and occupations (government officials, scholars, artists, physicians, merchants, and blue-collar workers), in varying physical conditions (the injured, the sick, invalids, and pregnant women), and of various ages from infants only a few weeks old to the elderly, aged 86 or more. In a few cases, these were also people of different ethnic backgrounds including Jews living on &quot;Aryan papers.&quot; The Germans murdered several Polish Catholic monks and nuns in the camp.

Following the Soviet westward offensive, on 26 March 1945, the 16 members of the Polish Underground Government were invited by the Russians for talks, to a house in Pruszków on Armii Krajowej Street. They were captured by the Soviet NKVD agents, transported to USSR, imprisoned, tortured and sentenced in Moscow during the so-called Trial of the Sixteen.

===Post-war Poland===

After World War II, Pruszków became one of Masovia&#x27;s largest industrial centers. It was previously in Warszawa Voivodeship (1975–1998). Due to its proximity to Warsaw, it is now home to several factories and companies, including Herbapol, Daewoo Electronics, L&#x27;Oréal Cosmetics as well as logistic centers. It is also an important sports center, with a sports gymnasium, soccer stadium and a cycling course.

==Crime==
The most well known of the Polish organised crime groups in the 1990s was the so-called &quot;Pruszków gang&quot; and their arch-nemesis&#x27; the &quot;Wołomin gang&quot;, with whom they fought bloody turf wars. Eventually the groups were finally crushed by the Polish police in cooperation with the German police in a spectacular raid on the A2 motorway between Konin and Poznań in September 2011.

==Population==

== Sports ==
The city&#x27;s local football team is Znicz Pruszków. It plays in the second division since 2023 where they previously competed between 2007-2010 and 2016-2017. Robert Lewandowski played for Znicz from 2006 to 2008, whereas Pruszków-born Jacek Gmoch and Radosław Majewski also played in Znicz: Gmoch from 1953 to 1958, Majewski from 2002 to 2006.

The city has two professional basketball teams: women&#x27;s and the basketball section of the football club, men&#x27;s Znicz Basket Pruszków.

<doc id="386953" wikidata="Q161962" url="?curid=386953" title="Chełmno">
<text>Chełmno (; older ; , formerly also ) is a town in northern Poland near the Vistula river with 18,915 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is the seat of the Chełmno County in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship.

Due to its regional importance in the Middle Ages, the town gave its name to the entire area, Chełmno Land (and later an administrative unit of the Kingdom of Poland, the Chełmno Voivodeship), the local Catholic diocese and Kulm law, a municipal form of government for over 180 cities and towns in Central Europe, most notably Warsaw, Gdańsk, Toruń, Königsberg, Olsztyn, Płock and Klaipėda. It possesses a well-preserved historic Old Town, listed as a Historic Monument of Poland, with landmark Gothic churches and a Renaissance town hall. It was an important education center in the early modern period, and the place of pioneering surgical operations by renown Polish 19th-century surgeon Ludwik Rydygier.

== Name ==
The city&#x27;s name &quot;Chełmno&quot; comes from &quot;chelm&quot;, the old Polish word for hill. After the area was granted to the Teutonic Knights as a Polish fief in 1232, the Germanized name &quot;Culm/Kulm&quot; was used in official documents regarding the town, as the city was a member of the Hanseatic League and part of the State of the Teutonic Order. Chełmno was annexed by Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772 and, as part of a larger Germanization effort, it was officially renamed &quot;Kulm&quot;. During the German occupation in World War II, the town was again renamed from Chełmno to &quot;Kulm&quot;.

== History ==

The first written mention of Chełmno is known from a document allegedly issued in 1065 by Duke Bolesław II the Generous of Poland for the Benedictine monastery in Mogilno. In 1226 Duke Konrad I of Masovia invited the Teutonic Knights to Chełmno Land. In 1233 Kulm was granted city rights known as &quot;Kulm law&quot; (renewed in 1251), the model system for over 200 currently Polish, Lithuanian and Russian towns. The town was made the nominal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chełmno under the archbishop of Riga by the papal legate William of Modena in 1243 (however, the cathedral and the residence of the bishop were located actually in the adjacent Chełmża). The town grew prosperous as a member of the mercantile Hanseatic League.

In the 14th century, papal verdicts ordered the restoration of the town and region to Poland, however, the Teutonic Knights did not comply and continued to occupy it. The town remained part of the Teutonic Knights&#x27; state until 1454. In 1440, the town was one of the founding members of the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and upon the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. In May 1454 the town pledged allegiance to the Polish King in Toruń. After the end of the Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the Teutonic Knights renounced claims to the town, and recognized it as part of Poland. It was made the capital of Chełmno Voivodeship. After dissolution of the Archdiocese of Riga in 1566, the bishops of Chełmno attended the councils of the ecclesiastical province of the metropolitan of Gniezno. This practice was recognised by the Holy See by the Bull &quot;De salute animarum&quot; in 1821, when Chełmno diocese became de jure a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Gniezno. Chełmno diocese was enlarged on that occasion (Górzno, Krajna and Działdowo). In 1692, the local gymnasium was transformed into the Chełmno Academy (&quot;Akademia Chełmińska&quot;), which in 1756 became a branch of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, the oldest and leading Polish university. Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki, one of the greatest Polish Baroque composers, was a lecturer at the Academy in the 1690s.

In 1772, following the First Partition of Poland, the town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1807 and 1815 Chełmno was part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, being re-annexed by Prussia at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.

As &quot;Kulm&quot;, it had been a garrison town. In 1776 Frederick the Great founded here a cadet school which was to serve in Germanising Polish areas and nobility. In 1890 the garrison included 561 military staff. On 1 October 1890 the cadet school was moved to Koszalin (then &quot;Köslin&quot;) in Pomerania. Also as part of anti-Polish policies, the Prussians expelled the Kraków professors from Chełmno, abolished the local Polish academy, and closed down Catholic monasteries. Poles were subjected to various repressions, local Polish newspapers were confiscated.
Renown Polish surgeon Ludwik Rydygier opened his private clinic in the town in 1878, where he conducted pioneering surgical operations, including the first in Poland and second in the world surgical removal of the pylorus in a patient suffering from stomach cancer in 1880 and the first in the world peptic ulcer resection in 1881. Rydygier sold the clinic to one of his employees, Leon Polewski, in 1887, due to harassment from the Prussian authorities.

On 22 January 1920 Polish troops were greeted by a large crowd of residents and Chełmno was reintegrated with Poland, which regained independence after World War I.
When World War II broke out in 1939, Nazi German authorities murdered 5,000 Polish civilians upon taking control of the territory. The atrocities took place in Klamry, Małe Czyste, Podwiesk, Płutowo, Dąbrowa Chełmińska, and Wielkie Łunawy, while many other Poles were executed in forests. A number of Chelmno citizens are interviewed about these events in the documentary film &quot;Shoah&quot; (1985). The rest of the Polish population was expelled to the General Government in the more eastern part of German-occupied Poland in line with the German policy of Lebensraum. Polish Secret State resistance groups such as Polska Żyje (&quot;Poland Lives&quot;), Rota, Grunwald, and Szare Szeregi were also active in the area. The area was administered as part of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and served as the seat of the district/county (&quot;kreis&quot;) of Kulm. On 25 January 1945 German forces set fire to several buildings in the city, including a hospital, a railway terminal, and a brewery, while retreating (see scorched earth).
The town was administratively part of the Toruń Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998.

==Demographics==
Since its founding, the city had a mixed population of Poles and Germans, with the former making up ⅔ of its population in the second half of the 19th century.

<doc id="386956" wikidata="Q4859960" url="?curid=386956" title="Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands">
<text>Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands is a municipality with town status in Manitoulin District in Northeastern Ontario, Canada, approximately south of Espanola. Its main town is Little Current, located on the northeast side of Manitoulin Island. However, its territory also includes most of the small islands surrounding Manitoulin, even those at the far western end of Manitoulin.

The town was created on January 1, 1998, by amalgamating the Town of Little Current with the Township of Howland and the unorganized small islands in Lake Huron.

It is the administrative headquarters of the Aundeck Omni Kaning First Nations band government.

==Geography==
===Communities===

Little Current is the largest community within the town, as well as its administrative centre. Formerly an independent town, Little Current was named variously by different groups for the swift strong currents of water running between the narrow passageway which connects the North Channel and Georgian Bay. Past names for the community included Wewebijiwang/Wyabegwong, Le Petit Courant, and Shaftesbury.

The town also includes the smaller communities of Cold Springs, Dinner Point Depot, Eads Bush, Green Bay, Honora, Rockville, and Sheguiandah.

===Climate===
The climate is characterized by warm, humid summers (sometimes rainy/cooler) and snowy, rigorous winters. The cold season does not have many differences with other North American places of the same parallel. However, the obvious differing factor is that all weather is dictated by Lake Huron. As such, the lake generates microclimates similar to coastal cities, thousands of miles away; one example is Asahikawa, on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Northeastern Manitoulin and the Islands had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Economy==

In the late 19th century lake vessels stopped here to take on wood for fuel. A settlement developed, with George Abotossaway, an Anishinaabe man, selling fuel to the steamers. The westbound passengers on board the vessels were usually from Upper Canada. One group included the Turner family which disembarked and, being merchants, set up a general store still in business today.

The lumbering trade was foremost in the region at the time and saw mills were established at nearby Low Island, now a park in the community. Settlers cleared the land for farming.

Today the local economy continues to include farming and lumbering but tourism is a main aspect.

==Culture==
Each year the town hosts &quot;Haweater Weekend,&quot; a weeklong celebration which takes its name from the Haweaters, the name given to one who is born on Manitoulin Island. The main celebrations take place on the first weekend of August, and include a fireworks display, a video dance, street vendors, and a parade.

The prominent American sportsman John W. Galbreath (1897-1988), owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball club as well as the Darby Dan Farm thoroughbred horse racing operation, owned a summer retreat here and named one of his horses after the village. Little Current won the 1974 Preakness and Belmont Stakes and was voted that year&#x27;s United States Champion 3-Yr-Old Colt.

==Transportation==

Being a safe haven from the ravages of Lake Huron, the community may be found on Canadian Hydrographic Chart #2205. It is well marked from the east by Strawberry Island Lighthouse and from the west by a series of navigational markers.

The only land access to Manitoulin is the Little Current Swing Bridge, located on Highway 6, crossing the North Channel of Lake Huron to the mainland, where the highway continues northward to Espanola. In summer the swing bridge opens to marine traffic on the hour for 15 minutes from sunrise to sunset, delaying road traffic.

Historically, Little Current was the western terminus of the Algoma Eastern Railway before the AER&#x27;s acquisition by the Canadian Pacific Railway. After acquisition, the portion from McKerrow to Little Current was designated as the Little Current subdivision of the CPR, and became a spur of its Sault Ste. Marie line. Passenger rail ridership through Espanola and Little Current continued for some time due to the relatively difficult road access to the island, but passenger operations along the spur ended in 1963, and the line became an infrequently-used &quot;ghost railway&quot;. Over the following decades, the CPR gradually removed sections of the track: in the 1980s, the section connecting Goat Island to Manitoulin Island across the Little Current Swing Bridge (which was converted to service road traffic only), and in the 1990s, the section connecting Espanola to Goat Island. Currently only a small portion of the track still exists, which connects the Domtar pulp and paper mill in Espanola to the CPR line using the junction at McKerrow; this stretch of track is the only surviving remnant of the AER.

In April 2018, Ontario Northland announced that it would begin bus service on Manitoulin Island, with buses stopping at Little Current upon arrival from Sudbury before travelling around the island using a circular route. The new route also includes Sheguiandah. This new route marked the first time the island had seen bus service in decades. Manitoulin Island service ended in 2019.

== Media ==

=== Radio ===

The town has two radio stations, CFRM and CHAW. Some radio stations from Sudbury can also be heard in the area, as can Elliot Lake&#x27;s CKNR.

=== Newspaper ===
The town&#x27;s primary community newspaper is the weekly &quot;Manitoulin Expositor&quot;, which is the oldest still-extant newspaper in Northern Ontario.

<text>Brodnica () is a town in northern Poland with 28,574 inhabitants . It is the seat of Brodnica County in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. The nearby Brodnica Landscape Park, a protected area, gets its name from Brodnica.

Brodnica is the capital of the district whose present quarter Michałowo, a settlement mentioned as early as in 1138 and then in 1240 as castrum Michałowo, hides relics from Neolithic era. As it is confirmed in old documents Michałowo was the capital of the Masovian Castellany. The town was chosen owing to its good position on the Drwęca (on the trade route leading from Masovia to Prussia) and a customs house between Dobrzyń and Chełmno Land (mentioned in 1252).

==History==

The first reference to the town of Brodnica dates from 1263. In 1285–1370 the construction of the Gothic Church of St. Catherine took place. Brodnica received town privileges in 1298. In 1414, a Polish–Teutonic truce was signed there, ending the Hunger War. In 1440, the town was one of the founding members of the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and upon the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. In May 1454 the town pledged allegiance to the Polish King in Toruń. After the end of the Thirteen Years&#x27; War, the Teutonic Knights renounced claims to the town, and recognized it as part of Poland. It became a royal town of the Polish Crown, administratively located in the Chełmno Voivodeship. In the Teutonic state Brodnica was the seat of the Commander, in the Polish Kingdom it was the capital of the district starosty, and the former Commander&#x27;s lands were then royal property.

A favourable location on the intersection of important routes used for transportation of different goods (wood, fish, furs, animal skin, grain, wool) accelerated the development of the town, making it an important trading centre, the status still reflected in the number of well-preserved granaries along the Drwęca. Between 1486 and 1604 the town belonged to the Działyński family, then between 1604 and 1625 to Anna Vasa of Sweden who was the royal sister of Sigismund III Vasa, King of Poland, Lithuania, and Sweden. In later years it was the property Queen Cecily Renata, Chancellor Jerzy Ossoliński, Queen Maria Casimira, and Marshal Franciszek Bieliński.

Brodnica was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772, during the First Partition of Poland, but in 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, Brodnica became part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815, Brodnica, known as &quot;Strasburg&quot; in German, was again annexed by Prussia. In 1871, it also became part of the German Empire. After 1785, the Prussians dismantled the Brodnica Castle, preserving only the tower, which is currently the highest Gothic tower in Poland east of the Vistula, and serves as a museum and a watchtower. The town had a Protestant church, a Catholic church, a synagogue, a grammar school, a district court, a main customs office and several commercial operations.

The 19th century saw 20 thousand Polish soldiers interned after the failure of the November Uprising (1830–1831) and many townspeople and noblemen involved in the January Uprising (1863). It is in the Brodnica region too that Masovian insurgents sought refuge from Russian persecution after the failure of the January Uprising. Bank Spółdzielczy w Brodnicy, which is the oldest continuously operating Polish bank, was established in 1862. In 1873 a Polish philomath organization was founded in the local gymnasium, whose activity ended in 1901 due to Germany&#x27;s anti-Polish policies.

Between 1886 and 1910, Brodnica received railway connections with Działdowo, Grudziądz, Iława, Sierpc and Jabłonowo Pomorskie, which made it an important railway junction and triggered industrial progress. In the 19th century, the Chełmno Land (and Brodnica in particular) was a refuge for Polish patriots who contributed greatly to social, cultural and economic life of the region, like Ignacy Łyskowski.
In January 1920, after the end of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, Brodnica was reintegrated with Poland, which had recently regained independence. On 18 August 1920, the town was the site of a Polish victory over the invading Soviets in the during the Polish–Soviet War. In the 1920s the town was visited by highest Polish dignitaries: Prime Minister Wincenty Witos, Marshal Józef Piłsudski and President Stanisław Wojciechowski.

During the occupation of Poland (World War II), in 1939, Germans carried out mass arrests of local Poles, who were later murdered in the area or deported to Nazi concentration camps. Some of these Poles were murdered in Skrwilno between 15 October and 15 November 1939 and in Brzezinki in October 1939. The interwar principal of the local high school, Klemens Malicki, was among the Polish principals and teachers murdered in the Oranienburg concentration camp as part of the &quot;Intelligenzaktion Pommern&quot;. In 1940–1941, the Germans carried out expulsions of Poles, whose homes, shops and workshops were then handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. An Einsatzgruppen penal camp was operated in the town during the occupation, and in 1944, the Germans also established a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp, intended for female prisoners. The German occupation ended in January 1945.

In 1975–1998, it was administratively located in the Toruń Voivodeship.

==Climate==
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot;. (Marine West Coast Climate).
== Location ==
Brodnica is located in the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship on an important route transit over the small river Drwęca, about south-east of Grudziądz, south-west of Olsztyn and south of Elbląg.

== Points of interest ==
During World War I, Brodnica became the site of a German war cemetery. During the Polish–Soviet War, 31 Polish soldiers killed during the Battle of Brodnica on 18 August 1920 were laid to rest here. In 1943, German soldiers who died in the local hospital together with those who lost their lives on 21 January 1945 during the Soviet offensive were put in the ground. A curiosity is that the Red Army soldiers who died on the same day were buried here as well. It is also a burial place for agents of the Ministry of Public Security who fought Polish anti-communist partisans during the Polish People&#x27;s Republic.

==Sport==
The sports teams in the city include the football club Sparta Brodnica, the handball MKS Brodnica club, the Karate Shotokan Brodnica club, the Aikido &quot;Brodnicka Akademia Aikido&quot; club, the boxing &quot;Klub Bokserski Gladiator Brodnica&quot;, and the MMA Fight Team MMA Brodnica.

==Culture==

The Museum of Brodnica (&quot;Muzeum w Brodnicy&quot;) consists of three branches, focusing on history, archeology and contemporary art. It is located in the Renaissance granary, the Brodnica Castle tower and the Gothic Chełmińska Gate.

<doc id="386959" wikidata="Q723431" url="?curid=386959" title="Uraga Channel">
<text>The is a waterway connecting Tokyo Bay to the Sagami Gulf. It is an important channel for ships headed from Tokyo, Yokohama, and Chiba to the Pacific Ocean and beyond.

==Geography==

The Uraga channel is at the southern end of Tokyo Bay (formerly known as Edo Bay, prior to 1868).

Tokyo Bay is surrounded by the Bōsō Peninsula (Chiba Prefecture) to the east and the Miura Peninsula (Kanagawa Prefecture) to the west. In a narrow sense, Tokyo Bay is the area north of the straight line formed by the on the Miura Peninsula on one end and on the Boso Peninsula on the other end. This area covers about 922 km². Tokyo Bay, in a broader sense, would be understood to include the Uraga Channel as well (its southwestern demarcation being the straight line between the Tsurugisaki Lighthouse and Sunosaki Lighthouse); and the total area of the bay would then be 1320 km².

The city of Uraga is located at the northern end of the channel on the Miura Peninsula. Due to its strategic location at the entrance of Edo Bay, Uraga has often been the first point of contact between visiting foreign ships and Japan.

At its narrowest, between Cape Kannon and Futtsu Point, the channel is 6 km wide. During the late Edo period, it was defended against foreign ships by twelve artillery batteries on both the Bōsō Peninsula and Miura Peninsula.

==History==

In 1846, Captain James Biddle of the U.S. Navy anchored two warships, the USS &quot;Columbus&quot; and the USS &quot;Vincennes&quot; in Uraga Channel at the mouth to Tokyo Bay. This was a step in what turned out to be an unsuccessful effort to open Japan to trade with the United States.

On July 14, 1853, Commodore Matthew Perry lowered the anchor of the squadron the Japanese called the Black Ships near Uraga at Kurihama (in present-day Yokosuka in Kanagawa Prefecture) at the mouth of the channel. On the return of the Commodore&#x27;s squadron in 1854, the ships by-passed Uraga to anchor closer to Edo at Kanagawa, which is where the city of Yokohama now stands.

<doc id="386964" wikidata="Q371602" url="?curid=386964" title="Cynthia Ann Parker">
<text>Cynthia Ann Parker, Naduah, Narua, or Preloch (, , ; October 28, 1827 – March 1871), was a woman who was captured, aged around nine, by a Comanche band during the Fort Parker massacre in 1836, where several of her relatives were killed. She was taken with several of her family members, including her younger brother John Richard Parker. Parker was later adopted into the tribe and had three children with a chief. Twenty-four years later she was relocated and taken captive by Texas Rangers, aged approximately 33, and unwillingly forced to separate from her sons and conform to European-American society. Her Comanche name means &quot;was found&quot; or &quot;someone found.&quot;

Thoroughly assimilated as Comanche, Parker had married Peta Nocona, a chief. They had three children together, including son Quanah Parker, who became the last free Comanche chief.

Parker was captured by the Texas Rangers during the Battle of Pease River, also known as the &quot;Pease River Massacre&quot;. During this raid, the Rangers killed an estimated six to twelve people, mostly women and children. Afterwards, Parker was taken back to her extended biological family against her will. For the remaining 10 years of her life, she mourned for her Comanche family, and refused to adjust to white society. She escaped at least once but was recaptured and brought back. Unable to grasp how thoroughly she identified with the Comanche, the European-American settlers believed that she had been saved or redeemed by being returned to their society.

Heartbroken over her daughter&#x27;s death from influenza and pneumonia, Parker died within seven years in 1871. Although initially buried in Anderson County, Texas, her remains were moved twice after her death. In 1910 her son Quanah had her moved to Post Oak Mission Cemetery, Comanche County, Oklahoma; and in 1957 the mother and son were both reinterred in Fort Sill Cemetery in Oklahoma. In 1965 the state of Texas arranged for her daughter&#x27;s remains to be moved from Texas and reinterred next to the mother and son.

== Early life ==
Cynthia Ann Parker was born to Silas Mercer Parker and Lucinda Parker (née Duty) in Crawford County, Illinois. Her birth date is uncertain; according to the 1870 census of Anderson County, Texas, she was born in 1824 or 1825. When she was nine or 10 years old, her grandfather, John Parker, was recruited to settle his family in north-central Texas; he was to establish a settlement fortified against Comanche raids, which had been devastating to the Euro-American colonization of Texas and northern Mexico. The Parker family, its extended kin, and surrounding families established fortified blockhouses and a central citadel—later named Fort Parker—on the headwaters of the Navasota River in what is now Limestone County.

== Fort Parker massacre ==

John Parker, the patriarch of the family, had been a noted ranger, scout, Native American fighter, and soldier for the United States. Historians conjecture that when he negotiated treaties with the local non-Comanche natives, he believed those treaties would bind all Native Americans. If so, his experience did not give him an understanding of the highly decentralized nature of Indian bands.

On May 19, 1836, a force of from 100 to 600 Native American warriors, composed of Comanche and Kiowa and Kichai allies, attacked the community. John Parker and his men did not comprehend the military prowess of the Comanche, and were unprepared for the ferocity and speed of the Indian warriors. They fought a rearguard action to protect some of the escaping women and children, but soon the settlers retreated into the fort. The Native Americans attacked the fort and quickly overpowered the outnumbered defenders. The Comanche took Cynthia Ann Parker, a young girl, and five other captives with them back to Comanche territory and killed many others. The Texans quickly mounted a rescue force. During the Texans&#x27; pursuit of the Native Americans, a teenage girl escaped. Over a period of years, the Comanche released other captives as their families paid ransoms but Parker was adopted by a Comanche family and became thoroughly assimilated. She is estimated to have been aged 9 or so when taken.

Parker became assimilated into the tribe. She was adopted by a Tenowish Comanche couple, who raised her as their own daughter. She became Comanche in every sense. She married Peta Nocona, a chief. They enjoyed a happy marriage. As a tribute to his great affection for her, he never took another wife, even though it was traditional for chieftains to have several wives. They had three children: sons Quanah, who became the last free Comanche chief, and Pecos (Pecan), and a daughter Topsannah (Prairie Flower).

== Return to Texas ==

In December 1860, after years of searching at the behest of Parker&#x27;s father and various scouts, a band of Texas Rangers led by Lawrence Sullivan Ross discovered a band of Comanche, deep in the heart of Comancheria, that was rumored to hold American captives. In a surprise raid, the Rangers attacked a group of Comanche in the Battle of Pease River.

After limited fighting, the Comanche attempted to flee. Ranger Ross and several of his men pursued the man who had appeared as the leader, and who was fleeing alongside a woman rider. As Ross and his men neared, she held a child over her head. The men did not shoot, but instead surrounded and stopped her. Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually shooting him three times. Although he fell off his horse, he was still alive and refused to surrender. Ross&#x27;s cook, Antonio Martinez, identified the man as Nocona and killed him.

The Rangers began questioning the woman and other surviving Comanche. In broken English, she identified herself and her family name. Her information matched what Ross knew of captives taken in the 1836 Fort Parker Massacre.
Ross sent Parker and her daughter to Camp Cooper, and notified her uncle, Colonel Isaac Parker that she had been returned. He took her to his home near Birdville.

Parker&#x27;s return to her birth family captured the country&#x27;s imagination. In 1861, the Texas legislature granted her a square league of land (about 4,400 acres or ) and an annual pension of $100 (~$ in ) for the next five years. They appointed her cousins, Isaac Duke Parker and Benjamin F. Parker, as her legal guardians.

However, Parker never adjusted to her new surroundings. Although white and physically part of the community, she was uncomfortable with the attention she received. Her brother, Silas Jr., was appointed her guardian in 1862, and took her to his home in Van Zandt County. When he entered the Confederate Army, she went to live with her sister, Orlena Parker O&#x27;Quinn. Some said that she missed her sons and worried about them.

== Death ==

In 1864, Parker&#x27;s daughter, Topʉsana, caught influenza and died of pneumonia. Parker was stricken with grief, added to her missing her sons and Comanche way of life. She began refusing food and water. She died in March 1871 at the O&#x27;Quinn home and was buried in Foster Cemetery on County Road 478 in Anderson County near Poynor.

There is some confusion about Parker&#x27;s birth and death dates. Different sources place her birth from 1825 to 1827 in Coles, Clark, or Crawford counties of Illinois, and her death from 1864 to 1871 in Anderson County. The only record of her death, given as March 1871, is found in the unpublished notebook of Susan Parker St. John. The only known document from the period supports the March 1871 date; an 1870 census for Anderson County lists her as a member of the O&#x27;Quinn household, born &quot;abt 1825,&quot; age forty-five. Her tombstone marks her year of death as 1870.

In 1910, Parker&#x27;s son, Quanah, moved her remains and had them reinterred in Post Oak Mission Cemetery near Cache, Oklahoma. When he died in February 1911, he was buried next to her.

Their bodies were moved in 1957 to the Fort Sill Post Cemetery at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. In 1965 the state of Texas had Prairie Flower&#x27;s body moved from her grave in Edom, Van Zandt County, Texas, to be reinterred near her mother and brother.

==Legacy==
The city of Crowell, Texas, has held a Cynthia Ann Parker Festival to honor her memory. The town of Groesbeck holds an annual Christmas Festival at the site of old Fort Parker every December. It has been rebuilt on the original site to historic specifications.

===Film portrayal===
Author and screenwriter Michael Blake said that the character of Stands with a Fist in the 1990 film &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;, was actually based upon Parker.

<doc id="386965" wikidata="Q2143002" url="?curid=386965" title="Fluidized bed combustion">
<text>Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) is a combustion technology used to burn solid fuels.

In its most basic form, fuel particles are suspended in a hot, bubbling fluidity bed of ash and other particulate materials (sand, limestone etc.) through which jets of air are blown to provide the oxygen required for combustion or gasification. The resultant fast and intimate mixing of gas and solids promotes rapid heat transfer and chemical reactions within the bed. FBC plants are capable of burning a variety of low-grade solid fuels, including most types of coal, coal waste and woody biomass, at high efficiency and without the necessity for expensive fuel preparation (e.g., pulverising). In addition, for any given thermal duty, FBCs are smaller than the equivalent conventional furnace, so may offer significant advantages over the latter in terms of cost and flexibility.

FBC reduces the amount of sulfur emitted in the form of SO&quot;x&quot; emissions. Limestone is used to precipitate out sulfate during combustion, which also allows more efficient heat transfer from the boiler to the apparatus used to capture the heat energy (usually water tubes). The heated precipitate coming in direct contact with the tubes (heating by conduction) increases the efficiency. Since this allows coal plants to burn at cooler temperatures, less NO&quot;x&quot; is also emitted. However, burning at low temperatures also causes increased polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emissions. FBC boilers can burn fuels other than coal, and the lower temperatures of combustion () have other added benefits as well.

== Benefits ==
There are two reasons for the rapid increase of FBC in combustors. First, the liberty of choice in respect of fuels in general, not only the possibility of using fuels which are difficult to burn using other technologies, is an important advantage of fluidized bed combustion. The second reason, which has become increasingly important, is the possibility of achieving, during combustion, a low emission of nitric oxides and the possibility of removing sulfur in a simple manner by using limestone as bed material.

Fluidized-bed combustion evolved from efforts to find a combustion process able to control pollutant emissions without external emission controls (such as scrubbers-flue gas desulfurization). The technology burns fuel at temperatures of , well below the threshold where nitrogen oxides form (at approximately , the nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the combustion air combine to form nitrogen oxide pollutants); it also avoids the ash melting problems related to high combustion temperature. The mixing action of the fluidized bed brings the flue gases into contact with a sulfur-absorbing chemical, such as limestone or dolomite. More than 95% of the sulfur pollutants in coal can be captured inside the boiler by the sorbent. The reductions may be less substantial than they seem, however, as they coincide with dramatic increases in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and possibly other carbon compound emissions. 

Commercial FBC units operate at competitive efficiencies, cost less than today&#x27;s conventional boiler units, and have SO2 and NO2 emissions below levels mandated by Federal standards. However, they have some disadvantages such as erosion on the tubes inside the boiler, uneven temperature distribution caused by clogs on the air inlet of the bed, long starting times reaching up to 48 hours in some cases.

# FBC has a lower combustion temperature of 750 °C whereas an ordinary boiler operates at 850 °C.
# FBC has low sintering process (melting of Ash).
# Lower production of NOx due to lower temperature.
# Lower production of SOx due to capture by limestone.
# Higher combustion efficiency due to 10 times more heat transfer than other combustion processes because of burning particle.
# Less area is required for FBC due to high coefficient of convective heat transfer.
# Iso-thermal bed combustion as temperature in free belt and active belt remain constant.

== Types ==
FBC systems fit into essentially two major groups, atmospheric systems (FBC) and pressurized systems (PFBC), and two minor subgroups, bubbling (BFB) and circulating fluidized bed (CFB).

===Atmospheric Fluidized Bed Combustion ===
Atmospheric fluidized beds use limestone or dolomite to capture sulfur released by the combustion of coal. Jets of air suspend the mixture of sorbent and burning coal during combustion, converting the mixture into a suspension of red-hot particles that flow like a fluid. These boilers operate at atmospheric pressure.

=== Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion ===
The first-generation PFBC system also uses a sorbent and jets of air to suspend the mixture of sorbent and burning coal during combustion. However, these systems operate at elevated pressures and produce a high-pressure gas stream at temperatures that can drive a gas turbine. Steam generated from the heat in the fluidized bed is sent to a steam turbine, creating a highly efficient combined cycle system.

====Advanced PFBC====
* A 1½ generation PFBC system increases the gas turbine firing temperature by using natural gas in addition to the vitiated air from the PFB combustor. This mixture is burned in a topping combustor to provide higher inlet temperatures for greater combined cycle efficiency. However, this uses natural gas, usually a higher priced fuel than coal.
* APFBC. In more advanced second-generation PFBC systems, a pressurized carbonizer is incorporated to process the feed coal into fuel gas and char. The PFBC burns the char to produce steam and to heat combustion air for the gas turbine. The fuel gas from the carbonizer burns in a topping combustor linked to a gas turbine, heating the gases to the combustion turbine&#x27;s rated firing temperature. Heat is recovered from the gas turbine exhaust in order to produce steam, which is used to drive a conventional steam turbine, resulting in a higher overall efficiency for the combined cycle power output. These systems are also called APFBC, or advanced circulating pressurized fluidized-bed combustion combined cycle systems. An APFBC system is entirely coal-fueled.
* GFBCC. Gasification fluidized-bed combustion combined cycle systems, GFBCC, have a pressurized circulating fluidized-bed (PCFB) partial gasifier feeding fuel syngas to the gas turbine topping combustor. The gas turbine exhaust supplies combustion air for the atmospheric circulating fluidized-bed combustor that burns the char from the PCFB partial gasifier.
* CHIPPS. A CHIPPS system is similar, but uses a furnace instead of an atmospheric fluidized-bed combustor. It also has gas turbine air preheater tubes to increase gas turbine cycle efficiency. CHIPPS stands for combustion-based high performance power system.

<doc id="386966" wikidata="Q651223" url="?curid=386966" title="Pneumoconiosis">
<text>Pneumoconiosis is the general term for a class of interstitial lung disease where inhalation of dust (for example, ash dust, lead particles, pollen grains etc) has caused interstitial fibrosis. The three most common types are asbestosis, silicosis, and coal miner&#x27;s lung. Pneumoconiosis often causes restrictive impairment, although diagnosable pneumoconiosis can occur without measurable impairment of lung function. Depending on extent and severity, it may cause death within months or years, or it may never produce symptoms. It is usually an occupational lung disease, typically from years of dust exposure during work in mining; textile milling; shipbuilding, ship repairing, and/or shipbreaking; sandblasting; industrial tasks; rock drilling (subways or building pilings); or agriculture. It is one of the most common occupational diseases in the world.

==Types==
Depending upon the type of dust, the disease is given different names:
* Coalworker&#x27;s pneumoconiosis (also known as coal miner&#x27;s lung, black lung or anthracosis) – coal, carbon
* Aluminosis – Aluminium
* Asbestosis – asbestos
* Silicosis (also known as &quot;grinder&#x27;s disease&quot; or Potter&#x27;s rot) – crystalline silica dust
* Bauxite fibrosis – bauxite
* Berylliosis – beryllium
* Siderosis – iron
* Byssinosis – Byssinosis is caused by cotton dust inhalation and typically demonstrates a different pattern of lung abnormalities from most other pneumoconiosis.
* Chalicosis – fine dust from stonecutting
* Silicosiderosis (also sometimes called iron miner&#x27;s lung) – mixed dust containing silica and iron
* Labrador lung (found in miners in Labrador, Canada) – mixed dust containing iron, silica and anthophyllite, a type of asbestos
* Stannosis – tin oxide
* Talcosis – talc
* Baritosis - a benign type of pneumoconiosis caused by barium inhalation; it typically causes little or no overgrowth, hardening, and/or fibrosis.
* Mixed-dust pneumoconiosis

==Pathogenesis==
The reaction of the lung to mineral dusts depends on many variables, including size, shape, solubility, and reactivity of the particles. For example, particles greater than 5 to 10 μm are unlikely to reach distal airways, whereas particles smaller than 0.5 μm move into and out of alveoli, often without substantial deposition and injury. Particles that are 1 to 5 μm in diameter are the most dangerous, because they lodge at the bifurcation of the distal airways. Coal dust is relatively inert, and large amounts must be deposited in the lungs before lung disease is clinically detectable. Silica, asbestos, and beryllium are more reactive than coal dust, resulting in fibrotic reactions at lower concentrations. Most inhaled dust is entrapped in the mucus blanket and rapidly removed from the lung by ciliary movement. However, some of the particles become stuck at alveolar duct bifurcations, where macrophages accumulate and engulf the trapped particulates. The pulmonary alveolar macrophage is a key cellular element in the initiation and perpetuation of lung injury and fibrosis. Many particles activate the inflammasome and induce IL-1 production. The more reactive particles trigger the macrophages to release a number of products that mediate an inflammatory response and initiate fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. Some of the inhaled particles may reach the lymphatics either by direct drainage or within migrating macrophages and thereby initiate an immune response to components of the particulates and/or to self-proteins that are modified by the particles. This then leads to an amplification and extension of the local reaction. Tobacco smoking worsens the effects of all inhaled mineral dusts, more so with asbestos than with any other particle.

==Diagnosis==
Typical indications on patient assessment include:
* Cough
* Shortness of breath
* Chest tightness
* Chest X-ray may show a characteristic patchy, subpleural, bibasilar interstitial infiltrates or small cystic radiolucencies called honeycombing, particularly in advanced disease.

Pneumoconiosis in combination with multiple pulmonary rheumatoid nodules in rheumatoid arthritis patients is known as Caplan&#x27;s syndrome.

==Epidemiology==
The prevalence as of 2021 of pneumoconiosis is around 527,500 cases, with over 60,000 new patients reported globally in 2017. Prevalence has trended somewhat downward since 2015. The mortality of pneumoconiosis patients remained at a high level in recent years, with over 21,000 deaths each year since 2015. It is likely that pneumoconiosis is under-diagnosed and under-reported, especially in countries without highly developed healthcare systems.

== Treatment and Prognosis ==
 
Lung damage due to pneumoconiosis cannot be reversed. However, some steps can slow down disease progression and relieve symptoms. These include the prescription of medications and breathing treatments to open airways and reduce inflammation. Pulmonary rehabilitation and supplemental oxygen may also be recommended. A lung transplant may be needed in cases of serious diseases. If the patient smokes, smoking cessation is also important. Regular testing, such as X-rays or lung function tests, may be indicated to monitor disease progression.

== Prevention ==
To reduce the likelihood of developing pneumoconiosis, individuals working in affected industries should wear a mask, wash skin that comes in contact with dust, remove dust from clothing and wash the face and hands before eating or drinking. In addition, governments often regulate industry, especially mines, to limit how much dust is in the air. In the United States, coal miners injured by pneumoconiosis and their families may receive monthly payments and medical benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act.

<text>Bureaucracy is an interactive fiction video game released by Infocom in 1987, scripted by comic science fiction author Douglas Adams. Infocom&#x27;s twenty-fourth game, it is part of the Infocom Plus range which requires a machine with a minimum of 128K of memory.

==Plot==
The player must confront a long and complicated series of bureaucratic hurdles resulting from a recent change of address. Mail is being delivered to the wrong address, bank accounts are inaccessible, and nothing is as it should be. The game includes a measure of simulated blood pressure which rises when &quot;frustrating&quot; events happen and lowers after a period of no annoying events. Once a certain blood pressure level is reached, the player suffers an aneurysm and the game ends.

While undertaking the seemingly simple task of retrieving misdirected mail, the player encounters a number of bizarre characters, including an antisocial hacker, a paranoid weapons enthusiast, and a tribe of Zalagasan cannibals. At the same time, the player must deal with impersonal corporations, counterintuitive airport logic, and a hungry llama.

==Gameplay==
Infocom rated &quot;Bureaucracy&quot; as &quot;Advanced&quot; in its difficulty rating system.

The game begins with a short online &quot;software registration form&quot; displayed on the screen. After the form has been completed, the game uses the given information after appropriately mangling it. (For example, the game will persistently address the player as the wrong gender, and whatever the player enters as &quot;least favourite colour&quot; will appear in numerous descriptions.)

The game has 50 locations.

==Release==
The &quot;Bureaucracy&quot; packaging includes the following physical items:
#A pamphlet entitled &quot;You&#x27;re ready to move!&quot; from the fictional bank Fillmore Fiduciary Trust
#A flier advertising the fictional magazine &quot;Popular Paranoia&quot;
#A welcome letter from the player&#x27;s new employer, Happitec Corporation
#A Fillmore &quot;Better Beezer&quot; credit card application form (each sheet of the triplicate carbon copy form had different instructions and questions)
#A very skinny pencil (similar to those provided at banks)

==Reception==
&quot;Bureaucracy&quot; sold 40,000 copies. &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; praised its parser and feelies, and liked the player&#x27;s actions directly affecting blood pressure. Game reviewers Hartley and Patricia Lesser complimented &quot;Bureaucracy&quot; in their &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column in &quot;Dragon&quot; #124 (1987), calling it &quot;an outrageous journey through red tape that puts you directly in the middle of a bureaucratic muddle so convoluted that you can&#x27;t help but laugh.&quot; Jerry Pournelle named &quot;Bureaucracy&quot; as his game of the month for October 1987, stating that he and Larry Niven became &quot;engrossed&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described it as &quot;a linear adventure with some very tough puzzles in the midst of some incredible madness&quot;.
