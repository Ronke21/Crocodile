<text>Leonard Percy Lord, 1st Baron Lambury KBE (15 November 1896 – 13 September 1967) was a captain of the British motor industry.

==Background and education==
Leonard Percy Lord was born on 16 November 1896 in Coventry and was the youngest child in his family. Lord was the son of William Lord, of Coventry, and Emma, daughter of George Swain. He was educated at Bablake School, Coventry. The school had a fully equipped carpenter&#x27;s workshop and a working forge. Leonard did well enough and his fees, like many of the Bablake&#x27;s boys, were paid for by Coventry Education Committee. He left the school at the age of 16 after his father&#x27;s death. He used the technical training he had received at school to get a job at Courtaulds as a jig draughtsman.

==Automotive career==

He moved to Vickers, before joining Coventry Ordnance Works, a munitions factory in Coventry, for the duration of the First World War. Lord worked for a number of engineering firms after the war. After 1918 Lord worked in a manufacturing plant for Daimler engines. In 1923 he moved to Morris Motors Limited where he was involved in rationalising all stages of the production process. In 1927 Morris bought Wolseley Motors Limited, and Lord was transferred there in order to modernise their production equipment. In 1932 Lord was promoted to General Manager at Morris, working from the Cowley factory. He was so effective that in 1933 William Morris made him Managing Director of Morris Motors itself. By 1934 Morris was a multi-millionaire bearing the title Lord Nuffield in recognition of his generous charitable donations and his business empire had become the Nuffield Organization. In August 1936 Leonard resigned. In 1937 Nuffield appointed his now unemployed friend as manager of the Nuffield Trust for Special Areas with £2 million for distribution to development schemes benefitting areas in economic distress. But Lord was looking for a way back into the industry and in 1938 after many years of conflict with William Morris, Lord left to join Morris&#x27;s chief competitor, the Austin Motor Company.

At that time, Herbert Austin was looking for somebody to direct his company, his only son having been killed during the war. Ultimately, Lord was selected to manage the company. Lord Austin died in 1941 and Lord became the most powerful man in the company. With the advent of the Second World War, Austin converted from civil to military production, in particular ambulances and government vehicles. After the war, Lord became Chairman of Austin and the company resumed civil motor-vehicle production in 1946. He promoted his company and set up plants in Canada, Australia, Argentina, South Africa and Mexico. In 1954 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). Through further mergers and acquisitions, including the huge 1952 merger with his former employer the Nuffield Organization (with Lord&#x27;s Austin very much the senior partner), Lord ultimately became president of the British Motor Corporation. Following its creation, Lord often joked that BMC stood for, &quot;Bugger My Competitors&quot;. On 26 March 1962 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Lambury, &quot;of Northfield in the County of Warwick&quot;.

== Death ==
Leonard Lord died in 1967, at the age of 70, during the discussions which ultimately formed British Leyland. The editor of &quot;Commercial Motor&quot; magazine, H. Brian Cottee, in an obituary written shortly after Lord&#x27;s death opined that he was &quot;at heart a production engineer, and an immensely able one at that&quot;, and &quot;one of the great engineer-administrators of the motor industry&quot;. Cottee described him as &quot;tough, capable, sometimes blunt&quot; with &quot;a wry humour and a sometimes surprising humility&quot;. 

==Legacy==

Although Lord had success in his early career, his legacy was a sprawling and unprofitable product range, weak distribution and feeble management at British Leyland – ills which took their toll on the company.

He has contributed in the essential modernization of production methods at both Cowley and Longbridge, making the British motor industry compatible in world markets. He developed an export output of Britain&#x27;s post-war economics. Finally, though he initiated the union of the industry&#x27;s two major rivals, it was difficult to ensure that the two elements worked in harmony.
In a review of the Longbridge operation, Graham Searjeant, Financial Editor of &quot;The Times&quot; (31 May 2007) notes that Lord was a &quot;foul-mouthed, hard-driving production man&quot;. Searjeant credits some of the failures at Longbridge to Lord&#x27;s &quot;lack of vision&quot; and the &quot;inadequacy&quot; of his protégé-successor, George Harriman. Lord&#x27;s biographer, Martyn Nutland, thinks this is unfair, and that Lord dealt imaginatively with the inescapable circumstances of the day. It was Lord who persuaded Alec Issigonis to rejoin BMC to create what became the Mini and the 1100, Austin/BMC&#x27;s two most successful products. That Issigonis had the freedom to create such revolutionary cars is thanks to the mandate given to him by Lord. Gillian Bardsley, Archivist of the British Motor Heritage Trust, in her biography of Alec Issigonis, credits Lord with the vision that BMC needed an entirely new range of cars if it was to remain competitive into the 1960s.

==Personal life==
Lord married Ethel Lily, daughter of George Horton, in 1921. They had three daughters.

Lord, who had been raised to the peerage as Baron Lambury in 1962, died in September 1967, aged 70. With Lord Lambury having no son, the barony became extinct upon his death.

<text>William Richard Morris, Viscount Nuffield (10 October 1877 – 22 August 1963), was an English motor manufacturer and philanthropist. He was the founder of Morris Motors Limited and is remembered for establishing the Nuffield Foundation, the Nuffield Trust and Nuffield College, Oxford, as well as being involved in his role as president of BUPA in creating what is now Nuffield Health. He took his title from the village of Nuffield, Oxfordshire, where he lived.

Initially Morris Motors relied heavily on Oxford&#x27;s local labour force, and William Morris became the largest employer in the city. However during the 1920s and 1930s, Oxford saw a dramatic size and population increase following large numbers of unemployed people from depressed areas of Britain seeking work in Morris&#x27;s factories. This time period was marked with frequent attempts of industrial action protesting against the low pay and poor working conditions in Morris&#x27;s factories. The first successful strike in a Morris factory was achieved in 1934, led by Communist Party activist Abe Lazarus with support from local Labour Party activists.

William Morris was politically anti-union, anti-Semitic, and a key financier of Sir Oswald Mosley and British fascism. Morris gave Mosley £35,000 to fund the anti-Semitic newspaper &quot;Action&quot;, and £50,000 in 1930 to finance Mosley&#x27;s fascist New Party, which was subsequently absorbed into the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Morris was also a subscriber to anti-Jewish publications, and his personal papers detailed his belief that the government of England was controlled by Jews. Despite Morris&#x27;s personal political beliefs, the workers employed in his factories contributed to ushering a wave of left wing political activism across Oxford during the 1930s.

==Background==
Morris was born in 1877 at 47 Comer Gardens, a terraced house in the Comer Gardens area of Worcester, England, about northwest of the centre of the city. He was the son of Frederick Morris and his wife Emily Ann, daughter of Richard Pether. When he was three years old his family moved to 16 James Street, Oxford.

==Career==
===Before motor car manufacture===

Upon leaving school at the age of 15, William Morris was apprenticed to a local bicycle-seller and repairer. Nine months later, after his employer refused him a pay increase, aged 16 he set up a business repairing bicycles in a shed at the back of his parents&#x27; house. This business being a success he opened a shop at 48 High Street and began to assemble as well as repair bicycles, labelling his product with a gilt cycle wheel and &quot;The Morris&quot;. Morris raced his own machines competing as far away as south London. He did not confine himself to one distance or time and at one point was champion of Oxford (City and County), Berkshire and Buckinghamshire for distances varying between one and fifty miles.

He began to work with motorcycles in 1901, designing the Morris Motor Cycle, and in 1902 acquired buildings in Longwall Street from which he repaired bicycles; operated a taxi service; and sold, repaired and hired-out cars. He held the agency for Arrol-Johnston, Belsize, Humber, Hupmobile, Singer, Standard and Wolseley cars. In 1910 he built new premises in Longwall Street, described by a local newspaper as The Oxford Motor Palace, changed his business&#x27;s name from ‘The Oxford Garage’ to ‘The Morris Garage’ and still had to take more premises in Queen Street. The Longwall Street site was redeveloped in 1980, retaining the original frontage, and is now used as student accommodation by New College.

===Motor car manufacturing 1920s===

In 1912 he designed a car, the &quot;bullnose&quot; Morris, and, using bought-in components (including engines and axles from the USA), he began to build them at a disused military training college in Cowley, Oxford. The outbreak of World War I saw the nascent car factory largely given over to the production of munitions—including 50,000 minesinkers for the North Sea Minefield—but in 1919 car production revived rising from 400 cars in that year to 56,000 in 1925. Morris pioneered the introduction to the United Kingdom of Henry Ford&#x27;s techniques of mass production. During the period 1919–1925 he built or purchased factories at Abingdon, Birmingham and Swindon to add to those in Oxford.

In February 1927, in competition against—amongst others—its creator, Herbert Austin, Morris paid £730,000 for the assets of the collapsed Wolseley Motors Limited which became his personal property. Wolseley were at this stage in fairly advanced development of an overhead camshaft 8 hp car, which he launched as the first Morris Minor in 1928. The original MG Midget, launched in 1929, was based on the Minor.

When major component suppliers had difficulties he purchased them on his own account. His American engines were now made under licence for him by Hotchkiss in Coventry. When in 1923 they were unwilling to expand production Morris bought their business and called it Morris Engines Limited. It would become Morris engines branch when he later sold it to Morris Motors. Again when back-axle manufacturer EG Wrigley and Company ran into financial difficulties he bought and reconstituted it as Morris Commercial Cars Limited to manufacture an expanded truck and bus offering. Following the same policy he bought the manufacturer of SU Carburettors in 1926.

Impressed by American all-steel bodies he persuaded Edward G Budd of Budd Corporation to enter a joint venture with him called Pressed Steel Company which erected their large factory at Cowley opposite Morris&#x27;s own and with a connecting bridge in 1926. At that point the two business tycoons had each met their match. Eventually in 1930 the High Court ended their disagreements by obliging Morris to surrender his and his colleagues&#x27; membership of the Pressed Steel board and all Morris holdings and Morris lost all the capital he had invested in the venture.

=== Motor car manufacturing 1930s ===

Morris was &quot;the most famous industrialist of his age&quot;. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1938 he was further ennobled as Viscount Nuffield. In September 1938 he bought the bankrupt Riley (Coventry) and Autovia companies from the Riley family selling them to Morris Motors Limited. He had added another personal investment, Wolseley Motors Limited, to the portfolio of Morris Motors Limited in 1935. After he was ennobled as Baron Nuffield instead of the Morris Organization the whole gallery of all his personal enterprises were promoted as the Nuffield Organization. There was no legal substance to either of these groupings.

=== Factory strike of 1934 ===
In July 1934 a strike took place in a Morris&#x27; factory which historians have described as a &quot;spontaneous walkout&quot; of approximately 180 workers. William Morris was politically anti-union and had boasted that he would refuse to recognise any unions at his factory, stating &quot;I never allow the trade unions to interfere with me.&quot; Although the workers had no specific demands, their reasons for walking out ranged from low wages to terrible working conditions. Upon hearing of the strike, the Communist Party of Great Britain sent the striking workers an experienced trades union activist and strike leader called Abraham Lazarus (aka Firestone Bill), who would later become a key political figure among Oxford&#x27;s working classes. Before the strike there was very little trade union activity in Morris&#x27; factories.

On the 11th day of the strike the managers gave way and Morris&#x27; factories agreed to increase wages and to permit the establishment of trade unions within Morris&#x27; factories. Following this victory, all of the organisations which supported the strike benefitted from increased support. The Labour Party saw a resurgence in Oxford, the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union saw an increase in members, and the Communist Party of Great Britain won the support of the majority of Morris factory workers. The success of the strike at Morris&#x27; also led to communist political beliefs gaining more widespread acceptance across Oxford.

===World War II===
The Supermarine Spitfire was a technically advanced aircraft. Though ordered by the Air Ministry in March 1936 by early 1938 no single plane had been made. Lord Nuffield had offered his own expertise, and that of his Morris Organization, to design and construct a vast new factory at Castle Bromwich, to his own ideas of industrial planning, claiming he would build four times as many planes there as any other factory in the country. Although the Treasury initially opposed the idea, having concerns about his control over the design of the project and its costs, the huge &quot;Nuffield Project&quot; was approved at a cost of £1.125 million by the Secretary of State for Air and Morris, now Nuffield, placed in charge of it. Within a year, with the factory still not built, the costs had increased to £4.15 million mainly due to constant changes in site layout and design. Nuffield had claimed he could produce 60 Spitfires a week but by May 1940, the height of the Battle of France, not one Spitfire had been built at Castle Bromwich. That month Lord Beaverbrook was placed in charge of all aircraft production, Nuffield was sacked and the plant handed over to Vickers, Supermarine&#x27;s parent company. Vickers had inherited such a confused construction programme that even by 1942 building work was still going on and the project&#x27;s accounts were not finally signed off by the Treasury until March 1944. As early as 1942, cracks in the brickwork of the principal building were discovered by Vickers, due to differential expansion of the various types of bricks used in the different stages of construction. Possibly as a result of this débâcle, in 1941 Nuffield invited Mrs Dorothée Martin to join his organisation to advise him on his war work.

===Post-war===

Morris Motors Limited merged with Austin Motor Company in 1952 in the new holding company, British Motor Corporation (BMC), of which Nuffield was chairman for its first year.

Viscount Nuffield retired as a director of BMC on 17 December 1952 at the age of 75, taking on the title of honorary president instead. Although succeeded as chairman by Leonard Lord, as honorary president he attended his office regularly and continued to advise his colleagues.

==Personal life and philanthropy==

Morris married Elizabeth Anstey on 9 April 1903. They had no children, and he disbursed a large part of his fortune to charitable causes.

He founded Nuffield College, Oxford, in 1937, a post-graduate college and the University&#x27;s first co-educational college.

In 1937 he gave £50,000 to fund the expansion of the Sea Cadet Corps, donated £60,000 to the University of Birmingham for the Nuffield building, to house a cyclotron, In December 1938 he offered to give an iron lung (see Both respirator) made in his factory to any hospital in Britain and the Empire that requested one; over 1,700 were distributed. He also founded the Nuffield Foundation in 1943 with an endowment of £10 million in order to advance education and social welfare.

On his death the ownership of his former Oxfordshire home, Nuffield Place and its contents, passed to Nuffield College who opened it to the public on a limited basis. Although a sale had been mooted, it was passed to the National Trust and is open to the public on a regular basis.

He is also commemorated in the Morris Motors Museum at the Oxford Bus Museum. Morris also has a building named after him at Coventry University, at Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London and a theatre at the University of Southampton. The Lady Nuffield Care Home in North Oxford is named after his wife.

His home in James Street now has a blue plaque. He died in August 1963, aged 85. The baronetcy and two peerages died with him as he was childless. He was cremated, and his ashes lie in Nuffield churchyard, beside his wife&#x27;s.

=== Anti-Semitism and support for fascism ===
Historians have described William Morris as politically anti-union and anti-Semitic, often citing the fact that he was a key financer of Sir Oswald Mosley and British fascism. Between 1931 and 1932, Morris gave Mosley £35,000 to fund the anti-Semitic newspaper &quot;Action&quot;, and £50,000 in 1930 to finance Mosley&#x27;s fascist New Party, which was subsequently absorbed into the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Mosley spoke highly of Morris, once regarding Morris as his &#x27;chief backer&#x27; and praised Morris as &quot;a good and honest man.&quot; Following the deteriorating reputation of the British Union of Fascists, Morris ceased giving any public support to British fascists after 1932. Despite ceasing to publicly support fascism, Morris retained his subscription to anti-Semitic newspapers for many more years. In 1934, Nuffield issued a public statement through &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; repudiating fascism and antisemitism while also announcing a donation made to the Central British Fund for German Jewry in support of European Jewish refugees. 

Historian of British fascism Dave Renton describes William Morris as &quot;the most important example&quot; of a wealthy supporter of Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s fascist movement. Renton also describes Morris as being &quot;fiercely anti-Semitic&quot; in his private life, citing that for many years he was a subscriber to Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s anti-Jewish newspaper &quot;The Patriot&quot;. According to Renton, William Morris&#x27;s personal papers contain several anti-Semitic and pro-fascist comments, including one example which says: &#x27;it is a well-known fact that every government in my England is Jew controlled regardless of the Party in power.&#x27;

Despite Morris&#x27;s personal political beliefs, the workers employed in his factories that organised against their low pay and harsh working conditions would contribute to ushering a wave of left wing political activism across Oxford during the 1930s.

===Attempted kidnap===
In May 1938, a serial blackmailer, Patrick Tuellman, tried to kidnap Lord Nuffield for a £100,000 ransom. But Tuellman had an accomplice who betrayed his plan to Oxford City Police. The force briefed Nuffield and planned to catch Tuellman in the attempt. Nuffield took a keen interest in the preparations and insisted on attending every meeting.

On 28 May police ambushed Tuellman in Cowley in his car. Officers found him to be in possession of two automatic pistols, ammunition and items of disguise. Birmingham Assizes tried Tuellman and on 22 July convicted him. He served seven years&#x27; penal servitude.

<doc id="375565" wikidata="Q3001185" url="?curid=375565" title="Jewish religious movements">
<text>Jewish religious movements, sometimes called &quot;denominations&quot;, include diverse groups within Judaism which have developed among Jews from ancient times. Samaritans are also considered ethnic Jews by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, although they are frequently classified by experts as a sister Hebrew people, who practice a separate branch of Israelite religion. Today in the west, the most prominent divisions are between traditionalist Orthodox movements (including ultratraditionalist and Modern Orthodox branches) and modernist movements such as Reform Judaism originating in late 18th century Europe, Conservative () originating in 19th century Europe, and other smaller ones, including the Reconstructionist and Renewal movements which emerged later in the 20th century in the United States.

In Israel, variation is moderately similar, differing from the west in having roots in the Old Yishuv and pre-to-early-state Yemenite infusion, among other influences. For statistical and practical purposes, the distinctions there are based upon a person&#x27;s attitude to religion. Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as &quot;secular&quot; (), &quot;traditional&quot; (), &quot;religious&quot; () or &quot;ultra-religious&quot; ().

The western and Israeli movements differ in their views on various issues (as do those of other Jewish communities). These issues include the level of observance, the methodology for interpreting and understanding Jewish law, biblical authorship, textual criticism, and the nature or role of the messiah (or messianic age). Across these movements, there are marked differences in liturgy, especially in the language in which services are conducted, with the more traditional movements emphasizing Hebrew. The sharpest theological division occurs between traditional Orthodox and the greater number of non-Orthodox Jews adhering to other movements (or to none), such that the non-Orthodox are sometimes referred to collectively as the &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;progressive streams&quot;.

Other divisions of Judaism in the world reflect being more ethnically and geographically rooted, e.g., Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews), and Bene Israel (among the ancient Jewish communities of India). Normatively, Judaism excludes from its composition certain groups that may name or consider themselves ethnic Jews but hold key beliefs in sharp contradiction, for example, modern or ancient Messianic Jews.

== Terminology ==
Some Jews reject the term &quot;denomination&quot; as a label for different groups and ideologies within Judaism, arguing that the notion of denomination has a specifically Christian resonance that does not translate easily into the Jewish context. However, in recent years the &quot;American Jewish Year Book&quot; has adopted &quot;denomination&quot;, as have many scholars and theologians.

Commonly used terms are &quot;movements&quot;, as well as &quot;denominations&quot;, &quot;varieties&quot;, &quot;traditions&quot;, &quot;groupings&quot;, &quot;streams&quot;, &quot;branches&quot;, &quot;sectors&quot; and &quot;sects&quot; (for some groups), &quot;trends&quot;, and such. Sometimes, as an option, only three main currents of Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative and Reform) are named traditions, and divisions within them are called movements.

The Jewish groups themselves reject characterization as sects. Sects are traditionally defined as religious subgroups that have broken off from the main body, and this separation usually becomes irreparable over time. Within Judaism, individuals and families often switch affiliation, and individuals are free to marry one another, although the major denominations disagree on who is a Jew. It is not unusual for clergy and Jewish educators trained in one of the liberal denominations to serve in another, and left with no choice, many small Jewish communities combine elements of several movements to achieve a viable level of membership.

Relationships between Jewish religious movements are varied; they are sometimes marked by interdenominational cooperation outside of the realm of &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law), such as the New York Board of Rabbis, and sometimes not. Some of the movements sometimes cooperate by uniting with one another in community federations and in campus organizations such as the Hillel Foundation. Jewish religious denominations are distinct from, but often linked to, Jewish ethnic divisions and Jewish political movements.

== Samaritanism ==

The Samaritans consider themselves direct descendants of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which was conquered by Assyria in 722 BC. Modern genetics suggests some truth in both the Samaritan claims and the Talmudic Jews&#x27; claims.

The Samaritan Torah preserves a version of the Torah in slightly altered forms. The first historical references to the Samaritans date from the Babylonian captivity. According to the Talmud, the Samaritans are to be treated as Jews in matters in which their practices conform to the mainstream, but are otherwise treated as non-Jews. The Samaritans have dwindled to two communities of about 840 individuals. One such community is located in the Israeli city of Holon, while the other is located near Nablus on Mount Gerizim, in the West Bank .

Today, Samaritans must officially undergo a formal conversion to Judaism in order to be considered Jewish. One example is Israeli TV personality Sophie Tzedaka, who was raised Samaritan and converted to Judaism at the age of 18.

== Sects in the Second Temple period ==

Prior to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Jews of the Roman province of Judaea were divided into several movements, sometimes warring among themselves: Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Zealots, and ultimately early Christians. Many historic sources such as Flavius Josephus, the New Testament and the recovered fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls, attest to the divisions among Jews at this time. Rabbinical writings from later periods, including the Talmud, further attest these ancient schisms.

The main internal struggles during this era were between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, as well as the early Christians, and also the Essenes and Zealots. The Pharisees wanted to maintain the authority and traditions of classical Torah teachings and began the early teachings of the Mishna, maintaining the authority of the Sanhedrin, the supreme Jewish court. According to Josephus, the Sadducees differed from the Pharisees on a number of doctrinal grounds, notably rejecting ideas of life after death. They appear to have dominated the aristocracy and the temple, but their influence over the wider Jewish population was limited. The Essenes preached an ascetic way of life. The Zealots advocated armed rebellion against any foreign power such as Rome. All were at violent logger-heads with each other, leading to the confusion and disunity that ended with the destruction of the Second Temple and the sacking of Jerusalem by Rome. The Jewish Christians were the original Jewish followers of Jesus. The radical interpretation of Moses&#x27; Law by Jesus&#x27; disciples and their belief he is the Son of God, along with the development of the New Testament, ensured that Christianity and Judaism would become distinctively different religions.

== Rabbinic Judaism ==

Most streams of modern Judaism developed from the Pharisaic movement, which became known as Rabbinic Judaism (in Hebrew — יהדות רבנית) with the compilation of the Oral Torah into the Mishna. After the Bar Kokhba revolt and the destruction of the Second Temple the other movements disappeared from the historical record, yet the Sadducees probably kept on existing in a non-organized form for at least several more decades.

== Non-Rabbinic Judaism ==

Non-Rabbinic Judaism—Sadducees, Nazarenes, Karaite Judaism, and Haymanot—contrasts with Rabbinic Judaism and does not recognize the Oral Torah as a divine authority nor the rabbinic procedures used to interpret Jewish scripture.

=== Karaite Judaism ===
The tradition of the &quot;Qara&#x27;im&quot; survives in Karaite Judaism, started in the early 9th century when non-rabbinic sages like Benjamin Nahawandi and their followers took the rejection of the Oral Torah by Anan ben David to the new level of seeking the plain meaning of the Tanakh&#x27;s text. Karaite Jews accept only the Tanakh as divinely inspired, not recognizing the authority that Rabbinites ascribe to basic rabbinic works like the Talmud and the Midrashim.

=== Haymanot===
Haymanot (meaning &quot;religion&quot; in Ge&#x27;ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic Judaism but share significant similarities to Karaite Judaism and Samaritanism. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge&#x27;ez, not Hebrew, However many words are ascribed in Hebrew. Dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like Sigd. 

== Ethno-cultural divisions&#x27; movements ==

Although there are numerous Jewish ethnic communities, there are several that are large enough to be considered predominant. Generally, they do not constitute separate religious branches within Judaism, but rather separate cultural traditions (nuschaot) and rites of prayer (minhagim). Ashkenazi Jews compose about 75% of the world&#x27;s Jewish population. Sephardi Jews and Mizrahi Jews compose the greatest part of the rest, with about 20% of the world&#x27;s Jewish population. Israel has two Chief Rabbi—one for the Ashkenazic, another for the Sephardic with Mizrahi Jews. The remaining 5% of Jews are divided among a wide array of small groups (such as various groups of African Jews, most prominently the Beta Israel from Ethiopia who follow the Haymanot branch of Judaism), some of which are nearing extinction as a result of assimilation and intermarriage into surrounding non-Jewish cultures or surrounding Jewish cultures. Additionally, special ethnoreligious divisions are also the Italian rite Jews and the Greek Romaniote Jews. Both groups are considered distinct from Ashkenazim and Sephardim.

The Enlightenment had a tremendous effect on Jewish identity and on ideas about the importance and role of Jewish observance. Due to the geographical distribution and the geopolitical entities affected by the Enlightenment, this philosophical revolution essentially affected only the Ashkenazi community; however, because of the predominance of the Ashkenazi community in Israeli politics and in Jewish leadership worldwide, the effects have been significant for all Jews.

=== Sephardic and Mizrahi Judaism ===

Sephardic Judaism is the practice of Judaism as observed by the Sephardim (Iberian, Spanish-Portuguese Jews). The Mizrahi Jews (including Maghrebi) are all Oriental Jewry. Some definitions of &quot;Sephardic&quot; also include Mizrahi, many of whom follow the same traditions of worship but have different ethno-cultural traditions. So far as it is peculiar to themselves and not shared with other Jewish groups such as the Ashkenazim (German rite).

Sephardim are primarily the descendants of Jews from the Iberian Peninsula, such as most Jews from France and the Netherlands. They may be divided into the families that left in the Expulsion of 1492 and those that remained as crypto-Jews, Marranos and those who left in the following few centuries. In religious parlance, and by many in modern Israel, the term is used in a broader sense to include all Jews of Ottoman or other Asian or African backgrounds (Mizrahi Jews), whether or not they have any historic link to Spain, although some prefer to distinguish between Sephardim proper and Mizraḥi Jews.

Sephardic and Mizrachi Jewish synagogues are generally considered Orthodox or Sephardic Haredim by non-Sephardic Jews, and are primarily run according to the Orthodox tradition, even though many of the congregants may not keep a level of observance on par with traditional Orthodox belief. For example, many congregants will drive to the synagogue on the Shabbat, in violation of &quot;halakha&quot;, while discreetly entering the synagogue so as not to offend more observant congregants. However, not all Sephardim are Orthodox; among the pioneers of the Reform Judaism movement in the 1820s there was the Sephardic congregation Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina. A part of the European Sephardim were also linked with the Judaic modernization.

Unlike the predominantly Ashkenazic Reform, and Reconstructionist denominations, Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews who are not observant generally believe that Orthodox Judaism&#x27;s interpretation and legislation of &quot;halakha&quot; is appropriate, and true to the original philosophy of Judaism. That being said, Sephardic and Mizrachi rabbis tend to hold different, and generally more lenient, positions on &quot;halakha&quot; than their Ashkenazi counterparts, but since these positions are based on rulings of Talmudic scholars as well as well-documented traditions that can be linked back to well-known codifiers of Jewish law, Ashkenazic and Hasidic Rabbis do not believe that these positions are incorrect, but rather that they are the appropriate interpretation of &quot;halakha&quot; for Jews of Sephardic and Mizrachi descent.

The Yemenite Jews—the Dor Daim and other movements—use a separate Baladi-rite. The Yemenite and the Aramaic speaking Kurdish Jews are the only communities who maintain the tradition of reading the Torah in the synagogue in both Hebrew and the Aramaic Targum (&quot;translation&quot;). Most non-Yemenite synagogues have a specified person called a Baal Koreh, who reads from the Torah scroll when congregants are called to the Torah scroll for an aliyah. In the Yemenite tradition, each person called to the Torah scroll for an aliyah reads for himself.

The Shas, a religious political party in Israel, represents the interests of the Orthodox/Haredi Sephardim and Mizrahim.

=== Italian and Romaniote Judaism ===
A relatively small but influential ethnoreligious group in the intellectual circles of Israel are Italian rite Jews () who are neither Ashkenazi nor Sephardi. These are exclusively descendants of the ancient Roman Jewish community, not including later Ashkenazic and Sephardic migrants to Italy. They practice traditional Orthodox Judaism. The liturgy is served according to a special Italian Nusach (, a.k.a. ) and it has similarities with the nusach of the Greek Romaniote Jews.

The Romaniote Jews or the Romaniotes () native to the Eastern Mediterranean is the oldest Jewish community in Europe, whom name is refers to the Eastern Roman Empire. They are also distinct from the Ashkenazim and Sephardim. But, nowadays, few synagogues still use the Romaniote nusach and minhag.

=== Ashkenazic movements ===
==== Hasidic Judaism ====
Hasidic Judaism—a revivalist movement—was founded by Israel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), also known as the Baal Shem Tov, whose followers had previously called themselves &quot;Freylechn&quot; (&quot;happy ones&quot;) and now they call themselves (&quot;pious, holy ones&quot;). His charismatic disciples attracted many followers among Ashkenazi Jews, and they also established numerous Hasidic groups across Europe. The Baal Shem Tov came at a time when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling from the bewilderment and disappointment which were engendered in them by the two notorious Jewish false messiahs, Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791), and their respective followers. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. The Hasidim are organized into independent &quot;courts&quot; or dynasties, each dynasty is headed by its own hereditary spiritual leader-&quot;rebbe&quot;. Unlike other Ashkenazim, most Hasidim use some variation of &quot;Nusach Sefard&quot;, a blend of Ashkenazi and Sephardi liturgies, based on the innovations of the Kabbalist Isaac Luria. Neo-Hasidism is a term which refers to trends of interest in the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism which are expressed by members of other existing Jewish movements.

==== Lithuanian (&quot;Lita&#x27;im&quot;) ====

In the late 18th century, there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European traditionalist Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed (&quot;opponents&quot;) by the followers of the Baal Shem Tov. Lithuania became the centre of this opposition under the leadership of &quot;Vilna Gaon&quot; (Elijah ben Solomon Zalman), which adopted the epithets &quot;Litvishe&quot; (Yiddish word), &quot;Litvaks&quot; (in Slavic) or (in Hebrew) those epithets refer to Haredi Jews who are not Hasidim (and not Hardalim or Sephardic Haredim). Since then, all of the Hasidic Jewish groups have been theologically subsumed into mainstream Orthodox Judaism, particularly, Haredi Judaism, but cultural differences persist. In the 19th century, the Lithuanian spirituality was mainly incorporated into the Musar movement.

==== Post-Enlightenment movements ====
Late-18th-century Europe, and then the rest of the world, was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements that taken together were referred to as the Enlightenment. These movements promoted scientific thinking, free thought, and allowed people to question previously unshaken religious dogmas. The emancipation of the Jews in many European communities, and the Haskalah movement started by Moses Mendelssohn, brought the Enlightenment to the Jewish community.

In response to the challenges of integrating Jewish life with Enlightenment values, German Jews in the early 19th century began to develop the concept of Reform Judaism, adapting Jewish practice to the new conditions of an increasingly urbanized and secular community. Staunch opponents of the Reform movement became known as Orthodox Jews. Later, members of the Reform movement who felt that it was moving away from tradition too quickly formed the Conservative movement.

At the same time, the notion &quot;traditional Judaism&quot; includes the Orthodox with Conservative or solely the Orthodox Jews or exclusively pre-Hasidic pre-modern forms of Orthodoxy.

Over time, three main movements emerged (Orthodox, Reform and Conservative Judaism).

===== Orthodoxy =====
Orthodox Jews generally see themselves as practicing normative Judaism, rather than belonging to a particular movement. Within Orthodox Judaism, there is a spectrum of communities and practices, ranging from ultra-Orthodox Haredi Judaism and Jewish fundamentalism to Modern Orthodox Judaism (with Neo-Orthodoxy, Open Orthodoxy, and Religious Zionism). Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah became known as Haredi Jews (), including , , (), and . Orthodox Jews who were sympathetic to the Haskalah formed what became known as modern/neo-Orthodox Jews. The German rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer is regarded as a Modern Orthodoxy founder, while the father of neo-Orthodoxy was German rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch, who proclaimed principle Torah im Derech Eretz—the strict observance of the Jewish Law in an active social life—in 1851, he become the rabbi of first Orthodox separatist group from Reform community of Frankfurt am Main. In addition, the &quot;Centrist&quot; Orthodoxy was represented by American rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik affiliated with the Orthodox Union.

In Israel, Orthodox Judaism occupies a privileged position: solely an Orthodox rabbi may become the Chief rabbi and Chief military rabbi; and only Orthodox synagogues have the right to conduct Jewish marriages.

===== Reform =====
Reform Judaism, also known as Liberal (the &quot;Liberal&quot; label can refer only to the British branch) or Progressive Judaism, originally began in Germany, the Netherlands and the United States as a reaction to modernity, stresses assimilation and integration with society and a personal interpretation of the Torah. The German rabbi and scholar Abraham Geiger with principles of Judaism as religion and not ethnicity, progressive revelation, historical-critical approach, the centrality of the Prophetic books, and superiority of ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones has become the main ideologist of the &quot;Classical&quot; Reform. Unlike traditional Judaism, the Reform rejects the concept of the Jews as the chosen people. There are transformations from the purism of &quot;Classical&quot; European to the &quot;New Reform&quot; in America with reincorporation some traditional Jewish elements.

In the United States, at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, the Reform movement became the first in terms of numbers, ahead of Conservative Judaism. In contrast, Israeli Reform is smaller one.

===== Conservative (&quot;Masorti&quot;) =====

Conservative or Judaism, originated in Germany in the 19th century on the ideological foundation of the Historical School studies, but became institutionalized in the United States, where it was to become the largest Jewish movement (however, in 1990 Reform Judaism already outpaced Conservatism by 3 percent). After the division between Reform and Orthodox Judaism, the Conservative movement tried to provide Jews seeking liberalization of Orthodox theology and practice, such as female rabbi ordination, with a more traditional and halakhically-based alternative to Reform Judaism. It has spread to Ashkenazi communities in Anglophone countries and Israel.

Neolog Judaism, a movement in the Kingdom of Hungary and in its territories ceded in 1920, is similar to the more traditional branch of American Conservative Judaism.

===== Communal Judaism (&quot;Ḥevrati&quot;) =====

Communal Judaism, also referred to as יהדות חברתי (&quot;Yahadut Ḥevrati&quot;) in Hebrew, is a denomination that intertwines the ethnoreligious identity and indigenous tradition within the broader Jewish community. Unlike other movements which may emphasize theological nuances, Communal Judaism places a substantial focus on the social and communal aspects of Jewish life, alongside personal spiritual practices.

Practitioners are diverse, found globally with significant numbers in Israel and the United States, extending to European and Middle Eastern countries. This spread is reflective of the movement&#x27;s inclusive approach to Jewish identity, welcoming those who align with its core values of maintaining communal traditions and customs without the stringent adherence to rabbinical interpretations that some other denominations might require.

In terms of religious observance, adherents commonly engage in the lighting of Shabbat candles, recitation of Kiddush, and the enjoyment of communal meals replete with traditional &quot;zemirot&quot;. This practice is designed to foster a sense of community and spiritual reflection, particularly on Shabbat where the use of technology is often set aside to maintain a contemplative state.

Dietary laws within Communal Judaism adhere to &quot;kashrut&quot;, the set of Jewish dietary laws, with a focus on traditional observance. This includes abstaining from pork and shellfish and not mixing meat with dairy products, as outlined in the Torah.

The connection to the Land of Israel stands as a central tenet of Communal Judaism, emphasizing a deep ethnic heritage and historical relationship with the land. This connection is celebrated and remembered through the observance of holidays and commemorations that reflect on the Jewish people&#x27;s historical experiences of dispersal and return.

Spiritually, Communal Judaism advocates for the integration of tradition into daily life, upholding a heart-centered approach to religious practice. While individual prayer is encouraged, the emphasis is placed on communal worship and support, reflecting the movement&#x27;s overarching commitment to a life lived in close connection with one&#x27;s community and heritage.

==== Migration ====
The particular forms of Judaism which are practiced by the different Jewish denominations have been shaped by the immigration of the Ashkenazi Jewish communities, once concentrated in eastern and central Europe, to western and mostly Anglophone countries (in particular, in North America). In the middle of the 20th century, the institutional division of North American Jewry between Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox movements still reflected immigrant origins. Reform Jews at that time were predominantly of German or western European origin, while both Conservative and Orthodox Judaism came primarily from eastern European countries.

==== Zionists (&quot;Datim-leumi&quot;) and anti-Zionists ====
The issue of Zionism was once very divisive in the Jewish community. Religious Zionism, a.k.a. &quot;Nationalist Orthodoxy&quot; () combines Zionism and Orthodox Judaism, based on the teachings of rabbis Zvi Hirsch Kalischer and Abraham Isaac Kook. The name or (&quot;Nationalist Haredim&quot;) refers to the Haredi-oriented variety of Religious Zionism. Another mode is Reform Zionism as Zionist arm of Reform Judaism.

Non-Orthodox Conservative leaders joined Zionist mission. Reconstructionist Judaism also supports Zionism and &quot;the modern state of Israel plays a central role in its ideology.&quot;

Religious Zionists (&quot;datim&quot;) have embraced the Zionist movement, including Religious Kibbutz Movement, as part of the divine plan to bring or speed up the messianic era.

Before the creation of the State of Israel or the Holocaust, Zionism was rejected by most ultra-Orthodox and Reform Jews. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish non-Zionists believed that the return to Israel could only happen with the coming of the Messiah, and that a political attempt to re-establish a Jewish state through human means alone was contrary to God&#x27;s plan. Non-Zionists believed that Jews should integrate into the countries in which they lived, rather than moving to the Land of Israel. The original founders of Reform Judaism in Germany rejected traditional prayers for the restoration of Jerusalem. The view among Reform Jews that Judaism was strictly a religion rather than a nation with cultural identity, and that Jews should be assimilated, loyal citizens of their host nations, led to a non-Zionist, and sometimes anti-Zionist, stance. After events of the 20th century, most importantly the Holocaust and the establishment of the modern State of Israel, opposition to Zionism largely disappeared within Reform Judaism.

Among most religious non-Zionists, such as Chabad, there is a de facto recognition of Israel, but only as a secular non-religious state.

A few of the fringe groups of the anti-Zionists, with marginal ideology, does not recognize the legitimacy of the Israeli state. Among them are both the Orthodox (the Satmar Hasidism, Edah HaChareidis, Neturei Karta) and Reform (American Council for Judaism).

In addition, according to some contemporary scholars, Religious Zionism stands at least outside of Rabbinic Judaism or ever shoots off Judaism as such.

==== Pressures of assimilation ====

Among the most striking differences between the Jewish movements in the 21st century is their response to pressures of assimilation, such as intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews. Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis have been most accepting of intermarried couples, with some rabbis willing to officiate in mixed religious ceremonies, although most insist that children in such families be raised strictly Jewish. Conservative rabbis are not permitted to officiate in such marriages, but are supportive of couples when the non-Jewish partner wishes to convert to Judaism and raise children as Jewish.

=== Crypto-Judaism ===

Crypto-Judaism is the secret adherence to Judaism by people who publicly profess another faith; practitioners of Crypto-Judaism are referred to as &quot;crypto-Jews&quot; (origin from Greek kryptos – κρυπτός, &#x27;hidden&#x27;). Nowadays, in whole, Crypto-Judaism movements are a historical phenomenon.

In the United States, Reform rabbi Jacques Cukierkorn is one of the leaders of the outreach to the descendants of those Crypto-Jews who wish to renew their ties with the Jewish people.

The subgroups of Crypto-Jews are as follows:
*Anusim
**Sephardic Bnei Anusim
***Converso
***Marrano
***Xueta
*Beta Abraham
*Chala (Jews)
*Sabbateanism
*Frankism
*Dönmeh
*Kaifeng Jews
*Mashhadi Jews
*Neofiti

=== Other ethnic movements ===
==== Beta Israel (Haymanot) ====
The Beta Israel (House of Israel), also known as Ethiopian Jews, are a Jewish community that developed in Ethiopia and lived there for centuries. Most of the Beta Israel emigrated to Israel in the late 20th century. They practiced Haymanot, a religion which is generally recognized as a non-Rabbinic form of Judaism (in Israel, they practice a mixture of Haymanot and Rabbinic Judaism). To the Beta Israel, the holiest book is the &quot;Orit&quot; (a word which means the &quot;law&quot;), and it consists of the Torah and the Books of Joshua, Judges and Ruth. Until the middle of the 20th century, the Beta Israel of Ethiopia were the only modern Jewish group which practiced a monastic tradition which the monks adhered to by living in monasteries which were separated from the Jewish villages.

==== Crimean Karaites ====

The Crimean Karaites ( Karaims) are an ethnicity which is derived from Turkic Karaim-speaking adherents of Karaite Judaism in Eastern Europe, especially in Crimea. They were probably Jewish by origin, but due to political pressure and other reasons, many of them began to claim that they were Turks, descendants of the Khazars. During the era when Crimea was a part of the Russian Empire, the Crimean Karaite leaders persuaded the Russian rulers to exempt Karaites from the anti-Semitic regulations which were imposed upon Jews. These Karaites were recognized as non-Jews during the Nazi occupation. Some of them even served in the SS. The ideology of de-Judaization and the revival of Tengrism were imbued with the works of the contemporary leaders of the Karaites in Crimea. While the members of several Karaite congregations were registered as Turks, some of them retained Jewish customs. In the 1990s, many Karaites emigrated to Israel, under the Law of Return. The largest Karaite community has since then resided in Israel.

==== Igbo Jews ====
Igbo people of Nigeria who practice a form of Judaism are referred to as Igbo Jews. Judaism has been documented in parts of Nigeria since the precolonial period, from as early as the 1500s, but is not known to have been practiced in the Igbo region in precolonial times. Nowadays, up to 30,000 Igbos are practicing some form of Judaism.

==== Subbotniks ====

The Subbotniks are a movement of Jews of Russian ethnic origin which split off from other Sabbatarians in the late 18th century. The majority of the Subbotniks practiced Rabbinic and Karaite Judaism, a minority of them practiced Spiritual Christianity. Subbotnik families settled in the Holy Land which was then a part of the Ottoman Empire, in the 1880s, as part of the Zionist First Aliyah in order to escape oppression in the Russian Empire and later, most of them married other Jews. Their descendants included Israeli Jews such as Alexander Zaïd, Major-General Alik Ron, and the mother of Ariel Sharon.

== 20th/21st-century movements ==
=== 20th-century movements ===
Additionally, a number of smaller groups have emerged:
; Black Judaism

A type of Judaism that is predominantly practiced in African communities, both inside and outside Africa (such as North America). It is theologically characterized by the selective acceptance of the Judaic faith (in some cases, such selective acceptance has historical circumstances), and the belief system of Black Judaism is significantly different from the belief system of the mainstream movements of Judaism. In addition, although Black Judaic communities adopt Judaic practices such as the celebration of Jewish holidays and the recital of Jewish prayers, some of them are generally not considered legitimate Jews by mainstream Jewish societies.

Rather than a type, Judaism as practiced by the Abayudaya, in eastern Uganda and in Israel, is devout in keeping western halakha, especially as led by the Reform and Conservative movements, with whom most Abayudaya community members in Uganda affiliate. Gershom Sizomu, the spiritual leader of the Abayudaya and Rosh Yeshiva, first native-born black rabbi in sub-Saharan Africa, also the first chief rabbi of Uganda, and since 2016 a Member of Uganda Parliament, is a graduate of the American Jewish University in Los Angeles, California receiving ordination under the auspices of the Conservative movement in 2008. In June 2016, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin led a Beit Din that performed an Orthodox conversion for the Putti community in Uganda.
; Jewish Science
Formed in the early 20th century by Alfred G. Moses and Morris Lichtenstein, Jewish Science was founded as a counterweight Jewish movement to Christian Science. Jewish Science sees God as a force or energy penetrating the reality of the Universe and emphasis is placed upon the role of affirmative prayer in personal healing and spiritual growth. The Society of Jewish Science in New York is the institutional arm of the movement regularly publishing &quot;The Interpreter&quot;, the movement&#x27;s primary literary publication.
; Reconstructionist Judaism

Founded by rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the 1922 American split from Conservative Judaism that views Judaism as a progressively evolving civilization with focus on Jewish community. The central organization is &quot;Reconstructing Judaism&quot;. Assessments of its impact range from being recognized as the 4th major stream of Judaism to described as a smaller movement. As noted, Reconstructionism is a smaller movement, but its ideas significantly impacted Jewish life in the America.
; Humanistic Judaism
A nontheistic worldwide movement that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity. Originated in Detroit in 1963 with the founding figure, Reform rabbi Sherwin Wine, in 1969 was established the Society for Humanistic Judaism.
; Carlebach movement
The neo-Hasidic movement inspired by the counterculture of the 1960s and founded in the late 1960s in San Francisco (where opened the House of Love and Prayer), then in Israel, by a musician, Lubavich&#x27;s Hasidic rabbi Shlomo Carlebach for the return of secular youth to the bosom of Orthodox Judaism. The movement has no organisational agenda and promotes Carlebach minyan, a song-filled form of Jewish worship.
; Jewish Renewal
Partly syncretistic movement founded in the mid-1970s by ex-Lubavich&#x27;s Hasidic rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi and rooted in the counterculture of the 1960s and the Havurat Shalom group. The &quot;Bnei ʻOr&quot; (Songs of Light) in Philadelphia—the first Renewal community—later was established the ambrella organisation &quot;ALEPH: the Alliance for Jewish Renewal&quot;. Its syncretism includes Kabbalah, neo-Hasidism, Reconstructionist Judaism, Western Buddhist meditation, Sufism, New Age, feminism, liberalism, and so on, tends to embrace the ecstatic worship style. Renewal congregations tend to be inclusive on the subject of who is a Jew and had avoided affiliation with any Jewish communities.
; Conservadox
The term is occasionally applied to describe either individuals or new congregations, especially congregations which were established in the US in 1984 by rabbi David Weiss Halivni, such as the Union for Traditional Judaism, located between the Conservative and Modern Orthodox. While most scholars consider &quot;Union for Traditional Judaism&quot; (formerly Union for Traditional Conservative Judaism) as a new movement, some attribute it to the right wing of Conservative Judaism.
; Kabbalah Centre
A &quot;New Age Judaism&quot; worldwide organisation established in 1984 by American rabbi Philip Berg, that popularizes Jewish mysticism among a universal audience.
; Lev Tahor
A Haredi sect formed in the 1980s by Israeli-Canadian rabbi Shlomo Helbrans, follows a strict version of halakha, including its own unique practices such as lengthy prayer sessions, arranged marriages between teenagers, and head-to-toe coverings for females.
; Open Orthodoxy
A movement founded by Avi Weiss in the late 1990s in US, with its own schools for religious ordination, both for men (Yeshivat Chovevei Torah) and women (Yeshivat Maharat). The movement declarates liberal, or inclusive Orthodoxy with women&#x27;s ordination, full accepting LGBT members, and reducing stringent rules for conversion.
; Haredi burqa sect 
A controversial ultra-Orthodox group with a Jewish burqa-style covering of a woman&#x27;s entire body, including a veil covering the face. Also known as the &quot;Taliban Women&quot; and the &quot;Taliban Mothers&quot; (נשות הטאליבן).
; Messianic Judaism

Made up of followers who seek to combine parts of Rabbinic Judaism with a belief in Jesus as the Messiah and other Jewish Christian and western Christian beliefs. It is not regarded as Judaism by the major movements of Judaism, and it is considered a form of Protestant Christianity. People who had become Messianic Jews as, in fact, Christians were not therefore eligible for Aliyah under the Law of Return. &quot;Scholars are divided as to whether to call Messianic Judaism a Christian or Jewish Sect.&quot;

Remark: Baal teshuva movement—a description of the return of secular Jews to religious Judaism and involved with all the Jewish movements.

=== Trans- and post-denominational Judaism ===
Already in the 1980s, 20–30 percent of members of the largest American Jewish communities, such as of New York City or Miami, rejected a denominational label. And &quot;Israeli Democracy Index&quot; commissioned in 2013 by the Israel Democracy Institute found that the two thirds of respondents said they felt no connection to any denomination, or declined to respond.

The very idea of Jewish denominationalism is contested by some Jews and Jewish non-denominational organisations, which consider themselves to be &quot;trans-denominational&quot; or &quot;post-denominational&quot;. The term &quot;trans-denominational&quot; also applied to describe new movements located on the religious continuum between some major streams, as an instance, Conservadox (Union for Traditional Judaism).

A variety of new Jewish organisations are emerging that lack such affiliations:
* Havurah movement is the number of small egalitarian experimental spiritual groups (first in 1960 in California) for prayer as autonomous alternatives to Jewish movements. Most notable of them is the Havurat Shalom in Somerville, Massachusetts;
* Independent minyan movement is a lay-led Jewish worship and study community that has developed independently of established denominational and synagogue structures and combines halakha with egalitarianism;
* International Federation of Rabbis (IFR), a non-denominational rabbinical organization for rabbis of all movements and backgrounds;
* Some Jewish day schools lack affiliation with any one movement;
* There are several seminaries which are not controlled by a denomination (see and ): 
** Academy for Jewish Religion (California) (AJRCA) is a transdenominational seminary based in Los Angeles, California. It draws faculty and leadership from all denominations of Judaism. It has programs for rabbis, cantors, chaplains, community leadership and Clinical Pastoral Education (CPE); 
** Academy for Jewish Religion (New York) (AJR) is a transdenominational seminary in Yonkers, NY, that trains rabbis and cantors and also offers Master&#x27;s Program in Jewish Studies; 
** Hebrew College, a seminary in Newton Centre, Massachusetts, near Boston;
** Hebrew Seminary in Skokie, Illinois 
** Other smaller, less traditional institutions include: 
***Rabbinical Seminary International, Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute, Pluralistic Rabbinical Seminary, Rimmon Rabbinical School
***Mesifta Adath Wolkowisk aimed at community professionals with significant knowledge and experience.

Organizations such as these believe that the formal divisions that have arisen among the &quot;denominations&quot; in contemporary Jewish history are unnecessarily divisive, as well as religiously and intellectually simplistic. According to Rachel Rosenthal, &quot;the post-denominational Jew refuses to be labeled or categorized in a religion that thrives on stereotypes. He has seen what the institutional branches of Judaism have to offer and believes that a better Judaism can be created.&quot; Such Jews might, out of necessity, affiliate with a synagogue associated with a particular movement, but their own personal Jewish ideology is often shaped by a variety of influences from more than one denomination.

=== Bnei Noah ===

Noahidism, Noahides, or Bnei Noah (, &quot;Sons of Noah&quot;) is a new religious movement which is based upon the Seven Laws of Noah. Historically, the Hebrew term &quot;Bnei Noah&quot; has been applied to all non-Jews because Jews believe that they are the descendants of Noah. Nowadays, however, it is specifically used to refer to those &quot;Righteous Gentiles&quot; who observe the Seven Laws of Noah. According to Jewish law, non-Jews (Gentiles) are not obligated to convert to Judaism, but they are required to observe the Seven Laws of Noah in order to be assured that they will have a place in the World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba), the final reward of the righteous. The modern Noahide movement was founded in the 1990s by Orthodox rabbis from Israel (mainly tied Hasidic and Zionist).

<text>Vasili Nikitich Mitrokhin (; March 3, 1922 – January 23, 2004) was an archivist for the Soviet Union&#x27;s foreign intelligence service, the First Chief Directorate of the KGB, who defected to the United Kingdom in 1992. Mitrokhin first offered his material to the US&#x27; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Latvia but they rejected it as possible fakes. After that, he resorted to the UK&#x27;s MI6 which arranged his defection from Russia. These notes became known as the Mitrokhin Archives.

He was co-author with Christopher Andrew of &quot;The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West&quot;, a massive account of Soviet intelligence operations based on copies of material from the archive. The second volume, &quot;The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB in the World&quot;, was published in 2005, soon after Mitrokhin&#x27;s death.

==Education==
Mitrokhin was born in Yurasovo, in Central Russia, Ryazan Oblast, Russian SFSR. After leaving school, he entered artillery school, then attended university in Kazakh SSR, graduating with degrees in history and law.

==Career==

===Military===
Towards the end of the second World War, Mitrokhin took a job in prosecutor&#x27;s office in Kharkiv in the Ukrainian SSR. He entered the MGB as a foreign intelligence officer in 1948. His first foreign posting was in 1952.

During the 1950s, he served on various undercover assignments overseas. In 1956, for example, he accompanied the Soviet team to the Olympic Games in Australia. Later that year, however, after he had apparently mishandled an operational assignment, he was moved from operational duties to the archives of the KGB&#x27;s First Chief Directorate and told he would never work in the field again.

===Disillusionment===
Mitrokhin sometimes dated the beginnings of his disillusionment to Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s famous speech to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union congress denouncing Joseph Stalin, though it seems he may have been harbouring doubts for some time before that. For years, he had listened to broadcasts on the BBC and Voice of America, noting the gulf between their reports and party propaganda.

However, when he began looking into the archives, he claimed to have been shocked by what he discovered about the KGB&#x27;s systematic repression of the Soviet people. &quot;I could not believe such evil&quot;, he recalled. &quot;It was all planned, prepared, thought out in advance. It was a terrible shock when I read things.&quot;

Between 1972 and 1984, he supervised the move of the archive of the First Chief Directorate from the Lubyanka to the new KGB headquarters at Yasenevo. While doing so, he made handwritten copies and immensely detailed notes of documents from the archive. He retired in 1985.

===Defection===
During the Soviet era, Mitrokhin made no attempts to contact any Western intelligence services. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, he traveled to Latvia with copies of material from the archive and walked into the American embassy in Riga. Central Intelligence Agency officers there did not consider him to be credible, concluding that the copied documents could have been faked.

He then went to the British embassy and a young diplomat there saw his potential. Following a further meeting one month later with representatives of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), operations retrieved the 25,000 pages of files hidden in his house, covering operations from as far back as the 1930s. He and his family were then exfiltrated to the United Kingdom, even though authorities of Yeltsin&#x27;s Russia were not impeding the free travel abroad of active or retired members of secret services or members of their families. Richard Tomlinson, the MI6 officer imprisoned in 1997 for attempting to publish a book about his career, was one of those involved in retrieving the documents from containers hidden under the floor of the dacha. The notes given by Mitrokhin to the MI6 revealed exposures about some unknown number of Soviet agents, including Melita Norwood. However, Norwood was not charged with an offence.

==Mitrokhin Archive==

These handwritten notes of Mitrokhin are collectively referred to as the Mitrokhin Archives.

<text>Andrei Andreyevich Gromyko (; ; – 2 July 1989) was a Soviet politician and diplomat during the Cold War. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs (1957–1985) and as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (1985–1988). Gromyko was responsible for many top decisions on Soviet foreign policy until he retired in 1988. In the 1940s, Western pundits called him &quot;Mr. Nyet&quot; (&quot;Mr. No&quot;), or &quot;Grim Grom&quot;, because of his frequent use of the Soviet veto in the United Nations Security Council.

Gromyko&#x27;s political career started in 1939 in the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (renamed Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1946). He became the Soviet ambassador to the United States in 1943, leaving that position in 1946 to become the Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York. Upon his return to Moscow he became a Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and later First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He went on to become the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1952.

As Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, Gromyko was directly involved in deliberations with the Americans during the Cuban Missile Crisis and helped broker a peace treaty ending the 1965 Indo-Pakistani War. Under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev, he played a central role in the establishment of détente with the United States by negotiating the ABM Treaty, the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the SALT I &amp; II, among others. When Brezhnev suffered a stroke in 1975 impairing his ability to govern, Gromyko effectively dictated policymaking alongside KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov, Defense Minister Andrei Grechko and Grechko&#x27;s successor, Marshal Dmitry Ustinov. Even after Brezhnev&#x27;s death, Gromyko&#x27;s rigid conservatism and distrust of the West continued to dominate the Soviet Union&#x27;s foreign policy until Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s rise to power in 1985.

Following Gorbachev&#x27;s election as General Secretary, Gromyko lost his office as foreign minister and was appointed to the largely ceremonial post of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Subsequently, he retired from political life in 1988, and died the following year in Moscow.

==Early life==

===Background and youth===
Gromyko was born to a poor &quot;semi-peasant, semi-worker&quot; Belarusian family in the Belarusian village of Staryye Gromyki, near Gomel, on 18 July 1909. Gromyko&#x27;s father, Andrei Matveyevich, worked as a seasonal worker in a local factory. Andrei Matveyevich was not a very educated man, having only attended four years of school, but knew how to read and write. He had fought in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Gromyko&#x27;s mother, Olga Yevgenyevna, came from a poor peasant family in the neighbouring city of Zhelezniki. She attended school only for a short period of time as, when her father died, she left to help her mother with the harvest.

Gromyko grew up near the district town of Vetka where most of the inhabitants were devoted Old Believers in the Russian Orthodox Church. Gromyko&#x27;s own village was also predominantly religious, but Gromyko started doubting the supernatural at a very early age. His first dialog on the subject was with his grandmother Marfa, who answered his inquiry about God with &quot;Wait until you get older. Then you will understand all this much better&quot;. According to Gromyko, &quot;Other adults said basically the same thing&quot; when talking about religion. Gromyko&#x27;s neighbour at the time, Mikhail Sjeljutov, was a freethinker and introduced Gromyko to new non-religious ideas and told Gromyko that scientists were beginning to doubt the existence of God. From the age of nine, after the Bolshevik revolution, Gromyko started reading atheist propaganda in flyers and pamphlets. At the age of thirteen Gromyko became a member of the Komsomol and held anti-religious speeches in the village with his friends as well as promoting Communist values.

The news that Germany had attacked the Russian Empire in August 1914 came without warning to the local population. This was the first time, as Gromyko notes, that he felt &quot;love for his country&quot;. His father, Andrei Matveyevich, was again conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army and served for three years on the southwestern front, under the leadership of General Aleksei Brusilov. Andrei Matveyevich returned home on the eve of the 1917 October Revolution in Russia.

Gromyko was elected First Secretary of the local Komsomol chapter at the beginning of 1923. Following Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924, the villagers asked Gromyko what would happen in the leader&#x27;s absence. Gromyko remembered a communist slogan from the heyday of the October Revolution: &quot;The revolution was carried through by Lenin and his &quot;helpers&quot;.&quot; He then told the villagers that Lenin was dead but &quot;his aides, the Party, still lived on.&quot;

===Education and party membership===
When he was young, Gromyko&#x27;s mother Olga told him that he should leave his home town to become an educated man. Gromyko followed his mother&#x27;s advice and, after finishing seven years of primary school and vocational education in Gomel, he moved to Borisov to attend technical school. Gromyko became a member of the All-Union Communist Party Bolsheviks in 1931, something he had dreamed of since he learned about the &quot;difference between a poor farmer and a landowner, a worker and a capitalist&quot;. Gromyko was voted in as secretary of his party cell at his first party conference and used most of his weekends doing volunteer work. Gromyko received a very small stipend to live on, but still had a strong nostalgia for the days when he worked as a volunteer. It was about this time that Gromyko met his future wife, Lydia Grinevich. Grinevich was the daughter of a Belarusian peasant family and came from Kamenki, a small village to the west of Minsk. She and Gromyko had two children, Anatoly and Emiliya.

After studying in Borisov for two years, Gromyko was appointed principal of a secondary school in Dzyarzhynsk, where he taught, supervised the school, and continued his studies. One day, a representative from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Byelorussia offered him an opportunity to do post-graduate work in Minsk. Gromyko traveled to Minsk for an interview with the head of the university, I.M. Borisevich, who explained that a new post-graduate program had been formed for training in economics; Gromyko&#x27;s record in education and social work made him a desirable candidate. Gromyko advised Borisevich that he would have difficulty living on a meager student stipend. Borisevich assured him that on finishing the program, his salary would be at the party&#x27;s top pay grade – &quot;a decent living wage&quot;. Gromyko accepted the offer, moving his family to Minsk in 1933. Gromyko and the other post-graduates were invited to an anniversary reception at which, as recounted in Gromyko&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs&quot;:

We were amazed to find ourselves treated as equals and placed at their table to enjoy what for us was a sumptuous feast. We realised then that not for nothing did the Soviet state treat its scientists well: evidently science and those who worked in it were highly regarded by the state.

After that day of pleasantry, Gromyko for the first time in his life wanted to enter higher education, but without warning, Gromyko and his family were moved in 1934 to Moscow, settling in the northeastern Alexeyevsky District. In 1936, after another three years of studying economics, Gromyko became a researcher and lecturer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. His area of expertise was the US economy, and he published several books on the subject. Gromyko assumed his new job would be a permanent one, but in 1939 he was called upon by a Central Committee Commission which selected new personnel to work in diplomacy. (The Great Purge of 1938 opened many positions in the diplomatic corps.) Gromyko recognised such familiar faces as Vyacheslav Molotov and Georgy Malenkov. A couple of days later he was transferred from the Academy of Sciences to the diplomatic service.

===Ambassador and World War II===

In early 1939, Gromyko started working for the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in Moscow. He became the Head of the Department of Americas, and because of his position Gromyko met with United States ambassador to the Soviet Union Lawrence Steinhardt. Gromyko believed Steinhardt to be &quot;totally uninterested in creating good relations between the US and the USSR&quot; and that Steinhardt&#x27;s predecessor Joseph Davies was more &quot;colourful&quot; and seemed &quot;genuinely interested&quot; in improving the relations between the two countries. Davies received the Order of Lenin for his work in trying to improve diplomatic relations between the US and the USSR. After heading the Americas department for 6 months, Gromyko was called upon by Joseph Stalin. Stalin started the conversation by telling Gromyko that he would be sent to the Soviet embassy in the United States to become second-in-command. &quot;The Soviet Union,&quot; Stalin said, &quot;should maintain reasonable relations with such a powerful country like the United States, especially in light of the growing fascist threat&quot;. Vyacheslav Molotov contributed with some minor modifications but mostly agreed with what Stalin had said. &quot;How are your English skills improving?,&quot; Stalin asked; &quot;Comrade Gromyko, you should pay a visit or two to an American church and listen to their sermons. Priests usually speak correct English with good accents. Do you know that the Russian revolutionaries, when they were abroad, always followed this practice to improve their skills in foreign languages?&quot; Gromyko was quite amazed about what Stalin had just told him but he never visited an American church.

Gromyko had never been abroad before and, to get to the United States, he had to travel via airplane through Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to Genoa, Italy, where he boarded a ship to the United States. He later wrote in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; that New York City was a good example on how humans, by the &quot;means of wealth and technology are able to create something that is totally alien to our nature&quot;. He further noticed the New York working districts which, in his own opinion, were proof of the inhumanity of capitalism and of the system&#x27;s greed. Gromyko met and consulted with most of the senior officers of the United States government during his first days and succeeded Maxim Litvinov as ambassador to the United States in 1943. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot; Gromyko wrote fondly of President Franklin D. Roosevelt even though he believed him to be a representative of the bourgeoisie class. During his time as ambassador, Gromyko met prominent personalities such as British actor Charlie Chaplin, and British economist John Maynard Keynes.

Gromyko was a Soviet delegate to the Tehran, Dumbarton Oaks, Yalta and Potsdam conferences. In 1943, the same year as the Tehran Conference, the USSR established diplomatic relations with Cuba and Gromyko was appointed the Soviet ambassador to Havana. Gromyko claimed that the accusations brought against Roosevelt by American right-wingers, that he was a socialist sympathizer, were absurd. While he started out as a member delegate Gromyko later became the head of the Soviet delegation to the San Francisco conference after Molotov&#x27;s departure. When he later returned to Moscow to celebrate the Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War, Stalin commended him saying a good diplomat was &quot;worth two or three armies at the front&quot;.

==At the helm of Soviet foreign policy==

===United Nations===
Gromyko was appointed Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations (UN) in April 1946. The USSR supported the election of the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, a former Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, in the opinion of Gromyko, Lie became an active supporter of the &quot;expansionist behaviour&quot; of the United States and its &quot;American aggressionist&quot; policy. Because of this political stance, Gromyko believed Lie to be a poor Secretary-General. Trygve&#x27;s successor, Swede Dag Hammarskjöld also promoted what Gromyko claimed as &quot;anti-Soviet policies&quot;. U Thant, the third Secretary-General, once told Gromyko that it was &quot;close to impossible&quot; to have an &quot;objective opinion of the USSR&quot; in the Secretariat of the United Nations because the majority of Secretariat members were of American nationality, or &quot;supporters of the United States&quot;.

Gromyko often used the Soviet veto power in the early days of the United Nations. So familiar was a Soviet veto in the early days of the UN that Gromyko became known as &quot;Mr Nyet&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Mr No&quot;. During the first 10 years of the UN, the Soviet Union used its veto 79 times. In the same period, the Republic of China used the veto once, France twice and the others not at all. On 14 May 1947, Gromyko advocated the one-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and the two-state solution as the second best option in the case that &quot;relations between the Jewish and Arab populations of Palestine ... proved to be so bad that it would be impossible to reconcile them&quot;.

===Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom===
Gromyko was appointed Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom at a June 1952 meeting with Joseph Stalin in the Kremlin. Stalin paced back and forth as normal, telling Gromyko about the importance of his new office, and saying &quot;The United Kingdom now has the opportunity to play a greater role in international politics. But it is not clear in which direction the British government with their great diplomatic experience will steer their efforts [...] This is why we need people who understand their way of thinking&quot;. Gromyko met with Winston Churchill in 1952 not to talk about current politics but nostalgically about World War II. Gromyko met Churchill again in 1953 to talk about their experiences during World War II before returning to Russia when he was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.

===Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union===

During his initial days as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Andrei Gromyko devoted most of his time battling the International Department (ID) of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union under Boris Ponomarev. Ponomarev advocated an expanded role for the ID in Soviet foreign relations but Gromyko flatly refused. A top Soviet official, Valentin Falin, said the ID &quot;interfered in the activities&quot; of Gromyko and his ministry countless times. Gromyko disliked both Ponomarev and the power sharing between the ID and the foreign ministry. However, even in the midst of such political infighting, Gromyko presided over many key junctures in the Soviet Union&#x27;s diplomacy throughout his tenure as Foreign Minister.

One of his first tests as his country&#x27;s chief diplomat came in 1958 when he addressed Mao Zedong&#x27;s request for the Soviet Union to back his planned war with the Republic of China. During their discussions, Mao flabbergasted Gromyko by telling him that he was willing to sacrifice the lives of &quot;300 million people&quot; to bring about the Republic of China&#x27;s annexation. Gromyko affirmed to Mao that his proposal would never get the approval of the Soviet leadership. Upon learning of this discussion, Moscow terminated the Soviet-Chinese nuclear program along with various industrialization projects in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
Years later during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Gromyko met U.S. President John F. Kennedy while acting under instructions from the current Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, Gromyko wrote that Kennedy seemed &quot;out of touch&quot; when he first met him, and was more &quot;ideologically driven&quot; than &quot;practical&quot;. In a 1988 interview, he further described Kennedy as nervous and prone to making contradictory statements involving American intentions towards Cuba.

Gromyko, in addition to John F. Kennedy, held important political discussions with Dean Rusk, a former United States Secretary of State, in regards to the Cuban Missile Crisis. He defended his state&#x27;s actions, stating that the Soviet Union had every right to be present in Cuba, especially considering the fact that the United States had established their own missiles in Turkey. To Gromyko it seemed ironic the Soviet Union was blamed for their presence in Cuba, yet America had established countless of foreign military bases worldwide. After several negotiations, Gromyko mentioned: &quot;By Rusk&#x27;s behavior it was possible to observe how painfully the American leaders are suffering the fact that the Soviet Union decisively has stood on the side of Cuba&quot;, showing Rusk&#x27;s &quot;weak character&quot;.
Later, under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev, Gromyko played a key role in the establishment of détente, a new phase of Soviet–American relations characterized by a significant reduction of tensions which lasted until 1979. In furtherance of this new arrangement, he oversaw the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 1 July 1968, the ABM and SALT I treaties in 1972, and the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War in 1973. During his 28 years as Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko supported the policy of disarmament, stating in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; that &quot;Disarmament is the ideal of Socialism&quot;.
Throughout his career, Gromyko explicitly promoted the idea that no important international agreement could be reached without the Soviet Union&#x27;s involvement. Towards this end, one accomplishment he took particular pride in was the signing of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty whose negotiation could be traced back to 1958. Additionally, in 1966, Gromyko and Alexei Kosygin persuaded both Pakistan and India to sign the Tashkent Declaration, a peace treaty in the aftermath of the Indo-Pakistan war of 1965. Later in the same year, he engaged in a dialogue with Pope Paul VI, as part of the pontiff&#x27;s ostpolitik that resulted in greater openness for the Roman Catholic Church in Eastern Europe despite heavy persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union itself.

In 1973, Gromyko was promoted to a full voting member of the Politburo, the Soviet Union&#x27;s highest decision-making body. According to Christian Schmidt-Häuer, upon Gromyko reaching the peak of his power and influence, his approach to diplomacy began to suffer from the same qualities that underpinned his early career -his &quot;exceptional memory and confidence in his experience&quot; now made him inflexible, unimaginative and &quot;devoid of a long-term vision&quot; for the USSR. By the time Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko rose to the Soviet leadership, Gromyko frequently found himself advocating a harder line than his superiors.
When Brezhnev&#x27;s ability to govern was impaired following a stroke in 1975, Gromyko effectively dominated Soviet policymaking alongside KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov, Defense Minister Andrei Grechko, and Grechko&#x27;s successor, Marshal Dmitry Ustinov, for the rest of Brezhnev&#x27;s rule. After Brezhnev&#x27;s death in 1982, Andropov was voted in as General Secretary by the Politburo. Immediately after his appointment, Andropov asked Gromyko if he wanted to take over Brezhnev&#x27;s old office of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. However, Gromyko turned down Andropov&#x27;s offer, believing Andropov would eventually take the office for himself.

Ever since being appointed Foreign Minister in February 1957, Gromyko never challenged the authority of those chosen to lead the Soviet Union by the Central Committee. However, this changed when the ailing Konstantin Chernenko rose to become the country&#x27;s de jure ruler. Unimpressed by the new leader&#x27;s feeble grasp of foreign relations and weak standing in the Politburo, Gromyko aggressively asserted control over Soviet diplomacy to the point of regularly interrupting and contradicting Chernenko in front of other world leaders. Thus, despite Chernenko&#x27;s interest in reviving détente, the longtime Foreign Minister&#x27;s distrust of &quot;the West&quot; meant there was no attempt to return to such a policy.

After Chernenko&#x27;s death in 1985, Gromyko nominated Mikhail Gorbachev for the General Secretary on 11 March 1985. In supporting Gorbachev, Gromyko knew that the influence he carried would be strong. Upon being elected, Gorbachev relieved Gromyko as foreign minister and replaced him with Eduard Shevardnadze. Subsequently, he was appointed to the largely honorary position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.

==Head of state, retirement and death==

Gromyko held the office of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet; although de jure he was head of state, in practice this was a largely ceremonial role and his influence in ruling circles diminished. A number of First World journalists believed Gromyko was uncomfortable with many of Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms, however, in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; Gromyko wrote fondly of Gorbachev and the policy of perestroika. Gromyko believed that perestroika was about working for the construction of a socialist society and saw glasnost and perestroika as an attempt at making the USSR more democratic.

During a party conference in July 1988, Vladimir Melnikov called for Gromyko&#x27;s resignation. Melnikov blamed Brezhnev for the economic and political stagnation that had hit the Soviet Union, seeing that Gromyko, as a prominent member of the Brezhnev leadership, was one of the men who had led the USSR into the crisis. Gromyko was promptly defended as &quot;a man respected by the people&quot; in a note by an anonymous delegate. After discussing it with his wife Gromyko decided to leave Soviet politics for good. Gromyko recounts in his &quot;Memoirs&quot; that before he made it official he told Gorbachev that he wished to resign. The following day, 1 October 1988, Gromyko sat beside Gorbachev, Yegor Ligachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov in the Supreme Soviet to make his resignation official:

Such moments in life are just as memorable as when one is appointed to prominent positions. When my comrades took farewell to me, I was equally moved as I had ever been when I was given an important office. What I thought most about was that I had finished my duties towards the people, the Party and the state. This memory is very precious to me.

Gorbachev succeeded Gromyko in office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. After his resignation Gorbachev praised Gromyko for his half-century of service to USSR. Critics, such as Alexander Belonogov, the Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations, claimed Gromyko&#x27;s foreign policy was permeated with &quot;a spirit of intolerance and confrontation&quot;.

After retiring from active politics in 1989 Gromyko started working on his memoirs. Gromyko died on 2 July 1989, just 16 days before what would have been his 80th birthday, after being hospitalised for a vascular problem that was not further identified. His death was followed by a minute of silence at the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies to commemorate him. The Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS), the central news organ in the USSR, called him one of the country&#x27;s most &quot;prominent leaders&quot;. President of the United States George H. W. Bush sent his condolences to Gromyko&#x27;s son, Anatoly. Gromyko was offered a grave in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis, but at the request of his family he was not buried near the Moscow Kremlin Wall but instead at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Gromyko met his wife, Lydia (1911–2004) in Minsk where they were both studying agriculture at the Minsk Institute of Agricultural Science. They married in 1931. They had two children: a son, Anatoly, and a daughter, Emilia. Anatoly (1932–2017) served as a diplomat and was an academic.

==Legacy==

Having been a person of considerable stature during his life, Gromyko held an unusual combination of personal characteristics. Some were impressed by his diplomatic skills, while others called Gromyko mundane and boring. An article written in 1981 in &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;He is one of the most active and efficient members of the Soviet leadership. A man with an excellent memory, a keen intellect and extraordinary endurance [...] Maybe Andrey is the most informed Minister for Foreign affairs in the world&quot;. Gromyko&#x27;s dour demeanor was shown clearly during his first term in Washington and echoed throughout his tenure as Soviet foreign minister. Ambassador Charles W. Yost, who worked with Gromyko at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, the UN founding conference, and at the United Nations, recalled that the &quot;humorless&quot; Soviet ambassador &quot;looked as though he was sucking a lemon.&quot;
There is a story that Gromyko was leaving a Washington hotel one morning and was asked by a reporter; &quot;Minister Gromyko, did you enjoy your breakfast today?&quot; His response was &quot;Perhaps.&quot;

During his twenty-eight years as minister of foreign affairs Gromyko became renowned by his peers for being consumed by his work. Henry Kissinger once said &quot;If you can face Gromyko for one hour and survive, then you can begin to call yourself a diplomat&quot;. Gromyko&#x27;s work influenced Soviet and Russian ambassadors such as Anatoly Dobrynin. Historians Gregory Elliot and Moshe Lewin described Gromyko&#x27;s main characteristic as his &quot;complete identification with the interest of the state and his faithful service to it&quot;, helping to explain his so-called &quot;boring&quot; personality and the mastery of his own ego. West German politician Egon Bahr, when commenting on Gromyko&#x27;s memoirs, said;

He has concealed a veritable treasure-trove from future generations and taken to the grave with him an inestimable knowledge of international connection between the historical events and major figures of his time, which only he could offer. What a pity that this very man proved incapable to the very end of evoking his experience. As a faithful servant of the state, he believed that he should restrict himself to a sober, concise presentation of the bare essentials.

On 18 July 2009, the Republic Belarus ruled by Alexander Lukashenko marked the 100th anniversary of Gromyko&#x27;s birth with nationwide celebrations. In the city of his birth many people laid flowers in front of his bust. A ceremony was held attended by his son and daughter, Anatoly and Emiliya. Several exhibitions were opened and dedicated to his honour and a school and a street in Gomel were renamed in honour of him.

<text>Congress Poland or Congress Kingdom of Poland, formally known as the Kingdom of Poland, was a polity created in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna as a semi-autonomous Polish state, a successor to Napoleon&#x27;s Duchy of Warsaw. It was established when the French ceded a part of Polish territory to the Russian Empire following France&#x27;s defeat in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1915, during World War I, it was replaced by the German-controlled nominal Regency Kingdom until Poland regained independence in 1918.

Following the partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century, Poland ceased to exist as an independent nation for 123 years. The territory, with its native population, was split among the Habsburg monarchy, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Russian Empire. After 1804, an equivalent to Congress Poland within the Austrian Empire was the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also commonly referred to as &quot;Austrian Poland&quot;. The area incorporated into Prussia initially also held autonomy as the Grand Duchy of Posen outside of German Confederation, but later was demoted to merely a Prussian province (the Province of Posen), and was subsequently annexed in 1866 into the North German Confederation, the predecessor of the German Empire.

The Congress Kingdom of Poland was theoretically granted considerable political autonomy by the liberal constitution. However, its rulers, the Russian emperors, generally disregarded any restrictions on their power. It was, therefore, little more than a puppet state in a personal union with the Russian Empire. The autonomy was severely curtailed following uprisings in 1830–31 and 1863, as the country became governed by viceroys, and later divided into governorates (provinces). Thus, from the start, Polish autonomy remained little more than fiction.

The capital was located in Warsaw, which towards the beginning of the 20th century became the Russian Empire&#x27;s third-largest city after St. Petersburg and Moscow. The moderately multicultural population of Congress Poland was estimated at 9,402,253 inhabitants in 1897. It was mostly composed of Poles, Polish Jews, ethnic Germans, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, and a small Russian minority. The predominant religion was Roman Catholicism and the official language used within the state was Polish until the failed January Uprising (1863) when Russian became co-official as a consequence. Yiddish and German were widely spoken by their native speakers.

The territory of Congress Poland roughly corresponds to modern-day Kalisz Region and the Lublin, Łódź, Masovian, Podlaskie and Holy Cross Voivodeships of Poland as well as southwestern Lithuania and a small part of the Grodno District of Belarus.

The Kingdom of Poland effectively came to an end with the Great Retreat of Russian forces in 1915 and was succeeded by the Government General of Warsaw, established by the Germans. In 1917, part of this was renamed as the short-lived Kingdom of Poland, a client state of the Central Powers, which had a Regency Council instead of a king.

==Naming==
Although the official name of the state was the &quot;Kingdom of Poland&quot; (; ), in order to distinguish it from other Kingdoms of Poland, it is often referred to as &quot;Congress Poland&quot;.

==History==
The Congress Kingdom of Poland was created out of the Duchy of Warsaw, a French client state, at the Congress of Vienna in 1815 when the great powers reorganized Europe following the Napoleonic wars. The kingdom was created from parts of the Polish territory that had been partitioned between Austria and Prussia which had been transformed into the Duchy of Warsaw by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1807. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the fate of the Duchy of Warsaw was dependent on Russia. Prussia insisted on the duchy being completely eliminated. Tsar Alexander I intended to annex the duchy and parts of Lithuanian lands which were historically in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Both Austria and the United Kingdom, however, disapproved strongly of the idea, Austria issuing a memorandum on returning to the 1795 resolutions with support from the United Kingdom under George IV, Prime Minister Robert Jenkinson and the British delegate to the Congress, Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh.

Following the Congress, Russia gained a larger share of Poland (with Warsaw) and, after crushing an insurrection in 1831, the Congress Kingdom&#x27;s autonomy was abolished. Poles faced confiscation of property, deportation, forced military service, and the closure of their own universities. The Congress was important enough in the creation of the state to cause the new country to be informally named for it. The kingdom lost its status as a sovereign state in 1831 and the administrative divisions were reorganized. It was sufficiently distinct that its name remained in official Russian use, although in the later years of Russian rule it was replaced with the &quot;Vistula Land&quot; (Russian: Привислинский Край). Following the defeat of the November Uprising its separate institutions and administrative arrangements were abolished as part of increased Russification to be more closely integrated with the Russian Empire. However, even after this formalized annexation, the territory retained some degree of distinctiveness and continued to be referred to informally as Congress Poland until the Russian rule there ended as a result of the advance by the armies of the Central Powers in 1915 during World War I.

The kingdom was 128,500 km2 in area and originally had a population of approximately 3.3 million. The new state would be one of the smallest Polish states ever, smaller than the preceding Duchy of Warsaw and much smaller than the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth which had a population of over 10 million and an area of 1 million km2. Its population reached 6.1 million by 1870 and 10 million by 1900. The majority of ethnic Poles within the Russian Empire lived in the Congress Kingdom, although some areas outside its borders were also inhabited by strong Polish and Roman Catholic minorities.

The Kingdom of Poland largely re-emerged as a result of the efforts of Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, a Pole who aimed to resurrect the Polish state in alliance with Russia. The Kingdom of Poland was one of the few contemporary constitutional monarchies in Europe, with the emperor of Russia serving as the self-proclaimed king of Poland.

===Initial independence===
Theoretically, the Polish Kingdom in its 1815 form was a semi-autonomous state in personal union with Russia through the rule of the Russian emperor. The state possessed the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland, one of the most liberal in 19th-century Europe, a Sejm (parliament) responsible to the king capable of voting laws, an independent army, currency, budget, penal code and a customs boundary separating it from the rest of Russian lands. Poland also had democratic traditions (Golden Liberty) and the Polish nobility deeply valued personal freedom. In reality, the kings had absolute power and the formal title of &quot;Autocrat&quot;, and wanted no restrictions on their rule. All opposition to the emperor of Russia was suppressed and the law was disregarded at will by Russian officials. Though the absolute rule demanded by Russia was difficult to establish due to Poland&#x27;s liberal traditions and institutions, the independence of the kingdom lasted only 15 years; initially Alexander I used the title King of Poland and was obligated to observe the provisions of the constitution. However, in time the situation changed and he granted the viceroy, Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich, almost dictatorial powers. Very soon after Congress of Vienna resolutions were signed, Russia ceased to respect them. In 1819, Alexander I abolished freedom of the press and introduced preventive censorship. Resistance to Russian control began in the 1820s. Russian secret police commanded by Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev started the persecution of Polish secret organizations and in 1821 the King ordered the abolition of Freemasonry, which represented Poland&#x27;s patriotic traditions. Beginning in 1825, the sessions of the Sejm were held in secret.

===Uprisings and loss of autonomy===

Alexander I&#x27;s successor, Nicholas I was crowned King of Poland on 24 May 1829 in Warsaw, but he declined to swear to abide by the Constitution and continued to limit the independence of the Polish kingdom. Nicholas&#x27; rule promoted the idea of Official Nationality, consisting of Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality. In relation to Poles, those ideas meant assimilation: turning them into loyal subjects through gradual religious and cultural conversion. The principle of Orthodoxy was the result of the special role it played in the Russian Empire, as the Church was in fact becoming a department of state, and other religions discriminated against; for instance, papal bulls could not be read in the largely Catholic kingdom of Poland without agreement from the Russian government.

The rule of Nicholas also meant the end of political traditions in Poland; democratic institutions were removed, an appointed—rather than elected—centralized administration was put in place, and efforts were made to change the relations between the state and the individual. All of this led to discontent and resistance among the Polish population. In January 1831, the Sejm deposed Nicholas I as King of Poland in response to his repeated curtailing of its constitutional rights. Nicholas reacted by sending Russian troops into Poland, resulting in the November Uprising.

Following an 11-month military campaign, the Kingdom of Poland lost its semi-independent status and was integrated much more closely with the Russian Empire. This was formalized through the issuing of the Organic Statute of the Kingdom of Poland by the Emperor in 1832, which abolished the constitution, army and legislative assembly. Over the next 30 years, a series of measures bound Congress Poland ever more closely to Russia. In 1863 the January Uprising broke out but lasted only two years before being crushed. As a direct result, any remaining separate status of the kingdom was removed and the political entity was directly incorporated into the Russian Empire. The unofficial name &quot;Privislinsky Krai&quot; (), i.e., &#x27;Vistula Land&#x27;, replaced &#x27;Kingdom of Poland&#x27; as the area&#x27;s official name and the area became a &quot;namestnichestvo&quot; under the control of a namiestnik until 1875, when it became a Guberniya. 

==Government==
The government of Congress Poland was outlined in the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland in 1815. The emperor of Russia was the official head of state, considered the king of Poland, with the local government headed by the viceroy of the Kingdom of Poland (), Council of State and Administrative Council, in addition to the Sejm.

In theory, Congress Poland possessed one of the most liberal governments of the time in Europe, but in practice, the area was a puppet state of the Russian Empire. The liberal provisions of the constitution, and the scope of the autonomy, were often disregarded by the Russian officials.

Polish remained an official language until the mid-1860s when it was replaced by Russian. This resulted in bilingual street signs and documents, however, the full implementation of Cyrillic script into the Polish language failed.

===Executive leadership===

The office of &quot;namiestnik&quot; was introduced in Poland by the 1815 constitution of Congress Poland. The viceroy was chosen by the king from among the noble citizens of the Russian Empire or the Kingdom of Poland. The viceroy supervised the entire public administration and, in the monarch&#x27;s absence, chaired the Council of State, as well as the Administrative Council. He could veto the councils&#x27; decisions; other than that, his decisions had to be countersigned by the appropriate government minister. The viceroy exercised broad powers and could nominate candidates for most senior government posts (ministers, senators, judges of the High Tribunal, councilors of state, referendaries, bishops, and archbishops). He had no competence in the realms of finances and foreign policy; his military competence varied.

The office of &quot;namiestnik&quot; or viceroy was never abolished; however, the last &quot;namiestnik&quot; was Friedrich Wilhelm Rembert von Berg, who served from 1863 to his death in 1874. No &quot;namiestnik&quot; was named to replace him; however, the role of &quot;namestnik&quot;—viceroy of the former kingdom passed to the governor-general of Warsaw—or, to be more specific, of the Warsaw Military District (, ).

The governor-general answered directly to the emperor and exercised much broader powers than had the &quot;namiestnik&quot;. In particular, he controlled all the military forces in the region and oversaw the judicial systems (he could impose death sentences without trial). He could also issue &quot;declarations with the force of law,&quot; which could alter existing laws.

===Administrative Council===

The &quot;Administrative Council&quot; () was a part of the Council of State of the kingdom. Introduced by the Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland in 1815, it was composed of five ministers, special nominees of the king and the viceroy of the Kingdom of Poland. The council executed the king&#x27;s will and ruled in the cases outside the minister&#x27;s competence and prepared projects for the Council of State.

==Administrative divisions==

The administrative divisions of the kingdom changed several times over its history, and various smaller reforms were also carried out which either changed the smaller administrative units or merged/split various subdivisions.

Immediately after its creation in 1815, the Kingdom of Poland was divided into departments, a relic from the times of the French-dominated Duchy of Warsaw.

On 16 January 1816 the administrative division was reformed, with the departments being replaced with more traditionally Polish voivodeships (of which there were eight), obwóds and powiats. On 7 March 1837, in the aftermath of the November Uprising earlier that decade, the administrative division was reformed again, bringing Congress Poland closer to the structure of the Russian Empire, with the introduction of guberniyas (governorate, Polish spelling &quot;&quot;). In 1842 the powiats were renamed okręgs, and the obwóds were renamed powiats. In 1844 several governorates were merged with others, and some others were renamed; five governorates remained.

In 1867, following the failure of the January Uprising, further reforms were instituted which were designed to bring the administrative structure of Poland closer to that of the Russian Empire. It divided larger governorates into smaller ones, introduced the gmina (a new lower-level entity), and restructured the existing five governorates into 10. The 1912 reform created a new governorate – Kholm Governorate – from parts of the Sedlets and Lublin Governorates. It was made part of the Southwestern Krai of the Russian Empire.

==Economy==
Despite the fact that the economic situation varied at times, Congress Poland was one of the largest economies in the world. In the mid 1800s the region became heavily industrialized, however, agriculture still maintained a major role in the economy. In addition, the export of wheat, rye and other crops was significant in stabilizing the financial output. An important trade partner of Congress Poland was Great Britain, which imported goods in large amounts.

Since agriculture was equivalent to 70% of the national income, the most important economic transformations included the establishment of mines and the textile industry; the development of these sectors brought more profit and higher tax revenues. The beginnings were difficult due to floods and an intense diplomatic relationship with Prussia. It was not until 1822 when Prince Francis Xavier Drucki-Lubecki negotiated to open the Polish market to the world. He also tried to introduce appropriate protective duties. A large and profitable investment was the construction of the Augustów Canal connecting Narew and Neman Rivers, which allowed to bypass Danzig (Gdańsk) and high Prussian tariffs. Drucki-Lubecki also founded the Bank Polski, for which he is mostly remembered.

The first Polish steam mill was built in 1828 in Warsaw-Solec; the first textile machine was installed in 1829. Greater use of machines led to production in the form of workshops. The government was also encouraging foreign specialists, mostly Germans, to upkeep larger establishments, or to undertake production. By 1887, 550 of the 29,000 Prussian landowners in Poland were manufacturers. The Germans were also relieved of the tax burden. This allowed to create one of the largest European textile centres in Łódź and in surrounding towns like Ozorków and Zduńska Wola. These small and initially insignificant settlements later developed into large and multicultural cities, where Germans and Jews were the majority in the population. With the abolition of border customs in 1851 and further economic growth, Polish cities were gaining wealth and importance. Most notably, Warsaw, being associated with the construction of railway lines and bridges, gained priority in the entire Russian market.

Although the economic and industrial progress occurred rapidly, most of the farms, called &quot;folwarks&quot;, chose to rely on serfs and paid workforce. Only a few experimented by obtaining proper machinery and plowing equipment from England. New crops were being cultivated like sugar beet, which marked the beginning of Polish sugar refineries. The use of iron cutters and plows was also favoured among the farmers. During the January Uprising the occupying authorities sought to deprive peasant insurgents of their popularity among landed gentry. Taxes were raised and the overall economic situation of commoners worsened. The noblemen and landowners were, on the other hand, provided with more privileges, rights and even financial support in the form of bribery. The aim of this was to weaken their support for the rebellion against the Russian Empire.

Congress Poland was the largest supplier of zinc in Europe. The development of the zinc industry took place at the beginning of the 19th century. It was mostly caused by the significant increase of demand for zinc mainly in industrialized countries of Western Europe.

In 1899, Aleksander Ginsberg founded the company &quot;FOS&quot; (&quot;Fabryka Przyrządów Optycznych&quot;-&quot;Factory of Optical Equipment&quot;) in Warsaw. It was one of firms in the Russian Empire which crafted and produced cameras, telescopes, objectives and stereoscopes. Following the outbreak of World War I the factory was moved to St. Petersburg.

In the late 1890s and early 1900s, Russia experienced a coal crisis marked by coal shortages and high prices. This was attributed to the dramatic increase of industrial output and a still nascent coal mining industry. In 1900, because of coal shortages in the Warsaw industrial region, the Minister of Finance approved the duty-free import of 125,000,000 poods of coal.

==Demographics==
According to the Russian Empire Census of 1897, Congress Poland had a population of 9,402,253: 4,712,090 men and 4,690,163 women.

<text>Operation Echo was the codename given by the Canadian Forces for its air activities during the Kosovo War in 1999. In support of the NATO Operation Allied Force Canadian aircraft based at Aviano Air Base in northeastern Italy flew bombing missions over the Balkans.

During the campaign the Canadian air contingent consisted of 18 CF-18 Hornet aircraft from 441 and 425 Tactical Fighter Squadrons, with 69 aircrew and 250 ground crew. Between March 24 and June 10, 1999, they flew 684 sorties in 224 missions, and dropped nearly of gravity and precision-guided bombs. Canadian forces comprised less than 2% of the nearly 1,000 Allied aircraft engaged in the conflict, they flew on 10% of all bombing missions.

<text>Neagoe Basarab (; – 15 September 1521) was the Voivode (Prince) of Wallachia between 1512 and 1521. Born into the boyar family of the Craiovești (his reign marks the climax of the family&#x27;s political influence) as the son of Pârvu Craiovescu or Basarab Țepeluș cel Tânăr, Neagoe Basarab, who replaced Vlad cel Tânăr after the latter rejected Craioveşti tutelage, was noted for his abilities and competence. He is sometimes mentioned as Neagoe Basarab IV, due to other Wallachian rulers by the name Basarab (not &quot;Neagoe&quot; Basarab) preceding him on the throne, some of them certain members of the House of Basarab and some less so.

== Early Life ==
The early life of Neagoe is mostly unknown before his rise to political prominence. His slow rise to power was influenced in large part by the help of his grandfather Neagoe Craiovescu, who pushed from 1508 for his ascendence to the throne. This can be seen in his rising up in political appointments:

* Neagoe acted as &quot;Reckoner&quot; (a kind of secretary) to Patriarch Saint Nephon II during the reign of Radu the Great. Although he served the Patriarch, Nephon is reported to have sought &quot;teaching and soul food&quot; from Neagoe.
* From December 25, 1501 until June 19, 1509 Neagoe acted as a High Seneschal. 
* From April 2, 1510 until November 28, 1511 Neagoe acted as High Equerry to the reigning Vlad cel Tânăr.

Mihnea fled Wallachia in 1510 while being pursued by the Craiovescu faction, and Mircea left Wallachia around 26 January 1510, after a battle near Cotmeana with an Ottoman army led by Neagoe Basarab. In November 28, 1511 Neagoe helps capture Mircea and chase him out of the country.

After Pârvu, Bogdan took over the Divan. After November Vlad cel Tânăr and the Craiovești family developed a falling out. The boyars, accustomed to being in the head of the state, were envious of Bogdan&#x27;s authority. Moreover, Vlad suspected Neagoe of wanting to become the Prince of Wallachia. Vlad summons the Craiovești and makes them swear that Neagoe is not the son of a Lord, threatening to cut off their nose or eyes. As a result, the boyars swear formally, but then deserted Vlad and crossed the Danube to Mehmet. With his help, the Ottoman army and Neagoe started marching to Bucharest. At Văcărești, the battle was lost for Vlad and he was taken prisoner. Neagoe was placed upon the throne using a dubious claim to be the illegitimate Son of Basarab Țepeluș cel Tânăr and his mother Neaga.

==Reign==
In the 16th century, Wallachia was independent, but was required to pay an exorbitant tribute to the greater force of the Ottoman Empire. Neagoe encouraged the development of crafts and trade, while maintaining a good relation with Wallachia&#x27;s other powerful neighbour, Hungary.

His diplomacy attempted to establish connections with the Republic of Venice and the Papacy, even offering to mediate the dispute between Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, with the purpose of uniting Christendom against the Ottoman threat.

He adopted the Byzantine tradition of Church patronage, making generous donations to the Orthodox monasteries, not only in Wallachia but throughout the Balkans. During his reign the Curtea de Argeș Monastery was built (in 1517) – legend names Meșterul Manole as the chief craftsman; the account also fuses Neagoe with yet another legendary figure, Prince Radu (who would&#x27;ve caused Manole&#x27;s death by ordering for the scaffolding to be removed while the builders were on the roof, ensuring that nobody would use Manole&#x27;s craft, and thus preserving the uniqueness of the structure).

Neagoe ordered the earliest works on the old Metropolitan church in Târgoviște (the city where the edition of the Gospels was published in 1512) and St. Nicholas Church in Șcheii Brașovului.

Neagoe Basarab wrote in Church Slavonic one of the earliest literary works of Wallachia, called &quot;The teachings of Neagoe Basarab to his son Theodosie&quot; (translated in Romanian as &quot;Învățăturile lui Neagoe Basarab către fiul său Teodosie&quot;), where he touches various subjects such as philosophy, diplomacy, morals and ethics.

After his death, Neagoe was buried at the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral. 

==Family==
He married Milica Despina, daughter of Serbia. Among their children are Teodosie of Wallachia and Ruxandra, wife of Radu of Afumați and Radu Paisie, both princes of Wallachia.

==Canonisation==
On 8 July 2008, the Holy Synod of the Romanian Orthodox Church officially canonised Neagoe Basarab. His feast day is celebrated every year on 26 September.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Gunmakers, incorporating the London Proof House, is one of the 111 livery companies of the City of London.

== History ==
The Gunmakers&#x27; Company received its royal charter of incorporation in 1637. The Proof House has statutory duties to regulate the safety of firearms in the United Kingdom. To administer proof, the company was given broad powers of &#x27;search, gage, proof, trial and mark&#x27;. The power to search (with a constable) for unproved guns and seize them is still vested in the company today.

Since 1675, the company has been located at the London Proof House on Commercial Road, just east (outside) of Aldgate and the old City walls, in Whitechapel. It is unique amongst livery companies for being located outside the City Wall.

The Gunmakers&#x27; Company ranks seventy-third in the order of precedence of the livery companies.

== Services ==
The major three activities of the Proof House are: proof, safety and de-activation.

Proof is the process of testing the safety of a gun barrel. It is still done as it has been since the company was established in 1637: by test-firing the gun with an over-pressure charge of powder. If the gun survives undamaged, it will be safe to shoot. If it doesn’t, it is deemed unfit for sale – and kept from the hands of the public. Although modern non-destructive inspection techniques enable the examination of the internal structure of metal to a high degree of accuracy, there is still no better way of determining which weaknesses and imperfections might prove dangerous to the user. 

The Gun Barrel Proof Acts specify the rules under which proof is carried out.

Unlike many livery companies, the Gunmakers have retained an active link to their trade and consults with the government on related firearms regulation.

The testing technique involves test-firing a gun barrel, or the barrel and action using specially manufactured and controlled proof ammunition, that develops in the order of 125% of the normal service pressure intended for the gun in question. The gun is securely held in a special carriage fixture within a dedicated proof chamber and fired remotely . The barrel, or barrel and action are then inspected. 

If they have maintained structural integrity, they will be stamped with proof marks indicating the test pressure, bore diameter in millimetres at 9&quot; from the breech face, chamber length, suitability for use with steel shot or not in the case of a smoothbore shotgun, a date stamp or code and the mark of the proof house that tested the firearm (London or Birmingham).

The Society of the Mystery of Gunmakers of the City of London is one of only two organisations (the other being the Birmingham Proof House) approved by the Secretary of State for the deactivation and subsequent certification of the deactivation of firearms under section 58(1) Firearms Act 1968.

De-activation of firearms is a process where the gun is altered in such a way as to render them permanently incapable of firing and thus completely safe for collectors. 

The Proof House Committee, which is appointed by the court of the Gunmakers’ Company, is responsible for regulating and executing the proving of small arms in accordance with the company’s charter and the Gun Barrel Proof Acts. The Proof Master, who is appointed by the court, is responsible for the day to day running and operations of the Proof House

Master Gunmakers are recognised by the Worshipful Company of Gunmakers and identified by the post nominal: MAsR.G

<text>The Worshipful Company of Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers were incorporated by royal charter in 1693; the City granted it the status of a livery company in 1780. The craft originally associated with the company, namely the making of gold and silver thread for uniforms or ceremonial clothing, has declined but is still practised. Thus nowadays the company functions mainly as a charitable body.

The Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers&#x27; Company ranks seventy-fourth in the order of precedence of City livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Amicitiam Trahit Amor&quot;, Latin for &quot;Love leads to friendship&quot; — or, more literally, &quot;love &quot;draws&quot; friendship,&quot; a punning reference to the guild&#x27;s ancient craft.

The Gold and Silver Wyre Drawers&#x27; Company also has an associated Masonic Lodge, consecrated on 29 October 1945, membership of which is open only to Liverymen of the company, its motto being &quot;The Lodge of Love and Friendship&quot;, a play on words of the ancient livery company&#x27;s motto.

<doc id="375584" wikidata="Q8037060" url="?curid=375584" title="Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards is one of the livery companies of the City of London, incorporated in 1628, and ranking at No.75 in the order of precedence. It is limited to 150 members, and its livery colours are red and white.

==History==
The company was incorporated by royal charter granted by Charles I with effect from 22 October 1628, and was granted livery status on 27 November 1792 with a limit of a hundred members. On 21 July 1903 the limit was increased to 150. In order of precedence, the Makers of Playing Cards are No. 75, and the livery colours are red and white.

The company was created in order to regulate and control the importation of cheap playing cards, to protect the card makers and their families, and to maintain quality. The Crown received the benefit of the duties levied by the company agreeing to pay a tax on all packs, and the ace of spades was chosen to show the tax. Every maker of playing cards had to have a mark of his own enrolled to indicate recognition of his name. The excise duty on playing cards was abolished on 4 April 1960, as the cost of administration had become excessive.

The true origin of the company’s coat of arms is unknown, but an official grant of arms was presented on 31 March 1982. The shield shows the four suits with an upright hand holding an ace of hearts. The motto is ‘&quot;Corde Recto Elati Omnes&quot;’ meaning ‘with an upright heart all will be exalted’.

==Traditions==
Since 1882, the company has designed and presented an annual double pack of playing cards to each liveryman and freeman of the company at the installation of the new master. Since 1888, a portrait of the master has appeared at the centre of the ace of spades, and the design chosen and developed by the master has traditionally commemorated an event of importance occurring in the twelve months of the master’s year in office, such as the company’s first lord mayor and sheriff, or some royal or historical celebration. The company maintains and expands its world-famous collection of playing cards first presented by past master Henry Phillips in 1907 and housed by arrangement with the City of London at the London Metropolitan Archives. The company is undertaking a project to make digitised images of the collection available for internet access.

==The Charitable Trust==
Formed in 1943, in the year of the mastership of Lindsay Cutler, and administered by trustees, the funds accumulated by members’ donations and fundraising generate income used to help those under the age of 25 for educational purposes as well as financial aid to overcome hardship and distress. Benefactors include the Lord Mayor’s Appeal and various hospices.

==The company today==
Since the formation of the company in the Middle Ages, the production and use of playing cards in London has declined. Today the company still has cardmakers as members. However the company has many other members connected with playing cards in some way including card collectors, dealers, bridge players, magicians and other professions.

The company has several affiliations recognising the role that the Armed Services provide. Their affiliations include the naval destroyer HMS &quot;Diamond&quot;, and 19 Company; Middlesex &amp; NW London Army Cadet Force and also 82 squadron Royal Air Force Air Cadets.

<text>Operation Addition was the name given to the Canadian contribution to United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea, the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Ethiopia and Eritrea after the Eritrean–Ethiopian War.
It began in late 2000 with Operation Eclipse during which the Canadians worked as part of a joint battle group with the Dutch peace-keeping forces.
The Canadian contingent was part of an international team monitoring the Temporary Security Zone between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
The commitment ended in June 2003.

<text>Dunchurch is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Rugby, approximately south-west of central Rugby in Warwickshire, England. The civil parish, which also includes the nearby hamlet of Toft, had a population of 4,123 at the 2021 Census, a significant increase from 2,938 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
The earliest historical reference to Dunchurch was in the Domesday Book of 1086, which mentioned a settlement called &quot;Don Cerce&quot;.

The core of the village has been declared a conservation area because it has many buildings of historical interest. Some of the buildings date to the 15th century are timber-framed and still have traditional thatch roofs.

As Dunchurch was located at the crossroads of the coaching roads between London and Birmingham (now the A45 road) (classified as B4429 through the village) and Oxford and Leicester (now the A426 road), it was for centuries an important staging post. At one point, there were 27 coaching inns in Dunchurch to cater for travellers. Two of these still remain; the &#x27;Dun Cow&#x27; and &#x27;The Green Man&#x27;

Many notable people have stayed at Dunchurch. Most notably, in 1605 the Gunpowder Plotters stayed at the &#x27;Lion Inn&#x27; (now a private residence called &#x27;Guy Fawkes House&#x27;) in Dunchurch, convened by Sir Everard Digby, awaiting news of Guy Fawkes&#x27;s attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament. If he had been successful they planned to kidnap the King&#x27;s daughter Princess Elizabeth from nearby Coombe Abbey.

Other well known people who have stayed in the village include the young Queen Victoria (before she became Queen) and the Duke of Wellington. Robert Stephenson stayed in Dunchurch when supervising the construction of the Kilsby Tunnel during the building of the London and Birmingham Railway.

Dunchurch was for many centuries a more important settlement than nearby Rugby, that changed however with the coming of the railways in the 19th century; Rugby became a major railway centre and grew into a large town, this led to a dramatic decline in the coaching trade, and a decline in the importance of Dunchurch. However, from 1871 until 1964 the village was served by its own railway station about two miles from the village on the Rugby to Leamington Spa line.

The ancient parish of Dunchurch included the village itself, plus the nearby settlements of Cawston, Thurlaston, and Toft; The former two have become separate civil parishes. In the early 1930s part of the civil parish of Dunchurch was transferred to Rugby, and the part of the parish of Bilton which was not merged with Rugby was transferred to Dunchurch.

==Education==
There are three schools in the area: Dunchurch Infant and Nursery School (School Street), Dunchurch Boughton C of E Junior School (Dew Close) and Bilton Grange Preparatory School (Rugby Road).

==Religion==

There are three churches in the village: St Peter&#x27;s (Church of England) in the centre, a Methodist chapel in Cawston Lane and a Baptist church on the outskirts of the village on the Coventry road.

St Peter&#x27;s, dating from the 12th century, is a grade II* listed building.

==Culture==
The village has a sportsfield on Rugby Road donated to the village by Baron Waring in the 1920s. Currently Dunchurch &amp; Bilton Cricket Club play in the summer months and Dunchurch Football Club play in the winter. Cricket has been played on the land since the 1800s. In 1999 Dunchurch Cricket Club merged with Bilton Cricket Club to form Dunchurch &amp; Bilton Cricket Club. The changing rooms for the pitches are found adjacent to the village hall which was opened in 2003. There is a large main hall which can seat up to 160 people as well as a smaller sports room. Both have attached kitchens.

Other groups in the village include: Dunchurch Silver Band, District of Dunchurch Brass, Dunchurch Festival Group, Guides, Dunchurch Health Walks, Scouts, Mothers&#x27; Union, Photographic Club, St. Peter&#x27;s Bell Ringers, Dunchurch Twinning Association, Dunchurch and Thurlaston Women&#x27;s Institute, Working Men&#x27;s Club.

==Statue==
In the centre of Dunchurch is a statue of Lord John Douglas-Montagu-Scott (1809–1860) a 19th-century landlord, Scottish M.P. and younger brother of the 5th Duke of Buccleuch. The statue is by the Victorian sculptor Joseph Durham A.R.A..

Since the 1970s an annual tradition has developed in the village for a group of pranksters to secretly dress up the statue as a cartoon or TV character overnight at the beginning of the Christmas holidays. The statue was dressed up as Queen Elizabeth II during her diamond jubilee weekend celebrations. In 2012 the statue was dressed up as an Olympian for the final leg of the Olympic torch relay sporting a headband and runners jersey. 2017 saw the statue become Paddington Bear, and 2018 The Grinch.
== Notable residents==

==Twinning==
In 1987, Dunchurch was twinned with the village of Ferrières-en-Brie in France.

==Legacy==
In 1877, the community of Newcombe in Ontario was renamed Dunchurch, Ontario by then postmaster George Kelcey after his birthplace in Warwickshire.

<doc id="375589" wikidata="Q977651" url="?curid=375589" title="John Marsden (writer)">
<text>John Marsden (27 September 1950 – 18 December 2024) was an Australian writer and teacher. He wrote more than 40 books in his career including his young adult novel &quot;Tomorrow, When the War Began&quot;, which began a series of seven books.

Marsden began writing for children while working as a teacher, and had his first book, &quot;So Much to Tell You&quot;, published in 1987. In 2006, he started an alternative school, Candlebark School, and reduced his writing to focus on teaching and running the school. In 2016, he opened the arts-focused secondary school, Alice Miller School. Both schools are in the Macedon Ranges of Victoria.

==Early life and education==
John Marsden was born on 27 September 1950 in Melbourne. He had three siblings. He spent the first 10 years of his life living in the country towns of Kyneton and Devonport, Tasmania. He was a great-great-great-great nephew of colonial Anglican clergyman and magistrate Samuel Marsden. 

When Marsden was 10 years old, he moved to Sydney and attended The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta. He was accepted into the University of Sydney to study a double degree in law and arts, but eventually dropped out. He worked at different jobs, including an abattoir, working in a mortuary, delivering pizzas, working as a motorbike courier, working as a nightwatchman, selling encyclopaedias, and working with chickens.

==Career==

===Early career===
While working at Geelong Grammar School&#x27;s Timbertop campus as an English teacher, Marsden made the decision to write for teenagers, following his dissatisfaction with his students&#x27; apathy towards reading, or the observation that teenagers simply were not reading anymore. Marsden then wrote &quot;So Much to Tell You&quot; in only three weeks, and the book was published in 1987. The book sold record numbers and won numerous awards including &quot;Book of the Year&quot; as awarded by the Children&#x27;s Book Council of Australia (CBCA).

In the five years following the publication of &quot;So Much To Tell You&quot;, Marsden published six more books. Notable works from this period are &quot;Out of Time&quot;, which was nominated by the CBCA as a notable book for older readers, and &quot;Letters From the Inside&quot; and a sequel to &quot;So Much to Tell You&quot; called &quot;Take My Word For It&quot;, which were both shortlisted for the CBCA&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book of the Year: Older Readers award. Upon publication in the United States, &quot;Letters From the Inside&quot; received accolades from The Horn Book Magazine and the American Library Association. American novelist Robert Cormier found the novel &quot;unforgettable&quot; and described Marsden as a &quot;major writer deserving of world-wide acclaim&quot;.

===Later career===

In 1993, Marsden published &quot;Tomorrow, When the War Began&quot;, the first book in the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; series and his most acclaimed work. Marsden went on to write seven books in the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; series, together with a follow-up trilogy, &quot;The Ellie Chronicles&quot;.

At the same time as writing the &quot;Tomorrow&quot; series, Marsden wrote several other novels such as &quot;Checkers&quot;, edited works such as &quot;This I Believe&quot;, wrote children&#x27;s picture books such as &quot;The Rabbits&quot;, poetry such as &quot;Prayer for the Twenty-First Century&quot;, and non-fiction works such as &quot;Everything I Know About Writing&quot; and &quot;Secret Men&#x27;s Business&quot;. He wrote more than 40 books in his career. His last novel, titled &quot;Take Risks&quot;, was published in 2021.

===Themes===
Marsden&#x27;s earlier works are largely novels aimed at teenage or young adult audience. Common themes in Marsden&#x27;s works include sexuality, violence in society, survival at school and in a harsh world, and conflict with adult authority figures. However, Marsden also declared that he wished to write about &quot;things that have always been important for humans... [such as] love, for a start. And the absence of love. The way people relate to each other. The way people solve problems. Courage. Spirit. The human spirit.&quot;

== Pseudonymous novel ==

In 1994, a sexually explicit adult novel “Lost To View” written by Marsden was published under the name “James Hordern”. It tells the story of a teenage runaway who becomes a sex worker. Marsden acknowledged that he was the author of this novel in an interview with the Weekend Australian in 2019, saying “I might as well stop being coy about it … plus you’ll never find it anyway.” 

== Recognition and accolades ==
In 1996, Marsden&#x27;s books took the top six places on the Teenage Fiction best-seller lists for Australia. Also in 1996, he was named &quot;Australia&#x27;s most popular author today in any literary field&quot; by &quot;The Australian&quot;. In 1997, Australian readers voted three of his books into Australia&#x27;s 100 most-loved books of all time. His books have also been translated into many languages. As of 1999, his works had been translated into 13 languages, including Norwegian, Afrikaans and Persian.

Marsden won every major writing award in Australia for young people&#x27;s fiction, including what he described as one of the highlights of his career, the 2006 Lloyd O&#x27;Neil Award for contributions to Australian publishing. This award meant that Marsden was one of only five authors to be honoured for lifelong services to the Australian book industry at the time. 

He was twice named among Best Books of the Year by the American Library Association and once by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, was runner-up for Dutch Children&#x27;s Book of the Year and short-listed for the German Young Readers&#x27; Award, won the Grand Jury Prize as Austria&#x27;s Most Popular Writer for Teenagers, and won the coveted Buxtehude Bull in Germany.

In 2008 he was nominated for the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award, the world&#x27;s largest children&#x27;s and youth literature award and the second largest literature prize in the world.

In 2014, Lyndon Terracini announced that Opera Australia had co-commissioned Kate Miller-Heidke to write an opera based on Marsden&#x27;s &quot;The Rabbits&quot;. The work, &quot;The Rabbits&quot;, premiered in 2015 in Perth, and was staged in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, winning several awards. 

In December 2018, Marsden was awarded the Dromkeen Medal, in recognition of his outstanding achievement in children&#x27;s and young adult literature.

In April 2021, University of the Sunshine Coast awarded Marsden with an honorary doctorate.

== Controversy ==

In promoting his book “The Art Of Growing Up” on the ABC Radio National program Life Matters Marsden spoke about bullying, saying “A lot of the so-called bullying in schools is just kids giving each other feedback...it’s rare for a child who’s got likeable qualities to be treated in some sort of horrific or bullying way.” which was widely criticised. Marsden defended his views, going on to say that students from other cultures were bullied less at Geelong Grammar if they were more “Westernised”, saying &quot;If they were able to speak English fluently and wear the clothes that Anglo kids wore and listened to the same kind of music, then they were fully accepted. There was absolutely no racism involved&quot;.

==Schools==
In 2006, Marsden started an alternative school, Candlebark School, catering for years K–12, in the Macedon Ranges. He reduced his writing to focus on teaching and running the school. In 2016, he opened the arts-focused secondary school, Alice Miller School, also in the Macedon Ranges.

== Personal life, death and legacy ==
Marsden was married to Kristin, and had six stepsons. He lived in Lancefield, Victoria from 2014 until 2021 and in Romsey, Victoria from 2021, where he died on 18 December 2024, at the age of 74. Alice Miller School wrote a letter to parents, stating that he had died while writing at his desk at home. 

Marsden was the patron of Express Media, a youth arts organisation, which awarded the annual John Marsden Prize for Young Australian Writers from 2005. Marsden initially funded and judged the award. The prize was renamed in 2020 to the Hachette Australia Prize for Young Writers.

<doc id="375595" wikidata="Q5158909" url="?curid=375595" title="Concordant coastline">
<text>In coastal geography, a concordant, longitudinal, or Pacific type coastline occurs where beds, or layers, of differing rock types are folded into ridges that run parallel to the coast. The outer hard rock (for example, granite) provides a protective barrier to erosion of the softer rocks (for example, clays) further inland. Sometimes the outer hard rock is punctured, allowing the sea to erode the softer rocks behind. This creates a cove, a circular area of water with a relatively narrow entrance from the sea.

Lulworth Cove in Dorset is situated on a concordant coastline. The outer hard rock is Portland limestone. The sea has broken through this barrier and easily eroded the clays behind it. A chalk cliff face at the back of the cove slows further erosion. Erosion is just starting to the west, where the sea has again broken through the Portland limestone barrier at Stair Hole.

The concordant coast may take one of two landform types. The Dalmatian type, named from Dalmatia on the Adriatic Sea, features long offshore islands and coastal inlets that are parallel to the coastline. The Adriatic Sea itself is a concordant landform, consisting of a body of water between parallel ranges. These Dalmatian types normally occur in high energy environments from where there is eustatic or isostatic change creating a submerging coastline. The second landform is the Haff type as in the Haffs, or lagoons, of the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, which are enclosed by long spits of sand parallel to the low coast.

The converse of concordant coastline is a discordant coastline.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Carmen is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, whose origins date back to 1517.

Carmen, or drivers of carts, caused upset in 1481. The King conscripted carts to carry his wine allowing rural carters to force food prices up. By offering to provide the King&#x27;s carriage and clean the streets the Fellowship of Carmen was established in 1517 with authority to control the cartage trade. Carmen organised themselves into a fraternity and plied for hire. However, this was contested by the Woodmongers&#x27; Company, who owned more carts. The Carmen turned to Christ&#x27;s Hospital, who were short of cash at the time. However, by 1597 the Carmen had fallen out with Christ&#x27;s Hospital, the Woodmongers asserted their control again, and absorbed the Carmen in 1605. However alongside other rearrangements in the haulage trade, the Carmen separated and formed their own fellowship in 1668, but were unsuccessful in gaining the power to regulate carmen, until the Woodmongers became defunct in 1746. The Carmen did not acquire a Royal Charter until 1946.

Now that carts have been rendered obsolete by trucks and vans, the Carmen remain as a charitable and ceremonial institution with over 500 Liverymen, 180 Freemen plus additional 23 apprentices. The Carmen organise the ceremony of Cart Marking, which originated in the rule that no cart could ply for hire within the City of London unless licensed by the Corporation. Presently, the ceremony involves human powered, horsed, steam, fossil fuelled or electric, old and new vehicles rather than carts.

The Carmen&#x27;s Company ranks seventy-seventh in the order of precedence for Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Scite, Cite, Certo&quot;, Latin for &quot;Skilfully, Swiftly, Surely&quot;. It was granted a livery in 1848; there would not be another new livery company until the Honourable Company of Master Mariners, formed in 1932.

<text>Teobert Maler, later Teoberto (12 January 1842 – 22 November 1917), was an explorer who devoted his energies to documenting the ruins of the Maya civilization.

==Biography==
Teobert Maler was born on January 12, 1842, in Rome, Italy, to Friedrich Maler, a diplomat representing the Grand Duchy of Baden, and Wilhelmine Schwarz. His mother passed away in 1844 during the family&#x27;s return to Baden, leaving Maler and his sister to be raised by their father. The early loss of his mother profoundly shaped Maler’s character, fostering a sense of independence and emotional resilience. His relationship with his father was distant and strained, a dynamic Maler later described in his autobiography &quot;Leben meiner Jugend&quot; (&quot;My Younger Years&quot;).

Maler studied engineering and architecture at the Polytechnic University in Karlsruhe (now Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), where he gained technical expertise that later influenced his detailed documentation of Maya ruins. In 1863, he moved to Vienna to work under Heinrich von Ferstel at the age of 21, a prominent architect known for designing the neo-Gothic Votive Church on Vienna&#x27;s Ringstraße and became an Austrian citizen. Ferstel’s mentorship instilled in Maler a strong appreciation for precision and artistic composition, skills that became integral to his archaeological work. 

In 1864, Maler joined the military expedition of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico as a cadet and rose to the rank of captain. His initial interest in Mexico was centered on its colonial architecture, but following the fall of Maximilian&#x27;s regime in 1867, Maler decided to remain in the country rather than being exiled back to Europe. This marked the beginning of his lifelong fascination with Mesoamerican culture and history, ultimately leading to his pioneering work documenting Maya ruins. Maler later obtained Mexican citizenship and changed his first name to &quot;Teoberto&quot;, more easily pronounced in the Spanish language. 

Maler developed interests in photography and in the antiquities of Mesoamerica. In 1876 he made detailed photos of the structures at Mitla. In the summer of the following year he moved to San Cristóbal de las Casas, and in July set out to visit the ruins of Palenque. While several accounts of the site had been published by this time, it was still little visited, and Maler needed to employ a team of the local &quot;Indios&quot; to open a path to the ruin with machetes. He spent a week at Palenque, sketching, measuring, and photographing the site, and became aware that earlier published accounts were inadequate, and that most earlier visitors had limited their descriptions to only a portion of the buildings observed there. While Maler was there another visitor came to the ruins, Gustave Bernoulli, a Swiss botanist who shared his interest in Maya sites, and had recently made a visit to Tikal. Bernoulli confirmed Maler&#x27;s suspicion that there was much work that needed to be done to document the area&#x27;s ruins.

In the spring of 1878, Maler was obliged to return to Europe to settle his father&#x27;s estate, which was tied up in considerable legal difficulties. While the lawyers he hired sorted it out, Maler lived in Paris, where he gave lectures on Mexican antiquities and studied and read everything about Mesoamerica he could find in the city. In 1884 the estate was settled, with Maler inheriting a small fortune, and he returned to Mexico to devote himself to study of the Maya.

He settled in Yucatán with small house in the town of Ticul, where he set up a photographic studio and learned the Maya language. However he spent most of his time in the forests, accompanied by a few Maya to help clear the jungle from the ruins and carry Maler&#x27;s photographic equipment. He started off visiting major sites already well-known, such as Chichen Itza and Uxmal, but zealously followed all leads and became the first to document many new ruins. At Chichen, he lived in the ruins for 3 months, and documented the site much more fully than had earlier visitors.

Over the next years, Maler also made investigations of many remote sites in the el Petén region of Guatemala and along the course of the Usumacinta River.
Maler became disgusted by the then common practice of 19th century antiquarians and archeologists of removing interesting sculptures from the sites to send to cities in Europe or North America. Maler noted the damage to the sites this often caused. He became dedicated to the notion that the ruins should be preserved intact, and wrote extensively to the Mexican government advocating that approach. Maler&#x27;s views are now considered ahead of their time.

Maler realized the importance of publishing his investigations, but had somewhat mixed success. The Peabody Institute of Harvard University arranged to publish his reports starting in 1898. A series of important books resulted, but the relationship between Maler and the Peabody was strained. Maler tried to insist that the books contain more minute detail and illustrations than the Peabody editors wished to include, and communications were difficult as Maler often left to make new expeditions in the forests and could not be contacted for months at a time for proofreading. The Peabody ended their agreement with Maler in 1909, although it took them until 1912 to finish the publication of the material they had received from him. The books are still an important reference in Maya studies.

Maler ended his physically demanding expeditions in the jungles in 1905 and retired to his home in Mérida, Yucatán.

In 1910 Maler made a trip to Europe in hopes of finding patrons for publishing more of his reports, but had no success other than to sell some of his photographs to the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris.

In his later years Teoberto Maler was known as something of a misanthrope. His money apparently gone due to some poor money investments and the economical crisis of 1907 in Yucatán, he made a modest living selling copies of his photographs to tourists and young archaeologists and giving lectures on Maya art and architecture at the Mérida school of fine arts. Maler died in Mérida, aged 75.

Many of his accounts were published posthumously, one batch in the 1930s, more in the 1970s and 1990s.

<text>BBC Monitoring (BBCM) is a division of the British Broadcasting Corporation which monitors, and reports on, mass media worldwide using open-source intelligence. Based at New Broadcasting House, the BBC&#x27;s headquarters in central London, it has overseas bureaux in Cairo, Delhi, Istanbul, Jerusalem, Kyiv, Miami, Nairobi, Ramallah, Tashkent and Tbilisi.

A signals-receiving station for BBC Monitoring is at Crowsley Park in South Oxfordshire, close to BBCM&#x27;s former (1943–2018) headquarters at Caversham Park. The service&#x27;s first home (1939–1943) was at Wood Norton Hall in Worcestershire.

BBC Monitoring selects and translates information from radio, television, the press, news agencies and online outlets from 150 countries in up to 100 languages. Reporting produced by the service is used by the government of the United Kingdom and commercial customers such as Oxford Analytica, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and Liverpool John Moores University. The BBC announced in July 2017 that it planned to sell the site at Caversham Park and move employees to London, which took place in May 2018.

==History==
The organisation was formed in 1939 to provide the British Government with access to foreign media and propaganda. It provided the government with valuable information during World War II, particularly in places where foreign journalists were banned. The organisation played an important role in helping observers keep track of developments during the Cold War, the disintegration of the Iron Curtain and collapse of the Soviet Union. Also monitored were the Yugoslav Wars and the Middle East. They also had 7 decades of collaboration with the CIA Foreign Broadcast Information Service.

==Funding==
Although administratively and editorially part of the BBC, until 2013 BBC Monitoring did not receive any funding from the licence fee; instead it was funded directly by its stakeholders as well as by subscriptions from official and commercial bodies throughout the world. The principal stakeholder is the Cabinet Office and subscriptions were also received from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the BBC World Service. Other customers include other government departments, private sector and voluntary sector organisations.

In the 2010 BBC licence fee settlement, the BBC agreed to take on the government&#x27;s funding of BBC Monitoring from 2013/2014, finding the £25 million required from the licence fee.

Reported on BBC News (17 January 2011), BBC Monitoring cut 72 posts following a £3 million cut in funding over the next two years. Director of BBC Monitoring, Chris Westcott, said: &quot;Regrettably service cuts and post closures are inevitable given the scale of the cut in funding.&quot;

The proposal was to cut £3m from the service&#x27;s costs by closing the 72 posts — about 16% of its staff — but expected to create 18 new posts. The BBC agreed to finance Monitoring from 2013/14 as part of the 2010 licence fee settlement which froze the annual colour licence fee at £145.50 for six years. The agreement also saw the corporation agree to take over the Foreign Office-funded World Service from 2014.

The House of Commons Foreign Affairs and Defence Committees strongly condemned the gradual scaling down of BBC Monitoring&#x27;s capabilities in two separate reports published in late 2016. The reports claimed that BBC Monitoring&#x27;s operations have been adversely affected by cuts. Both Committees demanded proper funding to ensure BBC Monitoring&#x27;s future.

==Leadership==
BBC Monitoring has been led by the following directors: 

* Liz Howell has served as director since March 2019
* Sara Beck served as the director from February 2016
* Lucio Mesquita served as director until 2016
* Chris Westcott served as director from April 2003 to March 2015.
* Andrew Hills served as director from 1996 to 2003

<text>Penn Masala is an American a cappella group. It is the world&#x27;s first and premier South Asian a cappella group. Formed in 1996 by students at the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Masala&#x27;s music has been influenced by the Eastern and Western cultures that represent the group&#x27;s membership. The group was featured on the soundtrack of &quot;American Desi&quot;, and has released twelve full-length albums: &quot;Awaaz&quot;, &quot;11 PM&quot;, &quot;Soundcheck&quot;, &quot;The Brown Album&quot;, &quot;Pehchaan&quot;, &quot;On Detours&quot;, &quot;Panoramic&quot;, &quot;Kaavish&quot;, &quot;Resonance&quot;,&quot;Yuva&quot;, &quot;Musafir&quot;, &quot;Midnight Oil,&quot; an EP titled &quot;Vol. 1&quot; and the compilation album &quot;Out of Stock&quot;. The group has performed at the White House (in October 2009 via invitation of Barack Obama and June 2023 via invitation from Joe Biden). 

Penn Masala has also performed for the Indian Filmfare Awards, and for prominent leaders including Henry Kissinger, Ban Ki-moon, Mukesh Ambani, and Narendra Modi. The group also had a cameo role in Pitch Perfect 2, released in May 2015.

==History==
Penn Masala, often stylized as pennmasala, was formed in 1996 by students at the University of Pennsylvania who wanted to represent their subcontinental heritage and music through a cappella singing. Among other, more long-standing a cappella groups, Penn Masala stood out as the only one in the world that sang Hindi music. This defining characteristic of the group brought it immediate attention as members fused Hindi and English music in original song formats. Soon, the group began to bill itself as &quot;The world&#x27;s first and premier Hindi a cappella group&quot;. Within just four years of its inception, Penn Masala had gained close to 15 members. By 2002, the group released its first two CDs: &quot;Awaaz&quot; (Hindi for &quot;sound&quot;) was released in 1999, and &quot;11 PM&quot; was released in 2001. Over the next 3 years, Penn Masala released two more full-length albums, &quot;Soundcheck&quot; and &quot;The Brown Album&quot;, and a compilation CD entitled &quot;Out of Stock&quot;, which included favorites from the first 3 albums. In 2007, the group released its fifth studio album, &quot;Pehchaan&quot; (Hindi for &quot;identity&quot;). The group followed up the success of &quot;Pehchaan&quot; with their sixth album, &quot;On Detours,&quot; which was released in March 2009 and &quot;Panoramic&quot;, released in 2011. In 2013, they released their eighth studio album titled &quot;Kaavish&quot;, which features the hit single &quot;Fix You / Ishq Bina&quot;. In March 2014, Penn Masala released The Evolution of Bollywood Music video, which has since received over 1 million views on YouTube. They were invited to perform at the 2014 IIFA Awards as a result of the media attention they subsequently received. In the fall of 2014, Penn Masala released a music video for their cover of Manwa Laage from the movie &quot;Happy New Year&quot;, featuring prominent artist Jonita Gandhi. The track was selected to be on the &quot;Best of College A Cappella (BOCA)&quot; album in 2015. In March 2015, Penn Masala released The Bollywood Breakdown, a compilation of contemporary songs that combine elements of hip-hop with Bollywood music. In May 2015, Penn Masala released the music video for Tonight (I’m Lovin’ You) / Dilliwaali Girlfriend, a mix featured on their ninth album, &quot;Resonance&quot;. The group had a cameo role in Pitch Perfect 2, released in May 2015, as competitors to the Barden Bellas. The soundtrack for the movie included Penn Masala&#x27;s Hindi version of &quot;Any Way You Want It&quot;, and won the award for the Best Soundtrack at the American Music Awards in 2015. Their tenth studio album, &quot;Yuva&quot;, was released in 2017. An EP, &quot;Vol. 1&quot;, was released in 2018, their eleventh album, &quot;Musafir&quot;, was released in 2020, and their twelfth and most recent album, &quot;Midnight Oil&quot;, was released in 2022. In 2023, President Joe Biden invited them to the White House; they sang &quot;Chaiya Chaiya&quot; for Prime Minister Modi when Modi visited the United States in June of that year. Eminent dignitaries were also there at the state dinner that day including tech leaders such as Sundar Pichai (who later congratulated them on the occasion), Tim Cook, Satya Nadella, and Raj Subramaniam; and musicians such as the violinist, Joshua Bell, who shook hands with all the members.

==Performances==
Penn Masala performs around the world, with much of their traveling done in the United States; the group performs at numerous universities and events across the world, spanning cities from Kolkata to London to Montreal and San Francisco.

In 1998, soon after the release of &quot;Awaaz&quot;, Penn Masala went on its first international tour to the United Kingdom, hitting the airwaves and performing all across the United Kingdom. The group gave two particularly noteworthy concerts in New York City: once in 2000 at the Zee Gold Bollywood Awards in the Nassau Coliseum, and again in 2002 at the Bollywood Music Awards in the Hammerstein Ballroom.

==India tours==

The group has travelled to India multiple times. In 2002, the group travelled to Mumbai, India to perform at the Star Screen Awards, during which time the members appeared on MTV Asia. In 2006, the group celebrated its 10th anniversary with a tour of India. The men performed at such venues as the National Centre for the Performing Arts at Nariman Point in Mumbai and Swabhumi in Kolkata. In January 2010, the group did another tour across India, selling out the Hard Rock Cafes in New Delhi and Mumbai. Penn Masala also performed at the Oberoi Trident at a ceremony honoring the achievements of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani. Present were many notable personalities, including Nita Ambani, director Rajkumar Hirani, director/producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra, former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Farooq Abdullah, actors Imran Khan, Rahul Bose and Vinod Khanna, and cricketer Sachin Tendulkar among others. The group also performed at the well-known Lumbini Park Amphitheatre in Hyderabad, and were featured in numerous media outlets, including NDTV, CNBC TV 18, BBC Asia, &quot;The Hindustan Times&quot;, Zee TV, and CNN-IBN among others. Penn Masala&#x27;s fourth India tour took place in January 2013, where they shot a music video of &quot;Fix You / Ishq Bina&quot; and performed in five cities across all of the Hard Rock Cafes in the entire country. The January 2013 tour was covered by many major India new outlets, including &quot;The Times of India&quot; and &quot;DNA India&quot;, who met with members Ram Narayan and Sam Levenson to write about the tour. Their most recent tour to India was in May 2023.
==United Kingdom and Canada tours==

After its initial United Kingdom tour, Penn Masala continued reaching out to audiences abroad with a tour of the nation in March 2010. Among others, two notable performances were at St. James Piccadilly in central London, and in Hammersmith, where the group headlined a nationwide music competition. In November 2010 Penn Masala performed in Montreal, their first Canadian performance in ten years. Then again in 2012, Penn Masala toured the United Kingdom and did a show for The Rajasthani Foundation&#x27;s Diwali Charity Gala Ball. Audience members included the Hinduja Brothers of the Hinduja Group, Lakshmi Narayan Mittal, Europe&#x27;s richest man and CEO of ArcelorMittal, as well as the company&#x27;s CFO Aditya Mittal. The group performed in the United Kingdom in October 2018 as well.

==Domestic tours==
Every semester, Penn Masala tours at a few university campuses. For example, in 2011, Penn Masala performed full-length shows at University of Michigan, Vanderbilt University, Ohio University, University of Houston, Rutgers University, Philadelphia Museum of Art, University of North Carolina, University of Maryland and a second performance at Rutgers University, as well as an international gig in the United Kingdom. The group performed at Southern Methodist University for Bhangra Blitz in April 2013. However, on top of these routine performances, Penn Masala has also performed for a number of famous individuals ranging from Anderson Cooper to Henry Kissinger to Ban Ki-moon.

On October 14, 2009, Penn Masala performed at the White House in Washington, D.C. for the White House&#x27;s celebration of Diwali and the signing ceremony of the Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The event took place in the East Room, with attendees including President Barack Obama, the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Education, Associate Director of Public Engagement Kalpen Modi (also known as Kal Penn), members of Congress, and distinguished community members. Penn Masala opened the ceremony with a performance which was followed by a speech by President Obama, who commended their creative energy and contributions to the Asian American community. In fact in 2012, it was leaked that along with artists such as Jay-Z, Adam Levine, Fergie, Arcade Fire and others, Penn Masala was to be courted by President Barack Obama&#x27;s team in order to obtain their celebrity endorsement. In 2011, Penn Masala was invited to perform for the presidents of universities all over the world as well as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Penn Masala also holds a large annual spring concert at the University of Pennsylvania in the university&#x27;s largest performance venue, Irvine Auditorium. The concert features a wide selection of their songs, and incorporates humor throughout the show using skits and videos that often parody or spoof popular culture. The end of the show is usually marked by a traditional gathering of Masala alumni and current members of the group on stage to commemorate the group and its extensive alumni network

==Music==
Penn Masala combines various musical traditions, including Hindi film music, pop, hip-hop, R&amp;B, rock, and Indian classical styles. The group also uses a wide array of languages in their songs. Their compositions are primarily sung in English or Hindi, but certain songs include Arabic, Punjabi, Kannada, and Tamil as well.

Penn Masala blends popular songs to create its own independent version, which is melodically and thematically unified. Most songs fuse popular Hindi and English songs (in the past the group has covered songs by artists such as U2 and Justin Timberlake), into an a cappella rendition. Some songs are purely Hindi; for example, &quot;Bahara&quot; on &quot;Panoramic&quot;, and &quot;Yeh Honsla&quot; on &quot;On Detours&quot; and others purely English, such as &quot;What Goes Around Comes Around&quot; on &quot;On Detours&quot;. Other songs, such as &quot;Aicha&quot; and &quot;Is Pal Mein&quot;, incorporate Hindi and English lyrics into a single song. &quot;Aankhon Mein Tu Hai&quot; also includes Tamil verses, &quot;Saade Dil Te&quot;, &quot;Kangna&quot; and &quot;Tere Werga&quot; incorporate Punjabi songs, while &quot;Masala Dosa&quot; begins with the Kannada hymn &quot;Krishna Ni Begane&quot;, &quot;Aicha&quot; includes Arabic verses and &quot;Fix You - Ishq Bina&quot; includes Bengali. While most of the group&#x27;s songs are interpretations of already-existing songs, the group also composes originals (one or two per album), such as &quot;Main Tanha&quot; and &quot;Pehchaan&quot; on the album &quot;Pehchaan&quot;, &quot;Kal Ka Sapna&quot; and &quot;Distant Places&quot; on &quot;On Detours&quot;, &quot;Is Pal Mein&quot; and &quot;Kaash&quot; on &quot;Panoramic&quot;, &quot;Mann Mein Ujaala&quot; on &quot;Kaavish,&quot; &quot;Reflection (In Your Eyes)&quot; on &quot;Resonance,&quot; &quot;Ishaara&quot; on &quot;Yuva&quot; and &quot;Meant To Be/Chalta Raha&quot; on &quot;Musafir&quot;.

Penn Masala&#x27;s music has been popularly and critically acclaimed. &quot;Meri Sapno Ki Rani&quot; and &quot;Aap Jaise Koi&quot; were both featured in &quot;American Desi&quot;, while a music video for &quot;Chamak Challo&quot; debuted in the Top 10 on Channel [V] India. Both &quot;Chamak Challo&quot; and &quot;Bharat Humko Jaan Se Pyara Hai&quot;, a celebration of India&#x27;s 50th anniversary of independence, brought immediate attention to the group in the fall of 1997, and have been fan favorites ever since. Penn Masala songs have been routinely selected for Varsity Vocals&#x27; &quot;Best of Collegiate A Cappella&quot; CD. &quot;Bharat Humko Jaan Se Pyara Hai&quot; was the first Penn Masala song to be honored. After that, &quot; &quot;Pehchaan&quot; from &quot;Pehchaan&quot;, &quot;Lovestoned/Ya Ali&quot; from &quot;On Detours&quot;, &quot;Is Pal Mein&quot; from &quot;Panoramic&quot;, and &quot;Manwa Laage&quot; from &quot;Resonance&quot; have all been selected to be on the &quot;Best of Collegiate A Cappella&quot; CD for their respective years.

In 2012, the group was named one of the five best college a cappella groups in the United States by &quot;USA Today&quot; and twelve best college a cappella groups by online magazine &quot;Her Campus&quot;.

==Members==
Penn Masala is a living, evolving group. Made up of University of Pennsylvania students, the group&#x27;s membership constantly changes as veteran members graduate and new members enter the group through an audition process. Although the majority of Penn Masala&#x27;s members are of Indian descent, non-Indian members such as Brian Hong, Sam Levenson, Brendan McManus, and Albert Gu have been a part of the group. Former members also occasionally perform with the group when they tour different cities.

Penn Masala currently consists of: Ajay Kilambi, Prateek Adurty, Raghunandan Raman, Aryaman Meswani, Gaurish Gaur, Avik Agarwal, Sauman Das, Aadi Shah, Ram Pantula.

===Alumni===

The group also gives special thanks to the following: Santosh Govindaraju, Siddhartha Khosla, Swapnil Shah, Sameer Mungur, Ananda Sen, Vishal Oberoi

<doc id="375618" wikidata="Q5103158" url="?curid=375618" title="Chloroplast membrane">
<text>Chloroplasts contain several important membranes, vital for their function. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have a double-membrane envelope, called the chloroplast envelope, but unlike mitochondria, chloroplasts also have internal membrane structures called [[thylakoid]]s. Furthermore, one or two additional membranes may enclose chloroplasts in organisms that underwent secondary endosymbiosis, such as the euglenids and chlorarachniophytes.

The chloroplasts come via endosymbiosis by engulfment of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium by the eukaryotic, already mitochondriate cell. Over millions of years the endosymbiotic cyanobacterium evolved structurally and functionally, retaining its own DNA and the ability to divide by binary fission (not mitotically) but giving up its autonomy by the transfer of some of its genes to the nuclear genome.

==Envelope membranes==
Each of the envelope membranes is a lipid bilayer that is between 6 and 8 nm thick. The lipid composition of the outer membrane has been found to be 48% phospholipids, 46% galactolipids and 7% sulfolipids, while the inner membrane has been found to contain 16% phospholipids, 79% galactolipids and 5% sulfolipids in spinach chloroplasts.

The outer membrane is permeable to most ions and metabolites, but the inner membrane of the chloroplast is highly specialised with transport proteins. For example, carbohydrates are transported across the inner envelope membrane by a triose phosphate translocator. The two envelope membranes are separated by a gap of 10–20 nm, called the intermembrane space.

==Thylakoid membrane==
Within the envelope membranes, in the region called the stroma, there is a system of interconnecting flattened membrane compartments, called the thylakoids. The thylakoid membrane is quite similar in lipid composition to the inner envelope membrane, containing 78% galactolipids, 15.5% phospholipids and 6.5% sulfolipids in spinach chloroplasts. The thylakoid membrane encloses a single, continuous aqueous compartment called the thylakoid lumen.

These are the sites of light absorption and ATP synthesis, and contain many proteins, including those involved in the electron transport chain. Photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophylls a,b,c and some others, e.g., xanthophylls, carotenoids, phycobilins are also embedded within the granum membrane. With exception of chlorophyll a, all the other associated pigments are &quot;accessory&quot; and transfer energy to the reaction centers of Photosytems I and II.

The membranes of the thylakoid contain photosystems I and II which harvest solar energy to excite electrons which travel down the electron transport chain. This exergonic fall in potential energy along the way is used to draw (not pump!) H+ ions from the lumen of the thylakoid into the cytosol of a cyanobacterium or the stroma of a chloroplast. A steep H+ gradient is formed, which allows chemiosmosis to occur, where the thylakoid, transmembrane ATP-synthase serves a dual function as a &quot;gate&quot; or channel for H+ ions and a catalytic site for the formation of ATP from ADP + a PO43− ion.

Experiments have shown that the pH within the stroma is about 7.8, while that of the lumen of the thylakoid is 5. This corresponds to a six-hundredfold difference in concentration of H+ ions. The H+ ions pass down through the ATP-synthase catalytic gate. This chemiosmotic phenomenon also occurs in mitochondria.

<text>The Honourable Company of Master Mariners is one of the livery companies of the City of London. While the other livery companies are entitled to the style &quot;Worshipful&quot;, the Master Mariners are styled &quot;Honourable&quot;, King George V having granted them that honour in 1928.

The Company aids nautical schools and promotes nautical research. Members meet regularly to socialise, discuss technical issues and assist with the mentoring and training of young officers, who will train at sea to reach master mariner status.

The Honourable Company ranks seventy-eighth in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Loyalty and Service&quot;. The organisation nominally has the right to allow two of its Masters to serve as nautical assessors in the Admiralty Court.

The company works with other industry organisations such as the International Federation of Shipmasters&#x27; Associations. This includes the organisations of lectures and command seminars.

==History==
The company was formed and incorporated in 1926. In February 1928, His Royal Highness, Edward, Prince of Wales was elected Master of the company. The company was made an official Livery Company by the City of London in 1932, making it the first new Livery Company to be formed since 1746.

In February 1952 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II became royal patron of the company. In June 1954, His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was made a Master of the company.

From 2005 to 2007, Her Royal Highness Anne, Princess Royal served as Master of the company.

==HQS &quot;Wellington&quot;==

Between 1948 and 2023, instead of the usual livery hall, the Honourable Company of Master Mariners had a headquarters ship, HQS &quot;Wellington&quot;, moored on the Thames at Victoria Embankment. The Company purchased the sloop from the Admiralty in 1947 following donations from their members. She was subsequently converted for use as a floating livery hall in Chatham Dockyard. The conversion was paid for by donations from Lloyd&#x27;s of London, private benefactors, shipping companies and other livery companies. In December 1948, the ship was moved to her permanent mooring along the Victoria Embankment. In 1991, the ship was extensively refurbished following a period of dry-docking in the private yards at Sheerness Dockyard. 

In July 2005, ownership of HQS &quot;Wellington&quot; was transferred from the Honourable Company to a new organisation, the Wellington Trust, although the company retained its home onboard and was largely responsible for leadership within the trust. On 6 April 2023, it was announced that, due to safety concerns, the Honourable Company would leave the ship, though they were developing plans for a new floating livery hall.

On display on the ship was the steering wheel of the ship &quot;Otago&quot;, the Master Joseph Conrad having sailed on the &quot;Otago&quot;. Following her destruction in 1931, the wheel was presented to the Honourable Company.

<text>The Dutch public broadcasting system () is a group of organizations that are responsible for public service television and radio broadcasting in the Netherlands. It is composed of the Nederlandse Publieke Omroep (NPO) foundation, which acts as its governing body, and a number of public broadcasters. The Dutch Media Act 2008 regulates how air time is divided and puts the administration of the public broadcasting system in the hands of the NPO Board of Directors.

In addition to the national broadcasters, there are also regional and local broadcasters in the Netherlands.

Unlike most other countries&#x27; public broadcasting organizations – which are either national corporations (such as the BBC and France Télévisions / Radio France), federations of regional public-law bodies (for example, ARD, SRG SSR) or governmental and member-based institutions with their own channels and facilities (such as PBS) – those in the Netherlands are member-based broadcasting associations that share common facilities. This arrangement has its origins in the system developed in the Netherlands early in the 20th century, known as &quot;pillarisation&quot;. Under this system the different religious and political streams of Dutch society (Catholics, Protestants, socialists, etc.) all have their own separate associations, newspapers, sports clubs, educational institutions, and also broadcasting organizations.

Their stated aim is to give a voice to each social group in multicultural Dutch society. The number of hours allocated to each broadcaster corresponds roughly to the number of members each organization can recruit (although this does not apply to NOS and NTR – see below). Since 2000, the system has been financed out of general taxation rather than from broadcast receiver licence fees. This is supplemented by a limited amount of on-air advertising (provided by STER), which has been allowed since 1967.

Nearly all viewers in the Netherlands receive most of their linear TV via cable, IPTV (DSL or fiber) or satellite systems. Regional public TV exists in parallel to the national system described below. Commercial television in the Netherlands began in 1989, with the Luxembourg-based RTL 4. In 1992, the government of the Netherlands legalised commercial TV, and many new commercial channels have become established since then.

==Finance==
Every year, the Dutch public broadcasting system is allocated funds from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. In 2018 the allocation was 794 million Euro with yearly revenues from advertising averaging around 200 million Euro. 
The cost to each adult Dutch citizen is approximately 45 Euro per year, which is on a similar level to VRT in Flemish Belgium (46 Euro). In comparison, the BBC in the United Kingdom gets its revenue from an annual household licence fee of 159 GBP, approx 188 Euro. As of 2020, the BBC&#x27;s average annual licence fee income is 3.7 Billion GBP and the UK adult population is about 53 million (total population is 68 million), so the average cost per person is about 70 GBP.

==History==

===The closed system (1920–1960)===
Since the very beginning in the early 1920s, public broadcasting in the Netherlands has been split into different broadcasting associations with their members composed of listeners and viewers. These associations were based on the different ideological sections of Dutch society, called &quot;Verzuiling&quot; (pillarisation). Catholics, Protestants and Socialists were the first groups to create their own institutions, including schools, hospitals, trades unions and political parties. When radio in the Netherlands started in the 1920s the existing groups quickly created their own broadcasting associations, producing programmes for the primary radio network, &quot;Hilversum 1&quot;. The first to start was the liberal AVRO, founded as radio broadcaster Hilversumsche Draadlooze Omroep (HDO) by the NSF transmitter factory in Huizen on 8 July 1923. The first regular radio broadcasts started on 21 July 1923. Airtime was rented to the various religious and political radio organisations—the Protestant NCRV, the Roman Catholic KRO, the Socialist VARA and the liberal Protestant VPRO.

Under the system of pillarisation in place at the time, each audience group was faithful to its pillar&#x27;s broadcasting company. The programmes were funded by the associations&#x27; members. KRO and NCRV started their own station in 1927 with a transmitter also located in Huizen and built by the NSF.

In 1930 the government regulated equal airtime for all organisations on the two stations, and the semi-public broadcasting system was born. As a result, AVRO lost most of its airtime then (50%) to VARA and VPRO.

The radio licence fee was introduced by the Nazi occupation during World War II; the different broadcasting groups were urged by the Government to co-operate more with each other, and the &quot;Netherlands Radio Union&quot; () was formed, producing joint programmes.

The Netherlands Radio Union was one of 23 founding organisations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) in 1950. (The role of the Dutch representative to the European Broadcasting Union was later inherited by NOS, formed in 1969, and has since September 2002 been the responsibility of NPO.)

1951 saw the introduction of television, and a similar union was founded: the (), supplying studios and facilities for the associations. These broadcasts would air on the Nederland 1 channel; a second channel, Nederland 2, was launched in 1964.

===The closed system opens up (1960–1990)===

With the arrival of illegal offshore commercial radio stations, such as Radio Veronica in 1960 and Radio Noordzee in 1964, Hilversum 3 was launched in 1965 to provide a legal alternative and to steer audiences towards the public service channels. &quot;Hilversum 3&quot;, along with the other two networks, were renamed as Radio 1, Radio 2 and Radio 3 towards the late 1980s.

In 1967 a Broadcasting Act was passed, providing for an official framework to supply the public with information, entertainment, culture and education, with time allocated to appointed broadcasting associations based on the number of members each association had. This allowed other organisations access to the public system, including the former commercial unlicensed broadcasters TROS and Veronica and the evangelical Christian EO to diversify programming. Advertising revenue was added, handled by an independent agency called STER.

The Netherlands Radio Union (NRU) and the Netherlands Television Foundation (NTS) merged to form the NOS, charged with providing news and sport programmes as well as with the general coordination of the public system.

A new Media Act in 1988 meant that broadcasters were no longer obliged to use production facilities supplied by the NOS. These facilities were spun off into a new private company, NOB. Programme quotas were introduced: Associations had to produce:
* 25% news and information programmes
* 25% entertainment and general programming
* 20% cultural
* 5% educational

A new media regulator (&quot;&quot;) was created to regulate the public and private networks. The regulator could impose fines, with a programming fund designed to encourage cultural broadcasts. New rules for the cable industry were also introduced: the public networks were designated must-carry status.

===The start of private media (1990–2000)===
In anticipation of the launch of new commercial satellite channels, a third television network, Nederland 3, launched in April 1988. Luxembourg-based RTL-Véronique began broadcasting in October 1989. In 1992, the government of the Netherlands legalised commercial television, and a number of new commercial channels were established. As a result, the market share of public television had fallen from 85% to 50% by 1994. Veronica decided to leave the public system after 20 years to become a commercial broadcaster. By 1996 the arrival of more private channels from RTL and SBS had further reduced the market share of the public networks to 40%.

With the change in the television landscape, changes were made to strengthen the public sector. Its financial revenues were improved by an increase in advertising time and the indexation of the licence fee to the cost of living.
In 1995 the programming duties of the Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (Netherlands Broadcasting Foundation, NOS) were split in two, with the creation of the NPS (Netherlands Programming Foundation). NOS was charged with providing news, sport and coverage of important live events, while the NPS provided cultural and children&#x27;s programming.

The previous NOS management was replaced by a three-person board, charged with developing strategies and responsibility for all public output. Programming co-ordinators were appointed for each of the television and radio networks, and channel identities were created, largely replacing the varying on-air presentation of the pillar broadcasters. The broadcasting associations also have a degree of input through a supervisory board.

The market share of the public networks stabilized in 1999 at 38%, with the entry of a new broadcasting association, the first in 25 years. BNN (&quot;Bart&#x27;s News Network&quot;, later &quot;Bart&#x27;s Neverending Network&quot;) replaced Veronica as programme supplier to teenagers and young adults.

===Diversification, expansion and the creation of the NPO (2000–2010)===
Under the newer &quot;open system&quot; any company can become a broadcasting company and obtain radio and TV airtime. As of 2024, the primary requirements set out in the require that new broadcasters provide additional diversity to the public broadcasting system, and that all associations attain - and continue to maintain - a certain number of members (currently 100,000; provisional status may be granted with 50,000 members). Such recruitment can be compared with that used for community or public broadcasting in other countries, with incentives such as magazines or other offers provided by some associations to attract membership.

Many people question whether the current system is still appropriate in this age of digital broadcasting. There were plans in the run-up to the 2002 general election to change the way broadcast companies are selected, and to abolish the member-based system completely. Vocal critics included Pim Fortuyn, the assassinated leader of his own right-wing party. However, currently the system is still the way it always has been.

Prior to the 2002 reorganization, the Dutch public broadcasting system was managed by NOS. In 2002, it was put under control of &quot;Nederlandse Publieke Omroep&quot; (Dutch Public Broadcasting foundation), abbreviated as NPO. According to Articles 2.2 and 2.19 of the Media Act, NPO was appointed as the governing organization of the public broadcasting system of the Netherlands until 2020; this concession was later extended until the end of 2031.

From September 2010, Minister of Culture and Education Ronald Plasterk approved the entry of new broadcasting associations PowNed and Wakker Nederland (WNL) into the public broadcasting system. Another association, MAX, was given full recognition and can increase its broadcasting hours. Conversely, LLiNK was withdrawn and no longer has access. Meanwhile, the NPS, Teleac and the RVU institutions merged into one public broadcaster, the NTR, delivering cultural, educational, current affairs and children&#x27;s programmes to the public system.

===Cuts to the public system (2010–present)===
On 18 January 2010, , chairman of the NPO Management Board, announced a scaling back of the number of broadcasting associations using the public airwaves to 15 by 2015. He also warned of the threat of political parties which could influence programming in the public broadcasting system.

In September 2010 cuts to the public system took effect, with the existing eleven full-time broadcasting associations facing decisions about their futures. Part-time Islamic broadcasters NMO, NIO and the merged SMON were all withdrawn from the public system.

In March 2012, NPO announced the closure of two of its digital television channels, Geschiedenis 24 (&quot;History 24&quot;) and Consumenten 24 (&quot;Consumer 24&quot;) on 1 April. History programmes transferred to Holland Doc 24 and consumer programmes are looked after by VARA via an online portal.

====Future plans (from 2016)====
From 2015, Netherlands Public Broadcasting will face a budget shortfall of 200 million euro. To address this, the number of broadcasting associations within the public system is to be reduced. Mergers and/or cooperations have been confirmed between existing broadcasting associations:

==List of broadcasters==

===Member based===
There are currently eleven member-based broadcasting associations:
* AVROTROS &quot;(Algemene Vereniging Radio Omroep - Televisie en Radio Omroep Stichting)&quot; (): A merger between the oldest broadcaster in the system and the most popular general broadcaster, its mission emphasizes its liberal roots by &quot;promoting freedom&quot; and with a focus on entertainment. AVRO was founded as HDO in the 1923. TROS originated from a commercial unlicensed TV station, and was known for platforming Dutch popular music and promoting Dutch artists. From 2010, it took charge of the Dutch participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, until the merger of AVRO and TROS into AVROTROS in September 2014.
* BNNVARA &quot;(Bart&#x27;s Neverending Network&quot; and &quot;Vereniging van Arbeiders Radio Amateurs)&quot; (): BNN is founded by Bart de Graaff, with its programming primarily aimed at a younger audience, often dealing with pop culture and shock value.

<text>Peter George Sissons (17 July 1942 – 1 October 2019) was an English journalist and broadcaster. He was a newscaster for ITN, providing bulletins on ITV and Channel 4, before becoming the presenter of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; between 1989 and 1993, and a presenter of the &quot;BBC Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; between 1993 and 2003. He retired from the BBC in 2009 and died in 2019 from leukaemia at the age of 77.

==Early life==
Born at Smithdown Road Hospital in Liverpool on 17 July 1942, Sissons was the third of four brothers, sons of Merchant Navy officer George Robert Percival Sissons and his wife Elsie Emma (Evans), an employee in a department store. He attended Dovedale Junior School with John Lennon and Jimmy Tarbuck, passed the eleven-plus and attended the Liverpool Institute for Boys from 1953 to 1961 with the theatre producer Bill Kenwright, the politician Steven Norris, and George Harrison and Paul McCartney from the Beatles.

He studied philosophy, politics and economics at University College, Oxford, where he was treasurer of the University College Players, with whom he also acted, produced, directed and organised.

==Career==
===ITN===
Sissons joined ITN in 1964, working his way up to the role of journalist. He was wounded by gunfire whilst covering the Biafran War in 1968, sustaining severe nerve damage in his left leg. After recovering from his injuries, he became ITN&#x27;s Industrial Editor, covering many high-profile disputes during the 1970s. On 6 September 1976, Sissons joined the list of presenters of ITN&#x27;s lunchtime &quot;News at One&quot; bulletin, alternating with Leonard Parkin. He also co-presented ITN&#x27;s coverage of the 1983 general election with Sir Alastair Burnet and Martyn Lewis, and again in 1987 with Burnet and Alastair Stewart.

In 1982, Sissons, along with Trevor McDonald and Sarah Hogg, presented the first edition of Channel 4 News. He remained on the programme for seven years, anchoring the only debate between National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill and National Coal Board leader Ian MacGregor during the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike. He was also the presenter on the night of the Lockerbie bombing in December 1988. In early 1989, Sissons received a death threat following his interview of an Iranian representative as part of the reaction surrounding the publication of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, with the fatwa covering Salman Rushdie extended to cover him as well.

Sissons left ITN in 1989 to join the BBC.

===BBC===
In June 1989, Sissons took over from Sir Robin Day as the presenter of &quot;Question Time&quot;. He continued until December 1993, when he was succeeded by David Dimbleby. He co-presented the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the 1992 general election with Dimbleby and Peter Snow.

From 1993, and for some years afterwards, he hosted Breakfast with Frost on Sunday mornings when regular host David Frost was unavailable.

Between 1989 and 1994, he co-hosted the &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; after which he moved to present &quot;BBC Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot; and he stayed with the programme when it became &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. He was dropped from this position in January 2003. Sissons reportedly accused the BBC of ageism in response to its decision to remove him from the bulletin.

In 2002, Sissons announced the death of the Queen Mother on the BBC. This broadcast created controversy and criticism from some newspapers as he wore a burgundy tie and not a black one, deemed more appropriate for such news. He later defended his choice and a senior BBC source said: &quot;We thought if the newsreader suddenly rushed off screen to change into a black tie for the announcement it would be a distraction for viewers.&quot;

Sissons subsequently presented weekend afternoons on BBC News 24, the corporation&#x27;s rolling news channel, although until 2004 he still occasionally appeared on the &quot;Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot; when Huw Edwards, Fiona Bruce and Darren Jordon were unavailable. Sissons also presented &quot;News 24 Sunday&quot;, the replacement for Andrew Marr&#x27;s BBC One programme &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot; when it was off air during the summer. He also occasionally presented weekend bulletins on BBC One.

He retired from the BBC in 2009, announcing on 12 June his intention to retire in the summer in order to write his memoirs.

Sissons cited a 2009 interview he conducted with Harriet Harman as the final catalyst for his decision to leave the BBC. He noted how producers seemed &quot;twitchy&quot; about leaving him to interview the Labour politician unsupervised, and that those producers contacting him with advice &quot;seemed to be fully paid-up members of her fan club.&quot; Sissons noted his shock at being urged not to raise the issue of a breaking controversy surrounding Gordon Brown failing to invite the Queen to a D-Day commemoration event, because it was &quot;only a campaign being run by the Daily Mail&quot;. He asked the question anyhow, and upon arriving home afterwards decided he no longer wished to work for the organisation.

==Autobiography==
Following his retirement, Sissons published his 2011 autobiography &quot;When One Door Closes&quot;, in which he was highly critical of his former employer, the BBC. He argued that the organisation had a left-wing mindset &quot;in its very DNA&quot; and that BBC News had a bias towards New Labour, the United Nations, the European Union, environmental groups, Islam, ethnic minorities, and women. He wrote, &quot;I am in no doubt that the majority of BBC staff vote for political parties of the Left&quot;. Sissons also highlighted the BBC&#x27;s corresponding bias towards the &quot;Independent&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot; newspapers, stating &quot;producers refer to them routinely for the line to take on running stories, and for inspiration on which items to cover.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sissons married his wife Sylvia () at All Saints, Stoneycroft on 24 July 1965. They had three children, one of whom, Kate Sissons, is an actress. Sissons and his wife lived in Sevenoaks, Kent, and had a second home on the island of Barbados.

Sissons was a Liverpool John Moores University Honorary Fellow and delivered a lecture on 19 June 2008 speaking about the city of Liverpool. He was a lifelong supporter of Liverpool Football Club.

==Death==
Sissons died at the age of 77 on 1 October 2019 at the Maidstone Hospital in Kent from leukaemia. The Director-General of the BBC, Lord Hall of Birkenhead, hailed him as &quot;one of the great television figures of his time&quot;. Other tributes to Sissons were paid by Huw Edwards, Tony Blair, Piers Morgan, Simon McCoy and Jon Snow. Sissons&#x27; former classmate Paul McCartney posted a tribute on his website. There was a funeral service for Sissons at St Nicholas Church, Sevenoaks on 18 October.

<text>&quot;French Colonies&quot; is the name used by philatelists to refer to the postage stamps issued by France for use in the parts of the French colonial empire that did not have stamps of their own. These were in use from 1859 to 1906, and from 1943 to 1945.

==First stamps==

The first of these were small square stamps issued in 1859, depicting an eagle and crown in a round frame, with the inscription &quot;COLONIES DE L&#x27;EMPIRE FRANCAIS&quot;. They were imperforate (as were all Colonies stamps until 1881). A total of six values, 1c to 80c, appeared between 1859 and 1865.

==Ceres==

The next series appeared in 1871 and 1872, and borrowed the contemporaneous designs of France, with profiles of Ceres and Emperor Napoleon III. While some of the nine values can be distinguished from the French stamps by color or value, others are extremely difficult to identify.

Several of an additional series of Ceres heads issued between 1872 and 1877 have a similar problem, and are distinguishable only by being imperforate, as was the Colonies part of the Peace and Commerce issue (Type Sage) of 1877 to 1880.
==Commerce series==
In 1881, a new series, featuring &quot;Commerce&quot; alone and inscribed &quot;COLONIES&quot;, was issued, perforated 14x13.5. The 13 values, ranging from 1c to 1fr, were in colors comparable to those used for France. In 1886 the 25c stamp, previously printed in yellow, was reissued in black on a rose-colored paper. Stocks of the Commerce issue were frequently overprinted by the colonies during the 1880s and 1890s.

==Navigation &amp; Commerce series==

France began issuing stamps printed with the territory name in 1892 as part of the Navigation and Commerce issue.

A series of common postage due stamps was issued beginning in 1884, with a last one appearing in 1906. Thereafter each colony used only its own stamps.

==World War II==
The concept was revived by the Free French forces during World War II, who printed eight types of semi-postal stamps in 1943 and 1944. After the Free French landed in Corsica and Southern France, the stamps were used in those areas, and became valid throughout France in November 1944.

Finally, in 1945 a general issue of postage due stamps for the colonies was produced.

==Postal stationery==
Various items of postal stationery, in addition to postage stamps, were also produced for general issue to the French Colonies. A total of three postcards were issued in 1876, followed by two different cards in 1880 and two in 1885. One reply postcard was issued in 1885. Six different letter cards were issued in 1885 and two in 1890. Two postal stationery envelopes were produced and issued in 1889. Five different values of newspaper wrappers made available to the colonies in 1889.

<doc id="375634" wikidata="Q505474" url="?curid=375634" title="Jean-Louis Roux">
<text>Jean-Louis Roux (May 18, 1923 – November 28, 2013) was a Canadian politician, entertainer and playwright who was briefly the 26th Lieutenant Governor of Quebec.

==Biography==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, he originally studied medicine at the Université de Montréal, but gave it up to pursue acting. After travelling and performing in New York City and Paris he returned to Montreal and helped create the Théâtre du Nouveau Monde and became a frequent actor in and director of its productions for the next several years. He also turned to writing and wrote successful plays, radio dramas, and television shows.

His greatest fame comes from his role on &quot;La famille Plouffe&quot;, a very successful Quebec situation comedy. Roux served as President of the Canadian Conference of the Arts from 1968 through 1970.

==Public life and &quot;L’Affaire Jean-Louis Roux&quot;==

A staunch federalist, Jean-Louis Roux was appointed to the Senate by his longtime friend Jean Chrétien in 1994. During the 1995 Quebec referendum campaign, Roux was arguably the best-known personality in the area of art and culture to campaign for the &quot;no&quot;. His public statement that Quebec intellectuals should not remain passively on the sideline as German intellectuals had done during the rise of Nazism in their country provoked an uproar.

The following year, Prime Minister Chrétien appointed him as the new lieutenant governor of Quebec, a move that was seen as a provocation by many since it was customary to appoint to that ceremonial function uncontroversial figures who had never, or long ceased to be politically active. He resigned abruptly and spectacularly barely two months into his five-year mandate shortly after the publication of a cover story titled &quot;L&#x27;Affaire Jean-Louis Roux&quot; in the magazine L&#x27;Actualité on 1 November 1996. Adding to what former federal cabinet minister Gérard Pelletier had already disclosed to L&#x27;Actualité journalist Luc Chartrand regarding his longtime friend Jean-Louis Roux having drawn a swastika on the sleeve of this lab coat during his World War II medical school days, Roux revealed during his pre-publication interview with Chartrand that he had taken part, and had even been once in the front-line of anti-conscription protests in 1942 during which the windows of Jewish-owned stores had been smashed, and that he had even held pro-Mussolini, pro-Franco and pro-Pétain sympathies during those years. There were rapidly increasing calls coming from all quarters that he resign as lieutenant governor, which he did on 5 November. Jean Chrétien angrily accused &quot;the separatists&quot; of having engineered the whole thing in order to discredit a man of honour but Roux himself did not support that accusation and there was general agreement that it was Gérard Pelletier’s swastika leak during the L’Actualité interview that was at the origin of the scandal.

Roux tearfully told a news conference the day after his resignation that &quot;the carefree attitude of youth may be an explanation, but it can&#x27;t in any way serve as an excuse and especially not as a justification; I committed a mistake by yielding to the anti-Semitic feelings that poisoned our minds at the time.&quot;

==Chair of the Canada Council==

On May 31, 1997 Roux returned to public life when the federal government appointed him to be chair of the Canada Council.

In 1971 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was promoted to Companion in 1987. In 1989, he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. Roux received a Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for his lifetime contributions to Canadian theatre in 2004.

He died in Montreal on November 28, 2013.

<text>Blackheath is a town in the Sandwell Metropolitan Borough, in the county of West Midlands, England.

==History==
Before 1841, &quot;Bleak Heath&quot; or &quot;Blake Heath&quot; was a small group of farm houses and inns on the turnpike road from Oldbury to Halesowen, within Rowley Regis. The changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution led to a Private Act in June that year that allowed the sale of the Rowley Regis glebe lands in order to finance the building of a new vicarage.

The land was purchased by developers who, throughout the remainder of the 19th century, expanded &quot;Blackheath&quot; as a dormitory town for the surrounding industries, in particular, the coal mine at Coombes Wood and the Hailstone quarry. Workers migrated to Blackheath from across England and particularly from Wales until the town and its neighbours grew to form the existing conurbation with nearby Birmingham.

==Churches==
The parish of St Paul was established in 1865 as a distinct entity from that of Rowley Regis and the new church consecrated in 1869. There has also been a long tradition of nonconformism with many Methodist and Baptist chapels.

==Manufacturing, railways, and industrialisation==
A market was established and an extension of the Great Western Railway linking Birmingham and Worcester opened a in the town in 1867.

Into the 20th century, manufacturing grew and extractive industries declined with the last coal mine closing in 1919. Major employers were the fasteners business at the Excelsior Works of Thomas William Lench and the electrical engineering business of British Thomson-Houston (BTH). Manufacturing remained the main source of income up to the start of the 21st century with the BTH works still in operation though in the intervening years it has worked under the successive names of AEI, GEC, GEC-ALSTHOM, Hawker Siddeley, BTR and Electrodrives.

==Borough and county membership==
Blackheath was part of the borough of Rowley Regis until 1966, when it became part of the county borough of Warley. Since 1974 it has formed part of the metropolitan borough of Sandwell.

It was historically part of Staffordshire until 1966, when the boundaries were altered to incorporate the new borough of Warley into Worcestershire. Since 1974, it has been part of the West Midlands metropolitan county.

==Economy==
Blackheath has always been a predominantly working class area dominated by modest housing. The town was hard hit by the economic slow-down of the 1970s and unemployment of the early 1980s. However, in the 1990s the town became more prosperous with improving housing stock and some substantial development in town centre stores and improvement in the road network. A J Sainsbury supermarket opened in the town centre around this time.

Blackheath has many transport links with buses travelling throughout the borough and Rowley Regis railway station is nearby.

==Other information==
Blackheath Primary School is located in the area, and was originally built by Rowley Regis urban district council on Powke Lane during the late 19th century, incorporating a 5-7 infant school and 7-11 junior school and later including a nursery unit for 3 and 4 year olds. The schools merged in September 1990 to form Blackheath Primary School. It relocated to a site on Britannia Road, previously occupied by Britannia High School, in September 2005.

Football team Blackheath Town F.C. played in the West Midlands (Regional) League Division One (South) but are now just a youth development squad.

On 6 April 1959, the town was the scene of the first major racially motivated incident in the West Midlands when some 30 Teddy Boys clashed with a group of black people.

With rising traffic on local roads after the Second World War, Blackheath became a congestion hotspot. Things improved slightly with the construction of a new road around the north of the town centre towards the end of the 1970s, but this was only of use to traffic coming to and from Cradley Heath and Brierley Hill. Motorists travelling from Quinton still had to negotiate the original route that was little better than it had been in the days before cars. This problem was solved in 2006 with a new relief road that circles the eastern half of the town centre and diverts traffic coming from Halesowen, Quinton and Oldbury.

Blackheath has some of the strongest public transport links in the Black Country. It has direct bus and rail links with Birmingham, while the extensive bus network gives locals a direct route to Oldbury, Halesowen, Dudley, Cradley Heath, West Bromwich, Wolverhampton, Merry Hill Shopping Centre and Walsall.

*Glenn Tipton, guitarist with Judas Priest was born in Blackheath in 1947

<doc id="375641" wikidata="Q685575" url="?curid=375641" title="God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)">
<text>&quot;God Save the Queen&quot; is a song by the English punk rock band the Sex Pistols. It was released as the band&#x27;s second single and was later included on their only studio album, &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;. The song was released during Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1977.

The record&#x27;s lyrics, as well as the cover, were controversial at the time; both the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority refused to play the song, including a total ban of its airing by the BBC. The original title for the song was &quot;No Future&quot;, with the lyrics themselves being a general expression of the band&#x27;s view of the monarchy or any individual or establishment commanding general obligation.

The song reached No. 1 on the &quot;NME&quot; charts in the United Kingdom, and made it to No. 2 on the official UK Singles Chart as used by the BBC. This led to accusations by some that the charts had been &quot;fixed&quot; to prevent the song from reaching No. 1.

==Background==
The song&#x27;s title is taken directly from the British national anthem. At the time, the song was highly controversial for its equation of Queen Elizabeth with a &quot;fascist regime&quot; and for the lyric &quot;there is no future in England&#x27;s dreaming&quot;. According to Glen Matlock, who had co-written the song — although he was no longer a member of the band by the time it was released — the bass was inspired by the Move&#x27;s &quot;Fire Brigade&quot;. Guitarist Steve Jones stated that when Matlock first played him the song, it did not sound like &#x27;God Save the Queen&#x27;: &quot;It was like &#x27;Love Me Do&#x27; or something&quot;.

Although many believe it was created because of the Silver Jubilee, the band has denied it, with Paul Cook saying that &quot;it wasn&#x27;t written specifically for the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee. We weren&#x27;t aware of it at the time. It wasn&#x27;t a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone.&quot; Johnny Rotten has explained the lyrics as follows: &quot;You don&#x27;t write &#x27;God Save the Queen&#x27; because you hate the English race. You write a song like that because you love them, and you&#x27;re fed up with them being mistreated.&quot; He intended to evoke sympathy for the English working class and a general resentment towards the monarchy.

On 7 June 1977, the Jubilee holiday, the band attempted to play the song from a boat named the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; on the River Thames, near the Palace of Westminster. After a scuffle involving attendee Jah Wobble and a camera man, 11 people, including Malcolm McLaren, the man who organized the concert, and several other members of the band&#x27;s entourage, were arrested when the boat docked.

==Release and reception==
The single was released on 27 May 1977, and was regarded by many of the general public as an assault on Queen Elizabeth and the monarchy. During the media furore over the single, Lydon and producers Bill Price and Chris Thomas were subject to a razor attack outside a pub in Highbury, London.

Agreeing with the apparent anti-Windsor message, American postmodern author William S. Burroughs sent a congratulatory letter to the Sex Pistols following the release of the song.

Before the group signed to Virgin, a small number of copies of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; had been pressed on the A&amp;M label. These are now among the most valuable records ever pressed in the UK, with a resale value as of 2006 of between £500 and £13,000 a copy, depending on condition of the disc. The B-side of the A&amp;M single was &quot;No Feeling&quot;, an early rough mix or performance of &quot;No Feelings&quot;. (A later version was released on the Pistols&#x27; debut album.) &quot;Record Collector&quot; named the A&amp;M single the most collectable record of all time. On July 5th 2024 a new record sale price of £24,320 (over $31,000) was set at specialist vinyl auction house Wessex Auction Rooms in the UK by auctioneer Martin Hughes.

===Censorship and chart controversy===
Upon its release, the song was banned from both the BBC and radio stations regulated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority with Radio 2 controller Charles McLelland saying the song was &quot;in gross bad taste&quot;. Additionally, the major retailers Boots, WHSmith, and Woolworths all declined to sell the record. Nevertheless, it peaked at No. 2 (below Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Talk About It&quot; released as a double A-side budget single along with &quot;The First Cut Is the Deepest&quot;) on the official UK Singles Chart used by the BBC; it did so during the week of the Silver Jubilee&#x27;s official observation. On the singles chart displayed in branches of WH Smith, the single&#x27;s position at No. 2 was represented by a blank line.

However, various sources state that it was indeed the highest-selling single of the week, and it has been suggested that the song was deliberately blocked from reaching the top spot on the &quot;official&quot; BMRB chart. According to a 1998 article in &quot;The Independent&quot;, for one week compilers &quot;decreed that shops which sold their own records could not have those records represented in the chart&quot;, and thus sales from Virgin Megastores were not counted. Virgin had few doubts that theirs was the higher-selling single; the company&#x27;s sales total out of stock exceeded the officially cited sales for the Rod Stewart single. The &quot;NME&quot; magazine chart did in fact place the single at number-one during the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. In 2001, the BBC described the song as having &quot;reached number one in the UK&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was included on &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;, the band&#x27;s only album, and several subsequent compilation albums.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; number 175 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and it is also one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. It was &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s Single of the Year in 1977. In 1989, it was eighteenth in the list of &quot;NME&quot; writers&#x27; all-time top 150 singles. &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 2002 ranked it first on its list of &quot;The 50 Most Exciting Tunes Ever...&quot; and third on its list of &quot;100 Songs That Changed the World&quot; in 2003. In 2007, &quot;NME&quot; launched a campaign to get the song to number 1 in the British charts and encouraged readers to purchase or download the single on 8 October. However, it only made number 42. In 2010, the &quot;New Statesman&quot; listed it as one of the &quot;Top 20 Political Songs&quot;.

In 2010, the song was ranked among the top 10 most controversial songs of all time in a poll conducted by PRS for Music.

In 2002, the song was re-released to coincide with the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, whereupon the single charted in the top 20. In 2012, it was announced that the single would be re-released on 28 May 2012, coinciding with the 35th anniversary of the original release and the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. Lydon has voiced his disapproval over the re-release and the campaign, saying in a statement: &quot;I would like to very strongly distance myself from the recent stories and campaign to push &#x27;God Save the Queen&#x27; for the number one spot... this campaign totally undermines what The Sex Pistols stood for.&quot; The 2012 re-release peaked at no. 80 in the singles chart. Rights holder UMC re-released the record for the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee in 2022, with 1,977 vinyl copies having the same tracks as the original A&amp;M version and the rest labelled as a Virgin release. The record sold 5,712 vinyl copies and became the number one single on the Official Physical Singles Chart Top 100 of 10 June 2022 to 16 June 2022, with a chart placing of number 57 in the main chart when the 279 downloads were added.

In recent years, Lydon has moderated his views on the royal family. In 2001, he stated: &quot;Is the Queen a moron? I probably think so. That woman has precious little to do with her so-called subjects, other than ignore the hell out of us... We&#x27;re just there to prop up her tiara.&quot; The following year, he denied he was an anti-monarchy in an interview on &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;: &quot;I was never pro them or anti them. I just think if we&#x27;re going to have a monarchy it may as well work properly. I mean, we pay for it, after all&quot;. Despite his previous 2001 comments about the Queen, Lydon stated on Piers Morgan Live in 2015: &quot;I never said I didn&#x27;t [love the Queen], I just don&#x27;t like the institution&quot;. In another interview with Piers Morgan on &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot; in 2022, the year of Platinum Jubilee, Lydon further expressed his respect for the Queen: &quot;I&#x27;m [not] completely dead against The Royal Family as human beings. I&#x27;m actually really really proud of the Queen for surviving and doing so well. I applaud her for that. That is a fantastic achievement. I&#x27;m not a curmudgeon about that. I just think that if I&#x27;m paying my tax money to support this system, I should have a say so on how it&#x27;s spent&quot;. Lydon stated in a June 2022 opinion piece published during the Queen&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee that he had softened his views on royalty and did not harbor any resentment against the royal family. He signed it off with &quot;God save the Queen&quot;. Guitarist Steve Jones and bassist Glen Matlock also expressed their views on the monarchy in 2022. Jones stated: &quot;I’ve never had any connection to the monarchy, to be honest. It meant nothing to me, still doesn&#x27;t. So to me [&#x27;God Save the Queen&#x27;] was just a laugh, it was a giggle&quot;. While Matlock stated in an interview with &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve nothing personal against the queen, lots of people love and respect her, but I do think she&#x27;s a bit of a sop to what&#x27;s going on&quot;.

With the death of Elizabeth II in September 2022 and the accession of King Charles III, Matlock began to perform a modified version of the song which reflects the royal succession. Lydon paid tribute to the Queen on Twitter and subsequently objected to any commercial use of The Sex Pistols&#x27; tracks to capitalize on the Queen&#x27;s death.

===Use in other media===
The song could be heard during &quot;Journey Along the Thames&quot;, a two-minute film directed by Danny Boyle and played at the beginning of the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, an event opened by the queen Elizabeth II, and held during her Diamond Jubilee. A camera traverses the route the band took in the boat the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, between Tower Bridge and Westminster, as the song plays.

On 3 November 2016, Andrew Rosindell, a Conservative MP, argued in an early day motion for a return to the broadcasting of the national anthem at the end of BBC One transmissions each day (the practice had been dropped in 1997, due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting BBC News 24 overnight, rendering closedown obsolete), to commemorate the Brexit vote and Britain&#x27;s subsequent withdrawing from the European Union. At the evening of the same day, BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme ended its nightly broadcast with host of that night Kirsty Wark saying that they were &quot;incredibly happy to oblige&quot; Rosindell&#x27;s request, and then played a clip of the Sex Pistols&#x27; similarly named song, much to Rosindell&#x27;s discontent.

The single&#x27;s picture sleeve, featuring a defaced image of Queen Elizabeth II, was designed by Jamie Reid and in 2001 was ranked No. 1 in a list of the 100 greatest record covers of all time by &quot;Q&quot; magazine. A photograph of the image is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London.

==Cover versions==
===Motörhead version===
A cover version by the English heavy metal band Motörhead was released as a single in 2000 to promote their album, &quot;We Are Motörhead&quot;. It also appears on their covers album &quot;Under Cöver&quot; (2017).

The cover art gives further reference to the Sex Pistols by using the same cut-out words to form the title as the Sex Pistols&#x27; single cover.

A performance of the song recorded during the band&#x27;s twenty-fifth anniversary concert at Brixton Academy, on 22 October 2000, appears on their 25 &amp; Alive Boneshaker DVD.

On the 18 March 1983 episode of &quot;SCTV&quot; in the &quot;Mel&#x27;s Rock Pile&quot; segment, Mel Slirrup (Eugene Levy) has a tribute to punk rock featuring a number by the band the Queenhaters—Martin Short (lead singer), Andrea Martin (lead guitarist/back-up vocals), Eugene Levy (rhythm guitarist), Joe Flaherty (bass), and John Candy (drummer)—performing &quot;I Hate the Bloody Queen&quot;, a sound-alike song that almost matches the original it is spoofing, with references to the Falklands War (&quot;I&#x27;d like to drown the Queen/Off the coast of Argentine/Throw her off a battleship/With her Falkland war machine!&quot;) and the problems that Princess Diana was, and would be soon having with her in-laws (&quot;I feel sorry for you, Lady Di/Having a mother-in-law like that!&quot;). This spoof of the Sex Pistols &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; even has its own cover version by Mudhoney on the tribute album &quot;Oh Canaduh! 2&quot;.

<doc id="375645" wikidata="Q44648" url="?curid=375645" title="Eric Burdon">
<text>Eric Victor Burdon (born 11 May 1941) is an English singer and songwriter. He was previously the lead vocalist of the R&amp;B and rock band the Animals and the funk band War. He is regarded as one of the British Invasion&#x27;s most distinctive singers with his deep, powerful blues-rock voice. Burdon is also known for his intense stage performances.

In 2008, he was ranked 57th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;.

== Early life ==

Eric Burdon was born in 1941 in Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, England. His father, Matt, was originally from Tyneside. His mother, Rene, was originally from Ireland and had moved to Scotland before settling in Newcastle in the 1930s. He had a younger sister, Irene. Burdon&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Victor&quot;, resulted from a reward of £25 offered by the Lord Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne to mothers who gave their newly born children suitably patriotic names.

Burdon was born to a working class family. Burdon describes his early school years as a &quot;dark nightmare&quot; that &quot;should&#x27;ve been penned by Charles Dickens&quot;. Due to the river pollution and humidity in Newcastle he suffered asthma attacks daily. During primary school, he was &quot;stuck at the rear of the classroom of around 40 to 50 kids and received constant harassment from kids and teachers alike.&quot; He goes on to say his primary school was &quot;jammed between a slaughterhouse and a shipyard on the banks of the Tyne. Some teachers were sadistic – others pretended not to notice – and sexual molestation and regular corporal punishment with a leather strap was the order of the day.&quot;

At secondary school, a teacher by the name of Bertie Brown was responsible for getting him into Newcastle College of Art and Industrial Design (now part of Northumbria University) and changing his life forever. It was while studying graphics and photography at the College that he first met John Steel, the original drummer for the Animals. He also met a lot of other &quot;young rebels&quot; who shared his interest in jazz, folk, and movies.

Burdon started out his young adult life as one of a group of people who hung out at the local jazz club, The Downbeat. He describes his friends as &quot;like a motorcycle gang ... without the motorcycles&quot; – they were tough, hard-drinking, and listened to American music. Burdon and fellow rocker and guitarist, American Jimi Hendrix, became very close friends in the mid-sixties and remained so up until Hendrix&#x27;s death in 1970. Burdon was the person Hendrix&#x27;s girlfriend called when she found him overdosed on drugs. 

Burdon was also a good friend of John Lennon and, claims Burdon, was mentioned in one of their songs, &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; as &quot;the eggman&quot;. Burdon states, &quot;The nickname stuck after a wild experience I&#x27;d had at the time with a Jamaican girlfriend called Sylvia. I was up early one morning cooking breakfast, naked except for my socks, and she slid up beside me and slipped an amyl nitrite capsule under my nose. As the fumes set my brain alight and I slid to the kitchen floor, she reached to the counter and grabbed an egg, which she cracked into the pit of my belly. The white and yellow of the egg ran down my naked front and Sylvia began to show me one Jamaican trick after another. I shared the story with John at a party at a Mayfair flat one night with a handful of others.&quot; According to Burdon, Lennon, finding the story hilarious, replied, &quot;Go on, go get it, Eggman&quot;, incorporating the incident into his song in tribute to the unique experience.

== Career ==
===The Animals===

Burdon was lead vocalist of the Animals, formed during 1962 in Newcastle upon Tyne. The original band was the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo, which formed in 1958; they became the Animals shortly after Burdon joined the band. The Animals combined electric blues with rock; in the US they were considered one of the leading bands of the British Invasion. Along with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Hollies, the Dave Clark Five, and the Kinks, the group introduced contemporary British music and fashion to American audiences. Burdon&#x27;s powerful voice can be heard on the Animals&#x27; singles &quot;The House of the Rising Sun&quot;, &quot;Baby Let Me Take You Home&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Crying&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;, &quot;Bring It On Home to Me&quot;, &quot;We Gotta Get Out of This Place&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down&quot;, &quot;See See Rider&quot;, &quot;Help Me Girl&quot;, &quot;Monterey&quot;, and &quot;Sky Pilot&quot;.

The Animals&#x27; keyboardist Alan Price left the band in May 1965, and drummer John Steel followed in April 1966. Burdon has often attributed the disintegration of the band to conflict with Price, specifically that Price had claimed sole rights and ownership to &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;. Burdon and drummer Barry Jenkins reformed the group as Eric Burdon and the Animals. Their first studio album was &quot;Eric Is Here&quot;, which featured the hit single &quot;Help Me Girl&quot;, released in December 1966, in which Burdon and drummer Jenkins teamed up with Animals&#x27; keyboardist Dave Rowberry, Animals&#x27; original bassist Chas Chandler, and Animals&#x27; original guitarist Hilton Valentine, and session musicians arranged and conducted by Horace Ott.

According to Peter Dunbavan, &quot;Help Me Girl&quot; included Hammond organ and brass with great effect and is too often overlooked today. Then followed a more psychedelic incarnation of the group that featured future Family member John Weider and was sometimes called Eric Burdon and the New Animals. Keyboardist Zoot Money joined during 1968 until the band broke up in 1969. This group&#x27;s hits included the ballad &quot;San Franciscan Nights&quot;, the grunge–heavy metal-pioneering &quot;When I Was Young&quot;, &quot;Monterey&quot;, the anti-Vietnam anthem &quot;Sky Pilot&quot;, &quot;White Houses&quot; and the progressive cover of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;.

In 1975, the original Animals reunited and recorded a studio album called &quot;Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted&quot;, released in 1977. In May 1983, the Animals reunited with their original line-up and released the studio album &quot;Ark&quot; on 16 June 1983, along with the singles &quot;The Night&quot; and &quot;Love Is for All Time&quot;. A world tour followed, and the concert at Wembley Arena, London, recorded on 31 December 1983, was released in 1984 as &quot;Greatest Hits Live (Rip It to Shreds)&quot;. Their concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in April 1984 was released in 2008 as &quot;Last Live Show&quot;; the band members were augmented by Zoot Money, Nippy Noya, Steve Gregory and Steve Grant. The original Animals broke up for the last time at the end of 1984.
Although the band Burdon formed in the late 1960s was sometimes called Eric Burdon and the New Animals, it was not until 1998 that the name Eric Burdon and the New Animals was officially adopted. The 1998 band had bassist Dave Meros, guitarist Dean Restum, drummer Aynsley Dunbar and keyboard guitarist Neal Morse. They recorded &quot;Live at the Coach House&quot; on 17 October 1998, released on video and DVD in December that year. In 1999 they released &quot;The Official Live Bootleg No. 2&quot; and in August 2000 &quot;The Official Live Bootleg 2000&quot;, with Martin Gerschwitz on keyboards.

In June 2003, he formed another Eric Burdon and the Animals, with keyboardist Martin Gerschwitz, bassist Dave Meros, guitarist Dean Restum, and drummer Bernie Pershey. They broke up in 2005. During 2008 Burdon toured again as Eric Burdon and the Animals with a variable line-up of backing musicians.

On 13 December 2008 Burdon lost a three-year legal battle to use the name &quot;the Animals&quot; in the UK, with drummer John Steel owning the rights, in the UK only, as a result. Steel was a member in the band&#x27;s heyday and left in 1966, before the band broke up three years later; he later played in various reunion versions of the band with Burdon. Burdon still toured as Eric Burdon and the Animals, but was prevented from using the name &quot;the Animals&quot; in Britain while the case was under appeal. On 9 September 2013 Burdon&#x27;s appeal was allowed, with him then entitled to use the band name in the UK.

In 2016, Burdon formed the current line-up of the Animals, including Johnzo West (guitar and vocals), Davey Allen (keyboards and vocals), Dustin Koester (drums and vocals), Justin Andres (bass guitar and vocals), Ruben Salinas (saxophone and flute), and Evan Mackey (trombone).

===War===
In 1969, while living in San Francisco, Burdon joined forces with California funk rock band War. In April 1970, the resulting studio album was titled &quot;Eric Burdon Declares &quot;War&quot;&quot; which produced the singles &quot;Spill the Wine&quot; and &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;. A two-disc set entitled &quot;The Black-Man&#x27;s Burdon&quot; was released in September 1970. The singles from their double album, &quot;Paint It Black&quot; and &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take Away Our Music&quot;, had moderate success during 1971. During this time Burdon collapsed on the stage during a concert, caused by an asthma attack, and War continued the tour without him.

In 1976, a compilation album, &quot;Love Is All Around&quot;, released by ABC Records, included recordings of Eric Burdon with War doing a live version of &quot;Paint It Black&quot; and a cover of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. 

Eric Burdon and War were reunited for the first time in 37 years, to perform an Eric Burdon &amp; War reunion at the concert at the Royal Albert Hall London on 21 April 2008. The concert coincided with a major reissue campaign by Rhino Records (UK), which released all the War albums including &quot;Eric Burdon Declares &quot;War&quot;&quot; and &quot;The Black-Man&#x27;s Burdon&quot;.

The version of the band that performed alongside Burdon in 2008 at the Royal Albert Hall was not the original band but a reformed one led by the only original member, keyboardist Lonnie Jordan. This was due to a court injunction. The remaining surviving members of WAR perform as &quot;The LowRider Band&quot;.

===Solo career===
Burdon began a solo career in 1971 with the Eric Burdon Band, continuing with a hard rock–heavy metal–funk style. In August 1971, he recorded the studio album &quot;Guilty!&quot;, which featured the blues shouter Jimmy Witherspoon and Ike White of the San Quentin Prison Band. In 1973, the band performed at the Reading Festival. At the end of 1974, the band released the album &quot;Sun Secrets&quot; followed by the album &quot;Stop&quot; in 1975. Burdon moved to Germany in 1977 and recorded the album &quot;Survivor&quot; with a line-up including guitarist Alexis Korner and keyboardist Zoot Money; the album also had a line-up of four guitarists and three keyboardists and is known for its interesting album cover, which depicts Burdon screaming. The album was produced by former Animals bassist Chas Chandler. The original release included a booklet of illustrated lyrics done in ink by Burdon himself.

In May 1978, he recorded the studio album &quot;Darkness Darkness&quot; at the Roundwood House in County Laois, Ireland, using Ronnie Lane&#x27;s Mobile Studio and featuring guitarist and vocalist Bobby Tench from the Jeff Beck Group, who had left Streetwalkers a few months before. The album was eventually released in 1980. During January 1979, Burdon changed his band for a tour taking in Hamburg, Germany and the Netherlands.

On 28 August 1982, the &quot;Eric Burdon Band&quot; including Red Young (keyboards) performed at the Rockpalast Open Air Concert at the Lorelei, Germany. Following this Burdon toured heavily with his solo project from March 1984 to March 1985, taking in UK, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Canada and Australia. In 1986, Burdon published his autobiography titled &quot;I Used to Be an Animal, but I&#x27;m Alright Now&quot;.

In March 1979, he played a concert in Cologne and changed the band&#x27;s name to Eric Burdon&#x27;s Fire Department, whose line-up included backing vocalist Jackie Carter of Silver Convention, Bertram Engel of Udo Lindenberg&#x27;s &quot;Panik Orchester&quot; and Jean-Jaques Kravetz. In mid 1980, they recorded the album &quot;The Last Drive&quot;. &quot;Eric Burdon&#x27;s Fire Department&quot; toured Europe with this line-up and Paul Millns and Louisiana Red made special appearances in Spain and Italy. By December 1980, the band had broken up.

In April 1981, Christel Buschmann began to film &quot;Comeback&quot; with Burdon as the star. They created a new Eric Burdon Band whose line-up included Louisiana Red, Tony Braunagle, John Sterling and Snuffy Walden. This band recorded live tracks in Los Angeles. They also recorded in Berlin with another line-up, the only remaining member being John Sterling. In September 1981, the final scenes of &quot;Comeback&quot; were shot in the Berlin Metropole and Burdon and his band continued to tour through Australia and North America. A studio album titled &quot;Comeback&quot; was released in 1982. The 1983 album &quot;Power Company&quot; also included songs recorded during the &quot;Comeback&quot; project.

In 1988, he put together a band with 15 musicians including Andrew Giddings – keyboards, Steve Stroud – bass, Adrian Sheppard – drums, Jamie Moses – guitar and four backing vocalists to record the studio album &quot;I Used to Be an Animal&quot; in Malibu, in the United States. In 1990, Eric Burdon&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; was used for the film &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot;. The song, which played at the beginning of the film, was also released as a single. He also recorded the singles &quot;We Gotta Get out of this Place&quot; with Katrina and the Waves and &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; with Tony Carey and Anne Haigis. Later in 1990, he had a small line-up of an &quot;Eric Burdon Band&quot; featuring Jimmy Zavala (saxophone and harmonica), Dave Meros (bass guitar), Jeff Naideau (keyboards), Thom Mooney (drums) and John Sterling (guitar) before he began a tour with the Doors guitarist Robby Krieger and they appeared at a concert from Ventura Beach, California, which was released as a DVD on 20 June 2008.

On 13 April 2004, he released a &quot;comeback&quot; album, &quot;My Secret Life&quot;, which was his first album with new recordings for 16 years. When John Lee Hooker died in 2001, Burdon had written the song &quot;Can&#x27;t Kill the Boogieman&quot; the co-writers of the songs, on the album, were Tony Braunagel and Marcelo Nova. In 2005, they released a live album, &quot;Athens Traffic Live&quot;, with special DVD bonus material and a bonus studio track and disbanded in November 2005. He began a short touring as the &quot;Blues Knights&quot;.

On 27 January 2006, he released his blues–R&amp;B album &quot;Soul of a Man&quot;. This album was dedicated to Ray Charles and John Lee Hooker. The cover of the album was a picture which was sent to Burdon a few years before. Burdon then formed a new band, with the following members: Red Young (keyboards), Paula O&#x27;Rourke (bass), Eric McFadden (guitar), Carl Carlton (guitar) and Wally Ingram (drums). They also performed at the Lugano Festival and in 2007 he toured as the headlining act of the &quot;Hippiefest&quot; line-up, produced and hosted by Country Joe McDonald.

Burdon, at 71, recorded an EP with Cincinnati garage band the Greenhornes called, simply, &quot;Eric Burdon &amp; the Greenhornes&quot;. The album was recorded at an all-analogue recording studio, and released on 23 November 2012 as part of Record Store Day&#x27;s &quot;Black Friday&quot;.

In 2013, Eric Burdon came out with a new album called, &quot;Til Your River Runs Dry&quot;. The lead single off the album was called &quot;Water&quot; and was inspired by a conversation he had with former Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.

===Other associations===

In 1991, Burdon and Brian Auger formed the &quot;Eric Burdon – Brian Auger Band&quot; with the following line-up: Eric Burdon – vocals, Brian Auger – keyboards, vocals, Dave Meros – bass guitar, vocals, Don Kirkpatrick – guitar, vocals and Paul Crowder – drums, vocals. By 1992, Larry Wilkins replaced Kirkpatrick and Karma Auger (Brian&#x27;s son) replaced Crowder and in 1993 they added Richard Reguria (percussion). The live album &quot;Access All Areas&quot; was then released. In 1994 the &quot;Eric Burdon – Brian Auger Band&quot; disbanded. Burdon then formed the &quot;Eric Burdon&#x27;s i Band&quot;.

In October 1996, Aynsley Dunbar replaced Craney on drums. &quot;The Official Live Bootleg&quot; was recorded in 1997 and in May that year Larry Wilkins died of cancer. He also released the compilation albums &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot; which featured recordings from the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1996, the lead singer of Brazilian rock band Camisa de Vênus, the vocalist Marcelo Nova worked in partnership with the former lead singer of the Animals. Burdon and Nova composed the song &quot;Black &amp; White World&quot; and sang in a duet on &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot; on the Camisa de Venus album &quot;Quem É Você?&quot;, produced by Burdon.

In 2000, he recorded the song &quot;Power to the People&quot; together with Ringo Starr and Billy Preston for the motion picture &quot;Steal This Movie!&quot;. On 11 May 2001, the Animals were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame on Burdon&#x27;s 60th birthday. On 3 March 2002, the live album &quot;Live in Seattle&quot; was recorded. Ex-War member Lee Oskar made a guest appearance on the album. In 2003 he made a guest appearance on the album &quot;Joyous in the City of Fools&quot; by the Greek rock band Pyx Lax, singing lead vocals on &quot;Someone Wrote &#x27;Save me&#x27; On a Wall&quot;.
In 2001, his second critically acclaimed memoir, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;, written with author and filmmaker J. Marshall Craig, was released in the US, followed by editions in Greece, Germany and Australia; it covers the British Invasion, moving to Los Angeles and Palm Springs, and various anecdotes about Rock and Roll stardom.

In 2004, in his studio album My Secret Life, besides presenting the song composed in partnership with the Brazilian rocker Marcelo Nova &quot;Black &amp; White World&quot;, Eric Burdon shed to the English and re-recorded two songs of Marcelo Nova: &quot;A Garota da Motocicleta&quot; turned &quot;Motorcycle Girl&quot; while &quot;Coração Satânico&quot; became &quot;Devil&#x27;s Slide&quot;.

On 7 June 2008, Burdon performed at the memorial service of Bo Diddley in Gainesville, Florida. During July and August 2008, Burdon appeared as the headline act of the &quot;Hippiefest&quot;. He also recorded the single &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; with Carl Carlton and Max Buskohl.

On 29 September 2021, Burdon performed on the Greek TV show &quot;Mousiko kouti&quot; hosted by Nikos Portokaloglou and Rena Morfi.

==Ownership of Animals name==
In 2008, an adjudicator determined that John Steel owned &quot;The Animals&quot; name in Britain by virtue of a trademark registration Steel had made in relation to the name. Eric Burdon had objected to the trademark registration, arguing that Burdon personally embodied any goodwill associated with the Animals name. Burdon&#x27;s argument was rejected, in part based on the fact that he had billed himself as Eric Burdon and the Animals as early as 1967, thus separating the goodwill associated with his own name from that of the band.

In 2013 Burdon won an appeal, making him a joint owner of the Animals name.

==Film career==
Burdon wanted to act in the film &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966). Director Michelangelo Antonioni wanted to use him as a musician in a club scene, but Burdon turned the role down because he had acted in films before in which he sang songs. He disbanded the Animals and went to California, where he met Jim Morrison of the Doors and decided he wanted to go into acting. Later, he turned down major roles in &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; and &quot;Performance&quot; (both 1970).

In 1973, he formed the Eric Burdon Band and recorded the soundtrack for his own film project, &quot;Mirage&quot;. He spent much money to make this film, produced as a film for Atlantic. The film and the soundtrack were to be released in July 1974, but somehow they never were. The soundtrack was released in 2008.

In 1979, he acted in the TV film &quot;The 11th Victim&quot;, then in the German film &quot;Gibbi Westgermany&quot; (1980). In 1982, he starred in another German film, &quot;Comeback&quot;, again as a singer. In 1991, he made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Doors&quot;.

In 1998, he played himself in the Greek film &quot;My Brother and I&quot;, followed by a bigger role in the German film &quot;Snow on New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; (1999).

In the following years, he was credited in many documentaries and in an independent film called &quot;Fabulous Shiksa in Distress&quot; (2003), along with Ned Romero and Ted Markland.
In 2007, he performed the traditional &quot;Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child&quot; in the drama festival film &quot;The Blue Hour&quot; and in a documentary about Joshua Tree, called &quot;Nowhere Now&quot; (2008).

==Personal life==
In 1967 Burdon married Angela &quot;Angie&quot; King, an Anglo-Indian hippie and model connected to the music scene. The next year she left him for Jimi Hendrix and they divorced in 1969. She was killed in 1992 by an estranged boyfriend.

In 1972 Burdon married Rose Marks, with whom he has a daughter. They divorced in 1978.

In 1999, he married Marianna Proestou, a Greek lawyer.

<text>The Black Country Living Museum (formerly the Black Country Museum) is an open-air museum of rebuilt historic buildings in Dudley, West Midlands, England. It is located in the centre of the Black Country, 10 miles west of Birmingham. The museum occupies of former industrial land partly reclaimed from a former railway goods yard, disused lime kilns, canal arm and former coal pits.

The museum opened to the public in 1978, and has since added over 50 shops, houses and other industrial buildings from around the metropolitan boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall and the City of Wolverhampton (collectively known as the Black Country); mainly in a specially built village. Most buildings were relocated from their original sites to form a base from where demonstrators portray life spanning 300 years of history, with a focus on 1850–1950.

The museum continues to evolve, as further buildings and other exhibits are added.

==Background==
The museum is close to the site where Dud Dudley first experimented with the technique of smelting iron with coal instead of wood charcoal and making iron in modest quantities for industrial use. Abraham Darby later refined the process using coke to produce a better quality product in greater quantities. Dudley has a claim to be &quot;the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution&quot;, the Black Country is famous for its wide range of midsteel-based products from nails to the anchor and anchor chain for .

The site&#x27;s coal mining heritage is shown by an underground drift and colliery surface buildings. The museum has a working replica of a Newcomen atmospheric engine. Thomas Newcomen&#x27;s invention was first successfully put to use in Tipton in 1712. The museum&#x27;s reconstruction was based on a print engraved by Thomas Barney, filemaker of Wolverhampton, in 1719.

Electric trams and trolleybuses transport visitors from the entrance to the village where thirty domestic and industrial buildings have been relocated close to the canal basin. The museum is one of three in the UK with working trolleybuses. The route to the village passes the Cast Iron Houses and a 1930s fairground. A narrowboat operated by Dudley Canal Trust makes trips on the Dudley Canal and into the Dudley Tunnel.

On 16 February 2012, the museum&#x27;s collection was awarded designated status by Arts Council England, a mark of distinction celebrating its unique national and international importance.

The museum is run by the Black Country Living Museum Trust, a registered charity under English law.

==Exhibitions==

By the main entrance in the old Rolfe Street Baths from Smethwick (1888) are displays of local artefacts encompassing some of the many products which were made by Black Country industry, cast iron hollow ware, animal traps, vehicles, chain, anchors, enamels, weighing scales, laundry irons, nails, locks and fire clay products. The exhibition includes more fragile items such as glassware, reflecting the centuries-old industry that produced lead crystal glass and the Joseph Chance glass works between Oldbury and Smethwick.

==Mining and lime kilns==
The museum site contained 42 disused mine shafts, most of which had been filled in. Two are preserved, one at the Racecourse Colliery and Brook Shaft.

In 1712, Thomas Newcomen built the world&#x27;s first successful steam engine which was used for pumping water from coal mines on Lord Dudley&#x27;s estates. In 1986, after ten years of research, the museum completed the construction of a full-scale working replica of the engine. The &quot;fire engine&quot; is housed in a brick building from which a wooden beam projects through one wall. Rods hang from the outer end of the beam and operate pumps at the bottom of the mine shaft which raise the water to the surface. The engine has a boiler, a cylinder and piston and operating valves. A coal fire heats water in the boiler which is little more than a covered pan and the steam generated passes through a valve into the brass cylinder above it. The cylinder is more than two metres long and 52 centimetres in diameter. The steam in the cylinder is condensed by injecting cold water and the vacuum beneath the piston pulls the inner end of the beam down causing the pump to move.

Lime working and processing was carried out on the site from medieval times. Evidence of quarries and underground remains, the canal, and preserved lime kilns are parts of a scheduled ancient monument which has features from the medieval, Industrial Revolution and 20th century.
Standing alongside canal arm are the lime kilns, built by the Earl of Dudley to process limestone quarried from Wren&#x27;s Nest workings. The earliest of the three surviving kilns dates from the late 18th century.

==Metal working==
The trap shop was built in 1913 in Rookery Street, Wednesfield. It was offered to the museum in 1982. Sidebotham&#x27;s Steel Trap Works was not rebuilt in its entirety and the original structure was shortened. The exhibit, set around 1930, contains the office, trap shop and the machine shop.

The nail shop is a replica of a back-yard workshop, built in the 1880s from 17 Chapel Street, Halesowen. It houses equipment from the Halesowen workshop operated by Sidney Tether in the 1940s. It is in use on a regular basis by the resident nail maker who demonstrates the skill of forging nails by hand.

The brass foundry was built in 1869 in Shaw Street, Walsall and closed after the Second World War but re-opened in 1964 by James Powell and used until his death in 1973. The building and its equipment were relocated to the museum in 1986. It can be seen in operation when the brass caster demonstrates traditional skills in casting horse brasses, pot hooks and other small items.

The rolling mill installed at the Birchley Works in Oldbury in 1923 ceased to operate in 1976 and it was moved to Lord Ward&#x27;s Canal Arm. The museum operates it from time to time using volunteers.

The Anchor Forge was rescued from Isiah Preston&#x27;s in Cradley Heath. The steam-hammer was installed second hand in the 1920s to forge parts for ships&#x27; anchors and the other equipment including furnace and boiler also came from Prestons. The building was saved from Johnson&#x27;s Rolling Mill site in West Bromwich.

The chain maker&#x27;s shop represents one of the many workshops that made small and medium size chain. By the mid-1800s the chain industry was mostly associated with Cradley, Cradley Heath, Old Hill, Quarry Bank and Netherton. It is operational and the skill of making chain by hand can be watched daily.

An Oliver hammer was a treadle-operated hammer that forged bolts by forcing red hot lengths of iron into a die. The machine shop contained several Oliver hammers used to forge special parts to order. It was founded by Onan Lowe and taken over by T. W. Lench Ltd.

==Village==
On the low ground at the northern end of the site, houses, shops, workshops and public buildings have been dismantled and rebuilt brick by brick to create an early 20th-century village. Activities in the buildings are demonstrated by staff in period costume. The village preserves a cross section of social and industrial history.

The village shops include Gregory&#x27;s General Store, Emile Doo&#x27;s chemist shop, a sweet shop and cake shop with a bakery at the back. There is a hardware and ironmongers shop from Pipers Row in Wolverhampton. and a pawnbroker&#x27;s shop that was relocated to the museum in 1991.

Brook Street back-to-back houses, built in the 1850s, were relocated from Woodsetton and were the homes of colliers, farm workers and ironworkers. The anchor maker&#x27;s house from Lawrence Lane in Old Hill was the first to be relocated to the museum and is an example of late-Victorian housing.

Public buildings include Providence Chapel from Darby End/Hand near Netherton, one of the first buildings to be rebuilt, and the Bottle and Glass Inn, a working public house set out as it would have been in 1910.

The village postbox stood on the corner of Baker Street and Blandford Street, London in 1865. It was designed by architect J W Penfold and made by Cochrane, Grove and Company.

The Carter&#x27;s Yard from Ogley Hay Road Burntwood, Cannock was built around 1900. It was dismantled and brought to the museum in the 1990s.

==1930s Street (Old Birmingham Road)==
Old Birmingham Road links St James&#x27;s School with the Cradley Heath Workers&#x27; Institute. Here buildings have been set in the 1930s to tell the story of the years leading up to the Second World War.

Museum staff in St James&#x27;s School demonstrate lessons and school life from the turn of the 20th century. The school building opened in Eve Hill, Dudley in 1842 for pupils aged 5–11. It was decided to transfer the building to the museum in 1989 and relocation was completed by October 1990, with the exhibit opening the following year.

Hobbs &amp; Sons fish and chip shop and H Morrall&#x27;s gentlemen&#x27;s outfitters have been returned to 1935 condition. The shops come from Hall Street, Dudley and date from the late-18th century and refaced with bright red pressed brickwork in 1889. The tiled interior of Hobbs features restored hand-painted tiled wall panels. The frying range is of a design patented in 1932 made by E.W. Proctor of Huddersfield. In the 1930s many of Joseph Hobbs&#x27;s customers worked in factories or shops.

Four buildings were rescued from Birmingham Street, Oldbury and date to about 1860. The block is dominated by the green painted fascia of Humphrey Brothers, builders&#x27; merchants, who occupied the premises from 1921. It has a replica shop front from about 1932. Humphreys sold fireplaces, sanitaryware and building supplies including Walpamur, a flat paint used for internal walls. The motorcycle shop is based on the business of A. Hartill &amp; Sons which was located in Mount Pleasant, Bilston. The window displays six locally made motor bikes dating from 1929 to 1934. Next door is Alfred Preedy &amp; Sons tobacconist shop, established in Dudley in 1868. James Gripton&#x27;s radio shop is from the 1920s and this reconstruction, set in 1939, contains &#x27;new&#x27; and second radios.

The brick tunnel and cart entrance provide access to a late 1930s kitchen with an electric cooker made by Revo of Tipton. There is a radio workshop behind Gripton&#x27;s and then the stairs lead to two first floor living rooms and two bedrooms which are all set in the late 1930s and furnished with original 1930s style furniture and wall paper.

The Cradley Heath Workers&#x27; Institute was built with surplus funds raised in 1910 during the strike for a minimum wage by women chain makers. The Arts and Crafts style building was designed by architect, Albert Thomas Butler, and opened on 10 June 1912. It became a centre for educational meetings, social gatherings and trade union activities in Cradley Heath. Re-erected at the museum it is a monument to Mary Macarthur and her campaign to establish a national minimum wage in the &quot;sweated trades&quot; where people worked long hours for poverty wages typically in appalling conditions. The building contains reconstructed offices, a news room with a digital interpretation of the background to the strike and a large hall which is used for a wide range of activities including theatre performances and concerts.

==1930s fairground==
The 1930s fairground located behind the school represents a travelling fairground that would have brought entertainment to people in the early 1900s. Such fairs set up on waste ground and for a few days provided thrills, entertainment and a change for those who might never go on holiday. The collection of historic rides includes a helter skelter and the Ark, the latest thing in high-speed rides when introduced in the 1920s. It was updated over the years but not converted into a waltzer. It remains one of the few &quot;fourlift&quot; Arks in the country.

== Lord Ward&#x27;s Canal Arm ==
Work began on the boat dock in 1976 and the museum aimed to recreate a typical dock that would have been found on the Birmingham Canal Navigations (BCN). Docks like the one at the museum would have been formed from recycled wooden boats. They were used to build wooden boats or maintain iron and composite boats.
Adjacent to the museum is the Dudley Tunnel. Visitors can take a 45-minute skipper-guided trip into the tunnel through the historic limestone mines and caverns on a boat operated by the Dudley Canal Trust.

=== Boat collection ===
The museum&#x27;s boat display consists of boats that it owns, are on loan or have mooring agreements.

==Transport collection==

The size of the museum site provides the opportunity to demonstrate many of the road transport exhibits which were both used and made in the Black Country.

===Trams===
*Dudley, Stourbridge and District Electric Traction Company No. 5 Tividale single-decker built in 1920. This was the museum&#x27;s first tram. It has worked much more at the museum than for its original owners. Returned to service in December 2017 after a £120,000 overhaul.

*Midland Red BMMO D9 6342 HA built in 1963. Operational following completion of restoration in 2007.
*Guy Motors KTT 689 built in 1948 and delivered new to Court of Torquay. Operational.
*West Bromwich Corporation Dennis E-Type EA 4181 built in 1929.
===Trolleybuses===

The museum operates a trolleybus service on certain days, unlike the tram which is usually operated seven days a week. The route is one of the few double deck trolley bus services left in the world, as most of the world&#x27;s trolley buses are single deckers.

The museum&#x27;s fleet numbers three resident trolleybuses from the Black Country&#x27;s two former trolley bus networks, and one which has been painted to resemble a local trolleybus. Unlike Birmingham&#x27;s tram service, Birmingham Corporation Trolley Buses never operated in the Black Country. The Resident Fleet is listed below;

*Wolverhampton Corporation Transport 78 – A Guy built 1931 Trolleybus that still requires restoration.
*Wolverhampton Corporation Transport 433 – A Sunbeam with body work by C. H. Roe, this time a W4 built in 1946 which was retired with the rest of Wolverhampton&#x27;s trolley buses in 1967. Operational.
*Bradford Corporation Transport 735 - A Karrier W built in 1946. Though it worked with Bradford for all its working life, it has been painted in Walsall Corporation blue in order to resemble trolleybuses that would have operated nearby. Operational. 
*Walsall Corporation Transport 862 – Another Sunbeam F4A with a Willowbrook Body, it was built in 1955 and retired from Walsall in 1970 on the closure of the trolleybus network. Operational.

===Motor cars===
Wolverhampton was home to some early manufacturers of motor cars, such as Sunbeam, Clyno, AJS and Star. Frisky cars were also made in Wolverhampton, while the Black Country town of Kingswinford is home to Westfield cars.

The museum collection includes a 1903 Sunbeam, a 1912 Star and a 1931 AJS as well as examples of later vehicles such as the Kieft, Frisky and Westfield Topaz.

===Motorcycles===
There are approximately 40 motorcycles in the museum&#x27;s collection, all of which were made in the Black Country. A large proportion were manufactured by Sunbeam and AJS, but there are also examples by firms such as Wearwell Cycle Company and Rockson. The museum is affiliated to the British Motorcycle Charitable Trust.

===Other vehicles===
The museum does not have an extensive collection of Black Country bicycles, but there are examples by manufacturers such as Harry Albino and Star.

Unusual vehicles in the fleet include a 1924 Guy-Morris fire engine, a Model T Ford van used by Willenhall firm Brevitt&#x27;s and a Bean of Tipton flatbed truck.

==Other collections==

In addition to the wide range of displayed collections, the museum has extensive research collections held in store. These include historic objects, archival material and library books, all of which can be viewed by appointment.

== Filming location ==
The museum has been used as a set for many film and television productions, particularly the first season of &quot;Rosie &amp; Jim&quot; and the BBC dramas &quot;WPC 56&quot; and &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;. &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot;, a feature film on the life of Laurel and Hardy, shot some of its scenes on the museum&#x27;s 1930s Street.

== Future plans ==
On 15 June 2017 it was announced that the museum had been awarded £9.8 million from the National Lottery towards their £21.7m project BCLM: Forging Ahead, which will allow the museum to tell the story of the Black Country up to the closure of the Baggeridge Coal Mine in 1968. Plans include the translocation, recreation or replication at the Museum of Wolverhampton&#x27;s Elephant &amp; Castle pub, Dudley&#x27;s Burgin&#x27;s Newsagents, a hairdressers, an NHS clinic, West Bromwich Gas Showroom and Dudley&#x27;s Woodside Library, and a butchers all dating from the 1940s to the 1960s. The new plans will see the museum space increase by one third. The plans were due to be completed in 2022. It is expected that 60 jobs would be created directly as a result of the expansion.

<doc id="375653" wikidata="Q74609" url="?curid=375653" title="Przemysł I of Greater Poland">
<text>Przemysł I (4 June 1221 – 4 June 1257), a member of the Piast dynasty, was Duke of Greater Poland from 1239 until his death, from 1241 with his brother Bolesław the Pious as co-ruler. He was able to re-acquire large parts of Greater Poland, ruling as Duke of Poznań and Gniezno from 1247 and, upon several inheritance conflicts with his brother, as Duke of Poznań and Kalisz from 1249, sole Duke of Greater Poland from 1250, and Duke of Poznań from 1253 until his death.

The numeral &quot;primus&quot; (&quot;The First&quot;) was given to him in the almost contemporary &quot;Wielkopolska Chronicle&quot;.

==Life and rule==
He was the eldest son of the Greater Polish duke Władysław Odonic by his wife Jadwiga (&quot;Jadwiga&quot;), who was likely a daughter of the Samboride duke Mestwin I of Pomerania, or a member of the Bohemian Přemyslid dynasty (a supposition supported by the name given to her son, the first in the Piast dynasty who bears it), or of the Bavarian House of Andechs. Duke Władysław Odonic ordered that his son be given a comprehensive education; as attested in the &quot;Wielkopolska Chronicle&quot;, young Przemysł was able to read Latin psalms with ease.

===Beginning of his government===

Przemysł first appears in official documents signed by his father from 1232 onward, and after Władysław Odonic&#x27;s death on 5 June 1239 he began his own rule, during the time of Fragmentation of Poland (1138 - ca. 1314). Two years later (in 1241), Przemysł approved his younger brother Bolesław as an official co-ruler, though this was merely a formality. In reality Przemysł reigned alone.

The principality inherited from his father was composed of northern Greater Poland, which included Ujście and Nakło (although some historians believe that Władysław Odonic lost Ujście and Nakło before his death). Subsequently, he strove to recover the remaining part of Greater Poland. In 1241, after the death of his Silesian cousin High Duke Henry II the Pious at the 1241 Battle of Legnica, Przemysł recovered Poznań and Gniezno, and subsequently managed to conquer also the parts of Greater Poland previously controlled by Dukes of Silesia.

===Reconquest of lost lands===
In 1242 Przemysł I reconquered Zbąszyń and Międzyrzecz from Bolesław II the Bald. The presence of Przemysł in Silesia forced the intervention of Duke Swantopolk II of Pomerania, who captured Nakło. However Przemysł quickly took back the control of the district from the Pomeranian ruler.

Despite his success, Przemysł sought to end his disputes with the Silesian Piasts and in 1244 he married Bolesław II&#x27;s sister Elizabeth, at the monastery in Trzebnica. Contrary to his plans, this marriage did not calm the situation on the Silesian-Greater Poland border, but it did allow Przemysł to recover Kalisz from Duke Władysław of Opole. He failed however in his attempt to recover Wieluń, which was only annexed to Greater Poland in 1249. The actions against the sons of Henry II the Pious were completed in 1247 when Santok was recovered.

===War in Greater Poland against the opposition, fight with the Silesian Piasts===
In 1247 Przemysł I was forced by the local knights to give his brother Bolesław the district of Kalisz as a separated Duchy, but in foreign policy he retained full authority over Greater Poland. It was not the final division. A year later, the ruler of Greater Poland crushed the opposition by imprisoning its leaders, the Castellan of Poznań Thomas of Nałęczów and his sons. Przemysł I released them in 1250, when he was involved in the conflict between Bolesław II the Bald and his brother Konrad (husband of Przemysł I&#x27;s sister Salomea). The intervention of the Greater Poland Duke helped Konrad to obtain the district of Głogów as his own independent Duchy.

In 1249 Przemysł I exchanged again territories with his brother, giving him Gniezno and becoming Duke of Poznań and Kalisz. In 1250, for unknown reasons, Przemysł had Bolesław arrested, becoming in this way the sole ruler of Greater Poland (Poznań, Gniezno and Kalisz). Only at Easter of 1253, after the Church intervention, the brothers were finally reconciled and Bolesław received the Duchy of Kalisz-Gniezno.

During the first half of the 13th century, Przemysł I promoted a more peaceful policy, working closely with his brother-in-law Konrad I of Głogów and giving his sister Euphemia in marriage to Duke Władysław of Opole. Also, he received the help of his brother Bolesław with troops against Duke Casimir I of Kuyavia for the possession of Ladzka. In 1254 he organized an armed expedition against Henry III the White, destroying part of the Bishopric of Wrocław goods (i.e. Oleśnica), for which Przemysł I was excommunicated, and the penalty was only removed after the Greater Poland Duke repaired the damages in the Church states. The next campaign against Henry III was launched in September of the same year, but this time the joint expedition of Przemysł I, his brother Bolesław and Konrad I of Głogów avoided damages of Church goods.

===War against Brandenburgian expansion===
In foreign policy, Duke Przemysł&#x27;s main concern was the expansionism of the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg in the west. Although he stopped the advance of Brandenburg troops into his domains (Santok in 1247, Zbąszyń in 1251 and Drezdenko in 1252), the situation remained tense on the western border. To address this problem, between 1254 and 1255 Przemysł I tried to establish warmer relations with the House of Ascania through the betrothal of his eldest daughter Constance with Conrad, son of Margrave John I (the marriage took place after Przemysł I&#x27;s death, in 1260). However, this strategy ultimately back-fired politically as the Ascanians used the marriage to claim rights over the western region of Greater Poland as their &quot;New March&quot;.

===Poznań, capital of Greater Poland===
In 1253 Przemysł I chose as his capital the city of Poznań, situated on the left bank of the Warta River. He also began the building of the Royal Castle on the hill overlooking the town.

==Religious policy==
The political line of Przemysł was based on closer cooperation with the Church (especially the Bishops of Poznań, Bogufał II and Bogufał III) which caused the opposition of the knighthood. In 1244 local knights rebelled against him and tried to abolish the judicial and tax immunity gained by the Bishops from Władysław Odonic. Przemysł initially accepted the request, but in 1252 he reestablished the former privilege, and even expanded them even further.

Despite periodic troubles with his lay subjects, Przemysł I had the support of a large group of trusted advisers, such as the Governor of Poznań Przedpełk Łódź , the castellan of Poznań Boguchwał, the Judge Domarat Grzymalita, and the master of the hunt Pakosław Awdaniec.

On 8 May 1254 Przemysł took part in the national Congress of Piast princes at Kraków which convened for the canonization of St. Stanislaus. Among the princes who participated were his brother Bolesław, Casimir I of Kuyavia, Siemowit I of Masovia, Władysław of Opole and the host, Bolesław V the Chaste. The establishment of friendly contacts with his relatives proved useful one year later, when Duke Mestwin II of Pomerania captured the district of Nakło. After the following war Przemysł was only able to recover Nakło after paying 500 pieces of silver in 1256.

==Death==
Przemysł I died in Poznań on 4 June 1257 and was buried in the Wawel Cathedral. The head was displayed in the vault of the Church of Holiest Heart of Jesus and Mother of God of Consolation in Poznań. A painting in the Historical Museum of Poznań City Hall is believed to be Przemysł I&#x27;s portrait, but this has been questioned by art historians.

==Marriage and children==
In 1244 Przemysł I married with Elisabeth (ca. 1232 – 16 January 1265), daughter of Henry II the Pious, Duke of Wrocław. They had:
# Constance (1245/46 – 8 October 1281), married in 1260 to Conrad, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal.
# Euphrosyne (1247/50 – 17/19 February 1298), Abbess of St. Clara in Trzebnica.
# Anna (1253 – aft. 26 June 1295), Abbess at Owińska.
# Euphemia (1253 – 5 September 1298), twin of Anna; a nun at St. Clara, Wrocław.
# Przemysł II (posthumously, 14 October 1257 – 8 February 1296).

At the time of Przemysł I&#x27;s death, his wife was five months pregnant with their last child. His brother Bolesław took over the government of all his domains. After his birth, young Przemysł II remained under the tutelage of his uncle until 1273, when he received Poznań as his own district. Eventually, Przemysł II inherited the whole of Greater Poland after his uncle&#x27;s death in 1279, subsequently becoming King of Poland in 1295. With his death one year later, the Greater Poland branch of the Piast dynasty, descendants of Duke Mieszko III the Old became extinct.

<text>Dover is a town in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 5,923 at the time of the 2020 United States Census. With a median household income of more than $250,000, Dover is the wealthiest town in Massachusetts.

Located about southwest of downtown Boston, Dover is a residential town nestled on the south banks of the Charles River. Almost all of the residential zoning requires or larger. As recently as the early 1960s, 75% of its annual town budget was allocated to snow removal, as only of the town&#x27;s roads are state highway.

Dover is bordered by Natick, Wellesley and Needham to the north, Westwood to the east, Walpole and Medfield to the south, and Sherborn to the west.

For geographic and demographic information on the census-designated place Dover, please see the article Dover (CDP), Massachusetts.

The &quot;Dover Demon&quot; is a creature reportedly sighted on April 21 and 22, 1977.

== History ==

The first recorded settlement of Dover was in 1640. It was later established as the Springfield Parish of Dedham in 1748, and incorporated as District Dedham in 1784. Dover was officially incorporated as a town in 1836.

The Benjamin Caryl House, at 107 Dedham St., dates from about 1777 and was the home of Dover&#x27;s first minister, Benjamin Caryl, his son George, who was the town&#x27;s first doctor, and their descendants until 1897. It has been owned by the town and operated by the Historical Society since 1920. The house retains its architectural integrity and has been carefully restored to reflect life in the 1790s when the first two Caryl families lived and worked there together.

The Sawin Building has housed thousands of Dover relics, books, photographs and artifacts since the beginning of the 20th century. Benjamin and Eudora Sawin willed land and funds into the Dover Historical Society along with their old household goods so that the building could be erected, and it was dedicated on May 14, 1907, by members and friends of the society. In the early years, it was used for meetings and to house Dover&#x27;s historical memorabilia, but eventually members became disenchanted with the society and the building was seldom opened. In the 1960s, there was a renewed interest which led to the general overhaul and refurbishing of the building. The Sawin Museum, located at the corner of Centre and Dedham Streets in Dover Center, is owned and operated by the Dover Historical Society and is open to the public free of charge.

==Education==

Dover&#x27;s public schools are considered among the best in Massachusetts. According to research conducted by &quot;Boston&quot; magazine in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the town&#x27;s schools scored No. 1 in the state. Dover has three public schools: Chickering Elementary School (grades K–5), Dover-Sherborn Middle School (grades 6–8) and Dover-Sherborn High School (grades 9–12). The private, independent Charles River School (grades Pre-K–8) is located in the town&#x27;s center.

Located near Caryl Park and the entrance to Noanet Woodlands (also known as Miss Peabody&#x27;s Woods), Chickering School is under the elected Dover School Committee, while the two secondary schools are the responsibility of the regional school system, under the elected Dover-Sherborn Regional School Committee, with costs and governance shared with the neighboring town of Sherborn. The regional schools share a campus on Farm Street in Dover, near the borders with Sherborn and Medfield.

Dover-Sherborn High School has impressive results with regards to graduation rates, college admission rates and standardized and Advanced Placement exam scores. DSHS was ranked third in cost efficiency and seventh in academic performance by &quot;Boston&quot; magazine. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; named Dover-Sherborn a Gold Medal School, ranking it 65th in the US.

Dover used to have two elementary schools, Chickering for grades K to 3, and Caryl Elementary School for grades 4 to 6. In 1970, Caryl School was gutted by fire. It was rebuilt and remained open until finally being closed in 2001 after the expansion of Chickering.

==Dover Sun House==
Dover Sun House was one of the world&#x27;s first solar-heated houses, it was designed in 1948 by architect Eleanor Raymond and had a unique heating system developed by physicist Mária Telkes. The project was funded by philanthropist and sculptor Amelia Peabody, and built on her property in Dover, Massachusetts. Dover Sun House was demolished in 2010.

== Popular culture ==

The town is known for the sighting of a humanoid since the 1970s on Farm Street, which gives access to it. There have been six unrelated sightings so far. The creature has a large and long head, epidermis without fur beyond feet and long hands that fix on the surface. It was named the Dover Demon by one of the cryptozoologists who investigated the case. Although some believe it is an alien, to others it is no more than an animal like a primate. There have been no modern reports.

<doc id="375660" wikidata="Q2452949" url="?curid=375660" title="Bolesław the Pious">
<text>Bolesław the Pious (1224/27 – 14 April 1279) was a Duke of Greater Poland during 1239–1247 (according to some historians during 1239–1241, sole Duke of Ujście), Duke of Kalisz during 1247–1249, Duke of Gniezno during 1249–1250, Duke of Gniezno-Kalisz during 1253–1257, Duke of the whole of Greater Poland and Poznań during 1257–1273, in 1261 ruler over Ląd, regent of the Duchies of Mazovia, Płock and Czersk during 1262–1264, ruler over Bydgoszcz during 1268–1273, Duke of Inowrocław during 1271–1273, and Duke of Gniezno-Kalisz from 1273 until his death.

He was the second son of Władysław Odonic, Duke of Greater Poland by his wife Jadwiga, who was probably the daughter of Mestwin I, Duke of Pomerania, or a member of the Přemyslid dynasty. His name was very popular in the Piast dynasty, so it&#x27;s unknown exactly after whom he was named. Very soon Bolesław received the nickname of &quot;the Pious&quot; (Latin: &quot;Pius&quot;, ), given to him during his lifetime by the &quot;Chronicle of the Chapter of Poznań&quot;. In 1264, Bolesław granted the first written privilege to the Jews of Greater Poland.

==Early years==
The first years of Bolesław saw him share the fierce dispute of his father against Władysław III Spindleshanks (his own uncle) for his inheritance. However, Władysław Odonic took care properly for the upbringing of his offspring, evidenced by the fact that Bolesław, like his older brother Przemysł I, was able to read and write Latin.

==Guardianship of Przemysł I==

Because Bolesław was a minor when Władysław Odonic died on 5 June 1239, his elder brother Przemysł I ruled alone at first. Historians agree the territory the brothers inherited started out small, but disagree as to whether it extended beyond Ujście and Nakło in northern Poland. In 1241, Przemysł and Boleslaw began reclaiming the lands their father had lost. By 1243 the brothers regained most of the Duchies of Poznań and Gniezno, in 1244 Kalisz, in 1247 Santok, and in 1249 Wieluń. In 1244, Bolesław supported his brother in a conflict between the local nobility and the clergy led by the Bishop of Poznań Bogufał II for the privileges their father had granted shortly before his death. On 24 April 1245 Przemysł I acknowledged Boleslaw&#x27;s coming of age by knighting him during a solemn Mass in honor of St. Adalbert of Prague in Gniezno, celebrated by Archbishop Pełka Liz.

The indivisibility of the Duchy was not to Bolesław&#x27;s liking, and in 1247 he persuaded his brother Przemysł I to provide territory for his sole leadership: the land between the Prosna River and Przemęt, north of the Warta River and thence to the Odra River; in short it was the Duchy of Kalisz. This division, though rather unjust for Bolesław, was approved by the Church, and after he protested, he was threatened with the excommunication. Despite the fact that he now had his own district, Bolesław did not pursue a foreign policy; this would continue to be the responsibility of his brother. This was revealed during the dispute with Duke Casimir I of Kuyavia regarding the possession of Ladzka, which was given to him by Henry II the Pious as a dowry for his daughter Constance, Casimir I&#x27;s second wife. This decision was not recognized by Władysław Odonic&#x27;s sons, but eventually they reconciled and even signed an alliance with the Kuyavian Duke, which effectively ended any attempt to change the ownership of the disputed land.

In 1249 Bolesław, dissatisfied with the tutelage of his older brother, persuaded him to make a new division of their patrimony. He received the Duchies of Kalisz and Gniezno, with the addition of Wieluń, which had recently been returned to the rule of Władysław Odonic&#x27;s sons. This new division was apparently made peacefully, because later in that same year the brothers together gave support to Konrad I of Głogów against his brother Bolesław II the Bald. However, on 19 May 1250 an unexplained event took place, which was related in the &quot;Chronicle of Greater Poland&quot;:

::&quot;Przemysł captured his brother Bolesław and took all his lands and castles.&quot;

The conflict certainly was not trivial, since Bolesław did not regain his freedom until 20 April 1253, thanks to the pressures of the powerful Greater Poland clergy. The final reconciliation between the brothers occurred in May of that year at a meeting in Pogorzelica near Giecz, where thanks to the mediation of Pełka, the Archbishop of Gniezno Bolesław recovered his Duchy of Kalisz-Gniezno. After that the brothers cooperated without problems, but Bolesław was still removed from the foreign policy of Greater Poland. On 8 May 1254, Bolesław took part in the national Congress of Piast princes at Kraków on the occasion of the canonization of St. Stanislaus, where they decided to form a coalition against Swantopolk II, Duke of Pomerania. Among the princes who participated were his brother Przemysł I, Casimir I of Kuyavia, Siemowit I of Masovia, Władysław of Opole and Bolesław V the Chaste. In September of that year Bolesław participated in an expedition against Henry III the White launched by his brother and Konrad I of Głogów.

==Sole rulership==
===Foreign policy===
On 4 June 1257 Przemysł I died, aged only 36. With his brother&#x27;s death, new horizons opened to Bolesław. He became in the undisputed sole ruler over the whole of Greater Poland. Although the posthumous son of his brother, Przemysł II, was born on 14 October of that year, Boleslaw was his guardian until he was declared an adult. The first of Bolesław&#x27;s new foreign politics was his marriage in 1258 to Princess Jolenta (Helena), daughter of King Béla IV of Hungary. This union resulted in a permanent bond between Bolesław and Hungary, reflected in the assistance given in the conflict with Bohemia after the extinction of the House of Babenberg. For Bolesław, this alliance cost him the devastation of Greater Poland during the winter of 1267-1268 by troops of King Ottokar II of Bohemia during his return from an expedition against the Prussians. One of the stages of this war was also the trip taken by Bolesław together with Bolesław V the Chaste and Leszek II the Black in the autumn of 1273 in order to visit Władysław of Opole, an ally of the Přemyslid dynasty.

===Relations with Masovia and Kuyavia===
During 1258-1261 Bolesław was involved in a long and destructive war against Casimir I of Kuyavia and his ally Swantopolk II for the castellanie of Ladzka. To this end, the Greater Poland Duke allied with Wartislaw III, Duke of Pomerania-Demmin, Siemowit I of Masovia, Bolesław V the Chaste and Roman Danylovich, Prince of Navahradak. The war ended in a full victory and Ladzka returned to Greater Poland. The formal treaty was signed on 29 November 1259; however, Casimir I delayed in fulfilled the provisions of the agreement, which led in 1261 to a new military expedition.

On 23 June 1262 Siemowit I was killed at the hands of the Lithuanian troops and his eldest son Konrad II was taken prisoner. Both Konrad II and his younger brother Bolesław II were minors at that time; for this reason, Bolesław became regent of their domains (Duchies of Masovia, Płock and Czersk) for the next two years, until 1264, when Konrad II obtain his freedom and return to Masovia.

In 1268 Bolesław interfered again in the Kuyavian affairs. Casimir I&#x27;s son, Duke Ziemomysł of Inowrocław, followed a policy of close contacts with the Teutonic Order and Duke Sambor II of Pomerania, who became in his father-in-law. This caused a deep dissatisfaction among the local nobility, who called on Bolesław for help. The Duke of Greater Poland quickly took Radziejów, Kruszwica and the castle in Bydgoszcz; however, rapid action by Ziemomysł regained temporary control of this lands.

Despite this success, Ziemomysł continued with his German-Pomeranian politics, which caused a new revolt by his subjects, who called again Bolesław for help: in 1271 he invaded the Duchy of Inowrocław and forced Ziemomysł to flee. Bolesław retained the Duchy until 1273, when he gave it to Ziemomysł&#x27;s brother Leszek II the Black, except for Radziejów and Kruszwica, which remained in Greater Poland.

===War against Brandenburg===
From the beginning of his sole rule, Bolesław established contacts with the Margraviate of Brandenburg, ruled by the House of Ascania; in this, he followed the policy of his brother Przemysł I, who even betrothed his eldest daughter Constance with Conrad, son of Margrave John I. Three years after Przemysł I&#x27;s death (in 1260), Constance and Conrad were formally married. As a dowry, Brandenburg received the castellany of Santok (but without the important main city) with the consent of a &quot;wiec&quot; reunited in Greater Poland, which took place on 1 July 1260 in Poznań.

However, the expected peace due to this marriage was short-lived. In early 1265 Brandenburg occupied the main city of Santok and broke the previous agreement. Thanks to an immediate diplomatic intervention, Bolesław soon signed a new treaty with Brandenburg, under which Greater Poland burned the fortress built in Drezdenko, and Brandenburg also burned his fortress in Santok. But in 1269 war with Brandenburg erupted again. They built a fortress in Sulęcin, and in response Bolesław did the same thing in Międzyrzecz. The invasion of Międzyrzecz launched by the Margraves of Brandenburg was successfully repulsed by Bolesław, who in December 1269 could advance to Lubusz and in addition, during this expedition burned several fortresses, included the one newly built in Sulęcin. Both sides made a new agreement and were restored the fortress in Santok (from Brandenburg) and Drezdenko (from Greater Poland). The latter was captured by Brandenburg in 1270. For this reason, in the spring of 1271 Bolesław organized a major military expedition against Santok and Neumark, ravaging this land terribly, but he could not recover the lost domains.

The war with the House of Ascania wasn&#x27;t limited to the border areas of Greater Poland. By 1272 Bolesław entered in an alliance with Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania-Gdańsk; one year later (in 1273), he renewed his homage to Brandenburg and promised his help to the Margraviate against all his enemies, except the Duke of Greater Poland. In the same year was launched another expedition against Brandenburg. Although nominal leadership of the troops was given by Bolesław to his young nephew Przemysł II, the expedition was actually headed by experienced commanders such as the voivode of Poznań, Przedpełk Łodzia, and the castellan of Kalisz Janek. They successfully reconquered both Drezdenko and Strzelce. The last campaign against Brandenburg during Bolesław&#x27;s lifetime took in the summer of 1278, when Greater Poland troops advanced to Myślibórz and eventually recovered Santok.

===Internal policy===
Bolesław continued the policy of Przemysł I and maintained in their positions the nobles appointed by him. He also developed good relations with the Church while also trying to influence the appointment of the most important religious posts. His generosity to the clergy, allowed the Franciscans to establish a post in 1259 in Gniezno. Also during his rule the monastery of Poor Clares in Gniezno was started, which remained unfinished even at the time of Przemysł II&#x27;s death.

On 16 August 1264 Bolesław granted the first written privilege to the Jews of Greater Poland (the &quot;Statute of Kalisz&quot;). It regulated the judicial authority over the Jewish population, and Jewish credit and trading activity. The comparatively liberal statute served as a basis for Jewish privileges in Poland until 1795.

===Last years===
In 1273, after the victorious expedition against Brandenburg, Przemysł II began to claim his own separated Duchy. Unable to face the powerful pressure, Bolesław agreed to this and given his nephew the district of Poznań. To bind Przemysł II with his politics, Bolesław arranged the marriage of his nephew with Ludgarda, daughter of Henry I the Pilgrim, Lord of Mecklenburg. In addition, Ludgarda was a granddaughter of Duke Barnim I of Pomerania, and thanks to this union the alliance with Western Pomerania was reinforced. Dukes of Greater Poland political path, however, soon spread, as Przemysł II became involved with Henry IV Probus, and Bolesław, using the imprisonment of Henry IV in 1277, tried to force financial concessions. Bolesław supported this policy with the marriage of his firstborn daughter Elisabeth with Henry V the Fat, Duke of Legnica.

Bolesław died on 14 April 1279 in Kalisz and was buried in the Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul in Poznań.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1258 Bolesław married Jolenta (Helena) (b. 1244 – d. 16/17 June aft. 1304), daughter of King Béla IV of Hungary. They had:
#Elisabeth (b. 1261/63 – d. September 1304), married in 1273 to Henry V, Duke of Legnica.
#Jadwiga (b. 1270/75 – d. 10 December 1339), married in January 1293 to Władysław I the Elbow-high, Duke of Kuyavia and after 1320 King of Poland.
#Anna (b. 1276/78 – d. bef. 1300), a nun in Gniezno.

After Bolesław died without male heirs, all of the Greater Poland Duchy passed to his only nephew Przemysł II, who was crowned King of Poland in 1295 but murdered the following year. With his death the Greater Poland branch of the Piast dynasty became extinct.

<text>Clarice Cliff (20 January 1899 – 23 October 1972) was an English ceramic artist and designer. Active from 1922 to 1963, Cliff became the head of the Newport Pottery factory creative department.

== Early life ==
Cliff&#x27;s ancestors moved from the Eccleshall area to Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, around 1725. Cliff was born on the terrace of a modest house in Meir Street on 20 January 1899. Her father, Harry Thomas Cliff, worked at an iron foundry in Tunstall. Her mother Ann (née Machin) washed clothes to supplement the family income. They had seven children.

Cliff was sent to a different school than her siblings. After school, she would visit her aunt, who was a hand-painter. She made papier-mâché models at school for a local pottery company.

At age 13, Cliff started working in the pottery industry as a gilder. She added gold lines on pottery of traditional design. Later, she learned freehand painting at another potbank. She also studied art and sculpture at the Burslem School of Art.

==Early career==

In 1916, Cliff relocated to the factory of A.J. Wilkinson in Newport, Burslem, to increase her career opportunities. Most of the young women in the Staffordshire Potteries would continue working in the area of the task they had first mastered in order to raise their income above the rate of &#x27;apprentice wages&#x27;. Cliff chose not to follow this traditional path; instead she acquired many skills, such as modeling figurines and vases, gilding, keeping pattern books, and hand-painting ware. Hand-painting included outlining, enameling and banding (drawing radial bands on plates or vessels). In the early 1920s, decorating manager Jack Walker brought Cliff to the attention of one of the factory owners, Arthur Colley Austin Shorter. Shorter nurtured her skills in ceramics and gave her space to explore her own ideas. He was married, but later married Cliff after his wife died (Cliff and Shorter were married in December 1940). Over time, Cliff developed her skills and studied at the Royal College of Art and visited Paris.
In various styles, the first printed &#x27;Bizarre&#x27; back stamp was used on Clarice Cliff ware from 1928 to early 1936. Cliff was given a second apprenticeship at the age of 25 (1924). She worked at A.J. Wilkinson&#x27;s, primarily as a &#x27;modeler&#x27; and worked alongside factory designers John Butler and Fred Ridgway. They produced conservative, Victorian-style ware. Eventually, Cliff&#x27;s wide range of skills was recognized, and in 1927 she was given a studio at the adjoining Newport Pottery, which Arthur Colley Austin Shorter had bought in 1920. Here, Cliff was allowed to decorate some of the old defective glost ware in her freehand patterns. She used on-glaze enamel colours for these, which enabled a brighter palette than underglaze colours.

She covered the imperfections in simple patterns of triangles, in a style that she called &#x27;Bizarre.&#x27; The earliest examples had a hand-painted mark, usually in a rust-coloured paint: &#x27;Bizarre by Clarice Cliff,&quot; she wrote, and sometimes she added &#x27;Newport Pottery&#x27; underneath. To the surprise of the company&#x27;s senior salesman Ewart Oakes, it was immediately popular when he took a carload to a major stockist. Clarice was joined by young painter, Gladys Scarlett, who helped her with the ware. Soon, a more professional back stamp was made, which showed Cliff&#x27;s facsimile signature, and proclaimed &quot;Hand Painted Bizarre by Clarice Cliff, Newport Pottery England.&quot;

This back stamp led to &quot;Bizarre&quot; being used as an umbrella name for her entire pattern range, so the factory had to refer to the first pieces with the simple triangles as &quot;Original Bizarre&quot;.

In March 1927 Shorter sent Cliff to the Royal College of Art in Kensington, for two brief periods of study in March and May. These dates are recorded in the Royal College of Art archive and were also remembered by Gladys Scarlett in 1982, as she was briefly left alone at Newport to paint the new &#x27;Bizarre&#x27; ware.

Starting in 1927, Cliff was credited for shapes she designed, such as her &quot;Viking Boat&quot; flower holder, though her modeling for the factory is recorded in the trade journal only as far back as 1923–24. From 1929 onward, the shapes took on a more &#x27;Modern&#x27; influence. They were often angular and geometric, and some got, what was to be later termed Art Deco, designs. Abstract and cubist patterns appeared on these shapes, such as the 1929 &quot;Ravel&quot; (seen on Cliff&#x27;s Conical shape ware), which was an abstract leaf and flower pattern named after the composer. The image shows a conical coffee pot as well as a sugar bowl and cream holder with four triangular feet, another of Cliff&#x27;s Bizarre shape ideas which proved popular with 1930s customers. &quot;Ravel&quot; produced between 1929 and at least as late as 1935.

In 1928, Cliff produced a simple, hand painted pattern of &quot;Crocus&quot; flowers in orange, blue and purple. Each flower was constructed with confident upward strokes and then green leaves were added by holding the piece upside down and painting thin lines amongst the flowers. The &quot;Crocus&quot; pattern was completely hand-painted, and the vibrant colors led to large sales.
Initially, Cliff had just one young decorator produce &quot;Crocus,&quot; Ethel Barrow. But by 1930, a separate decorating shop was established underneath the top floor of the building which housed the &#x27;Bizarre&#x27; shop, and Ethel trained young painters on how to paint the pattern. Twenty young women painted nothing but &quot;Crocus&quot; for 5½ days a week for much of the 1930s. &quot;Crocus&quot; was unusual because it was produced on tableware, tea and coffee ware, and &#x27;fancies&#x27; (which included novelty items made primarily as gift ware). The pattern had many colour variations, including &quot;Purple Crocus&quot; (1932), &quot;Blue Crocus&quot; (1935), &quot;Sungleam Crocus&quot; (1935), and &quot;Spring Crocus&quot;. &quot;Crocus&quot; continued to be produced after WW2, and the final pieces with &quot;Clarice Cliff&quot; marks were made in 1963. However, Midwinter bought the factory and continued to paint the pieces to order until as late as 1968.

By 1929, Cliff&#x27;s decorators had grown to a team of around 70 young painters. Of those, 66 were women (called &#x27;Bizarre girls&#x27;) and 4 were boys. Many of these workers were traced in the 1980s and 1990s and they totalled over 100. Their names and work for Clarice Cliff were recorded in the centenary book.

The factory produced a series of small color printed leaflets (quite unusual for this time) which could be obtained by post, or from stockists. This promotional device was successful, and one young girl&#x27;s only task was to put the leaflets in stamped self-addressed envelopes sent to the factory. At this time, many women would buy pottery by mail order picked from advertising magazines. The series of leaflets, each of which covered a range of pieces in a similar style or set of colours, included the patterns &quot;Bizarre, Fantasque, Delecia, Appliqué, Inspiration, Crocus &amp; Gayday,&quot; but contained other design patterns as well. The original leaflet for the &quot;Appliqué&quot; patterns featured just two, &quot;Lucerne&quot; and &quot;Lugano&quot;, but Cliff&#x27;s career witnessed 14 &quot;Appliqué&quot; patterns that had been designed by 1932: &quot;Avignon, Windmill, Red Tree, Idyll, Palermo, Blossom, Caravan, Bird of Paradise, Etna, Garden, Eden&quot; and &quot;Monsoon&quot; in addition to the original two.
The &quot;Fantasque&quot; range evolved between 1928 and 1934 and mainly featured abstracts or landscapes of cottages and trees, as well as some Art Deco inspired patterns. The first &quot;Fantasque&quot; landscape pattern was &quot;Trees and House,&quot; which sold well from 1930 until at least 1934. However, it was the slightly later, more sophisticated &quot;Autumn&quot; pattern issued near the end of 1930 which was more popular. Originally created in red, coral-green and black, from 1930 to 1931 many colourway variations appeared. The rarest is the red colourway, shown on a wall plaque. The best selling version at the time was one with trees in blue, green and yellow. All these variations are collectables.

==The 1930s==
In 1930, Cliff was appointed as art director at Newport Pottery and A. J. Wilkinson, the two adjoining factories that produced her wares. Her work involved spending more time with Colley Shorter, and this gradually developed into an affair, conducted in secrecy. The couple worked closely together on creating awareness of &#x27;Bizarre ware&#x27; to catch the attention of buyers in the middle of a major financial depression. Colley Shorter registered Clarice&#x27;s name and even some of her shapes. It was her ability to design both patterns and the shapes they were to go on that distinguished Cliff above any other designers in the Staffordshire Potteries at this time. Her first modelling in the mid 20s was of stylised figures, people, ducks, the floral embossed &quot;Davenport&quot; ware of 1925. But in 1929 at the same time as she started the colourful cubist and landscape designs, Cliff&#x27;s modeling took on a new style. This was influenced by European originals by Désny, Tétard Freres, Josef Hoffmann and others, that she had seen in design journals including &#x27;Mobilier e Décoration&#x27;.
Between 1929 and 1935 Cliff issued a mass of shape ranges, including &quot;Conical&quot; (see photo below), &quot;Bon Jour/Biarritz, Stamford, Eton, Daffodil&quot; and &quot;Trieste&quot;. In each of these there were tea and coffee ware shapes, but the first two were so popular that biscuit barrels, sugar sifters, bowls and vases were issued to enlarge the range. &quot;Bon Jour&quot; had 20 shapes created during 1933, with about 10 more being added in 1934. There were also many other vases, bowls and &#x27;fancies&#x27;, such as the &quot;Liner vase&quot;, &quot;Flower tube vase&quot; and the (now rare) &quot;Lido Lady&quot; ashtray and &quot;Age of Jazz&quot; musicians and dancers.

Through the depths of the Great Depression Cliff&#x27;s wares continued to sell in volume at what were high prices for the time. Her &quot;Bizarre&quot; and &quot;Fantasque&quot; ware was sold throughout North America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, but not in mainland Europe. In Britain many top London stores sold it, including Harrods. Some of the other London stockists have long since closed, but the list is impressive: &quot;&amp; Co., Lawley&#x27;s, Bon Marche, John Lewis Peter Robinson, Selfridges, John Barker &amp; Co., Warring &amp; Gillow and Gorringe&#x27;s&quot;. However, the extant order books of the period confirm that Bizarre ware was never sold at Woolworths as some have erroneously stated.

Further vividly colored patterns, such as &quot;Melon&quot; and &quot;Circle Tree&quot; appeared in 1930. Cliff devised many ways of marketing these: in-store painting demonstrations, for which Cliff chose just the prettiest of her painters and most famously she and Shorter had the idea to actually pay major 1930s celebrities to endorse the ware. This was done both in magazine articles and by appearances at large stores. The celebrities included &quot;actresses Adrianne Allen, Marion Lorne, Marie Tempest, the BBC presenter Christopher Stone and musical comedy star Bobby Howes&quot;. Sir Malcolm Campbell who had just broken the world land speed record appeared at a promotion at the First Avenue Hotel, London in 1930.

Cliff&#x27;s worldwide impact was made clear by a story in the &quot;Pasadena Evening Post&quot; in the US. It pictured her with a five-foot-high &#x27;horse&#x27; made entirely of Bizarre ware which had been made to promote the ware in Britain. It was in this article, that Cliff made what has become her most famous quote: &quot;Having a little fun at my work does not make me any less of an artist, and people who appreciate truly beautiful and original creations in pottery are not frightened by innocent tomfoolery.&quot;

Between 1932 and 1934 Cliff was the art director for a major project involving nearly 30 artists of the day (prompted by the Prince of Wales) to promote good design on tableware. The &#x27;Artists in Industry&#x27; earthenware examples were produced under her direction, and the artists included such notable names as Duncan Grant, Paul Nash, Barbara Hepworth, Vanessa Bell, and Dame Laura Knight. The project &#x27;Modern Art for the Table&#x27; was launched at Harrods London in October 1934 but received a mixed response from both the public and the press, though at the same time Cliff&#x27;s own patterns and shapes were selling in large quantities around the world.
Cliff&#x27;s patterns are highly stylised and interpreted in strong colors, such as the 1933 &quot;Honolulu&quot; pattern. The trees are enameled in red (coral) orange and yellow. Cliff produced a colourway variation on this by simply changing the trees to shades of blue and pink, and this was then called &quot;Rudyard&quot; after a local Staffordshire beauty spot.

Clarice Cliff&#x27;s fame and success in the 1930s are hard to fully appreciate now, but at that time there was no such thing as &#x27;career women&#x27;. The publicity she received in the national press was unprecedented. Research by a PhD student into the contemporary press between 1928 and 1936 found &quot;360 articles about Cliff and her work were published in the trade press, women&#x27;s magazines, national and local newspapers.&quot; This was put into context when he pointed out that in the same period, Susie Cooper, another Staffordshire ceramicist and designer, had &quot;fewer than 20 reviews, all bar one in the trade press&quot;.
Despite all the publicity she received, Cliff was camera shy, and in most cases the images of her pottery were what dominated the women&#x27;s magazine of the day. One picture which shows Cliff informally was taken when a South African stockist of her ware, from Werner Brothers, visited the factory on a buying trip. Cliff is seen with the 3-year-old daughter and wife of the stockist. After the visit Cliff sent the daughter a present of a child&#x27;s miniature tea set painted in her &quot;Honolulu&quot; pattern.

In the mid 30s tastes changed and heavily modeled ware came into vogue. The &quot;My Garden&quot; series issued from 1934 onwards led the way, with small flowers modelled as a handle or base on more rounded shapes. These were fully painted in bright colours – the body of the ware was covered in thin colour washes – &#x27;Verdant&#x27; was green, &#x27;Sunrise&#x27; yellow and so on. The range included vases, bowls, jugs, a biscuit barrel, and proved very popular as gift ware. It was produced in more muted colours, right until the start of the war in 1939.
Other shapes included the 1937 &#x27;Raffia&#x27; based on traditional basketware by Native Americans, decorated in a similar style to them with small blocks of colour. More popular was the heavily modeled &quot;Harvest&quot; ware, jugs and bowls modelled with corn and fruit. After the war this range was heavily marketed in North America (very patriotically) as &quot;England&quot;. This later ware attracts relatively low prices at auction.

==The 1940s==
In 1940, after the death of Ann Shorter, Colley&#x27;s wife, he married Cliff and she moved into his home at Chetwynd House on Northwood Lane in Clayton, Staffordshire. This Arts and Crafts home had been designed in 1899 and was one of the earliest commissions of the British architects Parker and Unwin (Richard Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin) who were later heavily involved in the Welwyn Garden City project.

During World War II only plain white pottery (utility ware) was permitted under wartime regulations, so Cliff assisted with management of the pottery but was not able to continue design work. Instead she concentrated her creative talents on gardening and the massive garden at Chetwynd House became her shared passion with Shorter.

After the war, although Cliff was occasionally nostalgic for the &#x27;Bizarre&#x27; years, as witnessed in personal letters to friends, she seemed to be realistic and accepted the commercial taste was for conservative ware. Clarice seemed to enjoy playing a lesser role at the factory, knowing that she could not recapture those crazy days of the thirties. Much of the postwar production went to Australia, New Zealand or North America, where the taste was for formal ware in traditional English designs such as &quot;Tonquin&quot; rather than the striking patterns and shapes that had established Cliff&#x27;s reputation; thus she was never to return to creative work. The postwar ware has little value at auction.

==Later life==
A. J. Wilkinson and their Newport Pottery continued to sell ware under Cliff&#x27;s name until 1964. The death of Colley Shorter in 1963 led Cliff to sell the factory to Midwinter in 1964 and she retired, becoming somewhat of a recluse. However, from December 1971 to January 1972, the first exhibition of Clarice Cliff pottery took place at Brighton, East Sussex. Cliff reluctantly provided comments for the catalogue, though she declined to attend the opening.

The exhibition was prompted by enthusiastic collectors, including Martin Battersby, an early devotee of 20s and 30s design, the first author on that period to publish major works, and a devotee of Cliff&#x27;s ceramics. Then, on 23 October 1972, Cliff died suddenly at Chetwynd House.

==Revival of interest in her work==
The exhibition and the first book published privately in 1976 &#x27;Clarice Cliff&#x27; by Peter Wentworth- and Kay Johnson (L&#x27;Odeon publishing) marked the start of a major revival of interest in Cliff&#x27;s work, which has continued to be sought after by Art Deco ceramic collectors ever since.
In 1982 the original &quot;Clarice Cliff Collectors Club&quot; was formed and promoted her and her work throughout the world. The club founder had appealed in the &quot;Staffordshire Evening Sentinel&quot; for anyone who worked with Cliff to contact him and was delighted when he found 28 former workers. Still calling themselves the &#x27;Bizarre girls&#x27; even in their mid-1970s and early 1980s Cliff&#x27;s former painters were delighted in the interest in the pottery they had hand painted 50 years earlier. They attended the annual meetings of the club, and were to be involved in many television and radio programs about Cliff, and a mass of books that appeared. Many of their memories were recorded in the &quot;CCCC Reviews&quot; from 1982 to 2004. The club also held meetings and exhibitions in Britain, North America, Australia and New Zealand.
The Stoke-on-Trent meetings visited the old painting shop of Bizarre ware by the canal at Newport, Burslem, from 1987 to 1997. It was demolished by Wedgwood in 1997, and the land sold for housing.

In 1985, a series of pieces were produced under the title The Bizarre Collection, with the mark for the &quot;Royal Staffordshire Pottery by Clarice Cliff&quot;, and marketed by the Midwinter pottery.

The three principal designs produced were &quot;Honolulu&quot; on a 12-inch Mei Ping vase, &quot;Summerhouse&quot; on a 13-inch wall plate and a striking version of &quot;Umbrellas and Rain&quot; on a conical bowl. These pieces can be identified with a tiny impressed &quot;85&quot; for the year of manufacture. There was also a selection of six conical sugar sifters, again hand-painted, with the exception of the aforementioned &quot;Crocus&quot; which was lithographed.

A chain of mergers finally led to Wedgwood owning the Clarice Cliff name, and from 1992 to 2002 they too produced a range of reproductions of the highly sought 1930s pieces.

The first pieces produced included a ginger jar in &quot;House and Bridge&quot;, a large shape 14 vase in &quot;Solitude&quot;, a Stamford shape teapot milk and sugar in &quot;Pink Roof Cottage&quot;, a Conical bowl in &quot;Tennis&quot;, and a wall plaque in &quot;Lightning&quot;; there was also a Latona large shape 14 vase that was exclusively available to members of the CCCC.

These reproductions should not be confused with forgeries (of which a number are found), the Wedgwood ones are clearly marked as &#x27;Wedgwood Clarice Cliff&#x27;. An original Cliff painter Alice Andrews, then in her 80s, was employed to appear at launches of the ware in stores throughout Britain.

==Status as an artist==
In the mid-1990s Cliff&#x27;s position as a major artist of her era was confirmed when she was included in major international reference works: the &quot;Dictionary of Art&quot; by Macmillan Publishers, and &quot;Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon&quot; by K. G. Saur Verlag.

The work of the CCCC culminated with the centenary exhibition &quot;Clarice Cliff, the Art of Bizarre&quot; at the Wedgwood Museum, Barlaston, Stoke-on-Trent. Nowadays, with 26 years of experience the club is based online (see below). It should not be confused with an organisation who used the same name from 2001 after registering it in 1997.

The CCCC was then the consultant for the BBC Radio 4 drama &quot;The Bizarre Girl&quot;, written by Lizzie Slater which was described as &quot;an uplifting drama exploring the dramatic rise of Clarice Cliff from the shop floor to Company Art Director – illustrating how a working-class Staffordshire girl brought modern art to the people.&quot; The drama was broadcast in December 2000.

A film of her life, titled &quot;The Colour Room&quot; and directed by Claire McCarthy, was released on 12 November 2021. Cliff is played by Phoebe Dynevor.

In April 2024, a blue plaque was placed at the flat where Cliff lived in 20 Snow Hill, Shelton, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. The blue plaque scheme is run by Historic England to mark the lives of inspirational people.

==Collecting Clarice==
In 2002, Peter Wentworth- and Kay Johnson, the authors of the original &#x27;Clarice Cliff&#x27; book from 1976, returned to Britain to lecture at a CCCC event at Christie&#x27;s, South Kensington. They spoke about the early days of collecting when their first purchase had been &quot;a Summerhouse Athens jug for 7 shillings and 6 pence, 35 pence&quot;.

Rare combinations of shape and pattern attract high prices at auction. The world record price for a piece of Clarice Cliff is held by Christie&#x27;s, South Kensington, London, who sold an &#x27;charger&#x27; (wall plaque) in the &quot;May Avenue&quot; pattern for £39,500 in 2004. Shortly after this the same auction house sold an vase in &quot;Sunspots&quot; for £20,000.

A rare &quot;Red Autumn&quot; shape 369 vase sold for £4,900 at Fielding&#x27;s auctioneers, Stourbridge in the West Midlands, and Woolley and Wallis auctioneers Salisbury sold a high miniature vase in &quot;Café&quot; (used as a salesman&#x27;s sample in the 1930s) for a staggering £3000. In May 2009 an eighteen-inch charger in the &quot;May Avenue&quot; pattern sold for £20,500 at Fielding&#x27;s auctioneers.

In 2009, Will Farmer of the BBC &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; and members of the Clarice Cliff Collectors Club unveiled three plaques. These were on her birthplace, Meir Street, Tunstall, her second home on Edwards Street, Tunstall and the site of Newport Pottery by the canal in Burslem where her Bizarre ware was decorated. These were featured in special &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; programme that December.

In September 2009, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London opened its &#x27;New Ceramics Galleries&#x27; and Cliff&#x27;s work was chosen to be included: &quot;There will be two rooms displaying 20th-century collections. One will show ceramics made in a factory context and will include objects by designers such as Susie Cooper and Clarice Cliff&quot;.

<doc id="375665" wikidata="Q1156923" url="?curid=375665" title="Google (verb)">
<text>Owing to the dominance of the Google search engine, to google has become a transitive verb. The neologism commonly refers to searching for information on the World Wide Web, typically using the Google search engine. The American Dialect Society chose it as the &quot;most useful word of 2002&quot;. It was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; on June 15, 2006, and to the eleventh edition of the &quot;Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary&quot; in July 2006.

==Etymology==
The first recorded usage of &quot;google&quot; was as a gerund, on July 8, 1998, by Google co-founder Larry Page himself, who wrote on a mailing list: &quot;Have fun and keep googling!&quot;. Its earliest known use as an explicitly transitive verb on American television was in the &quot;Help&quot; episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (October 15, 2002), when Willow asked Buffy, &quot;Have you googled her yet?&quot;.

To prevent genericizing and potential loss of its trademark, Google has discouraged use of the word as a verb, particularly when used as a synonym for general web searching. On February 23, 2003, Google sent a cease and desist letter to Paul McFedries, creator of Word Spy, a website that tracks neologisms. In an article in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Frank Ahrens discussed the letter he received from a Google lawyer that demonstrated &quot;appropriate&quot; and &quot;inappropriate&quot; ways to use the verb &quot;google&quot;.

It was reported that, in response to this concern, lexicographers for the &quot;Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary&quot; turned to lowercase the actual entry of the word, &quot;google.&quot; And, they maintained the capitalization of the search engine in their definition, &quot;to use the Google search engine to seek online information&quot; (a concern which did not deter the Oxford editors from preserving the history of both &quot;cases&quot;). On October 25, 2006, Google sent a request to the public requesting that &quot;You should please only use &#x27;Google&#x27; when you&#x27;re actually referring to Google Inc. and our services.&quot;

 means it is something that cannot be &quot;googled&quot;i.e. it cannot be easily found using a web search engine, especially Google. If a word or phrase is &quot;ungoogleable&quot;, it means it cannot be googled. In 2013, the Swedish Language Council attempted to include the Swedish version of the word () in its list of new words, but Google objected to the definition not being specifically related to Google, and the council was forced to remove it immediately to avoid a legal confrontation with Google.

<text>Westlife are an Irish pop group formed in Dublin in 1998. The group consists of members Shane Filan, Mark Feehily, Kian Egan, and Nicky Byrne. Brian McFadden was a member before leaving in March 2004. The group disbanded in 2012 and later reunited in 2018. 

In Ireland, the group has 11 number-one albums, 16 number-one singles, and 34 Top 50 singles. They have sold over 55 million records and are holders of four &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Westlife has received numerous accolades including one World Music Award, two Brit Awards, four MTV Awards, and four Record of the Year Awards.

The group has released twelve studio albums: four as a five-piece and eight as a four-piece. They rose to fame with their debut international self-titled studio album, &quot;Westlife&quot; (1999). It was followed by &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; (2000), &quot;World of Our Own&quot; (2001), and &quot;Turnaround&quot; (2003). Following the departure of McFadden, the group released the cover albums &quot;...Allow Us to Be Frank&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Love Album&quot; (2006), the albums &quot;Face to Face&quot; (2005), &quot;Back Home&quot; (2007), &quot;Where We Are&quot; (2009), and &quot;Gravity&quot; (2010), followed by an eight-year split. After reforming in 2018, the quartet released the studio albums &quot;Spectrum&quot; (2019) and &quot;Wild Dreams&quot; (2021).

==History==

=== Formation and early years (1997–1998) ===
Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, and Shane Filan, all schoolmates at Summerhill College in Sligo, Ireland, participated in a school production of &quot;Grease&quot; with fellow Sligo men Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael Garrett. The sextet formed a pop vocal group called Six as One in 1997, later renamed IOYOU. The group, managed by choreographer Mary McDonagh and two other informal managers, released a single titled &quot;Together Girl Forever&quot; under Sound Records. McDonagh first encountered Egan as a six-year-old student at her weekly dance classes and came to know Filan and Feehily in their early teens as they starred in shows such as &quot;Oliver!&quot; and &quot;Godspell&quot; for Sligo Fun Company.
Louis Walsh, the manager of fellow Irish boy band Boyzone, came to know the group after Filan&#x27;s mother Mae contacted him, but the group failed to secure a BMG record deal with Simon Cowell. Cowell told Walsh: &quot;You are going to have to fire at least three of them. They have great voices, but they are the ugliest band I have ever seen in my life.&quot; Lacey, Keighron, and Garrett were told they would not be part of the new group, and auditions were held in Dublin where Nicky Byrne and Brian McFadden were recruited.

The new group, formed on 3 July 1998, was originally named Westside but renamed themselves as Westlife due to an existing band with that name. They signed a four-million-pound record deal with RCA Records. Westlife&#x27;s first big break came in 1998 when they opened for Boyzone and Backstreet Boys&#x27; concerts in Dublin. Boyzone singer Ronan Keating was brought in to co-manage the group with Louis Walsh. Their first live television performance as a group was on the Irish TV series &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; broadcast on 13 November 1998. They performed &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot;.

===&quot;Westlife&quot;, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, and &quot;World of Our Own&quot; (1999–2001)===
In April 1999, the group released their first single, “Swear It Again&quot;, which immediately topped the charts in Ireland and in the UK for two weeks. It was the biggest-selling single in the first week by a debut artist. Their second single, &quot;If I Let You Go&quot; was released in August 1999, which made them the first boy band to hit No. 1 with their first two singles. Their third single was &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; (their first &#x27;Record of the Year&#x27; and their third No. 1 single), released in October of the same year. &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; was also included on the soundtrack of the Warner Brothers film, &quot;Pokémon: The Movie 2000&quot;. Their first album, simply titled &quot;Westlife&quot;, was released in November 1999 and went to No. 2 in the UK and No. 1 in Ireland. The album was the biggest chart dropper on the Top 40 in UK music history when in its 58th week on the charts it leaped from No. 79 to No. 3 before falling to No. 37 the following week. In Scotland, the album debuted at number 6 in 1999 but subsequently peaked at number one year later in 2001.

In December 1999, a fourth single was released, the double A-side &quot;I Have A Dream&quot;/&quot;Seasons in the Sun&quot;. It was the 1999 UK Christmas number-one single and their fourth No. 1 single. They are one of only five acts to achieve four number ones in the UK Singles Chart in one calendar year. The fifth and final single from the album, &quot;Fool Again&quot;, also peaked at No. 1. They became the only male band to have every single release from an album that reached No. 1 in the UK. Afterward, Westlife signed to Arista Records for the North American release of their debut. &quot;Swear It Again&quot; peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. On 1 July 2000, they were honored as Freemen of the Borough of Sligo. An honor given to people who have promoted the town and county of Sligo, Ireland.

&quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, their second album, was released a year later and was their first No. 1 UK album, beating the Spice Girls&#x27; &quot;Forever&quot; album by a large margin; the chart battle was widely reported by British media. It became the country&#x27;s 4th biggest-selling album of 2000. This is their second No. 1 album in Ireland. The album was preceded by the duet with Mariah Carey &quot;Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)&quot; and the original song &quot;My Love&quot; (their second Record of the Year award). Both singles reached No. 1 on the UK charts, their sixth and seventh number ones respectively. With this, Westlife broke the record of the most consecutive No. 1 singles in the UK with their first seven singles. However, in December 2000, their eighth single &quot;What Makes a Man&quot;, debuted at No. 2, breaking their string of consecutive number ones. The single &quot;My Love&quot; was controversially used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as part of a torture program in Afghanistan. According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), &quot;the music pounded constantly as part of a scheme to assault prisoners&#x27; senses&quot;.

Outside the UK and Ireland, they gained chart success with &quot;I Lay My Love on You&quot; and &quot;When You&#x27;re Looking Like That&quot;. They were included in the top ten earners list of all acts in the UK and Ireland and sold over 2.5 million units in the Asia Pacific region. In February 2001, they began their first world tour, &quot;Where Dreams Come True Tour&quot;. A recording of a concert from the tour live from Dublin was released on 19 November 2001. 

On 12 November 2001, Westlife released their third album, &quot;World of Our Own&quot;, peaking at No. 1 in the UK and Ireland. &quot;Uptown Girl&quot; (their first single to be on the List of million-selling singles in the United Kingdom), &quot;Queen of My Heart&quot; and &quot;World of Our Own&quot; were released as singles, all of which peaked at No. 1 in the UK. &quot;Bop Bop Baby&quot; was also released as a single and peaked at No. 5 in the UK. In 2002, Westlife went on their second world tour, the World of Our Own Tour. By the end of the year, IRMA awarded the band for 1 million units sold in Ireland. The group sold more than 12 million records in a span of three years.

===&quot;Unbreakable&quot;, &quot;Turnaround&quot;, and McFadden&#x27;s departure (2002–2004)===

Westlife released their eleventh UK No. 1 single, &quot;Unbreakable&quot; in 2002. Amidst rumors of a split, Westlife released their first greatest hits album in November of that same year titled &quot;Unbreakable - The Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot;, which peaked at No. 1 in the UK and Ireland. During this time, Westlife achieved a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for most public appearances by a pop group in 36 hours. The band made stop-offs in five different cities (Dublin, Belfast, Edinburgh, London, and Manchester) to promote their then-new album. The release was followed by the double A-side single &quot;Tonight&quot;/&quot;Miss You Nights&quot;, which debuted at No. 3 in the UK and No. 1 in Ireland. Following this release, the group premiered a TV documentary titled &quot;Wild Westlife&quot;. Iain MacDonald directed it and features their daily life as musicians and their tour experiences. It was aired on BBC Choice. In 2003, Westlife went on their third world tour, the Unbreakable Tour. A recording of a concert from the tour in Manchester was released in November 2003.

In September 2003, Westlife released &quot;Hey Whatever&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 in the UK. Their fourth studio album, &quot;Turnaround&quot;, was released in November 2003, earning the group another No. 1 album in the UK and Ireland. &quot;Mandy&quot;, was released a week before the album and became the band&#x27;s twelfth No. 1 single. It also won them their third Record of the Year award. &quot;Mandy&quot; is the single with the longest leap to the top (from No. 200 to No. 1) in UK music history. &quot;Obvious&quot; was released as the final single from the album, charting at No. 3.

On 9 March 2004, just three weeks before embarking on their fourth world tour, McFadden left the group, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. McFadden&#x27;s final public performance as part of Westlife was at Newcastle upon Tyne&#x27;s Powerhouse nightclub on 27 February 2004. He subsequently began a solo career, and reverted the spelling of his first name back to its original &#x27;Brian&#x27;.

Less than a month after McFadden&#x27;s departure, the group began their Turnaround Tour. A recording of a concert from the Turnaround Tour, live from Stockholm, Sweden, was released in November 2004.

===&quot;Face to Face&quot;, &quot;Back Home&quot;, and cover albums (2004–2008)===
In September 2004, they performed at the World Music Awards, where they were recognized as the Best Irish Act of that year. They then released a Rat Pack-inspired album, their fifth album &quot;...Allow Us to Be Frank&quot;, which peaked at number 3. No singles from this album were released in the UK, but the track &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Kick in the Head?&quot; had a music video produced and was released as a physical single in other European countries. &quot;Smile&quot; and &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; also had music videos produced. Prior to the release of the &quot;...Allow Us to Be Frank&quot; album, Westlife scouted for &quot;the perfect fan&quot; to help promote the album. After &quot;X Factor&quot;-style auditions, they found Joanne Hindley, who recorded &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; with the group. A television program documenting this process, &quot;She&#x27;s The One&quot;, was presented by Kate Thornton. Westlife embarked on &quot;The Number Ones Tour&quot; in early 2005. A recording of a concert from the tour, live from Sheffield, was released in November 2005.

In October 2005, Westlife released the single &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;, which became their thirteenth number 1 single. It was taken from their sixth album &quot;Face to Face&quot; which also peaked at No. 1 in the UK. &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; was awarded as their fourth Record of the Year in the UK. In December of that year, the group released &quot;When You Tell Me That You Love Me&quot;, a duet with Diana Ross, as the second single. It debuted and peaked at No. 2. The third single from the album, &quot;Amazing&quot;, peaked at No. 4. Westlife embarked on the &quot;Face to Face Tour&quot;, traveling extensively to the UK, Ireland, Australia, and Asia. The group performed 32 shows and recorded 238,718 attendances. A recording of a concert from the tour, live from Wembley Arena, was released in November 2006.

In late 2006, Westlife signed a new five-album deal with Sony BMG Music Entertainment. Their seventh album, &quot;The Love Album&quot; was a concept album that consisted of popular love song covers. The album debuted at No. 1 in both the UK and Ireland. It was the top-selling album of 2006 in Ireland. The only single from &quot;The Love Album&quot;, &quot;The Rose&quot;, became their 14th UK No. 1 single. Westlife kicked off their eighth world tour, &quot;The Love Tour&quot;, in Perth, Australia. The group then went on to other Australian cities before moving on to South Africa, the UK, and Ireland. The tour grossed £1,031,033. 

On 5 November 2007, Westlife released their eighth album, &quot;Back Home&quot;, which contained nine new original songs and three cover songs. The album debuted at No. 1 in the UK and Ireland. It was also 2007&#x27;s fifth biggest-selling album in the UK. The first single released from the album was &quot;Home&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 in the UK. &quot;Us Against the World&quot; was released as the second single and &quot;Something Right&quot; became the third single in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. On 15 December 2007, they premiered a two-hour show called &quot;The Westlife Show&quot; where they performed 10 of their songs, hosted by Holly Willoughby. They embarked on the Back Home Tour on 25 February 2008. This tour marked the first time that the group had traveled and performed in New Zealand, performing four sold-out shows in Auckland, Wellington, New Plymouth, and Christchurch. Westlife were the seventh top touring act of 2008.

=== 10th anniversary, &quot;Where We Are,&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot; (2008–2010) ===
To mark their tenth year in music, Westlife staged the sold-out concert &quot;10 Years of Westlife&quot; in Croke Park on 1 June 2008. The group announced that they would be going on hiatus for a year after their Back Home Tour.&quot;10 Years of Westlife – Live at Croke Park Stadium&quot; was released on 24 November 2008 and went straight to No. 1 on the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Hong Kong, and New Zealand Music DVD charts. On 13 December 2008, while on hiatus, Westlife made an unexpected appearance during that year&#x27;s &quot;X Factor&quot; final where they performed &quot;Flying Without Wings&quot; with runners-up JLS. In the last week of January 2009, a DVD titled &quot;The Karaoke Collection&quot; was released. On 18 March 2009, Westlife won the Best Irish Pop Act at the 2009 Meteor Awards for the ninth consecutive time.

Their tenth album, &quot;Where We Are&quot;, was released on 30 November 2009 in the UK and peaked at No. 2 on both Irish and UK Albums Charts. The lead single, &quot;What About Now&quot;, was released on 23 October 2009 and peaked at No. 2 on both Irish and UK Singles Charts.

They were part of the Haiti charity single in early 2010 with &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, which was organized by Cowell. The single peaked at No. 1 on both Irish and UK Singles Charts. That year, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; announced that Westlife was the top-selling album group of the 21st century, with 10.74 million albums sold in the UK alone. 

On 14 November 2010, the single &quot;Safe&quot; was released. It debuted on the UK Singles Chart on 21 November at No. 10. The album &quot;Gravity&quot; was released on 22 November 2010. It was entirely produced by John Shanks. The album went to No. 1 in Ireland and No. 3 in the UK. This is their ninth No. 1 in Ireland; this album made Westlife one of the few musical acts to have number-one albums in three consecutive decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s) in their home country.

===&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and split (2011–2012)===
In March 2011, they began their eleventh major concert tour, the Gravity Tour. This tour marked the first time the group traveled to Oman, Namibia, Guangzhou, and Vietnam for concerts. As of 2011, the group was the longest-reigning band and second-longest-reigning number-one music act in the 21st century in the UK. On 14 March 2011, Westlife confirmed that they had left Cowell after 13 years and his record label Syco Music after nine years. Byrne said of Cowell: &quot;he got so busy [...] and we needed someone who was on it all the time.&quot;

After going back to RCA Records full-time for a one-year album contract, they announced their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album would be released on 21 November 2011. It debuted at No. 1 in Ireland and No. 4 in the UK. The first single, &quot;Lighthouse&quot;, was released in November 2011. A follow-up promotional single, &quot;Beautiful World&quot; was released the same month. The Greatest Hits Tour was announced on 18 October 2011, with dates in the UK confirmed for May 2012. &quot;Stereoboard&quot; reported that the tour sold out within minutes. The farewell tour consisted of eight dates in China and 33 in the UK and Ireland; in total, the band sold 489,694 tickets from the tour. On 19 October 2011, Westlife officially announced they were splitting following the tour.

ITV commissioned a one-off music event titled &quot;Westlife: For the Last Time&quot;. Another show, &quot;The Westlife Show: Live&quot;, was broadcast on 1 November 2011. Following this, they were guests on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. They were honored at that time by the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC) with four specially commissioned bar stools to mark 49 performances at the venue for over 380,000 fans, selling more tickets than any other act. The band had their final concert on 23 June 2012 at Croke Park Stadium in Ireland. The 82,300-capacity show was sold out in 4 minutes. Due to this popular demand, an extra date was added at Croke Park on 22 June 2012, which also sold out. Combined, there was a total of 187,808 spectators on both nights, exceeding the stadium&#x27;s capacity. Their last concert was screened live in more than 300 cinemas in the United Kingdom, and 200 cinemas worldwide. They released a DVD of the show, which went to number 1 in both UK and Irish charts. That year they were the 34th top-grossing tour act with earnings of $35.2 million (€27 million). Following the split, all four members released albums and singles individually.

<doc id="375668" wikidata="Q812945" url="?curid=375668" title="Beaminster">
<text>Beaminster ( ) is a town and civil parish in Dorset, England, approximately northwest of the county town Dorchester. It is sited in a bowl-shaped valley near the source of the small River Brit. The population of Beaminster parish was recorded as 3,177 in the 2021 census.

Beaminster is the product of the Anglo-Saxon age, dating back to around the 7th century, when it was known as Bebingmynster, meaning the church of Bebbe although the date of origin of the town is unknown. The place name and historic evidence indicates that it was probably the site of a primary Saxon minster church and was at the centre of a large episcopal estate. These are likely to have acted as a focus for a settlement, but evidence of its formation is lacking.

In its history Beaminster has been a centre of manufacture of linen and woollens, the raw materials for which were produced in the surrounding countryside. The town experienced three serious fires in the 17th and 18th centuries; the first of these, during the English Civil War, almost destroyed the fabric of the town.

Beaminster&#x27;s parish church – the Church of St Mary – is notable for its architecture, particularly its tower, and is grade I listed.

==History==
In the Domesday Book of 1086 the manor of Beaminster was recorded as being owned by the See of Salisbury. Bishop Osmund gave it as a supplement to two of the Cathedral prebends in 1091. The parish formed part of Beaminster Forum and Redhone hundred.
In the English Civil War the town declared for Parliament and was sacked by Royalist forces in 1644. Prince Maurice stayed in the town on Palm Sunday, though his stay was brief because a fire, caused by a musket being discharged into a thatched roof, almost totally destroyed the town. The town suffered further accidental fires in 1684 and 1781.

Previously Beaminster was a centre for the production of linen and woollens. Flax was grown and sheep kept on the surrounding hills and the town was locally more important than it is today: factories were constructed in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and as many as seventeen inns existed in the town in the early 20th century.

No railway line came through Beaminster and as a result the town declined relative to other local towns such as Bridport and Dorchester.

Horn Park, about northwest of Beaminster, is a neo-Georgian country house of five bays and two storeys, designed by architect T. Lawrence Dale and completed in 1911. Inside the house the central corridor is barrel vaulted and leads to a drawing room whose groin vault is reminiscent of the work of Sir John Soane (1753–1837). The drawing room includes Jacobean features re-used from the largely mid-16th-century nearby Parnham House, which was being altered and restored at about the time that Horn Park was being built. Horn Park is grade II listed. Its gardens are occasionally open to the public as part of the National Gardens Scheme.

==Geography==

Beaminster is sited above sea level in a bowl-shaped valley, surrounded by hills which rise to at Beaminster Down to the northeast. The River Brit and many small streams emerge from springs on the slopes above the town. The confluences of several of these streams are within the town&#x27;s boundaries. Beaminster&#x27;s growth has historically been along the course of these streams, resulting in a settlement pattern that is roughly star-shaped.

Beaminster is situated approximately south of Bristol, west of Bournemouth, east of Exeter and northwest of the county town Dorchester.

===Geology===
Beaminster is sited mostly on Middle Jurassic fuller&#x27;s earth clay, with some Inferior Oolite in the south of the town and Bridport Sand Formation north of the town centre. The hills north and east of the town are Cretaceous chalk with a scarp face of Upper Greensand Formation, while those to the south and west are of Bridport Sand Formation. There are several faults running west-northwest to east-southeast through the town and its southern environs. Horn Park Quarry SSSI produced building stone from the Inferior Oolite and some quality fossil specimens before becoming a light industrial estate on the road to Broadwindsor. Apart from the ammonites, the site displays a remarkable flat erosion surface and the most complete succession in the Upper Aalenian ironshot oolite limestone of the area.

Beaminster hosts the Beaminster Festival, an annual music and art festival. Whitcombe Disc golf course at Beaminster has hosted the British Open Disc Golf Championship several times and the European Disc Golf Championship in 2003. The town is twinned with the town of Saint-James on the Brittany/Normandy border in France.

Buckham Fair, a fundraising vintage fair held annually on land near the town, took place for ten years until the last event in 2018. As of 2020, the fair has been indefinitely postponed.

The main road through the town is the A3066, which leads to Bridport to the south and Mosterton and Crewkerne to the north. The road north passes through Horn Hill tunnel, which opened in June 1832 and is the sole pre-railway age road tunnel that is still in daily public use.

==Media==

Historically, Beaminster was a chapelry within the ancient parish of Netherbury. Beaminster was treated as a separate civil parish from an early date, but remained part of the ecclesiastical parish of Netherbury until 1849. When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894, Beaminster was given a parish council and included in the Beaminster Rural District. The rural district was abolished in 1974 to become part of the larger West Dorset district, which was in turn abolished in 2019 when the unitary Dorset Council was established.

==Education==
Primary schools in the town include St Mary&#x27;s Church of England Primary School.

Beaminster School is the town&#x27;s secondary school. It has a combined sixth form with The Sir John Colfox Academy, in the nearby town of Bridport.

Beaminster is also home to Mountjoy School co-sharing the site of Beaminster School.

Hooke Park is the woodland campus of the Architectural Association School of Architecture.

==Religion==

Beaminster has an Anglican church, dedicated to St Mary of the Annunciation; and a Catholic church, St John&#x27;s. St Mary&#x27;s is notable for its architecture, which is considered among the best in the county. The tower in particular has been described as &quot;a handsome example of its period&quot; and &quot;the glory of Beaminster&quot;. 

St Mary&#x27;s construction mostly dates from the 15th and 16th centuries, but was restored twice in the 19th. The eastern part of the north aisle incorporates part of an earlier 13th-century building, and the font bowl is late 12th century. The pulpit is Jacobean. A chapel of ease, Holy Trinity Church, was built in 1849-51. After becoming redundant in 1978, it was converted into a private residence, Trefoil House.

==In literature==
Beaminster is referenced as &quot;Emminster&quot; in the fictional Wessex of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;.

Dorset&#x27;s 19th-century dialect poet William Barnes wrote of Beaminster:
&lt;poem&gt;
Sweet Be&#x27;mi&#x27;ster, that bist a-bound
By green and woody hills all round,
Wi&#x27; hedges, reachèn up between
A thousand vields o&#x27; zummer green.
&lt;/poem&gt;

It is a location for part of the story for the post-apocalyptic novel &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; by John Wyndham.

<doc id="375669" wikidata="Q3363884" url="?curid=375669" title="Piedmont Park">
<text>Piedmont Park is an urban park in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, located about northeast of Downtown, between the Midtown and Virginia Highland neighborhoods. Originally the land was owned by Dr. Benjamin Walker, who used it as his out-of-town gentleman&#x27;s farm and residence. He sold the land in 1887 to the Gentlemen&#x27;s Driving Club (later renamed the Piedmont Driving Club), who wanted to establish an exclusive club and racing ground for horse enthusiasts. The Driving Club entered an agreement with the Piedmont Exposition Company, headed by prominent Atlantan Charles A. Collier, to use the land for fairs and expositions and later gave the park its name.

The park was originally designed by Joseph Forsyth Johnson to host the first of two major expositions held in the park in the late 19th century. The Piedmont Exposition opened in October 1887 to great fanfare. The event was a success and set the stage for the Cotton States and International Exposition which was held in the park seven years later in 1895. Both exhibitions showcased the prosperity of the region that had occurred during and after the Reconstruction period. In the early 20th century, a redesign plan called the Olmsted plan, was begun by the sons of New York Central Park architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. The effort led to the addition of scenic paths in the park and the joining of the park with the Ansley park system.

Over the years, the park has also served as an athletic center for the city. Atlanta&#x27;s first professional baseball team, the Atlanta Crackers, played in the park from 1902 to 1904. Several important intercollegiate rivalries were also forged in the park including the University of Georgia vs. Georgia Tech baseball rivalry and Georgia versus Auburn football which has been called the &quot;Deep South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry&quot;.

Throughout the 20th century, many improvements have been made in the park, including the addition of covered picnic areas, tennis facilities, the Lake Clara Meer dock and visitors center, and two playgrounds. In 2008, a ground-breaking ceremony was held for a extension to the park. On April 12, 2011, Mayor Kasim Reed cut the ribbon to open the first phase of a major expansion into the northern third of the park. Additional areas at the far north of the park (near Ansley Mall) are to be developed next.

==History==
===Opening===

Atlanta was a rapidly growing city in the years before Piedmont Park. From 1860 to 1890, the population jumped from 9,554 to 65,533 residents. Those years saw the opening of many education institutions such as Morehouse College (1867), Clark College (1869), Spelman College (1881), Morris Brown College (1882), Georgia School of Technology (now known as the Georgia Institute of Technology) (1885), and Agnes Scott College (1890). John B. Gordon, a distinguished Confederate general, was Governor of Georgia.

The area soon to be known as Piedmont Park was owned by Benjamin Walker, who purchased the in the 1830s from a man who had won the land in the land lottery. Walker farmed the land until, in 1887, he sold the land to the Gentlemen&#x27;s Driving Club, known today as the Piedmont Driving Club, who planned &quot;to form exclusive club and racing ground for horse enthusiasts&quot;. The driving club entered into an agreement with the Piedmont Exposition Company to use the grounds around the track as exposition space. Charles A. Collier, a prominent Atlanta businessman and former lawyer, was president of the company. Soon after, a main building, grandstands, and club house were built for the track.

===The 1887 Piedmont Exposition===

The first exposition ever held in Piedmont Park, the Piedmont Exposition of 1887, opened on October 10. The main building constructed for the Exposition was long, wide, and two stories high. The first day opened with 20,000 visitors. Samuel J. Randall opened the Exposition with a speech on the success of the resurrected post-civil war south. When his speech concluded, General Pierce M. B. Young and his men fired cannons to signal the opening of the events.

Exhibitors showed off a variety of items including works of art, local raw materials like manganese, marble, and wood work. Many prominent figures of the day were in attendance to see the displays. Governor David B. Hill of New York spoke at the event as well as President Grover Cleveland who attended with his wife, Frances Folsom. Over 50,000 people were in attendance for Cleveland&#x27;s speech. When the exposition was over, civic leaders said that it had successfully expanded Atlanta&#x27;s reputation as a place to visit and to conduct business.

The Exposition was also a chance for Atlanta to prove that it was ready to host a world&#x27;s fair. The Executive Committee of the Fair was invited to attend the event under the bidding of Charles Reynolds, Secretary of the Piedmont Exposition Company.

===The &quot;Deep South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry&quot;===
Five years later, Piedmont Park was the location of the second football game and the beginning of the &quot;Deep South&#x27;s Oldest Rivalry&quot; between Auburn University (then named Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama) and the University of Georgia. The game was arranged by former Johns Hopkins classmates, Dr. Charles Herty of Georgia and Dr. George Petrie of Auburn. Auburn won the game 10–0. It was rumored afterward that Georgia&#x27;s mascot, a goat (it wasn&#x27;t until 1921 that Georgia officially became the Bulldogs), was the main course at a barbecue held by Georgia fans after the game.

===Cotton States and International Exposition (1895)===
In 1894, the Piedmont Exposition Company offered to sell the land to the city of Atlanta for $165,000.00, but Mayor John B. Goodwin refused. Thus, The park remained in private hands and outside the city limits for another ten years.

The Cotton States and International Exposition which opened for 100 days beginning on September 18, 1895 and ending December 31, 1895, attracted visitors from the U.S. and 13 countries. Over $2 million was spent on the transformation of Piedmont Park. The government allocated $250,000 for the construction of a government building and many states and countries such as Argentina also had their own buildings. Also constructed for the fair were the Tropical gardens, now known as the Atlanta Botanical Garden, and Lake Clara Meer which was originally a pond but was expanded to for the event. Today, the stone balustrades scattered around the park are the only part of the enormous main building. The park remains largely as Joseph Forsyth Johnson designed it for the exposition although some changes were made during the Olmsted planning phase. However, most of the buildings that were constructed for the exposition were made of local Georgia granite and the buildings were dismantled after the event so that the granite could be sold to absolve the debt that the city incurred to hold the fair.

Booker T. Washington delivered his famous Atlanta Exposition Speech at the Expo, which is &quot;widely regarded as one of the most significant speeches in American history.&quot; In his speech, Washington pushed for progress but not integration, a point that angered many other black leaders such as W. E. B. Du Bois.

Attractions included Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show, the Liberty Bell, and the first public demonstration of C. Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat&#x27;s motion picture projection device which they called the Phantoscope. John Philip Sousa&#x27;s &quot;King Cotton&quot; march was created for the expo and was performed at the ceremony, and was conducted by the composer himself.

After the Exposition, the park continued to be extremely popular and was a magnet for growth in the area. State fairs and holiday celebrations were held at the park. Street car lines to the park increased. It was a generally prosperous time.

===The beginnings of Atlanta baseball===
In March 1898, the baseball fields were finally completed. On April 16, 1898, the first baseball game between Georgia and Georgia Tech, then known as the Georgia School of Technology, was played. From 1902 until 1904, the Atlanta Crackers, the city&#x27;s original professional baseball team played ball on the fields of Piedmont Park before moving to a stadium on Ponce de Leon Avenue.

===The Olmsted plan===

The year 1904 for was a watershed time for the park. The preceding year, the prominent Atlantan George Washington Collier died. Collier had owned of land to the west and north of the park that was sold for $300,000 to developers. The city bought the park for $98,000 in 1904, incorporating Piedmont Park into Atlanta&#x27;s city limits. Mayor Evan Howell agreed to purchase the park, but only if it included those developed areas adjacent to the park which would add approximately $35,000 to $40,000 in tax revenues annually.

The main developer of Collier&#x27;s land was Edwin Ansley, who created the Ansley Park subdivision under the guidelines set by the Olmsteds. The result was curvy streets surrounding &quot;mini-parks&quot; comprising a total of . In 1912, these parks were deeded to the city.

In 1909, the sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, landscape architect for Central Park in New York, Carey and Frederick Jr. were asked to design the park&#x27;s master plan while they were at work on Grant Park. The city agreed to pay $1,800 for the plan, but Olmsted was concerned that Atlanta might not have enough money for the necessary improvements.

In 1910, the brothers submitted a plan for the park that was to include a scenic path and driveways that would link Piedmont Park to the streets of Ansley Park. Joining the parks was a success and thereafter, the parks were known as Twin Parks. Although never fully implemented, the Olmsted plan had a great effect on the development in the surrounding area.

===20th-century growth and development===

The park&#x27;s first bathhouse was opened in 1911. Swimming in the lake was allowed until 1973, when the city opened a pool in the park. The same year the first bathhouse was opened, the Peace Monument, a Confederate monument, was dedicated in the park, near the 14th Street gate.

On January 29, 1913, Calvin Shelverton applied for a building permit to construct the Piedmont Park Apartments. The apartments were designed by Leila Ross Wilburn and were decidedly middle-class unlike some of the other developments in the area. The apartments remained middle-class up until about 1960, and residents included such prominent Atlantans as accounting company president T. C. Dunlap and lawyer J. B. Stewart. In 1913, seven clay courts were built where the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition&#x27;s Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building once was. Eight more courts were added in 1914 to accommodate the overwhelming demand. That same year, the Sidney Lanier Monument was dedicated in the park.

Notable additions and buildings include the bandstand, built in 1915; a picnic shelter constructed by the WPA in 1936; the Steffen Thomas-designed &quot;Pioneer Women&quot; memorial in 1938; the Noguchi &quot;Playscapes&quot;, completed in 1976 under the aegis of the High Museum and a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and designed by world-renowned artist and sculptor Isamu Noguchi, noteworthy as the only public work by Noguchi in the U.S. In 2002, the dog park was opened.

&quot;Playscapes&quot; underwent restoration in 2005 under Eddie Granderson, public arts manager of the City of Atlanta. Jablonski Berkowitz Conservation Inc. was selected to do the restoration and assessments began in September of that year. The company was charged with bringing the playground up to safety codes and restoring the original paint.

===2008 drought===
In January 2008, city officials announced that the Peachtree Road Race, Atlanta Pride Festival, the Atlanta Jazz Festival, and the Dogwood Festival would not be held in the park due to extreme drought. Some festivals which don&#x27;t make use of green space were still allowed in the park. The Atlanta Arts Festival ran from September 12–14, 2008, and utilized only paved areas. Other festivals were temporarily moved to alternate venues, such as Centennial Olympic Park. The drought in Atlanta ended by late 2009. In 2010, several events returned to Piedmont Park, including the Dogwood Festival, the Jazz Festival, and Screen on the Green.

===2011 expansion===

Approximately in the northwest portion of the park had remained woodlands into the 21st century. In 2007, a park expansion plan called for a new parking deck as well as &quot;open green space, bicycle and walking trails, formal and community gardens, an interactive water feature, children&#x27;s playgrounds, a skate park, athletic fields, and woodlands&quot;. The project was expected to cost $72 million.

On April 23, 2008, a ground-breaking ceremony was held at the Bathhouse for the expansion of the Park. The pool and bathhouse are part of a huge Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) renovation that cost around $7.8 million and was completed in early summer 2009. The renovation features accessibility, a warming kitchen, WiFi, a pool with beach entry, bubblers, current channel, vortex, fountains, separate splash pad, lap lanes, landscaped deck environment, and concessions. A new area featuring a Bocce ball court and green space with an arbor opened in May 2010.

On April 12, 2011, Mayor Kasim Reed cut the ribbon to open the first phase of a major expansion into the northern third of the park. Areas opened include two oval-shaped plazas (&quot;The Greensward&quot; and &quot;The Promenade&quot;, which contains the interactive &quot;Legacy Fountain&quot;), the &quot;Lower Meadow&quot;, the &quot;Six Springs Wetlands&quot;, and a vastly expanded dog park.

===2013 expansion===

Construction began in early 2013 on areas at the far north of the park, including The Northwoods, Piedmont Commons, and Piedmont Gardens. New park entrances are to be added at the eastern end of Westminster Dr. (off Piedmont Ave.), the northern end of Dutch Valley Pl., and at 1514 Monroe just south of Piedmont Ave., on the site of Agnes &amp; Muriel&#x27;s restaurant. There are already dirt trails that follow Clear Creek and the BeltLine Eastside Trail northwards connecting the 2011 and 2013 expansion areas and providing pedestrian access to the Ansley Mall area north of the park, and to the BeltLine trails going further north.

==Piedmont Park Conservancy==
The Piedmont Park Conservancy is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization that is in charge of park improvements and 90 percent of the Park&#x27;s daily maintenance care and security. The Conservancy was founded in 1989 to revitalize the rapidly deteriorating park. Since then, it has raised and invested $66 million in the restoration and enhancement of Piedmont Park and making it, once again, the most visited green space in Atlanta.

The park hosts several miles of paved paths suitable for walking, running, biking, and inline skating. Skate Escape across from the park at the 12th Street entrance rents both bikes and skates. On weekend afternoons, skateboarders and inline skaters often share the open, paved area inside the 12th Street entrance.

Piedmont Park has picnic shelters located just to the East of the north soccer field. There are also various picnic tables and benches throughout the park. Many visitors choose to picnic on the expansive lawns as well. The first grill in Piedmont Park was erected for the 1895 Cotton States Exposition where the administrative offices now sit. There are 22 grills throughout the park. No portable grills are allowed.

The Noguchi &quot;Playscape&quot; is located near the 12th Street Gate. The geometrically shaped, modernist playground includes a soaring swing set, slide, sand pit, climbing dome and more made of bright and exciting colors.
Also in the park is a new playground known as Mayor&#x27;s Grove. It was designed as a Boundless Playgrounds and features a high level of accessibility and interactive play.

===Sports===
Piedmont Park is a popular place for organized sports. The Sharon E. Lester Tennis Center at Piedmont Park is a fully staffed, public facility with 12 lighted hard courts, offering leagues, lessons, and supplies.

The Active Oval has two softball fields, two soccer fields, and two beach volleyball courts, all ringed by a dirt running path. Kickball leagues also use the softball fields.

The park&#x27;s swimming center, once closed for renovations, re-opened in summer of 2009.

===Fishing and the lake===
The lake is located in the south east part of the park. Fishing is permitted in the lake, which is stocked with large mouth bass, crappie, bream, and catfish. A 2002 renovation of the lake added a new bridge connecting the two bodies of water and three fishing piers located around the lake.

Clara Meer Dock is located at the west corner of the lake. Just above the Dock sits the historic Visitor Center building. Clara Meer Dock forms an amphitheater-like space nestled into the western end of the lake. Clara Meer Dock is often used for wedding ceremonies. Rental of the dock also includes the Visitor Center. The Visitor Center features a barrel ceiling with a painted mural called &quot;A Day at the Park&quot; by Ralph Gilbert. The center seats 40 persons inside and over 200 more on the adjoining lawn and dock. The Dock seats up to 120 for ceremony, or up to 100 for table dining or possible dance floor area.

===Dogs===
With the exception of some festival weekends and special events, dogs are permitted in Piedmont Park, on leashes or shorter for safety reasons. Owners must clean up after their dogs, and the park has a half-dozen plastic bag dispensing stations to facilitate this. Several of the park&#x27;s water fountains also have a ground-level basin for dogs to use.

Just north of the Park Road entrance bridge are two fenced-in Dog Parks that equal to three acres where friendly dogs (and their owners) can cavort with each other off-leash. Brand new, vastly expanded parks for small and large dogs were opened in April 2011.

The Piedmont Park Conservancy (a nonprofit) was responsible for the restoration of the Piedmont Park Dog Parks, and still manages the dog parks today.

===Special events===

Piedmont Park is a central focal point of Atlanta&#x27;s Midtown community. The park is home to various annual celebrations and events, including Atlanta Pride Festival, the Atlanta Jazz Festival, the Atlanta Dogwood Festival, Music Midtown, Atlanta Black Pride, and Festival Peachtree Latino. A summer series of classic films, Screen on the Green, is also aired in the park for local residents. The Peachtree Road Race finishes at Piedmont Park.

On the weekend and holidays, the park comes alive with music, intramural sports, and fun festivities. In 2004, Georgia Shakespeare Festival added an annual series of free performances entitled &quot;Shake on the Lake&quot; with Lake Clara Meer as a backdrop. A centennial celebration was held for the park in June 2004. In 2007, the Allman Brothers Band and Dave Matthews Band played a concert with proceeds benefiting the planned expansion to the park. Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s performance was later released as a live DVD as well as their eighth live album, &quot;Live at Piedmont Park&quot;. Sir Paul McCartney performed in Piedmont Park to benefit the conservancy on August 15, 2009. The Eagles performed at the park on October 16, 2010, also as a benefit for the conservancy. In 2011, Music Midtown returned from its five-year hiatus, hosting headliners Coldplay and The Black Keys in Piedmont Park, however the 2022 concert was cancelled due to a lawsuit concerning firearms access. 

==Park schedule==
The park is open from 6:00 AM to 11:00 PM every day.

Linney made her Broadway debut in 1990 before receiving Tony Award nominations for the 2002 revival of &quot;The Crucible,&quot; the original Broadway productions of &quot;Sight Unseen&quot; (2004), &quot;Time Stands Still&quot; (2010), &quot;My Name Is Lucy Barton&quot; (2020), and the 2017 revival of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. On television, she won her first Emmy Award for the television film &quot;Wild Iris&quot; (2001), and had subsequent wins for the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; (2003–2004) and the miniseries &quot;John Adams&quot; (2008). From 2010 to 2013, she starred in the Showtime series &quot;The Big C&quot;, which won her a fourth Emmy in 2013, and from 2017 to 2022 she starred in the Netflix crime series &quot;Ozark&quot;.

As a film actress, Linney debuted with a minor role in &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; (1992) and went on to receive Academy Award nominations for the dramas &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; (2000), &quot;Kinsey&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Savages&quot; (2007). She is also known for her performances in &quot;Congo&quot; (1995), &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996), &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), &quot;Mystic River&quot; and &quot;Love Actually&quot; (both 2003), &quot;The Squid and the Whale&quot; (2005), &quot;The Nanny Diaries&quot; (2007), &quot;Hyde Park on Hudson&quot; (2012), &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot; (2015), &quot;Sully&quot; and &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; (both 2016).

==Early life and education==
Linney was born February 5, 1964, in Manhattan, New York City. Her mother, Miriam Anderson &quot;Ann&quot; Perse (née Leggett), was a nurse at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and her father, Romulus Zachariah Linney IV, was a playwright and professor. Linney spent summers with her father in New Hampshire and fell in love with the stage, working with the local theatre group beginning at the age of eleven. Linney&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather was Republican U.S. Congressman Romulus Zachariah Linney. She has a half-sister named Susan from her father&#x27;s second marriage.

Linney is a 1982 graduate of Northfield Mount Hermon School, a preparatory school in Massachusetts (which she serves as the chair of the Arts Advisory Council). She then attended Northwestern University before transferring to Brown University, where she studied acting with Jim Barnhill and John Emigh and served on the board of Production Workshop, the university&#x27;s student theater group. During her senior year at Brown, she performed in one of her father&#x27;s plays as Lady Ada Lovelace in a production of &quot;Childe Byron&quot;, a drama in which the poet Lord Byron mends a taut, distant relationship with his daughter Ada.
Linney graduated from Brown in 1986. and went on to study acting at the Juilliard School as a member of Group 19 (1986–90), which also included Jeanne Tripplehorn. In 2003, Linney received an honorary doctor of fine arts degree from Brown. She received an honorary doctor of fine arts degree from Juilliard when she delivered the school&#x27;s commencement address in 2009.

==Career==
===1990s===
Linney made her New York stage debut in 1990 as Nina in the Off Broadway adaptation of &quot;The Seagull&quot; set in the Hamptons. Conceived and directed by Jeff Cohen, the acclaimed production was mounted at the RAPP Arts Center in Alphabet City to great critical acclaim. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Best of all is Miss Linney&#x27;s Nina. From a naive, idealistic artist&#x27;s groupie with a streak of crazy determination, her Nina emerges as a woman who is a lot stronger and more complicated than the terminally wounded bird-woman that is the character&#x27;s traditional interpretation. Though deeply embittered at the end of the play, she is also fortified by a hard-won self-knowledge. Miss Linney projects the character&#x27;s ambiguities with stinging force and clarity. She is clearly a talent of enormous potential.&quot;

Linney first appeared in minor roles in a few early 1990s films, including &quot;Lorenzo&#x27;s Oil&quot; (1992), &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot; (1993), and &quot;Dave&quot; (1993). In 1993, Linney starred in the television adaptation of Armistead Maupin&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the City&quot; as Mary Ann Singleton. She returned as Mary Ann Singleton in 1998 in &quot;More Tales of the City&quot;. In October 1994, Linney guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (episode &quot;Blue Bamboo&quot;) as Martha Bowen. She played a blonde American singer who successfully claimed &quot;battered woman syndrome&quot; as a defense to the murder of a Japanese businessman.

Throughout the 1990s, Linney appeared on stage on Broadway and elsewhere including in &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, for which she won the 1994 Joe A. Callaway Award, and a revival of &quot;Holiday&quot; in December 1995 through January 1996 (the Philip Barry play upon which the 1938 movie starring Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn was based).

She was then cast in a series of thrillers, including &quot;Congo&quot; (1995), &quot;Primal Fear&quot; (1996) and &quot;Absolute Power&quot; (1997). She made her Hollywood breakthrough in 1998, praised for playing Jim Carrey&#x27;s on-screen wife Meryl Burbank in Peter Weir&#x27;s science-fiction comedy drama film &quot;The Truman Show&quot;.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, she starred in Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s film &quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; alongside Mark Ruffalo and Matthew Broderick. The film was met with positive reviews from critics with an approval rating of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. Linney was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as the small-town single mother Sammy Prescott. In 2001, she reprised her role as Mary Ann Singleton in &quot;Further Tales of the City&quot;. In 2002, she starred in &quot;Wild Iris&quot; alongside Gena Rowlands and won her first Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.

In 2002, she starred in the Broadway revival of &quot;The Crucible&quot; alongside Liam Neeson at the Virginia Theatre, which ran from March 2002 through June 2002. She received a Best Actress Tony Award nomination for her performance as John Proctor&#x27;s prudish wife Elizabeth.

<doc id="375671" wikidata="Q2249694" url="?curid=375671" title="Bedlington">
<text>Bedlington is a town and former civil parish in Northumberland, England, with a population of 18,470 measured at the 2011 Census.

Bedlington is an ancient market town, with a rich history of industry and innovative residents. Located roughly 10 miles northeast of Newcastle and Newcastle Airport, Bedlington is roughly 10 minutes from the A1 road, in southeast Northumberland. Other nearby places include Morpeth to the northwest, Ashington to the northeast, Blyth to the east and Cramlington to the south. In 1961 the parish had a population of 29,403.

The town has evidence of habitation from the Bronze Age, with a burial site being located just behind what is now the main Front Street. A cluster of Bronze Age cist burials were discovered during excavation of the site in the 1930s. St Cuthbert&#x27;s Church is the longest standing building in the town, with parts of this dating back to the 11th century and recently celebrated being 1000 years old. The church is in the heart of the original sandstone conservation town centre. Most of the medieval town has disappeared with many of the historic buildings and factories being demolished over the years, but there are still nods to medieval street layouts. The main Front Street is currently made up of Georgian and Victorian buildings.

At key points in history, before and during the Industrial Revolution, goods made in Bedlington made it to all corners of the globe through the distribution of nails and trains that were made in Bedlington from some 250 years ago. With large industry first being attracted to Bedlington over 250 years ago, in the form of its iron works, mining became an intrinsic part of Bedlington from 1838. The coal industry remained at the heart of the town until the closure of the mines in the 1980s. Today Bedlington&#x27;s Front Street is host to a number of well-established eating and drinking venues, and there is an emergence of new establishments and retailers entering the town.

The parish of Bedlington constituted the historic exclave of County Durham called Bedlingtonshire.

==History==
The place-name &quot;Bedlington&quot; is first attested &quot;circa&quot; 1050 in a biography of Saint Cuthbert, where it appears as &quot;Bedlingtun&quot;. The name means &quot;the town of Bedla&#x27;s people&quot;.

Bedlington and the hamlets belonging to it were bought by Cutheard, Bishop of Durham, between 900 and 915, and although locally in the county of Northumberland, it became part of the county palatine (from Lat. &quot;palatium&quot;, a palace) of Durham, over which Bishop Walcher was granted royal rights by William the Conqueror.

When these rights were taken from Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of Durham, in 1536, Bedlington among his other properties, lost its special privileges, but was confirmed to him in 1541 with the other property of his predecessors. Together with the other lands of the see of Durham, Bedlington was made over to the ecclesiastical commissioners in 1866. Bedlingtonshire was made part of Northumberland for civil purposes by acts of parliament in 1832 and 1844.

Bedlington became an industrial town with an iron works and several coal mines, however subsequent closure of these industries in the latter half of the 20th century caused the town to undergo many changes, becoming more of a dormitory town for those working in the surrounding areas. The last of the residential housing estates, formerly built for the mining families of the town, were taken over and razed by the council with residents evicted from the &#x27;Pit Rows&#x27; estate in the early to mid 1970s, as was part and parcel of the government&#x27;s national policy of this time.

The most important historic building in Bedlington was Bedlington Old Hall, which consisted of a 15th-century pele tower with a long early 18th-century stone block adjoining, occupying a prime location on the high street. It was controversially demolished in 1959 and replaced with council offices, which are now themselves empty and for sale.
The parish was abolished on 1 April 1974 and became an unparished area in Wansbeck district.

==Development==
The town has three supermarkets, a post office, and several other smaller shops.

A weekly market is held on Thursdays at the market place. The number of market stalls is now also starting to decline.

== Transport ==

=== Air and Sea ===
The nearest airport is Newcastle Airport, which provides scheduled domestic flights, flights covering many major cities in Europe, long haul international flights and holiday charter flights. There is a port in nearby North Shields with daily passenger services to IJmuiden in the Netherlands.

=== Bus ===
The town&#x27;s main bus operator is Arriva North East. Arriva links Bedlington to Ashington, Morpeth, Cramlington, Blyth, Stakeford and Newcastle. The X21/X22 bus services link Ashington, Guide Post, Bedlington Station, Regent Centre, Gosforth and Newcastle Haymarket. The X21/X22 provides a combined 10 minute service on Monday - Friday daytimes. The 2 bus service link Morpeth, Guide Post, Bedlington Station and Blyth.

=== Rail ===
Construction is currently underway on the construction of the Northumberland Line, which will reinstate passenger railway services from Ashington to Bedlington, Blyth, Seaton Delaval, Shiremoor and Newcastle. Passenger services are currently scheduled to begin operation in Bedlington in late 2024 or early 2025.

=== Road ===
The A189 Spine Road sits about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) east of the town centre and links Ashington, Blyth, Cramlington, Killingworth, Gosforth and Newcastle. The A1 is about 3 miles (4.8 km) from the town centre and provides connectivity to Scotland and London. The town also has other roads like the A193, A1068, A1147 and the B1331.

==Education==
Bedlington is served by two secondary schools: Bedlington Academy (previously Bedlingtonshire Community High School) and St Benet Biscop Catholic Academy. They are both in Bedlington, but they do take in children from Stakeford, Guide Post, Choppington, Stannington and even areas of Morpeth. Bedlington is also served by three primary schools: Bedlington Station Primary School, Stead Lane Primary School and St Bede&#x27;s Primary School. One of the few middle schools left in England is Meadowdale Academy. This is soon to change however as Meadowdale is to change to a primary school. The town of Bedlington also has two first schools: Whitley Memorial C of E School and Bedlington West End County First School. Whitley Memorial C of E School became a primary school at the start of the summer 2021 term. Pupils may also commute around south to Newcastle upon Tyne if they choose to attend an independent school.

One of the most important surviving historic buildings is the Anglican parish church, which is dedicated to St. Cuthbert. It is reputed that the church takes its dedication from an event that occurred 12 December 1069: fleeing northwards from the Conqueror&#x27;s army, the monks of Durham are said to have rested the body of St Cuthbert in Bedlington Church. The building, originally of Saxon design, was rebuilt about a hundred years later. Little of either the Saxon or the Norman church has survived.

There is a Roman Catholic congregation who worship in a relatively new church called St Bede&#x27;s. In addition, there is a Salvation Army chapel.

Hartford Hall lies within the parish. Much of the riverside land between Bedlington and the hall forms the Bedlington Country Park, a designated local nature reserve.

==Local media==
Local newspapers include the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Journal&quot;, which also cover Tyneside and the rest of southeast Northumberland. The &quot;Newspost Leader&quot; is weekly and covers most of the former district of Wansbeck. The community-run Bedlington Website Bedlington.co.uk was started in 1998. It has been active in many of the recent initiatives to promote the town.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle, Capital North East, Heart North East, Smooth North East, Hits Radio North East, and Koast Radio, a community based station. Local television news programmes are provided by &quot;ITV News Tyne Tees&quot; and &quot;BBC Look North&quot;.

<doc id="375673" wikidata="Q847131" url="?curid=375673" title="New Haven Colony">
<text>New Haven Colony was an English colony from 1638 to 1664 that included settlements on the north shore of Long Island Sound, with outposts in modern-day New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. The colony joined Connecticut Colony in 1664.

The history of the colony was a series of disappointments and failures. The most serious problem was that New Haven Colony never had a charter giving it legal title to exist. The larger, stronger colony of Connecticut to the north did have a charter. New Haven&#x27;s leaders were businessmen and traders, but they were never able to build up a large or profitable trade because their agricultural base was poor, farming the rocky soil was difficult, and the location was isolated.

==History==
In 1637, a group of London merchants and their families moved to Boston with the intention of creating a new settlement. The leaders were John Davenport, a Puritan minister, and Theophilus Eaton, a wealthy merchant who brought £3,000 to the venture. Both had experience in fitting out vessels for the Massachusetts Bay Company. The two ships that they chartered arrived in Boston on June 26, 1637. They learned about the area around the Quinnipiac River from militia engaged in the Pequot War, so Eaton set sail to view the area in late August. The site seemed ideal for trade, with a good port lying between Boston and the Dutch city of New Amsterdam on Manhattan and good access to the furs of the Connecticut River valley settlements of Hartford and Springfield.

Eaton returned to Boston, leaving seven men to remain through the winter and make preparations for the arrival of the rest of the company. The main body of settlers landed on April 14, 1638, numbering about 250, with the addition of some from Massachusetts. A number of the early dwellings were caves or &quot;cellers&quot;, partially underground and carved into hillsides.

===Founding as Quinnipiac===
The first English settlers gave their settlement the name Quinnipiac (rendered in various spellings, including “Quinipiek” in local records from the time). The name lasted until September 1, 1640 (O.S.), when records of the plantation’s general court note “This towne now named Newhaven [sic].”

The settlers had no official charter. Historian Edward Channing describes them as squatters, whereas author Edward Atwater holds that a land purchase from the local natives had been effected sometime before their arrival in April, although no written deed was signed until November 24, 1638. A second deed was made December 11, 1638 for a ten by thirteen mile tract north of the first purchase.

===Fundamental Agreement===
On October 25, 1639, the colonists adopted a &quot;Fundamental Agreement&quot; for self-government, partly as a result of a similar action in the Connecticut Colony. According to its terms, a court composed of 16 burgesses, i.e. voting citizens, was established to appoint a magistrate and officials and to conduct the business of the plantation. The only eligible voters were &quot;planters&quot; who were members of &quot;some or other of the approved Churches of New England&quot;. This excluded indentured servants, temporary residents, and transient persons, who were considered to have no permanent interest in the community.

They further determined &quot;that the word of God shall be the only rule to be attended unto in ordering the affairs of government in this plantation.&quot; Theophilus Eaton was chosen as the first Magistrate. As the Bible contains no reference to trial by jury, the colonists eliminated it and the magistrate sat in judgment.

This is said to have been one of &quot;the first examples in history of a written constitution organizing a government and defining its powers.&quot;

===Formation of New Haven Colony===
The plantation (or town) soon had neighboring settlements established by other groups of Puritans from England.:
* Nearby, two settlements independent of Quinnipiac formed: the settlement at Wepowauge (later known as Milford) by a land grant to English settlers from the Paugusset on February 12, 1639 and at Menunkatuck (later known as Guilford) by land grant to English settlers from the Quinnipiac on September 29, 1639. 
* Settlers from New Haven established Rippowam (later known as Stamford) and Southold on the North Fork of Long Island in 1640. 
* And about 1640, New Haven bought the land that became Greenwich from the Siwanoy Indians. Through the intrigues of Dutch Gov. Peter Stuyvesant, the first inhabitants revolted with the Dutch.

On October 23, 1643, in the context of the formation of the New England Confederation, composed of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth and Connecticut Colonies, for joint military action against threats of attack by natives, the New Haven Plantation and its subsidiary settlements, Stamford and Southhold on Long Island, were combined with the independent towns of Milford and Guilford and named the New Haven Colony which then joined the Confederation. The town of Branford was settled in 1644 by residents from Wethersfield, Connecticut Colony, who were dissatisfied with the theocratic rule there. They joined the New Haven Colony. Eaton served as governor of the new colony until his death in 1658.

===Expansion of the Colony===
In 1641, the colony claimed the area that is now South Jersey and Philadelphia after buying land south of Trenton along the Delaware River from the Lenape tribe. Cape May, New Jersey and Salem, New Jersey were among the communities that were founded.

The treaty with the Lenape placed no westward limit on the land west of the Delaware, which became the legal basis for a Connecticut &quot;sea to sea&quot; claim of owning all the land on both sides of the Delaware from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. This set the stage for the Pennamite-Yankee War of 150 years later.

In 1642, 50 families on a ship captained by George Lamberton settled at the mouth of Schuylkill River to establish the trading post at what is today Philadelphia. The Dutch and Swedes who were already in the area burned their buildings, and a court in New Sweden convicted Lamberton of &quot;trespassing, conspiring with the Indians.&quot; The New Haven Colony did not get any support from its New England patrons, and Puritan Governor John Winthrop testified that the &quot;Delaware Colony&quot; &quot;dissolved&quot; owing to &quot;sickness and mortality.&quot;

===Phantom ship legend===

With no ships of its own, the colony had to do all of its trade through Massachusetts. Accordingly Theophilus Eaton commissioned the construction of a 150-ton trade ship for the colony. The ship was quite poorly constructed but nonetheless after some difficulty was sent out of the Long Island Sound and off to England. The ship would never be seen again. According to Cotton Mather in his Magnalia Christi Americana, the settlers gathered on the beach where they saw a detailed vision of a ship in the aftermath of a storm. The fate of the ship was depicted in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 1847 poem &quot;The Phantom Ship.&quot;

===Harboring the regicide judges===
In 1660, following the Stuart Restoration, Edward Whalley and his son-in-law William Goffe, two of the 59 commissioners who signed the 1649 execution warrant of Charles I, fled England to North America. They sought protection from agents of Charles II, who intended to bring them to justice. In 1661 they arrived in New Haven. John Davenport arranged for them to hide in the hills northwest of the town. They purportedly took refuge in a rock formation in present-day West Rock Ridge State Park. Another regicide commissioner, John Dixwell, joined them at a later time.

Three Judges&#x27; Cave today bears a historical marker in their name.

===Merger with Connecticut Colony===
New Haven urgently needed a royal charter, but the colony had made enemies in London by hiding and protecting the regicide judges. An uneasy competition ruled New Haven&#x27;s relations with the larger and more powerful Connecticut River settlements centered on Hartford. New Haven published a complete legal code in 1656, but the law remained very much church-centered. A major difference between the New Haven and Connecticut colonies was that the Connecticut Colony permitted other churches to operate on the basis of &quot;sober dissent&quot;, while the New Haven Colony only permitted the Puritan church to exist. A royal charter was issued to Connecticut in 1662, ending New Haven&#x27;s period as a separate colony, and its towns were merged into the government of Connecticut Colony in 1664.

== Founding of Newark ==

A group of New Haven colonists led by Robert Treat and others moved to establish a new community in New Jersey in 1666, seeking to maintain the Puritan religious exclusivism and theocracy that was lost with the New Haven Colony&#x27;s merger with Connecticut Colony. Treat wanted to name the new community after Milford, Connecticut. However Abraham Pierson was to urge that the new community be named &quot;New Ark&quot; or &quot;New Work&quot; which was to evolve into the name Newark, New Jersey.

<text>In mountaineering and climbing, a first ascent (abbreviated to FA in guide books), is the first successful documented climb to the top of a mountain or the top of a particular climbing route. Early 20th-century mountaineers and climbers focused on reaching the tops of iconic mountains (e.g. the eight-thousanders) and climbing routes (e.g. the great north faces of the Alps) by whatever means possible, often using considerable amounts of aid climbing, and/or with large expedition style support teams that laid &quot;siege&quot; to the climb. 

As all the key tops were summited, the manner in which each top was reached became important, particularly the ability to complete the ascent without artificial aid, which is called free climbing. In free climbing, the term first free ascent (abbreviated FFA) is used where a mountain or climbing route is ascended without any artificial aid (devices for protection in the event of a fall could be used as long as they did not aid progression). Completing the FFA of a climbing route is often called freeing (or more latterly sending) a route.

As the sport of climbing developed, additional types of ascent became notable and chronicled in guidebooks and journals. In mountaineering, and alpine climbing in particular, the first winter ascent is recorded, given the significantly greater difficulty. The first solo ascent is also commonly noted, although the first free solo ascent is a more controversial aspect, given the concerns about advocating such a dangerous form of climbing. With the rise in female participation in climbing, the first female free ascent (or FFFA) has also become notable.

== In mountaineering and alpinism==

As mountaineering developed in the 20th century, the attainment of a summit by almost any means was replaced by ascents that reflected the style used and the conditions faced. In 2008, the most prestigious annual prize in mountaineering, the Piolet d&#x27;Or, amended its focus to small light-weight alpine-style teams using no form of aid or support, rather than on large expedition-style teams using &quot;siege&quot; techniques.

The most notable types of mountaineering first ascents that are chronicled are:

* First ascent. The most notable first ascents started with the golden age of alpinism when the main alpine peaks were summited (and often using aid climbing). In the 1930s, the focus moved to the first ascents of the great north faces of the Alps, and the Eiger in particular. The 1950s saw the first ascents of most of the fourteen eight-thousanders, and Everest in particular. By the 1980s, the rock spires of Trango Towers in the Karakorum, and Torres del Paine in Patagonia also had first ascents.

* First winter ascent. The winter climbing season is between December 21 and March 20. The first winter ascents of the great north faces of the Alps were a coveted prize, particularly the &quot;Trilogy&quot; of the three hardest, the Eiger, the Matterhorn, and the Grandes Jorasses. The most notable first winter ascents were the Himalayan and Karakoram eight-thousanders, where the hardest, K2, was only summited in winter in 2021 (66 years after its first ascent) and considered a &quot;holy grail&quot; of mountaineering prizes. 

* First alpine-style (or unsupported) ascent. In 2008, the charter of the prestigious Piolet d&#x27;Or prize was amended to focus on small teams with no support making fast, but riskier, ascents on routes that had previously been done by expeditions (called alpine style). Multiple Piolet d&#x27;Or winners, whose ascents embodied this style, included Marko Prezelj, Mick Fowler, and Ueli Steck. The charter was amended to de-incentivize excessive risk-taking after several winners died (e.g. David Lama, and Hansjörg Auer).

* First solo ascent. The most dangerous form of alpine-style ascent is the solo climbing ascent, performed by a single climber. The first solo ascents of the alpine north faces, including the first solo winter ascents, were coveted (the winter solo &quot;Trilogy&quot; was completed by Ivano Ghirardini in 1977–78); one of the most famous practitioners was the Italian Walter Bonatti. Himalayan solo ascents are also coveted, although problems around verification are more frequent due to the more remote nature of the routes, with notable disputes such as Tomo Česen&#x27;s first solo ascent of the south face of Lhotse.

==In rock climbing==

In rock climbing, the manner in which the first free ascent was achieved became important to chronicle by climbing journals and magazines. The key differentiators were the style on which the route was free climbed (e.g. traditional climbing, sport climbing, or free solo climbing), whether the free climb was done on the first attempt (e.g. onsighted), and whether the climber had prior information (e.g. beta) on that first attempt.

The most notable types of rock climbing first ascents that are chronicled are:

* First free ascent (traditional climbing only). Pre-1980s, the FFAs were by traditional climbing techniques. A distinction was recorded if a climber practiced the moves on a top rope, called &quot;headpointing&quot;, although with the post-1980s dominance of &quot;redpointing&quot; as the definition of an FFA, such a distinction was dropped. FFAs that set new grade milestones are notable, for both male and female climbers.

:* First greenpoint ascent (traditional climbing only). In the 2010s, traditional climbers used greenpointing (as a counterpoint to a &quot;redpoint&quot;), to describe climbing a pre-bolted sport climbing route, but only using &quot;traditional protection&quot; (i.e. protection that is not permanently fixed via pre-placed bolts or pitons). Sonnie Trotter&#x27;s greenpoint of &quot;The Path&quot; (5.14a R, 2007), is a notable example.

* First redpoint ascent (sport climbing only). In the 1980s, climbers wanted to ascend routes that had no opportunities for traditional climbing protection, and they had to be pre-bolted with protection (but not aid), which was called sport climbing. Sport climbing has since set all new grade milestones in rock climbing. The &quot;redpoint&quot; became the accepted definition for what determined a &quot;first free ascent&quot; in sport climbing. 

* First repeat ascent (traditional or sport climbing). The grading of a route can be complicated as the person making the FFA had no prior information or beta. The first repeat is therefore chronicled for confirmation of a grade, particularly when a new grade milestone is proposed. For the highest grades, the first repeat can take years (e.g. &quot;Action Directe&quot; or &quot;Jumbo Love&quot;), or even decades (e.g. &quot;&quot;).

* First onsight ascent (traditional or sport climbing). An FFA that was onsighted, means it was done at the very first attempt, and without prior information (or beta). Climbing journals chronicle the progression of grade milestones of onsights both male and female climbers. 

:* First flash ascent (traditional or sport climbing). An FFA that was flashed, means it was done at the first attempt, but with prior information (or beta). Climbing journals chronicle the progression of grade milestones for flashed routes by male and female climbers. With the availability of route beta online (e.g. videos of prior ascents), the distinction between onsight and flash ascents has diminished.

* First free solo ascent (independent of traditional or sport climbing). Free soloing is practiced by a smaller community of climbers and is a controversial area given the risks undertaken and whether such risks should be recorded and thus implicitly endorsed. Free solo climbing grade milestones are chronicled, the most notable being &quot;Free Solo&quot;, the Oscar-winning film of Alex Honnold&#x27;s first free solo ascent of &quot;Freerider&quot; in Yosemite.

===Gender===

* First female free ascent (abbreviated FFFA). Important female climbers emerged in the 1980s including Lynn Hill and Catherine Destivelle and climbing journals began to chronicle milestones in female first free ascents. In some cases, an FFFA is also an FFA, the most famous example being Lynn Hill&#x27;s 1993 FFA/FFFA of the 3,000-foot &quot;Nose&quot; on El Capitan (5.14a/b), considered the biggest prize in big wall climbing, announced by Hill to the world&#x27;s climbing media by: &quot;It goes, boys&quot;. By the 2000s, Josune Bereziartu, Angela Eiter, and Ashima Shiraishi closed the gap to the highest sport climbing grades achieved by men to within one/two notches, while Beth Rodden had fully closed the gap for traditional climbing.

==Notable disputes==

There have been notable disputes over claims of a first ascent (or first free ascent), for various reasons (disputes over the style employed, issues with verifiability, accusations of bad faith and fraud), and the most notable are where a new grade milestone and/or major advancement in difficulty is being proposed:

===Mountaineering===

* First ascent of Everest: Arguably the most famous case of an unverified first ascent is whether George Mallory and/or Andrew Irvine reached the summit of Everest on the 1924 Everest expedition. Subsequent Everest expeditions have not been able to answer the question including the 1999 Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, and the 2007 Altitude Everest expedition.

* First ascent of Cerro Torre: In 1959, Cesare Maestri claimed he and summited, but that Egger who had the camera, was swept to his death by an avalanche on the descent. Lionel Terry called it &quot;the greatest climbing feat of all time&quot;. Inconsistencies in Maestri&#x27;s account, and the lack of equipment on the route, led most to doubt his claim. Maestri further inflamed the controversy by returning in 1970 and drilling 400 bolts onto his new &quot;Compressor Route&quot;, to claim the second ascent. In 2012, yet more controversy followed when American climbers Hayden Kennedy and Jason Kruk, removed Maestri&#x27;s bolts, enabling David Lama and Peter Ortner to make the FFA, for which all four won a 2013 Piolet d&#x27;Or.

===Rock climbing===

* In 1995, French climber Fred Rouhling created a major controversy when he proposed &quot;&quot; as the world&#x27;s first-ever route, when the highest grade at the time, &quot;Action Directe&quot;, was only at . Rouhling faced an unprecedented level of personal vilification from parts of the climbing community on whether he had actually climbed the route, as all other attempts had failed. In 2020, Sébastien Bouin made the first repeat of &quot;Akira&quot; and estimated its grade at , a grade Rouhling has climbed on other routes, and thus his FFA became accepted.

* In 2003, Spanish climber Bernabé Fernández proposed &quot;&quot; as the world&#x27;s first-ever route, when the highest grade at the time, &quot;Realization&quot;, was at . As with Fred Rouhling on &quot;Akira&quot;, his claim provoked a significant backlash from parts of the climbing community and even accusations that he never completed an FFA (the person who belayed him could not be identified to help verification). The route was repeated in 2011 by Adam Ondra who downgraded it, and further repeats reduced its grade to circa .

<text>Caversham is a village and suburb of Reading in Berkshire, England, located directly north of Reading town centre across the River Thames. Caversham rises from the River Thames, lying on flood plain and the lowest reaches of the Chiltern Hills. Two road bridges, including Caversham Bridge, and two footbridges join Caversham to the rest of Reading. Named areas within the village include Emmer Green, Lower Caversham, Caversham Heights and Caversham Park Village. Notable landmarks include Caversham Court, a public park and former country house; Caversham Lakes; and part of the Thames Path national trail. 

Recorded as early as 1086, Caversham was a village part of the Henley district of Oxfordshire (it is located around south west of Henley). With the exception of the centre of Caversham and Emmer Green, which were traditional villages, much of the development occurred during the 20th century. In 1911, it was transferred to Berkshire and became part of the county borough of Reading.

==History==
 
The first written description of Caversham as Cavesham appeared in the Domesday Book (1086) within the hundred of Binfield. This entry indicates that a sizeable community had developed with a considerable amount of land under cultivation. Robert de Montfort and Henry of Essex fought in front of Henry II under a bridge by the village. The martial Earl of Pembroke, who was a protector of Henry III, died in Caversham in the 13th century.

Some time before 1106 a shrine to the Virgin Mary was established in Caversham. Its precise location is unknown, but it may have been near the present St Peter&#x27;s Church. It became a popular place of pilgrimage, along with the chapel of St. Anne on the bridge and her well, whose waters were believed to have healing properties. By the 15th century the statue was plated in silver; Catherine of Aragon is recorded as visiting here on 17 July 1532. The shrine was destroyed on 14 September 1538 under the command of Henry VIII. Only the well survives, now dry and surrounded by a protective wall, topped with a domed iron grill. A modern shrine to Our Lady has been re-established at the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady and St. Anne.

In the Middle Ages Caversham Manor was one of the demesnes of William Marshal, Earl of Pembroke and regent during King Henry III&#x27;s minority. It was the place of his death. The medieval community was clustered on the north side of Caversham Bridge east of St Peter&#x27;s Church, which was built in the 12th century. The third Earl of Buckingham donated the land for the church and neighbouring rectory, together with a considerable amount of land around it, to the Augustinian Notley Abbey near Long Crendon in Buckinghamshire. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, these lands were given to Christ Church. The rectory stood in what is now Caversham Court park and herb garden where there are remains with information panels and flat foundation stones as well as a ha ha wall below giving a view over the River Thames and much of Reading and Tilehurst.

In the Civil War there was fierce fighting around Caversham Bridge for a short time in April 1643. Reading had been held by Royalists and was besieged by a Parliamentary force under the Earl of Essex. Royalists marched south from Oxford to try to relieve the town&#x27;s defenders but were heavily defeated, and the town fell to the Parliamentarians a few days later. The fortified manor house was replaced by Caversham House and Park in the 16th century. Several houses have stood on the site, notably the home of William Cadogan. The present Caversham Park House, built in 1850, was occupied by BBC Monitoring from 1943 until 2018, analysing news, information and comment gathered from mass media around the world. The BBC Written Archives Centre is still based on part of the site. 

== Governance ==
Caversham is entirely within the borough of Reading and forms all or part of four of the borough&#x27;s sixteen electoral wards: Caversham, Caversham Heights, Emmer Green and Thames wards. Caversham is in the Reading Central parliamentary constituency, currently represented by Matt Rodda of the Labour Party. The 2016 Boundary Commission review recommended moving one of Caversham&#x27;s wards, Mapledurham, into the Reading West parliamentary constituency, but after consultation, this proposal was reverted in the 2018 recommendations.

===Administrative history===
Caversham was an ancient parish in the Binfield hundred of Oxfordshire. The parish historically extended from the banks of the Thames northwards into the Chiltern Hills, and included the area around Kidmore End. Kidmore End was made a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1853.

The reduced ecclesiastical parish of Caversham (excluding the Kidmore End ecclesiastical parish) was made a local government district in 1891. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894. Also in 1894, the civil parish of Caversham was reduced to match the urban district, and Kidmore End became a separate civil parish.

Caversham Urban District was abolished in 1911, with the area becoming part of the county borough of Reading on 9 November 1911, except for the Caversham Park area, which was transferred instead to the neighbouring parish of Eye and Dunsden. This also had the effect of transferring Caversham from Oxfordshire to the geographical county of Berkshire. In 1911 the civil parish had a population of 9,858. Caversham had no council of its own after 1911, but was classed as an urban parish within the borough of Reading. The parish of Caversham was finally abolished on 1 April 1916, when the parish of Reading was enlarged to cover the whole borough. The Caversham Park area east of Caversham and part of the parish of Mapledurham west of Caversham were subsequently transferred into the borough of Reading in 1977.

== Geography ==
The shopping area and immediate residential surrounds that form Central Caversham are surrounded by more recent developments that form bolt-on additions to the suburb: Caversham Heights on the higher ground to the west, Lower Caversham to the south east, and Caversham Park Village to the north east on what was the parkland of Caversham Park. Emmer Green, to the north, is an older village but is generally considered part of Caversham. Elevations of homes vary from 37m above mean sea level to 92m at the top of Caversham Park, three metres short of the highest point in the east of the area. The bank of the river has the Thames Path National Trail except to the west of Caversham, where it reverses banks at Reading Bridge.

Between Mapledurham on the Thames and Caversham Heights, adjoining their respective golf courses is a western narrow outcrop of the northern foothills that reaches 95m AOD. The low Chiltern Hills on the north bank of the River Thames are therefore higher than the land on the opposite bank, providing wide views to the south. On the northern edge of Caversham is the Local nature reserve of Clayfield Copse. The carved Caversham village sign, carved by a local craftsman, is mounted on a tall Oak post in the village centre.

== Demography ==
Caversham including Emmer Green (the north bank) had: 22.1% of its homes being socially or privately rented in 2011, whereas the borough had 42.4%. This broad area had 20.4% of Reading&#x27;s population and 23.5% of the borough, with the north bank&#x27;s homes occupying 29.1% of the footprint of the whole borough&#x27;s homes. It had 5.7% of the borough&#x27;s non-domestic buildings footprint. The same figures (where Emmer Green is excluded from analysis) are that Caversham more narrowly defined, as is becoming more common, saw 24.8% of its homes rented against the borough&#x27;s 42.4%, the same area had 15.3% of Reading&#x27;s population and 16.4% of the borough&#x27;s area with its homes occupying 20.6% of the footprint of the whole borough&#x27;s homes. It had 4.3% of the borough&#x27;s non-domestic buildings footprint.

At the 2011 census the proportion of homes that were rented as opposed to owned was close to 50% of the average for the borough. The area had 15.3% of Reading&#x27;s population and 16.4% of the borough&#x27;s area. In keeping with a suburb, in 2005 the Office for National Statistics land use statistics published with the census, Caversham had 4.3% of the non-domestic buildings. Almost wholly low rise where developed, its homes occupied 20.6% of the footprint of all homes in the borough.

== Transport ==
Caversham Bridge, Reading Bridge, Christchurch Bridge, and Caversham Lock provide crossing points (the last two for pedestrians only), with Sonning Bridge also available a few miles east of Caversham. While Caversham does not have a railway station of its own, Reading railway station is a short walk from both Reading Bridge and Caversham Bridge.

== Education ==
There is one local authority secondary school in Caversham, Highdown School. Many children from the area also attend Maiden Erlegh Chiltern Edge in South Oxfordshire. In the independent sector, Queen Anne&#x27;s School educates girls between the ages of 11 and 18, Hemdean House School has mixed infants and junior schools, and a girls senior school. There is also Caversham Preparatory School, which takes children from ages 3 to 11. There are several primary schools in Caversham including Caversham Primary School, Caversham Park Primary School, Emmer Green Primary School, The Hill Primary School, St. Anne&#x27;s RC Primary School, St. Martin&#x27;s RC Primary School, Micklands Primary School and Thameside Primary School.

There is a shortage of primary school places in the west of Caversham, but a 2006 proposal to use part of Mapledurham playing fields to build a replacement for Caversham Primary School did not receive public support. A new Heights Primary School took its first pupils in September 2014 in temporary accommodation, and has not yet found a permanent site. The Education Funding Authority acquired a site (previously residential) in Upper Warren Avenue during 2014, but there was criticism of the choice from local residents. After representations from affected constituents, the local MP, Rob Wilson, intervened. Following discussions with the EFA, Reading Borough Council was commissioned to work with local stakeholders on alternative sites. Five possibilities were proposed – two parks, a wildlife site, a residential site and a field in adjoining Oxfordshire. The subsequent consultation showed a clear preference for occupying a small part of Mapledurham playing fields (5%).

The consultation is not binding, and there remain some legal difficulties. It is in trust for recreation purposes and was gifted by the late Mr Hewett to residents of Mapledurham and Reading. Yet there would also be significant benefits for the community; the children of the area would have a school within walking distance, the recreation land would be used by the community more and the centre of Caversham&#x27;s traffic would be reduced. Caversham has several nursery schools, one of which, New Bridge Nursery School was assessed by Ofsted in 2011 as &#x27;outstanding&#x27;. Chiltern College, once a training school for childminders, now provides training in all aspects of child care, and claims to be the only childcare training college in the United Kingdom with its own nurseries, school, training college and residential accommodation on campus.

==Sport==
Caversham AFC is one of the largest youth football clubs in the area with many of its girls&#x27; and boys&#x27; youth teams competing in the top divisions of local leagues. Caversham AFC&#x27;s main ground is Clayfield Copse, commonly referred to as &quot;Swan&#x27;s Lair&quot; because the mascot for the team is a swan. In previous seasons, Highdown School has been used as Caversham AFC&#x27;s training ground. The club colours are red and black. Their main rivals are Caversham Trents FC who also have boys teams competing in many of the same divisions as their AFC counterparts who are also known to use Highdown School as their training ground. The club colours are blue and white and their main ground is Mapledurham Playing Fields. The Albert Road recreation ground offers facilities for tennis, croquet, and bowls.

== Religious sites ==
There are many Anglican churches in the Caversham area. St Peter&#x27;s is the parish church of the Caversham, Thameside, and Mapledurham parish, which also includes St John&#x27;s and St Margaret&#x27;s, in the neighbouring Mapledurham village. There are also two Methodist Churches, the Catholic church of Our Lady and St. Anne, Caversham Baptist Church, Grace Church Caversham (which is part of Newfrontiers, and the Pentacostal New Testament Church of God. Caversham Park Village Church meets in Caversham Park Primary School each Sunday and is an ecumenical project made up of Anglicans, Baptists and Methodists. Finally, Caversham Evangelical Church meets at the Youth and Community Centre in Emmer Green.

<doc id="375679" wikidata="Q5585305" url="?curid=375679" title="Gordon Honeycombe">
<text>Ronald Gordon Honeycombe (27 September 1936 – 9 October 2015) was a British newscaster, author, playwright and stage actor.

Honeycombe was born in Karachi, in British India. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and read English at University College, Oxford. He completed National Service with the Royal Artillery, mainly in Hong Kong, where he was also an announcer with Radio Hong Kong. Returning to the UK, he embarked on an acting career which led to television and public prominence as a national newscaster with ITN.

He later settled in Perth, Western Australia, where he continued to work in radio, television and theatre, and was regularly engaged in voice-over work for radio and television, and in documentary narrations.

==Career highlights==
Honeycombe joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, working from 1962 to 1964 as an actor at Stratford-upon-Avon and at the Aldwych Theatre, London. From 1965 to 1977 at ITN, he became nationally known as a newscaster. He was twice voted the most popular newscaster in Britain, by readers of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and of &quot;The Sun&quot;. From 1977 to 1984, he concentrated on writing, while continuing many other activities, such as presenting television shows for Scottish Television, Southern Television and for the BBC. He returned to regular newsreading from 1984 to 1989 as chief newsreader at TV-am. He was voted the most popular male TV newscaster by readers of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot; magazine in 1986, and received the Television and Radio Industries Club Newscaster of the Year Award in 1989. 

While appearing on British television, he also recorded voice-overs or narrations of many television and other documentaries, and was involved in various training films, industrial presentations, conferences, in-house videos and fund-raising charity events. He produced and directed his own play &quot;The Redemption&quot; for the Festival of Perth in Western Australia, in March 1990, and settled in that area.

==Appearances==
Beside the appearances listed below, Honeycombe also presented, appeared in and narrated many television programmes and appeared in various television plays and series.

==Works==
From 1965, as well as his own books, Honeycombe wrote for television, radio, stage and films. One of his best-known books is the horror novel &quot;Neither the Sea Nor the Sand&quot;. Early in his career, Honeycombe wrote two horror novels, described by horror historian Stefan R Dziemianowicz as &quot;atmospheric modern gothics whose rugged natural northern English settings resonate with their unsparing supernatural horrors.&quot; 

The first of these novels, &quot;Neither the Sea Nor the Sand&quot;, tells the story of a woman whose dead lover returns to life. It was followed by &quot;Dragon Under the Hill&quot;, where a history professor in Northumberland finds himself re-enacting a tragedy that took place in the Viking era. Dziemianowicz said that since Honeycombe&#x27;s books were published before the horror boom of the 1970s, they have been &quot;greatly overlooked as a result&quot;.

<text>Freeman Woodcock Thorpe (or Thorp; June 16, 1844 – October 20, 1922), born in Geneva, Ohio, was an American painter who painted portraits of many notable people such as Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley, Grover Cleveland, Ulysses Grant, Simon Cameron, Salmon Chase, Robert Smith, Horace Greeley, Walter Forward and Robert E. Lee. He was also a state legislator in Ohio and a soldier.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Freeman Thorpe was born in Geneva, Ohio in 1844 to Clarissa Thorpe. His father may have been Dennis Thorpe, the first mayor of Geneva, though it has also been suggested that his father was Squire Thorpe, a local justice of the peace. He apparently began practicing his skills with art from an early age. At the age of 16 or 17, Thorpe first encountered Abraham Lincoln as his inaugural train traveled through Geneva on February 15, 1861. This is said to be when Thorpe created his first sketch of Lincoln.

When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Thorpe enlisted with the 2nd Ohio Cavalry Regiment, serving as a scout in southern Missouri. He is also said to have carried a missive from camp in Tennessee to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. As a reward, Stanton arranged for Thorpe to be placed close to Lincoln as he gave his address at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on November 19, 1863. He also sketched the President on this occasion.

===Artwork===
Following the war, Thorpe trained as a photographer under the instruction of his sister, Ruby M. Thorpe, and also began teaching himself to paint portraits. He left Ruby&#x27;s studio in 1869 or 1870 to open his own photography studio in Bucyrus, Ohio. Through the 1870s, he gained popularity, especially among politicians in Washington, D.C. Ulysses S. Grant, who Thorpe had met during the Civil War, helped to arrange for him to have a studio space above the Senate wing in the United States Capitol. Between his Capitol studio, his studio in Geneva, and travel around the country, Thorpe is estimated to have created roughly 600 works. His subjects included presidents, governors, Congressmen, Cabinet members, generals, and other well-known figures of his day.

===Later life and death===
In addition to his artistic endeavors, Thorpe was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1878, a position he held for four terms. He also served as a commander of the Ohio National Guard until 1885, and achieved the rank of colonel through his service.

In the 1890s, he moved to Crow Wing County, Minnesota due to ill health, and began to farm trees on his land there. He also continued painting until his death. Arguably his most well-known work, a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, was commissioned by the United States Senate in 1920, and the painting hangs in the United States Capitol today.

Thorpe died in Crow Wing County on October 20, 1922, at the age of 78.

==Marriage and children==

Freeman Thorpe married Orlena Eggleston (1847-1919) in Geneva, Ohio in 1865. They had four children:
* Nellie I. (Thorpe) Rowland (1867-1900)
* Clark L. Thorpe (1869-1896)
* Anna A. (Thorpe) Benson (1879-1969)
* Sarah E. (Thorpe) Heald (1881-1954)

<text>Delta Motor Corporation was a South African car manufacturer, which was created through a management buy-out after General Motors (GM) divested from South Africa in 1986. It was headed by former GM executive, Bob Price, who had returned to South Africa from Detroit. He had previously served as General Motors South Africa&#x27;s managing director between 1971 and 1974, and later became president of Motors Trading Corp., a subsidiary that engages in international trade on behalf of GM.

Delta continued to use the Opel, Isuzu and Suzuki brands under licence from GM as well as pay for the supply of assembly kits. Delta also exported small numbers of cars to neighboring, right-hand drive markets. Delta Motor Corporation introduced a number of efficiencies and performed considerably better than GM ZA had been able to do.

Following the transition to universal suffrage in the 1990s, GM acquired a 49 percent stake in the company in 1997 and in 2004 the company once again became a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors, reverting to its original name, General Motors South Africa. GM ZA also assembled vehicles for export to other right hand drive markets in the region, such as Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Kenya, and Mauritius.

<text>Leicester Market is a market in The City of Leicester, England, on Market Place just south of the clock tower. It is around 800 years old and was moved to the current site around 700 years ago. It is the largest outdoor covered market in Europe.

It is open Monday to Saturday 9 am– 6 pm and has over 10 to 15 stalls. The outdoor market sells a wide variety of goods, particularly fruit and vegetables, but also flowers, clothes, second-hand-books, bric-a-brac and jewellery. It also has a number of permanent units, containing clothes, cosmetics, fabrics, greetings cards, a cafe and pet products.

The former indoor market, built in 1973, was a multi-level building containing the fish market and delicatessen, as well as stalls selling clothes, haberdashery, footwear, jewellery, gemstones, and confectionery. It was demolished between December 2014 /June 2015 and the levelled site turned into New Market Square. The traders who were based there either moved to the new Food Hall - built adjacent to The Corn Exchange as a partial replacement and opened in April 2014 – or to stalls on the Outdoor Market.

In the centre of the market stands the Leicester Corn Exchange (1850), originally built as a trading centre, but now serving as a bar and restaurant. A statue of John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland stands close to the Corn Exchange.

A monthly Farmers&#x27; Market is held nearby on Gallowtree Gate on the last Wednesday of every month, specializing in locally produced organic meat, fruit and vegetables.

==History==
The market is protected by a Royal Charter that goes back to its origin over 700 years ago. This prohibits other markets from operating within a specified distance (6 miles) of the Leicester market.

In recent years the City Council which holds the Royal Charter has begun to allow some other markets within the City. In 2009 the City Council proposed to grant a licence to a private market promoter to operate a Sunday Market at the Walkers Stadium.
